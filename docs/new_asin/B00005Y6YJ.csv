1675455,5,B00005Y6YJ,"After being a faithful viewer of ""Oz"" for the past 5 seasons I am greatful for the release of ""Oz"" on DVD and can't wait for the 2nd season to be released.  What I like about ""Oz"" is that it is a great Drama that crosses the boundry of conventional television.",1015545600,,260,4.098039215686274
1675456,5,B00005Y6YJ,"It's easy to see why ""OZ"" has proven itself as the finest dramatic series on TV up there with ""Six Feet Under"" and ""The Sopranos"" (all cable, all courtesy of HBO.)  For pure heart-stopping action, debauchery and in-your-face shock value, though, even the mob doesn't stand a chance!  The characters here are sharply drawn and completely rendered by a cast that takes risks every week along with the plotlines that unfold.  The first season is more than just a brilliant showcase for the actors, directors and writers at work here - it's also THE crucial link to understanding fully everything that comes later in years 2 and 3.  Unquestionably violent, but worth it's weight in cadavers, OZ delivers unforgettable television drama.  Surely the set to own this Summer!",1015372800,19,767,4.9609375
1675457,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Oz is decidedly not for the faint of heart. That said, the first (and best) season's episodes were beautifully constructed, exceptionally well-written, and wonderfully cast. The inside/outside viewpoints offered by the wheelchair-bound narrator provide not only the backgrounds of the inmates but also the philosophical point of each episode. There is much graphic violence, moments of such painful truth (Tergesen in paricular turns in an award-winning performance throughout) and such horror, that one is utterly drained by the emotional turbulence. Next to Six Feet Under, HBO's other brave and clever award-winning show, Oz is one of the best examples of what television can be when the targeted audience is more than eight years old. Most highly recommended.",1013990400,52,763,5.52991452991453
1675458,5,B00005Y6YJ,"If not for the harsh images depicted by the show, OZ would easily join The Sorpranos and Sex in the City in HBO's great award winning tradition.  In my opinion the acting on this show passes that of the rest of HBO's sunday night line up by leaps and bounds.  There is just no contest. No other series demands as high levels of skilland ability to dive into the darker sides of human nature as the unapologetic landscape of OZ, one which people who have actually served prison feel comes as close to the real thing as possible.",1013731200,2,527,4.36734693877551
1675459,5,B00005Y6YJ,"i will be counting down the days until this dvd comes out. people praise the sopranos and sex and the city, but this show kicks the crap out of them. acting is superb, story lines crazy as hell. i cant describe it very well, but just get it. YOU'LL LOVE IT.",1012953600,,257,4.0588235294117645
1675460,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Finally HBO gets with the program and releases one of their best shows to DVD.  Oz is full of interesting characters and plot twists, plus great actors who give their all and then some.  Lee Tergesen (Tobias Beecher) especially does a terrific job as the naive new inmate to Emerald City, the experimental unit in the Oswald State Penetentiary.  This hard-hitting, pulls no punches highly addictive prison drama is well worth owning.  Hopefully, the next few seasons will be released as quickly as possible following this first season.  Many more interesting characters and plot lines await!  One of the best shows ever, let alone one of the best prison shows.",1012953600,4,660,4.954545454545454
1675461,5,B00005Y6YJ,"When ""Oz"" first debuted on HBO several years ago, no one was prepared for the intensity and the immense talent portrayed therein.  I, for one, was blown away.  You cannot watch this show and not be impacted in some way.  For all of its harsh and unflinching realism, the emotion under the surface is what makes this the most well-written series on television today.  These people know their craft, and they prove it season after season.
Like so many others, I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time.  Yes, ""The Sopranos"" is a great show, and ""Sex in the City"" can be very impressive, but ""Oz"" surpasses them all.  I can only hope that HBO releases subsequent seasons on DVD much faster than they normally do for their other shows.  Five Stars!",1012867200,22,749,4.544776119402985
1675462,5,B00005Y6YJ,"The first season of Oz was the greatest! As I write this, Oz is still on tv during it's 6th season. This is a must have for fans of HBO programing. This show came out before Sopranos and Sex and The City and I've always liked Oz the most. The acting is superb. The first three seasons were its prime in writing. Now I feel the show is going downhill. The characters are getting weaker and weaker and there seems to be more and more (...) shots. (Ex: Season 4 or 5 was a scene in which a prisoner in the whole was (...) in a bucket and the audience got to see this whole action. NOT NECESSARY!) So, get this DVD if ur a fan of Oz or you never got a chance to see it from the beginning, because this is truly a great show. Hopefully season 2 and 3 come out too. It's a great show but I think it should have ended after season 3. It just doesn't have the flare it used to.",1012348800,3,869,3.8876404494382024
1675463,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I give this 5 stars only because I can't go any higher!  Anyone who has watched this HBO original series knows that the acting is incredible, the story lines are as true to life as you can get, and is one of the most overall hard-hitting shows ever to come to American TV (albeit cable).  Unfortunately, the show doesn't get the recognition of The Sopranos or Sex in the City because prison dramas don't draw the same overall audience.  You have to see this to believe it!  One of the most requested HBO series finally comes to DVD and I can only hope that HBO releases the other seasons as well.  The best part is, the cast is filled with actors you may not initially recognize, but will later identify in other projects.  Be prepared for a series that doesn't shy away from strong language, adult themes, frontal male nudity, and yes, even prison rape!  AWESOME!",1011830400,38,864,4.5

1675496,1,B00005Y6YJ,Six seasons of life in a maximum-security prison ward? I couldn't take even one episode. Retribution vs. redemption didn't pull it out of the pits.,1502928000,,147,4.92
1675497,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This is the show that put HBO tv on the map. It is the show that took television drama to a whole new level, and as someone else already pointed out, it is the show that proved that a TV show could not only rival film, it proved that a TV series could be the ultimate way of presenting an idea to the masses. Superb doesn't even come close to describing the quality of direction, production, and acting.",1502668800,,403,4.17948717948718
1675498,1,B00005Y6YJ,a lot of BS. There are an abundant number of straight guys in penal systems.,1502236800,,76,4.133333333333334
1675499,1,B00005Y6YJ,"Not realistic at all.

The way prisons work today and the way I would make them work regardless of what the public thinks are night and day. We would have no crime.

Fantasy you say? Watch this series, you will see fantasy.",1502064000,,223,4.285714285714286
1675500,2,B00005Y6YJ,"while I like many of the actors and recognized many of them the writing was horrible to say the least.  It could have been good and had promise but they just couldn't control their political soap boxes.  They make constant political statements and agendas, yet you are supposed to keep in mind this isn't based on reality, and yet the narration is a constant bash of the legal system.
This is pure political propaganda disguised as a series.  It's not well hidden and poorly argued.  Not only is a prisoner able to get a gun, but it happens twice!!!  They are able to use free weights unsupervised and numerous murders go unsolved.  The amount of things they can do unsupervised is mind boggling.  They even put a woman on death row with the male prisoners LOL  It's like a train wreck in it's absurdity, you can't help but look, but after a while you just can't take it anymore.  How this series gets so many high marks makes no sense unless you like to see naked men and gays.",1500508800,,978,4.418994413407821
1675501,4,B00005Y6YJ,I like Prison shows and this is one of the better one.  I am not very big on HBO so I didn't watch this until it was well over.  Its interesting to watch alot of the actors in this now that many of them have become stars in both movies and other tv shows.  The storylines are interesting and sometimes tragic.  Watching Beecher fish out of water tale is one of the more tragic storylines but it is also one of the better ones.,1499472000,,426,4.035714285714286

1675503,1,B00005Y6YJ,Why on earth does this series have a good rating.  It is the worse HBO production ever.  Who in their right mind would think a maximum security prison is a good backdrop for a drama?  It's not even remotely realistic.  Prison is a awful place.  Who wants to spend their time there for entertainment?  Everything about this series is disgusting.,1497139200,,344,4.65

I never did watch it from start to finish, so it is nice to have the ability to watch it straight through at my pace.

1675686,3,B00005Y6YJ,"Having worked in  Close/Max  and Medium custody prisons, this is a unrealistic picture of prison...at least where I worked. No inmates at this level would be permitted to wear personal clothing. I have heard of conjugal visits in liberal bastions such as CA, but most prisons do not allow them. Now, the games convicts and staff play are realistic to a point. (Setting up assaults and taping them is ridiculous. Yet, there are staff and inmates that do live to stir stuff up).",1486166400,,476,4.72289156626506

Then their are the weekly murders inside the prison. Then their is the constant BS made up stats like ""this country executes 1 inmate per week"" maybe in 1886 but not in 1999. Lastly, there is the sob story about how Criminals and murderers are just misunderstood good guys who just were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1676145,5,B00005Y6YJ,"If you want to know what turned television into a genre that rivals the best of anything in film you have to start with the masterpiece HBO series ""OZ.""

Without ""OZ"" there would be no ""The Wire,"" no ""Deadwood,"" no ""Breaking Bad,"" no ""Downton Abbey,"" no extended dramas you could watch for 60 hours without being able to shut them off.

This was the beginning of ""binge watching"" and I am sure that anybody who is into high end television could name 10 more series' that make up their own favorites that completely changed for them what television is all about.

Before ""OZ"" I think most people would agree that ""Lonesome Dove"" was the greatest 6 hours in the history of TV.

Then HBO came at you with the baseball bat called ""OZ.""  I have no idea how they got it even on cable.

Back when I was in my youth it would have been X-Rated.  Even from the standpoint of a jaded viewer like myself the violence and horror can be shocking.  But ""OZ"" paved the way for all those great shows in which people speak to each other as they really speak and in which events unfold in ways that are not hemmed in by convention.

This is the masterpiece that started it all.  Even if there was nothing other than cartoons available on Amazon Prime I would consider that I got my money's worth as a result of being able to revisit the horrific brilliance of ""OZ.""

As I suggested above this is an adults only show and I can imagine it making quite a few adults I know very squeamish as well.  Be forewarned: This great series pulls absolutely no punches and is at least as hard hitting as anything that has followed in its wake.

If you want to see where the renaissance of TV began this is it.  Very highest recommendation and major thanks to Amazon for making it available with all of its original content on Amazon Prime streaming video.  This should be the first thing on your watch list in my humble opinion.",1472256000,4,1896,4.361823361823362

1676267,5,B00005Y6YJ,This show is great! I remember catching some of it back when the series first aired. But I really missed a lot. Amazon prime has made it so easy to catch up. I just set it to auto play and get some popcorn and we're ready to go.  It takes a look into the  correctional facilities in United States. I actually think this is where OITNB got the idea for there show. It has some scenes that aren't for your sensitive viewers or children. But if you aren't in those two groups you will love it. I give it all 5 stars!!! Visit the  emerald city today on Amazon prime.,1463875200,,562,4.090909090909091

1676293,5,B00005Y6YJ,"It's downright gritty.  You will either like or not.  I'm a fan, but my boss who loves gory stuff, couldn't stand the violence.  Since I've never been to prison, I can't say how 'true to life' this is, but trust me, I certainly don't want to go.  It shows allegiances, double crossings, murders and  that's just the guards!  There's much rivalry between the different factions - the Hispanics, the Italians, the blacks, the Muslims, which leaves the few white guys to figure out who they are aligned with or against.

Not for those faint of heart, but it's well done.  Dean Winters (who plays Mr. Mayhem in the Allstate commercials) is excellent.  He's not a big, muscled guy like most of the inmates so he uses his wiles and wit to get what he wants.  His real life brother is also in this.",1462492800,,791,4.468531468531468

I have worked inside several prisons and can say from my experiences this show is entertaining but there are other ""prison"" shows that are closer to reality behind bars. Orange is the new black does a great job of hitting the small details such as the props like the beds and blankets are spot on. The prison issued clothes are also exactly what you see in most prisons.",1454025600,,443,4.481481481481482

It came across like a sad attempt to make a retro 70's B-movie street gang series.  I'd rather watch The Warriors on loop for hours. (I tried watching a bit of Season 5 also.

1676567,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Great show and I am stoked to now be able to watch the entire series on Amazon.
Great writing, complex characters, philosophical narration, surreal visuals and chaotic plot twists that unfold to unpack real social issues as lived by the Oswald or ""Oz"" prison community.  New inmates are introduced each week and subsequently killed off within the space of a few episodes.  If you're a sucker for gritty character driven drama that mines the darker side of the human psyche then you won't be disappointed.",1447891200,,504,4.91764705882353

1676588,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Powerfully written storyline of a white-collar criminal and his incarceration if the Oswald State Pen (fictional).  Despite being more than a decade old, this series continues to be compelling, riveting and deeply dramatic television at its finest!  Over several seasons the characters are complexly developed and portrayed as individuals with backstory, not just hardened criminal inmates lost in the system.  Graphic violence, explicit sexual content and profanity are all used as realistically as one would imagine they are in a similar setting in the real world, so certainly not for the faint of heart or easily offended.",1447200000,,626,5.43298969072165

1676596,3,B00005Y6YJ,"Very dated and over the top. It's a little hard to take the old guy from the State Farm commercials seriously as a gang leader. The show is also loaded with 90's political theories on prison life, solitary confinement, and how far people are willing the go for control. If one can get past all that, it's a good time passer and worth a go through--not something I'd watch twice or miss much.",1447027200,2,391,4.36986301369863

1676612,2,B00005Y6YJ,"I found the first two seasons of OZ packaged together at Walmart for a good price so I bought them. I had previously only seen part of one episode. The whole show is foolishness. The Emerald City with the glass doors and handpicked prisoners is a very bad joke. Anyone can see after watching one season that the whole concept of the City, the so called reform, is a complete and utter absurd JOKE. This would NEVER happen in real life. The whole show just seems to be a platform for gratuitous male nudity, violence and erotic homosexual behavior, and also, throw in a lot of drug usage. Barely one character on the entire show has any real character or honesty. Everyone character in the show is corrupt in some manner. The show has lots of violence, nudity, profanity and yet, it makes me fall asleep simply because the hodgepodge of it all is so utterly stupid. That said, I have season two to watch and I will because I have it and I have already paid for it. This show is stupid and violent like American Horror Story.",1446336000,,1023,4.417989417989418

It is very violent which I am sure is very realistic, but some of the plot lines are far too cliche and predictable.  One thing that I am picking up from the show is, we on the outside have no idea what happens to individuals on the inside. I mean we don't hear about violent assaults or murders in prison on the the 11's clock news. We can't read about it in the paper. So, we have no idea how horrible the conditions are.",1443225600,,569,3.991228070175439

1676701,4,B00005Y6YJ,"A somewhat staggered start to what became a very strongly written and character driven series.

""Oz"" is the nickname for the fictional Oswald State Penitentiary. The series is very much a product of its times, being aired in the late 90's and early 2000's. It has a HUGE string of notable actors: BD Wong from Law & Order SUV, Harold Perrineau from The Matrix: Reloaded and Lost, Edie Falco of Sopranos and Nurse Jackie, JK Simmons from too many things to mention, Lee Tergesen who is in tons of things, eljko Ivanek from True Blood and many other things, JD Williams who played Brodie in The Wire... Much of the casting choices carry over from the ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" series and ""The Wire."" This is likely a casting agency thing, but it is great to see some really great actors in their breaking phase. The casting is amazing and worth it just to see some great actors doing their craft before they got bigger, more notable roles, or just to point out and go, ""oh, where do I know him from...""

Some might complain about the dialog, but this is coming from an era where Def Poetry Jam was still a cultural thing. It's featured in the first episode. The writing varies in measures from casual dialog to stage pacing and even poetic versing. Beat poetry and spoken word performance was more of a thing then than it is now. Some parts are definitely dated, especially technology with the big, clunky CRT monitors (I don't mind though, I love those big, toxic things), but the camera work is still unique and interesting due to practical effects. No Widescreen, though, so you must suffer the outdated 4:3. (deal with it, though, the series is worth it)

The play on Oz from storybooks is only skin deep. The tagline is, ""it's no place like home."" And the start of the series delivers that message home with the travails of Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen). Amidst this is a series of slow-moving plot twists that show the power-struggle elements of the prison system. Some try to overthink the Oz metaphor, but it's best not to. The connection is largely superficial.

What you get is a measured and purposed character driven-drama about prison and all that it entails. Many of the events are true of prison sentenced inmates, especially the racial segregating. Obviously, Oz is a dramatization, but it has that distinct air of authenticity behind its writing staff that also made The Wire such a hit. There is a sense that, while played up for drama, the events aren't too far from the truth. And if you know anything about the American incarceration system, the series isn't too far from the truth at all.

Don't expect to be swept off your feet with amazing camera work or hyper-realistic shaky-cam footage of fights, If you like hard boiled drama, and you have a passing interest in the crazy ins and outs of prison life for people with long sentences, then you will likely enjoy the first season of Oz. It might take a bit to get used to the delivery, but I think it is worth it to catch a glimpse of a vastly underrated series.",1442966400,2,3039,4.589318600368324

1676976,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This is a stellar show, and one that I am surprised didn't last longer.  Although I have never been incarcerated, from what I am told, this is an accurate representation of what prisoners face, although the killing doesn't happen so much. I am going to cover a few aspects of this movie.

ACTING

It was superb.  This is a gritty, dark show.  People in prison are not pretty; they're at different points of human deprivation.  Although most of the fellows in here were handsome, no one had movie-star good looks.  Some of them looked outright normal in their appearance.  Along those lines, the acting followed suit.  These guys are rough, and everyone encapsulated the rough life well.  Most people weren't Shakespearean with the ""thees"" and ""thous,"" yet they all exhibited well the complexity of each character.

A notable standout was the fellow who played Adebisi.  If you look up his resume, the fellow is fluent in five langages, has a law degree, and dresses impeccably.  Yet you would never know that from his portrayal.  The gentleman who played Ryan O'Reilly did a great job, too.  From having challenged vocabulary skills to being a master scammer and schemer, this guy knew what he was doing.

SCENERY

This was a prison.  There is nothing pretty about it.  The walls are dingy.  The cells are restrictive and oppressive.  The entire set-up is one that is committed to ensuring that the basest human behaviors of the prisoners show themselves on a daily basis.  Although Oz was listed as a correctional facility, it was simply a holding place to torture and maim as many people as possible for crimes.

Anyone watching this for the first time should be aware that there is a lot of full-on male nudity from most of the characters.  Some of it involved intercourse between prisoners, but a lot of it was due to fighting and prisoners who simply did not care about what they were wearing, if anything.  If you have religious sensibilities or are squeamish about nudity, this would not be the show for you.  If, however, you can appreciate it as a natural part of prison life, a life in which people have all their rights taken from them, you'll see that it's less about seeing people's unadorned body and more about showing human depravity.

I would recommend anyone to see the film.  You'll really start to align yourself with the character of your choice, and you start rooting for him or her from start to finish.  Caveat:  It's likely that the character that you become attached to will die at some point in the series, and often suddenly.",1440460800,7,2553,4.723356009070295
1676977,5,B00005Y6YJ,This is the second time I've watched this series and it's just as entertaining as the first time. Highly recommend!,1440460800,,115,4.8

Sure, there is a lot of nudity, sex, language, violence, etc....but it's set in a PRISON.  If you didn't expect this....you are a wee bit light in the head!

I am on Season 4 or 5 now and am still watching.  It's not one that I can't wait to rush home and watch or lose sleep over but it's worth watching.  It doesn't quite have the ""Orange is the New Black"" draw but it is still good.",1440374400,,652,4.078740157480315

There's a variety of scenarios dealing with race, drugs, and scheming to keep your wondering what's next. The acting is decent with several actors we've seen in other series and commercials. It shows you the insides of a test section of a prison called Oswalt, with the intent to help prisoners succeed in their rehab. OZ is the yellow brick road to not make a return to prison.

1678378,4,B00005Y6YJ,"This is a pretty solid show, better than I expected. I thought this show would probably be all about cruelty-porn: showing people in a brutal situation for the purposes of shock and titillation. I also thought it might be dedicated to the nice-white-guy trope, since the man who runs the unit the show focuses on, McManus, is an idealistic white man. But this idea is nicely complicated by the characters of Warden Glynn and Kareem Said, both intelligent and powerful black men who have their own (very different) ideas about how things should be run, and by the fact that McManus so often fails at his goals because admitting the power of larger systemic ills to himself is so difficult.

The show is surprisingly political, genuinely addressing some of the most intractable problems with the way prisons and the legal system operate in the US. Sometimes it can get a bit strident, and in 2015, the narration gimmick has pretty much been murdered by Zach Braff, so the narrations that outline the theme of each episode can get tiresome. But the show is full of excellent actors, many of whom are still very relevant today. And for its time, it's a rare opportunity to see so many outstanding actors of color all at once in a drama. It's kept me watching, and I'm a tough sell.",1432944000,2,1277,4.650442477876106

1678385,4,B00005Y6YJ,This episode and episode 4 are hard to watch. Not that I expect the writers to make the characters and situation unbelievable but it would be somewhat comforting to know that Jefferson's effort at changing his life was successful. When he broke down and accepted Said's faith it was heartfelt but just as in reality circumstances and bad luck makes it impossible for a brother to keep on the straight and narrow.

I never had any issues with the inmates, however, I watched other supervisors look down on inmates.  I would tell them; There but for the Grace of God go I.  Oz did an amazing job of depicting what life can be like in jail.  I saw inmates leave, only to return shortly after...in jail they got three meals a day and a bed to sleep on.  Some inmates, well, the deck was just stacked against them.  There were evil people and decent people who made bad choices.  There was corruption and there was hope.",1428105600,,636,4.241666666666666

1678858,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I couldn't find this first season  in the local library so I was happy to find this free through my Amazon Prime account.  This is the first television series offered by HBO in the late nineties and it focuses on a group of inmates in a special prison facility called OZ which stands for The Oswald Correctional Facility.  The prisoners are allowed to dress in their own clothes, do their own laundry and work at jobs in the prison's kitchens, library, administrative offices or hospital, so you don't get the claustrophobic feeling of many prison stories.  Prisoners wander somewhat casually around the prison ward interacting with each other,  forming cabals and warring groups.  It was filmed.in New York drawing from the bevy of New York character actors of many ethnic backgrounds that live there.  Alhough the cast changes as characters are murdered or moved out of sight when they act up and are thrown into solitary,  a core group remains and stories spin off from them.  The first season consists of eight one hour episodes but this was quickly expanded to 16 episodes starting in the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons as the popularilty of the series grew.",1426550400,,1164,4.838383838383838

This is the show that started it all. The cast is stellar! There are so many recognizable stars who got their start at Oswald State Penetentiary and are now on to other amazing things....Christopher Meloni (L&O SVU), BD Wong (L&O SVU), Dean Winters (Battle Creek), LL Cool J (NCIS LA), JK Simmons (The Closer, Juno, Whiplash), Harold Perrineau (Lost), Edie Falco (The Sopranos, Nurse Jackie).  And I musn't forget, Hollywood royalty Rita Moreno (West Side Story). Oz's cast reads as a who's who of TV and film.  And the guest stars...people from all over clamored to guest star on this show!

I knew about it back when it first came out, but I was unsure of what type of show it was as I didn't get the chance to watch it due to growing up without HBO as a channel.  After watching the first season, I must say, I'm very shocked at how well written and executed the shows have been thus far.  I do have the rest of the series to watch, but, from what I've seen so far, I'm engrossed into the characters and what's going to happen next.  Each episode you watch leaves to begging for more and you want to finish the season as quickly as possible to find if any of the characters will find resolution if they haven't died earlier.  This season is a must watch for any fan of the Law & Order shows as this has many actors from that series, plus, there are some clever ideas and whatnot as to how the prisoners smuggle their drugs and shape weapons, etc.  I believe, if you start watching this show, you'll be hooked.",1424390400,,1029,4.0945273631840795

1679850,5,B00005Y6YJ,"AMAZING!!! I first saw this show on HBO in the middle of Season 2 or 3 and was immediately hooked. Although the death sentences play out as though the appeals process had yet to be invented, this show is top-notch. It's twisted, sick, violent, brutal...and compelling. The acting and writing is outstanding. If you are easily offended, then this show is NOT for you. The subtext and character interplay is overt, yet subtle. If one is willing to see past the brutality and into the heart of the story, then it is definitely an enjoyable experience.",1420416000,,548,4.71875

It is brutal and violent and yet they manage to keep you seeing the inmates as humans with feelings.  Not for the squeamish or sensitive.  This series is one of the best ever  and incorporates so many stars  part of the fun of watching is seeing who is in it  A MUST see series for anyone who who is sick of the CRAP the have on regular TV  and wants something with NO CGI and some REALLY story telling and acting  10 stars if I could,1420416000,,582,4.070796460176991

I own the entire series and highly recommend it.  The only warning I'd give people is that it's very violent and there are more than a few disturbing things shown.

1680756,2,B00005Y6YJ,"Grade B at best TV Series. Poor, low quality production. The series is design to give the viewer a sense of being in the prison as if this was live footage, it is all stage and the poor production values (small, grainy, 640x480 resolution) appears to have been shot on a low end home hand camera. It has a very poor ""story line,"" if it can be called a story line. I was expecting an interesting story about a special, almost SyFy, experimental area in a prison to reform prisoners, wow was I disappointed. The series is like watching a Drill Sargent barking orders at prisoners (nothing unusual or interesting there) and a Psychiatrist talking to patients talking about their problems (very boring). After 30 grueling minutes I had to turn the pilot episode off. I can't see how this show even made it on air.",1412899200,,809,4.5479452054794525

1680876,5,B00005Y6YJ,"A good series that has many familiar faces that you still see on regular TV. The cast does have a core set of players, but you are never sure who may die in the program, which makes it interesting. You have mixed feelings for the characters, as they are all trapped in one way or another be it physically or mentally. You see all aspects of the human experience, often reiterated by the convict in the wheelchair. If all the political correctness of society was to be  stripped away, I think that this is what we would all end up of being like- trusting only our ""group"", and not really trusting them either. It provokes thought into what our society creates, how we respond by punishment, and what we eventually will have released back into society.",1411344000,,750,4.514705882352941

1681560,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I watched this series when it first came out in the 90s.  As usual HBO produced another raw series that kept the viewer quite engaged.  The subject matter was a mix of the harsh life one leads in prison with a human aspect thrown in for character development so you can go on a ride of hating one character one series and then feeling sorry for them the next.  Or in some cases hoping a character gets what they deserve once and for all.  This series was a good example of the light and dark sides of humans in the most dire of situations after committing a heinous crime that landed them in Oz.  It's up to the viewer to determine who is ""good"" and who is ""bad.""  Most people would watch this show and determine they are all prisoners and low lives that have no good qualities and only the staff that run the facility are ""good.""  Eventually one finds out that is not even true.  If you like drama, criminal shows, dark themes, and a glimmer of hope in a hopeless world you may really like this series.  If the first season grabs you don't be surprised watching all the way through to Season 6.  If this show is not your cup of tea you will know within the first 10 minutes of the first episode of season 1.  I tend to like darker themes at times so this show kept my attention all six seasons.",1407196800,,1295,4.181451612903226

Everything about it seems very disjointed and unrealistic - from the dress, the lack of punishment, the priveleges the inmates get and the level of violence which doesn't seem to affect any of the living circumstances for more than a few days.

At the same time, the show seems to move at a herky-jerky pace. A lot of the action seems to take place at the end of the episode (again, I only watched 3) while the rest of the episode never really engaged me. Of course, most of the characters are terrible human beings. But even the ones who I would be inclined to like just come across as idiots.

There were bright spots that made me think and I liked the novel idea of having a character in a wheel chair speak to the audience in first person but even that got tiresome when he started to spin around like he was in a washing machine.",1406592000,,945,4.273743016759776

There is a large cast and all the cons have at least two if not three names they go by which, at least for me, made it hard to really track things in the beginning. (They have their legal name ""John Doe"" then their .... ""Con Name""?? aka ""Spider""?? and sometimes a nick name aka ""John, John or Doe Boy"" etc).

I will admit that largely due to this issue of knowing who is who and a subtle plot line thur the season I wasn't really ""Sucked In"" very fast, but it's HBO ... And they have a great Rep for making good stuff .... So I stuck with it longer than I might have anything else. That, and the fact the ""Season"" is only 8 episodes long, meant I wasn't really fully vested by the end of season one. Still being HBO and showing promise of something I might enjoy I kept watching.

I'm glad I did. Like some kinds of spicy foods that start off mild and slowly build bite by bite until your mouth is on fire at the end, Oz starts slow and ramps up in intensity to be quite a ride..... You just got to stick with it long enough to make it pay.

I would recommend it if you liked shows like HBO's ""The Wire"", ""The Sopranos"" or Netflix's ""Orange is the New Black"", as they share similar lenses of the occasional piece of comedic relief paired with the gritty grim drama that is a reality of the situation these characters find themselves in.

HBO was one of the non network pioneers that started creating their own content giving them the freedom to be more hard hitting, gritty and real.

That being said I truly enjoyed the series. There are twists and turns in the plot you won't expect. Nobody is safe from harm. There are a lot of famous guest appearances. It is also interesting to see what some of the actors are doing today.  I never expected Vern Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) and Ryan O'Reily (Dean Winters) be selling insurance, Tobias Beecher's (Lee Tergesen) romantic involvement with Bree on Desperate Housewives, or Chris Keller (Christopher Meloni) solving crimes on Law and Order just to name a few.",1405036800,,663,4.807017543859649

1681885,3,B00005Y6YJ,"So glad that Amazon has gotten the HBO shows for streaming! I never finished this series, and it is very interesting coming back to it. Oz is dated, preachy, and the chorus moments sometimes come across as hollow and forced. But Oz was the beginning of so many shows. There are great performances, and the prison itself is a character. I think it is well worth a re-watch, if only to see the arc of HBO shows, and actors that we see again in the Wire and on Law and Order.",1404950400,,472,4.197802197802198

1681891,5,B00005Y6YJ,"What a great series, didn't know that much about this show.  To me there wasn't as much attention given to this show as The Wire or the Sopranos so I didn't hear about this.  I already have HBO and was meaning to get around to watching this.  When it came to Prime I thought I'd give it a chance and watch.  I'm glad I did and it did not disappoint.  I was also surprised by the amount of actors that are in OZ, that later appear in The Wire and other HBO shows.  It was funny watching Carver and Daniels from The Wire appear in OZ first (they have to make their bones somewhere first).  OZ is a great show, gritty, raw, and as close to prison life than I've seen on other shows.  Give this show a chance, you will not be disappointed",1404777600,,734,4.048611111111111

season, on VHS, at a Dollar General. A DOLLAR GENERAL!!! Next to a box set of ""SEX and THE CITY"". Shortly after buying season 1, DVD's were just starting to come out. Over time, I slowly built up my DVD library. But I never was able to find the first season. So you can imagine when I came across the first season I yelled out HELL YEAH!!!

 If you enjoy a very dark, and a little controversial drama, then this is for you. This is by far, the best prison drama I have ever seen. Drugs, sex, murder, rape, internal corruption, sometimes just plain disgusting, with everything you could almost imagine in a
maximum security prison is in this series.

1682188,3,B00005Y6YJ,"This show was a big deal when it came out- and I get why.  From the murder to the (worse), the show pulls no punches.  It tells small stories well, and seems to know what its characters are all about.  It's a competent show.  But it's just not as cutting edge nowadays, and the wear of time is starting to show.  The really unusual stuff like a man describing being in prison in the middle of a sealed, transparent, spinning box just seems pointlessly elaborate now.  And what is the overall story that's being told?  I'm not quite sure.

Oz seems like a show of good sub-plots that were poorly united with a fairly weak overall narrative, punctuated with some really gritty moments that are more memorable than the actual show itself.",1403481600,,735,4.515151515151516

Some are federal cars, some are state cases but somehow everyone ends up here in Oz.  But if you try not to over think it, you might be entertained.  Very adult themes do not for those under 18.

1682338,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Never would have watched Oz if it were not for amazon Prime. When the show was on the air it didn't sound appealing; a series about prisoners in max security? Definitely not a subject that would draw my attention.
Breaking Bad is another example of a show that I would never have chosen to watch if it were not for having a Roku. Loved it too.

The writing is amazing. Every6 character has his own foilbles, distinctive voice and interesting backstory. In regards to the latter, the writers were able to show the reason each prisoner, or CO, was in Oz... in the matter of a few seconds.
In some instances the viewer gets to know the character -before- knowing their full story. This throws a wonderful hitch into what you thought you knew.

The episodes are ewach directed in a different style. Check out the Director credit for each one. I was stunned into saying 'Cool' out loud every time. Different directors bring a freshness to every scene, as compared to a prior week's show.
You can't help but feel the sorrow, loss, pain, and hate that these characters embody.
You won't be able to keep from cringing at the horror, unfairness, and cruelty that these men, and a few women (including Edie Falco from The Sopranos and Rita Moreno from countess films of the 40's, 50's and 60's) are subjected to.

I've seen a few idiots whine about the foul language. Hey, this is a show about PRISON life. Are you serious? Did you think that every darned emotion or outburst would cause a person to say 'Oh fudge!'?

Oz seems true to life, is written to a paramount standard, and the characters are three dimensional and unforgettable.

Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1402704000,2,1668,4.602693602693603

1682388,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Oz shows the hard (television version) of reality of prison life.  Having had no previous experience with the situation, I cannot attest to its authenticity.  I will say that I've watched the series twice and would gladly watch it again.

Season One sets up life in Oz - Oswald Maximum Security Correctional Facility.  The staff is made up of a cross section of American life.  There are the bleeding heart liberals in Tim McManus (Terry Kenney), Father Ray Mukada (BD Wong [Law & Order: SVU]) and the previously married but now widowed, Sister Pete (Rita Moreno [Singing in the Rain and The King and I]).  On the other side of the coin are the ""Ya done wrong now suck it up"" folks in the guise of Warden Leo Glenn (Ernie Hudson [Ghostbusters]), Officer Dianne Whittlesey (Edie Falco [Sopranos]), Officer Joe Mineo (Phillip Scozzarella), and Governor James Devlin (Zeljko Ivanek [24 and Homicide: Life on the Street]).

A variety of bad guys float in and out of Oz.  However, the bulk of the actors are in most of the episodes.  Augustus Hill, a thief who was injured in commission of a crime and became paralyzed (Harold Perrineau [Blade, TV series, Lost, Matrix franchise]), Aryan Vern Schillinger (J.K. Simmons [State Farm ads]), Poet (Craig muMs Grant), Ryan O'Reily (Dean Winters [Homicide: Life on the Street, Law & Order: SVU]), African druggie pseudo warlord Simon Adebisi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje [Congo and Bourne Identity]).

The facility is supposed to house some of the area's worst criminals.  As such, tensions between inmates, especially ethnic groups, always remain high.  One thing for sure, Oz never fails to shock.  It was a darn good series.",1402444800,,1663,4.96028880866426
1682389,5,B00005Y6YJ,I like this series a lot & would recommend it to people who want to know what prison is like.  It doesn't pull any punches so if you are ready to see what happens in prison don't watch it.,1402444800,,188,3.8205128205128207

For some reason the swearing and screaming, bloodshed and penis shots became a huge turn off because any tiny thread of a story had vanished by then. None of these characters are worth rooting for. I was never captivated or drawn in by any of their plights. Everyone deserved exactly where they were. They all played their parts as the butt end of humanity to a T. If this is prison life then I will be sure to end mine before I ever see those gates. If they would have shut this down at the end of the second season that would have been enough of this environment in my head.
One other thing that really grated in seasons 4 and 5 was the ""music"" that was used to delineate scenes. It was the same few chords over and over and over. Some decent music would have done a lot to improve the ""rubbed the wrong way"" feeling.",1402272000,,873,4.2023809523809526

1682463,3,B00005Y6YJ,...just watch it and judge for yourself.  I was looking for something more real without the sensorship.  showing the actual rappes of prisoners and such but then I'm reminded these men are actors not actual prisoners.,1402099200,,217,5.0
1682464,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Oz is fantastic in so many ways... I could go on and on about this show. I've convinced a lot of my friends to check it out, and everyone that has has ended up watching the entire series through. And really, it's not until you've watched multiple seasons that you start to fully appreciate just how well done this show is. Throughout the series, you never once see the outside of the prison, aside from in flashbacks, which really helps to make you feel like you're trapped in there yourself. There are also no characters that are immune from harm. Unlike most shows, Oz won't hesitate to kill off a major character half-way through the series. No one is safe. And very few of the characters are static - you actually get to see the ways in which their experiences shape who they are and will be. They work in a some social commentary too (primarily in regard to the way incarceration is handled in America), but they do so in such a way that it doesn't at all detract from the story.
Oz really is one of the best television dramas, and I would argue THE best prison series.

Make no mistake though, this show is brutal, and full of misery. For the most part, there are no happy endings.
And for those of you with more delicate sensibilities, there is drug use, there is nudity, there is rape, there is torture, and there is death. And of course there's quite a bit of swearing too. These things are very much a part of the American prison system, and Oz would have been remiss to omit them.

Riddled with violence as to be expected from a show depicting the male prison system, the show seemingly captures the experience of prison quite well. The show does a decent job developing character stories, giving you the opportunity to understand each player in the plot and even feel empathetic towards some. The underlying moral conflicts are pretty surface, not really diving to far into the real issues you begin to see via race relations, violence/aggression, and masculinity. Overall, an entertaining show with an interesting narrator perspective. I would definitely recommend for anyone interested in dark humor and violent themes.",1401321600,,702,5.390909090909091

1682712,1,B00005Y6YJ,"In the most intellectually DISHONEST portrayal of Islam, this mysogynistic, supremacist culture and religion is portrayed as the only real 'turn the other cheek, anti-drug anti-violence movement in the prison. IN TRUTH, the lure of Islam in prisons is in the ability to treat women like property, (female genital mutilation is also common),  beating your own and raping of non-Muslim women both please Allah. As a Muslim, the Jew, Christian and Hindu are all beneath you, and in a Muslim society they cannot have equal rights with a Muslim. To lie or kill for Islam is perfectly acceptable, and to die in furthering Islam is the best way to die. In Islam, you are at peace only with other Muslims, and at a state of (often-times undeclared)  war with all others.

This uncivilized violence that is Islam is completely portrayed as a hip, non-violent thing, and that is COWARDICE by the series' creators, and an INSULT TO TRUTH. See the DVD ""What the West Needs to Know About Islam"", or go to Pam Geller's or Richard Spencer's websites to see what the Koran truly says.",1401148800,8,1068,4.762162162162162

It is always gut wrenching, brutal, and very realistic. The setting seems very appropriate and it is wonderful to see leading men that aren't your typical heart throb types. The characters are well developed and very human. Despite their crimes, some of which are incredibly vicious, you will come to care about them. The plot revolves around a group of prisoners and prison staff that are very much products of their environment. Upbringing, race, life choices, bad luck, social status, mental illness, anger, frustration, hopelessness.. all affect who these men have become. Full nudity, homosexual encounters, graphic violence and profanity... and it is all absolutely appropriate for this show. If that bothers you, I wouldn't recommend watching. If you want something fast paced, gripping, intense, and extremely well executed.. you will love it. The one thing that bothers me is the narrator character. Great actor, but the weird camera angles and spinning prison cell seem like an attempt to be too artsy and clever. The story itself is enough for me.",1363737600,6,1202,5.101522842639594

If this doesn't scare you away from a life of crime, NOTHING will! There's nothing glamorous about life in Prison, in this case Oz. In fact it's your very worst nightmare! Your days and nights are spent wondering how you can, or if you can, survive until the next day. It's the very act of survival that can turn a criminal into an even ""better"" one, or take a basically decent person whose committed a tragic mistake, and turn him into an animal.
There's a lot of very graphic violence and the full on nudity helps to show how the inmates are figuratively and literally stripped of their dignity! This is a very addictive series, and is so well acted and produced, that at times you almost feel like you're watching a documentary.

Watching men brutalize each other for hour upon hour seems an implausible way to pass the time. I watched the 1st season and learned nothing from it other than that those in prison, or who make films about prison, enjoy romanticizing life behind bars when it is simply a bunch of damned savages behind bars. None of the characters seem to have any motivation or any goals in mind other than to commit mayhem. The fact that the protagonist in the first episode winds up being half beaten to death and then having lighter fluid set aflame on him while recuperating is about as dramatic as watching grass grow. Mindless useless violence. I threw the discs in the garbage. To make matters worse these episodes have an aged quality about them, as if the episodes were shot forty years ago. The quality of film is far from crisp. A big bore and glad I didn't purchase a boxed set, assuming it is available. Now on to The Wire to see if it's any better.",1299196800,5,1117,4.5073891625615765

1683327,5,B00005Y6YJ,"If you've never 'done time', and think you know what prison is all about, think again. You can be sure,'OZ' WILL make you stop and think. And if you have doubts that a show about the daily grind in the big house would be very interesting, that opinion will be changed 10 minutes into the first episode.

The Good:
'OZ' is set as an East Coast penitentiary, and does a remarkable job of recreating the environment one finds in prison. The cast is truly first rate; characters from other films and shows make appearances in 'OZ' that demonstrate their versatility and talent in ways that will shock you. There are some who you find yourself hating at a visceral level; others will make your heart sick for the damage inflicted on their humanity. Because the show spares no aspect of prison life, you'll see a grade of brutality that, while the norm for inmates, the common man on the street seldom encounters. There are no punches pulled with 'OZ'. Male nudity & rape, homosexual encounters, drug use, and sociopathic manipulation are all just around the next corner. The show also gives you a view into the power struggles of not only the inmates, but the politicians, prison staff, and guards. Each character has their own personal victories and defeats. Just as any good show marks it's success by how much the viewer 'cares' about seeing what happens next, the creators of 'OZ' have a real winner here.

The Bad:
The one aspect of prison life that 'OZ' is weak at conveying is the utter boredom that one encounters when locked away. The show is a drama, not a documentary, so this can be overlooked. Another aggravating issue is the tendency for the show to skip ahead in large (and unexplained) blocks of time; e.g. one scene will end, and the next is supposed to be two months later. The last noteworthy complaint is again related to this being a drama and not reality: the quantity of violence is a bit much at times. While the savagery of prison violence is accurate enough, the sheer number of killings alone is a bit absurd. This is annoying because it will leave most viewers firmly convinced that prison has a 20% mortality rate, which is simply not true.

Corruption and redemption mark the sides of the pendulum upon which 'OZ' swings. When a show lasts for 6 seasons, and ends by design (rather than cancellation) is telling of it's quality. 'OZ' does not go stale. You will want the entire series ready at hand, because when one episode ends, you won't want to wait for the next.",1268265600,4,2493,4.61036036036036
1683328,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I'm a netflix user and netflix suggested that I would LOVE this series. So without ever watching it, I just went ahead and bought the entire series. It was a GREAT decision. Oz predates the Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, and many more that follow its format, but Oz is clearly the original and THE BEST. The storyline can feel a little jumpy because there's always so much going on, but it's completely engrossing. When I got all six seasons, I finished them in less than two weeks.

There are no cameras anywhere in the prison apparently; the inmates are allowed to basically supervise themselves (no officers are watching them anywhere apparently except the two in the block); inmates run the kitchen & prepare all the food completely unsupervised; they wear regular clothes and hang out in groups in each others GLASS cells; inmates are beaten, maimed, raped, and do drugs and the prison staff act as if this is completely normal and acceptable behavior. The list could just go on... I admit, I watched the first season on DVD at first out of curiosity, then it was like a train wreck to see what happened next.

1683390,1,B00005Y6YJ,"Do NOT believe the hype and the 5-star reviews that this show is getting - trust me. Some (but not all) of the reasons I ""sentenced"" this show to a 1-star rating are mentioned below:

OUTDATED: This show is seriously outdated. Compared to ""The Wire"" which should hold up for at least 10 years, this show just seemed very ancient and not relevant to today at all.

STORYLINES: This is HBO, so you know this show is going to be extremely politically correct and left-wing. But come on HBO and OZ writers, do you have to be so blatant about it? As for the specific storylines, there were so many flaws that I won't waste your are my time dissecting each episode. Besides, the stories were so boring and unbelievable anyways, that it's not even worth discussing. If you know anything about prison (which I'm not saying I do) or have watched tv specials/documentaries about a real prison you'll know that this show is full of ""you know what"" and the premise would never hold-up.

SETTING: The setting for this show was absolutely horrible. The jail setting(s) were completely fabricated on a bad film stage and just made the show visually boring. I mean the producers couldn't chalk up some more money to have a `yard' scene or more realistic shots!? The lighting was too bright and everything was closed in too tight - but not in a good and intentional way.

CAST OF CHARACTERS: What were the casting directors and producers thinking? I mean Edie Falco as a tough security guard. A washed-up Ernie Hudson as the warden? Quite laughable. And the rest of the stereotypical cast of characters - were insanely unbelievable and just awful actors. All of them were extremely cheesy and seemed like they should be on a Sesame Street show depicting prison. Seriously.

OZ was supposed to be extremely cutting-edge and very gritty when it came out? The water-cooler talk parts (the few fight scenes, gay rape, etc.) were not a big deal at all and in fact were watered down and unmemorable.
Finally, what was with having the narrator spewing his words of wisdom to the viewer in some sort of spinning contraption? Not only was this technique not needed but it was quite cheesy. As for the show being gritty? - nah, this show is nothing but a lamb chop.",1212364800,14,2238,4.6272040302267
1683391,4,B00005Y6YJ,"Oz Season 1 was the first ""season"" of a tv show I ever owned.

1683392,3,B00005Y6YJ,I had heard a lot of good reviews about this show from various people over the years. I have to say I was very disappointed. The story lines aren't very engaging.

1683393,2,B00005Y6YJ,"In the past I avoided the HBO channel, its movies and shows because of their consistent anti-Americanism and hard-left bias.  But ""The Sopranos"" lulled me into a false sense of security, so I decided to rent ""Oz"" because it looked interesting and because I like Ernie Hudson.  However, instead of a hard-hitting, character-driven prison drama, too often I got issue-driven speechifying and a post-modern politically-correct guy in a wheelchair inside a spinning glass cube.

Here's an example from episode 4, titled ""Capital P,"" that deals with Jefferson Keane's execution.  First this gem between the pro-death penalty governor and a reporter:

Governor: ""The people want the death penalty...They need a sign that something's being done.""

Reporter: ""Even if it's been proven that capital punishment has no effect on crime?""

Governor: ""Especially if has no effect.  These days murders are random, senseless.  Maybe the punishment should be too.""

To call the above exchange a straw man argument wouldn't do justice to scarecrows.  That has got to be the stupidest, most ridiculous lie a liberal has ever come up with on this issue.

""Capital P"" has many other idiocies besides the almost perfect one described above.  For example, the wheelchair guy claims that the state is going to ""put down [Keane] like a rabid dog."" How many rabid dogs get automatic death penalty appeals? Also, since when can a prisoner in general population (or even ""Emerald City"") waltz into death row (which amazingly, also happens to be the protective custody unit -- what luck!), chat with the condemned prisoner, then waltz out again?

What hurts most is that some of stories are really good.  When the show doesn't flaunt its cultural liberalism, the characters are outstanding.  But I just can't take the B.S.",1196294400,15,1793,5.13103448275862

Before The Sopranos, Rome, Deadwood, or The Shield there was Oz, a show which proved that cable could create viable, original programming of a graphically adult nature. Following the subplots of various inmates, one isn't expected to love these people. They are horrid, vile individuals. But they are human. There is Beecher, the lawyer who drove drunk and killed a girl landing him on the inside for vehicular manslaughter. You can only watch as he gradually falls apart under the stress of prison life only to gradually find himself anew as a bizarre, near insane lunatic who everyone comes to fear. There's Ryan O'Reily, manipulating every faction in order to further his own interests even if that means others have to die for actions he is culpable for. There is McManus, one of the prison's officials who hopes to create programs in order to rehabilitate inmates in order to prevent them from reoffending.

1683416,5,B00005Y6YJ,"After seeing some raw violence and sex scenes in movies and cutting edge shows, this series is not as shocking as it once was.  What is truly shocking is the twisted motives of some characters.  Some characters like Arayan leader Schillenger are motivated by power.  He needs his slaves to prove his authoritarian position.  Many of the prisoners plot to control the drug trade, gain power, or just survive the onslaught of predators.  The narrator scenes take us outside the drama and reminds us that this is just a show.  However man's worst desires are shown and we know that such people exist.  We get to know the characters and care what happens to them.  This is not just about life and death, but about redemption and morality.  A few struggle to keep their morals yet must break them in order to survive.  If we know that they are doing acts that are repulsive to them, can we judge them and say that you can never harm others in order to save yourself.

1683419,4,B00005Y6YJ,"The Wire may be the best show to ever hit HBO (or any network, for that matter), but it wasn't the network's first gritty, violent hour-long drama to examine the relationship between individuals and institutions.  Back in the late 1990's there was Oz, a fierce, operatic prison drama that helped pave the way for The Sopranos, The Shield, The Wire, and a whole slew of other shows that once would've been considered too challenging for TV.  In many ways, Oz is a soap opera made for and by guys along the lines of The Sopranos and Rescue Me, but with deep layers of highly relevant social commentary to accompany its explosive (if at times  not too plausible) theatrics.  This was HBO's first hour-long drama, and as such the production values and direction aren't quite up to the standards set by some of the channel's later shows, but thankfully the writing and characterization set the bar much higher.  And if you're watching this show, chances are that's your main concern anyway.

The heart of Oz lies in Emerald City, an experimental unit of Oswald Maximum-Security Penitentiary (hence the show's name) designed to prepare inmates for life on the outside, or at least improve their lives on the inside.  Emerald City is run by unit administrator Tim McManus (memorably played by Terry Kinney), a well-meaning, educated liberal who tries to combat his own demons while injecting some civilization into the general atavism that surrounds him.  Along with tough-minded warden Leo Glynn (the always reliable Ernie Hudson), and a determined prison chaplain (B.D. Wong) and psychologist/drug counselor/nun (Rita Moreno), McManus is charged with keeping the powder keg he presides over from exploding, a job made even more difficult by the meddling of an imperious Republican governor who wants to eliminate what few vestiges of freedom the inmates do enjoy.

Of course, Oz being a prison show, it's the interactions and infighting among the prisoners that's going to provide the main attraction, and it doesn't disappoint in this regard.  If this show is any indication, the guys who warned against factions in the Federalist Papers were dead-on.  Emerald City is a hotbed of rampaging tensions and Machiavellian maneuverings, with frequent beatings and murders thrown in for good measure, among exactly the types of groups you'd expect to find in a prison wing-the gangstas (led by the cartoonishly vicious and menacing Simon Adebisi); the Mafia crew of shrewd capo Nino Schiabetta; the Nazis, with cruel hate machine Vern Schillinger in charge; and the looming wild card of the Muslims, whom celebrity activist and prison newcomer Kareem Said quickly organizes in his ongoing quest to overturn the American system that he despises.  Throw in a few free agents (cocky Irish rogue Ryan O'Reilly; frightened ex-lawyer Tobias Beecher; cold-blooded biker Scott Ross; psycho killer Donald Groves) to shake things up, and all the elements are in place for a pressure-cooker atmosphere unlike anything else on TV.  The characters cover a pretty broad range--some deeply flawed but at least a little sympathetic (Schiabetta, Latino gangster Miguel Alvarez); some enjoyably twisted (O'Reilly, Schillinger); some so evil they scarcely qualify as human (Adebisi and Ross); some just plain crazy (Groves), but all have their distinct personalities.  Even McManus and Said, who at least initially appear to be the most principled of the main characters, are prone to bouts of nearly insufferable self-righteousness and moralism.  The acting is almost uniformly top-notch throughout, which helps drive home the complexity and moral ambiguity of the writing even further.

With the exception of the flashbacks to the crimes that landed its various prisoners in Oz in the first place, the camera rarely leaves the prison and never goes outside, which only serves to emphasize the claustrophobic effect of its environment.  Most of the episodes have some sort of common theme running through them, be it love and sex, capital punishment, drug use, or death and dying, all accompanied by the philosophical, poetic narration  of inmate and recovered crack addict Augustus Hill.  Any show that  has a wheelchair-bound cop killer providing commentary on each episode is bound to be offputting to some, but it's just such risks that make Oz so compelling to watch.  Ultimately, Oz is about lives lived on the edge, whether among the prisoners or the staff, and it doesn't soft-pedal the results of making the wrong decisions, but it's not afraid to bring out the humanity of even its most demented characters (well, most of them anyway).

After a mediocre first episode hampered by its excessive focus on cliched mafia type Dino Ortolani (whose exit is the most memorable thing about him), Oz shifts quickly into overdrive and doesn't stop, culminating in the brutal riot that brings the season to an end and sets the stage for the events to follow in season two.  The show has so many plots and characters that some are bound to feel underdeveloped in an eight-hour season, with some characters seemingly going through a whole series worth of plot lines over the course of a few episodes.  That said, even if the plot development on Oz can occasionally feel a bit fragmentary and hard to believe, its sheer kinetic energy is more than enough to cover up any rough spots.  And there are even better developments to come in season two, so anyone who sees promise in this season is highly encouraged to keep watching.",1170547200,6,5495,5.078888888888889

1683454,5,B00005Y6YJ,"That is a quote from the Spike Lee movie 'Clockers,' but it perfectly sums up the overarching theme behind 'Oz.' Many of the men in HBO's greatest series ('nuff respect to the Sopranos), quite simply, LOVE jail. They aren't getting out anytime soon, and they have nothing else to live for.

So when you shut them all in a room and shake it up, to paraphrase the Amazon review, expect bad things to happen. This is truly the most brutal TV series you will ever watch, and was exceedingly violent, even compared to what you see on channels like F/X and Spike today.

That said, it is a tremendous study in interaction between men who have been pushed to -- and often beyond -- their limits. There is certainly an element of unbelievability about how freely the prisoners seem to move around, how often they find themselves alone, and the rampant corruption among the hacks (prison guards), but hey, it's a TV show. Just think of it as the worst prison in America. It's never explicitly stated WHERE Oswald Correctional Facility is, but given Levinson and Fontana's background on 'Homicide,' and the appearance of 'Homicide' DA Ed Danvers as the Narcissistic Rat-King, Gov. James Devlin makes me think it's supposed to be in Maryland.

Regardless of the setting, the show is tremendous. This first season is a great introduction to the sprawling cast of characters, setting up their allegiances and friendships that will continue to shift over the course of the series.

Standout performances include Lee Tergesen as one of the few inmates who doesn't love jail, Toby Beecher, who undergoes the most dramatic transformation of any prisoner over the first two years, Eamonn Walker as haunted Muslim leader Kareem Said and Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje as Simon Adebisi, the most amoral man to walk the earth and the series' most compelling villain. His smooth, peaceful-sounding accent sounds all the more dangerous and disturbing when you hear the things he says and watch the things he does.

DO NOT watch this with your kids or parents. It is bloody, brutal, sadistic, and contains a lot of full-frontal male nudity. If you can handle that, however, it is an extraordinarily satisfying experience, if a bit unnerving.",1159401600,4,2211,4.916890080428955
1683455,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This DVD edition of OZ, THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, complete with cast biographies and deleted scenes, is proof once again that HBO is on the cutting edge of TV drama and often is so much better than anything that you will see in your local theatre. Oz is the short name for Oswald Maximum Security Prison where in one section of it, Emerald City, Tim McManus (Terry Kinney) attempts, often with little if any success, to rehabilitate prisoners rather than just house them.

We certainly are not in Kansas here although there is no yellow brick road either. The film is graphic, brutal and intense. There are rapes, drug deals, racial tension, murders and suicides and guard misconduct; but there is also a decent Asian Catholic priest as well as a nun social worker (Rita Moreno) in addition to Tim McManus who tries so hard to do the right thing. While some of the action is predictable-- we are convinced that this is the way life really is in a maximum security prison-- the plot moves quickly as the episodes are short. The story is framed by an African American inmate, confined to a wheelchair, who speaks directly to the viewer, giving his commentary on the action as well as providing the background from time to time with flashbacks as to what crime each prisoner committed to get him sent to Oz.

The critics are right about this one. It is as good as this sort of drama gets. In a word, OZ is addictive.",1155686400,14,1414,4.541176470588235
1683456,4,B00005Y6YJ,"I am very late to the world of OZ, having just watched season 1 (but ready for Season 2!).  I can certainly see why this show caused such a stir.  It makes THE SOPRANOS look like SESAME STREET in its depiction of violence, drug use, language, racism, brutality, abuse and its generally pessimistic outlook on everything.

It is a highly entertaining show...don't get me wrong. I find it gripping, involving, well-acted and inventively executed.  It is well-written and directed.  The only thing I hesitate to find in it is ""deeper meaning.""  If Emerald City, this experimental unit within the larger Oswald Penitentiary (OZ), is meant to be some sort of microcosm of the world...then I can't buy into that.  These inmates have virtually no redeeming qualities.  Those that look for redemption mostly find death and disillusionment.  Those who fumble towards spiritual redemption usually fall short.  No one has pure motives...prisoners or their guardians.  I'm a cynical person...and this show is almost too cynical for me.  So I don't believe it represents ""all of humanity.""  If the show is meant to be a comment on our penal system...I'm not sure what the comment would be.  My reaction to these characters is ""Please never let ANY of these people walk the streets again.""  Are we meant to feel pity for them, or loathing?  It's hard to imagine writers, actors and directors wanting me to loath most of their characters...but I pretty much do.

Again, this is not to say that the show isn't fun.  It's lurid fun.  Sometimes it is moving.  Sometimes funny.  Sometime horrifying.  But the characters are easy to hold at arms length.

What IS great is the writing and acting.  What a fabulous cast they put together for this show.  B.D Wong, Ernie Hudson, J.K. Simmons (absolutely creepy...this guy is great at everything he does), a couple of guys who went on to star in LOST, Edie Falco (pre-Carmella Soprano, I believe), and on and on and on.  You'll recognize a lot of them, even if you don't know the names.  And let me not forget Rita Moreno...what a treat!  A tough as nails nun...she is a very believable character in all this...and remains heroic.  The writing is always excellent.  Great attention to little details.  Each character has a distinctive ""voice"" and they're all very eloquent, but always within their voice.  No one suddenly busts out with a speech they would never in a million years utter.  This gives the show a sheen of authenticity.

So, if you want to be hugely entertained by a large group of folks doing top drawer work (and aren't put off by brutal language, brutal violence and just general wallowing in the dregs of humantity), this show is a MUST.  If you're hoping for something inspirational or enlightening about the true state of our penal system...keep looking.

And I hope it goes without saying:  this show is NOT for kids.  I can't be more blunt that that.  17 and over only, I would say.",1153353600,11,2931,4.774451097804391
1683457,5,B00005Y6YJ,"The brilliantly conceived HBO prison drama ""Oz"" is the story of many stories, which involve inmates inside the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary. The introductory season into this stunning masterpiece of television is one of the best of ""Oz"". It follows new inmates like Ryan O'Reilly, Tobias Beecher, and Kareem Said as they interact with veterans like Vern Schillinger, Simon Adebisi, and Jefferson Keane.

This season has some of the greatest characters of the entire series run, and for good reason. Oz doesn't just chronicle the prisoners of Oswald, but the administration alike. We get to explore the lives of Warden Leo Glynn, Emerald city manager Tim McManus, Sister Peter Marie, Father Ray Mukada, Dr. Gloria Nathan, and Correctional Officer Diane Whittlesey.

The show is narrated by the wheelchair bound Augustus Hill, who offers a breathe of air before you dive deeper into the complex plotlines. ""Oz"" was the very first one-hour drama to ever appear on HBO, becoming a leader and model for shows like ""The Sopranos"", ""Six Feet Under"", and ""The Wire"".

If you haven't ever seen ""Oz"", I promise you won't be disappointed in the value of drama in this outstanding series. I have to say that ""Oz"" is also unbelievably brutal and gritty, but if you can stand that, you will greatly enjoy it.",1150934400,3,1302,4.990783410138249

We didn't get hooked, and didn't feel compelled to watch any episodes after season one.  There were so many places in this season where the writers could have played things out more--intensified the plot, heightened the tension, but they utterly failed.

However, I remained interested in the show enough to buy the second season but for me it's more of an educational history of cable television-type of watching. I really hope it's gonna pick up.

1683524,5,B00005Y6YJ,"The first season of 'Oz' introduces the viewer to a prison filled with low-life thugs, criminals, rapists, and all around nasty men.  Throw in some full frontal nudity, man rape, tons of cursing, double-cross upon double-cross and what do you get?  One of the grittest, most realistic, and most satisfying shows on television.

Everyone is represented in Oz:  the Aryans, the Italians, the Muslims, the Gangstas, the Latinos...pretty much every facet of a prison population.  The cast of characters is huge so get prepared to pay attention to who's who and who's doing what and why.  Don't be deterred though...just pay attention and you will reap the rewards of this fine show.  Every episode focuses on numerous different characters but most of the main ten or so receive about equal time.

The first season is excellent:  Tobias Beecher(Lee Tergeson)is a mild-mannered lawyer, sent to Oz on an involuntary manslaughter charge, who is befriended in a not-so-nice way by Aryan leader Shillinger(JK Simmons)who has a beef with the Gangstas who have a beef with the Italians who are all scared of the weird guy who ate his parents...and on and on and on.  The season is filled with layer upon layer of conflict and gives a very real sense of what life in a maximum security prison must be like.  And there's not only the prisoners, there are the employees of the prison:  numerous guards(including a pre-'Sopranos' Edie Falco), the warden(Ernie Hudson), priest(BD Wong), etc. who all deal with not only the prisoners' issues but their own as well.  Through the myriad of conflict over the course of the season, the tension builds up to a massive riot taking over the prison.  Oh, and don't get too attached to any one character because people, prisoners and guards alike, in 'Oz' die all the time and are soon replaced with new blood.

All in all, the first season of 'Oz' is great.  My only qualm being that its much too short(8 one-hour episodes)for much too high a price(as all HBO DVD sets are).  Even so, its still worth it.  There's not much in the way of extras but the quality of the episodes make up for it.  This series was one of the best on recent television and definitely worth seeing.  You really owe it to yourself to check this and the four other seasons of 'Oz' out.",1116720000,33,2283,4.717171717171717
1683525,5,B00005Y6YJ,"In a world where shock value has been beaten, bruised, and stomped into the ground, a show like ""OZ"" will come along and raise the standard for iconoclastic television a notch or two. Sure, ""Sopranos"" and ""Sex in the City"" have their grit, but ""OZ"" is the darkness of both, plus the irony of ""Six Feet Under,"" combined.

There are several excellent factors to ""OZ,"" including the cast of actors largely unknown (at the time) to the public eye. My favorite aspect of ""OZ"" is the narration that punctuates the series. Albeit sporadically badly delivered by Perrineau (mostly because of over-acting), the concept itself is genius.

On the subject of acting, I'm going to take the unpopular road here and say that Lee Tergesen (Tobias Beecher) is hyped more than he deserves it. His performance is often too histrionic and, although it would've worked on a stage, is a textbook example of Mistakes that People Make Fresh Out of Acting School.

Highlights include J.K. Simmons (Vern Schillinger), Eamonn Walker (Kareem Said), and Terry Kinney, who manages to pull of the pathetic Tim McManus very well. Sean Whitesell, who returned to write for the show after his character, Donald Groves, was killed, is a definite honorable mention.

There are also actors whose craft comes in flashes of brilliance. For instance, Dean Winters (Ryan O'Reily) is sometimes fit only for theater and sometimes absolutely perfect; Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Simon Adebisi) is often peaks and valleys in his work.

Overall, this show is incredible. Fontana writes well and rarely loses focus, except for the initally unorganized voice-over by Perrineau. Right around season 2 and 3, they finally get it together, though, and center it around certain subjects, so fear not.

I highly recommend buying the first season.",1109462400,6,1791,5.09556313993174
1683526,4,B00005Y6YJ,"I bought the Oz Complete First Season because I never got to see the show during its series run on HBO.  I'm really impressed and very glad that I did.

Oz does not hold back when it comes to telling the story of life behind bars.  This is no fairy tale and you begin to feel something for each one of the characters.  Personally, I felt sorry for Beecher (then a little sickened by him), and I fell in love with Attabisi because he just does NOT care.  He's definitely one of the most comical characters.

If you're into gritty, hard-core drama, and definitely not faint at heart, then you'll love Oz.  It tells it like it is.  I only gave it four stars because I wasn't too impressed with the whole riot thing at th end, but this set up of what's to come by the first season certainly left me looking forward to the subsequent seasons.

1683528,5,B00005Y6YJ,"What can you say about Oz other than watch it?

 Several people have described the show as ""addictive"" - it really is, the very nature of a prison being a barren, essentially monotone and boring place means the show has to rely 100% on engaging characters - the true anchor of any great TV show or film. This is where Oz shines, the range of colourful characters really does get you hooked, and the futuristic pod-style housing gives the EmCity wing a certain flavour that would definitely not be present if the series was set in an older, more traditional looking jail.

 There's no yardtime in Oz! I think these guys are just too dangerous to be let outside. There's certainly a noticable bodycount to say the least.

 If you're looking for a down-to-earh, realistic portrayal of prison then despite what some reviewers seem to be saying or implying: OZ ain't it. It's over the top and paints in vivid colour where real prison would be using greys and blacks, but this is what makes it entertaining.

 Oz has a very dark sense of humour to it which is almost hilarious at times but trust me when I say you have to have to be able to appreciate dark humour to find certain parts funny - much in the same vain as Australian celebrity criminal flick ""Chopper"". If you can look through the litres of prop blood and the hammed up actor screaming his head off while a steroid-infested TripleH look-alike puts his floor-sharpened spoon to wicked use then you might find a wry smile creeping onto your face - although I must admit that at times the violence crosses a line and there doesn't seem to be any sanctuary available while witnessing a character you really got to know and like being tortured to death by someone who's laughing at his face while he's doing it. You have to play it by ear in this respect.

 Don't get me wrong, it's not a comedy, but certain parts certainly appear to me to be deliberately blackly comic - not everyone will agree though, not everyone can see past the essentially unfunny jailhouse window-dressing. I just don't think such an over the top steroid fuelled roller-coaster of a show such as Oz should be taken too seriously is all.

 Watch it and enjoy it cos it is one of the most entertaining and unique shows ever to grace your TV screen.

1683529,5,B00005Y6YJ,"From Homicide: Life on the Street creator Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, Oz is one of the most compulsively violent and addicting shows to hit HBO.  While the Sopranos garnered most of the attention from HBO viewers, the primal nature and sheer unpredictability of Oz made the series the definition of must see TV.  Taking place in the Oswald Correctional Facility (known to the inmates as Oz) these eight episodes revolve around Emerald City: a cellblock overseen by prison reform advocate Tim McManus (Terry Kinney) and the warden Leo Glynn (Ernie Hudson) who is desperately trying to keep the peace among the inmates as the governor bans privlages including smoking and conjugal visits.  We are introduced to a cast of compelling characters whom be both pity and despise, including meek lawyer Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) whose transformation from frightened new convict to drug raddled madman must be seen to be believed, white supremicist leader Vern Schillinger (J.K. Simmons), backstabbing and double dealing Ryan O'Reilly (Dean Winters), the cocky and self loathing Miguel Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo), wheelchair bound narrator Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau), and Muslim activist Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker) whose extreme policy of non-violence explodes in the season ending riot that sets the stage for season two.  The rest of the cast, including Rita Moreno, the Sopranos' Edie Falco, and John Seda (even though he only appears in the first episode) does brilliant work, all of whom help make Oz unforgettable.  If you've never seen Oz, you should definitely check it out and see for yourself one of the best and underrated shows on HBO and maybe even TV history, but do be warned, this series is not for the squeamish.",1094860800,87,1730,5.142348754448399

The writers and actors of ""Oz"" make excellent use of all the opportunities to explore the darker sides of human life. Aside from being an engrossing drama, ""Oz"" also serves as an excellent public service announcement, in a way ... because after watching a few episodes, a person would probably think twice about doing anything that could possibly put them in such a horrific situation.",1065312000,3,775,4.834586466165414

There are only commentary tracks for the first two episodes. The first one was okay (if a little brief). I enjoyed hearing Tom Fontana and Lee Tergesen talking about the first episode as they watched it (some hilarious stuff). However, the commentary on episode two was pretty much background info on the series creation, writing, etc. While this was GREAT information, not once did they mention anything having to do with the episode we were watching. This commentary would have been nice as an additional track for episode one. I would have loved to have heard commentary from more of the actors included with ALL of the episodes.

Oz is a maximum security unit with an amazing cast of characters, all acting and interacting with each other to provide many, many, tense moments. Everyone absolutely shines in their roles, both convicts and officers, and the story never lets down for a moment. Lee Turgesen is amazing as a newbie prisoner, thrown into the hell his life will become, and arcs from victim to victimizer. Each character has an equally remarkable span, until the amazing ending that both is realisitic, and horrifying.

Well when I ended up going I was suprised to find out it was somewhat but not that bad. Oz is a great look into how prison used to be and could be all over again. Lot's of violance & so realistic! The day I bought the 1st season I sat down and watched it(all 3 disc)w/o leaving my living room, couldn't tare myself away from it. When I was done I went out and got the 2nd season and can't wait for 3rd and final seasons!

I don't understand why The Sopranos has grabbed all the glory - this show has kept me enthralled for years and saddened by it's ending; I got bored with the Sopranos after one and a half seasons.  Yes, the violence may be to graphic for some; but it's not gratutious, this is a series set in a mens prison with violent offenders.

1683613,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This is, by far, the most ambitious project that HBO has ever done.  I've seen every episode of other HBO hit shows like Sex and the City and The Sopranos, but Oz is definitely in a class by itself.  The viewer will be riveted from the very beginning of the first episode to the unforgettable season finale.
The great ensamble cast does an excellent job of portraying exactly what prison life is like.  They show that life inside Oswald State Prison (Oz) is like living at the mouth of a live volcano.  You never know when the volcano is going to erupt, and it erupts quite often.  While all the actors seem to share equal screen time, the character that stands out the most is Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen), a lawyer serving time for killing a girl while driving drunk.  He comes to Oz lacking street smarts, but he gradually learns the ropes as the season progresses.  By the final episode, he's just as vicious as all the other prisoners.  Another intriguing character is Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker), who is a passive-aggressive black Muslim militant who acts as the main shot caller.
All the basic troubles of prison life are addressed in these eight episodes.  Drugs, sex, boredom, routine, heirarchy, racism, violence, and capital punishment are all factored into the show at some point.  Though I've never been to prison, I did spend some time in county jail, so I can attest to the accuracy of this show in terms of portraying what prison might really be like.  I don't know what hell is like, but it can't be that much worse than Oz.  I very highly recommend this DVD.",1041552000,8,1577,4.5928571428571425

I mean, aren't they all bad guys?  But he does play a bad guy- the worst guy- and he plays him well.
OZ is scary.  Oz is uncompomising.  And Oz is unstoppable.  WHo'd have believed this show would last more than one season?  It's a soap opera set in prison.  Pretty near unresistable.
The best part of this set is the unfolding of the Beecher Saga.  And with voice-over from Lee, you get insight as to how the charactarization took form.

1683615,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I'm with James Fearn, Oz is the best TV drama ever. So why does this series, with its harsh, violent, brutal characters and unrestrained language and violence rate so high?
Oz is about the two most important issues we all face: sin and redemption. And not sin and redemption in a Catholic or Christian sense, but in the sense of how we all belong to and participate in humanity. To address these issues most directly, the writers (most of the time, the brilliant Tom Fontana) and producer (Barry Levinson) go to the worst sinners of all and those most in need of redemption, the prisoners (and their jailers) at Ozwald State Correctional Facility, a mythical maximum-security prison in New York.
Fontana and Levinson have dealt with these issues before, most notably in ""Homicide,"" but this time all the stakes are doubled. In Oz, violence and survival are minute-to-minute issues. So how, in the midst of such violence and brutality, does one find one's way back to a place in humanity? Some of the characters struggle to redeem themselves, some get by from day to day, some have just given up, and some go mad, like the chronically depressed and desperate Alvarez.
Of these, some even attain true redemption, coming at last to a kind of peace and reconciliation. And then Levinson and Fontana remind us of the true dilemma of redemption: it's just so damn fragile. Some of the most dramatic and heartbreaking moments of all are when we see the best characters, those who have found their fragile peace, descend once again into the violence they (and we) thought they had escaped. Because redemption isn't absolute. Like the prisoners and jailers in Oz, it lives moment to moment, and at any time we can lose our grasp on it and fall back into pit.
It's safe to say that no television drama has ever addressed these issues so directly or in such harsh, unremitting terms. Oz should stand as a classic in drama, right along with the works of Shakespeare and the ancient Greeks. Besides, once you start watching it, you just can't stop.",1038787200,2,2035,4.735211267605634

The storyline is something you just don't see anywhere else on television.  It is hard hitting and very raw.  What I like best is that no one person is the star. It is an a large cast and everyone is important to the show.
The first season sets a lot of seeds for future happenings, but it is a fine season on it's own.  You just never know what will happen.  I never saw the first 3 seasons, I watched 4 and 5 and have seen some repeats of the first 3 so watching this DVD set was a huge treat for me.  The Show is very easy to follow, has a ton of great acting and is just plan amazing.
I would suggest this to anyone who likes drama's.

The characters are fascinating. The storylines tight and riveting. Tom Fontana takes us on a wild ride and somehow manages to make us care about the criminals in this prison. It's storytelling at its best. The commentary provided by Tergesen and Fontana for the first two episodes gives insight to some of the behind-the-scenes decisions and is fascinating to listen to.

Fontana, who also created the wonderful series, ""Homicide:Life on the Streets"" brings the same great character-driven story telling to this series. Even the most reprehensible characters are so interesting you have to know what happens next, and there are some great switchbacks and surprises.  It may not be a realistic depiction of prison life, but it makes for great storytelling.

The characters are generally well-drawn. The acting is top-notch and consistent with the characters. The stories are interesting and interestingly presented, and their outcomes are not usually predictable. There are enough interwoven stories to prevent getting bored with any particular one. The production elements--hair, lighting, makeup, set design--all contribute to a consistent mood and theme and so do not distract from the stories.
I think that this series, especially season 1, is engaging entertainment for those reasons (even though my favorite character doesn't enter until season 2). The violence and language are a little unnerving at first, but they are not gratuitous nor are they anything that you won't see or hear on the streets of a major American city. And it's easier to get comfortable with such elements when they are appropriate to the action and help to move the story along. They are not there just for shock.
My criticism would be the lack of ""extras"" that you often find on DVDs, but I bought this package for the stories, not for any expected auxiliary entertainment.

With this new box set dvd of the first season, I was able to see a lot of the main characters origins in prison and see the reason for the conflict between many of the main characters.  As usual, Rita Moreno is great and Lee Tergesen and J K. Simmons are excellent as well.  A bonus is seeing the Soprano's Edie Falco in her role as a prison guard.  There are moments of intense violence, prison rape, and nudity but Oz doesn't shy away from the harsh reality of prison.  The dvd box set includes extras such as deleted scenes, commentaries and other items.  It is a good start for those of us who are fans of the HBO series but missed it in the beginning.  Now I'm hoping they will release the other seasons as well!",1021420800,,774,4.1891891891891895
1683686,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This is simply the best television series I have ever seen.  All the carry on about ""The Sopranos"" - this leaves it totally in the shade.  What writing, what direction, what acting, what risk taking!!!!  Roll on Series 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on DVD I say.  BUY IT!",1021420800,2,258,4.1
1683687,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I am a HUGE Oz fan.  Its very thought provoking, riveting, exciting, suspensful - NEVER a dull moment.  I can't wait for the next season.  I didn't start watching the series until season 4, so its good to be able to go back and see how it all started.  Lee Turgesen is fantastic in this.  The scripts are great and the acting superb.  It is very interesting to see the evolution of Tobias Beecher in this season.  I highly recommend this set even if you have never seen an OZ episode before.",1020038400,4,491,4.271739130434782
1683688,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This DVD set was well worth the wait (and what a LONG one it was)...I admit that I am a true OZ fan and have been waiting for it to receive the same notoriety as ""Sex and the City"" and other HBO dramas have.  One must realize and know that the storyline, and basic reality, of prison life is graphic and terrifying in itself and HBO's OZ captures it magnificently through the bends and twists of its characters and plots.  There is NEVER a dull moment and I would suggest this DVD to anyone who likes an on-the-edge-of-your-seat, addictive ride into the life of these prisoners.  You'll develop your own favorites, but who knows if they will last long in the concrete jungle known as Emerald City.  You'd be crazy not to pick this one up if you enjoy good drama -- it is and will forever be a classic of our times!",1019520000,7,814,4.300653594771242
1683689,3,B00005Y6YJ,"I also really wanted to like this - heard friends use words like ""riveting"" - addictive in a beach book way is exactly right - tired cliches, yet another leftist writer lecturing viewers about the correct position on current issues - the daring part is full-frontal male nudity... The acting is mostly very good - Rita Moreno is at her best here - but the writing is Quentin Tarantino-lite.  It's a fun way to waste time...",1019520000,5,423,4.565789473684211
1683690,3,B00005Y6YJ,"This is a very emotionally charged, thought provoking series, but one I quit watching after a few episodes because the male-raping-male scenes made me feel ill. If you're into watching a sadistic white supremist make a smallish hetero accountant cry while he rapes him, rip his [rear] apart until he can't walk, and brand him like a cattle so the prisoners will know he belongs to him, then whip out your credit card. If reading this synopsis made you ill, then trust me when I say the visual of it will give you nightmares. Otherwise not bad lol.",1019174400,5,547,4.591836734693878

It's so great to be able to watch the season that started it all with DVD quality.  Don't think, just buy it.",1018396800,,267,3.7142857142857144
1683732,5,B00005Y6YJ,"This is one of the DVD releases I have been looking forward to. As you probably know, Oz is HBO's prison drama. As the commercial say...'uncensored...ground breaking...etc'. Yes, it is uncensored. You can expect adult language, nudity, violence, here, but if you want that then a porn site is best. Oz is a great drama, brutal, which does feature everything I said, but also has great acting, great scripts, etc.
Anyway I you came looking for this box I assume you already knew what Oz was, so I'll comment on what you get for your money.
The box (small) comes with three single sided DVDs. The first one comes with episodes 1-3 and two audio commentaries by Tom Fontana and Lee Tergesen. The second one comes with eps 4-6. And the last one comes with eps 7 and 8 plus some extra bonus, such as deleted scenes. There isn't any booklet in the box.
The audio comes in both English (5.1, Surround) and Spanish (stereo). Because they used closed captions instead of DVD subtitles, they could only put one of the track in writing, meaning that there are no Spanish subtitles and more importantly, no commentary subtitles! Rather annoying for the hearing impaired people out there.
Video quality (4:3) is perfect, as you would expect from a show that was filmed just 5 years ago in high quality.
Running time is 451 minutes. DVD region is 1.",1018137600,2,1335,4.637130801687764
1683733,4,B00005Y6YJ,"OZ is a very powerful, emotional series that keeps you on your toes, and makes you think.  Also it makes me not want to go to prison and if I do stay away from the Arians...Aside from all the male ""junk"" I def. recommend this series to anyone who enjoys, dramas, action, excitement, and suspense.  This is one of those shows that you have no choice but to root for the bad guys, reminds me of ""A Bronx Tail"".  So enjoy and you may possibly learn a valuable lesson or two.",1017705600,,471,4.153846153846154
1683734,5,B00005Y6YJ,"While reading the editorial review of this series I was amazed to see that it was suppose to be a ""guy's show"".  Not so!  I have loved this series since it first aired on HBO and catch every rerun that is shown.  I have been one of the many fans who begged HBO to release it on video/DVD.  While I do enjoy ""The Soprano's"", ""Sex and the City"", and ""Six Feet Under"" my favorite HBO series is and has always been ""Oz"".  I think it is well-written, finely acted and not on often enough!!  I raved about this show so often to several friends that they all finally went out and started receiving HBO so they could watch ""Oz"" and none have ever regretted it.  I highly recommend this series and applaud the fact that the writers, producers, actors and directors hold NOTHING back.",1017619200,3,774,4.333333333333333
1683735,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I'd give this thing 10 STARS!!
Oz, ESPECIALLY the first season, will grip you like no other television show created. The first time I saw it, the gritty characters, the breakneck pace, the slick editorial style, the twists and turns in the plot. I was hooked!!
Oh MAN! Oz is so addictive they should put a warning sticker on it! My only complaint is that HBO waited SOOO long to put this on DVD!! This show was good before Sopranos got hot, and before Sex and The City got popular.",1017273600,3,481,4.355555555555555
1683736,2,B00005Y6YJ,"To me, this is the least successful of the HBO series. There is admittedly a ""can't watch just one"" vibe to it, but more in a junkfood/beachbook kind of way. There doesn't seem to be much substance beneath the macho swagger and need to shock. Some of its concepts (like the Mafia element) are done better elsewhere (like the Sopranos). While 90% of the performances are admirable (with the unfortunate exception of a worthless Ernie Hudson) the writing is often clunky and cliched. And the ""street philosophy from a guy in a wheelchair spinning in a glass cube"" bits are painful. I wanted to like this show, really. I just couldn't.",1017187200,14,632,4.702702702702703

I am simply amazed at how good this show really is.  To see the development of characters I have grown to love (or hate, depending on their nature) -- well, it is outstanding.  I have now rushed to purchase OZ (and will do so with every other season).  OZ will be one of my top-loved DVDs in my collection.

1683738,5,B00005Y6YJ,"Welcome to Emerald City, an experimental unit of the Oswald Maximum Security Prison or ""Oz."" As run by Tim McManus and overseen by Warden Leo Glynn, Em City is about prisoner rehabilitation over public retribution. No matter how hardened a criminal or killer, whether you're in for a few years or in for life, you have a role to play. Once inside, choose your friends carefully. Every group - Muslims, Latinos, Italians, Aryans - stick close to mutual friends and terrorize mutual enemies. Don't smile. Get yourself a weapon. Stay on everybody's good side... if you can find one
This is the setting and the backdrop to one of the BEST series on cable TV.  Oz dosen't let up for a second, it grabs you by the hair and drags you around on some buring hot coals.  A prison series that comes at the veiewer with force.
I can't give enough praise to this DVD pack to give it the attion it desserves.  I'm ready for the 2nd season.",1016755200,,925,4.461538461538462
1683739,5,B00005Y6YJ,"As great cutting-edge dramas go, ""Oz"" will definitely go down as one of the most stunning and surprising of the last ten years.  The evidence is apparent in this collection of the eight episode first season.  ""Emerald City"" (as the prison is referred to) is an experiment in the detention of convicted criminals.  However, by the last episode of the season, it turns into a powder keg, and unfortunately, everyone inside has a lit match ready.  Being a fan of gritty and complex TV shows, this is one of those shows that bothers to ask questions about the system, and more imporantly about ourselves, with no easy answers or solutions.  By the time the near apocalyptic final minutes run, you might be waiting to get back in the pen for another season...",1016668800,2,754,4.681818181818182

7956777,5,B00005Y6YJ,"I was really impressed at how true to life this series is to prison life.  The first season is especially faithful to what it is really like. There are, of course, a few errors and omissions, such as having glass mirrors, candles, not being required to get off of the walkway when encountering staff or visitors outside of the yard fence, and stepping back behind the red line after pushing the button to request the yard gate be opened.  These are really small things compared to the violence that the series captures so faithfully.  Although the first episode  is titled The Routine, it can't really show the daily boredom of prison life.  If it did, no one would watch it!  Oh, and it says nothing about the Breakfast Burritos. I still can't bring myself to order one on the outside.  However, all in all, it is a very well done show.  I love it and often recommend it to young gang bangers who think that going to prison is a good way to get their man card punched.  Just remember, guns are rude.  If you don't want to go to a rude place, don't be rude!.",1514332800,,1058,4.3520408163265305
