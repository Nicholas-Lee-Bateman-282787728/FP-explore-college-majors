1362583,4,B00004W5VE,"""The Shooting"" is an offbeat 1966 Western directed by Monte Hellman and written by Carole Eastman (using the pseudonym ""Adrien Joyce""). The story involves two men (Warren Oates and Will Hutchins) who are hired by a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins) to accompany her to a town located many miles across the Utah desert. During their journey they are tracked and joined by a mysterious black-clad gunslinger (Jack Nicholson) who is known by the woman.

This early Nicholson vehicle is worthwhile if you have a taste for out-of-the-ordinary films. Millie Perkins is fetching and Will Hutchins is a convincing youngster sidekick while Oates is a good every-man protagonist and Nicholson just oozes quiet antagonism. It's easy too see how the 'kid' would be infatuated by the cutie, despite her dubiousness, but it's even easier to understand Willet's grave suspicions. The movie is also a must for anyone who likes lost-in-the-desert flicks.

While the ending seems nonsensical, the answers are there, if you look closely and chew on the details...

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph unless you've seen the film). As the story progresses it becomes clear that the woman is hunting Oates' brother who apparently killed a child or a midget, likely the woman's child, close friend or relative. When they finally catch up to him at the very end we discover that the supposed murderer is Willet's TWIN brother who looks exactly like him, which explains his name, Coin (as in, 'the other side of the coin'). Since this is so, why didn't the woman assume Willett (Oates) was the person who killed her child since he looks exactly like the one who did, Coin? Obviously she was informed that Coin had a twin brother living near the town and she felt he would be the best person to track the culprit. In any case, the twin brothers represent the duality of human nature: Willet symbolizes the good and positive side whereas Coin embodies the more destructive aspects of our nature. As such, the Gashade brothers symbolize the two converging sides of the existential coin pertaining to the human experience which come together with catastrophic results at the climax. ***END SPOILER***

Bottom line: ""The Shooting"" is a worthy bare-bones independent 60's Western with occasional flashes of surrealism and brilliance, as well as a lot of humdrum mundaneness (so be prepared for some slow, dull stretches). It's less straightforward than its sister film ""Ride in the Whirlwind,"" which was made just before this one and on the same (or nearby) locations. Some have called it the first ""acid Western"" but I wouldn't go that far. It has some weird touches, but not too weird.

The film runs 82 minutes and was shot in Kanab, Utah.

Older VHS copies tend to have terrible sound quality, which makes the film unwatchable and probably led to a lot of the negative reviews here.

Monte Hellman's westerns are too slow for some (American) viewers. They are more akin to foreign films, particularly the existentialist new wave of the 1950s-1960s. The script is intelligent, and there is a slow building up of tension throughout the film. Warren Oates is always a pleasure to watch, with his naturalistic style of acting. Nicholson is menacing in a low-key way. The twist ending is obviously not understood by some viewers, especially if they haven't been paying attention to the dialogue along the way.",1429488000,,812,5.014814814814815

Most people that have watched them, outside of the handful that saw them years ago in theaters, have had to endure the terrible quality of old VHS tapes or their direct transfer to DVD. Using state of the art digital technology, overseen by director Monte Hellman himself, this newly enhanced version burned to Blue-ray adds an amazing level of definition considering they were filmed in the mid 60s, a great improvement.
The director Monte Hellman while not recognized by much of the public, today at 86 still possesses the same passion for the craft as he did in the 60s. Mr. Hellman has been responsible for a number of great films, among them; Two Lane Blacktop and Cockfighter, also under appreciated works.
In The Shooting the fledgling talent of Jack Nicholson stands out in the dismal setting of the desert in southern Utah. The very talented Warren Oates and Millie Perkins made them perfect for this tale of murder and obsession of revenge. Oates had the ability to play any part given to him. A very good film.
Ride the Whirlwind also features the abilities of Nicholson as well as Cameron Mitchell and once again Millie Perkins. This a more classic tale of western justice, or rather injustice. These cowpokes trying to exist in the wild west find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time and suffer the consequences.

""Ride In The Whirlwind"" stars journeyman actor Cameron Mitchell, you will recognize him but I dare you to remember a role you've seen him in even though you probably have many times if a film and TV fan. ""Whirlwind"" also sports (Harry) Dean Stanton (""Repo Man,"" ""Wild At Heart"") in a small but pivotal role. If you thought Will looked old, wait until you see Harry. His character takes the first obvious (off-screen) whiz behind a rock I've ever seen in a movie. It's the most conventional of the two plot-wise, and has a larger cast.

1362667,5,B00004W5VE,"Teaming with directors such as Stanly Kubrick, John Houston, Michealangelo Antonioni, and Bob Rafelson, Jack Nicholson has one of the finest, most diverse careers in film.

But few know the two westerns in this Blu-ray set that Nicholson made with underrated Director Monte Hellman prior to his first supporting star-turn in ""Easy Rider.""

Coming from from Roger Corman's stable, Monte Hellman is a low-budget renegade in the Mexican-era Bunuel mode, and Hellman's later ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" (1971) is considered a classic existentialist road movie that, like these westerns, initially tanked at the box office, underwhelming critics, only to be reappraised, first by devoted cult audiences who'd discovered it, and later by critics who came to realize what a unique, eccentric work it is.

I came across ""Ride in the Whirlwind"" and ""The Shooting"" by accident in the form of two 99 cent VHS copies by a company that seems to have (equally accidentally) taken unwatched classics, given them ultra-bad transfers, always with a noxious static hum swelling like a quiet ocean in the backdrop.

Even in those bad copies (Blu-ray now! wow!) I sensed something if not boldly 'great' at least unique, fascinating and experimental.

I wondered why I didn't read, hear, see more about the films, until a buddy in college, a slacker cineaste in the 90s Kurt Cobain mode -- he went to film grad school at Loyala, and I: UCLA  -- told me about ""Two Lane Blacktop"" and Hellman's ""Cockfighter,"" also with Warren Oates playing that very thing in an odd, often praised (now) work about that sick sport.

Finally reaching theaters in 1968 these westerns  -- both  -- are spare, ultra low budget works that profit from the budget limitations, and both ""Ride in the Whirlwind"" and ""The Shooting"" have strong character turns from Warren ""The Wild Bunch"" Oates, and Harry Dean Stanton, respectively.

Watching them, it stuns how much leading men change. Stanton, Nicholson, and Oates have tremendous gifts combined with the temerity to look like living, breathing men, men who walk around, buy houses, make love and lose jobs; men who could live next door, especially if you live in a working class southern neighborhood, where people keep pens of pit bulls chained up in their backyards. At this point especially they have all the specificty and are absent any sign of Hollywood glamour. Stanton and Oates will never develop a polished quality.

From these films no one then could have assumed then that Nicholson would morph into the 1970s greatest American actor, debonair in ""Chinatown,"" combustible in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and a nascent house on fire in ""Five Easy Pieces,"" let alone to the unmitigated box office superstar of the 80s, and elder of the Hollywood senate he is now.

A politically significant, much-underwatched genre by young people, the western became a fascination of mine in my early 20s. I'd heard of the genre's classics by John Ford and Howard Hawks from my father. My father was an older Dad. He has a popcorn sensibility built on matinees.

My father's talk about ""The Searchers,"" or ""Rio Bravo,"" beautifully aged during the era of big budget box office explosions built like summer money-machines in the post-Lucas and Spielberg world, made me never whince at black and white or bold Technicolor, and to Ford and Hawks I would add Anthonny Mann (the triumvirate). This is mildly controversial. Many may might place Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone, or Bud Boetticher ahead of Mann, but Mann's cycle of westerns, in which James Stewart played crazy, helped me to see film in a new way.

With archetypal western plots, simple and unadorned, the Hellman / Nicholson westerns in this set read like meditations on death and dying.

In ""The Shooting"" a complicated woman hires two hitmen to accompany her to a town lost miles across desert while a black clad gunsliger follows them like the spectre of death itself. Under Hellman's direction, the sense of place is real. The desert looks somehow more stark, empty, and alien than in even Leone's Man with No Name oaters. In ""Ride in the Whirlwind"" three cowboys attempt to get a night of much-deserved rest at an appropriately remote hideout -- that happens to belong to an outlaw gang.

By dawn, a group of vigilantes prepared to hang the westerners surround the hideout seeking frontier to enact ""justice"" on the wrong men.

Questions one might have are ""How much have we lost now that most films are built like blockbusters, and TV has become home to more experiment?"" and ""Where is today's Corman, pressing the envelope in low budget genre films that have little in common with today's indies?""

These are not favorites, but it is nice that Criterion is willing to give me, and you, a better look at them.",1408665600,,4768,4.93875

1362696,1,B00004W5VE,"Not your father's western.

Almost the entire film consists of Millie Perkins, Warren Oates, Jack Nicholson, and Will Hutchins walking and/or riding through the Utah desert to the accompanyment of melodramatic music that foreshadows virtually nothing. This may attract some people on an existential level, and there is something to be said for that interpretation. But if it's a traditional western you're looking for, you're looking in the wrong direction.

Director Monte Hellman was one of several directors who grew up under Roger Corman in the 60s. Hellman did two westerns in 1965, the other being ""Ride the Whirlwind"" and they both featured Hellman's good friend and sometimes collaborator Jack Nicholson, himself a protoge of Roger Corman. Corman financed the films.

Both of Hellman's films are considered to be ""acid westerns"", a sub genre that refers to a counter cultural look at traditional standards. Indeed, the 90 minute trek across the desert resembles one long trip, in both meanings of the word.

Warren Oates is one of the best character actors and he's especially good in westerns. His work in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) is exemplary, but so is his work in a dozen other films like ""Ride the High Country"" (1962). ""Dillinger"" (1973), and ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" (1974). But he gives a much below par performance in this one, which is all the more curious since Oates worked with Monte Hellman in the cult classic ""Two Lane Blacktop"" (1971) in which he gave a bruvura performance.

""The Shooting"" is pre ""Easy Rider"" (1969. Nicholson is just awful in this film. He plays a fast draw gunslinger with about as much conviction as a wet noddle. Hellman maintains that Nicholson's character was a satiric counter-point to Alan Ladd's ""Shane"", but personally it just looks like bad acting to me.

At some point before the long trek, Oates and Perkins have a strange conversation at the end of which Oates says ""I don't see no point."" Perkins responds ""There isn't any."" That, more of less, sums up the film. Is it a parody of traditional westerns? Is it a re-telling of the Kennedy assassination? Or is it just a bad movie?",1270252800,,2148,4.887362637362638

The film itself deserves 5 stars -- but Madacy's DVD transfer is...well, not bad, but hardly the best.  (Well, at least it's letterboxed.)

There was a top-quality DVD put out by VCI a few years back: digitally-restored, with a commentary track by director Hellman and Millie Perkins.  (VCI provided the same treatment for their DVD of the companion film, ""Ride the Whirlwind"", also directed by Hellman and starring Jack Nicholson.)

Both ""The Shooting"" and ""Whirlwind"" VCI DVDs are now sadly out-of-print -- here's hoping for a re-issue of those restored transfers!",1254873600,,1079,4.917127071823204
1362698,3,B00004W5VE,"It's best to get it out of the way right up front - 'The Shooting' looks like a Western, smells like a Western, even tastes like a Western, but that don't make it a Western.  It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, if you go into this movie with any sort of 'Western' expectation, you're likely to come out disappointed.  I think it's important to emphasize this - the genre description of 'Western' has too many connotations, and although 'The Shooting' may initially stay faithful to many of those conventions, in the end it morphs into something completely different.

And in case I've not been clear enough, don't misinterpret 'something completely different' to mean revisionist or surprise ending.  Though they are nothing alike, 'The Shooting' has more in common with Sartre's 'No Exit' than 'Gunsmoke'.  Whether by design or by accident, the film raises questions that are never truly answered, though there seems to be enough clues if one could only get them sorted out.  In some ways, I think that that is an illusion - what's there on the screen is exactly all there is.

And what there is is The Woman (never named, but played by Millie Perkins) who hires two miners (Warren Oates and Will Hutchins) to guide her across the Utah desert into Kingsley.  Will Gashade (Oates) has only just returned to the mining camp after going after supplies, and Coley (Hutchins as a young naive hand) has told him that the other two miners, Gashade's brother Coin and another partner Drum had went into town and Coin had accidentally ridden down a man and a 'little person', possibly a child.  No one knew if they were dead or hurt.  Coin vamoosed, and Drum was killed by a sniper while sitting around the campfire a few hours later.

Eventually, it becomes apparent that The Woman has hired the two miners not just to take her to Kingsley, but to track down Gashade's brother.  In the desert, they are joined by a young Jack Nicholson, who plays a dandified hired killer.  The party of four proceed across the desert, spiralling into a furnace of mistrust and fear and desperation.

If the synopsis sounds fairly straightforward, many of the characters' actions are inexplicable, right from the very beginning.  When a movie resorts to this kind of storytelling, most of us are used to some kind of explanation at the end, some kind of drawing together of all the loose ends and tying them up, and we'll wait patiently for the payoff.  Like real life, though, you won't get that here, and I think many people felt cheated by that in the end.  I found this approach (whether intended or not) more interesting than if the director had explained away all the motivations and inconsistencies of his film, but I was also prepared for the type of film that this was by some of the reviews I'd already read.  Going into it blindly, I may not have been nearly as charitable with my rating (though to be fair, I'm not a big western fan, and probably wouldn't have checked it out at all had I not been aware of the intricacies of the film.)

In the end, even though I enjoyed it, I can fully understand each of the negative reviews of this film.  What's important before deciding to watch this movie is to understand that any questions you have at the beginning will still be there when the credits roll, and that there will not be a resolution to the film so much as it will pick and prod at sociological and psychological behavior.  In other words, a set piece that borders on an examination of archetypical characters, without providing any answers for us.  Not an easy film, but in my opinion, certainly a fascinating one.",1238630400,,3646,4.62888198757764
1362699,4,B00004W5VE,"The Shooting is an offbeat 1966 Western directed by Monte Hellman, with a screenplay by Carole Eastman (using the pseudonym ""Adrien Joyce""). The story is about two men (Warren Oates and Will Hutchins) who are hired by a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins) to accompany her to a town located many miles across the desert. During their journey, they are closely tracked and later joined by a malevolent black-clad gunslinger (Jack Nicholson) who is known by the woman.

This early Nicholson vehicle is definitely worthwhile especially if you have a taste for out-of-the-ordinary films. Millie Perkins is quite fetching and Will Hutchins is a convincing youngster sidekick, while Oates is a good every-man protagonist and Nicholson just oozes ee-vil. The film is also a must for anyone who likes lost-in-the-wilderness flicks (like me).

I was almost going to give the film 3 Stars because of the nonsensical ending. What's wrong with the ending? ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph unless you've seen the film). As the story progresses it becomes clear that the woman is hunting Oates' brother who apparently killed a child or a midget, likely the woman's child. When they finally catch up to him at the very end we discover that the supposed murderer is Oates' TWIN brother who looks exactly like him. Since this is so, why didn't the woman assume Oates (Willett Gashade) was the person who killed her child since he looks exactly like the one who did (Coin Gashade)? ***END SPOILER***

The answers ARE there if you look closely and reflect.

Regardless, ""The Shooting"" is a worthwhile independent 60s Western with occasional flashes of brilliance.  Some have called it the first ""acid Western"" but I wouldn't go that far. It has some weird touches, but not too weird.

1362700,3,B00004W5VE,"Monte Hellman directed the influential 1967 flick, ""The Shooting.""  The movie opens with Will Gashade (Warren Oates), a former bounty hunter, returning to his small mining camp.  One of his partners, Coley Boyard (Will Hutchins), tells him that the camp was attacked earlier, and Will's brother (Coin) took off into the night.  The next day, a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins) appears at the camp and hires Will to take her to a nearby town.  Will is hesitant to accept the job from this rude woman who refuses to tell him why she needs a guide or even her name.  However, when she offers Will and Colley $1000, they finally accept.  Things don't go as expected, and they are soon joined by a hired gun, played by Jack Nicholson.  This wild ride culminates in a doozey of an ending.

""The Shooting"" is seen by many as the first acid western - a genre of revisionist Western incorporating a sixties hippie aesthetic and existentialist sensibility.  It's like combining ""Easy Rider"" and ""The Unforgiven.""  As such, ""The Shooting"" is an interesting movie that should interest fans of offbeat 60s cinema.  However, be advised that it's a low-budget affair (made for just $75,000), with occasional shoddy acting and camera work; the sound is also fairly bad, with some dialogue nearly inaudible.  The story by Carole Eastman (""Five Easy Pieces""), though, is an interesting twist on the typical revenge/hired gun western.  The movie was filmed all on-location in the Utah desert, making it one of the more austere westerns and adding to its feeling of authenticity.  Hellman also used all natural light, again adding to its starkness and realism.

Monte Hellman previously had worked extensively with b-movie genius Roger Corman, which is how he met a young Jack Nicholson.  He was just starting to become the auteur he'd later become with 70s mini-masterpieces like ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and ""Cockfighter.""  Although rough around the edges, stick with ""The Shooting"" and enjoy the ride.",1232409600,,1980,5.024539877300613
1362701,1,B00004W5VE,"This may well be one of the STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen. Veteran actor Warren Oates tries valiently to save it, but he really is swimming against a cross-current of abysmal fellow-actors, unbelievable unsympathetic characters, inchoherant writing (I would never refer to this stuff as a ""script"") and the poorest sound quality I can ever remember. I kept watching, hoping something - anything - interesting might happen at some point. No soap. My biggest disapointment was Will Hutchins. I was a big fan of his Tom 'Sugarfoot' Brewster character, but the idiot he portrays in this flick was sickening to watch. I can understand now why I never saw more of him in more movies. He got lucky with one role that was well-written, and well-shot, with decent co-actors to carry him, but he could never bring much to the ""game"" by himself.
The actress in this movie, Millie Perkins, was too lightweight for just about any kind of movie that required her to learn lines (if you get my drift) and not pretty enough for any other kind, although she did appear in Ensign Pulver. I can't imagine why.

Jack Nicholson puts in an extended cameo. Mumbles about a half-dozen lines and gets beat up. I was impressed with his quick-draw, but we never learn exactly why he's in the movie. Well, he DOES kill Hutchins, and THAT was certainly worth a days scale pay, I suppose.

Do yourself a favor - skip this one.",1221091200,,1398,4.678861788617886
1362702,2,B00004W5VE,"Let's be honest about something. Warren Oates did some great acting in a lot of really, really bad movies. He didn't have much to work with but tore into his role like a starving man in ppen all night deli. Much of what came out of the late 60s was artsy garbage and this is firmly in that camp.

Warren's character takes a job guiding a mysterious woman into the dessert. She's tracking someone and has also hired a killer to finish the guy off when she gets him. The killer is played by a young Jack Nicholson and you just know from the get go that he's going to try to shoot all the other men just for kicks more so than the reward money.

They don't have enough water and have no provisions for food or their horses but go into the dessert anyway. Eventually it becomes clear that probably no-one good or bad is going to make back home but they keep going. Finally there is a weird (complete with 60s drug trip music and funny camera angles) scene where the woman finally catches up with the guy she's been tracking. At the end I sat up and asked what the heck happened. Supposedly this waste of film is some kind of metaphor for Vietnam or the terrors of suburbia, or  perhaps it's a poor tribute to the Twilight Zone or maybe someone just fooled the studio into bank rolling this and had to come up with some ""intellectual"" sounding excuse as to why it is the silly way it is. Watch it for Warren Oates or watch it so you can see Jack Nicholson as a punk kid but don't expect this to be a real Western.",1220227200,,1508,4.175257731958763

1362795,4,B00004W5VE,"I'm not sure about the other DVDs in their catalog, but I was pretty happy with the Madacy transfer of THE SHOOTING.  It's the first time I've found it letterboxed (although it looks like it might by 1:76 rather than 1:85, barely noticable by how closely cropped the credits are) but otherwise the color and picture is brighter and sharper than I've ever seen.  There is some slight distortion from time to time (from what looks to be degeneration of a video master) but this is rather slight and probably only noticeable to those who are picky about such things.  Sure, I'd love to see Criterion release this (along with Hellman's CHINA 9 LIBERTY 27) but for a bargain DVD the Madacy disc left me more than satisfied.",1146787200,,718,4.59375

1362797,2,B00004W5VE,"This DVD release of THE SHOOTING from Passion Productions is NOT the version that comes with trailer and commentary released several years ago.  This release has absolutely no extras.  Yet, if you can't find the other (as I haven't been able to do), then this version is a decent transfer and it's certainly worth it to see this odd, esoteric, existential Western from Monte Hellman.
Let's hope the previously released version with commentary from Monte Hellman, Millie Perkins and the American Cinematheques Dennis Bartok is released again.  The commentary for this and RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND were terrific.",1082937600,,607,5.173469387755102
1362798,4,B00004W5VE,"In the spring of 1965, Roger Corman, the king of profitable, low budget movies, helped produce (without credit) two amazing films that have achieved legendary cult status.  Now, thanks to VCI Home Video, Monte Hellman's ""THE SHOOTING"" and ""RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND"" are available on DVD in pristine, widescreen transfers.  The films are subtly interconected.
Both films star a then unknown Jack Nicholson and super starlet Millie Perkins and were shot simultaneously on location in Utah for the modest amount of $150,000.  Nicholson also wrote and co-produced ""Ride in the Whirlwind"" which is a straightforward tale  of the making of a bad man and features sharp performances from Cameron Mitchell, the great Harry Dean Stanton, Rupert Crosse and Katherine Squire among others.
After accidentally happening on a group of outlaws, and getting caught in the crossfire by a sheriff and his posse, Wes (Jack Nicholson) is mistaken for one of the gang and escapes.  But, in order to defend himself during his flight, has to start killing.  By the end of the film he has become a legendary and mythic figure.  Quentin Tarantino, a big fan of Hellman, has called this ""one of the greatest films ever made.""
In the ""The Shooting,"" former bounty hunter turned miner Gashade (Warren Oates) returns to his diggings to find one of his partners, Leland, dead, his brother Coigne gone, and his third partner, Coley (Will Hutchins) holed-up in a nearby cave. Soon, a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins) materializes out of nowhere and offers Gashade a huge sum of money to guide her on a journey he soon realizes is a manhunt.
The quirky screenplay is by Adrien Joyce, the odd pen-name of the brilliant screenwriter Carole Eastman who wrote the acclaimed ""Five Easy Pieces"" which also stars Nicholson.
What ""The Shooting"" is actually about is anybody's guess.  It has been called an existential western, or anti western.  The super low-budget enforced a minimalist, almost surrealistic style that is terrific and timeless.  The stark outdoor locations add immensely to the mood and of this this strange, enigmatic story that seems to reflect mid 60's paranoia and disillusionment.
Since their initial release, both films, though seldom seen, have become critical favorites, and have attained cult film status here and in Europe. Both discs include an entertaining and revealing commentary by director Monte Hellman and actor Millie Perkins with additional informed commentary by American Cinematheque programmer Dennis Bartok.",1009929600,,2506,5.211442786069652

Shot entirely in the gorgeous Utah desert sceneries, THE SHOOTING relates the story of a hunting. Who is hunted and who is hunting is one of the multiple unanswered questions of this unusual western. The name of the character played by Millie Perkins is never uttered, she is only credited as ""The Woman"". Is she the mother of the child Warren Oates's brother would have hurted during a ride into town ? Just guess.
Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson were both part of producer Roger Corman's unbelievable nest of future stars, they teamed up in 1967 for THE SHOOTING and RIDE IN A WHIRLWIND shot simultaneously. All I can say is that THE SHOOTING is a kind of UFO in the american production of this period and deserves to stay in your collection as an example of what can be done with a restricted budget and a lot of good ideas. Simply amazing.
I had a few problems with the menus of the DVD, never knowing where I was because the different available features were not lightened. But fortunately I know how to count until ten and made my way through the menus where I discovered filmographies, a picture gallery, different trailers and a very informative commentary said by Monte Hellman and Millie THE WOMAN Perkins. I eventually learned that Jack Nicholson was helped by a technical trick when he had to draw his gun. Simple but efficient.
