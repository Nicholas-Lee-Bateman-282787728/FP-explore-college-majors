2789867,5,B000O59A52,"Perry Mason fans waited a long time for a DVD release of the finest courtroom drama ever to be broadcast into homes. It was entertainment that kept viewers glued to their seats, waiting for that moment when Perry would nail the killer on the witness stand and free his client. Once the first season was released it was only a matter of time until season two followed, and it finally has.

Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered for the tough defense attorney you wanted on your side in the toughest jam. Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger was the perfectly cast guy you almost felt sorry for, as just when he was ready to gloat over his victory in court, Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer, once again defeating poor old Burger. The relationship of these four people made the mood and mystery of the often gripping conclusion fun to watch. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.

Erle Stanley Gardner's original creation of Perry Mason was a bit more two-fisted pulp type reading, but slowly grew into something resembling the show when it became so popular. Gardner's Perry Mason novels, begun decades before the show and continuing for decades more, are still fun to read. The same can be said of every single show in the series.

The second season cemented Perry, Della, Paul, and even Burger and Lt. Trag as weekly visitors into the homes of a large section of Americans. Like the novels, the title of every episode began with ""The Case of-"" and each one had some wonderful moments, both in and out of the courtroom. Just as with the first release, the second season will be split into two releases, half the season's episodes on each release. The full episode list for season two is as follows:

The Case of the Corresponding Corpse---The Case of the Lucky Loser---The Case of the Pint-Sized Client---The Case of the Sardonic Sergeant---The Case of the Curious Bride--The Case of the Buried Clock---The Case of the Married Moonlighter---The Case of the Jilted Jockey--- The Case of the Purple Woman---The Case of the Fancy Figures---The Case of the Perjured Parrot---The Case of the Shattered Dream---The Case of the Borrowed Brunette---The Case of the Glittering Goldfish---The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll---The Case of the Fraudulent Foto---The Case of the Romantic Rogue---The Case of the Jaded Joker---The Case of the Caretaker's Cat---The Case of the Stuttering Bishop---The Case of the Lost Last Act---The Case of the Bedeviled Doctor---The Case of the Howling Dog---The Case of the Calendar Girl--- The Case of the Petulant Partner---The Case of the Dangerous Dowager---The Case of the Deadly Toy---The Case of the Spanish Cross---The Case of the Dubious Bridegroom---The Case of the Lame Canary

It seems that almost everything on television is getting a DVD release as of late, many of little or no significance. Perry Mason was not only a terrific show, but an important part of television history, and our culture as Americans. TV didn't get any better, and only on rare occasions was it as good. Just a fantastic show, both entertaining and, today, nostalgic. A can't miss.",1178150400,98,3557,4.900332225913621
2789868,5,B000O59A52,"This is one of the most interesting television series ever. Although there are complaints about the split season sale of Perry Mason, I remember the VHS (two-episode) tapes going for $20.00 a pop, plus shipping and handling.  One season would have cost almost $400.00.  At $66.00, this is a bargain.  I just hope CBS releases all nine seasons.",1176422400,35,343,4.879310344827586

What really impressed me was the quality of the performances.  Raymond Burr is Perry Mason.  Barbara Hale played Della with a fine sense of character.  William Hopper has just the right mischieviousness for Paul Drake.  What can I say, These people are the characters they portrayed.  This is the grandfather of all courtroom dramas.  Many have tried to imitate, but none have duplicated the drama, suspense and humor in these stories.  The biggest mystery is how can I hold out until the release date?  That's a killer for sure.",1174003200,66,701,4.663934426229508

These fifteen TV films from 1958 are based on the novels by Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is not experienced by most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings. The cars tell of product placement. A story adapted from a novel has the year.

The sound is probably OK for those with normal hearing, but it is not good enough for me to understand the dialog.  I also purchased Season Two in the same order and got the same results.

I really like the intelligence and honor of Perry Mason, the resourcefulness of Paul Drake, the efficiency of Della Street, the skillful way in which the central conflicts are set up so quickly in the first 2 or 3 minutes, the courtroom drama, and the fact that justice and the rule of law is always served. I also like seeing those big, beautiful cars of the `50s and a clean, prosperous looking California as it once was in the 1950s. It's more than nostalgia that draws me to these old programs; it's a glimpse back at a time of intellectual heroes, honor, justice, and optimism, rather than today's evasion and corruption.",1372982400,,685,4.622950819672131

The District Attorney Mr. Burger is shown to be less of a pedantic single-minded apparatchik and more of a man truly interested in justice. We see a little bit more of Della's personality. Paul is the butt of more jokes. And of course, there are the characters that Perry Mason deals with! While not as ""over-the-top"" as Burke's law, there are definitely some episodes worth watching just for the acting talent. There seemed to be more creative use of music and camera shots as well. Overall, very enjoyable TV.",1368316800,,624,4.73394495412844

In almost all cases there is an apology at the beginning of the film making excuses for possible problems due to the age of the product.  In this case there is no need to make any allowances.  The picture is sharp and clear, in my opinion it rivals many newer DVDs.
It is difficult to believe that the program was broadcast in the fifties and is therefore over fifty years old.  By the way, everything I said about this item is true for the First Season which I purchased earlier.  Originally I had not intended to buy any more seasons of Perry Mason, but it is not easy to resist such superior quality.
The only thing that could improve this series would be subtitles for the hearing-impaired.  But I could not take any points away for that, since everything else was so perfect.

With so much junk on current TV, it's a pleasure to be able to acquire classic TV series' like this Perry Mason (and Matlock, Murder She Wrote, Columbo, Rockford Files and others). There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion). The reality shows are unreal and stupid with most having mercenary goals. And don't even get me started on the low morals and quality of Saturday morning cartoons.

2790008,5,B000O59A52,"This release is of the first part of #2 of ""Perry Mason,"" the famed 1957-66 CBS legal series. The major players are all still here: Raymond Burr as the titular defense attorney in L.A.; Barbara Hale as his confidential secretary, Della Street; William Hopper as his loyal investigator on retainer, Paul Drake; William Talman as prosecutor/D.A. Hamilton Burger, who, try as he might, for the most part never succeeded against Perry (although he would win a couple later); and Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg, L.A.P.D. homicide detective.

The basic format had by this time been set, in that a murder would be committed, and several suspects would be established; Mason and his team would go to work sleuthing and digging up evidence for the courtroom segments (usually pretrial evidentiary hearings; this technique was used to save money on hiring 12 extras as jurors). Burger and Mason would duke it out every week in the courtroom, but usually Mason would come out smelling like a rose, in that he was able to finger the real killer, either through hard-hitting cross-examination (where the witness would admit guilt), or by having one of the spectators stand up and admit to doing the crime.

This release of the first part of #2 is of the first 15 outings from Sept. 1958 to the end of Jan. 1959, on 4 discs (#2 had 30 outings). The four discs come in 2 slipcases, 2 discs per case. Whereas the 2 releases of #1 listed the outings on each case, but no airdates, this first volume of #2 does show airdates with the episode listings. The menu for each disc has an added new wrinkle with this release: the option of playing all outings at once. Previously, when one outing ended, if you wanted to see the next, you had to press the Play button or equivalent on your remote. Not anymore!

The menu also, for this release, shows the full release name and the disc number on each menu; the cursor is in the form of a white gavel that turns black and disappears when you select an outing or press ""Play All.""

The 15 outings are superbly remastered from how they were when they were originally on CBS, and they are uncut and kept at original CBS running length.

One more thing: while the menus on #1's releases had Fred Steiner's famous title track behind them, the menus here have no music, at least from what I've seen.

Again, this release is a must-have if you are a fan of good legal drama or of classic television the way it was meant to be seen.",1355961600,,2442,4.538636363636364

2790015,5,B000O59A52,"A lawyer turned author, Erle Stanley Gardner began writing Perry Mason novels in the 1930's, and continued doing so for about 40 years.  Practicing law in Los Angeles, Perry Mason was a most unusual attorney, proactively investigating and getting involved in open cases, and at times flirting with breaking the law.  Specializing in homicide cases, the adventures of the intrepid lawyer were featured in movies and on radio, before coming to television in 1957 where it became a long running hit for CBS, and an all time classic in the criminal law genre.

The program was perfectly cast, with Raymond Burr as Perry Mason, Barbara Hale as his super loyal secretary Della Street, William Hopper as droll private investigator Paul Drake, William Talman as the combative Hamilton Burger, and Ray Collins as the determined homicide detective Lt. Tragg.

This set contains half of the thirty episodes produced in Season Two (1958-59), on four discs.  As in the premier season, the stories are a combination of adaptations of Gardner's original novels (6 episodes), and brand new adventures written just for the series (9 episodes).  Mason's cases are usually complex, demanding the viewer's attention, if they are to follow along and perhaps figure out the solution.  Because the stories are often true to Gardner's novels, readers of the books might already know the solution, but the well executed performances still make for an interesting watch.

While nearly every Perry Mason novel is regarded by fans as being a ""classic"", this collection of episodes contains some superb adaptations of some of Gardner's works.  Mason's clients often were young women in distress, such as in ""The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll"", where Mildred Crest (Ruta Lee) is accused of killing a man with an ice pick.  Gardner's ingenuity is featured in ""The Case of the Buried Clock"", where a wind up alarm clock features in the commission of a murder.  Clients would often consult with Mason, and then become defendants in a murder case, as in ""The Case of the Borrowed Brunette"", where Eva Martell and her aunt are hired to impersonate someone, and then unexpectedly get involved in a homicide.

The program usually followed a pattern, typically beginning with the setup and commission of the crime, followed by the investigation, and then finishing in court.  This format provided ample opportunities to feature many different settings and locations, as Perry Mason did not spend his time in an office sitting behind a desk.  He was more like a detective, often at the front line of the action, working with the help of Della and Paul to discover the truth, staying one step ahead of the police, and doing whatever it took to solve the case.  The program provided many juicy dramatic roles, for various character actors from the era.

Mason's proactive approach, and courtroom theatrics, may not have been realistic, but it certainly makes for some extremely compelling, classic television.  Over time, the price of the set has come down to a more reasonable level, and it occasionally goes on sale as well.",1322956800,,3083,5.025540275049116
2790016,3,B000O59A52,"I love the old Perry Mason series, and the quality of the restoration/remastering to DVD is excellent. The episodes all look brand new. In that aspect, I am tremendously pleased.

A few things disappoint me about the set. First of all, Season 1 featured original sponsor end credits, which were interesting. Season 2 does not. That may be original - I don't know. Also, there are no bonus features of any kind on this set or on Season 1.

I bring this up because I have 2 seasons (seasons 1 and 4) of ""I Love Lucy"", released by the same company (Paramount/CBS), and both seasons feature all sorts of bonus features, from flubs to original sponsor openings, radio broadcasts, trivia, musical numbers, etc. You can pick up each season of ILL for under $30 most anyplace, but the feature-anemic Perry Mason sets are broken into half-seasons and each half runs about $35. That's a significant difference of around $42, and I'm kinda P.O'd at Paramount/CBS over it. Yes, I know ILL is far more popular than PM, but for the money they charge they could at least have thrown in SOME interesting bonus features that would appeal to the show's fans.

Great character actors that we've seen in other films, most notably, Jerome Cowan from the Maltese Falcon and as Dagwood Bumsteads boss, Mr. Radcliffe. A lot of bickering from others about the season being split into two volumes with high price tags. I can only add: how much do you pay for a single 2 hr DVD? The volumes here, are about 13-14 hours; about 6 to 7 single 2 hr movies. Usually the price is reduced. I paid about $60 for 30 episodes of vol. 1 and vol. 2 combined.

Why is this duplication happening; doesn't the producer(s) of these Episode's review the last Volume's?

I'm really disappointed, as these Volumes are not cheap, why pay for episodes you already have from the previous volume; just doesn't make sense.

This is really, really strange, repeated episodes from S2,Vl, on S2, V2, and S3, V1.  What's even more disheartening, is that I initally purchase episodes, per disk, before they started making them via, Volumes, so now I have more duplicate episodes than I want or need!

2790028,3,B000O59A52,"When Paramount released the first season of Perry Mason in two parts, I picked it up and enjoyed the heck out of it. I may not be the consumer they were looking for as a nigh-30 year-old, but thankfully I love noir and Perry did a great job on atmospherics. It's aged extremely well. I wasn't happy about them splitting it in two, but I understood. After all, a modern series only has 22 episodes per year and the first season offered nearly that per volume.
The second season is a different story, however. With fewer episodes in this season, it's unacceptable for Paramount to divide the show and still charge the same amount. The same thing has been done with Gunsmoke, but that's even worse because the early episodes were only half an hour long. I understand that ""classic TV"" is a bit more niche than the latest huge blockbuster of a series and it won't sell as well. (In many instances, I'm thrilled just to see some of the '50s classics that don't even show up on TV Land anymore.) It's just not worth the high cost for many of these series. I plan to pick up the rest of the Perry Mason releases, but without a large sale, it won't be soon and will probably be used.",1219795200,10,1175,4.345454545454546
2790029,5,B000O59A52,"My evidence professor at the University of Georgia Law School was an expert on scientific evidence who had taught many years at the University of Southern California. Professor Ball knew Erle Stanley Gardner well, and would sometimes have him speak to his classes there.

Ball was somewhat dismissive of Gardner however saying that Gardner would insist on talking about how individual blood droplets at a crime scene could point to the killer. Time has proven that Gardner was right and that blood splatter evidence even in pre-Dexter, pre-DNA days could be effectively used to convict murderers. The best real life example of this is contained in Joe McGinniss' classic account of the investigation of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald.,[ASIN:0451165667 Fatal Vision]],

My point is that Perry Mason has aged well. This enormous collection of episodes, many based on original work by Gardner, shows Mason continuing his incredible victory streak over Hamilton Burger, who in today's legal climate would be run out of town on a rail in the manner of Marcia Clark and Chris Darden.

Trial lawyers understand that no DA ever gets it as wrong as Burger and no lawyer can hope to represent only the falsely accused. Mason's show gives us something to savor and learn from. Mason's success is the product of incredible preparation and mastery of details. Even if the experts (like Professor Ball) think something can't be done, Mason is unafraid to try. This is what separates real lawyers from cartoon lawyers like Denny Crain.

There is not much more to add to my review of Season 1, except to say that the screenplays in Season 2 seemed more professional and the non-recurring actors seemed more polished and less melodramatic.  However, as with Season 1, the core actors (Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, William Hopper, William Talman and Ray Collins) carry the show.  (As a marketing note, Amazon would be well advised to list Raymond Burr as the actor for each of the Perry Mason DVDs, if not the entire core cast.  Now, each DVD lists Ray Collins as the sole actor, and he is certainly not representative of the series.)  I think I watched Season 2, Volume 1 in several days, making it very clear to my wife and daughter that I could not be disturbed.  There is no television today that comes close to the kind of classic television drama portrayed in this series.  I think that this was a period of television where the psychological and dramatic interplay of characters predominated as in ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents.""

2790038,5,B000O59A52,"I've been a fan of Erle Stanley Gardner's lawyer, Perry Mason, ever since college, and that was too long ago for me to remember. When the TV series appeared, and I first saw Raymond Burr cast in the lawyer role, I was a bit surprised, since he had previously played ""heavies"" in the movies. But I quickly adapted to his style, and discovered how deliciously angry was his constant opponent, District Attorney Hamilton Burger. For years, whenever these shows were re-run, I watched them. But a few years ago they ceased to be re-run in my area, and I was sad. Now with the release of DVDs of the old show's first season and a half I can lean back at the end of a hard day's work and enjoy them all over again. The quality of the r eproduction in the DVDs is excellent: good sound, sharp picture. But as a senior citizen, I have discovered that it is dangerous to watch them after about 9 PM, since I have a tendency to doze in the easy chair. And if there is one thing that always characterized the tight plots transferred from books to TV, it is that viewers need to be very alert and keep in mind all the characters and what was said about them earlier in the show. So if you are young and alert, or if you are older but can watch the shows in a straight-back chair and early enough in the evenings, I wholeheartedly recommend the Perry Mason DVD series.

2790047,5,B000O59A52,"I know of at least two episodes where it ""could"" be said that Perry lost a case.

Towards the end of the first season, aired on CBS-TV in Spring 1958, is ""The Case of the Terrified Typist"", an episode title that was actually used for one of Erle Stanley Gardner's ""Perry"" novels.

In this episode, at least the CBS-TV version, Perry defends a client by the name of Duanne Jefferson. It turns out that the ""real Duanne Jefferson"" by name is NOT guilty, but the person who has stolen the identity of Duanne Jefferson is guilty. Perry makes this clear towards the end, and claims to have won the case, since the NAME of Duanne Jefferson is who he really defended, not the individual who stole the identity, depsite the fact that the identity thief is the defendant that is sitting next to Perry throughout the entire courtroom scenes.

In the 7th Season, 1963/64, and I guess we'll have to wait 5-7 more years for CBS/Viacom/Paramount to release the DVD set of season?, there is ""The Case of the Deadly Verdict"". This episode starts off in a darkened courtroom, late at night. The lights are switched on, and we realize that this is a darkened courtroom at night, but filled with spectators. One of them asks the bailiff who just switched-on the lights, if the jury has come to a decision. The jury then files in, takes their twelve seats in the jury box, and the Judge, as well as Perry & Della, and Burger and either Tragg or Lt. Anderson (played by Wesley Lau, NOT Lt. Steve Drumm from 1965/66 played by Richard Anderson), are also all present.

The jury is asked by the judge or bailiff if they've come to a verdict... which was that Perry's female client was GUILTY AS CHARGED! The judge asks Perry if he has a statement to make, to which Perry replies, ""No, your honor, not at this time"", or something like that, while the music score starts up and then fade to the first commercial!

Throughout the episode, Perry tries to get a brand new trial, or appeal the case to higher courts, etc. The client is being transferred to Death Row, and all... but by the end of the episode, Perry is able to reveal the REAL guilty murderer, get them to confesss to all including Hamilton Burger, and then get his client cleared and released.

But as for the first season DVD Release, and the DVD Release of the first half of the second season -- and probably all future seasons or half-seasons released, themselves .... they are all JUST PERECT!

Excellent video and audio quality, and great content quality!

The cars, the fashions for both men and women, the office decor, the decor in people's apartments or mansions, etc. are just SO perfectly 1950s/60s, even though they are in B&W, which itself is even a plus!

I grew up in the 1960s/70s watching reruns of ""Perry"" in rerun syndication to local TV stations, and then in then watched/taped reruns on cable TV stations in the 1980s/90s. Even a local broadcast station, actually the CBS-TV affiliate which originally signed on the air in my TV market in Fall 1957 when Perry also premiered, reran Perry in syndication in the late 1980s/early 1990s!

Perry is in there with other numerous B&W 1950s/60s TV shows since it made me appreciate B&W TV shows and movies of the era!

Another ""plus"" for the series in the music score used in most seasons' episodes, the same music score used in other CBS-owned TV and Radio series, such as Twilight Zone, Rawhide, Gunsmoke (radio and TV), Have Gun Will Travel (radio and TV), Suspense (CBS Radio), Johnny Dollar (CBS Radio), and also CBS Radio dramas of the 1970s-era... ALL of these great CBS-TV and CBS-Radio dramas of the 1950s/60s (and even CBS-Radio of the 1970s) used this same great ""haunting"" package of music score! Even a non-CBS series, ""The Fugitive"", ABC-TV, QM/UA Productions, 1963-67, ""borrowed"" from this CBS music score package (although ""Fugitive"" also used other music score packages as well, including music score used on the 1959-63 Desilu/QM ""Untouchables"")!

And I can't wait for the first half of the first season and later packages of ""Fugitive"" to be released on DVD, as well as further seasons/half-seasons of ""Untouchables""!",1186358400,2,4136,4.697513812154696

2790054,4,B000O59A52,"I am a diehard Perry Mason fan, but this compilation doesn't bowl me over as much as the first round did. It seems that everyone had gotten the formula down and wasn't working quite as hard. The producers seemed insistent that the tag end with a laugh, even if it was a forced laugh based on a forced joke. The only episode in this collection that didn't have that was the ""goldfish"" episode, which was bizarre to begin with.

The plus points: Della always looked fabulous; Perry was always brilliant; Paul had the greatest hair. Those things never changed. And Hamilton Burger seemed like he had an incredibly sexy body under his suit... but I'm sure that's just my opinion.

But one thing that starts to get incredibly irritating: Lt. Tragg always manages to get on the scene within nano-seconds of Perry, and is always absolutely righteously convinced that whatever suspect (male/female) he's picking up is without a doubt the murderer. Then, when Perry proves him absolutely WRONG, there is no remote acknowledgment on Tragg's part, giving the impression that he thinks he was STILL right and that's it's just by smoke and mirrors that Perry was able to work his magic.

There is only one episode (not in this collection) that I can recall where Tragg, after hearing the verdict (in the defendant's favor, of course) may have recanted ever so slightly and acknowledged that Perry was right. This sort of ""know-it-all"" attitude become extremely irritating and all you want to do is say, ""Gee, Lt. Tragg, I guess you were wrong -- AGAIN.""

Raymond Burr, as Mason, is like the 007 of lawyers. He is always totally cool, calm, collected. He always knows he is going to win because of his superior intellect. In fact, the character of Mason was actually too smart for this show. The producers were obsessed with bringing in busty starlet types who would be accused of murdering so-and-so. They seemed intent on trying to create a quasi-romantic interest for Perry, when EVERYBODY knew that Della harbored an unrequited love for him.

The one thing that seems bizarre about this show in 2007 is that NO ONE has any sex life. The only one who MIGHT is Paul, who always seems to be chasing skirts. Della and Perry were either anatomically altered audio-animatronic robots or were taking harsh drugs to suppress their sexual desires... oops, sorry, this was the 50s-60s! Nobody had any REAL feelings back then!

The thing is... the times the courtroom dramas really are great is when they go totally over the top. When Perry would zero in on some poor schnook who would be lying through his/her teeth, and then say, ""But you DID know, Mr. Smith, because..."" or ""But you WERE there, Miss Martin, because..."" or ""But that IS what you wanted us to think, Mr. Bell, because...""

Perry always had everybody's number and it was a joy to see him expose people in the last two minutes of the show. But unfortunately, this compilation (which is much shorter than the first season) seems too relaxed, too contrived, too controlled.

Here in season 2, the characters have settled down a bit (although Perry is not above a bit of sharp practice), Perry and Tragg seem to have made up, and the puzzles are rather more difficult.  In Season 1, I could often see the answer ahead of time, but here it's usually a surprise, at least until the trap is being sprung.

There are only 15 episodes this installment but every one of them has some good drama. Some of them are Gardner's material including one them being his more twisted novels being adapted to TV here on the Balfour estate.

The technology is old, & a lot of the stuff is old hat, but there are some legal wrangles in some of them that teach the viewer legal terms like tort. This is a solid set which any Mason fan will enjoy. Sadly it appears CBS still has no extras to offer with any of these.

Each show is full length, & this time they menu screen is silent so you don't have to listen to the suspenseful theme until you actually start a show. There is a play all option & disk 1 features a preview of other future CBS offerings of some shows like CSI to come. The preview is short & very much a teaser.

This set is about Mason, & 1 show even has an Inquest instead of a trial for a change of venue.  There are several guest stars that are known for other work they did on tv later & movies earlier. This set wets my desire for Part 2 of season 2, hope it is coming soon.",1184284800,,1169,4.0

I not only watch the shows but read the books, just recently finishing The Case of the Caretaker's Cat.

Great TV from long ago, and for me growing up in the 1950's, it's fun to revisit a world of cars, clothes, and people that other than in these shows, no longer exist. Perry and the gang are than actors and in many ways seem to have become our welcome friends.

2790066,5,B000O59A52,"Perry Mason - Season 2, Vol. 1 picks right up where the last set left off.
Contained herein are 15 episodes from the second season.
In my humble opinion the first few seasons of Perry Mason were the best of its run and this set doesn't disappoint.
There's plenty of great noir drama and courtroom action.
Needless to say, Perry's client always gets off the hook!
The quality of the prints used for the transfer and the transfer itself are excellent.
My only complaint is that I feel the entire season should have been released in one set.",1182902400,,538,4.5
2790067,5,B000O59A52,"One of televisions' most entertaining and popular series enters its second season on DVD with this great release by CBS Video.

Raymond Burr is Perry Mason and he imbues each performance with his special combination of toughness & sophistication.  Along for the ride are his sidekicks, the ever beautiful Barbara Hale as Perry's confidential secretary Della Street and the constantly smoking William Hopper as the well informed private detective Paul Drake.  The opposition is played by the formidable William Talman as the constantly losing DA Hamilton Burger, though he somehow keeps getting re-elected along with the aged beyond all comprehension Ray Collins as the constantly passed over for promotion Lt. Tragg.

Less is implied about Perry & Della's personal relationship, but overall the episodes are better and have more snap in the writing. The episodes look very sharp, almost ""too"" sharp in a way since many of the scenes involve a technique called ""deep focus"" where characters are both in the foreground and background and inevitably we see a blurry Perry or client while the judge in the back is perfectly in focus.

This set has only two DVDs with 15 episodes total as opposed to the previous sets that contained 3 DVDs & 19 episodes each. And the menu pages are the same, featuring promo photos of the cast, though without the Perry Mason theme playing in the background. You can also play all the episodes on each DVD, which is nice if one episode doesn't satisfy your ""Perry fix"". And in a very tiny, but nice touch the curser is in the shape of a judge's mallet.

And while we still have no extras (not surprising I suppose given the age of the series), we do have original airdates of each show printed with the episode description.  The back cover of the box is also nice indicated that both Raymond Burr & Barbara Hale's Emmy wins for that year.

For any fan of the series I heartily recommend this set and give it the full five stars.  But I do hope that someday we get a few extras, even if they're just old commercials for the series.

Tidbits:

- Some interesting math is used in ""The Case of the Sardonic Sergeant"".  The character Ricky Stevens was apparently a ""stripper"" while living in Manila (Philippines). Yet her age as revealed by a character on the witness stand along with the date in which she left for America would mean that she was 15 or so at the time...e[...]

- Perhaps due to the complex set-up of the murder, ""The Case of the Perjured Parrot"" does not have a trial, but a Coroner's Inquest run by Edgar ""Uncle Joe"" Buchanan.  Needless to say, the explanation of all the events is still pretty wacky.

- ""The Case of the Borrowed Brunette"" uses the same exterior footage of an apartment complex as Season One's ""The Case of the Long-Legged Models"" where the murder happens. Furthermore, the victim in both episodes was played by the same actor Joe De Santis.

- In ""The Case of the Glittering Goldfish"" we see a number of camera zooms and a very interesting tracking shot where we enter the courtroom to see Hamilton Burger question a witness that lasts a good minute before it dissolves to another shot.  That episode was directed by Gerd Oswald who later became associated with ""The Outer Limits"".

- In the same episode, Lt. Tragg compliments Della to the point where he almost...well, we can imagine the rest.",1182643200,5,3357,4.699658703071672

8182920,5,B000O59A52,"This is a series of programs based a character in the writings of Erle Stanley Gardner. The CBS TV series stretched form 1957 through 1966.

Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) is a defense lawyer who is always thought of after it is too late for him to save the defendant from being accused of murder. Supporting Perry is his trusty more than friendly but professional secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale). And their trusty and sneaky privat investigator Paul Drake (William DeWolf Hopper, Son of the actress-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper). On the other side of the courtroom is the district attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman) assisted by the not so neutral Homicide Lt. Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins).

You wonder how they get away with manufacturing evidence and the defendant usually has foot in mouth. Then there are the signature courtroom demonstrations.

Be sure to re-watch these programs as you can then see at even in TV programs they can sprinkle in subtle clues.

The was a mad magazine mock that had a boy scout immediately confess from the back of the courtroom upon seeing Perry mason.

Many of the subsequent programs allowed many TV actors of the time to become different characters and even replace the Burger and Tragg characters. You find yourself not only trying to outguess Mason but also saying ""Hey I saw that actor in...""

Even though the characters are from Erle Stanley Gardner the actual programs are written by many different TV writers of the day.

I have on occasion read some of the Erle Stanly Gardner Mason's and they are closely related. The TV version has a few less characters and has to write in some of our favorites.

The DVD's themselves usually have four episodes with a glaring lack of the extras that are so popular nowadays. The plus is that there are no advertisements.",1507852800,,1818,4.87987012987013
8182921,5,B000O59A52,"Perry Mason defined criminal defense shows, and what it accomplished has never been equaled, let alone surpassed. There are two reasons I say that. Although shows like ""L. A. Law"" or ""Boston Legal"" were engaging and fun, most of their charm involved the soap opera, not the law stories. Perry Mason had no ""continuing story"", as was the case with most TV series of the era. Each show offered an interesting murder mystery, normally giving the viewer enough clues to solve the case as Mason does. Second, there has never, before or since, been a legal show where the courtroom law was presented more solidly. Even ""Law and Order"" at times presents some absurd law, along with direct and cross examination sequences that wouldn't actually impress anyone in a courtroom.

The acting in the Perry Mason series is superb. As was the case for a lot of TV series which started in the 50s, most of the cast were veteran film performers. Even the guest stars are rock solid, offering a mix of veteran talent and young up-and comers who would go on to make major names for themselves.

The complex and entertaining relationships between the main characters is another element that made the show such a success. Perry Mason, Della Street, and Paul Drake are given a definite sense of relaxed comfort as friends. Even though Lt. Tragg is always an adversary, once the case is over Tragg and Mason share grins and a feeling of mutual professional respect. Hamilton Burger, the DA, is constantly frustrated and infuriated by Mason's tactics. However, even Burger and Mason share friendly moments at times during the series. And when Burger himself ran into a legal problem on a couple of occasions, who did he go to?

The TV series is based on the most popular series of lawyer/murder mysteries books in history. Erle Stanley Gardner, himself a talented lawyer, wrote enthusiastically received mysteries for almost forty years. In this second season, some of the shows are still loosely based on actual novels, such as the very surprising ""Case of the Caretaker's Cat"". Perry Mason TV shows, much like the novels themselves, are very even. Although a few shows stand out, I never saw what I considered to be a stinker.

If you are a long time fan of the Perry Mason series, you can buy this presentation with confidence. Not only does the transfer to DVD make this show look great, but a few minutes of footage are included on each show that probably have not been seen since the original run. Subsequent showings on local or cable channels normally had a few minutes chopped out to get more time for commercials.

The pricing on this series has been reduced dramatically over the last couple of years, making it an even better deal. Obviously, unless you find yourself always bored by black and white TV shows, or shows with more ""old-fashioned"" moral sensibilities, I can highly recommend this series to you.",1503360000,7,2896,4.7955911823647295
