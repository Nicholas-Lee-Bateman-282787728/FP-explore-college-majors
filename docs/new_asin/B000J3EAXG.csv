8148873,5,B000J3EAXG,"This animation is based on a Japanese adult computer game. And as such, there are some unnecessary scenes, settings and characters. But the main story is so good, that I can just forgive them (rather, ignore them). Those are...
1) An unnecessary sex scene at Haruka's house: Probably this is even illegal in some countries, but perhaps not in Japan? I do not know. Anyways, I think the main story could perfectly have the same impact without this.
2) Unnecessary two girl characters in the restaurant.
3) Haruka's sister has feelings for Takayuki.
4) The bad guys who tried to inebriate Mitsuki.

So just ignoring those above, I focused on the main story. As I get old, I realise how important time is to us. This animation is all about time and love. People literally change as time passes. I think the current ""I"" is not the same person as the ""I"" 10 years ago. Probably about 80% the same, but not exactly the same. So if you and your lover live on a different time axis, then even if your lover is right in front of your eyes, what you see is a reflection of an image that no longer exists. Haruka's these last words sums it up: """" (A happy... dream... it was.)

If you can understand Japanese, I seriously think you should watch it in Japanese. The theme songs are all composed and sung by Kuribayashi Minami, who is also the voice actress of Haruka. What a talented person. She has such a sweet voice, can compose songs, and sings them well.

I highly recommend people should watch this animation.",1426636800,,1503,4.498168498168498
8148874,5,B000J3EAXG,"I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I bought this series b/c the art on the box was pretty. You're probably thinking, smooth move dude. You're darn right it was. Rumbling Hearts is great. This is one of the most heartbreaking animes I've ever watched. It is about a group of four friends. just as the main character, Takayuki, and one of the girls, Haruka, start going out Haruka is hit by a bus and is thrown into a coma that lasts for years. After a very long bought with depression and drinking Takayuki's heart is being healed by Haruka's best friend Mitsuki. Mitsuki takes care of him and essentially saves him from a very sad ending. As feelings start to bloom between Mitsuki and Takayuki, Haruka wakes up. What do you do when your first love who you thought was dead and the girl that saved you from misery are both there and ready to be with you forever. Takayuki is thrown into a world of confusion. There's no way for everyone to be happy.

I was very touched by this story and I think it's a must see for any anime fan, of a more mature age. It starts out looking like a high school romance series, but quickly turns into an adult story. About everyday life and learning to live with grief. There is nudity, sex, and a lot of heavy and emotional content. It made this grown man cry. I can't imagine what kind of toll it could take on a tender hearted female. But it ranks up there with the best anime dramas ever! My only complaint is the length. I wish that it had went longer. It's amazing that they were able to develop suck strong characters in the 14 episodes that it ran. This series can be summed up in 1 word very easily...WOW!",1356220800,,1653,4.298076923076923
8148875,4,B000J3EAXG,"I'm glad I had bought this on sale when I did ($5). The Rumbling Hearts Starter Set, you think it'd come with something more, but all it happens to be is just a large boxset with one dvd (volume 1), 5 uncut episodes. Do not buy this at full price, as it is not worth the $40. 1/3 of the box is the space for the dvd, while the other 2/3s is just a fill in that tells you what the box contains...

Still, great anime, just the Starter set is only worthwhile when it isn't $40.",1349136000,,475,3.8969072164948453
8148876,5,B000J3EAXG,"I first came across RH by downloading the 1st episode. My thought on this series is very well done in the carther interacation. Yes, this is a cartoon, but at times I thought I was wacthing a TV drama. All the carters come off as realistic.",1313020800,,240,4.239130434782608
8148877,3,B000J3EAXG,"This is a decent drama worth watching maybe once if you're into the genre.  I feel the other reviews went overboard on their praise and am writing this to give some balance.  The main character, Takayuki, is nearly, if not on the same level as Shinji from Evangelion as far has how much he incessantly cries and mopes about throughout the majority of the series.  The whole ""girlfriend in a coma"" (Coupland anyone?) story arc is beaten over and over like a dead horse throughout the entire thing and could really use a change of pace about halfway through.  Instead we watch all the characters be miserable for several episodes as they self destruct.  I do enjoy a good dark drama anime but this was an overdose, the saving grace of this series for me was the two co-workers Ayu and Mayu who manage to shine some light into this wholly repetitive and dreary series with their comic relief.

Aside from my frustrations with the story the soundtrack to the series is entirely forgettable.  The animation is good and consistent throughout the series which is definitely a plus.  The character designs are pretty generic but fit the series well for the tone it tries to set.

If you consider this to even possibly be the best anime ever or even a 5 star (perfect rating) anime I can't help but think your anime experience has been limited to reruns of Dragon Ball Z and Pokemon, I mean honestly...what have you been watching that this is one of the best?  lol fanboys, your hatred only makes me stronger!",1167350400,3,1500,4.584269662921348
8148878,5,B000J3EAXG,"You know how all the big money movies are the ones that have the spectacular car chases and big space explosions, but the movie that always wins the best picture Oscar is the lesser-known thoughtful and touching drama?  That's what Rumbling Hearts (Kimi ga Nozomu Eien - or The Eternity You Desire - to those who know it better by it's Japanese name) is to anime.

This anime starts out as a typical slice-of-life anime: Haruka, a shy girl is prodded by her friend, Mitsuki, and eventually asks out the guy she likes, Takayuki.  The two start out rocky before the guy takes a deep breath and truly discovers that he loves the girl.  However, that's where similarities with other anime in the romance drama genre end.

Haruka is involved in a car accident and thrown into a coma for 3 years.  Takayuki, who blames himself for Haruka's involvement in the wreck (he was late to a date when it occurred), gets thrown into a deep depression, and is only drawn out by Mitsuki who decides to pursue him herself, though she is also tormented by the accident and blames herself (she was a major reason why Takayuki was late).

When Haruka wakes up without realizing 3 years has passed, Takayuki is forced to choose between his past - Haruka who he loved and cared for while she was in a coma - and his present - Mitsuki who was finally able to break his depression.

This volume contains the first 5 of 14 episodes in the series.",1163980800,19,1420,4.476744186046512

Meet Haruka, Takayuki, Mitsuki, and Shinji four high school friends who futures seem bright that is until an accident leaves Haruka in a coma. Takayuki, couldn't forgive himself, and to everyone around him it seems he is determined to follow Haruka into a comatose state. Mitsuki dedicates her life to taking care of the tragic young man, and the pair fall into a relationship shadowed in guilt.

Haruka awakens after three years, and everyone is made to promise to pretend no time has passed at all. Torn between his unhappy real-life relationship with Mitsuki and the past high school romance with Haruka, Takayuki feels the tiny silver lining left in his life being mercilessly and methodically stripped away
