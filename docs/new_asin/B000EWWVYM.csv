2542685,5,B000EWWVYM,"I have worked out with Lindsay in her AM bootcamps for three years and love it!! When Lindsay told me about this DVD I thought I have to try it and you know what it is AWESOME. Lindsay's Moms into Fitness Exercise Series is the only series that will guide you through each trimester of your pregnancy and post natal. The DVDS are challenging for beginners and advanced woman. Lindsay is very knowledgeable about the working out aspect of pregnancy as well as the nutritional aspect. During the programs Lindsay always makes modifications for the exercises (i.e. something hurts or is too difficult.) Lindsay highlights in her videos the importance of exercise and nutrition before, during and after pregnancy which is key to a healthy pregnancy. I would reccomend this DVD set to anyone pregnant or not. My youngest child is one year old and I find it very motivating and difficult!! Two thumbs up.",1152748800,6,898,4.8
2542686,5,B000EWWVYM,"This DVD set is the best, I am so excited to beable to use the post-natal bootcamp after my baby arrives.  I am now starting the 3rd trimester DVD and always look forward to working out.  It is not a chore but something I look forward too.  Not only is it helping prepare me for labor and keep in shape, but I also am able to feel comfortable knowing that everything we do in the workout is safe for me and my baby at this stage in my pregnancy.  I also love the Q&A at the beginning because it helps answer any safety issues I may have reguarding what is ok for me to be doing.",1152144000,4,578,3.956896551724138
2542687,5,B000EWWVYM,"I'm in my 11th week and, as any pregnant woman knows, my body is in a total state of upheaval!  I'm tired, my breasts hurt, I'm moody and I want to eat ALL the time.  The only thing that is keeping me grounded and out of my ""fat jeans"" is the 1st Trimester DVD.  The workout pumps up those endorphins - improving my mood and keeping sleepiness at bay.  The best part of this set of DVD's though is that they are especially made for where I'm at in my pregnancy so I know that it's safe for both me and my baby, which is the most important thing.  I can't wait for next week - Trimester 2 DVD, here I come!",1144108800,3,605,3.9262295081967213
2542688,5,B000EWWVYM,"Attention MOMS: I strongly urge anyone in the market for a pre/post natal video to purchase Lindsay Brin's DVDs.  I am a working mother, and just gave birth to my 3rd child.  I have ordered and used various other pregnancy DVDs in the past, but this collection has truly proved to be AMAZING.  Lindsay Brin's workout sessions are dynamic, fun, easy and thorough.  She is so fun to watch, and makes you feel motivated.  Do not waste your money on any other pregnancy fitness DVDs, this is it!!!",1143763200,4,493,4.556818181818182
2542689,5,B000EWWVYM,"I have been doing the boot camp video and it is really working.  I love how you can mix and match to make different workouts, so you're not doing the same thing over and over.",1143763200,3,175,4.0
2542690,5,B000EWWVYM,I have been doing the Trimester 1 DVD for the past couple weeks and I absolutely love it!!!!  Lindsay Brin's videos are uplifting and exciting.  She doesn't make exercising a chore!  I can't wait to start Trimester 2.  I don't have too much longer!  Lindsay Brin makes exercising fun with a different DVD for each trimester.  I also plan to get my butt in shape after my pregnancy with the boot camp DVD.  If you don't have the Lindsay Brin Complete Pregnancy Fitness Program you MUST get it now.  It is a must have!!!!!,1143763200,3,520,4.457446808510638
2542691,5,B000EWWVYM,"Wow!  Lindsay is cute and likable.  The cardio moves are more difficult than I expected, and are challenging in a positive way.  Combining cardio and strength segments make it easier to do all aspects of a good workout at one time, and I actually feel as if my muscles are getting stronger, rather than just being maintained.  The Yoga is wonderful.  I have tried other Yoga videos (not rated for pregnancy) before, and even the ones labeled 'for beginners' were too strenuous for me, so I was concerned about that - but Lindsay's yoga segments actually relax and revive me.  I definitely recommend a yoga mat for stability.  I really look forward to using this series throughout my pregnancy and post-partum.  My only negative is that I would have liked to see more pregnant women in the videos, rather than only Lindsay who is not pregnant.",1173830400,7,842,4.719178082191781
2542692,4,B000EWWVYM,"I just FINALLY started doing the 2nd trimester video and I REALLY like it. I needed something fast paced and upbeat but not too fast paced for an out of shape pregnant woman! I love Workout #2 on the 2nd trimester video best so far. And I also REALLY like the Yoga section on the 2nd trimester video. I've started doing it every morning because it feels so great to get all stretched out first thing. These workouts are very well-paced and geared towards the pregnant lady with a belly. I would definitely recommend these videos to any pregnant woman. Yoga is GREAT while you're pregnant, and is supposed to help you prepare for labor & delivery so give it a try!",1167868800,6,663,4.442622950819672
2542693,5,B000EWWVYM,"I love Lindsey's workout DVD's.  I have been an OB nurse for 12 years and I know from experience that the healthier Mom is, the healthier the placenta will be, which means you'll have a healthy baby.  Moms who exercise also have less chance of getting pregnancy induced hypertension (high blood pressure).  I tell my friends and anyone who asks me about exercise to use these DVDs (with their doctor's permission of course). All of them have loved these workouts. The exercises are perfect for pregnant women and you can go at your own pace.  I use the postnatal workout and it has helped get me in shape, even though my kids are older now. I can workout really hard, or if I am a little lazy I can take it kind of easy.  Lindsey is very good at explaining the workout, and I think it is the best workout DVD for pregnant women on the market.",1165622400,6,842,4.337579617834395
2542694,5,B000EWWVYM,"I bought the box set to stay in shape during my pregnancy and to get my body back after.  I have used Lindsay's 1st and 2nd trimester videos and now I'm on to my 3rd.  It really helps how she breaks everything down, so it's easy to follow.  She keeps reminding you to go at your own pace and she gives you alternatives of different ways to do the exercise.  I feel so healthy and fit, and I'm in my last trimester!  Without a doubt I would recommend Lindsay and ""Mom into Fitness"" to any mom, expecting or post natal!",1164758400,3,517,4.13
2542695,5,B000EWWVYM,"For a moderate exerciser, this is the closest video I've found to the ones I did before I was pregnant.  When I do have the energy, I want something more than just yoga or leg exercises.  This video allows you to choose your own level and pace, but gives you a good workout.  I like that there are two workouts on each DVD, because I get bored quickly.",1162598400,8,352,4.147058823529412
2542696,5,B000EWWVYM,I absolutly love this series. Through out my pregnancy I have had a low weight gain (the average weight gain as required by my dr.). Got a much needed boost of energy by working out to the programs on the Dvds. And worked my way back from a couple of pulled muscles in my back due to my pregnancy with the help from the yoga sections of these DVD's.  The best part about them is that there is one for every trimester of a womens pregnancy. I think these Dvd's have actually made this pregnancy easier on me by walking me through different excerises geared toward what I am going through.,1162598400,6,587,4.288288288288288
2542697,5,B000EWWVYM,"I really enjoyed 1st Trimester workout 1 and 2.  It gave me a lot of energy and challenged me in a good way.  I like that she continually reminds you about your intensity scale.

2nd Trimester- great workout.  There are 3 different workouts (each 25 minutes) and 2 levels I can follow.  I usually follow Lindsay, but when I am tired I watch the pregnant woman.

3rd Trimester- looks good.  I haven't gotten there yet, but it as 3 different workouts and 2 levels to follow (Lindsay or the pregnant woman).

The 1st DVD has an AB workout without lying on your back.  I think this is a great option since my Dr. told me I could do abs without lying on my back into my 3rd trimester.

Highly recommend this one!",1162598400,6,707,4.287878787878788
2542698,5,B000EWWVYM,"I used the whole set and am now on the Post Natal Video and my body is coming back quickly!!  This box set had everything I needed for my pregnancy.  Each trimester video has several workouts, plus a yoga section. It is challenging enough for the days that I felt like my old self, and has plenty of modifications for the days that I felt tired.

One of the best features is all of the back exercises and care that the instructor gives to make sure your back is supported in the third trimester.  She also incorporates kegel exercises.  I always read about how important kegels were but never remembered to do them.  With the videos my workouts changed as my needs changed with each trimester.  There are pregnant women doing the exercises in the videos.  This helped me realize that my growing tummy did not get in the way as much as I thought it would.  By the time my third trimester came around, I knew my body was ready for delivery and felt like my body still belonged to me, rather than a victim to pregnancy.

I did not use Lindsay's videos with my first child, but did with my second and there has been a HUGE difference.  I had more energy, knew how to care for my core with each changing trimester, and gained around 10 pounds less this time around.  I highly recommend the box set!!!",1162598400,5,1295,4.35
2542699,3,B000EWWVYM,"I just bought this boxed set and have done the first trimester video.  (I watched one workout and did the other.)

ON THE POSITIVE

-Let me say first that she is VERY pleasant

-I appreciate the reminders to go at a comfortable level for myself.

-The setting is nice and calm

-She gives clear instructions

-She is easy to follow

-I also like that there are TWO workouts to choose from plus a yoga section.

ON THE NEGATIVE

-She doesn't DO a core workout with you but gives you suggestions on things to do.  I was bummed about that--I bought a video because I don't exercise by myself--I need that structure the video provides.  I also found out that I don't really like yoga.  It was boring to me--but I have never tried yoga before and I guess it is just not my thing.  (That's not her fault.)

-She also does have a tendency to bounce a little.  Obviously YOU don't have to bounce, but it is hard when she does and you are following her and the moves lend themselves to it.

-BUT my real complaint is that there are no pregnant women doing the workouts.  She could have had two women with her to show alternate moves.  It would have made such a difference.

-I still have the other 3 videos to do and I may love those, but the first one was a little disappointing.  I will probably continue to do my regular Denise Austin workout as long as possible --minus the few jumping jacks.  Or I may even look for something else.  It seems as though if you want to exercise (even in your first trimester) while prego you have to like yoga.  That's a bummer.",1162252800,4,1555,4.2827586206896555
2542700,5,B000EWWVYM,"I am impressed with this workout! Granted, I have only done the 1st trimester workouts, but I am truly impressed! I am a FIRM believer, so to speak, but even with the modifications, I really wanted something made for ME during the next nine months!

GOOD THINGS TO SAY: Lindsay is sweet and cheerful and totally NOT ANNOYING- which is a HUGE requirement for my workout DVDs! The workouts are actually WORKOUTS- they are great! Even the yoga is both relaxing and does some gentle toning! It's nice to have OPTIONS- I get so bored, so it's nice to change it up sometimes! Plus Lindsay is always throwing out little reminders to watch your Exertion Rate, which is great to help you remember to stay aware of it!

NOT SO GOOD THINGS TO SAY: I feel like she goes a little bit fast in some segments, particularly the lunges, but I just go at my own pace and don't keep up with her. Her form is *almost* perfect- she can be a bit bouncy with her rows, but as long as you are aware of that, you can be careful not to bounce so much. Lastly, if I were a beginner, I think I would have preferred to have more modifications demonstrated- maybe even have someone with her to do the beginner workout. Lindsay does show quite a few modifications, but I think more would be even better for beginners who are new to working out.

Overall, I strongly recommend this workout to pregnant women. I think beginners should be careful not to overdo it, pay attention to the modifications she shows you, and watch your exertion level. If you are already into interval training, this is the workout for you!",1156118400,8,1582,4.429553264604811
8115315,4,B000EWWVYM,"OK, so I'm coming back to revise my 3-star review to a 4-star review. Personally, I didn't like the first trimester workouts, but the second trimester workouts were awesome. I can actually work up a sweat during some of these, which is hard to do with a lot of other pregnancy workouts. Plus, they don't involve lots of special equipment (only hand weights), and you don't have to involve your furniture at all (thank goodness). Each trimester has two workout options & a yoga option. The workout options are meant to be done every other day, and you can do yoga on the days in between. Unfortunately, I found the yoga workouts to be disappointing (not challenging enough). I've been using Jennifer Wolfe's DVDs instead.",1482796800,,720,4.768
8115316,4,B000EWWVYM,"So far I am just using the postnatal DVD, but I am happy with it. It has a lot of different options, and has given me the option to work up to a more intense work out. I had pretty much never worked out a day in my life, but this was easy to catch on to.",1472515200,,254,3.473684210526316
8115317,5,B000EWWVYM,"I got this series when I was in my first trimester and was able to do every DVD throughout my pregnancy. I LOVED the workouts! They were geared just right to how I was feeling ad my body during each stage of pregnancy. I especially loved the yoga on each DVD, I could defiantly feel a difference in my body the days I did the yoga. I wasn't as sore and my back felt 10x better. I would reccommend Lindsay's videos to everyone. Be sure to check out her website as well as I have found lots of great info on there as well.",1270080000,,520,4.009615384615385
8115318,5,B000EWWVYM,"I am SOOOOO glad that I discovered Lindsay's Pregnancy Series!!  It is such a lifesaver!  With my first pregnancy, I gained a lot of weight and was always sick, sore, and achy.  With my second pregnancy, I discovered this series and tried to workout with it regularly.  It made a WORLD of difference.  Not only did I not gain excess weight, but I felt so much better!!!  The aches and pains went away!  I love that it's a serious workout.  All of the other pregnancy workouts that I've found don't even work me out or work up a sweat.  I love that I actually get a real workout with this, but still know that all of the exercises are safe for me and my baby.  And, on days that I'm not feeling great, I can opt to just do the yoga.  I'm now 3 months postpartum and already down to my prepregnancy weight, actually 12 pounds under it!!!  I feel incredible!  I now own a whole collection of Lindsay Brin DVDs- I'm a fan!!!",1269993600,,920,4.218390804597701
8115319,5,B000EWWVYM,I purchased this set when I was 6 weeks along in my second pregnancy.  I used them every morning thoughout my pregnancy. I liked that I wasn't doing the same routine every day for 9 months.  The change each Trimester was nice and kept me motivated.  The only thing I would have liked to have been different is that it would have been nice to have had a mother-to-be in each workout following along with Lindsay.,1226793600,,411,4.381578947368421
8115320,5,B000EWWVYM,"I loved this set of workout DVDs.  There is a lot of variety, and the exercises are appropriate for all stages of your pregnancy and for the post partum stages of getting back into shape.  The workouts are to the point, and you accomplish a lot in a minimal amount of time.  The variety helps prevent boredom.  Highly recommend to any busy mom or mom-to-be.",1209600000,,357,4.446153846153846
8115321,5,B000EWWVYM,"I ordered these DVDs near the end of my 1st trimester. I am a long time gym junkie, but I wanted a workout that would keep me in shape throughout my pregnancy without being too strenuous. So many of the DVDs I saw were yoga only, and I knew I wanted some aerobics and weight lifting, too. These DVDs give you all of it! Plus, there is great variety of workouts to keep you motivated. 2 aerobic/weight lifting workouts & 1 yoga workout per DVD. Also, you get a DVD for after baby. Lindsay is not always in perfect form and the set/recording is not the best I've seen, BUT she works every part of your body so that you know you're getting a great workout. If you like interval training (aerobics w/weight training) or are looking for more than just yoga - this is the workout for you!",1193270400,,782,4.25503355704698
8115322,4,B000EWWVYM,"I order this series of 4 videos at the very beginning of my second trimeseter and did the first trimester video for a week or two and liked it very much. It gets you moving but not so much that you are winded or exhausted after ward. I have moved onto the second trimester video and I like that as well. When I come home from work, I'm tired and the thought of excercising is the last thing on my mind, but when I remind myself that the video is only 25 minutes it gives me the extra motivation to pop it in and work out. I wind up doing the full 25 minutes of yoga afterward too and I feel more energized after doing both. It gives me a second wind. The only thing I don't like about the video is she tends to move a bit quickly for me, but I wasn't in terrific shape when I started the series. Thats the other thing I like, that I jumped into doing the videos after a VERY lazy first trimester and it wasn't difficult at all. I like Lindsay, she is cute but not overly so and she is dressed like I am at home - in comfortable workout gear - not cropped sportsbra and shorts which would just remind me that I am not going to have a flat tummy for some time! The images of the pregnant women doing the workout are a bit tiny for me and I'd like to see her doing the workout side by",1189814400,,1281,3.9118773946360155
8115323,1,B000EWWVYM,I exercise on a daily basis and had been working out using the FIRM DVDs for quite some time.  I purchased the set once I found out I was expecting.  I really did not enjoy the format.  The instructor annoyed me.  I haven't used the DVD set because of the format and instructor.,1185408000,,278,4.188679245283019
8115324,5,B000EWWVYM,"This is a pregnancy workout that will actually keep you in shape and fit (and the instructor is motivating without being annoying- hard to find).  I used these workouts during my pregnancy and am now using the boot camp video (which is the best of the lot).  Each of the trimester workouts have  multiple sections (yoga and aerobic/ interval training) that really work the muscles (so many preggo workouts are just useless for maintaining fitness).  The postnatal bootcamp video is set up so you can design your own workout to fit your time needs.  There is one basic 3 minute warmup and 1 yoga cool down.  There are multiple 3 minute core workouts (including pilates mat workouts and fitness ball).  You then match this with as many of the 10 minute (their are a huge number of choices) aerobics/ strength training segments to create anywhere from an 18 minute or more workout.  The 10 minute segments are INTENSE and range from aerobics, to interval training, to kickboxing (and more).  I just love this set!",1179878400,6,1010,4.758620689655173
