7882479,2,6305074127,"""Vampire Wars"" was a Japanese animation that was made in 1991. It features terrorist spy and master criminal Kousaburo Kuki as the hero in which he assists the French Secret Service in protecting a film star, Miss Vindaw. Unfortunately, a vampire is thirsting for Miss Vindaw's blood.
It's been awhile since I saw a violent anime such as ""Vampire Wars"". This anime is as if John Woo took helm of the gun shooting sequences and a B-movie screenwriter wrote the plot.
The violence goes from bloody vampires chomping on people, people getting bludgeoned or shot and so much more. Of course, you need your sexual moments and in this case, a messenger for the French Secret Service delivers Kuki money in exchange for his job but of course, before he can do his job, he must thoroughly give the woman a strip search to make sure she's not carrying any weapons and then of course one thing leads to another after that.
So, pretty much ""Vampire Wars"" is your average violent and sex-type anime with mindless action that feels there should be more to the anime but perhaps ended to quickly.
As for language, this is one of the rare anime DVD's where the English dubbed actually outdoes the Japanese dialogue. In the English dub, the character fits Kuki's character, always spouting off profanity, while the Japanese version is more subdued. Try watching the English dub with the subtitles on and you'll see how different the translations are. Also, there is a digital 5.1 audio track via English dub and the Japanese stereo track seems to be muffled. The voice acting is pretty good but I felt that the English dub for Miss Vindaw or perhaps it maybe the plot during a crucial part when Miss Vindaw finds out the truth about here, which I found kind of annoying.
As for the DVD, no special features, just the typical Manga entertainment trailers.
All in all, your average anime that people who enjoy sex and violence type anime will definitely get into.",1024790400,22,1945,4.706744868035191
7882480,2,6305074127,I bought this title and part of me is sorry I did. I had to watch it five times to understand it . The idea has promise . Personly I think there was too much unneeded violence. The dubbing was not the best and the animation  is alright. Things are too disoriented to make sense. Don`t buy it.,964915200,,292,4.0344827586206895
7882481,3,6305074127,"Vampire Wars could have been a very good anime' film, but the creators/producers simply tried to do too much with it.
The basic premise  of vampires actually being aliens in search of a special compound that will  alleviate their need for human blood is interesting.  However, the story  takes much too long in bringing that consideration to light, weaving an  overly complicated maze of sci-fi, espionage, mythology and some blatantly  anti-American propaganda (oh, well, who DOESN'T hate the CIA?).
The  animation is excellent, several of the characters are most interesting, but  there are simply too many holes for this film to hold together.  Much of  the violence, nudity and foul language is unnecessary, which detracts from  the effectiveness of the story.  The romantic involvement of the lead  characters works, but isn't developed sufficiently to really pull the  viewer in.  The biggest disappointment is the ending, which sets the story  up for a sequel but does little to give the viewer any sense of having seen  a complete story.  Rather, it feels like the end of one of the old  television serials, when you expect the narrator to say ""Tune in Same  Time Next Week for the Next Exciting Episode of . . .""
Will you  watch it more than once?  Probably.  Will you miss it if you don't?  Not  likely.",963878400,,1313,4.859090909090909
