It is a deeply British film based upon a very good play but this adaptation is a strikingly visual and artistic effort by my favorite British director, Mr. Peter Charles Hammond Hill (1923-2011).
He was an accomplished scenic artist and actor before directing and was instrumental in the phenomenon known as The Avengers TV series, particularly the first 3 videotaped seasons.
He declined offers to direct any filmed episodes because that format is so different, they lost the spontaneity and energy of the live recorded productions which I vastly prefer.
Spring & Port Wine is Hammond's only film unfortunately.
His masterful storytelling eloquence is evident throughout.
The story itself is very sophisticated, one of the most I've ever encountered. There are so many emotions and personalities in play here, so many human and social issues, and all are presented with a loving attention to detail by everyone involved.
The cast and all of their performances are superb, tremendous examples of craft and skill, magnificent talent.
I think this may well be James Mason's most relevant performance in a film, his character is complex and nuanced.
At times he reminds me of a British Archie Bunker, authoritative disciplinarian but unlike Bunker knowledgably cultured.
When the Real World seeps into his little British Private Idaho he resists defiantly until he realizes how it is affecting his family, he then relents and acknowledges how things really are and always have been.
He doesn't mean to hurt anyone, he is a worried man traumatized by an unfortunate childhood and he wants things to be good for his family.
It is so beautiful to see all involved come to an understanding and become an Authentic Family.

All of this is told with wonderful timeless comedy and drama, scripted very intelligently.
Peter Hammond's trademarks are meticulous character development and uniquely artistic visuals.
I think this may be his greatest work.

Spring & Port Wine is a lovely experience and I believe its director is very underappreciated.

This title is released by my favorite Region 2 distributor, the excellent OPTIMUM Classics Studio/Canal.
It is, as usual, beautifully restored including the Trailer extra.
Very rich color and high definition but DVD only as offered here at Amazon.
I will definitely repurchase this if found on Bluray or 4K!
