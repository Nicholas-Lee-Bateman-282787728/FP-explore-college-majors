2229444,2,B0007PALUC,"I have never seen the mini-series, so I am reviewing this DVD as a stand alone film.  Although I didn't think it was as terrible as some of the other reviews state, it was pretty bad overall.  The story has a lot of holes and nonsensical moments.  The overall character development is weak.  I never felt as though I really knew a single character in the film.  There was no major villian, although there were certainly some bad guys (slave traders).  I'm really not sure what the point of the film was.

The best part of the film took place on the slave ship.  That one part of this film really drew me in and made me shudder.  Those scenes helped remind me of how horrible a crime slavery actually was, and how we how lucky we are today.  Then, those scenes ended with an unintentionally laughable escape sequence.

I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but the slave ship scenes were enough for me to give it 2 stars.",1122249600,,924,4.376470588235295
2229445,1,B0007PALUC,"As a sequel to a great miniseries this is a disaster.  As a previous reviewer notes: How can this be a sequel if Shaka dies at the end of the original series.  And while the series takes its liberties with history, this sequel is a travesty that borders on the bizarre.  Shaka's capture by slavers was just one of a series of non-sensical historical b.s.  This DVD is practically unwatchable....we finally had to turn it off.  I could go on but life is too short.  The only saving grace is that Henry Cele is one magnetic actor.",1119225600,44,528,4.391752577319588
2229446,1,B0007PALUC,"I'm confused... How can this be the sequel to the miniseries, when he dies at the end of the miniseries?

this looks like it will suck compared to the original miniseries.",1118102400,,171,4.516129032258065
2229447,4,B0007PALUC,As my title states above this was released as a sequel to the original. The two people who reviewed this are wrong. You both stated this was cut down from 8 hours to 94 mins. This isn't even the same movie it is a SEQUEL. Please people lets get our information in order before we write something. All though this is not as good as the first Henry Cele still did a great job in it. This SEQUEL is about a slave- trader getting more then he bargained for when he crosses paths with Shaka. Who in turn creates a revolt and in the process much to the dismay of the slave- trader takes a white women hostage. The lovely Grace Jones also appears in this SEQUEL.,1117584000,2,655,4.165354330708661
2229448,1,B0007PALUC,"Shaka Zulu was a 5 part miniseries (each episode was 2 hours less commercials or about 8 and 1/2 hours long). A well done abridged version was out in video at about 5 and 1/2 hours many years ago.

This new version is 94 minutes. Don't buy it. Urge stores to throw it out, since it does not advertise the fact that it has cut 5/6 of the series, which was excellently acted and was about the most grand tv production ever made.",1114905600,6,426,4.132530120481928

It is hard to find that one. Maybe the truth hurts people. Actually there were TWO movies before this one with the same male actor. This one is watered down.,1471046400,,328,3.91044776119403

Nothing has changed. I helped put in the first oil in West Africa from 1979 through 1981 and lived on an Island in the mouth of the Congo River with a Village near called Soyo. At the time, Doctor Jonas Savimbi was the Shaka. He had a hundred thousand soldiers on his side fighting for a democratic Africa. We worked for Texaco who was partners with the Angola Government, staunch Communist. Dr. Savimbi sent word that there was a million dollar bounty on our pipeline, for us to go home.

2229890,2,B0007PALUC,"The film starts off pretty well, and goes downhill fast.  The lead actor was definitely well-chosen and does the best job that anyone could do, given the script.
The problems:
--As noted by other reviewers, there is far too much fiction in this 'historical""-type drama.  Just to give one example, Shaka was never captured by slavers.
--At convenient moments, Shaka has what only can be described as superhuman powers (like ripping iron chains apart with his bare hands).
--His character wavers between stoic/heartless and, well, PC sensitivity.
--The whites are too given to delivering moralistic speeches at the drop of a hat.  This not only gives the film a preachy tone, but it is out of character for the whites of the time.
--There are too many ""cute"" Walt-Disney-type scenes, such as the absurd dialog between the two white captives as they are being carried off to an unknown fate.
--The slave-ship captain is treated in bizarrely incompatible ways.
--The slave-ship captain is really a nice guy at heart--never mind that he is engaged in one of the most cruel and inhuman mass atrocities of modern times.  But hey, a guy has to make a living somehow, doesn't he?
--Characters are two-dimensional cardboard cutouts mouthing poorly-written and incongruous lines.
--In general, there is no real plot since all conflicts and issues get resolved in the most convenient way, rather than following any sort of real (or even dramatic) arc.
All in all, another film industry attempt to capitalize on a fascinating topic by totally perverting it.

Shaka Zulu was a very moving documentary of the time of slave gathering and transporting across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Americas in the early 19th Century.  The character development was enthralling.  I believe that the daughter's role was of paramount significance as she came from England in search of her father who presumably had been killed only to find that he was the highly regarded friend of Shaka Zulu himself and was still living.  I would highly recommend watching this movie from a historical perspective as well as a well written and well cast movie that will put you on the edge of your seats.,1429401600,3,677,4.860869565217391

2230090,2,B0007PALUC,"I really enjoyed the Shaka Zulu miniseries which featured this same cast. For that reason I was expecting more of the same. I got the same cast but I did not get the same enjoyment. This one was not worth much.

The story is of the furthering encroachment by the English and the Boers into the Zulu kingdom. Shaka is not a king to be trifled with and is in many way ""primitive"" but that does not keep him from sophisticated thinking as well. He is portrayed as a great leader of his people who can be violent but who is also willing and indeed eager to learn new things. So much they got right.

A great part of this story tells of Shaka being betrayed and captured by slavers. He vows vengeance but tempers that vengeance because of the example of an Englishwoman who shows him kindness. This part of the story is very simplistic and is dramatically flat. So too is most of the rest of the story. The one good acting job in this sequel is that of the title role. He tries to portray the complexity of the character. The rest are one dimensional.",1174435200,13,1046,4.277777777777778

Miss Farewell and Cpt. Prentice falling in love is nausiating. Yet, this tacky scene is trumped by the pitiful image of Grace Jones dead, sitting up with eyes open!!!!, because her man, Shaka Zulu, was away too long! The only highlights of the movie are the scenes where Shaka kicks butt and saves the day. The downside to that is the action scenes are so off the wall there's no point in saying it is based on a true story. Ex1-Shaka runs across Africa, on foot!, to kill a rivile king. Ex2-Shaka breaks the slave shackels from his wrists and takes over a slave ship single handed!

It's one of those you have to see once to tell people it's nothing like the real miniseries movies.

2230104,4,B0007PALUC,"Knowing nothing about the real Shaka Zulu I enjoyed this film. The photography is beautiful and the characters are interesting and the issues they confront are interesting. It does indeed have some soft spots, however.

From the start it seemed obvious that this could not possibly be history, so I just took it as a story, and I think this was the right thing to do and that is why I could enjoy it despite the soft spots and various unbelievable happenings.

Then I watched the director's commentary, which is really one of the better ones I have seen.

He made it clear that this was not history and was only a sequel to his TV mini-series in the sense that it was made later. It is in fact simply a thought experiment in ""what if"" and was intended to stimulate thinking about race relations and their sad history in Africa and elsewhere in the world. In that sense it was like a lot of science fiction, not intended to be taken seriously in any academic sense, but intended to explore ideas. The director was very passionate about what he was trying to do with this film and his views and this film expression of his views are well worth spending some time with.

Folks who are in the market for beautiful and thoughtful films will miss something if they are put off by the comments that the plot is unbelievable and a-historical. Also, try to overlook the soft spots here and there in acting. Even the treatment of the slaves on the ship is unrealistically mild compared to depictions in DVDs such as the Middle Passage. But Shaka Zula makes the point well enough.

What is real historically is that the practice of slavery was (and is) inhuman, and that it did have multicultural dimensions in Africa.

It may also be interesting to keep in mind that in too many parts of the world the laws against slavery are not enforced, and slavery does still exist (easily found with google).",1156723200,10,1887,4.519061583577713

The only film I could find in my area was this one, unfortunately.  Good thing I was able to find several good books because this movie - cut and pasted from a recent series - did not do Shaka, or the Zulu nation justice.  More or less it was a movie about David Hasselhoff and a romantic interest.  Their portrayal of Shaka was incorrect and the story was really ""Hollywood.""  Several of the books I checked out matched up - this movie did not.  If you want to watch a fantasy story about Shaka, look no further.  I'm off to find something more factual.  If your interested in this topic and want to read about it - look up The Washing of the Spears by Donald Morris, or The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation by John Laband.",1149033600,,847,4.185185185185185
2230106,1,B0007PALUC,"Why didn't they have Shaka fighting the Spartans at Thermopylae?

Such a scene would have been more consistant with any truth than this absurd account.

The trouble is that mythical accounts such as this become part of ""real history"" seamlessly due to the fact that no one reads anymore.

Shaka (Chaka) was an important man; he was not a noble man. Quite the opposite - he was a very successful mass murderer who, had he been white, would have been properly villified.  He never fought any white people and had contact with only a few white MEN whose real characters have been entirely fictionalized in this absurd account.

Shaka had no contact with Muslims or with slave traders (featuring Southern US accents no less).

Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this wretched movie is its subliminal undertone of anti-American messages.  Americans had nothing to do with the history of Natal or Zululand.  Why then the American accent for ""Wild Coast Slavers"" who never existed anyway?

The Zulus eventually (long after Shaka's brother Dingane had murdered him) had their troubles with the whites but they were either British or Dutch Boers; not Americans. It also must be stated that a state of continual tribal warfare existed in Southern Africa in the early 19th century.

If you want fantasy I suggest you buy star wars, not this totally made up ""history"".  No doubt this will be introduced into our decaying government school system as part of ""black history"" ughhh!",1135728000,20,1471,4.91497975708502

First of all Shaka was not captured by slavers. I don't know why this film depicts that. Is it because he was a majestic and dignified king and since the 1986 version showed that they had to put some stereo-typical depiction of Shaka being captured and defeated by the whites slavers? This sounds like a bunch of b.s. and I'm upset that they are showing this crap to students in high school. That is not what happened. If they want to show something for black history why don't they show the original 1986 version of the film. Even that had some false depictions in it too, but at least they had Henry Cele act like a king. It was his performance that made the movie believable and it brought backbone to the story line. Why he would reprise his role like this I don't know. But get the 1986 one please. It is way better.",1133136000,5,957,4.2349726775956285

2230110,2,B0007PALUC,"My review refers to the short version (about 90 mins) of the mini-series which, I believe, must have been originally much longer than the present one.  Whatever merit the original version must have, I confess that I don't know.  I watched this shorter one as stand-alone piece, and as such, the film is barely watchable.

This is said to be the sequel to the 1986 Mini-series, but let's forget about it.  All I can say is that Shaka Zulu is played by same actor Henry Cele, who is the only reason to watch this film.  While Shaka Zulu, the mighty king of Africa is talking about the future of the land with Captain Farewell (James Fox, brother to Edward Fox who was in the 1986 version), an English slaver Mungo (wow! it's David Hasselhoff!!) heads for the coast of Africa, with Captain's daughter Kathleen (Karen Allen).

These two sets of characters meet in a most incredible, and unconvincing way.  Shaka Zulu is captured and brought to Mungo's ship, on which you see bad things done to the slaves -- including one assaulted girl -- and somehow, well, just somehow, Kathleen falls in love with Mungo.  And ... should I continue?

The film is curious mixture of convincing locations (in Morocco) and unconvincing plot.  If the Michael Caine's 'Zulu' was conventional, it knew what it was doing with full of actions.  In here, you don't have many actions, and if we have one, it is marred by the contrived stort.

The only thing I find good about the film is Henry Cele's dignified portrait of Shaka Zulu.  Sorry, but that's the truth.",1123718400,31,1536,4.623616236162362

As a historical drama it fails, as it is history goes Hollywood. The script is totally laughable and nonsensical. The only good thing about the film, is that the late great South African actor, Henry Cele, is once again cast in the role of Shaka, to reprise his memorable portrayal of this Zulu warrior and king in the mini-series. The role of Lt. Francis Fairwell, originally played by Edward Fox in the mini-series, is, instead, played by his brother, James Fox. There, the resemblance to the miniseries stops.

As for David Hasselhoff, who ever told this guy he could act? Karen Allen, who is usually solid, sports an on-again, off-again British accent. Moreover, the romance between them strikes this viewer as false as a three dollar bill. The film is totally tedious. The only reason I gave it two stars, rather than the one star  this turkey deserves, is entirely due to Henry Cele's performance as Shaka.

8050128,1,B0007PALUC,"Direction: No real complaints, but fairly dull even for made-for-tv-fare.
Script: Bloody awful. This movie tries to tie in (somewhere?) with the well-made original miniseries. The storyline is pretty ridiculous.
Sound: Again, no real complaints.
Cinematography: Meh. The battle scenes are a bit too chaotic and the wonderful wide shots from the first miniseries are gone. The limited budget turned a massive Zulu army into a few tight shots of a Zulu platoon or two.
Acting: I saved this for last this time because it was well, terrible. The original stars from the first movie (that were left) do what they can. James Fox and Henry Cele pretty much know it's a crap script on a low budget. Cele's incredible portrayal of the Zulu King from the first miniseries is cheapened and blunted by the lame script.

Now we come to the reason for the one star: David Hasselhoff and Karen Allen in a pointless, unbelievable love story.  David Hasselhoff is pretty much a 1/16 trick pony. His greatest acting achievement is wearing more makeup than any other male actor in the history of film while arguing with a talking car. I couldn't even stand him in Baywatch Nights where he stretched those Baywatch acting chops as a Navy Seal turned beach lifeguard, turned private investigator battling werewolves, Vikings, mummies, and I think there was a ninja or two in there somewhere. How could ANYONE screw THAT up? At any rate this is a risky role for him as a white slaver who's introductory scene shows him wearing a leather trenchcoat that he retrieved from the trunk of KITT. I don't know if it is period-correct wardrobe but I do know you can't have him in a movie without draping some leather on him, or he just produces it naturally.

I like Karen Allen. Animal House. Starman, Raiders of the Lost Ark were a good fit. She has a Tomboy look and plays strong female characters while having big beautiful eyes and cute freckles. She is either horribly miscast here or Hasselhoff's craptacular acting can't exist in a vacuum so it starts devouring any talent near him. She bounces in and out of some kind of accent (what I call the Keanu bounce) and wears a white dress in the ocean without getting the dress wet. Her best scene is a compassionate moment with Cele on the slave ship. They both have the chops, but can't save this turkey of a film.

Oh yes and for some reason, Omar Sharif shows up to chew some film budget and develop his wardrobe for the 13th Warrior. I like the guy and there aren't many Egyptian leading men in film, but like Hasselhoff and Allen his presence is pretty pointless.
