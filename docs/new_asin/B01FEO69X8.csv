7749842,4,B01FEO69X8,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie and especially enjoyed the great performance of the young star, Alexis Rosinsky.  She did an outstanding job carrying the movie (at the ripe old age if 12).  We have 12 grandchildren and are planning to send the DVD to all of them but the oldest, an 18 year old young man.  I highly recommend this film to young people, especially pre-teenage and teenage girls, it's fun and wonderfully wholesome! It's very much like the family movies we grew up with in the '50's and early 60's.",1469836800,3,523,4.542553191489362

7749844,1,B01FEO69X8,"This is just another example of a cheesy independently made movie that received a high rating, probably by the movie's producer or his best friend, in order to influence it's purchase. It is a poorly made film with two dimensional acting, hackneyed plot, fake accents, and a ridiculous ending. I am really unhappy I wasted money on this film for my granddaughter who intelligence was insulted.",1469577600,,393,4.96969696969697

8760696,1,B01FEO69X8,"The best part of the film is the dance party, but the film overall is mediocre.  Also, why does the cover art have an actress and a brown horse who don't appear in the film???",1514073600,,175,4.0
