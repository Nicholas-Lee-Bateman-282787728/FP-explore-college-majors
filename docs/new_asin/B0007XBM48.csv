8053278,2,B0007XBM48,"Spectacular waterfalls.  Although, part of the enjoyment of viewing a beautiful waterfall is also hearing the sound of the water. The harmony of both the visual and audio creates the tranquility that gives one a sense of peace and serenity.  I assume that would be the intent of those who desire to watch a DVD like this.
 Instead of sounds of nature, water cascading, flowing, splashing or bubbling... you are given piano music. It actually became distracting and I had to mute the sound. I would have much preferred the natural sounds of the environment. Even wild birds would have been better.
 I also would have liked to know the names and location of these worldwide waterfalls. A simple notation would have been nice.",1179792000,4,723,4.806451612903226
