However, it is a shame that Warner Bros can release a print that is so DARK all the way,  that the film seems to have been filmed entirely at night and without the necessary light to be watched! If this was really done by WB, this company is no longer the quality company it used to be! This should a warning to people who are planning to buy WB products in the future!",1525564800,,431,4.070588235294117

8745269,1,B019HOVPPI,Very disappointing video transfer; very muddy and dark -- often the picture is more like a silhouette. Very mediocre story and cast. Not worth the money or the time. A misfire for Warner Archive not up to their usual quality of movie and transfer.,1460419200,,247,4.636363636363637
