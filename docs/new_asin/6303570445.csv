7850585,3,6303570445,"I purchased ""WWII - America at War: Show Business in War"".  It was good and showed some of the old Hollywood stars.  Two pieces of feedback: (1) It was a new or as new VHS tape and came packaged as a new tape but I had some tracking problems that I couldn't solve w/ my VHS player.  It lasted about 10 minutes in the middle of the tape and was stil viewable with good sound.  (2)  I also purchased ""Entertaining the Troops"" which was what I was looking for.  It showed more of the old stars of Hollywood actually entertaining the troops.  The ""Show Business"" tape shows more of the impact of the film industries during the war and less actual film footage of the stars.",1242259200,,669,4.261904761904762
