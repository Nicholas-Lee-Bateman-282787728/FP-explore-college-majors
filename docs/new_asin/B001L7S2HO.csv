8317528,1,B001L7S2HO,Amen to that! What some people would not do to make a quick buck. Recommend that everyone buys the original dvd's so that the artists can get the credit they deserve instead of some one sitting in their basements making illegal copies.,1451606400,,235,4.619047619047619
8317529,1,B001L7S2HO,would not buy anything that is said to be imported again. the quality of the product sucked and the picture on the front was not even the group,1362614400,,143,4.142857142857143
8317530,1,B001L7S2HO,"This DVD is a big time rip off! ""8"" of the songs are from the concert (ONE NIGHT ONLY) the quality is terrible to say the least. The last ""7"" songs are not even from this concert, the title (BEE GEES THE BEST OF & FRIENDS LIVE)makes it sound like they are in the concert singing with the Bee Gees and it is very missleading, the songs are from other videos that are on other DVDs, what a joke. I think it is fair to say that this is some kind of copie and not an offical release DVD. Live by request, One For All and One Night Only are the best Bee Gees live concerts. I hope this helps.",1253232000,14,587,3.9
