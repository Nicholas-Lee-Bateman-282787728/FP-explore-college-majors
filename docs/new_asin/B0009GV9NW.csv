8060663,5,B0009GV9NW,"This is a first DVD memorializing a concert sung by the great Bulgarian soprano, Raina Kabaivanska.  From beginning to end, it is superb!  Mme. Kabaivanska sings the most ambitions concerts most of us have ever heard.  The wonder is that as she goes from opera to opera, she never loses the artestry and intent of any particular aria.  If you love great concerts, this is one you will treasure.  Both maestro Bonavonta and diva Kabaivanska are artists supreme!",1256256000,4,460,4.846153846153846
