8677700,2,B00NFDLSR8,"If you like the opera, maybe you will like this production. After suffering through a different DVD as well, I conclude that I don't like either. Word is that this was Verdi's best for humor and characterization--but I guess you had to be there. I consider it unmusical, unfunny, difficult to follow, and not worth the time or trouble. I wish Verdi had stuck to writing good music with a recognizable tune.",1492387200,,406,4.652777777777778
