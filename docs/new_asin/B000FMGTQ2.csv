8124656,5,B000FMGTQ2,"This review is for the bluray, pairing Maniac (1963) with Die! Die! My Darling! (1965) aka The Fanatic. By contrast, the DVD reviews appearing for this Double Feature on Amazon relate to entirely different movies.

*** PICTURE AND AUDIO QUALITY ***
Firstly, even though this is a budget release with two movies sharing the same disk, the picture quality is excellent.

THE MANIAC: Never before has a movie about a blowtorch-wielding maniac looked so gorgeous - there's some film grain, which isn't a bad thing since it gives the monochromic images a sort of rich texture. The source print must have been very clean because it looks absolutely pristine, and is presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format. This movie is a pleasure to watch. The imagery is captivating, reminding me that black and white cinematography is an almost lost art form. In the realm of photography, an expert B&W photographer can capture essence and emotion of a character or moment better than most other photographers do in colour. The monochromatic images and texture of this movie did something similar - expertly drawing me into the place and period of this film. I wasn't expecting it ... but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience

DIE! DIE! MY DARLING: By contrast, this movie is shot in colour (in 1.85:1 ratio) and the print used for the transfer wasn't so clean. The image is still very crisp, clear, and not so grainy ... but there are dust spots throughout which become distracting. I realise that this is a budget transfer but surely the producers could have paid less than minimum wage to a trainee video engineer in some cheap third-world country (India, China, Bangladesh, New Zealand or Los Angeles) to use the Spot Healing tool in Adobe for a few days to fix this up. It would have made a huge difference. Fortunately, despite these momentary distractions, this movie's plot and memorable characters will quickly draw you back in.

Audio quality for both films is good - and is crisp and clear. Unfortunately I can't offer any meaningful analysis since I generally just play my movies back through the TV speakers and not through any fancy audio systems.

Although not specifically audio-related, its important to call out that (unlike the Hammer Double Features vol 1 & 2) THIS RELEASE INCLUDES SUBTITLES. This is an important feature for those of us getting on in years - or who live in small household shared with others who lack appreciation of classic Hammer films.

*** ABOUT THE MOVIES ***
Both films are psychological thrillers or horror - falling into Hammer's ""mini-Hitchcock"" category. Neither are graphic in any way

THE MANIAC:  This is the lighter of the two films. Sure, there's a blowtorch wielding maniac somewhere in the background, but much of the film is focused on the romance of a visiting American painter and a local French woman whose husband is locked in an asylum - and is then convinced to help him escape. A mystery then ensues when the plans don't work out as expected. Although its probably not the best in this genre, Jimmy Sangster's script still has some interesting plot turns - and the characters are all fun to watch even if none of them stand out for any particular reason.

DIE! DIE! MY DARLING: For me, this is the better of the two movies - and one of my favourite Hammer films of all time. It deals with an unsuspecting American woman visiting the mother of her deceased fianc. Something that starts out as mildly awkward rapidly descends into terror as the grieving mother proves to be a mentally unbalanced religious fanatic - holding her guest hostage. This movie fits into what's known somewhat derisively as the ""Psycho biddy"" genre ... but its a wonderful example with strong performances and an escalating sense of tension throughout. Sure, it only gets a measly 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes - but those negative ratings obviously came from talentless hacks masquerading as reviewers, and not from true Hammer fans.

There are a couple of reasons why this movies is so great.

Firstly, its very well written. The screenplay comes from Richard Matheson who gave us ""I Am Legend"" - adapted into the 2007 film with Will Smith, along with two earlier adaptations: Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price, and The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston. He wrote three film adaptions of Edgar Allan Poe classics for Roger Corman - resulting in House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), and The Raven (1963) - which were easily the strongest entries in Corman's Poe series. He also wrote another Hammer classic, adapting Dennis Wheatley's The Devil Rides Out  ... along with scripts for Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, and original Kolchak TV movie.

Secondly, there are strong acting performances. Stefanie Powers is terrific in her role, but Tallulah Bankhead's is the absolute standout. Peter Vaughan, Yootha Joyce, and Donald Sutherland round things out.

For someone who grew up in the 1980s watching shows such as Hart to Hart, STEFANIE POWERS epitomises the vision of a smart, glamorous, capable, and self-reliant woman ... and is certainly not the type to easily succumb to the machinations of a raving looney. Powers plays her part extremely well - she's believable, sympathetic, and a portrays a character who's strong in her own right. But its TALLULAH BANKHEAD who manages to steal every scene. Her performance is utterly unnerving and the stuff of nightmares - all delivered in a quietly spoken husky voice (reputedly the result of smoking over 100 cigarettes daily). This movie was Bankhead's final film and its clear to see that she was truly one of the greats of her time. Speaking of strong female characters, we also get YOOTHA JOYCE in an early film role. Although she has only a minor part in this film she'll be familiar to British and Commonwealth audiences as Mildred Roper who, with the exception Maggie Thatcher, might have been one of the strongest female role model in the UK of the 1970s and 80s. The males, Peter Vaughan, Donald Sutherland, and Maurice Kaufmann all play their parts well ... but its the females who rightfully dominate this movie.

In summary, this Hammer Double Feature comes highly recommended for anyone looking for a couple of classic movies, and to explore Hammer's offerings outside its better known gothic horror genre.",1522454400,,6329,4.8908582089552235

8124661,4,B000FMGTQ2,"Sure, I like my femme fatales as bad as possible, wicked even (cinematically that is, since I don't always want to in real life be constantly looking over my shoulder to see if some off-hand brunette is waiting to put a slug, or six, in me for some supposed transgression, or just because). And, again theoretically, I suppose I am as likely, maybe more likely, than any other guy to be ""swayed' by some perfumed request of said femme fatales to do a little  off-hand heavy lifting in the way of freeing them of some burden. But, damn, I would, and I will, swear on a stack of seven bibles or whatever holy book you want, draw the line at murder. No way, no way at all.

Well, no way except that just maybe I would consider that line of work if white shorts, white blouse, white bandana Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice gave me that second look that she gave John Garfield. And it is not beyond the realm of possibility that I would be tempted to tumble to some scheme Barbara Stanwyck had worked up in Double Indemnity after seeing that ankle bracelet come down those stairs. But really I am not build for that heavy lifting, and remember my drawn in the sand line against murder policy. So there is no way, no way in hell, I would fall under the spell of Carol (Hillary Brooke) in the film under review, Heat Wave (aka The House Across The Lake).

See, I don't mind a blonde or two for company, although I prefer brunettes, but I am always a little wary when they, those blondes, have that look, that you are going to tumble for me but as part of the package I have job for you look. And that job always, always involves some in the way a hubby to be cleared out of the way before she (and I, of course) can be really happy. Like I said I draw the line. I draw the line doubly because in this case this blonde is no big-hearted blonde out of a Dorothy Parker Big Blonde short story but an ice queen, a serious ice queen. Of course our skirt-addled, high-end bourbon -addled, perfume whiff- addled protagonist here, Mark (Alex Nicols), is smitten right off by this butterfly swirl. Worst as the story develops he actually likes the husband (likes him well enough to drink that high-end bourbon when offered).

Of course the story line here in this very B film, very B British noir, very B noir 1950s Hammer production, is as old as Adam and Eve. Maybe older. One young gold-digging wife with no moral compass (and frankly no apparent charms) is tired of older hubby, Beverly, and wants something done about it. And quick. Now today, here in America at least, thank goodness, she could juts file for divorce, make a hefty sum, and go on about her business with  the next six guys who come along. That, needless to say, would make for a very short noir, and moreover not satisfy dear Carol's lust for depravity. Enter patsy, yes, patsy, Mark who while allegedly out in the England country-side taking in the airs in order to write the great English (or American) novel seems to have nothing better to do that drink proffered high-end bourbon and fall under the  spell of our damsel in distress.

As with all these, as someone put it, divorce-noir style films the evil deed, the murder, is done (and done with some bravado by Carol) but as with all amateurs and non-professional career criminals this job gets so botched up and the suspects and motives are so apparent that the police can just sit around and wait for the guilty to step to the crime, and the rope. Our boy Mark was clearly not build for this heavy lifting and falls to his part in it after a few more bourbons (assumed to be high-end still although who was paying seems to be have been left up in the air.)  Lesson: guys, when some perfumed country estate damsel with ice in her veins gives you that come hither look, check the wedding finger, and get the hell out of there fast. Except if she is a foxy little brunette then maybe you can stop long enough to listen to her story. Enough said.

**********
The Gambler and The Lady, starring Dane Clark, Hammer Productions, 1952

Not all noirs are created equal as the film under review ample demonstrates. Some film like Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice stand out as A-One crime noir classics. This one is a very B film, very B British noir and as a very B Hammer Film Noir production. Why? Well, mostly it is the plot line. An ex-pat up from cheap street American gangster winds up nursing his wounds (after some American jail time) by controlling some sideline gambling action in London in the 1950s to keep him (and his ""staff"") in coffee and cakes. Along the way he tries to meet the British equivalent of the ""better sort"" (today's 1%, I guess) and seriously attempts to gain entry into that rather closed and cloistered society (just ask Queen Elizabeth who took up that heavy burden the year this film was born).

Naturally in a time when the royalty of England were not enthralled by gangsters, particularly from America or from continental Europe (unlike in the 1930s with their compadres Hitler, Mussolini and Mosley) this second- rate hood Jim (played by Dane Clark) from cheap street (who can't even tell the lobster fork from the salad fork, jesus, the guy is hopeless) is persona non grata. Well, except to a more democratic sort of lady (Lady, excuse me), and who happens to double as the on again, off again love interest for said second-rate gambler.

Of course in the gambling world like in the mainstream of capitalism the push for market share is relentless. Our boy runs up against a cartel that wishes to ""take-over"" his business. And they are not particular whether it is over his dead body or not.  Add a scorned woman (his dancer ex-girlfriend) that he dumps unceremoniously for Lady Grey or whatever her name was and this guy is in over his head. Jim best go back to safe America where the gangsters are learning business administration at Harvard and places like that.

The real problem with this one though is that part about our boy practically begging to get into high society in Labor-bound 1950s England.  Now if it was today, even here in America, with the hoopla over various royal entourages from the queen on down to the grandkids I could see it. But back in the 1950s when we cherished a thing called the American Revolution a little more and English royalty less the lash-up with American ex-pat gamblers doesn't work. No way, no way at all.",1344470400,,6425,4.493573264781491
