7999713,3,B0000D0YUQ,"If you can find this movie for rent, i would say rent it before buying,some of the love scenes were hot,but it's pretty much late night cable nudity.the story is about a device that can bring out sexual desires in anyone it comes in contact with. And of course it keeps falling into the wrong hands,and a lot of sex insues. PLOT SOUND FAMILAR? yeah i know,another movie based on ""MILO MANARA'S CLICK"" premise i think this one of five other movies like this. But if you like these kind of films this is your movie,it also stars Jacqueline Lovell(Sara St. James as she's also known)maybe that's why i gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1.",1140220800,10,636,4.444444444444445
