2613239,4,B000GI3KJ4,"Having the fireplace burning during our Holiday gatherings, along with the different music selections, made the day that much better!",1390089600,,133,5.7
2613240,4,B000GI3KJ4,Living in Florida and having a fire cracling on TV at Christmastime was enjoyed by all who visited us.  The ambiance and the Christmas music brought New England memories to all.  Loved it!!,1388275200,,189,4.696969696969697
2613241,4,B000GI3KJ4,We had it playing when we opened presents on Christmas Eve.  It was nice.  The grandkids thought it was cool,1359158400,,108,4.35
2613242,4,B000GI3KJ4,"You have the option of watching just with the crackling fire sound, or just piano, or piano and crackling fire, etc. but the music is all Christmas carols. I would have liked at least one track with general music. The dvd was received very promptly.",1356393600,,249,4.555555555555555
2613243,5,B000GI3KJ4,"This dvd has added so much to my holiday decor..it's just nice to have the option to turn the tv into a fireplace!  It actually makes the room feel warmer, even though I know this is just psychological.  But I like it!  It would be nice to have a ""repeat"" feature, so that the fireplace would just stay on until I turned it off.  But playing it again isn't so much of a hassle that I would deduct a star.  Great picture, great music..great purchase.  Glad I got this one.",1355529600,4,471,4.177777777777778
2613244,4,B000GI3KJ4,"I received a video like this 2 years ago and have used it at home and also in school to provide atmosphere and a warming touch to my home as well as teaching environment.  I teach music and when I teach Holiday Carols, I show this video while we are singing and it feels like we are singing by a fireplace.  The students love it!  I also use it at home to show on my tv upstairs while I listen to audio books and do needlework.  Some may think it's hokey.... I think it's a wonderful tool.  I don't usually play the recorded music.... I stick to the fireplace sounds and it's great!  I even showed it on my computer once when I was wrapping Christmas gifts in a room without a television.  It provided a nice atmosphere.",1295740800,2,720,4.173913043478261
2613245,5,B000GI3KJ4,I gave this as a gift to my mother. She just raves about it. She loves the different music selections and says it puts her in a peaceful mood.,1293667200,,142,3.9310344827586206
2613246,1,B000GI3KJ4,"This product is not what I expected at all.  If you want a plain DVD of burning logs, well here you go!  The title ""CHRISTMAS FIREPLACE"", cover picture and description made it seem like it was an actual Holiday scene, but it's just plain 'ol burning logs.  The only thing Holiday-ish about this DVD is the terrible music.  AND the box arrived broken in two different spots.  It won't even close.  Don't buy this one.",1291680000,,416,4.48
2613247,5,B000GI3KJ4,My parents living in a retirement village without a fireplace thought it was better than Aunt Pat's egg nogg. Aunt Pat was not happy.,1264377600,,133,4.583333333333333
2613248,4,B000GI3KJ4,"This year I had to sell a home that had a fireplace and buy one that had none. I really like having that old fireplace for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day so I thought I would look for a DVD that could simulate the look of a fire, at least. Many of them I saw were very overpriced for what you are getting - after all, they are nothing more than a continuous burning fire with maybe an option for music. Why charge over 10 dollars for that? I saw this one on Amazon and, even though there wasn't much information about it, I thought I'd take a chance on it. For under 10 dollars, this DVD fills the bill nicely. The screen shows a good close-up of a burning fire only (no other part of the room is seen) and the quality of the video looks good on my 45-inch TV (the DVD claim is that it is filmed in high-definition for 16:9 widescreen). You have a choice of several programs - just watching the fire (complete with crackling fire noises) or watching the fire with music. The musical programs come in 3 flavors - Piano, Celtic Harp, or Smooth Jazz and you can play the music with or without the crackling fire noise in the background. The musical selections are very nice - quietly relaxing. I especially liked the Celtic Harp as it gives you more unusual pieces - medieval and Celtic Christmas music you don't often hear while the other two selections are more the traditional Christmas carols. There are no vocal selections in any of the programs.

I might have given the DVD 5 stars but for one thing - you don't have an option to play the DVD in a continuous loop - all the programs, including the fire only selection, play for approximately 60 minutes then the fireplace screen goes back to the menu screen which displays a room with a Christmas tree (similar to the one displayed on the DVD cover) and the options menu. The DVD then reverts to playing the Piano Christmas program. It would also have been helpful to have included an insert that listed the names of the songs being played. Even though it's an all instrumental program, it would be nice to know what is playing when one of the seldom-heard pieces come on and you know you've heard it before but can't quite remember the name.",1261180800,26,2196,4.36919315403423

2613361,3,B000GI3KJ4,It was a nice touch to a neighborhood gathering but it just went off after a little while and that was a little mind boggling????? It did actually feel like a fire going off in a fireplace....but we had 68 degree weather outside so that wasn't the worse thing that could happen.,1482624000,,278,4.365384615384615

2613419,1,B000GI3KJ4,"Ok, so I'm confused.  Many of the other reviews seem to have received a different product.  Some mention piano, others mention being able to choose from different musical soundtracks, like Celtic harp, piano, or smooth jazz.  No such choices exist on the DVD I received.  You can choose to have the music, or just crackling fire sounds.  The music is pretty terrible -- ambient synthesizer fare.  As far as the video, it is indeed as described, just a fireplace. Maybe I'm being too picky but it is not even a very attractive fireplace -- kind of shabby.  It does NOT look like the fireplace on the cover.  The camera shot is not completely centered.  There are typos in the DVD menu.  Not a quality product.  Not very high resolution either -- I can see pixilation on the screen.  I bought this to play for patients in a healthcare facility -- I'm really glad I tried it out first, because I would have been embarrassed!",1481932800,,921,4.548780487804878

2613435,3,B000GI3KJ4,"Living in Paradise, where it rarely gets below 70 during the day, I miss having a fire at Christmas. So, I was happy to find a few videos on Prime featuring a fireplace and Christmas music. This one is not bad, as it features a nicely burning fire, but it does NOT have the crackling sounds of the fire, just piano music. Another drawback was that it appeared to be a loop- the image would flicker every now and then as it being reset. The fire doesn't change much and the flames sometimes look as if the playback speed was increased.

All in all, not a bad fireplace with Christmas music to watch on Prime for free, but if you are like me and want the sound of a fire as well, you'll probably want to check out some of the other offerings available.",1481760000,,750,4.208333333333333

2613438,4,B000GI3KJ4,I am watching all the Joseph V Micallef and this one is just a fireplace. I'm ten years old. This one I guess is for the people who don't have fireplaces so they can have one on their TV. I did not want to give this less than 4 stars because I liked all his other videos. This is just a 54 minute fireplace.,1481328000,,307,3.8125

2613446,5,B000GI3KJ4,"I LOVE this disc! There's three music options...Celtic harp, piano, or smooth jazz. I believe they all play for an hour each. I love them ALL!! The only downside is that there is no option to have it replay automatically, but that's a small price to pay, seriously. My kids loved when I put this on when they would go to bed so they could hear it while they fell asleep. And the fire is just beautiful, and great quality :). Definitely recommend this!",1419984000,,451,4.380952380952381

2613449,3,B000GI3KJ4,"The music options on this holiday fireplace dvd are generous. Viewers can choose Piano, Celtic Harp, or Smooth Jazz for an accompanying sound track. They all sound fine for background music, although I personally prefer just the sound of the fire (and I'll choose my own music from another source).

I was a little disappointed with the video quality; it is a bit pixelated. The flame itself is nice and full, but the flame and wood seem to never change through the video (gas fire?). Personally, I prefer a real fire - real logs, sounds, imperfections and all. This is a matter of taste. It feels more like being in a resort lounge than a cozy living room fire.",1411257600,,662,4.563025210084033
