is as bad or worse. The music is almost inaudible, and Nancy's vocals sound like they're coming out of a transistor radio.
Overall, I am deeply disappointed, in fact, for me, this is completely unwatchable and will be tossed into the rubbish.
I often times depend on Amazon reviews to assist me in my selections, and have found them to be very helpful with a lot of exceptional reviews.
It's very hard for me to believe that anyone could have seen this and placed a review without commenting on the awful quality!",1435968000,,612,4.5225225225225225

8424684,5,B004D2R1E4,"Nancy LaMott (although she'd been around for quite some time) was just reaching the point of
major stardom when she died (far to young). There are cds and a biography dvd available...and
now this to add to the collection of her admirers. The quality of filming is not the best but the voice is
pure. I am certainly happy to own it.",1345593600,4,331,4.354838709677419
8424685,5,B004D2R1E4,I fell in love with Nancy LaMott's singing when I first her singing on Music Choice.  Since then I've purchased all her CDs & DVDs.,1314662400,4,131,4.24
8424686,5,B004D2R1E4,"If you have ever listened to Nancy Lamott, you know what a dream her voice was and is.  The performances at Don't Tell Mama were a treasure and I am so thrilled that they are now available for all to see and hear.  I had the pleasure and honor of seeing Nancy live a couple of times at Don't Tell Mama and I will never forget it.  Her sound, feeling for lyric and voice quality are beyond anyone I ever heard.  She loved to sing and it came through in each performance not matter how ill she may have been at any time.  You will not be sorry if you purchase this DVD, it will become one of your favorites, especially if you love the Great American Songbook as I do.  No one interprets it as Nancy did.  She was one in a billion; I miss her always and am so happy we have these cds and dvds to listen to and watch.",1299196800,22,813,3.950920245398773
