8275749,1,B0001NIUWQ,i'm a huge fan of zep and this was not worth watching at all! not only was the video horribly produced the audio was just as bad! don't waste your time,1381190400,,151,3.903225806451613
8275750,4,B0001NIUWQ,"Although there was no direct input from the Zeps in the making of this DVD, it is still an interesting and enjoyable one to watch.  There was plenty of footage I had not seen before, and I loved the interviews with Lori Maddox and Pamela des Barres!",1313884800,,249,4.297872340425532
8275751,3,B0001NIUWQ,"There's no actual Led Zeppelin music, and none of the band members were actually interviewed for this exploitation docu. Only clips from other sources were put together from the band itself. Interviews with others such as Jimmy Page's 14 year old girlfriend from the 70s, Richard Cole, their roadie, and Carmine Appice, the drummer who was briefly considered to replace John Bonham, may have been done for this film, but I'm not sure. There is no audio of John Bonham or John Paul Jones talking, and only some barely decipherable audio from Jimmy Page makes it in here. This puts the story together, but I would imagine there is better out there.",1295222400,,646,4.776785714285714
8275752,3,B0001NIUWQ,"Decent if not mediocre documentary on a Great band,Most Zeppelin fans would probably be disappointed,documentary needed more to make it worthy,3 stars for the effort on a great band,but it's nothing to sneeze at.",1287360000,,212,5.264705882352941
8275753,1,B0001NIUWQ,"This movie has a few nice unseen shots of the band, and gives gen. history. It's cut and pasted together. Alot of coverage on the Band members girlfriends..  Not worth the money,  Get the One> Jimmy Page put together, it so much better!!  Or Buy> ""Rush in Rio"" !!",1143763200,3,263,4.326530612244898
8275754,2,B0001NIUWQ,"I enjoyed this DVD as a relatively new Led Zeppelin fan.  It was interesting hearing about the band and how they came to be, but I would have liked to have heard from the 4 geniuses themselves.  A little blurb here and there of past interviews was good, but it would have been better to hear from them present day.  We didn't get to hear any of their music and that was unfortunate.  A little bit of history to this great band, but lacking in content.",1129161600,4,451,4.209302325581396
8275755,1,B0001NIUWQ,"I expected something like those VH1 behind the scenes kind of rockumentary but was sadly disappointed. There was no Zeppelin music during the film. No live footage and no interviews with any of the band members for this film. The only footage from band members were from old news or other sources from 30 years ago. Although this should be included, they apparently had no cooperation from Paige or Plant for this film. If the artist decided not to support it, it may be for a good reason. There must be something better out there, avoid this film!",1128643200,5,548,4.6020408163265305
8275756,1,B0001NIUWQ,"THis so could movie was outragoisly boring....They talked about''Jeff Beck more than they do Robert Plant and all it is old english guys talkiin about crap, Sure it gives the story of zeppelin but there is no music by zeppelin , no live fotage but just pictures. I really did not like this film at all.",1093132800,32,302,4.410714285714286
8275757,5,B0001NIUWQ,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this DVD but when I watched it, I was pleasantly surprised. I provides a good overview of Zep's history from start to finish.
It starts by showing how the band was influenced (American blues) and then shows how the band was formed. The documentary then goes into the history that mostly all Zep fans know about.
Another interesting thing about the documentary is that it shows how the musical ""kings"" of the 60s (the Beatles) gave way to the musical ""kings"" of the 70s (Led Zep). Bonham even talks about going to see that Beatles and being annoyed that he couldn't hear them.
One drawback of the DVD is that it doesn't contain any actual Led Zep music. This is because the DVD is unauthorized but the content makes up for it.
I gave the DVD 4 stars because once the documentary gets to the point where Zep is an established band there is not as much attention to detail as there was at the beginning. Still, I did learn somethings about Zeppelin that I didn't know so the DVD was worth it. Besides, there is plenty of information out there about Led Zep from 1971-1980.",1087344000,44,1113,4.434146341463415
