8171755,2,B000MTEGCC,"If you remember the surfing tape they showed on the T.V.s at Scruples (the club in Waikiki a block from the strip)from 1999 to 2002, the fifth movie on this DVD is that tape.",1260057600,,174,4.147058823529412
8171756,5,B000MTEGCC,"These films are really fun to watch. Theres some cool interviews too. I really enjoyed the interview with Mark Richards and there is great footage of classic surf as well as some really wicked wipeouts. If you are a long boarder you'll enjoy TANKER RE-EVOLUTION, the third film on this disc and if you are a body boarder you will probably like I DON'T KNOW WHY the body boarding film. The music is very laid back and has the island feel but there are a few harder tracks. All Hawaiian footage. Pretty cool. Mahalo Dude!!",1204675200,,520,4.484210526315789
8171757,4,B000MTEGCC,"This five surf movies in one is a bargain.  Longboarders will enjoy the Makaha and Haliewa contest surfing.  Pipeline addicts will love the footage of Gerry and Derek Ho.  If you want to see a lot of Hawaiian surfing, this is the ticket!  It's da kine, brah.",1196467200,,258,4.425531914893617
8171758,5,B000MTEGCC,"Hawaiian Surf Stories is a collection of 5 surf films on one dvd. Most of the footage was shot on video but there is some film here as well. Shot entirely in Hawaii this film collection brings together exclusive footage of legendary pros and local favorites. The films are narrated by film maker Jimi Berlin who also conducts the interviews with many of the surfers featured (including a really nice casual interview with Mark RIchards).

At 3 1/2 plus hours the films are amost entirely  of surfing footage. The soundtrack is mostly of local Hawaiian bands which gives the whole thing a nice local feel but with a real professional look. The films are very enjoyable and the only downside is an occasional video glitch.

I have been surfing for nearly 20 years and it is great to see some films like this. I would recommend this for young and old surfers and those who simply enjoy seeing the beauty of the Hawaiian Surf.",1170028800,2,922,4.609756097560975
