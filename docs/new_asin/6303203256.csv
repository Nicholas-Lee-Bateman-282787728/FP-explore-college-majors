604461,5,6303203256,"Having previously owned this DVD, I ordered three more Concerts (Live). I just purchased my first VIDEO and I felt from the beginning, I had front row seats to the most unbelievable concert I have ever seen! It was magical! All with their own style and magnificent voices was a vision to behold! From the onset, it was obvious, The conductor and all Three Tenors were not only at their best vocally, but along with the audience, you FELT the enjoyment of their singing!!This video is a 'must-have'! I was mesmerized from beginning to end!! Bravo!!!",1043452800,7,548,4.71875
604462,5,6303203256,"I love this DVD!
Performed in Los Angeles in 1994 and of course features Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. Zubin Metha conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The camera angles are well placed, the switching is done appropriately and the editing has resulted in a beautiful production.
What I liked about the overall performance was the obvious magical chemistry that seemed to bind the performers, orchestra and audience from the very beginning. Early on, the singers must have gotten the unmistakable feeling of having the audience in the palm of their hands.
On an individual basis the whole night featured one great performance after the other: each tenor got to show off his unique voice and talent. One got the distinct feeling that a competitive atmosphere started to develop as the tenors seemed to try to outdo one another with each successive piece of music. The result was nothing short of a spectacular evening of entertainment.  Who won ""the battle of the Tenors"" is a purely subjective matter: but I have my own winner (which I'll keep to myself)
It appeared that the best time was had by the conductor Zubin Mehta: how could you not be enjoying yourself conducting a world renown orchestra and three of the worlds greatest opera singers before an enthusiastic and receptive audience. What more would it take to make one happy? Precious little I think!
All and all, a must have DVD for any opera fan. This concert will be remembered for a long time to come and deservedly so.",1040169600,71,1508,4.867704280155642
604463,5,6303203256,"Of course you've seen the Three Tenors before, but this is their best. The conductor Zubin Mehta is the catalyst that make this one particular performance stand out over the others. Music fans will cheer, and non-music fans will become fans of this genre after seeing this magnificent performance, thankfully captured on film for us to see for years to come. Bravo!",1027296000,10,365,4.903225806451613
604466,5,6303203256,"Was there in person and own the laser disc, etc plus have tapes of many others in different locations. For these types of concerts, the 3 were in best voice, the conductor followed them (not vice versa, Levine), the orchestra and chorus were perfect! If you can only get one or two, buy this first and Caracalla (Rome, 1990) second, even though it was the first concert - the 3 were a bit stiff and Jose not in as good a voice as '94. You can't beat hearing Domingo, live, in person, in an opera house!",994982400,10,502,4.239583333333333
604468,5,6303203256,"You've seen the Three Tenors in concert or on TV. But if you haven't seen their first concert in Caracula, Italy, you haven't seen the best. Voices are crisp, true to pitch and the Tenors are obviously enjoying themselves and the audience. Zubin Mehda somehow brought three symphony orchestras together with a sound that projects seemingly without electronics. The results are an amazing, probably never again produced, extravaganza. If you can find the DVD, buy it. This is one edition you'll want to keep for your grandchildren.",971827200,3,530,5.103448275862069
604469,5,6303203256,"Well i just saw the three tenors in concert last wedensday and the performace was wonderful.  I have had this DVD since it came out and it rivals the live performance i just experienced.  From Nessun Dorma to La  Donna e Mobile to My Way, this is an exciting piece of pageantry.  I found  watching each of the tenors try to outperform each other one of the great  aspects of this event. I recommend it to all opera fans and even people who  just like good music and good concerts",946857600,9,479,4.2555555555555555
604470,5,6303203256,"The best three tenors video out there...maybe the three could have practised a bit more but it all adds to the fun :)  Pavarotti is great whatever he sings, Domingo, completely awesome, Carreras, his high notes  softly ascending, almost moved me to tears. Many of the songs and arias are  sung light heartedly, and sound almost un-operatic - making them attractive  to even non opera-liking audiences. The 'La Donna e mobile' is a little  miracle of a piece, sung by all three of the tenors, all three heavenly  voices blending in one of the greatest arias ever composed!  As for the  ending of the aria...it's magnificent! The best ever, I'd recommend it to  anyone.",938044800,12,667,4.780701754385965

was going to be sung, the one where they were kind of playing around with it, but it was not even on the cd, but it was in the concert tho.  What a delightful cd concert this was, I play it often, and have the one with them doing Christmas songs as well, I will, of corse, play this one in a couple of months.  I absolutely love this concert.  All three tenors did a splendid job, but, I, of corse, love Pavarotti the best. Luciano Pavarotti will be missed by millions.  This is a ...must have...for Opera lovers.  Even if you are not really into Opera, I think everyone should have this beautiful cd..........IT IS AMAZING.",1319155200,,789,4.3493150684931505

605275,5,6303203256,"The 20th Century was blessed, not only because it produced some of the greatest tenor voices, but what is more important, the recording technology that preserves them.  In truth, previous centuries might have had equally fine tenors - or sopranos, basses, etc. - but we are limited to what we can now hear and judge by ourselves. Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras rise to the top in most lists of fine tenors, and this concert, held in Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles, is a prime example for why they enjoy such devotion and admiration.  Even though their other recorded concerts are perhaps equally fine, I give this one an edge; for my taste, they sang a varied selection of numbers: arias, show tunes, popular songs - and did so with flair, showmanship, and sheer joy. Even though some have noted that Jose Carreras was in decline, the truth is that you would not know it from this concert.  As Conductor, Zubin Mehta inspired the Los Angeles Symphony to play as well as any orchestra in the world could have played for this world-wide telecast.  Of interest to me was how the producer decided on the scenery and set designs for this event - that came out in the added DVD features which detail the planning for this concert.  In brief, as a fan of these tenors, I possess every one of their recorded concerts, but if you can only own one, make it this one.",1296259200,2,1355,4.559670781893004
605276,5,6303203256,"I have seen/heard ""The Three Tenors"" (Carreras * Domingo * Pavarotti) in other venues such as Rome and they were just as good as in this presentation. Yet that does not distract from this excellent production from Dodger Stadium in 1994.

We start out with Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chorus singing ""Star Spangled Banner."" As the camera scans the audience, it looks more like a Republican convention.  We are also moved.

As each Tenors come out in order of relevance you get the feeling that their opening salvo is their best. That feeling soon gives way as you find they only get better with each appearance. Moreover, is so carried away that it looks like he would forget his job as a conductor.

Most of the classical presentations on this DVD show titles or subtitles of the individual piece you are about to hear. However, there are a lot of contemporary songs and musicals that evidently they assume we know and do not show the subtitles to what we hear. In some cases, this can be fun as we wait until the popular part of the song and say ""Oh now I remember that one.""

I will not go through the whole repertoire. Everyone has his or her favorites and I am sure to miss that in this review.  Some of the highlights include:
""With a Song in my Heart"" (Rogers)
""I did it my Way"" (look to the audience)
""Moon River""
""Granada""
""Nessun Dorma"" Turandot / Act 3 (more than once)
""Those Were the Days""
""America""
""Singing in the Rain"" (check out the audience again)
""Brazil""

When they got around to singing ""Dein Ist Mein Ganzes Herz"" I had the distinct feeling that they were better pronouncing German than they were English. This may be because they are more familiar with the songs and practice them. In any event even though you can compare the tenors none of them were lacking at any point in this presentation.

605345,5,6303203256,"Though a bit belated--14 years--the music contained in this concert lives forever. For over 50 years I was involved in the very high end audio business, therefore I believe my review is presented with some merit. The Los Angeles Philharmonic could not have been any better , as is the chorus. The Tenors had the ""bubbling over"" audience at their mercy; even after the final encore, the applause, shouting, etc. would not stop. As usual, Pavarotti was the showman and his Nessun Dorma brought down the house. However, were I to choose a tenor for an opera, my choice, by a close margin, would have to be Carretras, though any of the three would do more than a little justice to any opera. The recording quality was/is supberb---tell the wife to leave the house and crank up the volume to really enjoy. Events such as this concert come along only once in a lifetime.

More music, and you get to see the 3 awesome singers. I felt ""gipped"", because the finale (""Nessun Dorma"" by all 3) wasn't on the CD, but that's no big deal. Anyway, the only complaint is with the programming of the DVD. On the package, it lists the chapters, but on the disk, the chapters are different. The package lists the final ""world"" medley as seperate chapters, but the medley is one. Also, there are no special features. But, altogether, I love the DVD.",1180828800,7,615,4.451327433628318

The reviews I've read here are no exaggeration - this is a must see for everyone. I'm deeply moved by what beautiful things humans can create together when the conditions are right. I wish these guys wouldn't have to get old; the world needs more of the Three Tenors! (and, of course, Mehta and the beautiful orchestra and chorus)",1165622400,5,489,4.384615384615385

605450,5,6303203256,"Not only did they have Mehta, but the LA Phil and LA Opera chorus which makes this outshine the first performance in 1990.  Of course, both performances are certainly worth collecting and you may get someone into an opera house with these top tenors.  I was in the audience that night and must say they all sounded in top voice to me live and recorded.  After repeated viewings I never tire of the arias.  They changed the program right up to performance time and the printed programs didn't match what was sung that night.  Who cares!  This is just plain fun for everyone involved as well as the viewer!  My only complaint is that the subtitles are ""English"" but just the librettos are subtitled, not the English translation so I hestiate to show it to a newbie.  No translation is provided with the DVD but the Laser version did as did the VHS.  Would be nice if the manufacturers would look at a DVD before releasing it with such glaring errors.  This is a must have whether you are an opera fan or not!  Bocelli could take a few lessons from watching this disc!  Hopefully, people who think he is an opera singer will compare and see that there is a difference even with voices amplified.  This is A MUST BUY!  Watch it when you are depressed and it will surely change your mood for the better!  Such singing!  Such Fun!",1084492800,18,1324,4.431535269709544
605452,5,6303203256,"Most people, opera lovers and opera discoverers alike, enjoy this concert immensely. However, it has also suffered some criticism, which I can't help but feel is somewhat unjustified and does not represent an accurate portrayal of this mesmerising performance. It is clear, from the selection of songs, that this concert is designed for popular consumption rather than a highbrow, purist audience. It is thought by some that Jose Carreras is perhaps not as powerful or captivating as Domingo or Pavarotti in performance, but his choice of songs and arias here show him 'sticking to what he is good at'. `With A Song In My Heart', for instance, is similar to songs he sung in his role in West Side Story - a lighter, more musical theatre choice. His final solo aria however, 'E Lucevan Le Stelle', is bold, technically demanding, and he sings it with skill and feeling. As for the other two tenors, their selections perfectly show off their range and skills as performers as well as singers. The first three solos are reflective and beautifully conducted by Mehta, but new fans to opera should not be put off by the fact that they may not have heard of these, because the second set of solos seem designed to capture and entertain the audience. Domingo's 'Granada' is fabulous - he really pours everything into it, he glows with passion and vigour. Pavarotti singing Ave Maria is an emotional highlight, demonstrating his talent for singing more gentle arias, as well as his more famous power and range in 'Nessun Dorma'. The final solo's are the three at their very best and most impressive. Domingo portrays a definite character and personality in 'Vesti la Giubba', breaking down the language barrier for viewers who are unfamiliar with the opera it is taken from. Pavarotti does not disappoint, concluding the solos with his famous rendition of Nessun Dorma, which can't fail to blow you away. The medleys and songs they sing together provide an extra level of enjoyment in that the three distinctly different personalities come across so effectively. They are playful and hugely entertaining, without an ego in sight.
And so, if the idea of sitting through 2 hours or so of opera is your idea of hell, or you have every three tenors album ever released, this will not disappoint you. For fans, this is a fabulous selection of old classics and more obscure arias, which showcase beautifully whoever your favourite might be. For those who are curious or have watched everything else in the video cupboard, you won't be able to help sensing the atmosphere in the venue. A few famous faces are there to be spotted in the crowd, and you might be surprised at how many songs you actually know and like, from classic musicals and around the world (e.g. All I ask of You, Brazil, America, Those Were the Days, Singing in the Rain).

For someone not farmiliar to opera, this is the one too get.  it has all the brodway punch mixed with old-style opera in a fun manner which will entertain you to the core.  This is one of the last times to hear the three while they were still singing standard opera reperitoire in their increasing Age.
  Domingo is in fabulous voice again.  To me, he is the clear best in this concert. He gets all the best reperitore and he is in good vocal condition.  It is a dark silky voice, darker even then the '90 concert. At 54 he is still able to deliver a knokout version of Vesti la Giubba, which is acted and sung in a most thrilling and convincing manner.  His Granada is the best it gets.  He sings this song like no other, you will be thrilled as the audience goes crazy  throuought the song.  Once in a while you will be mystyfied at how he is able too sing so gloriously with his tounge lodged in the back of his throat, but that only adds to his mystique.
  Carreras is no longer the tenor he once was, but he makes up for it in passion.  His first two songs are both duds as he yells through the prayer from Le Cid and mispronounces his way through ""With a Song in My heart.""  After the first medley, however, he seems ready for buisiness as he gives a knockout tu ca nun chiangne, (despite it being sung at fortissimo).  E Lucevan Le Stelle is interesting, but not impressive.  He gives a tear-jerking interpretation but his pianissimo at ""Discolea dai veli"" sounds like a head voice or falsetto whereas if you heard this Aria 10 years ago he would blast away at it.  For carreras this concert is of interest as one of the last times he ever sings italian Opera before lightening his reperitoire.  I would refer people stunned by this diminished, wobbly carreras to his new Golden years Cd which perserves his career in much better voice.
  Pavorotti is in excellent voice.  His reperitoire selection is a bit boring though.  his Porqouoi Me Revellier is the highlight.  Why he sang Ave Maria I will never understand, but whatever.  His performance in the medleys in extremely lively and funny showing his full talents.  Domingo picks more exciting reperitoire.
  The medley is, i think, the highlight in the history of the three tenors.  Every song is fresh and exilarating.  Domingo in ""Those were the Days"" was the highlight along with Carreras's characature's in Marchiare.
  The encores were amazing, with domingo once again a highlight with his hyjinx.
  overall this is the concert for newcomers to the three tenors and opera, as it is a glitzy rout through opera and broadway.",1048032000,31,2670,4.5399159663865545
