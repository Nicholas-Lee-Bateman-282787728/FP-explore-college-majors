4651466,5,B005C5PV2K,"Patricio Guzman, Chile's poet-documentarian, remains haunted and riveted by what happened in his country during the revolutionary years of Salvador Allende's administration and the US-backed fascist coup which ended it. The coup d'etat was depicted in the great political film,The Battle of Chile.and the long period of amnesiac forgetting takes us up to Nostalgia for the Light,his present filmic essay taking in archaeology,astronomy and recovery of the disappeared. Art must confront its Guernicas and 9/11s. We get the scene of dust particles swirling in a sunbeam, a Lucretion settling of the thoughts about our being and origins. He takes us back to the Chile of his youth,where he ""loved science fiction stories, lunar eclipses and watching the sun through a piece of smoky glass"".We get tableaux of nostalgia,""Only the present moment existed"".A dissolve follows setting out the cosmological and historical parameters,in the specific setting of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, visible from space,the driest place on Earth. This humanist document unites idealist skysearchers and realist earthsearchers.

The translucent sky allows astronomers to see the boundaries of the universe,light from the past takes millions of years to reach us. The desert is also home to pre-Columbian shepherd's bones and rock carvings, and the place where Pinochet buried bodies in mass graves,following imprisonment,torture and murder. The desert is a palimpsest of the past,ossuary and observatory. Elderly women search among its stones for murdered loved ones. Balancing philosophical reflections on human memory and the matter of the stars,the calcium of our bones comes from the stars."" The present doesn't exist"",according to Gaspar Galaz,a young astronomer,'Now' is a mental construct. We get an extraordinaryshot of a constellation. Guzman uses poetic intuition to connect his subjects,associations of thought. Although at times you feel he's edging one subject in via another,he claims to be obsessed by the 100 years life of the Chilean republic,the miners in the Atacama(19C),the disappearance of the indigenous Indians. Lautaro Nunes archaeologist, reveals the depth of the amnesia. The images are beautiful. The telescopes with their fabulous visibility contrast to the invisibility of the lost ones,beneath ones feet.

Guzman gathers testimonies from Luis Henriquez,survivor of the Chacabuco concentration camp(mines adapted by the military+barb wire)relates how the inmates felt totally free due to astonomy lessons they took. Another veteran Miguel memorises the exact dimensions of each camp and makes architectural scale drawings of them when in exile,so their existence could not be denied. The heart of the film shows women from the town of Calama,Vicky Saavedra, finding her brother's teeth,skull bit and footbone in a sock,or Violetta Berrios,tenaciously searching for her husband,or the unearthing of shards of bone and mummified body parts by the diminishing band of bereaved relatives of the `disappeared'.Only memory Guzman says allows us to live in the `fragile present moment'.Valentina Rodriguez, unites the two halves of the film,a mother of two in her 30s who works at the astronomical organisation. Brought up by her grandparents when her parents were `disappeared',they taught her to observe the stars. Astronomy has helped give another dimension to her pain."" We are all part of a current of energy,of recyclable matter...nothing comes to an end.""Nostalgia is counter-atomist,bringing together the worlds of science and human affairs and Guzman reactivates the `gravitational force of memory'against the atrocities. Truly moving transcendence of materialism.",1347494400,10,3684,5.73308957952468
4651467,3,B005C5PV2K,Some very interesting information and some beautiful images but the filmmakers really stretched and contorted to create a thematic connection between astronomy and astronomers and the women searching for the remains of their loves ones in the deserts.,1323820800,5,251,5.631578947368421
4651468,4,B005C5PV2K,"William Lee, DVD Verdict --Nostalgia for the Light is a poetic documentary blending science, history, and personal reflection. The focus is on the Atacama Desert, a South American plateau west of the Andes Mountains and the driest place on the planet. Here, where the sky is so translucent, astronomers examine the most distant and oldest galaxies. When a Chilean scientist talks about how their research may reveal the secrets of the galaxy's past, director Patricio Guzman (The Battle for Chile) remarks that the Chilean populace hasn't yet come to terms with their recent past--specifically, the September, 1973 military coup. ""This is the paradox which concerns you most,"" the scientist answers, ""it's worthy of your concern.""

The arid conditions of the desert have preserved human remains from the Pre-Columbian era leaving a treasure trove for archaeologists. Guzman observes that both astronomers and archaeologists examine the past to understand our present condition. Yet, that same effort is not directed toward his country's recent history. After the end of Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship, the Chilean government's attitude has been to ""turn the page"" on history leaving unaccounted untold numbers of injustices from the era. The Atacama Desert was also used as mass graves for dissidents made to disappear by the military. At the heart of Guzman's film is a sense of suppressed rage that casts a cold shadow over everything. Still, the optimism and wonder of scientific discovery, complemented by mesmerizing photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, provide points of inspiration.

The DVD's technical presentation serves the material well. The picture is clean and detail is sharply rendered. Stationary images ranging from close ups of the desert floor to wide landscape shots are breathtaking in their beauty and stillness. Whenever the camera moves, the image can't help blurring. There were times that gave me want for a higher resolution look at the scenery but this SD presentation is quite good nonetheless. Interviews are filmed simply and exhibit the crispness of originating on video. Audio is an adequate stereo mix (despite the listing of 5.1 on the packaging) that delivers the narration and interviews clearly. The film is very quiet so there's not a great deal to show off in the sound department.

For extras, the disc includes five short films by Guzman and their combined running time equals another feature documentary. The individual films are: Chile, A Galaxy of Problems (32 minutes), Oscar Saa, Technician of the Stars (10 minutes), Jose Maza, Sky Traveler (13 minutes), Maria Teresa and the Brown Dwarf (12 minutes) and Astronomers from my Neighborhood (14 minutes) . Each film interviews a person on the subject of astronomy or Chile's history.

4651469,5,B005C5PV2K,"Very few films have affected me the way that ""Nostaligia for the Light"" has.  I am haunted by its images of the barren Atacama desert, of the otherworldly moonscape on which both enormous telescopes and concentration camps have been built, of the crude rock carvings of the prehistoric inhabitants of the region.  The way that the film ties these -- and many other -- images together is nothing short of triumphant.

Add to this the thematic explorations of the film -- time, grief, mystery, memory, human (and humane) frailty, the transience of all things, the genocide of political protestors during Pinochet's brutal tenure, and the search for meaning in an otherwise indifferent setting -- and you have a film that moved me beyond words.  I have reviewed only a few products or books for Amazon, and generally don't place much stock in overly enthusiastic ramblings such as this one.  Somehow, though, I felt compelled to comment on this film, which shed a great deal of light on a great many subjects without once becoming heavy-handed or digressive.

As the film points out, we are such stuff as the universe is made of.  Stars contain the same elements as the bones of those buried in mass graves in the Atacama.  The same light that ennobles the best of our intentions (an understanding of who we are as human beings) also reveals cruelty, torture, and murder on a scale that is almost impossible to understand.

And yet, all is tied together through this terrific work of filmmaking.  Seeing it was, truly, a life changing experience.  The final scenes are so powerful, both in terms of the human spirit and its capacity for great good in the face of true evil, that words simply can not describe the majesty they convey.  See this film: you'll be a better person for having done so.",1316649600,32,1792,4.745161290322581
4651470,5,B005C5PV2K,"a fantastic film that i highly recommend. unexpectedly, perhaps, it pulls together several strands, all fascinating in themselves, into one beautiful and humbling, touching story.",1316563200,9,179,6.2
4651471,2,B005C5PV2K,Nostalgia has some interesting footage.  The Atacama scenes are haunting. The Pinochet references are too incomplete.  The personal anecdotes while interesting don't complete the tale. The philosophical rants are trite.,1316476800,5,219,6.266666666666667
4651472,5,B005C5PV2K,"This extraordinary documentary essay film examines recent human history through the lens of the outer reaches of space.  Patricio Guzman, celebrated documentarian whose work has always focused upon the hidden past of Chile, takes the opportunity here to consider the nature of time and memory by juxtaposing two seemingly incompatible investigations that are taking place in the Atacama desert of Chile.  This desert, the driest place in the world, is home to some of the largest telescopes in the world, where astronomers take advantage of the arid skies in order to gaze at the cosmos, in hopes of unlocking the mysteries of the universe.  At the same time, this desert is home to other, more unsettling mysteries, since it is believed that the bodies of political prisoners from the Pinochet era were buried here.  As the astronomers research the stars, the families of victims examine the earth.  As the astronomers look to the lights that shine in the midst of the darkness of the heavens, these intrepid women seek to cast light on an era of secrecy and corruption.

In a conversation at the Cannes film festival, where this film was first screened, Guzman described it as ""metaphysical, mystical or spiritual, astronomical, ethnographic and political.""  You might add ""environmental,"" since the film asks us to consider ourselves in relation to our environment both in the broadest sense, as we are inhabitants of a small rock hurtling through the immensity of an inhospitable space, and in the most immediate sense as we are political creatures, who make for ourselves an uneasy home among others like us.  Above all, though - and this is what I take to be the decisive feature that makes us different from all other animals - what surrounds us, our true environs, is not some place, but it is time itself, or history.  Time is our habitat, insofar as our way of life is not something fixed.  We live out of and upon our own past; we do not inhabit nature directly, rather we inhabit nature insofar as it has been transformed by our predecessors.  Yet, the problem is that it is so easy to be oblivious to that history to forget that the world we inherit is not the way it has always been or always will be, but the way that we have made it.  One way to recover a sense for the ephemeral nature of the human species is to reflect on those realities for which changes take place on a much longer time scale, the stars and celestial bodies.  Another, equally important, way to remember how quickly we change is to engage in the painstaking process of history, of attempting to remember what we have been and what we have done, and not allow what some might prefer to forget to drift into oblivion.

This film has us look at images of the skies, and of the instruments through which they are seen, and of the people who care for and use these instruments.  At the same time we look at and listen to women who are searching for the remains of their loved ones.  What struck me as most intriguing about this film is its meditation on time, both in its universal sense as measured by the clock or the movements within the cosmos, and its much more personal and intimate sense of the times we remember and the times we forget.  An astronomer in the film points out the implications of a remarkable fact, that when we observe a star we are not observing the present but the past.  As soon as the light from an event has reached our eyes, that event has passed away.  We might say, in general that we can never actually experience our own time, because as soon as its significance is clear it is no longer the present.  At the same time, we cannot truly move on, we cannot overcome the past until it has become clear, until it has come to light for us.  The title of the film ""Nostalgia for the Light"" points to this paradox.  Nostalgia is the feeling of loss that accompanies what is no longer present, what has been left behind.  It might seem strange to be nostalgic for the light, unless one finds oneself in darkness - but as the film suggests, to be in the presence of light is also to be in the presence of loss, it is to be in the presence of an unremediable past, the confrontation of which can alone provide the clarifying insight necessary to move into the future.",1311206400,39,4274,4.550913838120104

4651478,5,B005C5PV2K,"This a a story that unites astronomy with the recent history of Chile in a most creative way.  The ""missing"" persons of the Pinochet regime and its equally missing history are contrasted at many levels with the work in the observatory that overlooks the Alcana Desert where many victims were buried.  It is as Joseph Campbell said of the moon landing in 1969 ""an outer journey into ourselves.""  The healing beauty of the cosmos is brought into the stark reality of human cruelty.  ""Will we ever get to forgiving Gen. Pinochet?"" is a question we all must ask after watching.  And you should watch this film.",1388188800,4,606,4.679245283018868
4651479,5,B005C5PV2K,"Although starting off at a slow pace, the documentary does an excellent job of interweaving three seemingly unrelated studies of the past: astronomy, archaeology, and the search for missing loved ones in the Atacama Desert. The story of the women still searching for their family members and other political prisoners for over 30 years is particularly moving. Remarkably, astronomy is a unifying pursuit and solace for many of those affected by the dictatorship of Pinochet, whether they were prisoners, scientists, or the families of those killed.",1378598400,4,548,5.383720930232558

4651482,5,B005C5PV2K,"""Nostalgia"" seems to me the wrong word here, a somewhat sentimental term where the film is certainly not sentimental. This documentary connects two groups of searchers in the Atacama Desert in Chile: astronomers studying starlight for clues to the history of the universe, and grieving relatives of murdered and disappeared victims of the Pinochet regime who are searching the huge desert (on foot!) for traces of their loved ones' remains. So both groups are looking for ""light'"" on the past, both recent and unimaginably distant. Valuable as an introduction to a little-known extreme environment, and as an exploration of the ongoing trauma from the Chilean dictatorship's cruelties.",1353888000,6,685,5.411214953271028

One part deals with the astronomers perched high on the mountain tops looking backward to the beginnings of the universe.  The other part deals with the people, mostly women, who look for their disappeared loved ones on the Atacama Desert below.  The tragedy wrought by years of Pinochet's ruthless regime is spelled out by these women who hunt in the desert -- their stories are heart wrenching.  The juxtaposition of these two different cultures -- the astronomers in their lofty aerie who look back in time and the women below who are stuck in the present unable to move forward -- is unfathomable that both occupy the same space but are unaware of the other.",1452038400,,718,4.674603174603175
