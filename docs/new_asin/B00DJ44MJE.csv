5819342,4,B00DJ44MJE,"I've been anxious to get my hands on `Wish You Were Here' for about a year now.  I heard about it last year when it was released in Australia and heavily anticipated a stateside release for an awards run in 2012, but that didn't happen.  Despite going on to win a slew of Australian awards (for everything from writing to acting) the film didn't catch on with American audiences when it was finally released in June of this year.  It never reached a theater near me, and so I patiently waited for the DVD release.  I found myself checking my Netflix `saved queue' every week, waiting for word on a release date and then finally it got bumped to the top of my queue and it landed at my front door the beginning of the week.

I've been on the Joel Edgerton train for a while now.  I'll admit right here and now that he is the reason I was awaiting the film with such anticipation.  He's a staggeringly good actor, not to mention an incredibly handsome man, and he just drips with screen presence.  Watching his star slowly rise has been a dream, and with this film and his phenomenal turn in `The Great Gatsby', he's had a banner year so far.

2014 looks even better.

So, Edgerton is what drew me to `Wish You Were Here', and while he is brilliant in the film, he isn't the only thing that kept me watching.  In fact, this is an exceptional ensemble who works wonderfully within the confines of the film itself.  While the narrative is slightly fractured due to the constant flashbacks and oddly fit construction of the film, the performances drive so much of the intention home and make this an unforgettable ride that asks some very provocative questions without forcing us to come to a definite answer.  The open-ended morality of it all feels very intentional, and that makes for an even more impactful finish.

The film tells the story of two couples who suffer a tragic loss while on vacation in South-East Asia.  Dave and Alice are happily married with two children and one on the way.  Alice's sister Steph is newly interested in a young business man named Jeremy who wants her to travel with him to Asia on business.  She convinces her sister and brother-in-law to tag along for moral support and the four wind up having a bang-up time.  The only problem is, only three of them return home to Australia.

Jeremy is missing.

As the plot unfolds the film weaves in flashbacks from their trip with their current debacle, which can get a tad confusing.  As secrets are told (there are more than one) and relationships are strained, the film asks some seriously poignant questions about guilt, betrayal and forgiveness, and it questions moral obligations with some sharply placed facial features.

Like I said, the actors really sell this film.

Edgerton is on a whole other level here, caging so much emotion and brooding to massive effect, only to unleash such unbridled grief at the film's climax.  Felicity Price, who also co-wrote the film, is devastating as his confused and heartbroken wife, and Teresa Palmer serves as a complicated cypher between the two.  The film's cinematography is astounding, some of the best I've seen all year, and the way that the film works itself over your eardrums (crawling into your body) makes this film stick in ways I didn't expect.",1381363200,,3278,4.629757785467128
5819343,3,B00DJ44MJE,"""Something happened the night of the party, after you went to sleep."" Steph McKinney (Palmer) and her boyfriend Jeremy go on a vacation to Cambodia with her sister and her husband Dave (Edgerton). They are having a good time laying on the beach and relaxing. When they return home only three of them make the trip. Now all three are trying to figure out where Jeremy is and why he didn't come back. Only one person knows the truth. This is another perfect example of a movie where the idea is much more exciting then the actual movie. While the movie isn't that bad it is pretty slow moving up until the last 20 min. Until then the movie jumps around a bit and makes it a little hard to follow for the first half. The acting is very good but nothing really seemed to happen for most of the movie. Again, the last quarter is good but getting to that point is a little bit of a struggle. Overall, a movie that starts off very slow but worth sticking with to see the ending. I give it a B-.",1373500800,5,987,4.2
5819344,4,B00DJ44MJE,"Four Australian friends take a carefree vacation in southeast Asia. They visit some of the remnants of the Killing Fields in Cambodia, shop for souvenirs and generally have a great time. Problem is, only three of them come back and the whereabouts of the fourth one becomes a highly charged mystery as this happy, sunny story takes a sinister turn and never goes back!

We see:
  * Joel Edgerton (""Warrior"") is the concerned family man, with a boatyard to run, two little children, a third on the way, and a wife he adores. But he CAN be talked into a little vacation...
  * Felicity Price (Lots of TV) is the pregnant wife. It's her sister dating the importer who talks her and her husband into joining them on vacation.
  * Teresa Palmer (""Warm Bodies"") is the lovely younger sister who is a bit of a loose cannon.
  * Antony Starr (Lots of TV) is the handsome importer who initiates the trip. His whereabouts is the bone of contention with our trio, the drug enforcement people, and a few others I won't name.

In my opinion, director Kieran Darcy-Smith (who also wrote the screen- play) uses an unnecessary number of flashbacks in this R-rated thriller. I found myself trying to spot how far along the pregnant wife was so I could tell how far back we were ""flashing."" But the children, particularly the little boy, are beautifully directed!

As of June, 2013, Amazon only has this in Region 4 format.",1370649600,3,1405,4.602409638554217
5819345,2,B00DJ44MJE,"I first must explain that I am a Sydney resident and know the locations of this film well. As far as the acting and photography goes the film does quite well. As far as the plot and storyline goes it's all downhill. We are meant to believe that first of all this couple; she an AMES teacher and he, a boat builder can afford to live in a million dollar house overlooking star studded Tamarama beach (yes ... I know ... it is only semi-renovated). One presumes they are in their early to mid thirties and have two children whom they leave behind to go on a backpacking holiday through Cambodia. Whilst at a full, half whatever moon party on the beach (normally the realm of 20 somethings straight from College) they take ecstacy with dramatic consequences. She, by the way is around 4 to 5 months pregnant.
The film could have been (like most Australian films) edited down to about 50 minutes. If you leave out the domestic histrionics, around 40 minutes. The fast forward button can be used judiciously during these scenes without affecting one's understanding of the plot.

SPOILER ALERT; the crosscutting between the premature birth of the female lead's child after a drunken car accident and the violent death of one of the characters is so contrived it is silly beyond words.

Presumably this was given the green light by the culture cops of the NSW Film and TV office and Screen Australia because of its' reference to:
* Domestic Conflict
* Marital Infidelity
* Child Prostitution.
* The female lead teaches English to migrants (presumably not in the WASP enclave of Sydney's Eastern Suburbs).

If the film had been treated as a thriller it could have worked well but as with the vast majority of Australian films it is bogged down in the legacy of (must be a) social commentary from the 80s and 90s that makes them tedious and contrived and of little interest except to a very small audience. Overall the characters are not believable and the storyline unlikely. Given the level of corruption in Cambodia would anyone believe that the local Mafia have anything to fear from Australian authorities.
This film was given very generous reviews by local reviewers (see ""the Movie Show""), an unfortunate but common practice, that keeps the local industry in the doldrums and keeps fresh ideas from emerging. In no way is this a criticism of the director but of the Dream Police that keeps local films mired in medriocity.",1362873600,13,2421,4.732227488151659
5819346,5,B00DJ44MJE,"this is an australian film that was a big hit at the sundance film festival and deservedly so. a husband and wife, her sister and the sister's boyfriend take a trip together to cambodia. they are in their thirties. the couple have two children back home and a third on the way.  the pregnant wife can't hold up for long and goes to bed early.  this is the kickoff for the other three to get into trouble.  one of them goes missing.

for the rest of the film we see the three remaining characters trying to sort out their lives in Sydney. intercut with that action are flashbacks to cambodia so we can discover what happened,

one thing i think this captures extremely well is the supposed safety bubble tourists travel in where they believe because they are tourists in that country, they are somewhat protected.  thus, they walk freely about, drinking, mingling And not really watching what is going on.  this is a really bad idea. and the consequences if it may haunt one formthe remainder of one's life.

first rate screenplay.  i now want to see this writer-director's earlier film, ANIMAL KINGDOM.

5819348,4,B00DJ44MJE,"I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Theres not as much tension and suspense as I'd have thought, given the trailer and movie overview.  And it does get slow and bogged down in many spots.  But I still found it intriguing and wondered what happened to this dude.  as the movie progresses, it goes back and forth between the current time, and flashbacks to when the 4 were in Cambodia.  Some other reviewers seemed to think this back and forth was because the director was unimaginative.  But I saw it as a positive, if they had showed the whole time in cambodia, and then went to present day, i don't think the story would have worked as well.  this way, I think it lent more to the story, moving between their current actions, and what happened in Cambodia; how they interacted there and how that is compelling them to find out what happened.

5819353,3,B00DJ44MJE,"Excellent acting.  Kept you guessing until the end.  I think Antony Starr is one of the top 5 actors in the world.  His skills as an actor were not used to full capacity in this film.  I would have liked to have seen more to his character.  He did a great job, but deserved a more challenging part.  The three lead actors were wonderful.  This is not a movie for the mass population because it deals more with acting than the typical Hollywood movie.

8593692,4,B00DJ44MJE,"I originally bought this movie because I'm a Teresa Palmer fan and I would buy anything with her in it.  I was pleasantly surprised with this Australian production.  Rather than go into the details of the movie again since previewers have already done a fine job at that, I will instead mention that the main characters roles were all too familiar as far as Western tourists behaving so cavalier in a foreign country.  I lived 20 years of my life overseas in various countries and the writers were spot on with portraying tourist's bad behavior while traveling.  I've been to Cambodia among other South East Asian countries and this is one particular country with an especially haunting and violent history; one in which you don't want to act up in public and bring unwanted attention to yourselves.  One reviewer mentioned the Westerner Safety Bubble and was exactly right with their comments.  The actors did a great job and just wish Teresa had the lead role, but supporting actress works for me as well. I don't regret buying this one.  Note to Western Tourists/Travelers (and this comes from a seasoned world traveler):  Just because you travel with loaded pockets compared to some of the poor countries you visit, doesn't mean you won't be involuntarily relieved of that money during your travels. Exercise extreme vigilance and don't invite unwanted attention to yourselves.",1462924800,2,1381,4.973913043478261

8593696,4,B00DJ44MJE,"Married couple Dave and Alice are expecting their third child. Alice's' younger sister, Steff, has just started dating an entrepreneur who is based in Cambodia and invites the couple for a week of hedonistic fun before their world is rocked by the wailing of the new baby. They go for the party scene full throttle; then after one particularly busy night, Steff's boyfriend goes missing. This is Jeremy and his phone is still on but there is no sight of him.

Dave and Alice return to Australia and after more fruitless searches so does Steff. The events leading up to the holiday and indeed the happenings in Cambodia are played out in flashback. The narrative can jump around a fair bit so you need to pay attention (or is it me). This is happening as the present events are also unfurling and begin to have an effect on all those concerned. What will be revealed will have resonance for all.

This is a `slow burner' and whilst the story line, at first glance, seems to lack a bit of originality - it actually will keep you guessing for quiet a while. Joel Edgerton (`Warrior' and `Gatsby') as `Dave' puts in an above solid performance but his long suffering wife, Alice, played by Felicity Price gives a performance that would stretch the best of them. It is also well directed and very well shot. The supporting actors are all very good too. It was also part sponsored by Screen Australia which is a credit to them. All in all a film that is recommended for fans of thrillers but who like a slow reveal.",1405123200,,1508,4.52014652014652
