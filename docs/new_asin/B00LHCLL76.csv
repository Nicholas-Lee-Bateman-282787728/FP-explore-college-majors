6487511,4,B00LHCLL76,"Nice 4-disc collection of 3 cool Mortal Kombat films, with the sort of odd inclusion of the superhero film Spawn thrown in as well. I had the original MK and MK: Annihilation in DVD format, but those older discs would only fill up about 2/3 of my screen when played on my new Blu-ray and shown on my large flat screen TV. These new Blu-ray discs however are clearer, cleaner and fill the screen now. Nice. The colors, sound & picture clarity are all much improved from the DVD format. The content of the discs are the same, I believe, as if you bought each movie separately; meaning all the extras are included on each of these four discs. The director's cut of Spawn, for instance, has a TON of bonus content. This is a great way to get a nice mix of films at a really good price. These are not Academy Award caliber films, but they are action-packed and a lot of fun. 4 STARS.",1419638400,7,878,4.263473053892215
