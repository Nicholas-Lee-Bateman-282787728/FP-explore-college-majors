8553773,1,B00AMHFO9S,The DVD is missing four of the 12 cuts listed on the case. I bought it as a holiday gift at the end of October. It was returned to me after Christmas. I was told about the missing songs and cannot return it.  I guess I should have opened the packaging even though it was sold as brand new.,1452470400,,289,3.8983050847457625
8553774,2,B00AMHFO9S,"I have already contacted the distributor of this DVD - and will revise and correct my review when I hear back from them. But I wanted to alert those who may be purchasing it that the contents are not as described.

The Package lists 12 performances and Amazon lists the running time as 40 minutes. What is actually on the DVD are two performances each by The Byrds, The Yardbirds, Them, and Joan Baez. And the running time is 23 minutes.  The package lists two more each by The Kinks and Creedence Clearwater Revival. The DVD Menu also lists just the first 8 songs.
Most of these are from European TV and the two by Them (from French TV which identifies the band on screen as ""Les Them"") are pretty good and decent quality. The Yardbirds videos are fuzzy. And the two Joan Baez ones are nice but the synchronization seems off.

So, unless I post an update, understand that the DVD you order may only have the eight performances.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
