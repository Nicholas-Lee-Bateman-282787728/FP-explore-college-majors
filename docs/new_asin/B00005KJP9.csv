7943502,3,B00005KJP9,This DVD is composed of two smaller documentaries. The sound quality is not very good and the narrator a bit boring but the content of the narration is not too bad and the film clips used are pretty good. So while overall it is not a great documentary it is not bad either and gets the job done.,1158278400,5,295,4.103448275862069

The only upside was that they included some rare photographs and footage, much of which I hadn't seen.",1141084800,2,341,4.65
