8546583,2,B00A3YMU60,"Lightnin' Bill Carson, 1936 film

The movie begins with men walking on a street. The town of Blue Gap prohibits carrying guns. A stranger wins at poker (watch him switch decks). Bill Carson tells the other players they had no chance. Hand-made horseshoes have identifying marks. Carson visits the ""Miner's Roost"" at high noon. The customers quickly leave. Carson talks to the pair, then warns them to leave the state. He too will leave soon. That gambler finds a discarded letter. In the town of San Jacinto they await Bill Carson. A typewriter was a new high-tech machine in 1874. We see the Palace Hotel and the poker table. The `Pecos Kid' tells of an undelivered letter. Men scheme to rob the stage coach. Next we see the isolated cabin where they meet after the robbery. The sheriff's man Sam Bates followed. There is a fight, and a shot. Bill Carson comes by and finds the body and the ace of spades.

Bill Carson comes to San Jacinto anyway. He talks to the sheriff, and tells him about Sam Bates. ""What happened?"" Carson wants a list of the trustful men in town. ""He's my brother."" Will the `Pecos Kid' talk? Those two robbers free the `Pecos Kid' so he can escape. Carson knows Stack is lying. The posse catches the `Pecos Kid' and finds him guilty. Carson confronts Stack and Breed, they accuse each other. But its too late for the `Pecos Kid'. ""I'll remember every one of you as long as I live."" Tom seeks revenge. `El Vengador' puts notches on his pistol. The Deputies won't go after Tom Rand. ""Travel with God, friend."" There is a final interview between Tom Rand and Carson. ""There's a first time for everything."" And so it ends.

This film seems to have some lost scenes. It is a conventional story about robberies controlled by an unsuspected prominent person in town, with the added complication of a gambler with bad luck and a brother who seeks revenge. Overall, the story seems too complicated. It does serve as a warning about drinking too much, gambling, and hanging out with the wrong crowd.",1467244800,,2014,4.620111731843576
