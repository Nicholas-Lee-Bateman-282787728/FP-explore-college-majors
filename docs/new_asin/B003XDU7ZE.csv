5242989,5,B003XDU7ZE,"Love this show.  Didn't start watching until the middle of 4th season so needed to catch up and boy do you ever.  So much mischief and mayhem!!  Kind of a dirty type soap opera with great characters.  If you just started watching you really need to catch up with the beginning so you understand more of what is going on.  If you like blood, guts, bad boys and girls this is your kind of show.  Sit back...but don't expect to relax too much action.

5243001,5,B003XDU7ZE,"We've seen every episode on tv of course, but now I've Ordered this as a Christmas present from my husband (and maybe it was a little for myself as well hehe), this was the first thing EVER that I have bought from Amazon.com, and it just made me want to order more and more, and frankly I may be a new Amazon.com shopper addict! I could not find a cheaper price for both seasons anywhere else. My husband and I belong to a MC (Motorcycle Club) (although ours is not a 1% criminal activity club as this series protrays) This is the BEST MC portrayal Televisions series I've seen!, This series is sooo spot on accurate to what MC brotherhoods and their love, loyalty and dedication to one another are all about. If you have not watched this series it is a MUST...the actors are very realistic, except for when one of the lead characters british accent slips out every now and than, and my husband and I like to try to spot it when it happens lol. The story line is fancinating, and each episode will definitely make you hurry to get to the next. I have ordered the other two seasons now as well from Amazon. If you enjoy the MC, and in my opinion a Hamelot like storyline, The Sons Of Anarchy will NOT disappoint you.",1322956800,,1215,4.310043668122271

5243003,5,B003XDU7ZE,"I really like this series, because it isn't your regular Glee meets Housewives does Jersey Shore and creates CSI kind of thing. It is gritty, harsh and realistic. Even though it depicts the fictitious motorcycle gang Samcro, it is a eye opening study of gangs like the Hells Angels. How crime is a part of their double lives, as they cope with the walking the plank lifestyle they have chosen. The live it because they believe in the code. It is interesting to see how the discrimination of both gender and race is embedded into their infrastructure, even if not all members believe each rule is valid. Truly a commendable watch and worth an Emmy or ten.",1320278400,,654,4.598290598290598

I love motorcycles and went to many bike rallies, and had not known of this series till about a month ago. I got hooked. Didn't want to watch new season till I caught up on what has happened so far.

5243006,5,B003XDU7ZE,"This is one of the most unique shows on televison today. Suprised it hasn't been copied by the other networks! Its very easy to get caught up in all the action due to the excellent acting by everyone involved. I won't bore you will all the details except to tell you its about a motorcycle club (gang) in a mythical northern California town called Charming. The president of the club seems bent on trying to destroy the club with his reckless business dealings with other unsavory characters while his son, actually stepson,tries to bring back the integrity the club once had. To truly enjoy this series you need to watch it from season 1 and follow up to the current time. If you do I guarantee you will be hooked as I am.",1316736000,,723,4.443609022556391

5243021,5,B003XDU7ZE,"My wife and I have been regular viewers of the TV series ""Sons of Anarchy"" since it first began appearing on our cable TV broadcasts.  While this sort of program may not please everybody's tastes, ""Sons of Anarchy"" provides us with an insight into the workings and personalities of a
California motorcycle gang.  That the gang is engaged in the criminal enterprise of gun running, does not dampen one's empathy for the characters.  When we purchased the first and second seasons of this series, we were surprised that there was much more story telling on the DVDs than we had seen on the TV broadcasts.  By repeatedly viewing the two seasons we were able to pick out a number of plots and subplots that we hadn't fully understood from the TV broadcasts.  We have ordered Season Three of the series, and we are hoping that Amazon will soon be able to fill our order, as we are looking very forward to re-running the season.",1296172800,,922,4.597560975609756

5243031,5,B003XDU7ZE,"I tried watching this myself and just the opening, of a biker gang holding its turf and making its mostly illegal income, did nothing for me.  The blonde lead (see cover), who plays Jacks, is very good looking and might be enough for many women to enjoy the show.  However, the premise so disinterested me that I stopped watching it.

So why am I giving it 5 stars?  Because if you are right now looking for an xmas gift for the male in your life, you have just happened on the mother lode.  I got this for my husband and he was absolutely glued to it.  Right now he's agitating for season three, which just concluded on tv.  There are only a few shows which have managed to do this for him.  Ladies, if you are stymied as to what to get HIM, this is IT.",1291161600,,754,4.116438356164384

5243034,5,B003XDU7ZE,"Why are you guys complaining. They had it at the sale price for a WEEK. It's not Amazon's fault you saw it the last day of the sale and decided not to buy. You had the opportunity. Should of jumped on it when you had the chance.

By the Way the series is awesome and I got it at a remarkable deal. $38.00",1291075200,,304,3.8253968253968256
