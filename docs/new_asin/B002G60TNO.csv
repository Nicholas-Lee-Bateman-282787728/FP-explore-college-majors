8369684,5,B002G60TNO,"Maki Horikita did an amazing job in this drama, she seems to get better and better throughout her acting. This drama is really funny, at parts I could not stop laughing. But it also focuses mainly on family and the important of that familial connection which is pretty touching.",1252800000,4,278,4.6938775510204085
8369685,4,B002G60TNO,"This show is really funny! It takes two to three episodes to sprout it's wings, but it is worth it. SPOILER ALERT. The moment when a gun is pointed at Maki Horikita's character Chisato , you know they are attempting something different. Maki Horikita's ongoing personality in her previous TV shows/movies; she is always the pretty, but feisty Japanese girl.
  In Atashinchi No Danshi, they take it to a whole new level. The story has Chisato facing many harsh decisions in a dysfunctional setting. Kind of like a insane asylum. However,she perseveres, sacrifices and ultimately succeeds. Highly recommended viewing!!",1247788800,4,616,5.212121212121212
