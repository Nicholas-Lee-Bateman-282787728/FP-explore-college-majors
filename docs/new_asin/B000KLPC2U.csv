They did just that for me, and I quite enjoyed these videos. I must say they were done quite professionally and were very tasteful in keeping of the clients modesty. I recommend these to any mt expanding their skillset or honing skills from school, A new etsy starting out that may have such duties in a spa setting.",1452816000,,470,4.402298850574713
8158027,5,B000KLPC2U,I enjoyed these videos. I ordered 3 different titles of instructional videos in the series. I felt they were well executed & the instructor was clear & concise. I ordered them because I will be offering body wraps at work & I was looking at some alternatives to what I already know how to do.  The only thing I have to offer above what she put on her videos is buy a table warmer & I was taught to cover the client more for warmth. 1-2 larger towels in the laundry never hurt anyone. For the sake of the video I could see perhaps why drape the way they did. But that was the difference in my schooling. The actual techniques were very well shown. I recommend these videos to anyone who wants to learn more.,1445385600,,706,4.1911764705882355
8158028,5,B000KLPC2U,"Finding out how to do body scrubs properly & getting lots of practice has been huge for me. They are a  very popular procedure at the spa that I work at, and I wanted some additional training to get a feel for what methods would provide the most effective and comfortable treatments for my clients.

This video provides a very thorough account of everything to do in preparation, during, and after different body scrub and exfoliating treatments.

This is an excellent refresher to supplement your education, but is also full of information that I had not learned or considered.

The instructor in this video series is a wonderful teacher! Even experienced estheticians can surely learn something from her!",1424649600,,706,4.9576271186440675
