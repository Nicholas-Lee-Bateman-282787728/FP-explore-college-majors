5340106,2,B009INALQS,"They spend a lot of time doing nothing and arguing. Show me sites,show me folklore, show me ancient ptroglyphs with Bigfoot on them, which I was really annoyed that they did for a split second, and didn't actually show anything! Since, we are not going to see Bigfoot, go into the Native American lore and interview Native Americans who have heard stories passed down.  It could be very interesting, disappointed that it is not.",1360886400,4,428,4.783783783783784
5340107,4,B009INALQS,"I have purchased the Finding Bigfoot DVD and applied its learned treaties to my search for an albino unicorn in the marsh areas of upper Minnesota.  Though I have not yet found a unicorn I have located multiple food sources that clearly support a breeding population of albino unicorns.  Using established and scientific methods to lure the unicorn into a particular area, I employed a number of unicorn calls, a baby crying, a small goat  and a disco ball - all methodology approved by the Finding Bigfoot  program.  The results have been almost more than I could hope for.  i have located numerous  tracks of a hoofed creature consistent with those of  a unicorn.  I have also been able to acquire graining images of an animal moving on all four legs through a densely wooded area - also consistent with unicorn reports.  In the end, I believe there is clear evidence that unicorns, and more specifically albino unicorns, exist.  Thank you Finding Bigfoot crew.",1360713600,2,963,4.810975609756097

I know she is supposed to be some kind of scientist,but she comes off with the most stupid crap ever,she near calls folks liers to they face. Then reaches so far up her butt to come up with something else,she makes comments more idiotic than those she debunks.

I haven't yet bought this dvd because I'm not sure if it's a selection of certain shows or a full season, but I would love to know if Animal Planet will be releasing full seasons of this show on DVD any time soon. But it's a very entertaining show and I had the privilege of being part of the filming of the Buckeye Bigfoot episode in October of 2011 and again in a recap in January of 2012. The cast and crew were all super nice and were more than willing to have their pictures taken with fans, answer questions and talk to witnesses and listen to stories. A great experience!",1359072000,5,749,4.172413793103448
5340111,5,B009INALQS,"I own all of the Finding Bigfoot seasons 1, 2 and 3,through the beauty of Amazon Instant Videos! I love watching these episodes. I also watch live every Sunday night when it comes on Animal Planet TV. Yes, I make popcorn and proceed to sit through Matt, Bobo, Ranae and Cliff as they eagerly anticipate finding some evidence of this elusive creature. It is very informative too! I especially appreciate the hard lab evidence that they encounter as in the recent episode where the team took some hair fibers that were given to them, to a lab for DNA processing. It is fun to watch and entertaining to say the least. Bobo makes the best squatch call because it is the deepest and strongest sounding. IMHO... Keep up the good work!",1358121600,15,728,4.564885496183206
5340112,4,B009INALQS,"The show is interesting and as someone who has looked into the Bigfoot phenomena for years, much of what is reported by eyewitnesses on the show collaborates with what I have heard before. The night investigations seem questionable to me and some of the theories they have about sasquatches are spoken of as though they are a fact which seems ridiculous to me. But, the show is not a complete farce as many say it is. And anyone who has seriously looked into to the science behind it knows this.",1357084800,3,495,4.511111111111111
5340113,4,B009INALQS,"[This is not a review of this particular product (which neither me nor anybody else has seen - yet), but a general comment on the two first seasons of ""Finding Bigfoot"".]

""Finding Bigfoot"" is a typical American TV show, somewhere in the twilight zone between documentary, reality TV and scripted entertainment. Somewhat surprisingly, given the ""unscientific"" subject matter, it's aired on Animal Planet. But then, we *are* tired of lions, wildebeests and Yellowstone wolves, aren't we?

""Finding Bigfoot"" follows a research team of four people whose mission is to find Bigfoot (a.k.a. Sasquatch), an elusive ape or ape-man supposedly roaming the wilder parts of the United States. Mainstream science regards Bigfoot as a silly tall-tale or hoax, while Native Americans consider it to be a supernatural spirit-being. The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), to which the research team belongs, firmly believes that the Sasquatch is a real, flesh-and-blood creature unknown to science. Thus, the BFRO are ""cryptozoologists"".

The team in ""Finding Bigfoot"" is led by BFRO's founder Matt Moneymaker. He is assisted by two true believers, Cliff Barackman and the inimitable Bobo. The fourth member is a house sceptic, Ranae Holland. All episodes are built around the same concept: the BFRO travels to some God-forsaken part of the United States or Canada, investigates possible Bigfoot footage, interviews local eye-witnesses and finally attempts to find a Sasquatch themselves, using various decidedly unorthodox research methods which would give a real zoologist the creeps. Each episode also contain Matt Moneymaker's wild speculations about Bigfoot's habits, Bobo's one-liners about ""this forest being soooo squatchy"" and Ranae's (failed) attempts to keep the other team-members down to earth.

I admit that ""Finding Bigfoot"" is entertaining - if you have the right sense of humour. I mean, Bobo is quite the character! The most interesting part of each episode is the stories of the local eye-witnesses. In fact, it's a pity ""Finding Bigfoot"" doesn't feature more of these. Matt's and Bobo's speculations about Bigfoot's behaviour are also interesting, but perhaps for other reasons (see further below).

The biggest problem with shows like this is, of course, that ""the show must go on"". Even when the evidence for Bigfoot is hopelessly thin, the team members simply *must* roam the local forests and pretend to see or hear something. Since the nocturnal expeditions tend to get somewhat dull after a couple of episodes, the team also have to come up with stranger and stranger ideas about how to lure the elusive creature closer. How about a live monkey in a cage, or a radio-controlled toy deer? Since Animal Planet has no plans to discontinue the show, I suppose this works - for the ratings.

Personally, I think BFRO are out on a wild goose chase. I suppose it's *possible* that an unknown primate is lurking around somewhere in the Rockies (few things are absolutely impossible on this strange planet), but many eye-witness reports are biologically impossible or absurd. One honest eye-witness claims to have seen an adult Bigfoot in a tree. The house sceptic Ranae points out that the tree branches aren't large enough to hold a creature the size of a gorilla. Another witness has seen a 10 - 11 feet tall Bigfoot in broad daylight in a small patch of forest surrounded by open country - so how come nobody else saw it? Very often, the Sasquatches are drawn to human habitat, as if they wanted contact. They peek into windows, lurk around campfires, show up close to playgrounds or in the middle of Suburbia (sic). This is inconsistent with an elusive creature whose main chance of survival is to avoid human contact as much as possible. It's also curious that no ""squatch"" has ever been caught or killed if they so consistently leave the pristine wilderness. Note also that Bigfoot reports are coming in from all 50 states of the Union. These creatures are just as home on mountain tops in the Pacific Northwest as in the tropical swamps of Florida, and are even reported from Rhode Island (which is ""squatchy as hell"" according to Bobo).

The elusive character of Bigfoot presumably also explains the BFRO's rather strange speculations about their habits. Moneymaker claims that Bigfoot can mimic the sounds of coyotes and wolves, thus in effect fooling anyone who wants to locate the creature. Bobo at one point says that Bigfoot can eat goose and ducks by diving underwater and pull them down by their legs! Is Bigfoot amphibious? This must be a stranger ape than the aberrant species known as ""Homo sapiens""...

That being said, I'm nevertheless fascinated by Bigfoot sightings. (I'm also childishly fascinated by the antics of the BFRO researchers!) There is some suggestive physical evidence that something strange is really going on beyond the city limits, including the famous Patterson-Gimlin film. But above all, there seems to be a paranormal aspect to much of the Bigfoot phenomenon. Matt Moneymaker makes an interesting comment in the North Carolina episode. He claims that sasquatches are often seen around power lines, and speculates that they somehow use powerlines as their ""highways"" when moving up and down the country. Maybe. Or maybe there is a connection between paranormal phenomena and electricity... ;-)

I'm not sure how to rate ""Finding Bigfoot"", but since these guys actually made me watch most episodes on Youtube, I suppose I have to give it four stars. Thanks for the Bigfootainment! However, I feel more ""fringey"" than the indefatigable explorers of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization...",1352505600,9,5647,5.162841530054645

5340190,1,B009INALQS,"I have watched four or five of these episodes but only when there is absolutely nothing better on TV than watching outcasts in Alaska ""braving"" Alaska's cold. I would almost rather watch another boring and underwhelming show about tuna fishermen. Each week the scenario is similar. Show some maps, visit the local townspeople, and split up into teams and then turn on their cool night vision goggles and go into the woods. Love the way they whisper to one another and then all of a sudden Bobo lets out his ""Squatch"" call.
I suppose these types of shows do offer employment for the actors and the crew which is a good thing.
I know, I know, no one forces me to watch this crock of bull and I can always switch channels, which I usually do. When they find and hogtie a Bigfoot, then I will watch this show.",1432339200,,805,4.409395973154362

5340192,5,B009INALQS,"First of all, if you're doing investigations while trying to prove a bigfoot is real, and your name is Moneymaker...I'd change my name. Just saying.

This is a great show and just what I needed for a bigfoot marathon. It's great to see someone investigating these claims with more experience than the fools on Monsterquest. On Monsterquest, someone will put up a trail cam and catch 50 photos of deer and then leave, or think they found DNA and spend the entire show telling you of the testing involved, only to find it's nothing. Just say that to begin with and don't waste my time.

But with Finding Bigfoot, everyone is great using bigfoot calls and thermal cameras, investigating witnesses, even trying to see if the sighting could be recreated, trying to determine if the witness was mistaken or bogus. Great recreations, great investigating as well. It's even great having a skeptic (Ranae) involved to try to find another explanation, though yes she is way too scientific at times. I think if a bigfoot walked into their view, she would be mauled while trying to inspect the creature's body for a zipper. But Bobo and Cliff are my fave investigators, both with dead-on awesome bigfoot calls. Matt reminds me of over-eager Ray Stantz from Ghostbusters who, after finding their first ghost, yells ""GET HER!!!"".

My frustration is when they spend the entire show interviewing witnesses and trying to recreate the sighting, then they go out and do their bigfoot calls trying to attract a bigfoot....and either they hear a genuine bigfoot call, tree knocks, find tracks, or catch something on thermal...then the show ends, and they're on to another location. Or maybe they lost him, and they're like oh well. HE WAS RIGHT THERE, stay there and continue the investigation. Follow where you last saw it. You just might get more evidence. Stay a week, a month, whatever it takes. There was one episode where they spot something possibly bipedal in a field on thermal, and Matt makes his way towards it...while Bobo who is filming stays planted instead of also walking closer to it to get a better view, and we never see the shot of the thing walking away. So we're only left to wonder.

Frustrations aside, it's still the best bigfoot investigation show out there, and it's pretty darn good at that. I wish there were many many more episodes, and I will buy every volume that is released. After watching the first season, I started all over and re-watched it again. Very entertaining!",1406937600,9,2483,4.807962529274005
5340193,3,B009INALQS,"Well, they really have not found him yet.

The show is quite fun at times - like when they talk to witnesses and recreate encounters - and a bit boring at times, like when they wander around at night in the forest making noise and don't find anything.

In my view, Renae is often too critical of the evidence (no, it is not likely to be some guy in a rented gorilla suit playing games way out in the middle of nowhere; let's be reasonable here), and Matt at times seems to not be critical enough.

Still, all in all, I personally think the evidence is there that Bigfoot actually exists. Thus, I watch and for the most part enjoy the program.",1401148800,3,642,4.245901639344262
