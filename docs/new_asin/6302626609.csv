8081364,5,6302626609,"Mitsou, a French Canadian singer, was not wellknown in the States.  Her single, ""Bye Bye Mon Cowboy"" was released for US airplay in the dance scene and was accompanied by the infectious video, remixed by Shep Pettibone. The song has stuck with me all these years!! This remixed version was not released to my knowledge, but at times can be found on the music sites for downloading.  The sound is definitely late 80s, early 90s!

This video collection includes four complete videos by Mitsou.  (1) Dis-Moi, Dis Moi (2) Deep Kiss (3) Heading West & (4) Bye Bye Mon Cowboy (Remix Version).  Each video is worth seeing and the songs are extremely listenable - even if you don't understand french!!  Prepare yourself for some minor nudity - as Mitsou does not think nudity is shameful (For herself & her male dancers) but it's all in good taste.  In addition, you are treated to behind the scenes footage & candid interviews with the singer (in english!).",1109462400,,950,4.721212121212122
