8599953,1,B007Q4XEJW,"There were no English subtitles in the last episode, and not even a Korean soundtrack.  It was dubbed in Chinese, period.  What subtitles there were in the previous episodes were so bad, that it was hard to follow the plot or figure out who was who, aside from the main characters.  I suspect that the translator was not fluent in either English OR Korean!  Picture quality was barely adequate, and poor in action scenes. Looks like it was several generations away from the original.  I'm only sorry that I got all the way to the last episode, before I discovered that you can watch it online at good drama.net -- with better picture & decent subs.  I backed up several episodes, things finally started making sense and it became clear how many of the DVD subtitles were just plain wrong!",1397952000,,788,4.5928571428571425
