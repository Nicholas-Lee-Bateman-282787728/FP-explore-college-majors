8473908,4,B005HWQWXA,"Watched my copy the other night and this was good. I love asian horror and myself being filipino I try to get filipino horror into mmy collection. Not much out there in the filipino market for horror as I only have 14 in my collection. The best overall filipino horror so far that I've watched is ""The Road"", then I would put ""Tumbok"" second so far. I haven't watched all 14 in my collection but that's where I put this one in. We have a great actress with great looking attributes that kept my attention. The story is pretty good also with a nice twist at the end. Starts off like it's a ghost story but later evolves to its true nature of the story. Has pretty good scares with a cute little hottie...what's not to like?",1420675200,,722,4.2773722627737225
