6437330,5,B00KOW4BB8,Very Good And A lot To Learn I Love Martin Clune's We Watch Him Everyday Never get Tired of His Shows or Movies Glad And Happy I Bought This,1417996800,2,140,3.8620689655172415
6437331,5,B00KOW4BB8,"Especially loved the work horses and how they were trained for the plowing/sewing of his own land.  They are such beautiful animals.
Because I lived in South Africa I was saddened by the ending of the lioness who was killed in the wild, as so many years of planning.",1414886400,4,266,4.428571428571429
6437332,5,B00KOW4BB8,Love this series. Great for all animal lovers.,1414281600,,46,4.875
6437333,5,B00KOW4BB8,"We know him best as the gruff, blunt Doc Martin but Martin Clunes, an elegant and versatile actor, is your genial host, conversational and fun, in this collection of documentary specials. Horses, dogs, lemurs and lions plus more all take center stage, and Clunes informs, entertains and educates us on the wonders of animals in our world. Special treat is a visit to his own Dorset farm, with his own two beautiful Clydesdales, and Clunes, who has served as president of the British Horse Society, discusses the role of working horses. You'll never see Doc Martin the same way again! The scenery and creatures are breathtaking, and you'll learn surprising and fun facts. This is a DVD set you'll revisit and cherish.",1409788800,20,716,4.877049180327869
6437334,5,B00KOW4BB8,"When Martin Clunes plays Doc Martin in that TV series, he hates animals. Good actor, but in real life he's a kid-in-a-toy-shop around animals. He puts his love for animals and his camera presence to good use as he presents fun and facts about animals in this enjoyable and educational documentary that takes him around the world. It is as good as any animal documentary I have viewed. Highly recommended for all ages. Even toddlers, though not understanding the content, will enjoy the animal footage.

SDH SUBTITLES provided. Some real-life graphic animal attack scenes.
A MAN AND HIS DOGS -a 2 part/episode program
Kent, Devon, Africa, Australia, & American Rocky Mts are visited looking for ancestry to Clunes's pets. The Doc loves his dogs (Mary, Arthr & Tina). All dogs are 99% wolf. Why? How did wolves become domesticated? Aussie dingoes are sacred to Outback Aborigines. A rat killing scene.
Search dogs to sheep dogs; hunting to herding; dogs have benefited the lives of man. Cumbria, Montana, & Eastern Africa visits help fine out if the dogs have equally gained. See a dog's hip replacement.

HEAVY HORSEPOWER
Clunes owns 2 working Clydesdales. Horses also get bred for leisure or racing. Work horses get visited in an Italian vineyard, Belgium coast (shrimpers), Indiana Amish farm, and even in a New Orleans parade. Working horses are impressive and large.

MAN TO MANTA
An Indian Ocean island is a good spot to search for the Manta ray, a creature of much interest to Clunes. One slight problem; like Doc Martin's inability to deal with blood, the actor Clunes has a real-life underwater anxiety.

THE LEMURS OF MADAGASCAR
Death is closing in on Madagascar lemurs. A good look at endangered wildlife. Is there hope to save them? 17 lemur species are already only history-forever. A seldom seen look inside the remaining Madagascar rainforest.

A LION CALLED MUGIE
Clunes helps in a project intended to return lions to a Kenyan reserve. A new lion cub is hoped to be released in the area and camp made famous in the book/film `Born Free.' Not exactly the ending intended. Such is often the case with nature, but it's all captured on film.",1409270400,9,2151,4.882191780821918

especially if there are any chasing or running or just showing animals in their natural habitat. A funny situation we have
not encountered before. Rin Tin Tin and Lassie never acted this way but they did not have such things as TV for entertainment

6437396,4,B00KOW4BB8,"Having read the other reviews, I felt I wanted to write one.  I noted that the negative review was from someone with an 'academic' e-mail address - that perhaps explains the review.  Part of the appeal of this series in my view is Martin Clunes' wonderment at the animals and their world.  At a time when we are all probably somewhat cynical about a number of things, I felt the series brought a refreshing and educational look at serious issues.  One laughed, one became emotional (or at least I did), but one also thought about the content.  The animals themselves were delightful, and one can have nothing but respect for those of Martin's contacts, such as with Mugie, who show such commitment.  I greatly appreciate Martin Clunes' work, dramatic and otherwise, (also his wife's work as a producer) and will keep an eye out for more...",1454889600,5,839,4.712328767123288

6437401,3,B00KOW4BB8,"I only made it halfway through Eps. 1 and turned it off.  Just too much about himself.  Clune should take the camera out of his own face more and keep it to his subject.  We really don't need close-ups of his animated delight to cue our emotions as if we are school children. Quite artless.

I'm afraid I stopped watching at the point where Shaun (the wolf owner) presented us that harrowing scene of himself among the wolves at feeding, and Clune cuts to his own giggling expression and boyish delight as if the event were a spectacle for his entertainment, when clearly something deeply primal, raw and riveting about nature was happening before us.  Is he so clueless?  That scene was something I've never seen, nor surely will you have.  I truly expected Shaun to stand up among his snarling beasts and quietly ask Clune if he mightn't rather contain himself. He clearly was just a spectator missing significance what he was being shown, a tourist to his own production. But he was sure to get his face in the lens and show us the delight we should be feeling.

I might have loved to watch more but could no longer stand the childishness.  Maybe the series is aimed at school children. Wish the descriptions had said so.",1452297600,3,1224,4.552511415525114

8660487,5,B00KOW4BB8,"I loved Martin Clunes in Doc Martin and after watching this documentary I realize just how great an actor he is.  He plays such a withdrawn and uptight character and really makes you believe it.  But you can see how genuinely kind and warm he is in this documentary about animals.  He does a really good job presenting the information and makes you feel like you are there with him.  I would buy every one that has been made in this series.  Hopefully, more shows will be released here in the U.S.  With all the garbage that is on TV it is good to know there is still really great TV out there.",1503705600,,594,4.212389380530974
