3005952,5,B000XSKDQA,an excellent product at a perfect price with a FAST delivery time.  as a Vietnam Veteran this DVD highlights most all of the 96 Vietnam War Aircraft and is a fine addition to my Vietnam Documentary library.,1399248000,4,206,4.5675675675675675
3005953,4,B000XSKDQA,"This is a pretty good film if you are in to Vietnam aircraft. The video is grainy (what would you expect from the time it was shot though), and everything has cheesy music laid on top. The narrator is decent. The footage however, is great! You're not gonna see too many kills, but you will see lots of bombs going off from altitude, aircraft carrier landings, and even some Migs getting missled down. Not the greatest documentary on earth but worth the price and watch in my opinion.",1357084800,4,483,4.5
3005954,5,B000XSKDQA,"This DVD has a lot of actual footage.  That means that the picture quality is not good, but it is authentic.  Narrative seems to be very accurate.  You will see some aircraft that I have not seen actual footage of before like the T-28 and the A-26A (B-26K).  Also some nice footage of the RF-101C Voodoo.  Plus of course lots of footage of the F-4 Phantom and the F-105 Thunderchief.  Worth every penny at this price!",1310947200,9,417,4.421052631578948
