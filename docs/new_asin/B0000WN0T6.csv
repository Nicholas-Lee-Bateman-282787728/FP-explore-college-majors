1958010,5,B0000WN0T6,My daughter watched this one night on t.v. and thoroughly enjoyed it! We searched all over for this DVD and finally found it! She was thrilled recieving it and watches it again & again!,1170547200,,185,4.470588235294118
1958011,5,B0000WN0T6,"This is a fabulous movie, from beginning to end, making epic movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Gone with the Wind"", and ""The Guns of Navarone"" look like Bugs Bunny cartoons.  John Goodman portrays the noble Fred, but Rosie is everything you would want her to be.  Glamorous, witty, sexy, charming, and above all, realistic in her portrayal of a cartoon cavewoman.  It's easy to see how the fiesty Rosie wound up on ""The Veiw"".

This inspired portrayal of the sensitive Betty Rubble, should have at least won an Academy Award nomination.  After all, millions of American elementary school kids think of Rosie as Betty Rubble, not as a comic actress! Since no academy award nomination took place I can only applaud for exposing the vanity of paunchy males with stupid looking hairdo.

You go Girl!",1168732800,,785,4.82089552238806
1958012,3,B0000WN0T6,If you are a Flintstone fan - the first movie is a treat - bringing the characters to life and reminding us of the original story line.  The sequel can be tossed.,1162771200,,162,4.0625
1958013,5,B0000WN0T6,Rosie O'Donnell is Great. She is the best Actress around. I grew up with the Flinstones as a kid. That's why I enjoy this.,1153008000,,122,4.125
1958014,4,B0000WN0T6,It is a real treat to see the flinstones first live action film if you are a fan of the cartoon series. It is a film that adults and children can enjoy together. The town of Bedrock looks great and it looks like it does in the cartoalso good playing the role ofon show. John Goodman was an excellent choice for the role of Fred. Rick Morranis is also does a good job portraing the role of Barney. The rest of the cast is also good. You also see Halley Berry have small role in the film. The sequel is not that great because the sequel is a prequel. I am not a big fan of prequels and not a fan of this one either. There is not alot of star power in this film. The kid will enjoy more than the adults. But it is kind of interesting to see how Fred and Willma first met and how they get their pet Dino. All an all this is good family fun for you and your child.,1097193600,5,859,3.8587570621468927

1958034,5,B0000WN0T6,"Both live action Flintstones movies in one DVD at a low price. Is most convenient. If you liked the original you'll also enjoty the second movie, even if it's a prequel. Both movies include trailers and making of documentaries which are a must see.
My copy had a slightly different packaging as the box's illustration was gray resembling rocks and didn't have the baby Dino on the cover. Nevertheless a must for all Flintstones fans of any age.",1254787200,5,444,4.705128205128205

8004131,3,B0000WN0T6,I love both these films the production  alive in them is excellent and  wry enjoyable to watch for nostalgia :) however my DVD on the Rock Vegas side has scratch that came with it and doesn't let the movie play past a certain part so I have to go back to the menu and do scene select to skip the scratched part/error to finish it. ThAts why I did theee stars otherwise id do 5.,1513814400,,377,4.013333333333334
8004132,4,B0000WN0T6,"like so much else in this world, the concept of ""critical distance"" sounded fine in theory, only to fall apart in practice. specifically, that means that the established fanbase is liable to be biased, so the dispassionate reviewer who isn't necessarily a devotee is the one more likely to make an accurate assessment.
i for one am living proof that the logic here is faulty. for instance, i absolutely venerate The Beatles, yet i recognized the Bee-Gees led ""tribute"" film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band for the messy misfire that it was. similarly, my immense obsession with Sherlock Holmes and his world is exactly what enabled me to see how badly Charlton Heston was miscast in The Crucifer Of Blood. in both cases i really wanted to like it but just wouldn't click.
the truth is that the established devotees are the ones who'll get what such a revival/tribute is going for and will recognize whether it works or not. the all-time example just might be The Flintstones, which just might of taken the year's heaviest, most vitriolic beating from the critics, yet is fondly remembered by the fans for whom it was made in the first place.
said critics blew much of it's alleged wretchedness way out of proportion. much was made of it centering on ""adult"" subject matter - office politics, sexual flirtation, in-law squabbles - which they assumed would be over the heads of children. well as it happens, these are all issues that came up from time to time in the cartoon series. for about 25 years the series had aired predominantly in the ""children's hour"" of before or after school and survived. obviously the kids who saw it then figured these things out. so basically, it's based on a textbook assumption that kids are morons.
another thing they conveniently neglected to mention is that it hadn't been designed as a kid's show. as originally posited - and (in)famously modeled on The Honeymooners - it was basically a sitcom, and in fact made history by being the first ever prime-time animated series. it was quite a departure from it's creator(s) Hanna-Barberra's established realm of Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound, which was palpable even in my own childhood, when it tended to air in the company of He-Man and Transformers.
another thing that became an issue of ludicrous proportions is the fact that there were ""writers"" beyond the three credited. the story got around that there were 32 writers. some critic or other inevitably suggested that they ""needed a 33rd.""
this, i suspect, is a simple misunderstanding. it most likely refers to is a practice that's been standard on comedy series since tv began (and probably dates back to radio as well): one or two of the writing staff have worked out the basic story, but the entire staff contributes witticisms or ""bit of business"" for the cast to work with. so i suspect the overflow was of GAG writers rather than PLOT writers.
if you can manage to look beyond all that - and i daresay all you have to do is not be a professional critic - you'll no doubt find a healthy serving of the good-spirited fun always demanded from such a film. so what if the plot(s) is/are off the rack? nobody asked it to break any new ground. (how much cinematic ground is even left to be broken, anyway?) it came early in the movement of cinematic revivals of vintage tv series and was held up as a poster-child of the ""evils"" of this movement, but actually stands as one of the better examples.
you come to see a film like to to reacquaint with old friends, as it were, and that, the acid test, is passed with flying colors. we get not one but two exemplary ensembles who clearly revel in the fun of the most outlandish roles any of them are ever likely to play. John Goodman and Mark Addy both faultlessly reflect the textbook gruff lovability one associates with Fred Flinstone, and are ably complemented by equally faithful composites of naive but loyal Barney Rubble. one by Rick Moranis in what could be his last film appearance before retiring, the other by Stephen Baldwin in a surprising departure from typically rougher types such as he played in The Usual Suspects. (especially considering that brother Alec has since come to be regarded as the family clown.) by the sequel, even The Great Gazoo gets to join in the fun. fittingly, the man who originally voiced the avuncular space sorcerer, Harvey Korman, is the one actor who managed to appear in both films. first he voices the ""dictatbird,"" then he plays Wilma's father.
so okay, it's no Gone With The Wind. well guess what? not only was it not trying to be a Gone With The Wind, but that's not what the fans would've wanted it to be.",1508198400,,4648,4.683374083129585
