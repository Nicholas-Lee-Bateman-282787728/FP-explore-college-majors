I was lucky to catch it on YouTube but I may be buying this in near future for my collection",1410220800,5,190,4.305555555555555
5048854,5,B0071N879K,"Great movie and historically corrected highly recommend it, having lived on Saipan and knowing its history this is a must watch movie for any WWll history buff",1394755200,5,159,4.925925925925926
5048855,3,B0071N879K,"The movie was about the battle of Saipan and remnants of the Japanese army, led by Captain OBA, that held out and continued to wage guerrilla operations for over a year before finally surrendering.  I just felt that the movie didn't not really capture the true horrors especially  for the fact there were so many Japanese civilians on the island at the time of the battle.  Considering the large contingent of Japanese civilians and the fact that it was a Japanese production company, I was surprised at how much of the movie focused on the American point of view.  Being an American in the military and a history major, I found a story taken from the other side, very interesting.  However, this movie, like so many others, only partially captured the human-side of the story. BTW I got to play an extra in the movie as a Marine.",1373241600,8,830,4.581081081081081
5048856,4,B0071N879K,"This is the story of the last remnants of the Japanese army in Saipan that fought a long guerrilla warfare campaign against the American army for about 16 months. I found it a fascinating story. The story is good and what I can see on the web is fairly accurate. I liked very much the subplots of the attitudes of many of the Japanese people in that conflict.  The characters are interesting.

The acting was good. Yutaka Takenouchi who played Capt 'ba did it well.

The filming is not breath taking but good enough.

If you are interested in WW2, then I would say it is a must see.",1340496000,12,582,4.3119266055045875
8508505,3,B0071N879K,"I bought this movie in Blu-ray format.  The description says its in English.  However, when playing the only options are German and a Japanese.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Ill rate it a three right now, as indecisive.",1529539200,,225,4.6923076923076925
8508506,5,B0071N879K,Great story from the Japanese perspective but the portrayal of the Americans is still fair.,1526515200,,91,5.133333333333334
8508507,4,B0071N879K,In war OBA maintained honor and did what he could given the dire condition his task was towards the end of the war in confronting overwhelming American superiority in both numbers manpower wise  and quality of equipment. He held out as long as possible while trying to protect the civilians under his care and was not a fanatic suicidal officer for himself and for his men under his command as well as the civilians who were seeking protection from him.,1526083200,,453,4.6625
8508508,5,B0071N879K,One of the best movies Ive ever seen. I finally decided to buy it after renting it from Netflix for the fourth time.,1518480000,,116,4.086956521739131
8508509,5,B0071N879K,Bought this DVD for my husband for his birthday as he is a history buff and wanted to see this DVD.  He absolutely loved it!  He's watched it several times.  We don't know how accurate historically it was but it was very informative and entertaining.,1501891200,2,250,4.511111111111111
8508510,5,B0071N879K,"Battle of the Pacific or Oba The Last Samurai was quite a surprise for me. This was a sleeper. The story starts a little slow but then develops into a fascinating piece of WWII history. Based on the true story of Captain Sakae ba, who together with a handful of his fellow soldier survivors held out on the island of Saipan for 512 days. His was the last organized resistance of Japanese forces of the Second World War. At first, Oba tries to ignore a few hundred Japanese civilians also hiding on the island mountain. They are using Mount Tapochau as a base due to its natural defensive position and prominent heights overlooking every possible approach. They believe that they will be executed by the Americans if they surrender. But Captain Oba quickly transforms assumes responsibility for the safety of the civilians while also conducting a guerilla war against the Americans who just want them all to surrender. Oba was nicknamed ""the Fox"" by the Americans due to his cunning strategy. And the American negotiators are led by a marine captain with familiarity of Japanese customs (lived in Tokyo before the war) that he must constantly explain to his gung ho marine commanders. Gives you a real feel for both sides of the conflict. The transformation of Oba toward ultimate surrender is explored nicely. Great scenes, not fancy but very interesting and believable. A must see for war movie fans.",1477958400,,1401,4.841666666666667

8508513,5,B0071N879K,"I agree with fellow reviewer Soni.  This is a 2011 movie that I watched for free on You Tube, Full length.  While I had some difficulty trying to stay with it in the first half of the film, the end really pays off.  So be patient with it.  The first half is kind of your regular WW2 flick with all the bombs, explosions, death and destruction. But the 2nd half really has some heartfelt stuff that would have anyone's emotions going.  In the first half I was a little turned off by the acting (and the ACTOR) of the commanding American Colonel, but once you get through the entire flick you get a sense of why his role was what it was meant to be.  The lead Japanese actor who plays Captain Oba has a very strong performance. This movie jarred my memory of other WW2/Pacific war movies of the past, most notably a Frank Sinatra film called ""None but the Brave."" But it also has elements of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" among others.  I liked this movie so much that now I want to research the subject in detail to find out the true story of the last days of the battle on Saipan. Most of us history buffs are already aware of the suicide jumps off the cliffs by Japanese civilians who thought the Americans were going to torture or kill them. But their is always more to the real story.

One thing that has me a bit puzzled is the production of this film. How did both countries co-work together to get it accomplished? The USA and Japan are strong allies today, but still, how did they do it so that it respects both sides of the war?  In the opening credits you do see  a TOHO production if that helps at all.  Not sure, but anyway I have said enough.  One final note I learned is that this film has many titles but it is the same movie.  ""OBA, The Last Samurai""  AKA ""Battle of the Pacific""  Heck, to save time here is a paste from Wiki: Oba: The Last Samurai ( - Taiheiy no kiseki: Fokkusu to yobareta otoko?), also known as Miracle of the Pacific, Battle of the Pacific and Codename: Fox, is a 2011 Japanese World War II Pacific War drama film directed by Hideyuki Hirayama.
I will recommend this hidden gem to all my friends that are WW2 history buffs like me.",1459468800,3,2168,4.228155339805825
