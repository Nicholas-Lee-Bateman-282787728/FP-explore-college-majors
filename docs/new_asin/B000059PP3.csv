1408113,3,B000059PP3,"THE CAT O'NINE TAILS
[Il Gatto a Nove Code]

(Italy/France/W.Germany - 1970)

Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Cromoscope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo-thriller in the same vein as its forerunner, and he managed to secure the services of celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden (fresh from his appearance in PATTON [1969]) and rising star James Franciscus (TV's ""Longstreet""). The resulting film, which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than its predecessor, must be considered a disappointment. In fact, it's no more than a routine potboiler, impeccably photographed and punctuated by a number of stylish set-pieces, but too plodding and aimless for general audience consumption.

Malden plays a blind ex-journalist who overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with fellow reporter Franciscus to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of the rampaging killer. Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE [1969]) plays the daughter of a wealthy geneticist (Tino Carraro), initiating a romance with Franciscus which amounts to little more than unnecessary padding (incredibly, Spaak has maintained an active screen career since the mid-1960's, most recently appearing in Adriano Wajskol's JOY SCHERZI DI GIOIA [2002]). More successful as a team, Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE [1972]) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds.

Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (brilliantly edited, as usual, by Euro-cult stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and an episode in which Malden and Franciscus break into a tomb at midnight in search of an important clue, only to find themselves in mortal peril...

But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. It's no surprise that CAT failed to emulate the runaway success of CRYSTAL PLUMAGE when released in 1971.",1034726400,4,2372,5.611731843575419
1408114,4,B000059PP3,"Second movie of the ""animal title serie"" of italian director Dario Argento, the 1971 THE CAT O'NINE TAILS is a giallo, a term coming from the color of a serie of italian mystery books published in the early sixties. A special aesthetics, sex and gory murders characterize this peculiar genre.
Karl Malden, as a blind former journalist, does a terrific job in the movie that has some scenes worthy to appear in an anthology. I particularly liked the scene in the cemetery when James Franciscus is locked in a vault with a dozen coffins. Several years later, Dario Argento would have put some horror ingredients in the scene such as the resurrection of one of the dead but in THE CAT O'NINE TAILS, only the claustrophobic mood of the situation interested him.
I've also liked the artisanal special effects created by Argento which are, in my opinion, as scary and efficient as those generated nowadays by our beloved computers. The italian director shows with his technical skill that he is really Mario Bava's spiritual son.
Anchor Bay's DVD is superb with images without a single white or black spot and a sound that respects the interesting musical score of Ennio Morricone. Extra-features are, for once in an Anchor Bay DVD, multiple. French, italian and english versions, radio spots, trailers, recorded 1971 interviews of Karl Malden and James Franciscus and an indispensable video interview of Dario Argento and Ennio Morricone. A must.

1408115,3,B000059PP3,"In the early 70's at Thule Air Base the main activity aside from drinking was going to the movies. A thriller called The Bird With The Crystal Plumage caught my fancy. Then some months later we saw Cat o'Nine Tails. I immediately recognized the director's style but found the movie lacking. My interest in Argento was revived when 4 Flies on Grey Velvet came along.
3 decades later, I've just seen Anchor Bay's stunning reissue of Cat which confirmed my original assessment - stylish, funny ... but lacking the element of suspense or surprise to be found in both Bird and Flies. The cast is excellent.. The DVD is superb with an interesting group of extras including an interview with Argento and radio interviews with Franciscus and Malden. I do recommend the DVD but if you're on a budget, wait for a reissue of 4 Flies or run to your local DVD store today and snap up Deep Red.
Incidentally, since I've been acquainted with Argento's films for so many years, I'm surprised all Americans don't know them. Cat o'Nine Tails just lacks the edge to be found in the rest of his works. Certainly if you like giallo flicks, you'll want to see it at least once.",1004918400,,1155,4.5576923076923075

1408117,1,B000059PP3,"Be advised - DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!! It has to be the worse DVD I've ever seen. Firstly, it's not widescreen (the kiss of death to an Argento film). Secondly it has probably the worse picture quality I've ever had the misfortune to witness. Finally, it is very heavily cut.
The movie itself is good but it's utterly ruined on this DVD.
Avoid this and get the new DVD release instead.
I should have realised that this was too good a bargain at this price. AVOID!!!",1000684800,6,463,4.333333333333333
1408118,3,B000059PP3,"After hearing the reviews for THE CAT O"" NINE TAILS i did not have high expectations for this film though it actually turned out to be a little better than i expected though not enough. A blind puzzle maker (Karl Malden) overhears two men disscussing something one night in front of a genetics building and later that night the guard of the building is assualted and something from the building is stolen. Soon after the puzzle maker joins with a newspaper reporter (James Franciscus) to find out who committed the robbery and soon after as a result of their snooping a series of murders are committed to cover up the tracks of the theif and along the way the reporter begins an affair with the daughter (Catherine Spaak) of the owner of the building. This was the second of Argento's animal trilogy. The first was THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE and the third which Paramount is considering releasing is FOUR FLIES ON GRAY VELVET and it's also Argento's second film. Argento himself said he hated this film though it's not as bad as all that. The dubbing is what you normally expect from this kind of film. The acting is uneven. James Franciscus is stiff at times as is Catherine Spaak. Karl Malden does a competent enough job though at times it feels like he is not in enough of the movie. Catherine's role is not substantial enough, she's mostly there as eye candy. The direction is unusually restrained for an Argento film and surprisngly there is almost no violence in this movie which is extremely unusual in Argento's movies. Also the script is pretty bad. The story could have worked but instead it becomes uninvolving, the dialogue is stupid at times and a few plot devices are a little hard to believe. The saving graces though are the scenes of suspense which are good enough and Ennio Morricone's music for this movie which is actually very beautiful but it seems like he should have come up with more music for this movie. This movie is mostly a curiousity for Argento fans if you want to see Argento when he was just starting to develop as a director.",997574400,4,2068,4.607046070460704
1408119,5,B000059PP3,"Finally this makes its way to America uncut and in a gorgeous transfer.
This isn't Argento's best but his development as a filmmaker is obvious.  Many memorable scenes, including a brutal, tense-filled final 15 minutes and a great end for the mad killer.
Argento's direction and camera compostions are brilliant and have so clearly influenced later filmmakers like John Carpenter and David Fincher.  But there's only one Argento.
Anchor Bay did a great job with this disc.  Fans will drool.  Now just patiently wait for ""Susperia"" and the grand ""Opera"".",995673600,3,553,5.111111111111111

1408121,5,B000059PP3,"THis is one of Dario's best efforts.  This is almost the best film out of his early works besides the Bird with the Crystal Plumage.  An excellent story with some of the most exquiste sets and lighting schemes you will ever see.  There is a gory ultra-realistic death by train sequence that will beckon you to rewind it several times to make sure it wasn't real!  A great tale told by the master, read no more, pick this one up today and watch it as soon as you get it, you won't be disspointed especially if you want to know more about the master Dario Argento or what classic giallo's are all about. enjoy!",991872000,4,608,4.307017543859649

Of course, loved the scenery and the entire experience!  I have a 10 dvd collection with more on the way!  They have enhanced our workouts by making indoor cycling seem shorter and interesting.  Would recommend to couples, families and singles!

Indoor cyclists have complained about the car speed being too fast!  Please do not slow down the speed . . . I think it's great.  If you've ever seen the slower films they are so ho-hum.

1408185,1,B000059PP3,"I was quite surprised by the discrepancy between the enthusiastic review of the Anchor Bay purchasers and my very dismal personal experience; research on Wikipedia enlightened me! I realized that my edition by Diamond Entertainment was actually a truncated one. This is how Wikipedia describes it:
""The 2005 DVD release by Diamond Entertainment, as part of their ""Slasher Collection"", is listed on their box as being ""fully restored"" with a running time of 112 minutes. But the disc actually contains a poor quality pan and scan print, with over 20 minutes missing resulting in a running time of under 89 minutes. The print appears to be an old Warner Brothers edited television print with extensive additional footage missing.""
Indeed, the picture is grainy, fuzzy, with extremely poor definition and sound; in no way does it seem to originate from a ""fully restored and enhanced digital master"" as purported on the back of the case. In several instances, the narrative is choppy and lacks continuity since scenes were cut. My viewing experience was very mediocre and frustrating, not at all enjoyable.
That edition is merely a waste of viewing time and money: avoid it!",1395014400,5,1171,5.072538860103627
1408186,3,B000059PP3,"The scenes are beautiful, but the speed of the vehicle from which the recording was done, is TOO HIGH. It corresponds to a car, truck or motorcycle, no even close to a bicycle. You can never pickup a rhythm.",1393545600,2,207,4.333333333333333

1408188,4,B000059PP3,"I watch TV as I ride my stationary bike. I saw the list of DVD's offered by Bike O Vision and after looking over the reviews, decided to buy the Yellowstone Park ride. The scenery on the DVD is really great which is to be expected since it is Yellowstone. The music is good, but I listen to faster songs on my MP3 player when I ride. I like how they occasionally stop to show you wildlife as well as other natural wonders as the ride progresses. The DVD has several rides within the park, with each one having its own title. It would have nice if Bike O Vision would have shown the ride on a map to show you where you were located in the park. The only problem I have with the DVD is the speed of the vehicle taping the ride. It seems as if you are going 25 to 35 mph. It would have been great if they could have gone slower to make the ride more bike like.

I would still recommend this DVD or any of their series for people who ride stationary bikes and would like to watch something else other than TV shows.",1385856000,2,1011,4.0049504950495045

1408222,4,B000059PP3,"I bought 4 of these: Yellowstone, Pacific Coast Highway, Arches & Capitol Reef, and Yosemite & Death Valley.  All of them are Blu Ray.  I was looking for something to watch while riding my trainer to forestall the boredom of a 60 minute workout.  I have the 40 inch wide-screen right in front of me so with the 16 x 9 aspect you get a good sense of the ride.

I have only a few criticisms of these.

1. On most of these videos the camera vehicle (motorcycle) was going much too fast.  Through Yellowstone I guess almost 35 mph.
2. I was hoping for a few more turnouts to check out the scenery.  Great scenery by the way.
3. For Blu Ray HD video I expected a bit more detail and sharpness.  I would guess it was shot in 720p since the stills that are edited-in are razor sharp.
4.  Even though the music was not too bad, one or more alternate sound tracks would be cool.
5. The Pacific Coast Highway was a bit boring along with Death Valley which was very boring.

I was not looking for a split-screen with a workout-trainer barking at me or one of those high energy training videos that are out there.  This is exactly what I was looking for; great scenery, exotic places, high definition video.  It would be cool if in the future they could put a little box in the corner telling speed though.  Also slow it down to realistic bicycle speeds.

My favorite so far has been Arches National Park although Yellowstone and Yosemite were beautiful too.  Pacific Coast Highway got a bit monotonous ... lots and lots of ocean.",1357776000,5,1518,4.333333333333333

1408224,5,B000059PP3,"Contrary to what the other reviewer wrote about a lack of wildlife, I thought this dvd was simply great!  The bison you encounter are at first off in the distance, and you're thinking ""oh, that's kind of neat"" but then Whoa!- you encounter them face to face, actually stopping you for a moment!  Its incredible to be so close to such an iconic western wild animal, actually hearing their snorts and seeing them all around you and then whoosh! you're off again pedaling through more colorful, awesome scenery.
Besides elk (with huge antlers!), bison, chipmunks and such, I saw a beautiful pelican floating by down the river, which is certainly unusual for such an inland location.  I found all the geological and natural features to be interesting and well-placed so as to not interrupt what turns out to be a hearty workout, too.

1408225,4,B000059PP3,"Even though ""Cat 'o Nine Tails"" is widely known as one of Dario Argento's least favorite films that he's made in his career (he felt it was ""too much like American cinema,"" and that's not far from the truth.  the problem I have with such a quote is that this little neglected film of Argento's is pure cinema at its finest!
Both Karl Malden and James Franciscus are a great team in this whodoneit mystery! yeah, it may look a bit dated, but that is the charm of this film, it takes you back to a simpler, yet very violent past.  Ennio Morricone's hauntingly beautiful score accompanies you through a maze of unexpected horrors, a rarity in today's flash cut cinema.
  The transfer is first rate, considering the age of the filmstock, wonderful cinematography from beginning to end. the extras are fair, was hoping to get an insightful commentary track, but everything else here should please any Argentophile! I've had the original Anchor Bay dvd, which also had a great picture, but this one easily surpasses it in many ways!

The music could have been much more uplifting - instead of the constant drone of tymp' drums that kept rising so that you expected to come across an exciting scene when the crescendo was reached only to be disappointed when nothing of note appeared.  If I had never before had the pleasure of driving through this beautiful Park, this video would NOT entice me to plan a trip there anytime soon!  Maybe there was no other wildlife around at the time this video was shot - but another trip through with some addtional shots of wildlife - which IS there - added to this video would have made it more fun.",1301961600,,812,4.517006802721088

I purchased this film because Dario Argento

that I could not go wrong
(not necessarily a good assumption,
having seen the awful ""Phantom of the Opera"").

It is a crime drama, a murder mystery,
an Italian Giallo film by the master of the genre.

There are a number of interesting characters.

The musical score,
composed by the great Ennio Morricone

I enjoy viewing the film repeatedly to

1408271,5,B000059PP3,"Dario Argento fans have nothing to fear!  Anchor Bay Entertainment has certainly done justice to this film. The video transfer from Anchor Bay is simply amazing and the digital 2.0 sound is solid. Anchor Bay has given Dario Argento fans The Cat O' Nine Tails in its 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The pristine video transfer is presented in all its re-mastered, uncut and unedited glory.

In my opinion the acting in this movie is outstanding for a rather obscure film from the 1970's. I think all the actors gave a solid performance in their roles and this film kept me guessing until the very end. Karl Malden portrays a blind man (Franco Arno) who used to be a journalist. He now lives with his young niece and spends his time writing crossword puzzles to earn a living.

While out for a stroll one night Arno overhears a conversation between two men and asks his niece to study their faces. The next day a doctor is found dead and Arno contacts (Carlo Giordani) a reporter played by James Franciscus. The two unlikely sleuths will now team up and try to catch a brutal killer on a rampage. Most of the story and action takes place at a research hospital, where the killer tries to conceal the original crime with even more violent murders.

I knew nothing about this movie until I picked it up in a bargain bin at a used DVD store, but it has quickly become one of my favorite movies and I have become a Dario Argento fan. Whether you're a hard-core or casual Argento fan, this movie is definitely worth seeing. As a bonus, some nice extras have been included in this version.

P.S. This movie will make you think twice the next time someone offers you something to drink.

1408272,4,B000059PP3,"As far as the Argento library goes ""The Cat o' Nine Tails"" while not his best film is still very very good. As far as the giallo(Violent Italian murder mysteries)go in general,it is truly one of the very best of it's kind. The thing you've got to understand is that a good Dario Argento film is better than most other Director's great films so with that said,yes this can be considered to be a great film! While it isn't quite up to the artistic level of the works from the meastro's prime era of films such as ""Deep Red""-""Suspiria""-""Inferno""-""Tenebre"" & ""The Opera"" it does still overflow with the fresh skills that he later hoaned to perfection to create those Masterpieces.

1408273,5,B000059PP3,"While most films that fall under the Giallo banner are far more style than substance, this one rises far above all of that.  Among Dario Argento's finest works, it is an eerie psychological thriller which is part Hitchcock, part Raymond Chandler novel, and part Cinecitta.  The story is believable and captivating, the suspense is chilling, the acting is superb.  Of course there's great music, with Ennio Morricone at the helm of the sounds, and of course there's all kinds of good-looking people, cool cars, and stylish set pieces, just as you'd expect from an Italian film from 1970.  But with this film those extras are minor attractions, and the film itself is what keeps you watching.",1157587200,,690,4.922413793103448
1408274,4,B000059PP3,"The second film of the animal trilogy (Bird With The Crystal Plumage(1970), Cat O' Nine Tails(1971) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet(1972)] from legendary director Dario Argento brings us a mystery about Franco Arno a blind puzzle maker who overhears a strange conversation between two men sitting in a parked car in front of a medical institute. That same night someone breaks into the institute and attacks a guard. Franco decides to investigate with newspaper reporter Carlo Giordoni.

While Dario Argento himself didn't care much for this film, fans of his seem to enjoy it. While it doesn't rank up there with his best films there are flashes of brilliance like the black gloved hands of the killer. As with any Argento film, the cinematography is fantastic.

Anchor Bay has a good reputation when it comes to picture quality and this no exception. A fantastic 2.25:1 anamorphic transfer which makes the film look sharper and brighter than it has been for years. Also the copy I own is unrated even though Anchor Bay lists this one as PG. I've never seen the PG version and therefore don't know the difference between the two.

Anchor Bay, where's the DVD for ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet""?",1128470400,5,1190,4.823529411764706
1408275,4,B000059PP3,"I received the DVD for Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971) aka Il Gatto a nove code when I bought a six DVD set from Anchor Bay Entertainment called The Fright Pack: Man's Worst Friends, which also included Parasite (1982), Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat (1989), Slugs: The Movie (1988), Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror (1984), and Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978).  After watching the film, it seemed an odd choice for the set which features movies about animals attacking people, as there was no animals whatsoever in the film, only in the title.  Actually, this was the second of a trio of giallo films made by Argento featuring animals in the title, the others being The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1971).  Written and directed by Dario Argento (Suspiria, Phenomena), the man often referred to at the Italian Hitchcock, this Italia-Franco-German production features Karl Malden (Nevada Smith, Meteor), Catherine Spaak (Murder Is a Murder), Pier Paolo Capponi (Defeat of the Mafia), Horst Frank (The Night of the Askari), Rada Rassimov (Baron Blood), Aldo Reggiani (Young Lucrezia Borgia), Carlo Alighiero (Blade of the Ripper), and James Franciscus (The Valley of Gwangi, Beneath the Planet of the Apes).

Franciscus plays Carlo Giordani, a newspaper reporter who stumbles onto the story of his career (maybe even his life), assisted by an aging blind man, with a penchant for puzzles, named Franco Arnos (Malden) and the man's young niece.  It seems prior to a break-in at a genetics research laboratory, Arno and his niece just happened to in the area, and witnessed something with regards to one of the scientists who works in the facility.  The next day the very same scientist dies horribly as he's pushed, accidentally on purpose, in front of a commuter train.  Giordani, when not making time with the daughter of the man who owns the research facility, learns the company is involved in two secretive, potentially lucrative projects, one involving a miracle drug, and another involving a process for identification of potential criminal tendencies by studying an individual's genetic make-up.  The leads keep popping up, but Giordani and Arno just can't seem to catch a break as the someone keeps brutally dispatching the witnesses before the men get a chance to talk to them...whoever's responsible for the original crime, in which it seemed nothing was taken, is going to great lengths to cover their tracks, even if it means killing...eventually the tables are turned on Giordani and Arno as their snooping draws the attention of the homicidal maniac and soon discover they're now targets.  So who's this homicidal madman?  There's plenty of suspects to choose from...whoever it is, they certainly don't have a problem getting their hands `dirty' with a little manslaughter...

I thought this was a really solid film throughout, with only a couple minor issues.  One thing that surprised me was the excellent production values that went into the movie.  Looks like most of the film was shot on location, which where chosen well.  I thought most all the performers did very well, especially Franciscus and Malden.  I don't know what it is about Franciscus, but he just has a real presence on the screen, one you can't help but feel compelled to keep your eyes on...certainly he's a good looking man, but there is another quality, a vigorous, manly man aspect.  Watch for the scene near the end where he runs face first into a two by four being held by the killer...ouch!  That'll leave a mark...I was impressed with how Argento kept the story moving along as well as he did, given the film is nearly two hours long.  Some of it probably could have been excised, like the element of the storyline about the relationship between the owner of the genetic research facility and his daughter, played by Ms. Spaak.  I'm really unsure what the point of that was, other than perhaps to overly develop the possibility that either one may be the culprit, along with a whole slew of other suspects, or just to creep people out (which it did for me).  The one thing that stood out as the main shortfall involved the revelation of the identity of the maniac killer.  There were no real clues within the story that ever pointed towards any one individual, so when the big reveal occurred, it could have been almost anyone who hadn't yet been killed.  Oh sure, some additional supporting information was given after the fact, things regarding motive and such, but come on, anyone can do that...it's putting sly clues out their prior to the reveal that make a mystery truly fun and engaging to an audience.  This may seem a fairly critical aspect considering this is a mystery, but I felt the majority of the film done well enough to compensate.  I dunno, maybe the breadcrumbs were there, but I neglected to follow.  As far as the deaths go, some get pretty nasty, particularly the guy pushed in front of the train...there's couple of strangulations, a face slashing, attempted poisoning, and more...I think my favorite sequence was when Franciscus' character was in the barbershop getting a shave with a straightedge razor.  The barber is griping about reporters and how the newspapers are speculating that the maniac killer might possibly be a barber, due the proficiency the killer has with a sharp blade.  During this time, we see the barber, through close ups, shaving Franciscus' face and throat, and his unease towards the barber's agitated state.  Another scene I really liked was when Franciscus and Malden are in the graveyard, looking to dig up one of the recently murdered victims in order to follow up on a clue...the fun never ends with these two, I'll tell you what...all in all, a very stylish, sometimes creepy affair with a few vicious murders and a solid storyline.

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides an excellent, `re-mastered, uncut, uncensored', sharp-looking print of the film, in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, on this DVD, along with a decent Dolby Surround 2.0 audio track.  Special features include a featurette titled `Tales of the Cat: interviews with director Dario Argento, writer Dardano Sacchetti, and musical composer Ennio Morricone (14 minutes), two trailers, two TV spots, radio interviews with both Franciscus and Malden (8 minutes each), a poster and still gallery, talent bios, and a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art on an insert in the DVD case, the flipside featuring the chapter stops.  One thing potential buyers should keep in mind is that there are numerous DVD releases of this film out there, and while I have yet to see them, I've rarely been disappointed with the quality on Anchor Bay releases, so even though it may cost a little more, it's probably worth it, in this case, to make sure which release you're thinking of purchasing.

By the way, if I learned anything from this film, it's never to drink from a leaky carton of milk left on my doorstep, especially if a sadistic killer is out to get me...",1127606400,16,7025,4.926271186440678
1408276,3,B000059PP3,"This is a (relatively) spoiler-free review of the ""Cat O'Nine Tails"" DVD.

Despite its lurid box art, Dario Argento's ""Cat"" is actually a 1970s update of Hitchcock. As such, comparisons to Brian DePalma's work are inevitable; DePalma's movies are far more accessible for Americans. Although American actors Karl Malden and James Franciscus are the leads, Argento's European-style direction may make this film a bit harder to appreciate for American audiences. I rather like the European approach, which stresses mood, location shooting, and surreal touches - but if you aren't a fan of European films, you might not like this one.

The plot partially revolves around the friendship between a young reporter (Franciscus) and the blind mentor (Malden) he accidentally meets. The two men collaborate on an investigation into a series of murders that are tenuously connected to a genetics research lab in Italy. Although Argento's film has a loose connection to what was considered cutting-edge science at the time, this isn't a Michael Crichton-style technothriller. Instead, Argento treats us to a classic exercise in ""Giallo,"" Italy's answer to Film Noir.

There are some truly nailbiting moments in the film, including a car chase through Rome's claustrophobic streets and an eerie scene in a crypt at night. All the onscreen murders are sudden and shocking in their violence. I didn't find them gory, but by early 1970s standards they must have been. (This is the uncut version of ""Cat."") The rest of the film, as Argento himself admits, is a potboiler. It's a good way for a mystery or suspense buff to spend nearly 2 hours, but it's not what most people would consider to be timeless stuff.

The English soundtrack has the best sound quality of the three given here (surprising, since the English version is a dub). Subtitles allegedly exist, but my DVD and TV didn't show them even though the option was correctly selected. Otherwise, the extras are nice to have, though not very enlightening.

If you're a suspense/noir buff like I am, you'll enjoy this one and probably add it to your collection. For the rest of you, a rental will suffice.",1124323200,,2146,5.033802816901408
1408277,3,B000059PP3,"I had read somewhere that Dario himself didn't think highly of this film and Maltin rates it a BOMB.  I was sceptical when I rented this one but in the end I was relieved that I did.  It's actually quite good and it has a cohesive plot that keeps you guessing 'till the very end.  There's no gore here to speak of but Argento keeps things lively from start to finish and the actors here are amazingly good (compared to many other Argento films).  Check it out, it certainly doesn't deserve a BOMB rating, and also, it seems that Dario is never entirely satisfied with his old films, apperently he can't even watch them on t.v.",1073865600,15,626,4.370689655172414
1408278,4,B000059PP3,"I had many difficulties to see this movie from Dario Argento because it was not easy to find it in my country, but when I finally saw it, it really surprised me.  Like THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE this second film from the Italian Master of Horror is very impressive. Again Dario used a calculating and very complicated plot, even more than in THE BIRD... This time with more colors and a fabulous score from Ennio Morricone.  A great thriller even if Dario thinks it is his most disappointing film.",1072224000,8,504,4.527472527472527
1408279,4,B000059PP3,"Cat o' Nine Tails is generally considered second-tier Argento.  In fact, Argento himself isn't too jazzed on it.  But I find it to be an excellent Hitchcock-inspired suspense film.  Yeah, it lacks the stylized, highly imaginative visuals of his later films, but that's not to say it lacks filmmaking verve and invention.  Far from it.  A must-have if you're an Argento fan, but I suspect it would have more appeal to a general audience than most of his films.",1044403200,9,459,4.7594936708860756

  Anchor bay Entertainment has provided us with an enriched DVD, full of extras and interesting information. The video is clean and pure, and those colors...so tremendously 70's!!! The audio section comprises three different tracks: English, Italian and French, all of them in Dolby Sorround 2.0.
  The extra features are divided into an interesting interview involving director Dario Argento, writer Dardano Sacchetti and music composer Ennio Morricone, different trailers,TV and radio spots, still gallery and talent bios.

7933874,5,B000059PP3,"Okay, here is an actual review of the new Arrow Blu-ray of Cat O Nine Tails because clearly every other review on this page is not about this release at all - good job Amazon - and the one that purports to be a review of this disc was published on February 1, prior to its release and since the most we get from that ""review"" is it's a new 4k restoration - I don't believe the guy saw the disc at all, which is too frequent a happening here at Amazon.

So, let me be the first to be helpful.  You don't need to hear my thoughts on the film because really who gives a flying Wallenda what I think about the film.  Certainly I don't come to Amazon to read what people think about films because, well, you know.  So, I'll just say this film seems to be the whipping boy of Argento movies of this era, and it's simply because Argento denigrated it at some point - so people read that and then parrot that.  So, for me, I love the film, I like it better that Plumage, the end.

So, the beautiful new 4k restoration.  This isn't a ""restoration"" not if that term is to have any meaning.  It's a new 4k transfer off the film negative, that's what it is.  I have the previous Blue Underground disc and I was relatively happy with it - until I saw this new transfer, which really is that good.  It looks JUST like a dye transfer Technicolor print of a movie shot in Techniscope.  You can't imagine how rare that is because people simply do not understand color.  I read a ""review"" of this transfer that said they prefer the older transfer's color because it's yellow.  Really?  Idiots abound, folks, but I know color, I am an expert in film color, and this one gets it perfectly.  Reds are actually red, not orange/red, blues are blue, etc.  It's as sharp as Techniscope allows, contrast is good, yes it's darker than the previous transfer, which was too light.

So, if you like or love this film you will surely not be disappointed in this new transfer.  It's beautifully done and highly recommended by the likes of me, and yes, I'm the only Amazon reviewer you should EVER listen to. :)",1520899200,12,2078,4.271099744245524
7933875,5,B000059PP3,"Cat O' Nine Tails is a film that I love going back to because for some reason, I never remember many of the details.  I watched the film for the first time in early 2009 when I discovered the wild world of Giallo films.  Since then, I've seen countless gialli and would still call Argento the master.  His ""Animal"" trilogy (which includes this film, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Four Flies on Grey Velvet) are some of the prime examples of the genre and pretty much laid the ground work for many films to come.  It was great to see Arrow release this film in a new limited edition set so I could re-watch it again.

A blind puzzle maker (Karl Malden) and his young niece recognize a man at the scene of a top secret research lab break in shortly before he ""falls"" in front of a train. They go to a newspaper reporter, Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus), to see if they are sure the death was accidental. As it turns out, the death was no accident and soon everyone who tries to help solve the crime ends up dead. Can they solve the crime before they end up victims?

Bravo again for Arrow Video for continually releasing newly remastered versions of some of the greatest cult films of yesteryear.  I can't get enough 70s Italian crime and horror films, and Arrow has been on fire with their selections.  Cat O' Nine Tails is no exception, with a beautiful new 4k restoration and a ton of new bonus features.  If you want to see a prime example of the giallo genre, you can't do much better than this.",1517443200,2,1508,4.338078291814947
7933876,4,B000059PP3,"With the release of THE CAT O'NINE TAILS director Dario Argento was on his way to stardom. Having directed THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE the previous year to critical praise he set out to make a follow up that would include stylistic items that became familiar in almost all of his films.

Blind crossword creator Franco ""Cookie"" Arno (Karl Malden) is walking home with his adopted niece Lori when he overhears a conversation taking place in a car as they walk home, a blackmail attempt being made. He tells Lori to describe who is talking and they continue on. That night the man in the car breaks into a medical research lab and takes something.

Investigating the break in is reporter Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus). At the police station is Franco who overhears Carlo's questioning a detective about the break in. He introduces himself and the pair hit it off, enough so that they begin sharing information in the hopes of solving the case and Carlo getting a scoop out of it.

As the movie carries on the motivations for the break in, the blackmail scheme overheard by Franco and the investigation conducted by Carlo all tie in together. As each piece of evidence is collected or investigated, suspects are murdered or disappear. Those who seem innocent might not be how they appear to be. And eventually the lives of Franco, Lori and Carlo are on the line as the guilty party does everything he can to prevent them from finding out his identity.

The movie is not the best that Argento ever made but it does offer a glimpse into the development of his style, his use of camera and color and his way of depicting the acts committed by his protagonists. In watching his films I noticed that this film tried to take a different approach, focusing less on the murders and more on the original crime involved. From those I've watched it was a direction Argento abandoned, instead going back to the murders instead.

This film also felt more talkie than Argento's previous film, THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, or his subsequent films. As a sophomore outing though he does show that he was developing as a director and the potential was there. Thank goodness it came out with each movie he made.

Some have hailed Argento as the next big thing to come out of Italy when discussing directors and rightfully so to my mind. He was at the forefront of a new wave of Italian directors who focused nearly all of their films in either crime or horror, who made films with little funds and who made use of their limitations to become more artistic and stylistic than many who came before. Without Argento and his substantial success in other countries directors like Fulci might never have been discovered or their films shown in other countries.

Fans of Argento will want to add this to their collection. It's not the first time the film has been released on disc but it is the best edition you will find for the film. That's because Arrow has once again gone out of their way to make this the best edition of the film possible.

To begin with they're offering this film in a 4k restoration from the original camera negative. The extras on hand are also above and beyond what we've had in the past. There is a new audio commentary track by critics Alan Jones and Kim Newman, new interviews with Argento, co-writer Dardana Sacchetti, actress Cinzia De Carolis and production manager Angelo Iacono, script pages for the lost original ending translated into English for the first time, the original Italian and international trailers, a reversible sleeve with new artwork by Candice Tripp, a double sided fold-out poster, 4 lobby card reproductions and a limited edition booklet with illustrations by Matt Griffin that includes an essay on the film by Argento as well as new writings by Barry Forshaw, Troy Howarth and Howard Hughes. Whew! That's a lot of bang for your buck!

If you've never seen the movie I highly recommend it. Not only is it a way to become acquainted with Argento it is a solid film all unto itself. It is entertaining and will keep you guessing as to the identity of the killer. But what else would one expect with a Dario Argento film?",1517270400,,4160,4.656675749318801

7933878,4,B000059PP3,"While its no fan favorite, The Cat O' Nine Tails (1971) is undoubtedly director Dario Argento's most accessible and Americanized production amongst an oeuvre that only become more and more outr.  Fast-tracked to follow-up to his successful The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Argento, still glowing with his new moniker as the ""Italian Hitchcock,"" plunges ahead with his most straight-forward thriller, adding in some signature visual touches but restraining from the usual giallo excess that would become the genre's signature.

The film begins with yet another accidental eyewitness to a crime - or in this case an ear-witness.  Franco Anro (Karl Malden) is a blind ex-newspaperman who spends his retirement years solving crossword puzzles with the help of his 8-year-old niece, Lori.  One night, the pair overhears a suspicious conversation that pulls them into a string of murders at a nearby research clinic.

Reporter Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus) takes advantage of Arno's information - and good intuition - to track down the murder's motives, not realizing that their amateur detective work is also making them a target.  Uncovering a new genetic test that points to violent tendencies, Carlo and Arno narrow their list of suspects to one of the scientists in the clinic who might be trying to cover their own tracks.

While Argento's cinematic reputation has been sullied by a string of terrible movies, his early work shows remarkable technical precision and a strong emphasis on likable characters.  Malden and Franciscus, even if only cast for international appeal, give the film a spit and polish much of the rest of his work lacks.  They're somehow able to bridge the gap between Argento's stylized visual tendencies and the audience's need for an emotional anchor.  Other actors would provide the same services from time to time (David Hemmings in Deep Red comes to mind) but never so successfully.

As the second chapter in the director's unofficial ""Animal Trilogy"" (Four Flies on Grey Velvet being the third), The Cat O' Nine Tails adheres quite well to the newly minted rules of the giallo.  There are a multitude of likely suspects, an equal number of red herrings, one oversexed female (which seems a bit conservative), several brutal but bloodless murders (again, on the conservative side) and a chilling Ennio Morricone score.  While things seem timid by later standards, Argento seems to take more pleasure here in sticking to the plot, avoiding those gory stream-of-consciousness set-pieces that make great highlight reels but don't further the story.  It's still easy to recognize who is behind the camera (fetishized close-ups, dizzying architecture and elaborate dolly shots give that away), but for once he doesn't make himself bigger than the movie.  Whether that's high praise or cheap criticism depends on what kind of Argento movie you're looking for.

The Cat O' Nine Tails has already been released on Blu-ray before, but Arrow Video presents a brand-new 4K restoration from the original camera negative and adds a heaping helping of extras that weren't there on the Blue Underground disc seven years ago.  Look for new interviews with Argeno, co-writer Dardano Sacchetti, actress Cinzia De Carolis and production manager Angelo Iacono plus a new audio commentary with Alan Jones and Kim Newman.  The limited edition also includes a booklet with new writing on the film, four lobby card reproductions, double-sided foldout poster and a collection of trailers.  The previous BU extras are not carried over, so you might want to hang onto it for the Karl Malden and James Franciscus radio interviews.  Otherwise, Arrow's version provides a much cleaner transfer and extras that elevate it on the collectability factor.",1514332800,,3754,5.225
