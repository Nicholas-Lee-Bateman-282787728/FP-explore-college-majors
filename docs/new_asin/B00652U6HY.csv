4959605,5,B00652U6HY,"this movie has everything an animal lover would love.  Small kids can enjoy an adventure while watching an animal hero save the day and win his rewards. The only ""bad"" scene is where the bad guy kicks Tiffany but they don't show it either.  Too bad this style isn't adopted over the more graphic films for kids.  The kids show good manners and more or less everyone models good behavior. All in all a great family film. Bonus on the other movies, i didn't watch them but the kids seem to like them. win-win for everyone.",1382745600,,520,4.395833333333333

I would highly recommend this movie for children.  Not an action filled plot by today's
standards but very well done and kid friendly. And Benji does get the girl in the end.",1355529600,6,261,4.3061224489795915
