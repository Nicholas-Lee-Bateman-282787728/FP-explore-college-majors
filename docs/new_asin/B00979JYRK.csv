Like so many kdramas it went downhill the last 1/3 of the show. Maybe the director got tired.",1528070400,,266,4.448979591836735

A mild spoiler alert - While ""Antique Bakery"" doesn't strictly fall under the yaoi category of anime, the main characters have what is known in the current ventricular of pop culture as sexual fluidity So if you find this offensive, please fell free to skip this review.
Still haunted by nightmares from the time when he was kidnapped and held for months as a young boy, Keiichiro Tachibana, a highly successful businessman, decides to resign from his current job in the family business, with the blessings of both his parents, to open up a bakery shop that specializes in French desert pastry.
Keiichiro finds an old anitque shop which he begins to convert into an upscale bakery. Since he knows absolutely nothing about baking, his parents hire the best French ptissier in Japan, who just happens to be Yusuke Ono - a former high school classmate of Keiichiro's who just happened to be in love with him and who Keiichiro violently rejected when Yusuke declared his love for him.
Initially, while Keiichiro feels unease over Yusuke reappearance in his life because of his past cruelty, Yusuke reassures Keiichiro that he is long over him.
Yusuke is also a bit of Don Juan, able to sleep with any gay or straight man he wants - but pursues a relationship with Chikage Kobayakawa - Keiichiro's klutzy boyhood friend and self-proclaimed body guard.
Chikage does have a daughter with Sakurako Sakaki - a best selling novelist in Japan; but is in love with Yuskue.
Former boxer Eiji Kanda rounds out the quartet as Yuskue's appreentice. It's hinted that while Eihi is primarily straight, he is willing to sleep with men.
Against the backdrop of Antique Bakery, the four men learn to work as a team and slowly become a family as Keiichiro tries to unravel the mystery behind his kidnapping and why the man who kidnapped him fed him only cake - something he rarely eats nowadays.
Very compelling storyline that employs a very minimalistic animation style at times.
Compelling!
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1496275200,5,2098,4.929378531073446
