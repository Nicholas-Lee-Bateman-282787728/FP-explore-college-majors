6432857,3,B00KIZY8IW,"According to a neighbor, this ""historical"" drama takes quite a few liberties with the real facts. Talk about lacking a sense of fun. Well, what would you expect from a piece of Hollywood Technicolor pageantry directed by Arthur Lubin, of all people, the gentleman responsible for all those Francis, the talking mule opuses. So right away you know this ain't gonna be a Robert Bolt-David Lean ""intelligent"" epic.

Maureen O'Hara, who was created for Technicolor, plays the lady of the title and her ride in the nude is beautifully and ""tastefully"" presented, this movie, was after all, produced in the uptight 50's. George Nader, as handsome and stiff as ever, looks quite uncomfortable in his equally stiff medieval wig that has more work on it than his leading lady's hairdo. There is no point in going into the skimpy plot since the whole thing is nothing more than a protracted and wholesome tease until the famous ride on the white stallion. Throughout the entire film the director simply nails the camera to the floor while the gabby scenes unfold. I found myself dozing a couple of times, but I've sat through a lot worse.

Recommended only for diehard fans of the gorgeous O'Hara and the old and breathtaking Technicolor. Fans of Mr. Nader should be warned that no beefcake is in view.  The film is OK for family fair as there is nothing offensive nor the slightest bit salacious. Others might even find it campy fun. Not a lavish production, but at the very least a respectable one.",1405036800,16,1490,4.767441860465116

I enjoyed this very much. Hope Universal releases more gems like this from their vaults. Ones I'd really like to have are, Four Guns To The Border, Six Bridges To Cross, The Second Greatest Sex, Congo Crossing, Four Girls In Town, Man Afraid, Joe Butterfly, Appointment With A Shadow, and Flood Tide.
