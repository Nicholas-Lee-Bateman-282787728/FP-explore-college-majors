7848717,4,6303439357,"One of the better Disney Sing Along Songs videos, this video has a nice romantic atmosphere. It also has a nice change of routine. On previous videos, the main song was seen at the beginning, but here it is saved for the big finale- the right choice. That big finale is the amazing song ""Colors Of The Wind"" performed by the breathtaking singing voice of Pocahontas (Broadway star Judy Kuhn). The other Pocahontas song is ""Just Around The Riverbend"". Complimenting the video are ""Why Should I Worry?"" (Oliver & Company), ""Higitus Figitus"" (The Sword In The Stone) and the Cinderella work song (previously seen on an earlier Sing Along Songs video).

A Secret highlight is the new Disney chorus versions of ""Little Wooden Head"" from Pinocchio and the brilliant ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" from The Lion King. These are not the original versions from the films, but alternative ones, and I hope you'll agree that they are so much better.",1123718400,7,939,4.796296296296297
