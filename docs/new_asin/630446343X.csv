879931,5,630446343X,"i am so thrilled they are releasing the cartoons of the 80's.  the cartoons of today are just depressing and awful.  i actually use these for sat. morn cartoons. i am including the episode list so that you can see if you already have them on previously released dvds.

the 4episodes on the dvd are

dance, jade, dance

spread your wings

time& again

statues

& bonus episode the shy's the limit - this is the one that tells of the origins of the characters. why it was not on vol 1 is really odd, but at least they finally got around to putting it on.",1150934400,7,552,4.190476190476191

7871615,2,630446343X,"I love the Sky Dancers and I'm in high school, but this product is not a good one. It has lonely heart and a friend in a high place. I like the episode lonely heart but the second one not so much. The second one is entirely clips from previous episodes and is hard to follow. You be better off buying volume 1, flights of fancy,  which has lonely heart and just not get a friend in high places. I wish someone had told me this before I bought a show from my younger days. But parents this series is amazing for your kid and is intriguing don't let this one review hurt it for you.",1432598400,,580,4.0
