1916534,5,B0000CABIF,"This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I've never even heard of World Race before, except for one commercial. Then, I got the movie and it was great! The CGI animation really rocks and the cars are tubular! I recommend this movie to anyone!",1072137600,,252,4.382978723404255
1916535,5,B0000CABIF,"This movie is great! Its all five episodes on one disc without any noticeable commercial break spots (such as when Vert is approaching the lava flow on the Episode 1 disc). The World Race is more than a race to see who's the fastest driver in the world. It is also a place that reflects life. Team Building, betrayal, and redemption all occur on Highway 35. The action never lets up and actually intensifies in the later episodes when a double-blind is pulled on one of the drivers, a new menace is presented, and the World Race turns into one big, fast free-for-all that culminates in a battle at the mecca for racers.
The DVD contains all 5 team videos, a video for Smash Mouth's ""Hot"" and a section with all 35 cars w/vital statistics, along with a short driver biography. Kind of like the ones that come in the mini comics.
Believe me, this movie is about the race and the race only! With an interesting story, and someone who actually says Taro's line (""I'm going to pass you."") to the Scorcher's leader and does it. Its in a class all to itself, a World Class!",1070323200,4,1066,4.416243654822335
1916536,5,B0000CABIF,"My four year old has gone absolutely nuts over this series, having seen #1 and #2. We impatiently wait for the complete series installment, but I know that this one will get alot of mileage  (nyuck-nyuck) around here, sharing a rotation with Speed Racer in the vroom-vroom room......",1068163200,6,283,4.895833333333333

1916569,5,B0000CABIF,This is a different animation style than the Hotwheels Acceleration box set but it is a good addition.  My 2 children have no complaints and watch at least twice a week.,1407715200,,169,4.451612903225806

1916572,2,B0000CABIF,"All of the races include drivers crashing into one another and are very competitive trying to win the race.  There is a seen where two racers get into a physical fight and one kicks another and pushed one over a cliff.  There are also several explosions on the track.  I think this is a movie for at least 6 and older.  The racers are very mean to each other.  They are also trying to get the ""wheel of power"" and there are bad guys that will do anything to get it.  I am very disappointed that I got this for my 4 year old.  Beware not for preschoolers.",1397347200,,554,4.074074074074074

1916574,5,B0000CABIF,"My 5 year old son loves this DVD. Great value too. There are very few hot wheels animated shows, so this is a good one. The length is perfect, keeps his attention. It's perfect if your child loves playing with hot wheels.",1396137600,2,221,4.285714285714286
1916575,4,B0000CABIF,This movie reminds me of when I was a kid. I watched this movie a lot when I was a kid and it is still a great movie.

The story is almost 2 hours long.  They are going to race on HWY 35. The winner will get 5 million $! They are seperated into teams.  Their goal is to aquire the 'Wheel of Power'.  Well, of course there is someone else who wants the wheel. The baddie hires a driver to get the wheel.

1916602,5,B0000CABIF,"I absolutely despise this movie.  However, my son loves it and that's who I bought it for so it gets 5 stars.  Actually, ""loves"" isn't the word.  ""Obsessed"" is more like it.  It keeps him busy.",1336521600,,193,4.277777777777778

1916606,5,B0000CABIF,"Ever since my two year old son found this hotwheels animation movie in the shelf of a rental store, he just fell in love with it. I thought it would be best to buy one instead of renting it over and over. I asked the sales associate if they will sell me a copy of this movie but they have to ask the corporate office. So I waited but never heard from them. So I start shopping around, check online, and compare prices. I thought I got lucky to find a second-hand at $4.99 only to find out that it was just the first episode. It was too short it disappoint my son's expectation knowing the fact that he have seen the movie so many times. Now I'm concerned about the price, shipping and the quality of the product. I know it's hard luck to find what I'm looking for considering the age of the movie, but I was thrilled to find the hotwheels highway 35 world race full-length movie all brand new here at amazon for a reasonable price. I didn't think twice I bought it and that look at my son's face when I handed him the movie he love so much...is priceless. Now my son can watched it endlessly while holding his toy cars and sometimes he just fell asleep in the couch while the movie is on. I am definitely happy with my purchase. I give away the first hotwheels movie I bought to my son's friend as birthday gift. The mom told me her son love the movie as well and that she's thinking of buying one -- so I told her what I did and recommend to look at amazon.",1285891200,,1458,4.101398601398602

1916619,5,B0000CABIF,"My son loves his Hot Wheels Stunt Track Challenge PC game. He's been collecting Hot Wheels cars. Then we discovered Hot Wheels Dot Com. We have found these resources to be exciting, age appropriate, and very well done. Then we rented an Acceleracers DVD. My son was blown away by the story and, of course, all the action. My wife and I were surprised to find the plot intriguing. Since then we bought all of the Acceleracers DVDs. They are great family fun and, in particular, our 6 year old son LOVES them.

1916624,5,B0000CABIF,"The dialog is inane but the sound and visuals are pretty cool. If your over four this DVD will make you want to jump out the window. However, my son loves it and will watch it over and over. The positive side is that it encourges building Hot Wheels track. Great entertainment for a little kid and it also has a positive message about responsibility and looking out for one another.",1212278400,,382,4.394366197183099
1916625,5,B0000CABIF,"Our son LOVES Hot Wheels.  We rented the World Race movie for him when he was 3.  We all watched it.  At first I was concerned about the message it might be sending (I think someone else refered to Vert as a spoiled military brat), but afterwards, I was very pleased.  I also liked the 'safety' aspects of the movie (always buckle up, wear a helmet, and the importance of working as a team, etc.).
We couldn't wait until the other movies made it to the shelves.  We immediately decided that it was a movie we were going to have to buy or constantly be renting it.
The Acceleracer movies (1-4 + the World Race for a total of 5 movies), although good, are not as good as the first one, especially for the audience age range that will be seeing it.  I don't like the change in the presentation.  It's too dark (scenes and characters).  Some of the voices changed as well.  The 1st Acceleracer movie has a character who's brother died in a race.  They never really go into it far enough for a young child to understand and it didn't need to be in there.  Plus, you also have the dark almost evil side of Mark Wilde.  It is over the top compared to his character in the World Race.  The only saving grace about the Acceleracer movies was that our son was older by the time they came out.  So, I could help explain the problems to him better.
All that said, all the movies are good.  The World Race is, by far, the best.  Our son is 7 1/2 now and STILL asks to watch it.

UPDATE 06/2009:  Our son STILL watches this movie when he can!  And, this is still his favorite from the series.  Well worth the investment.

UPDATE 07/2011:  Our son now 10 STILL loves these movies and is now passing that love onto our 3yo son too!",1212192000,,1715,4.196319018404908
1916626,5,B0000CABIF,"I really liked this title. I original watch it on cartoonnetwork but some of the movies. Being impressed, i dicided to buy all of them. World race is the first title and Acceleracers is the next four title. The fact that it was made by the company MainFrame(R)(made Reboot, ActionMan, Max Steel,Spiderman 3d seires etc.) also made it worth wild, if your a fan of there work i advise you or anyone to look into these dvds. the movies are also great for kids/family who are hotwheels fans or not. the movies are also up-to-date as far as fast/street car movies(specs) and this thrill ride gives kids or any a good moral to live by the end of each movie.(especially for kids). bottom line, i would recomend: Hot Wheels Accelaracers and Hot wheels world race.",1205798400,,755,4.6
1916627,5,B0000CABIF,"I ordered this movie to play at my son's ""Hot Wheels"" birthday party. He, and the rest of the 7 yr. olds, thought it was awesome!

We had rented it, and I've been looking in stores for it, thanks to Amazon we now own it. We watch it over and over. It's an action packed movie with really cool cars! We also have the box set of Hot Wheels Acceleracers. This one is a bit cruder. The characters are bit more violent in these. Use caution if you try the set. The music is awesome!",1179619200,,480,4.117021276595745
1916637,5,B0000CABIF,My son loves these Hot Wheels movies -- he's 7.  I think this first one started off with a good story and has plenty of action.

1916667,3,B0000CABIF,"I bought this for my three-year-old, after the other reviews said it was great for all ages.  The plot was a little much for him to follow, but he did like watching the cars go for a while.  I'd say his interest waned before half the movie was over.

The animation is okay.  It's all computer generated, if you like that kind of stuff.

Just as a mom, I thought one of the lines was hilarious:  The main character meets a more ""seasoned"" driver, a guy with a reputation for being ""cool"" and ""radical"", and the main character notes that he ""heard"" that the dude had ""skied down Mount Everest.""  I had to laugh at that.",1136937600,,617,4.267241379310345

WTG Hot wheels for creating this series.  This is where accelracers begins!  When compared to Accelracers ignition, I do like the characters better in this movie.  It is lighter, and the characters look more ""normal"".  This movie just rocks for the boys in your life.  The characters are boys and act like boys LMAO!

1916671,5,B0000CABIF,"I bought this DVD because my 3 year old son (of course) loves the toy cars and he needed a video besides the Blue's Clue's and Dora types.  I bought this particular video based on a review I read saying there wasn't any real violence and it taught teamwork skills.  In my opinion the makers of the film did a fair job with the no violence though there was one man on man fight where one kicked the other and one pushed the other down a hill.  Also, there was a part where a robot was obviously trying to hurt a human with a large chunk of ice.  My son makes me put my hand around his face at that part but still wants to watch. Otherwise, honestly, I really enjoy the movie myself!  As I put in the video for the first time my husband and I both got stuck there in front of the TV watching it too.  It catches your attention right away!  I did think it got long after the first two hours though and found myself waiting to get to the end.  I have still watched it a few times since though.

They don't even speak English but they enjoyed every minute of the movie. I guess in their case it's a good way for them to learn English. He was curious about the meaning of words and he would repeat them and ask me for their meanings. At first I thought it was a disadvantage that the movie didn't come with a Spanish language option, but then I realized my sons didn't need them.

1916684,5,B0000CABIF,"""Vert"" Wheeler is an average young adult, an expert surfer and skateborder who has just gotten his driving license (with a perfect score, no less!).

When he returns how he finds a mysterious car (the Deora) in his driveway. The enigmatic Dr. Tezla, manufacturer of the finest racing vehicles in the world, recruits him, along with more of the world's greatest drivers, to compete in the World Race!

The drivers will race down the mysterious Highway 35, an super-track built by an ancient race called the Accelerons. What lies at the end of this race is what Dr. Tezla craves: The Wheel of Power, a source of limitless, clean energy.

Five racing teams with 35 total drivers and 35 vehicles compete for mastery of Highway 35, the ultimate raceway that challenges man and machine in an alternate dimension of speed, power and performance.

This movie delivers 110 minutes of fun entertainment, with plenty of thrilling moments as well as a positive moral message here and there (that's not delivered too heavy-handed). The movie, while filled with action and adventure, includes virtually no physical violence. It's a great video for children (assuming they like cars!).

Artisan did a good job with this DVD. The movie is offered in both full screen and widescreen versions, each sporting a 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. Bonus features are an interactive garage that provides details on the 35 racers and vehicles, as well as six fun music videos. The interactive garage features three ""hidden"" easter eggs, with character/car information for Gelorum, Dr Tezla & Gig, and Zed-36.

The adventures of many of these characters is continued in the Hot Wheels Acceleracers series, although with some mixed results.

It has thrills, plot, morality, very little violence, and no swear words.  Of course I'd rather watch an adult-themed movie, but when my son picks a G rated movie from our library, I always enjoy it.  My older son (age 11) also thinks this is a great movie.

BTW, after watching the movie, I had to see what amazon.com users had to say about it.  You have not disappointed me.  This is a great movie!",1109980800,,567,4.146788990825688
1916688,5,B0000CABIF,"When my 4 year old son first got this movie, I dreaded it.  It just seemed so annoying to me.  Then, I actually sat down and watched it with him and I have to admit that this is a really good movie.  My son watches this over and over and over again.  I have memorized most of the dialogue from the movie and now every wheel we see is ""The Wheel of Power"".  Definitely well worth the money.",1105833600,3,389,3.9358974358974357
1916689,5,B0000CABIF,"Although I have exhausted my enjoyment with this movie, my 4 year old son loves Hot Wheels and watches this DVD over and over and over... There are some pretty cool stunts in this, and when we're in the car, I hear him saying lines from the movie and talking about all the characters (like role-playing).  It's one of the best DVD's out there for little Hot Wheel loving boys.  It is a little long, but who with kids ever watches an entire movie all the way through anyway??",1104192000,3,474,4.314606741573034
1916690,5,B0000CABIF,"My 3 1/2 year-old son is a Hot Wheels fanatic ... he's got about 200 cars. He bought this DVD 6 months and absolutely loves it. He listens to the song ""Hot"" over and over again and talks about the characters at school. When he plays with his Highway 35 cars (we got them from Ebay) he voices the dialogues that go with the cars. The movie has some great themes of friendship, teamwork and losing gracefully. The special effects are great and the characters are quite likable. The only drawback, for adults, is that the movie is pretty long and can seem repetitive. I've only watched once all the way through.",1102982400,5,608,4.4375
1916691,5,B0000CABIF,"We were pleasantly surprised by this movie.  My 20 mo. old son LOVES this movie and wants to watch it over and over.  My husband loves it just as much, saying the story, music, and especially the animation and characters are awesome.  Highly recommend, espcially for those car lovers!",1101340800,,284,4.755102040816326
1916692,5,B0000CABIF,"My son really enjoys Hot Wheels cars, and his enthusiasm really carries over to the movie.  Out of all the DVDs that we have, this is the only title that he asks to watch again and again and again.  He even sings the intro song, and knows some of the dialog.  I looked today on Amazon.com to see if there was a sequel to purchase for him for Christmas.",1100736000,,352,4.072463768115942
1916693,5,B0000CABIF,"I got this for my 9 year old son and really enjoyed watching it with him.  He watches it over and over.  One of the cool things about the DVD is that you can get information on each driver , study their individual cars, etc.  The music is great and the action is unstoppable!

It was a good movie with several good themes...including a driver gone bad who makes a turn around for good; an exciting rescue scene even when the rescue meant a possibility of losing the race; and the importance of team work.

I as a parent liked it and my child did as well.  A good combination.",1092441600,2,575,4.181818181818182

It is though a good movie, tied in with the racing are lessons about teamwork, friendship and loyalty. The animation on it is great, the dialoge is clean and kid-friendly and dude, it's hotwheels. II think I may be losing my mind though because I am starting to talk along with the movie.",1083974400,27,452,4.567901234567901

This movie was for me, a godsend.  The PS2 game is also blessed by me.  for any little boy who truly LOVES his hot wheels, I would suggest purchasing these.",1081296000,2,310,3.857142857142857
1916696,5,B0000CABIF,"My 3 year old son can't get enough of this movie. The first thing he wants to do every morning is to watch ""his"" movie. He has watched it so much that he knows the whole movie word for word. He uses his own hot wheel cars and pretends that they are in the race. It is definitely a family movie. Fortunately my husband, myself, and my teenage daughter all enjoy it too, since my son wants to watch it so much. It is much better than some of the shows on t.v. It has real good morals which is very important to us.",1080777600,,512,3.9326923076923075

Both my boys are into cars just like their dad and I that they totally love this movie. It's not as violent as Fast &amp; Furious Movies, but there are enough action that shows how great these cars are and what they can do. My boys couldn't stop watching this great movie, they watch it over and over and over again almost everyday.

1916699,5,B0000CABIF,"I have two boys (2 & 4 yo). All they ever want to do is play with Hotwheels Cars. The always get tons of cool stuff at Christmas but Hotwheels are their favorite. I rented this movie and they've watched it at least 6 times a day for the last 3 days on their own TV. It's the most peaceful time we've had in the last 4 years :-) That's why I'm looking on Amazon now to buy a copy. I don't know what's going to happen next Sunday when we have to return the movie to Blockbuster.
OK, most adults would probably think it was a terrible movie... but it's not for adults... it's for kids! Any kid who has a box full of Hotwheels cars will recognize the vehicles and tracks. And unlike most kids movies, it actually has some sort of story.",1076284800,3,732,4.055172413793104
1916700,5,B0000CABIF,"My 8yo son and I watched HOT WHEELS: WORLD RACE and it is a true non-stop action extravaganza! A 16yo kid enters the world race with other fellow speed freaks. They roar all the way through, entering and exiting various dimensions through a vortex that opens whenever they hit 300mph. The race is fast and definitely furious, with lots of explosions tossed in. My son jumped all over the room watching this! Highly recommended for kids and their developmentally maladjusted parents (like me)...",1074643200,4,494,4.963855421686747
