5313199,1,B009B8YZOO,"It was filmed were I live. Thats great, but the movie was not great! It was  not scary even though it was a horror movie. I thought it could of been better. And it ended so bad that i felt like screaming.",1371340800,2,204,3.857142857142857
5313200,4,B009B8YZOO,The movie is slow I will agree to that .. but I personally liked it. And the twist ending is quite rewarding. It has quite a few creepy moments that might make you jump out of your seat. If you don't mind waiting for a revealing finish I highly recommend watching.,1368662400,3,264,4.196078431372549
5313201,2,B009B8YZOO,"A serious mess of a movie, with two of the dumbest people ever put on film. They don't have enough brains to simply follow their snowmobile trail out of the forest back to the truck. With riveting scenes like her gathering wood, and fascinating cinematic imagery of her eating a granola bar, it's a wonder this didn't clean up at all the award ceremonies. She is a complete nag, and he was a total tool. Add to the mix a completely bland and do-nothing foe, there's nothing to do except hope the end comes quickly. No such luck. Total bomb here. I didn't even watch to the end, and only got as far as I did because let's face it, she is one gorgeous woman.",1365120000,10,656,4.256
5313202,1,B009B8YZOO,Very slow not too much to keep your attention . The end was crazy but other than that very boring .,1364947200,2,99,3.761904761904762
5313203,3,B009B8YZOO,"I thought is started off very well, but was a strange movie.
Seen it once, do not want to see it again.
Sorry I purchased it",1362528000,,124,3.8076923076923075
5313204,4,B009B8YZOO,A fair movie not to bad acting. Emma (Brit Morgan) and Mike (Seth David Mitchell) take a winter camping trip that turns hellish after they survive a snowmobile accident and are then stranded in the ice-cold wilderness. Emma's blood runs even colder after Mike vanishes and she is pursued by a mysterious stalker. Gripping indie thriller boasts vivid Colorado locations co-stars Noah Segan. Worth the time to watch.,1359331200,5,414,5.102941176470588
5313205,3,B009B8YZOO,"Randomly viewed this movie last night.
It is fairly interesting, but still on the lines of ""been there, done that.""
Brit Morgan does a great job with her role.  I felt her boyfriend's acting was terrible.  They displayed two different acting styles, which produced a feeling of imbalance & ultimately distraction.
The film will most likely hold your interest because you'll be wondering just what the heck is going on.
Eh, it gives you something to think about.",1358380800,3,461,4.897435897435898
5313206,5,B009B8YZOO,i just love this movie it has every thing in it that you like in a movie if you like scary movies you will love this movie,1357603200,2,122,3.5555555555555554
5313207,3,B009B8YZOO,"The newly pregnant, former bar tender Emma (Brit Morgan) is going on a snow camping trip with her uninformed boyfriend Mike (Seth David Mitchell). They travel 9-10 miles from the road in a snowmobile to a spot recommended by Cowboy Jeff. After the snowmobile takes a spill, the couple struggles to survive. Emma suffers from vivid dreams and hallucinations.

The film drops clues as to what is going on. It leads you in one direction and then another. Brit Morgan did a good job as a woman who is pregnant in an unsure relationship. There are things that don't make sense as you watch it, that come together at the end which was a bit anti-climatic. They could have given us some more scenery too. Brit Morgan did a good job. Seth David Mitchell and Noah Segan acted like they wanted different careers. Their parts were written as support for the main character.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1356825600,5,908,4.66875
5313208,4,B009B8YZOO,"The cold locations in Colorado, along with the acting skills, make this a pretty good, taut story that will keep you in suspense although I think you'll figure out soon enough what is really going on.",1356048000,5,200,4.583333333333333
5313239,2,B009B8YZOO,Did not care for this movie.,1429228800,,28,3.8333333333333335
5313240,3,B009B8YZOO,Excellent delivery service. I could not believe the twist to the story at the end of the movie.  I was an enjoyable movie,1424563200,,121,4.260869565217392
5313241,1,B009B8YZOO,"Wholly unperceivable from any other low budget ""lost in the woods with a terrifying presence"" genre entry we are forced through character exposition, cliched dialogue so trite and delivered with monotone emotion a chain of events so predictable you can't help but wonder if you've seen this movie before, even when you know you haven't, this is 94 insufferable minutes ( most of which are long, drawn out scenes of dialogue and extended shots of the woods to fill the bulk of the run time). The acting, drab cinematography, tired attempts at horror are all so conventional we sigh in defeat and from tedium than feeling anything near the fear the filmmakers intend. It wants to be a slow burn thriller but the molasses-like pace doesn't build any suspense, evoke any dimension to the antagonists and instead makes this pointless film a torturous exercise in patience that doesn't even deliver a satisfying reward in the end for our concentrated efforts. This is instantly forgettable and will only leave the audience frustrated for wasting their time.",1419033600,2,1051,5.011428571428572
5313242,4,B009B8YZOO,"I was totally surprised at the ending. I'd recommend it!
The storyline moves slowly. Once it picks up, though, it was intense! I'm not much on horror, but this one is great! Something along the lines of Taken in that it is a bit intense in a scene or two, but for a ""B"" movie, it does really well!

As a survivalist myself, this sucks. A snowmobile accident handled incredibly badly by Emma and Matt turns out to be a pretty good story. The outdoorswoman in me is screaming about their idiocy on management of a trauma situation... but, yeah, it's good.",1410307200,,553,4.421568627450981
5313243,1,B009B8YZOO,"Amazon, I can't rate this movie.  There was no sound although we tried several different times.  No problem with any other movies.  Just this one.",1402790400,,146,4.76

5313245,5,B009B8YZOO,"This film is very entertaining, suspenseful and has a refreshingly interesting twist. I loved it and thought it was well done.",1394668800,,126,5.0476190476190474
5313246,1,B009B8YZOO,"OMG... stupid, stupid, stupid.  Contrived, played out and predictable.  Pretty much in any psychological thriller or horror movies these days, if there are dream sequences or odd disappearing people or hallucinations, bet your ass the lead character is either dead or in some sort of coma / medically induced trance for treatment.  So the lead characters in this load are dead and you pretty much figure this out right after the snowmobile crashed.  I just saved you an hour and a half of time that you may have spent on this uninteresting garbage.  But hey, if you like the 100 other movies out there where the lead characters end up being ghosts but don't realize it, you might as well watch movie 101 with that same plot device.",1386201600,2,731,4.6796875
5313247,3,B009B8YZOO,"Emma, newly pregnant, goes on a snowmobiling weekend with her boyfriend Mike - out in the middle of BFE. Neither are experienced campers nor experienced on a snowmobile but oh well. Let's try this out for fun anyway.

Freezing cold, beautiful Colorado country (that could have been shown more), strangely appearing and disappearing people, a general atmosphere of woo woo - all tied together in a fairly decent movie that drags in the middle and ends pretty predictably.

Oh, and I am partially deaf and there were no subtitles on the movie. For shame!",1377129600,,552,4.861702127659575
5313248,1,B009B8YZOO,"--bland characters
--sluggish pace that will make your eyelids droop
--psychological horror that lacks gore but also lacks suspense
--shaky cam
--swaying cam (where the cam isn't steady but isn't shaking either)
--a carcass that has flies buzzing around it in winter
--annoying jump scares where the sound goes BOOM! so loud it causes you to rip your headphones off your ears
--main villain is a just some Seth Green-looking hillbilly
--the ""twist ending"" has been so overused that it isn't a twist because, if you're a horror fan, you've seen the ending dozens of times before

This movie will get you to sleep faster than listening to an audio CD of Ben Stein reading the Webster's Dictionary.",1372118400,,695,4.889830508474576

8539321,3,B009B8YZOO,"This move is not great, but it is not awful either. I appreciate the message at the end but it took a long way to get there. Plus, they showed us nothing to indicate that these people were Christians. The gf was pretty hateful for parts of the movie. But that being said, the acting was good, the scenery was nice. I am also not sure about the plotline but that is a horror/thriller for you, even if it tries to be a good Christian message. Also. for the majority of the movie I did not know what was going on and did not guess the ending so it has that going for it.",1496880000,,567,3.982456140350877

8539323,2,B009B8YZOO,"As others have stated, this is a verrryyy slow moving movie. I almost turned it off a few times, and in fact came on Amazon to read the reviews while watching it. BIG mistake - as some jackass had told the ending in his review without a 'spoiler alert'. The ending is good, and a twist I wouldn't have expected had I not read the jackass' spoiler first. Worth a viewing on a boring day, but not great, even for a B.",1456272000,,415,4.073170731707317

8539326,2,B009B8YZOO,"One almost sure way to tell you're watching a low-budget and usually bad horror film is when you have a maudlin and overly dramatic musical score, especially when it comes during the opening credits.  One point against The Frozen (not to be confused with 2010s Frozen).  Emma and her boyfriend Mike are on a winter camping trip into a remote mountainous area when their snowmobile crashes and becomes inoperable.  They walk back to their tend to try and figure out their next move.  Do they try to walk back to their truck or try to fix the snowmobile?

Well our intrepid little couple chooses a third option which is basically to do nothing but wander around their camp and bitch at each other.  In the meantime they spot a mysterious man staring at them who disappears when they try to approach him for help.  Brit Morgan as Emma does a credible job as the stressed girlfriend who is keeping her pregnancy secret from Mike.  You may remember Morgan from a recurring role in HBOs True Blood.

When Mike disappears Emma begins seeing other strange, ghoulish people and having terrifying dreams.  Now I hate playing spoiler but The Frozen is little more than a remake of Carnival of Souls with nary a hint of that cult classics atmosphere.  Very few will likely be surprised by the twist ending.  Theres a fine line between building suspense in a film and just moving along too slowly and Director Andrew Hyatt in his debut at the helm hasn't quite figured out the difference yet.

There are some good scenes at the beginning and end but the middle is filled with a lot of dull padding and you have to struggle to keep up your interest.",1438387200,2,1635,4.577319587628866
