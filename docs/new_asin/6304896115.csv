7879384,5,6304896115,"Bought this a few years ago after borrowing it from my local library. Wore out my VHS tape finally and purchased a DVD which
gets plenty of use. I really feel good after using this.",1414108800,,181,4.2
7879385,4,6304896115,"i bought this tape for one cent from amazon marketplace dealer

and its a bargain.

i am an overweight 61 year old who has been exercising for almost two year(alas no weight loss)this tape runs 48 min of active exercise and i used 3 pound weights.  i thoought it was

good. perhaps the instructor could have paused after some reps

but she does say you can pause when you want.

i wouldn't pay $25 for a new tape but if you find used buy it.

and i would recommend to anyone looking for a introduction to

free weights, not only ""old people""",1144195200,4,541,4.235294117647059
7879386,4,6304896115,"I still work full time and am fairly active. I use my treadmill a few times a week (hate it)  but felt I was not generally as fit as I need to be as older age approaches. This is not a difficult workout for a person of average physical ability. It includes a stretching routine and then a workout with light weights. It seems to include most muscle groups and targets those areas older folks need to keep active. If you are a body builder this is not for you, it will be too easy. As a routine to continue as we get older it's great.",1105574400,5,533,4.028301886792453
7879387,5,6304896115,"I'm 67 years old and have been working out to the Geri-Fit videotape for 5 months. I do this three times a week, almost without fail and I follow the entire session, not skipping the stretching before or after.
On that basis, let me say that I'm enjoying tremendous benefits from this regimen. Those benefits include increased mobility, flexibility, strength, and balance.  I thought perhaps I had passed the age where I could recover what was lost, but this workout has proved me wrong.  I can walk up the two flights of stairs in my townhouse without pulling myself along using the handrails; I can scrub the kitchen floor on my hands and knees; all my strength for opening jars is back; I can rise from a chair without leveraging myself up by hands on knees; and can do calf exercises on a rocker board without holding on to the doorjambs.  The list goes on and on.  I can't recommend this video more highly to mature adults who think they've passed the point of no return.",1004054400,35,976,4.528409090909091
7879388,5,6304896115,"I received this VIDEO last week and am very pleased with it.  For a change, this exercise is for the over 50 in mind and the people involved do not have hour-glass figures.  In other words, they are the average  ""Senior Citizens"" who take responsibility for their fitness.",919123200,43,272,4.625
