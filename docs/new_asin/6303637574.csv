It is funny, a true comedy while it also  allows you to feel other feelings, like loneliness. This movie I recommend  wholeheartedly.",911520000,,312,4.553571428571429

698320,2,6303637574,"but this movie was mostly stupid.  As for laughs, yes there were some.  The movie is ""cute"" as my wife calls it.  In this case, cute gets 2.5 stars.

Spoiler alert:

Bullock's character had so many chances to set things right and waits until she's about to get married to a man she doesn't love to spill the truth.  And Pullman's character falling in love with his brother's imagined fiance while his brother was in a coma is a strange movie choice for a comedy.  Hard to root for the guy.  I guess they deserve each other.  And there were some silly errors in the movie.  For instance, in one scene Pullman is driving Bullock to a party not too far from her apartment.  In front of her apartment there is snow and ice.  When Pullman pulls up in front of the house where the party is taking place, the entire area looks completely without snow.  It was like they drove from Chicago to Southern California in a matter of seconds.",1516320000,,928,4.356725146198831
698321,5,6303637574,"My favorite Sandra Bullock movie. Dvd worked, all was well.",1516060800,,59,5.0
698322,5,6303637574,"What I like most about this movie is the chemistry between Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock. This is a movie set around Christmas time featuring a young woman who has lost her father, lives alone with her cat and is working at a Amtrak train station. She seems to be stuck in one place, bored and lonely when she sees a very handsome man go through her line every day. She fantasizes in her mind and dreams about a life with him. He has no idea she even exists until Christmas day when he finally speaks to her then proceeds to fall off of the side of a rail after being robbed. She saves him, gets him to the hospital where he falls into a coma. A great misunderstanding erupts that causes high jinx and silliness and just a lot of funny scenes. The family opens their arms to her and she loves that and comes to love them. However after meeting the brother of the man in the coma from the train station, she begins a relationship with him that leads to both of them falling for each other but unable to move forward due to the belief that she belongs to his brother. What follow is a sweet and funny journey for both of them that eventually leads to the truth at just the right moment. This story has a few twists and turns but never fails to entertain. The language is mild, some situational scenes but mostly very clean. The movie ends well. A very sweet movie that I think females will like. Not a children's movie. Enjoy!!!",1515801600,,1428,4.273062730627307

698546,5,6303637574,"This is one of those movies that can be watched over and again. First time you anticipate what is going to happen. Second time you see where they are setting you up. After a while you can imagine the seen from the sound. Back to the movie.
There is a nice story line and it is just in the believable. However it is the many small scenes that make you relay enjoy watching. When Lucy (Sandra Bullock) is confronted in Peter's apartment, Jack his brother is already suspicious of her. Peter's real girlfriend Ashley left her cat there. Lucy says she is just there to feed the cat, Jack smugly says that Peter has no cat. About that time what should come around the corner but the cat. Every time Jack thinks he has the upper hand, Lucy has a plausible explanation. I do not want to say too much, as it is fun to watch for the first time. However I think you will be able to relate the scene where the family is talking in the church.",1510185600,2,931,4.206703910614525

698679,1,6303637574,"This review is about the DVD, NOT the movie. This is listed as a wide screen movie version, but it only ever looked right on my old full screen TV. On a widescreen TV it looks awful, grainy resolution, picture too small, using zoom only makes it worse and unwatchable. I don't know if the Blu-ray version is better, I would hope so, but I liked this movie enough that I will replace it with a streaming version, even though I think the streaming versions are overpriced for what is now a 12 year old movie. I guess it's worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. If you liked this movie don't disappoint yourself with this DVD.",1504483200,,633,4.3277310924369745

It may be the movie I have watched over more times than any other on a regular basis and I have to really love a movie to want to watch it again. Bill Pullman is wonderful in this. Actually, everyone is. The casting is perfect. Whenever I make something that requires a lot of work in the kitchen or chopping, such as soup or chili, whatever, this is a movie I can watch and become absorbed in, but I can actually look away and it's okay, since I've seen it several dozen times or so, and be able to keep up with what is happening. The wedding proposal especially gets me every time. Of course there are places in the movie where I have to stop working away and just watch, every time, such as the ending I just spoke of. This is a movie that my husband can enjoy every bit as much as I. It's a movie you can actually sit down with the whole family and enjoy without worrying about any inappropriate parts.

***Spoiler Alert***

Lucy is in love with Peter, but secretly. He does not know that she even exists. She works as a token collector at the Train Station and she sees him every day, loving him in silence.

On Christmas Day, Peter is mugged and pushed onto the train tracks. Lucy jumps onto the tracks and saves him. She lies to the nurse that she is his fiance because she wants to know how he is doing. His eccentric family comes to the hospital and the nurse drops the bomb - Lucy is questioned by ALL of them but somehow, she manages to keep the lie intact.

Peter's Godfather, Saul is the only one who knows the truth. He asks her to play along for the sake of keeping the family happy. Peter's brother, Jack comes to town and Lucy falls head over heels in love with him. She is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. Which brother will she end up with???

Bullock and Pullman shared wonderful chemistry.  Bullock and the Pullman's family shared wonderful chemistry.  Bullock even shared wonderful chemistry with Joe Jr., the apartment super's son.

It makes me long for some magic and family bond during the holiday season.  Strangely, it never makes a life long single like me feeling depressed.  It does the opposite, lifting me out of gloom and into warm and fuzzy.",1445904000,7,625,4.885714285714286

She has a versatile face, which can be beautiful and even very homely, and her presence is always welcomed.  She lights up the screen.

Sandra Bullock/Lucy Eleanor Moderatz absolutely carries this film.  She is a toll both collector in love with handsome Peter Callaghan/Peter Gallagher, who comes through her line.  There is violence and a misunderstanding, and his family embraces her.  You understand why the entire family falls in love with her, including Peters brother.

The acting is so natural by most of the actors, especially the two lead characters, but also by some side characters, that it got to become believable, somehow real. And ""very likable"", to quote from the movie itself. It is sweet, funny, kind, refreshing, uplifting. It is not sleezy or cheap. You can watch it with toddlers playing around if must be, but please give this gem to yourself when you can really get into it. Even my husband likes it, which is rather rare when it comes to romantic comedies. Yes, I think this is one of the kindest movies I've ever watched. It makes my day and inspires me. The cast is amazingly well chosen. The movies doesn't bore me for a minute. There's no scene redundant, no scene short. Just perfect 'normal' life, like I wish for all of us to have it so. Can a movie be 'snug'? For that's the word that comes around to me.",1429574400,,952,4.294444444444444

This and Home Alone Lost In New York are movies that I absolutely must see every holiday season in order to properly get me in the holiday mood. This one, however, I can watch all year 'round. I absolutely adore Sandra Bullock's sweetness and Bill Pullman's humility, and how their relationship developed, without all the trashy lusty scenes that today's movies can't seem to get enough of showing. The love portrayed in special ways by all the family members, who all have such different personalities, is also a great reminder of how precious family is, and how important and POSSIBLE it is to have a loving family despite all of our quirky differences. It makes me appreciate mine all the more. I wish there were more movies like this one made today.",1418601600,13,808,4.6573426573426575

703631,5,6303637574,"I never get tired of watching this movie. Someone said it beats Sleepless in Seattle out of the water - and they're right. (Once for Sleepless was plenty for me).  Sandra Bullock plays Lucy (a lonely single woman with no family) who gets a crush on Peter. Through no fault of her own, Peter's family believes Lucy is engaged to Peter. Due to many ""occurrences"", the ""engagement"" is just reinforced to Peter's family (as he is in a coma) and Lucy can't figure out how to tell them she isn't engaged to Peter. In the meantime, she falls in love with Peter's family, and especially his brother, Jack (who's not too sure if she's really engaged to Peter), and Jack falls in love with Lucy.  What to do?!

704216,4,6303637574,"What?  You've never heard of the story of the woman who crushes on a man she sees every day during her job at a train station, saves his life after he's knocked unconscious and almost run over by a train, quietly professes to being his fiance (wishful thinking on her part), and is then stuck when the lie is accidentally overheard by the comatose man's family...all during the Christmas season?  Well, you've been missing out.  Miss out no longer.  Sandra Bullock plays the woman in this tale as she saves the life of a commuter, Peter Gallagher, who she happens to have a crush on.  A nurse overhears a private statement she makes about his crush and the man's entire family comes to believe she's their loved one's fiance...see, it's not nice to eavesdrop.  Stuck in the lie, the woman, Lucy Moderatz, joins the family for Christmas festivities and becomes close to them, including her ""fiance's"" younger brother, played by Bill Pullman.  High jinks ensue as the commuter, Peter Callaghan, comes to and does not remember Lucy...who could have seen that coming?  Without giving anything else away, it's a fun holiday film that spares us all those clichd morals.  I especially enjoyed Peter Boyle's performance.  Seeing the man who made the character of Frank Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond famous play this calm, quiet man just shows this great actor's range and talent.  He and the rest of the cast are definitely worth watching.  Enjoy.",1402444800,4,1445,4.853061224489796

704316,5,6303637574,"I always LOVED this film, which definitely isn't a ""chick flick"" but something you can see and enjoy together with your better half - and the magic of ""While you were sleeping"" works as well on one of the first dates, as near the silver wedding anniversary...

This is the story of a lonely shy girl named Lucy (Sandra Bullock) whose life is defined by a monotonous dead end job and a completely hopeless crush on a handsome wealthy man (Peter Gallegher) she meets every day, but who never looked at her, not even once... Then one day her whole world is overwhelmed by a kind of powerful (albeit non-lethal) tsunami - and she will be carried by this gentle but irresistible wave in a direction she would never have suspected... I will say no more here about the story.

The operative words when describing this film are ""warm"", ""gentle"" and ""adorable"". There is absolutely nothing dark in this whole film, even if at one moment a furious shrew (Ally Walker, grandiose) appears - but even she is somehow funny rather than bad... There is also a comatose patient, a freak incident involving a crayon, some furniture breaking (mostly accidental), pants ripping (completely accidental) and of course there is Joe Fusco Jr (Michael Rispoli, fantastic) whose very existence on this planet may seem to be an aggression against the rest of humanity - but all of this just gives the occasion for more humour.

Humour in this film is of best quality, with absolutely NO strong language, but with some pretty good one liners and verbal fencing. And then there is of course THE scene with the Callaghan family eating dinner together and having a conversation... Words can hardly describe this scene but I will always consider this as a great injustice that nobody was nominated to the Oscars for it...

This film, together with ""Speed"", was the beginning of Sandra Bullock's great career. Peter Boyle (greatly regretted) and Bill Pullman, who play respectively Ox Callaghan and Jack Callaghan (his second son), are two other pillars of this film.

Bottom line, this is an ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE thing, which can be watched as many times as you want (with my wife we saw it no less than seven times - may be more). A film to buy and see absolutely! Enjoy!",1400112000,,2239,4.730769230769231

704386,5,6303637574,"While You Were Sleeping has all the characteristics of a great romantic comedy, including some wacky memorable characters mixed in with the normal ones and a believable series of mix-ups.  The remarkable ease with which the actors and director Jon Turteltaub pull it off reminds me of Billy Wilder's Sabrina (which was likely an inspiration for the two brothers' odd relationship in While You Were Sleeping) or some other sophisticated black and white comedy.  Sandra Bullock is a very endearing actress to watch with a great smile and likable personality.  Even when she's overstretched emotionally by all the crazy goings-on in this story, there's a special charm to her exasperation.  Bill Pullman is very appealing as the romantic lead she falls in love with.  (While watching it, I often envisioned Kirk Douglas in the role because of some similarities of mannerisms.)

Romantic comedies take life seriously but with a lot of optimism.  I enjoy the genre because I love the clever writing and story developments.  This is one of my favorites.  Its humor is probably even cleaner than some black and white romantic comedies, and there's fairly little cussing.  My favorite three components are its 1) story developments, 2) 2 principal actors (Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman), and 3) other memorable characters.",1396828800,,1316,5.165094339622642

I loved it, it is just absolute perfection. And the crazy thing is, I can easily identify with Lucy (Sandra Bullock) character and could see myself very much in the same situation.

This movie was one of those that when it ended, you were sad, being as you didn't want it to end. Excellent chemistry all around with all the characters. And very few movies come along where it just makes absolute perfection.

704477,5,6303637574,"1995 was the year that Sandra Bullock challenged Meg Ryan for the title of America's Cinema Sweetheart.  ""The Net"" and this film particularly both released in 1995 were responsible.  My wife loves this movie, it's one of her all-time favorite romantic comedies and for me while not one of my top all-time favorites, I think it's one of the best of its genre in the 1990's.  ""While You Were Sleeping"" has a simplicity and a sweetness without being saccharine, a beguiling, charming cast headed by Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman giving breakthrough performances.

Lucy Moderatz (Sandra Bullock) is a young, lonely Chicago Transit Authority token collector.  An only child, her mother died when Lucy was a baby, her father died just the year before.  All she has is her cat and her apartment; there is no man in her life.  Lucy has a crush on a nameless handsome young professional (Peter Gallagher) who is a daily commuter who doesn't notice her.  On Christmas Day, Lucy works since she is the only one in her team that is without a family.  To her horror her mystery crush is mugged before her eyes and either falls or is pushed onto the tracks.  Lucy jumps onto the tracks and rescues the unconscious stranger just in the nick of time, pulling him out of the way of an oncoming train.  She accompanies him to the hospital, but at first she isn't allowed into the ER, since he's in a coma and in critical condition.  Lucy sadly muses aloud ""I was going to marry him"", she is overheard by a nurse who assumes she is the man's fiance.

The patient's family arrives understandably upset.  They are the Callaghans, the father ""Ox"",(Peter Boyle) the mother ""Midge""(Micole Mercurio), Grandma Elsie (Glynis Johns) , little sister Mary (Monica Keena) and close family friend Saul (Jack Warden).  The nurse mistakenly tells the family that Lucy is Peter's (the name of the victim) fiance.  The family warmly accepts her, and Lucy at first is embarrassed to admit the truth, and worried also that doing so might cause Grandma Elsie who has a heart condition to have an attack.  That first night Lucy returns to the hospital to sit with the comatose Peter and tells him the truth, which is overheard by Saul unseen by Lucy.  In the next couple of days, Lucy spends more time with the Callaghans and is drawn in by their quirky, yet loving ways, and begins to care deeply for them.  Saul tells Lucy he knows her secret, but will not tell the Callaghans until the right moment.  However Peter's younger brother Jack (Bill Pullman) is initially suspicious of Lucy, but he too accepts her.  As they are thrown together the friendship he feels for her deepens, as does her feeling for him.  Then on New Year's Eve, Peter awakens from his coma, but although he remembers all his family, he can't remember Lucy as his ""fiance"", and is told he has selective amnesia.  That's all, I don't want to reveal anything else, and you'll need to see the film to see how it all is resolved.

It's a shame that the Academy Awards rarely give comic or romantic comic performances the recognition they deserve.  Like Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally"", another beautifully realized portrayal, Sandra Bullock's Lucy was also ignored with not even a nomination come Oscar time.  Unfortunately, it seems the Academy will always be drawn to the heavy dramatics, even though comedy is more difficult to play.  Sandra Bullock really comes into her own as an actress in this movie.  Yes she has the atypical charm of the romantic ingnue or heroine, but in her quiet soliloquy to the unconscious Peter she has a poignancy and depth that touches the heart of the viewer.  You can empathize with Lucy's loneliness; everyone I think has been lonely at one point in their lives. Sandra Bullock in her straightforward manner, devoid of self-pity, gives Lucy a simple dignity that makes one come to care for her Lucy and root for her success.  Yet, she's winsome and charming and shows true star quality, she shines onscreen.

After the previous year's ""Sleepless in Seattle"" when Bill Pullman's character lost Meg Ryan to Tom Hanks, it was refreshing to see his character as the romantic hero, and get the girl in the process.  He has a low keyed, easy going manner, a wry sense of humor, and most importantly has a potent chemistry with Sandra Bullock.  Both bring out the best in each other.

The rest of the cast all excellent, and provide the necessary support to Bullock and Pullman to make them sparkle all the more.  Tip of the hat to Peter Gallagher as the bewildered self-absorbed Peter, Peter Boyle as Ox, doing a kinder, brighter version of his later character in ""Everyone Loves Raymond"", Jack Warden as Peter's caring godfather Saul, who's like another member of the Callaghans.  I don't want to forget the ladies, Mercole Mercurio as the cozy Midge, Glynis Johns, always a welcome addition as Grandma Elsie, Monica Keena cute without being cloying as Mary, and finally Ally Walker as Ashley, Peter's former fiance from hell.

The screenplay by Daniel G. Sullivan and Frederic LeBow is deftly written, and the Chicago locations add a nice note of authenticity.  Another plus is the opening credits rolling while Natalie Cole belts her classic ""This will be (an everlasting love)!""

Given that the film starts on Christmas Day and goes through New Year's, this has become a holiday tradition in our home, watched at least once during the Christmas season.

704478,5,6303637574,"You don't see many of these films made anymore.  So its nice to watch one again.  The mixups are very humorous, and the cast is first rate.  I think that the Lucy character represents millions of people, who yearn for some real happiness in their lives.  When Lucy bonds with Bill Pullman's family its very heartwarming to watch, the lonely girl seeking companionship, and finding it in a family setting.  In the end love conquers all, as it should be, because Lucy deserves some happiness in her life.  This film is well worth buying.  JRV",1395100800,,540,4.621052631578947

I'm sure someone in my family quotes this line every Thanksgiving: ""these mashed potatoes are so creamy...Mary mashed 'em"".

704482,5,6303637574,"I've watched several of Sandra Bullock's movies over the years. This one, which I had overlooked until recently, has to be her best. (That's saying a lot, by the way.) While the story line is a tiny bit farfetched (Lucy, a token-taker on the CTA in Chicago's Loop develops a crush on a fellow, saves him from death while he lies unconscious, having fallen on the elevated tracks, is misidentified as his fiancee, which his family, who falls in love with her, believes, and almost marries him, once he awakens from his coma), Bullock's acting and that of the other characters make this in every way a charming, uplifting movie. In fact, there isn't a character in the movie who isn't likable, and that includes the utterly obnoxious son of the owner of the apartment building in which she lives. While by no means profound, it's a movie you won't want to miss. And although it takes place during the Christmas season, it's far more than a heartwarming holiday movie. And it's definitely more than a chick flick.",1394841600,2,1010,4.679775280898877

I have found that I would watch this when it was on TV, even if it was just really good background noise running through the house speakers.

Bullock is great is her natural simplicity. But it is Pullman who is perhaps the real star with his understated but deep personality. Most supporting actors are great as well, which is a real plus.

I also find a message in this film, not sure whether it was intended by either its author or the director but here it is: be ready to change your life, because what you really wanted for a long time, and thought was impossible, might actually happen. When it does, it might not be what you expected, so again: be ready to change your target, fast.

It seems to be a recurring theme is Bullock's movies. I got a very similar message out of ""The Proposal"". I treasure it in my own life.",1363910400,,834,4.238993710691824

705637,5,6303637574,This is a good funny and romantic movie which is a love story. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman are convincing in their roles. So are everybody else. Its about a guy who falls for a girl who he thinks is his brothers fiancee. Of course the brother is in a coma so he has no way of correcting him and the rest of his family is under the same assumption. Evenually the girl falls for the brother. Id say more but that would be a spoiler and Ive already said too much. You should see this.,1362614400,,485,4.0625

Somehow, everyone gets what they want (or deserves) and it leaves you grinning at the end.

Wonderful movie and acting - several actors now gone and much missed such as Peter (Young Frankenstein) Boyle. Bill Pullman is his most wonderful, kind of dorky-but-hunky, flop-haired best. You won't regret seeing this truly heartwarming story.",1362268800,,634,5.155339805825243

She plays a Lucy, who has a crush on Peter, a guy she sees at her work every day.  He gets mugged and pushed onto train tracks and she saves him.  He ends up being in a coma and in an attempt to see how he is doing she is mistaken as his fiance.  As you can imagine chaos ensues when his family comes to the hospital and is told she is his fiance.  Bill Pullman plays the brother of Peter and also the romantic lead for Sandra Bullock.

Well, I sure hope that it was merely rescheduled for release at a later date because of some unforeseen complications, but I would like to know when. It's a good thing I didn't order it from some outside source (outside of Amazon) because I can just see where they would bill me for the order, but may never send it to me because it was suddenly being considered not to be released. Some distributors out there may never give you your money back because they would say that they made a special order for you so you can not cancel your order.

This has happened to me twice already.  I've paid for Blu-Ray orders years ago now, that have never came, nor will they refund me for my wanting to cancel the order.

A romance that will make you laugh while warming your heart.  I love watching it every year around the holidays.  Sandra was born to play Lucy.

705927,2,6303637574,"It's not that I don't watch this movie repeatedly - primarily to convince myself that I really should, just once, decorate for the holidays the way they do in this film.  The acting is often fine. I found it very difficult, however, to see 'Lucy' dressed for work, looking as though she is homeless, and without access to a shower.  A viewer can easily assume that 'Lucy' will never be happy because she thinks so little of herself.  Her hair looks dirty and unkempt, with stuck, thready, bangs, her clothing is barely that out of a bad trash bin.  (Contrast that with the coworker we see in one scene).

It's so bad, in fact, that no employer would have tolerated her appearance, making it all the more implausable, that when she is visited at work by the teenage daughter of her pseudo-'adopted' family, that the girl doesn't blink an eye at 'Lucy's forelorn appearance.  This would necessitate near sainthood or stupidity, because, clearly, this girl suffers from such low self-esteem she can't comb her hair or keep herself looking halfway nice.

It is unlikely enough that 'Peter' would want to date a token-taker, (her gain, really), without the trappings.  But 'Lucy' is so vague, even to herself, that the hot dog vendor she patronizes on a daily basis cannot remember how she takes her hot dog, but knows her supervisor's older - cold..

Her supervisor is no friend.  A very bad line where he tells her that the only way to be part of a family is to be born into it, was not only idiotic, but cruel.  Lucy is a sad case.  Jack is an angry and self-thwarted man.

Lucy would be far happier with the 100% ""true"" Joe Jr., although he would have left her when he learned how bereft the poor woman really is.",1355961600,,1712,4.537459283387622

And, haven't we all experienced ""leaning""?

And, I must say, even though I grew up in Illinois, I never made it to Chicago till I was 42, and I love the place.  So, as an added bonus now, this movie was set in Chicago.",1354752000,,552,4.20952380952381
705934,5,6303637574,"While You Were Sleeping is a movie about a lonely Chicago Transit Authority worker finding true love. Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) works in a collection booth for the Chicago Transit Authority, daydreaming about a well dressed, handsome man named Peter Callaghan (Gallagher) that is one of the daily commuters. On Christmas day, Lucy saves his life from being run over by a train, but he is left comatose. Due to an unforeseen turn of events, his family believes she is engaged to Peter. Things get even more complicated for Lucy when she meets Peter's brother, Jack (Pullman). Lucy has to juggle her feelings for Peter and Jack while trying to maintain the accidental deception to their family.

One of the things that sets While You Were Sleeping apart from other romantic comedies that came before it is that it doesn't take itself as seriously as movies like Sleepless In Seattle or When Harry Met Sally do. The comedic timing of the cast is perfect for this movie, and the comedic moments do not feel forced or contrived. The Christmas dinner scene at the Callaghan house may remind you of your own family gatherings. While You Were Sleeping is one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time.

While You Were Sleeping is rated PG for some language. It is a great romantic comedy that the whole family can enjoy.",1354752000,,1313,4.754385964912281

705985,3,6303637574,"WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING evokes my usual emotional reaction to standard chick flicks.  Indifference.  Ambivalence.  Mas y menos.  Occasional yawns.  Occasional chuckles.  Occasional urges to change the channel.  The story is at least intriguing.  A bored, lonely transit token taker (try to say that fast three times) named Lucy (Sandra Bullock) has a crush on a suave passenger she sees on a daily basis; only the suave dude named Peter (Peter Gallagher) has no idea he is the object of Lucy's heartfelt desires.  One unfortunate day Peter is mugged alongside the subway tracks and is knocked unconscious; alarmed, Lucy leaves her booth and pulls him off the tracks before Peter becomes subway road pizza.  She accompanies him to the nearest hospital, and via a chain of awkward events tells staffers she is Peter's fiance, then sticks to her story when Peter's concerned family rushes in.  Thus Peter lies in a coma as Lucy digs herself into a deeper hole, then falls in love with Peter's family, then especially falls in love with Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman).  And of course Jack falls for Lucy, which makes him torn between his feelings for her and his devotion to his brother (who is unaware all of this is taking place).  Everything rolls predictably to the inevitable ""come clean"" scene--right at the altar, mind you--causing Lucy to experience considerable angst, followed by the kittens and butterflies ending.

Bullock was born to play the lead in chick flicks, and here she's good as the lonely, somewhat frumpish spinster in need of a shake-up in her meandering life.  Pullman is rather wooden, while Gallagher gets the lion's share of comedic facial expressions (by the end of this film, his character becomes the definition of confused).  Other performances include Peter Boyle as the father of the brothers, and Jack Warden as an ornery, somewhat cantankerous old family friend and godfather to Peter.  The class warfare subplot is duly noted; Peter is a successful lawyer, yet somewhat of a lout, while Jack is the hardworking blue collar yeoman with aspirations of building furniture as a career.  How noble.  In any event, if chick flicks are your cup of joe then WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING will float your boat.  One viewing, however, is enough for moi; I would be sleeping if I were to attempt to re-watch WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.

Sandra Bullock (Lucy Eleanor Moderatz) is a lonely CTA worker in downtown Chicago until she rescues Peter Gallagher when he falls on the railroad tracks. Her world is flipped upside down by a mistake, and only she can reveal the truth, the problem is she is too modest and embarrased to do so. Peter Boyle (RIP) and Glynis Johns are hilarious!

Bill Pullman, not one of my favorites, is adequate as the brother who unwillingly accepts then falls in love with her.  The added touch of ""Joe Jr"" is just icing on the cake. For some reason, Sandra Bullock only uses her whiney nasal voice in comedies. I've seen her in dramatic roles where this is absent and she is a wonderful dramatic actress.

When Peter get pushed off of the train platform, Lucy saves his life by moving him off of the tracks. The fall leaves Peter in a coma.  Through a misunderstanding, Peter's family believes that Lucy is Peter's fiancee.

Or which I would want to re-watch on a yearly basis.

""When Harry met Sally"" is another one that I love and can watch over and over again.
I think ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is o.k., but doesn't come even close to the class and style that WYWS and WHMS possess.",1316390400,,598,4.155172413793103
706041,1,6303637574,"This movie starts off well; A ticket attendant, Lucy, sees a handsome business man everyday at the ticket window. She gradually falls for him, until one day a chance accident causes Lucy to be heroic and saves the man's life. Perhaps this is her chance to win the guy over.

She meets his family at the hospital where 'Peter' lies in a come. They all love her and think she's a great catch. They buy her story she's the girlfriend and the scene is set; She will just have to hope that when Peter wakes up he will think it's a great idea too.

Okay, simple, cheesy, yeah, kind of predictable, but effective. What a love story!

But, maybe 'cause it was the 90's (or maybe the writers stuffed up) they throw in a twist. Along comes Peter's brother. Jack. Jack is as smug as he is full-of-himself, swaggering and confident. Lucy is clearly smitten as he talks himself up.
And then, if that wasn't bad enough, he suddenly turns into this sensitive, sad person who has self-esteem issues because he's a working class guy and no-one wants him, they want his rich, business man brother. Teenage-angst hogwash.

If seeing Jack go from 'I'm a big man who drives big trucks and lifts heavy furniture' to 'poor me, no one wants a low-income earner like me' is cringe-worthy enough, even worse is his teenage-like whining about his father 'forcing' him to be a furniture deliverer in the family business. The guy's pushing 40 for crying out loud! He confronts his father for a 'I don't want to be a truck driver to deliver furniture, I want to MAKE furniture'. Dare I be cynical and suggest they could have chosen something a bit more removed from the earlier career and gone with 'Accountant' or, I dunno 'Astronaut'. His father reacts with a rather calm 'Okay', as if what's the big deal about, though you were expecting Jack to burst into tears and his dad runs over and hugs him, ""Oh sorry, I didn't realise I was hurting you all those years by forcing you to be a truck driver"".

The most disappointing bit is when Peter wakes from his coma. He falls madly for Lucy as the original plot would have dictated. But no feel-good-happy-ending here folks. Although various women turn up claiming to be his lovers, and despite everyone saying he's a sleazebag, he actually seems like a nice person who is genuinely interested in Lucy, he kind of sees her as a 'good girl' and wants to settle down with her. He reckons 'she's really something'. Someone should have told that to the people who made this film. Rating 1.5/5.0",1313452800,4,2508,4.55210643015521

706097,5,6303637574,"My television set was left on the Oxygen network with ""While You Were Sleeping"" just playing right now, and it reminded me how I never get tired watching this movie. I've seen about 98% of Sandra Bullock's movies, and Sandra Bullock is absolutely one of my favorite actresses of all time. I've honestly never been disappointed with any Sandra Bullock film I've seen. Maybe it's because I have so much respect for Sandra Bullock as both an actress and a real human being that I always see the good and the positive in every film she has done. Sandra Bullock is very real, authentic, honest, genuine, and down-to-earth in her performances just like she in real life. Anyways, when it comes to Sandra Bullock's comedies, this movie is my favorite. I've seen this movie many times, and have it on VHS and DVD formats. I really don't need to pop in the DVD though because this movie has had many television airings. Like many Amazon reviewers have already said, Sandra is very charming, endearing, funny, and adorable in this movie. And there is good chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. The rest of the cast give great performances. This movie personally hits close to home because I was raised in Illinois, and this movie was filmed in Chicago. A lot of people, including me, can relate to Lucy's (Sandra Bullock) loneliness, especially during the holidays. You can't help but root for Lucy when she finds happiness with the Callaghan family. There are many great scenes in this movie - the Callaghan family dinner scene, Lucy feeding Peter's cat, Peter trying to test his memory by saying the alphabet (this scene brought out laughs from the audience when I first saw this movie in the movie theater), Jack giving Lucy the snow globe, Lucy saying she finally got a stamp on her passport, etc. This movie is just a heartwarming movie. When you feel down, watch this movie. I appreciate every movie that Sandra Bullock has made. And I appreciate Sandra Bullock more as a human being in real life. Sandra Bullock is a wonderful human being. Sandra was very classy in the way she handled her divorce. All I can say is that any man would be extremely lucky to have Sandra Bullock as his significant other if Sandra even decides to take the time to venture in the romance department again. I'm very happy for Sandra that she has another ""man"" in her life - her cute and adorable adopted son, Louis Bardo. I admire Sandra's determination and strength in raising her adopted son alone. Sandra Bullock is a great role model when it comes to her humility and generosity - never hesitating in giving lots of her money to those who need it - victims of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, Haiti earthquake, Japan earthquake, etc. And I love Sandra's wit and sense of humor. You can see many glimpses of Sandra's honorable and endearing character throughout her huge film catalog. I really think ""While You Were Sleeping"" is a movie that displays Sandra Bullock at her best besides her Oscar-winning perforamce for ""The Blind Side"". It's very hard not to smile while watching this film. If you haven't seen this film, please wake up, and watch ""While You Were Sleeping""!",1302912000,,3194,4.73608617594255

706199,5,6303637574,While You Were Sleeping is one of my favorite feel good movies.  Wore my VHS tape out and replaced with the disc. Sandra Bullock is just adorable in this film.,1264982400,2,159,4.3
706200,5,6303637574,"Cute Sandra Bullock's attractive good looks are tremendously down-played in this enchanting romantic comedy of ""Love at Second Sight.""  The costume designer has her dressed in baggy sweaters, shapeless ankle-length skirts, and over-sized jackets because she is supposed to be a Chicago Transit Authority in a dead-end job with no future.  Seeing Bullock's leading lady attractiveness so down-played through out the movie is one of the movies cute quirks.

You can read the plot summaries in the over 200 other reviews here.  Part of what I like so much with watching ""While You Were Sleeping"" again and again is how the leading men in the film are portrayed as real men - working men both, 1 a yuppie (Peter Gallagher), 1 a blue-collar furniture maker (Bill Pullman).  So many romances take the masculinity away from the men in the movie.  A fun additional appearance is made by Michael Rispoli as Joe Jr. who became later better known in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos/dp/B002OID4VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos</a>.  Then enchanting qualities of the family and how that is part of the whole package which Lucy craves in romance is darling and totally understandable.  I am half in love with them, too.

Amusingly enough, the original release date of the film was in April when the whole plot takes place around Christmas, New Year's and Epiphany.  An enchanting addition to my Christmas holiday viewings now.  Highly recommend.",1262649600,3,1497,5.465217391304348

706202,5,6303637574,"Why is this film so magnetically appealing? It superbly joins the human machinations of caring, loving hearts with some of the most hilarious situations written for the big screen. You find yourself laughing and crying in the very same places every time this movie is viewed.

This is tale of romance concerns Lucy, a dreamy romantic who supports herself by working in a token booth for the Chicago Transit Authority. She becomes infatuated with a certain commuter, a handsome man whom she considers her ""Prince Charming"". Although she sees every day she's never spoken to him-he doesn't notice her as he deposits his token to ride the train on his way to work.

She has the early shift one cold Christmas Day. There aren't many riders, no security guard on the platform and she's bored. Her crush arrives, deposits his token, wishes her a Merry Christmas-the first time he's spoken to her and before she can say a word, saunters off to board the train. As he's waiting two muggers push him onto the tracks and he's injured.

Lucy runs out of the booth and jumps on the tracks intent on helping her Prince. He's unconscious and with barely a second to spare, she hurriedly rolls them both away from an oncoming express train. After the rescue she goes to the hospital to make sure he's all right. On her arrival she is denied the opportunity to see him, she isn't ""family"". This disappointment is evident, ""oh, I was going to marry him"", but a nurse overhears. She's finally allowed to see him when she's escorted to ICU to see the unconscious man whom the nurse believes is his fiance!

She's there briefly when his family arrive; they're upset over the accident that has left their son, Peter, unconscious and in a deep coma. Then chaos erupts as they learn he's not only injured but is engaged! The family's overjoyed that their son's rescuer is also his fiance and embrace Lucy as one of their own. But Grandma has a heart condition-having had several attacks, so to spare them any more distress, she remains silent.

Lucy can't explain this terrible misunderstanding to Peter's family, so in the wee hours of the 26th she decides to visit the hospital to tell the truth to HIM! Although he can't hear her, she tells Peter everything. She just wants the ""normal stuff"" in life, then adds, ""I've never met anybody I can laugh with"", and in tears she says, ""you ever fall in love with someone you've never talked to? You ever been so alone you spend the night confusing a man in a coma?""

To show the depth of the Lucy's unsolvable dilemma the camera pans left to reveal the saddened but wiser Saul-a good friend of Peter's family, standing behind the glass of Peter's room in ICU as he, too, hears Lucy's heartbreaking story. As she's pouring her heart out to Peter, Saul can't and won't say a word about all he's heard, sighs, turns and quietly leaves. This brief glimpse of Saul's perplexed but resigned expression endeared him to me forever! In fact the end of this scene put an arrow through MY soul the very first time I viewed this movie, a hole that continues to widen every time I watch Lucy's poignantly lovely story.

She meets the family as she's leaving, having spent the night at Peter's bedside. The Callaghans ask Lucy to come and share their Christmas celebration and rather than being alone, decides to attend. She arrives at their home where Saul greets her, and during the conversation that follows Saul reveals that he's actually Peter's Godfather! When asked about Lucy's parents, we see a most gentle, introspective, modest young woman. Clearly none of that which is ""high and mighty"" can be detected in this beautiful young woman, as it's revealed the passing of both parents has left a terrible void and there is no one in her life to fill that emptiness.

The COAT you see Lucy wearing throughout the story had belonged to her late Father. It's her visible defense-Lucy's shield against the big, cruel, mean-spirited world. This coat represents her Father's presence-his protection; one of the only things she can cling to of his and the warm caring love he had for his only child. Another reminder of just how ""alone"" this beautiful girl is as she makes her way through her solitary existence.

Peter's family welcomes her-they're all delighted by her presence and she's ushered in to their home. How could your heart not go out to one that is ONLY looking for companionship during the Christmas Season? Seeking company to enjoy a little Holiday cheer isn't bad reason for perpetuating a lie, which Saul approves. She definitely passed muster, because after all, he IS Peter's Godfather, who should know better?  You get Saul's approval-with a wink and a smile, and you're definitely ""in"", and that's for darn sure!

To this moment Lucy emotions have been on hold-dormant. But as she basks in the radiant warmth of this loving family, our beautiful girl simply blossoms then blooms, smiling broadly and often. Lucy's eyes are definitely the windows of her soul, as those lovely eyes light and brilliantly shine with pleasure as she watches-with enthralled delight, the Callaghans celebrate their belated Christmas.

NOW, this is the point where Lucy's story really takes off. Because the belated Christmas celebration ends so late, she's asked to stay over and sleeps on the living room sofa. In the early hours of the morning of the 27th, we are introduced to Jack, Peter's younger brother who actually conducts the family's estate furniture business. He's the very hardworking individual that has returned to his parents' home after several days of nonstop work.

When Jack walks in he meets Mary and there's a noisy greeting. She says, ""don't wake Lucy"" Jack asks ""who's Lucy?"" and she's says she's Peter's fiance. He sees her and is skeptical. Mary asks, ""You haven't met her?"" Jack's comeback, ""No"", and Mary's reply, ""Oh, she's great, you're going to love her!"" This exchange always makes me gleefully laugh, it's so prophetic! Lucy overhears and knows she'll have to leave early if she wants to avoid his scrutiny.

It's so much fun to watch Jack's reaction to Lucy; he actually does a double take as he locks onto that beautiful face. This IS Love at first sight-NOT for Lucy, but FOR Jack! She's trying to leave as quietly as possible, but he's been waiting for her to appear. He's sitting on the stairs reading a paper and as she's walking towards the door he startles her with, ""Good Morning"". She gasps and quickly turns to face him and stands before him appearing so radiantly lovely. Watch his shoulders hunch as he's talking to Lucy. His chest is heaving and his breathing is getting faster as he's trying to deal with the sudden rush of emotion as sees her for the first time.

Lucy doesn't know what to do, she's been caught entirely by surprise and as she's frozen to the spot, twiddling her fingers as a nervous device. As the taxi sounds its horn she says, ""OOH, CAB"", and hastily explains the reason she has to leave as her only deflection to Jack's burning stare. She's really made a positive impression on this obviously red-blooded male; as she quickly leaves he is smiling wryly. He definitely likes what he's seen of this young woman named Lucy! But who is she? Peter's never mentioned her. After Jack attends Mass with his parents he drives to her apartment seeking that vision of a young woman that he's just met, whose image he can't get out of his mind and heart.

And where is Lucy? She sets off for Peter's apartment solely to fulfill a mission of mercy, to feed the cat she KNOWS must be in Peter's apartment-having found that can of cat food amongst his things that were given to her at the hospital. She goes to Peter's apartment on that mission, then intended to leave Peter's apartment as quickly as she had come. Having missed Lucy when he went to her apartment, Jack goes to Peter's and lets himself in to check Peter's place to make sure everything's OK. He can hear a feminine voice that he finds very suspicious! It's Lucy. She tries to find and feed the cat, and her act of benevolence is met with almost open hostility. When Lucy tells Jack she's there to feed the cat, he doesn't believe her until out walks the cat!

As they both leave for the hospital, you must watch Jack very closely! As they approach Peter's car Jack covertly takes a deep breath-which only the audience sees, of Lucy's essence as she walks by him just to taste her with his olfactory senses to further confirm what he already liked about her as he first looked her up and down in Peter's apartment!

At the hospital Jack badgers her about being Peter's fiance. I absolutely loathed those loaded questions designed to test her knowledge of Peter. They were abrasive and difficult to take, but it's fun to watch her allay his suspicions with logical answers to every question he asked. She finally dispels all doubt by telling a secret about Peter (he has ONE testicle!) that only she knows. Once it's determined what Lucy has stated really is true, there's no lingering doubt that Lucy is, indeed, Peter's fiance!

She goes back to her apartment completely exhausted by her efforts to avoid being exposed as the ""fake"" fiance, when she's immediately visited by a succession of callers. Joe Jr., the apartment owner's son marches in to accuse her of standing him up for a date that she can't remember, then Saul arrives. To hide Joe from Saul she pushes him into a closet. Saul tells her he knows the ""truth"" and advises her to not to tell the Callaghans, to which she reluctantly agrees. She's dealing with Joe (who's been trying on her shoes!), when Jack comes to deliver an engagement present from his parents. Suddenly, Lucy's apartment becomes Grand Central Station! Jack hears a noise in Lucy's apartment-it's Joe in her closet. Lucy claims it's a cat and to avoid any more problems she suggests the present be taken to Peter's apartment. There's more noise and Lucy quickly decides to go with him.

Here we see Lucy and Jack in a purely non-adversarial mode, each has finally begun to let down their guard. Jack opens the back of the truck to reveal her engagement surprise. Lucy's eyes go directly to a rocking chair strapped to the side of the truck. She LOVES it! Jack tells her he made it himself, then points out the actual present, a love seat. She apologizes for her mistake and asks to sit in the rocking chair. She tries it out and likes it so much that she suggests he go into business, but he feels compelled to stay with the family business.

Lucy gladly helps Jack wheel the love seat to Pete's apartment, which pleasingly surprises him. She's bouncy, bubbly, giggling and excited, so cute! When they get back to the truck, they find it's been blocked from being moved by other cars. Lucy then decides to leave and says good night. But Jack doesn't want to be left alone in city, so with a smile and nod in the direction of her apartment, she invites him to walk with her.

The conversation on the way back is charmingly designed to allow these two to become better acquainted. Since they had only met that morning; neither of them knew anything about the other so this was the perfect opportunity. Here, the true character of each is revealed. Lucy confides that her Dad had died the year before and ""I don't even remember my Mom"". She also hopes to travel, and Florence, Italy is her destination of choice.

And Lucy finds Jack is a very regular guy and is the first person that Lucy has met that she can actually laugh with. His comments like: ""making conversation keeps my face from freezing"" elicits a high feminine giggle. After they take that spill on the icy walkway in front of her apartment building, just to avoid provoking another fall, Lucy says, ""you don't have to follow me"", and as Jack trails her he says, ""no, you block the wind"". Then you hear an immediate, sustained laugh from Lucy, as she instantly understands what he's said. That dry sense of humor of Jack's surprises her and is also one of the most pleasing aspects of this extremely attractive and nice guy!

During the slip on the ice Jack supports Lucy to keep her from falling, she pulls herself up very close to his face. Their up-close encounter makes him completely light-headed and he's so dizzy that he couldn't keep her or himself upright on the icy walkway. Not only did she ""get under his skin"" on the very first day they met, but she made him dizzy EVERY time she was near. You can see this as she's going back into her apartment; she's left him grinning and scratching his head trying to clear the effects of their tte--tte.

You then see Lucy's priceless expression as she grins watching Jack from her window. He climbs over the Christmas lights in front of her building, grabs his torn back pocket to hide the tear, and marches back to his truck. First she thinks, ""he looks so cute"" then, ""he's so very funny!"" Watch Lucy's face; Jack's made her laugh, they just went through a falling-on-the-ice trauma-which wasn't tragic but was considered funny by both, her expression becomes almost somber. She's fallen in love with him!

The next day we find Jack has discovered his brother's fiance is a fabulously attractive girl, a nice, polite, considerate one with a great sense of humor too. As Jack is playing mock-poker with his comatose brother, he tells Peter he's never envied Peter's anything that he had, ""'til now"". As he lifts his face and looks up-both eyes wide open, we can see he, too, has fallen in love! Then he declares that the cutting of the deck will produce the high card that will result in the beautiful Lucy, as the winner's coveted prize

On New Year's Eve-immediately after he hears Lucy is pregnant from Mary, you see Jack instantly disappear as he makes a beeline straight to Lucy. Let's face it, he would much rather spend New Year's Eve with Lucy than with his family. Besides, Jack sorely misses Lucy's company, since he feels downright comfortable, so natural around her. So his quest to learn if Lucy ""pregnant"" or not was merely a pretext-it was the excuse he needed to see this lovely girl again.

A few days into their relationship hasn't made much difference, YUP, STILL getting light-headed! Still in LOVE but it's getting deeper and more dangerous. Jack follows Lucy to Celeste's apartment after he drops her there.  Watch: as soon as Lucy goes in Jack is scratching his head after their brief conversation about Peter, he walks right into Celeste's apartment after Lucy, which he had no intention of doing at all!

At the New Year's Eve party, where all of Lucy's CTA friends are attending, Jack warns Lucy not to drink the spiked punch, ""it's not good for the baby!"" The mortified Lucy flees Celeste's apartment and walks quickly to her apartment with Jack following close behind. He's trying to apologize and when arrive at her apartment; Jack describes the ""leaning thing"" he witnessed as Lucy embraced Joe Jr. to thank him for the flowers he had given her earlier in the evening. And to get that New Year's kiss from our girl, demonstrates some leaning of his own.

It's amazing that Lucy was NEVER aware of the magical electric effect she had on Jack EVERY time she was with him. If sparks didn't fly for Lucy, they definitely did for him! It's fun to see the gyrations Jack went through and the faux pas' he committed; things that this really down-to-earth, usually ""level-headed"" guy would never have done under any other circumstances, except in her presence.

He takes the leaning as far as he can to get that kiss-he's so smitten that this affliction called love is reaching CRITICAL MASS! Notice his shirttail is out every time he's around her? Guess he's got something to conceal, which is definitely ""hard"" to hide. Oh, come on now, YOU just have to laugh with ME here!

But his eager attempt at intimacy is thwarted when it's implied Lucy became pregnant just to ""snag"" his brother. Lucy is so offended that she walks away in disgust and starts back to her apartment. Jack makes the whole situation worse by saying that she's ""not really Peter's type"". She pointedly asks, ""Whose type am I?"" He refuses to respond, and Lucy becomes really angry. There ensues a heated exchange that results with the feelings of both quite painfully hurt.

Meanwhile, Peter finally comes out of his coma in the wee hours of New Year's Day. It's a joyous relief that Peter is conscious again to everyone concerned. But this only serves to add another formidable obstacle to Lucy and Jack's relationship. Who really is Peter? He's a successful attorney, a handsome, shallow individual who's in love with himself! He's also totally oblivious to the things he chooses not to see; a conscious vegetable that, regrettably, is only concerned with that which is cosmetic and superficial. A prime example: his beautiful ""perfect model"", but vitriolic ""married woman"" fiance, Ashley. She looks great, but is a ghastly awful, unsympathetic ""scary"" shrew. Can't tell a book by its cover couldn't be a better description of this coma-guy!

Peter recognizes everyone but Lucy, and she acutely feels the awkward discomfort around the conscious Peter who is surrounded by his family. Although he's told she's his fiance he doesn't recognize her because it's determined he has amnesia! Subsequently, he too becomes convinced that he has memory loss. Lucy can barely keep up her ruse now and she begs Saul to tell the Callaghans she's not his fiance. But Saul is no help with her desperate situation, and although Lucy is supposed to be engaged to Peter she sure doesn't act like his happy fiance.

The Callaghans leave the hospital after the doctor orders them to go home, then it's left to Jack to drive Lucy back to her apartment. It's REALLY quiet-not a sound can be heard in the cab of the truck, the tension is palpable and the silence is deafening! You can see Jack twisting in the driver's seat as he glances over at Lucy, and she's is still madder than a wet hen at Jack for having caused her the embarrassment of implying she was pregnant in front of not only her all her friends and acquaintances, but to his family as well.

But she finally relents and has forgiven Jack by the time they reach her apartment. Jack is honestly apologetic for the emotional pain he's caused, and Lucy-with her conciliatory words, in turn expresses that she's grateful that he's ""become a ""really good friend"". She's just hoping they can just remain friends and he will at least speak to her after he learns the ""truth"". To Lucy there doesn't seem to be anything else here. Jack hasn't expressed any feelings she can detect or comprehend as an overture of love, so she settles for ""friend"" as the alternative. Better friends than nothing, right?

Even now she really doesn't know much Jack cares, because he's taken such great pains to hide-as best as he can, the all-consuming passion he has for her. Jack, on the other hand, says, ""good friend"", almost with disdain. Is this all he IS to Lucy? He thinks being merely her good friend is a joke-a pittance, in light of what he really feels for this girl whom he secretly and desperately loves. But he sucks it up, apologizes and says-in reference to Peter and she and their future together, ""I'm really glad you won't be alone anymore"". Jack really is a nice guy and a good brother, isn't he!

Then Saul decides to meddle-with good intentions of course, but throws a wrench in the Lucy and Jack-works! He has that very crucial talk with Peter and imparts that all-important message of being a ""putz"". Regarding Lucy, Saul tells Peter she's not only his fiance, but she saved his life. He suggests that Peter marry her, ""before she has a chance to escape!""  Wise words from a wise man, the man who just happens to be his Godfather. How could Peter ignore such sound advice given by one who's been a part of his life from the very beginning?

Peter takes Saul's words to heart and decides to get better acquainted with his fiance whom his family adores, and who also just happens to have saved his life. He has a heightened good opinion of her now, and to reform his errant ways he makes his noble proposal of marriage, but only after Ashley has dumped him-for a second time.  Marriage on the rebound isn't good in any situation, but in this instance it was the worst thing Peter could have done.  He didn't even know Lucy; in fact he didn't know she was even alive before his rescue!

But Lucy probably accepted his lame proposal, ""my family loves you, I might as well love you!"" because she didn't want to hurt his feelings and was sorry for him. After all he is the rich and handsome man of her dreams-her Prince Charming, who seems so truly grateful about having that ""second chance"" in life. He enthusiastically states that he wants to start a family, ""someone to have a son with"". She must have reluctantly accepted, and besides, who could resist a proposal of marriage made with such sincerity?

The news of Lucy's acceptance of Peter's marriage proposal must have been very hard to deal with and accept. Once again Jack has lost the most important of ""draws"" to Peter. He must have become resigned to this ""bad"" news, and to express his good wishes to Lucy of the impending happy event decides to give her a personal gift.

And what a gift it was! It's that ""SPECIAL GIFT""; remember the beginning of Lucy's narration of ""her life"", of the GLOBE WITH THE LIGHT IN IT, that her Mother gave to her Father? This very lighted globe can be seen glowing brightly behind Jack, as he steps back to reveal it after he's given that simple snow globe of ""Florence"" to Lucy. Actually it's a small plaster model of the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore, one of the best known landmarks in the city of Florence-this sounds like a guided walking tour doesn't it!

And thanks to her he was finally jolted out of his complacency and told his Father he didn't want to continue the family business so he could start a furniture-making business of his own. He really owes Lucy a debt of gratitude indeed! Jack delights in viewing the girl he loves at her most cute and adorable-in her jammies. He's heroically resisting the undeniable urge to embrace her; but turns and quickly exits.

Because he's given her that ""special gift"" Lucy REALLY loves Jack now-this is the CLINCHER! She follows and stops his hasty retreat by calling his name. He turns to look up at her lovely face-those imploring eyes, ""can you give me any reason why I shouldn't marry your brother?"" but is painfully forced to deny the love he feels by claiming, ""I can't"". This is the girl he not only dearly loves, but is the one for whom he has the most profound respect! He then SLAMS, literally bangs his way out of her apartment building in AGONY. He's so ACHINGLY in love with her, but isn't able-out of loyalty to his brother, to express it. Lucy tearfully decides to marry Peter; there's no alternative since Jack hadn't declared his true feelings.

She and Peter are to be married in the hospital chapel where Jack's agony is further exacerbated as he realizes his brother is a heartless snake that would ultimately break Lucy's heart, ""I've never been faithful to a woman"". He writhes in pain; Peter is marrying the girl he simply ADORES! Jack tells Peter ""YOU SUCK"" because he SO meant it. He's so disgusted with Peter and distraught that he's almost crying.

Jack's frustration with the situation is evident, and by the time Lucy appears he's positively livid. As she's walking down the aisle, he's absolutely startled-her hair is all up and back, she's STUNNING! Lucy's just a scintillating, incandescent VISION! He all but audibly gasps at the sight of her and then quickly smiles. Jack then falls into the throes of the worst abject despair he's ever felt in his life. He really IS going to lose this BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL girl to Peter!

But Lucy pauses and realizes the terrible mistake she's making, and halts the ceremony with, ""I object!"" Although Jack is surprised and as he unblinkingly stares into that lovely face-still dumbfounded by her unspoiled natural beauty, he adds, ""I would have to object too"", and when Peter is asked by the priest, ""what about you?"" he replies, ""I'm thinking"". ALL of this odd dialogue amongst the primary participants of this marriage ceremony definitely demands an explanation!

So begins Lucy's sad admission of the Truth. She admits she actually loves...Jack! The parents are astounded. After Lucy painfully confesses she's never been engaged to Peter, Jack is almost in tears when he asks, ""Why didn't you say something?"" she then whispers, ""Because I didn't know how to tell you"". Jack suppresses a smile; he KNOWS this is just like something Lucy would do! Lucy always and invariably spares EVERYONE any kind of pain or offense, EVERYONE, indeed, but herself.

She painfully tells Peter, ""I might have saved your life on the tracks that day, but you know what? You saved mine! You allowed me to be part of your family, and I haven't had that in a really long time, and I just didn't want to let go of that. So even though it was just for a little while, I will Love them (his family), ALWAYS!""

She starts out of the chapel and the last person to whom she bids good-bye is Saul. With a quick smile she lifts her hand-she understands and has forgiven him for not telling the Callaghans the truth before she had to admit it herself, then she's gone. What turmoil the actual truth must have left in Lucy's wake! The family must have felt absolutely terrible about Lucy-the young woman they all have come to love, but Jack probably had other feelings to consider.

This shocking revelation must have hit like a bombshell, an incendiary ordinance that left Jack literally devastated. The confession that Lucy loved HIM was very gratifying, but what of Lucy's truly pitiable reason for having lied in the first place? It was so simple, but so incredibly...sad. Lucy had endured so much emotional pain, angst, suffering and humiliation just so she could spend a few days of relative happiness with his family, people whom she considered so very nice. Jack must have-with cringing regret, lamented every harsh word and emotional pain he had inflicted on this beautiful girl. Had I been Jack I wouldn't have been able to contemplate this entire affair-at all, but with the most serious...contrition. So Jack's reaction to the truth was probably nothing short of SOUL WRENCHING!

The only consolation to Jack's anguish over Lucy and her situation: Lucy is the ANGEL of a NICE girl-a one of a kind spunky, smart, and BEAUTIFUL woman that he had always hoped to meet! She had never been one of Peter's casual girlfriends-a castoff of his numerous failed relationships, so it was wonderful to find Lucy really DID possess the irreproachable character that he has so happily found was hers! HIS ""type"" of girl, NOT Peter's!

During the marriage proposal Jack says, ""Lucy, I have to ask you a question"" and asks Lucy if he can go into the booth, and Lucy responds, ""I can't"". Jack is momentarily taken aback, and she says with a tiny smile, ""not without a token"". Jack gives her that look, ""oh you -"", obviously these two love to playfully needle each other even at this critical juncture! He deposits his token, she opens the door and he smiles then walks in.

With the proper humility, the most tender of looks and a slight smile, Jack says the two simple words, ""Marry Me?"" characteristically to the point, NO FRILLS. Lucy says: ""I Love YOU"", and his smiling response: ""I Love You BACK!"" It's just like Jack-his speech patterns are so short and matter-of-fact, always sardonically and laconically oblique. In the case of this lovely pair the LESS said is definitely MORE! And by this time Jack KNOWS how fragile-like the thinnest delicate glass is Lucy's lovely Heart. If not carefully approached this kind heart would easily break, so the proposal had to be made with the utmost care.

During the proposal we see the Callaghans and Saul; there are some who wonder why they're there at all! Well, they happen to be THE integral part of Lucy's story. They all but say as they're standing in locked-shoulders formation, ""we now know ALL, Saul has probably told them EVERYTHING. We LOVE YOU, Jack LOVES YOU, PLEASE, marry so YOU can become A REAL member of our family, WE & HE, NEED and WANT you SO MUCH!"" They encourage Lucy with their expressions and all but CHEER! You know what...I DID! And with tears of sheer JOY, applaud-VERY LOUDLY, too!

Upon reflection, the lovely marriage proposal is an almost MOOT moment for THIS terrific pair. Both Lucy and Jack FULLY KNOW and UNDERSTAND that neither one can make it through the rest of their lives without the other. So the affirmation of this lifetime bond-it's REALLY WONDERFUL to be formally asked and it's even MORE WONDERFUL to be formally accepted. It's not only the VITALLY NECESSARY exchange that just had to be made by this wonderful couple, it's just the FABULOUS FINISHING TOUCH to this lovely story of Lucy and Jack's LOVE EVERLASTING!

Ponder this if you will, Lucy and Jack's paths would have never crossed had she not saved Peter life that fateful day. She wasn't even going to stay to visit the Callaghans on the 26th knowing she didn't belong there, lost the courage to approach their home and would have left hadn't Saul stopped her. And Jack wouldn't have known Lucy was in his parents' home had Mary not drawn his attention to her presence, and as a result made the decision to stay the night so that he could introduce himself to Lucy on the morning of the 27th. So by the narrowest margins and by the smallest bit of fortunate chance did they encounter each other at all and only by mere coincidence, at that! BRAVO, to the writers of the script of this wonderful film, Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow, and to Jon Turteltaub for his unerring and canny direction, LOVED every word and every scene!

Lucy will always love Jack who's as steady and lovable as her late Dad, and is so cutely handsome to boot! And Jack adores his fabulous Lucy whom he's had the extraordinary good fortune to marry. There's no divorce among Catholics so their marriage really is a forever-deal! And there will be no more hauling a heavy Christmas tree through an open window with a rope, one story up, if Jack's around! This is a bit much, OK a LOT much, but this is honestly the way these two must have felt about their romance by the end of their amazing story.

KUDOS to ALL that supported Lucy in her quest for TRUE & ENDURING LOVE!

To the loving and hilarious Callaghan family that took this beautiful young woman in out of the goodness of their hearts, and were as delighted with Lucy as she was in love with them.

To Saul who knew the truth all along but was hoping to redeem his ""putz"" godson by convincing him to marry Lucy, knowing what a wonderful girl she was to promote that ""clean start"" Peter himself, described.

To her boss Jerry, Thanks for your role as Lucy's reluctant interpersonal relations counselor.

To Joe Jr. Thanks for dropping your overbearing ways, even though you still have a definite leaning towards ladies' footwear.

To Wanda, thanks for making amends for the honest mistake by helping Lucy in her attempt to tell Peter she wasn't his fiance.

Thanks to Mel her cat for Mel's moral support and timely fashion tips.

To the paperboy taking that spill off his bike EVERYONE slips and falls and is a hilarious visual metaphor-all of us are prone to unforeseen accidents, we're all so vulnerable!

I can imagine Lucy as the contented homemaker with a houseful of good Catholic kids, the bookkeeper and irresistibly friendly promoter of Jack's furniture business, and the BEST? As pointed out by Lucy herself, as explained to Peter: Lucy and Jack fell in Deep & Forever LOVE While You Were Sleeping!

To Sandra Bullock, to Bill Pullman and to the entire Cast of this FABULOUS movie, BRAVO! Your performances are COMPLETELY, ABSOLUTELY & SINGULARLY WONDERFUL!

And, do I UTTERLY LOVE this MOVIE? Like Jerry Wallace said to Lucy when he asked if there was really a CTA ""employee of the month"", and by Jack, when asked by Peter if Lucy was ""pretty terrific""...OH YEAH!",1262563200,4,32159,4.678110069014334
706203,5,6303637574,"Perhaps my favorite romantic film of all time, on par with Ever After and Only You (also highly recommended), that I've watched at least a hundred times since I was a little girl.  It is Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock at their best, along with the rest of the amazing cast, Peter Boyle, Peter Galagher, and Jack Warden.  This is the ultimate family romantic comedy, tieing in a lovely Christmas theme-Bullock's character doesn't have a family and is 'adopted' by Bill Pullman's at Christmas, along with an interesting twist on what would be her ultimate romantic fantasy.  Bullock has eyed this gorgeous man, Peter Galagher, everyday at the train station ticket booth, attempting to make the first hints of conversation-but fails-until she is forced into his life by a freak accident where she must rescue him from impending death on the train tracks.  A mix-up at the hospital makes her family believe she is not only the now comatose Peter's rescuer, but fiance!  She attempts to tell the truth but gets so emotionally pulled into the family with her needing them to have someone to spend a lonely Christmas with, and them needing her to hold onto Peter while they wait for him to wake from the coma, that she simply plays along with the lie but oops! Eventually starts falling for her dream man's brother!  It shows many moral lessons, one that love is getting to know a person, not falling into an infatuation with their image everyday, and the appreciation of having a family to come home to for Christmas.  I highly recommend this movie for children and adults, it is filled with heartwarming and hilarious (as in the case of Joe Fusco, Jr.) characters that you will love for ages.",1260316800,,1688,4.7406143344709895

Granted, in real life that's so unlikely as to be effectively impossible, but I still dare them to imagine they wouldn't get mentally and emotionally knocked for a loop when events rush up and overwhelm the parameters of their lives like this.

At any rate, the fun is in how Lucy and the Callaghan's - who owe Lucy BIG TIME, never mind the misunderstandings - become family. That's not to say the the romance isn't an enjoyable one - Bullock and Pullman are a very winning couple - with a nice payoff that ties several motifs neatly together.

706424,5,6303637574,"I knew this film was great when my husband sat through the entire film with me and genuinely enjoyed it.

Lucy is a lonely young woman living in the big city with her pet cat.  For a living, she sits in a booth day after day and collects tolls.  One day, she sees a tall, dark handsome man (Peter) who seems to resemble her now dead father.  She falls in love with him but he's oblivious to her.

Because Lucy lives alone, her boss gets her to work Christmas Day.  Amazingly, the man of her dreams rushes by on the Holiday, drops some coins in her booth, and wishes her a merry Christmas.  It happened so fast that poor Lucy never even got the chance to speak to her would-be lover.  As fate would have it, though, he ends up getting mugged and is pushed onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train.  Lucy bolts from her booth and jumps onto the tracks.  As she lies on top of him, she rolls him and herself out of the path of the oncoming train, thus saving his life.

At the hospital, the personnel block her from going to him.  As they do, she stares through the glass doors at his prone form lying on a gurney and says, ""I'm going to marry him.""  A nearby nurse oversees what happens and hears what Lucy says.

When the family arrives, they rush into Peter's room anxious to see how he is doing.  Lucy is pointed out to them and they are told that she saved Peter's life.  And that's when the nurse tells everyone that Lucy is his fiance - and the fun begins.

There's much said about the predictability of this film.  Whether you feel it is predictable or not, it's handled in such a way that you're anxious to see the story unfold and to watch how everything turns out.  Sandra Bullock gives a terrific performance as the sweet, lonely, and lovable Lucy; Bill Pullman plays, Jack, Peter's brother.  A cast of great character actors make up Peter's family.  I honestly believe it's the combined performance of the stellar cast that make this film so memorable.

If you're thirsting for something wholesome, funny, and that doesn't get old with repeated viewings, then this is the movie for you!  You won't regret it!",1213833600,,2123,4.35969387755102

While waiting at the hospital to hear of his condition, she makes the statement that lying in there is the man she was going to marry.  A nurse overhears Lucy and assumes that she is Peter's fiance when in fact it was just Lucy's overactive imagination.  She intends to clear it up until his family barges in.  Lucy doesn't want to upset the family any more than they already are, so she keeps the truth to herself for the moment.  She is included in the family, and really made to feel a part of them, so then she can't bring herself to tell them the truth at all.

706650,5,6303637574,"`While You Were Sleeping' is one of those movies that reminds me how much I love movies.  No matter how sappy, how improbable and how sentimental this film really is it works so well because it tries hard enough.  It really excels in yanking those heart strings and endearing the audience to the characters involved.  `While You Were Sleeping' is the film that just about every romantic comedy dreams of becoming.  In fact Sandra Bullock is officially the queen of the romantic comedy (sure Meg Ryan is great, and I love her, but Bullock has this locked up) for when you tag this with her brilliant comedic work in `Two Weeks Notice' and you have two of the best romantic comedies ever filmed.

Sandra plays Lucy Eleanor Moderatz, a young toll booth clerk who has fallen madly in love with a business man who takes the train everyday.  Like most of the memorable characters played by Bullock, Lucy is out of luck when it comes to love and really life in general.  She wants to fall in love and travel the world but has never come close.  Then one day her luck changes in a very strange and unexpected way.  When this man, Peter, gets mugged right in front of her and pushed onto the train tracks Lucy ends up saving his life, and in a hospital mix-up she ends up being perceived as Peter's fianc&eacute;.  Peter is in a coma and unable to correct the misunderstanding and so immediately Lucy is welcomed into the Callaghan home with open arms as they await Peter's awakening.

There's just one problem, and that problem comes in the form of Peter's brother Jack who doesn't believe for one minute that Lucy is his brother's fianc&eacute;.  In fact he tries everything in his power to prove her wrong.  Lucy on the other hand, while hating the fact that she's lying to this wonderful family, can't help but enjoy the feeling she has now being part of a family.  She finally feels whole.  She has people to spend her holidays with, people who love her and care about her and she just can't get up the strength to give that up.  Jack poses another problem though as time progresses.  As Lucy and Jack continue to spend time together they begin to feel a little more strongly for each other then they would have expected and this poses problems all their own.

`While You Were Sleeping' sports an Oscar worthy performance by Bullock in my humble opinion (my personal Best Actress winner of the given year) as well as some impressive supporting performances as well.  Bill Pullman is usually `leave him or take him' in my book but here he actually does a great job, as does Peter Gallagher who is never really a highlight for me.  The true shining star comes in the form of Jack Warden though as Saul, the loving Grandfather who takes Lucy under his wing.  His performance is endearing and touching.  The late Peter Boyle is also great here.

So, while `While You Were Sleeping' may be a somewhat predictable comedy oozing forth with heaping globs of sentiment it hits its mark one-hundred percent and rises above it's competitors as the superior romantic comedy, the film they can all aspire to become, the film they all should look up to and the film that will make you love movies once again.",1190851200,7,3190,4.557894736842106

706772,3,6303637574,"This is a really good holiday film-just what you need for the Christmas season!

The film centers around a woman named Lucy(S. Bullock) who is completely alone for the holidays. Lucy is in love with Peter, but it is from afar- really far-they have never met. So, lonely Lucy has no love, no real friends, and works every holiday because she is the only Metro employee without a family. Fate takes a hand, however, and she ends up saving the life of her handsome stranger (Peter).  At the hospital, Peter's family then mistakes her for the man's fiancee, and miscommunications abound.  What could have been a really corny, screwball type comedy, is stopped by Bullock's portryal of Lucy. Lucy is so earnest that you do not question the idea that there was no way for her to clear up the misunderstanding with the stranger's family (who practically adopt her for the Christmas season). Lucy needed them and they needed her to bring them closer to their son, who had become estranged over the years.

Lucy, the lone soul who had no family of her own, simply could not pull herself away from the Callaghans, especially when they were sharing Christmas presents and dinner with her.

Sandra Bullock was unpretentious, sincere and adorable - a good influence for the elder son (Peter Gallagher), a sucessful career man who was not close to home. Jack Warden, Peter's godfather, saw her attributes and would not disclose her lies, especially when Peter was in a coma.

Things became hilarious when Peter woke up in a coma and Lucy still got away with it. How Lucy and Jack (Peter's younger brother) became good friends was also interesting. A good holiday movie.",1166140800,,879,4.9324324324324325

706829,4,6303637574,"Even though she showed a deft touch for racist vitriol in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", Sandra Bullock will forever be etched as the lovable girl-next-door from this winsome 1995 romantic comedy directed by Jon Turteltaub. In a vehicle that was written originally for Demi Moore by Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow, Bullock shines as Lucy Moderatz, a lonely token collector at a Chicago L-train station. The plot focuses almost completely on Lucy and how she becomes involved with not only Peter Callaghan, the object of her romantic fantasies, but his loving family as well. It all turns on a train platform incident where muggers have pushed Peter onto the tracks at which point Lucy saves him from an oncoming train.

The seemingly innocent deception begins when a hospital nurse assumes that Lucy is Peter's fiance. Since he is comatose and she is smitten with the man she thinks he is, the charade gets bigger as the Callaghans welcome her with open arms. However, the inevitable complications ensue when Peter's brother Jack enters the picture at first suspicious but then...well, you can figure out the rest. There are definitely some narrative lapses that make this film less than logical, for example, the Callaghan's somewhat blas attitude toward Peter's comatose state once they meet Lucy. Regardless, Turteltaub manages to make the lightweight film feel like a throwback to an earlier era of romantic comedies.

Bill Pullman makes a nice, casual leading man as Jack, and there is genuine chemistry between the two stars. The rest of the cast is sharp and funny, in particular, Peter Boyle as the Callaghan paterfamilias, a far warmer variation than his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" curmudgeon; Glynis Johns as the dotty grandmother, not that far removed from her maternal suffragette in ""Mary Poppins""; Michael Rispoli as Lucy's persistent suitor and wannabe cross-dresser, Joe Jr.; Jack Warden as understanding Uncle Saul; and Peter Gallagher nicely underplaying the less-than-ideal Peter. But it's Bullock's show, and no matter how many times she has recycled her persona on lesser comedies since then, it's her sincerity, self-deprecating manner and plain-faced beauty that makes this movie one of the better studio confections of the 1990's. The 1998 DVD has no extras.",1161388800,6,2278,5.204359673024523
706830,5,6303637574,"""While You Were Sleeping"" has become one of my very favorite movies, so easy to watch, or to relax and fall asleep to. So nice.  It has no violence.  It does have intelligent humor, and loving family relationships, and deep friendships, and understanding and acceptance.  And welcoming hearts.  It is happy and funny and romantic and touching, and not slow or tedious.  The actors in this film are absolutely perfect for

their roles, and their work is so good, so right-on, that, as you

watch it, THEY ARE those characters.  You will fall in love with

them, and you will probably want to see more of their lives, as

a family, and as friends.

Right now, this is my favorite Sandra Bullock film, and my favorite for Bill Pullman, too.  Darling, gentlemanly.  Loved him.

And, I was so happy to get to experience the wonderful work of such fine character actors as Glynis Johns, Jack Warden, Peter

Boyle, and Micole Mercurio.  They were all just outstanding.  And, of course, there was the handsome Peter Gallagher, and the amazing and gorgeous and funny Ally Walker.  I also loved Ally's starring work in another of my favorite movies, ""If You Believe"", which, I believe, was a Lifetime Movie Original.

There are also other characters who really add to the fun, and

actors whose work you will appreciate.

It's a cute, warm and funny story of Lucy (Sandra Bullock) who falls in love with a guy (Peter) she's never met before (played by The O.C's Peter Gallagher).  She saves him one day after he was pushed to the tracks in Chicago's El system.  When they won't let her in to see him because she isn't family, she mumbles to herself that she was going to marry that guy and a nurse overhears this and assumes she's the fiance.  Just before she can correct that faux pas, Peters family come to see him and she can't back out of it.  Now there is a facade to pull off but not before she falls in love with Peter's brother, Jack.  Oy vey.

But it is a quirk of humanity that we can all identify with when the Callahans jump to conclusions rather than hearing all Lucy is trying to tell them.  The plot is complicated by the well-meaning Saul who assures Lucy he will take care of the confusion.  He has his own agenda.

706887,3,6303637574,"Last Christmas, home nursing a broken arm, I started to rummage through the collection to find any unusual Christmas fare.  When I came across WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, I let out an ""Aha!""  I recalled that the bulk of that movie's action took place during the Christmas season--even though I also recalled that it was released to theaters in the spring.

Sometimes movies with farfetched premises benefit from being set in the holiday season.  It's a magical time for many of us, and we are sometimes more generous toward and believing of the fantastical elements in such tales.  (Even if they are released in May.)  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING has as gimmicky a premise as you could conceive of: Chicago working class girl (transit worker Sandra Bullock) worships yuppie lawyer from afar, saves  his life and gets mistaken for his fiancee by his loving, kooky and--as it turns out--equally working class family (since the yuppie lawyer, played[?] by Peter Gallagher is conveniently in a coma, he can't set the record straight).  But then, the working class gal meets and falls big for the lawyer's regular guy brother (Bill Pullman) and all kinds of complications and highjinks ensue.

It's all very ""high concept,"" in a way, except that if I read the definition of that film term correctly, ""high concept"" is one or two sentence summation used as a sales pitch when marketing a film to a producer.  And for the life of me, I can't really see summarizing WYWS's gimmick into two punchy sentences (the ones penned above, you'll note, are rife with subordinate clauses).  The flick's got an angle, obviously, but I'm glad it wasn't my job to market it.

Which is not to say that despite the film's rickety premise and obvious hokum, it's not enjoyable.  Many viewers just love this movie, and I've actually discovered that there are some folks in my circle who drag it out every holiday season along with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and WHITE CHRISTMAS.  (And I thought *I* was being so clever last Dec. 25!)  Bullock and Pullman are appealing actors and serve this vehicle very well.  The rest of the cast(which includes reliable character actors like Glynis Johns, Jack Albertson and Peter Boyle) is also fine, if sometimes a little manic.  As is the overall pacing.

Suspension of disbelief is key to appreciating this film's good qualities.  It did not occur to me the first time I watched this movie that if Chicago is anything at all like NYC (closer to my own stomping grounds), the story of a transit worker who rescued her fiance would have been all over the tabloids and the local broadcast news.  In other words, there would have been no way that her (actually inadvertent) little ruse would not have come to light within a day or so.  It certainly would not have just been a family affair as it is in the movie.

But it was Christmastime and a time for fairy tales and happy endings.  And maybe I subconsciously gave the film a few extra points for giving my own family name (spelled the old Irish way) to the warm, kooky family.  I even forgave the fact that like many movies of this genre, it actually alternated from being at times genuinely cute and endearing to sometimes being too cute by at least half.  The movie probably would not have gelled quite as well with other actors in the leads, but even though both Pullman and Bullock have taken on and pulled off more challenging roles in recent years, they are ideally cast here.

And that counts for something.",1142380800,3,3467,4.689256198347107

The nurse in turn tells the family and before Peter can wake from his coma he's got a new bride-to-be.

707012,5,6303637574,"One of the surprise films of 1995, While You Were Sleeping is one of the top romantic comedies of the decade. Sandra Bullock experiences her breakout role as the loveable lead character, and Bill Pullman makes a name for himself a year before the release of Independence Day (where he performed masterfully as the president). Overall, While You Were Sleeping is a classic feel-good love story with enough comedy and laughs to avoid earning the designation of a soppy chick flick.

Sandra Bullock plays the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz, a Chicago subway ticket-taker who whittles away the hours of her life trapped inside a ticket booth along the tracks. Each day, Peter Callaghan (Peter Gallagher) passes by in his daily commute to work. Lucy has managed to develop a crush on the man (whose name she doesn't even know), fantasizing about their life together, but she never says a word about it. When Christmas Eve arrives, she witnesses a gang of thugs beat up Peter and leave him on the tracks. Risking her own life, Lucy saves Peter from an oncoming train and summons medical help.

While in the hospital, she tells the nurse she's the man's fiance, and when Peter's family shows up at the hospital, the nurse relays the same information to them. Shocked that Peter had a fiance they knew nothing about, they nonetheless take Lucy under their wing. Afraid to reveal the truth, Lucy goes along with the lie while Peter remains in a coma. When Peter wakes up, he doesn't remember Lucy, and she continues the lie - telling him he suffers from amnesia. Meanwhile, Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman) comes to know Lucy intimately. He has his suspicions about her, but becomes attracted to her himself. When the truth comes out, Lucy will have to answer for her actions...

In While You Were Sleeping, a bona fide star is born in actress Sandra Bullock. Although her performance in Love Potion No. 9 is just as brilliant, the film itself didn't enjoy the commercial success necessary to propel her stardom. In While You Were Sleeping, Bullock gets the recognition she deserves. Her sweet, shy demeanor, coupled with a talent for slapstick comedy, makes her character quite relatable and easy to like. Bullock has a great feel for delivering her lines, and it's obvious in this picture.

With a classic 'character trapped in a lie' plotline, While You Were Sleeping relies upon the onscreen relationship between actress Sandra Bullock and actor Bill Pullman. The two pull it off well, and the audience takes an instant liking to all the characters involved. In the end, the viewer has to root for the two to get together, and when an audience becomes emotionally involved in the outcome of a film, then you've got a definite hit on your hands. While You Were Sleeping is one of those movies, and that's why it earns its designation as a must-see film...

707013,5,6303637574,"An outstanding romantic comedy, While You Were Sleeping, brings to the screen the story of a girl working at a Chicago Transit tollbooth who has a soft spot for a complete stranger who buys tickets from her every day, but that's as far as it goes.  When one day she saves his life and brings him to the hospital where he remains in a state of coma, his family thinks that that the two are engaged.  If that wasn't enough, she gradually falls for the man's brother with all the ups and downs that that entails!

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor (!!!), and the music are all wonderful!

707014,5,6303637574,"This movie is addictive; watch it once and like it, then again and like it some more.  By the 3rd, time, you'll LOVE IT!  The ensemble cast works perfectly.  You will relate to the quirky lead characters, the butt-in-ski relatives, the sweet and lovable super's son, even the stuck up former fiance who Jack proposed to.

Lucy, Jack and Peter are three people who come together by chance, have very little in common, and yet can learn volumes from one another while building their relationships.  I don't want to give too much away, the plot is not all that tricky, but you'll appreciate some subtle dialog along with facial expressions that will leave you howling (Lucy trying to get everyone's attention in the hospital the first time the family sees Peter recovering).

You will totally root for Lucy as she struggles between telling the truth to Peter and his family, falls for Jack, even keeps her dream alive of stamping her passport in Italy.  The music is lighthearted and pleasant throughout, and by the closing credits you'll either be crying with joy (admit it, it's sappy but touching) or smiling with acknowledgement that happy endings make a movie love story so darned great.

707015,4,6303637574,"This is one of the better movies of its genre.  Sandra Bullock plays a likable girl whose main desire in life is to get a stamp in her passport from a foreign country.  Having lost both parents, she lives with her cat in a small Chicago apartment with her cat and has to avoid the stereotypical Italian (a la Andrew Dice Clay) super's son's advances.

She works a a token booth clerk and fantasizes about a rich passenger that passes her booth daily.  One day he is pushed to the tracks by some teens and knocked unconscious.  Bullock jumps to the tracks and saves him and then goes with him to the hospital.  He is in a coma and when his family comes to visit, they mistakenly think that Bullock is his fiancee.

Bullock doesn't have the heart to tell them she isn't, especially because they are so nice and provide Bullock with the family affection that she is missing.  It gets real interesting when Bullock slowly starts falling for the coma man's brother.  Tension mounts knowing that wben the coma man wakes, Bullock will be exposed as a fake.

707016,4,6303637574,"This is one of my favorite romantic comedies. I think what it gets right is something others don't focus on. It is not enough to just have a great couple, but you have to create a world for them as well. The supportive roles are just as important as the leads.

I think most women like Sandra Bullock, because she beautiful, but not so beautiful that we cannot relate to her. She is smart and very funny. She is a good person who deserves love. I think it's great that there is this guy she idealizes and projects all of her romantic fantasies on to. Of course, if she ever talked to him that would end quickly.

She ends up being drawn into this kooky family, which is what she is really looking for...not just love, but a home. Bill Pullman is very attractive as a good down to earth guy who sees how wonderful she is. There are so many warm and wonderful moments in this movie.

I think the humor is the other thing it has going for it. Michael Rispoli is hilarious, as is Sandra. I think guys who are not that into romantic comedies may be able to deal with this one because of the humor.

My favorite scene is when she is pouring her heart out to the Peter Gallagher character in the hospital. The loneliness and sadness is something we have all felt at some point.

707017,5,6303637574,"The story is sweet and could have been sticky, and yet it is a deep, touching movie about loneliness, with a happy ending for many (Lucy, all the family). The casting deserves an Oscar, it is perfect. Though if I had been asked if I would chose Bill Pullmann, before I saw him, I would have said no, for I could not detect any sex appeal in him in Sleepless in Seattle. I know better now. He is a terrific actor, that is why I have not noticed before how attractive he is! He can play the clumsy niceguy and you cannot imagine you would like to be touched by him.  In While you were Sleeping, I developed a crush for him, he could touch me any time! The movie can be seen again and again, and never gets boring, instead one discovers little ""Schmankerl"" by listening better to the dialogs. One wants to sit among the family at the dinner table when they have this hilarious conversation, where both Jack and Lucy for the first time share the same sense of humour and enjoy it. Sharing the same sense of humor is most important for a lasting relationship/marriage. One wants to know more about what happened after he proposes in the toll booth, one wants to know how they lived after they married. The best scene? Not just one: definitely when they slipped on the ice, but also when Jack explains what leaning is and Joe jr. interrupts and asks ""is this guy bothering you? I know carate"", and when Joe jr. cried about Miss 3rd floor and Lucy invites him to try on her shoes again. This scene shows that the makers of this film had the true Christian spirit: understanding, caring, and accepting that loneliness has many faces, and how charitable it is to be tolerant and not condemming. Anyone saying this film is ""only"" a comedy? They ought to see the film again, for it is so much much more. Anyone saying this film is not realistic? Think again! Lucy was lonely, but brave, has a loving and kind heart, it is very realistic that she daydreams about one man, and truly falls in love with another. It is a fact that if you are romantic and admit it, romantic things will happen to you. Same holds true that if you do not believe in love, you most probably will never feel the breathlessness and the sparks.

707018,5,6303637574,"In this movie, Sandra Bullock (Speed) plays undoubtably the greatest role of her career. In this flick, she plays Lucy Eleanor Moderatz, a lonely train station token clerk that falls in love with an everyday commuter named Peter Callahan (Peter Gallagher - Malice). One day, Christmas Day while she is the only one at work Peter gets mugged while waiting for the train and gets pushed onto the train tracks falling into a coma. When she goes to the hospital to get in, she says to herself outloud, ""I was going to marry him."" Then a nurse overhears her, and tells the family that Lucy is the fiancee. An outrageous comedy begins.

At first, Lucy wants to tell them the truth before it gets out of hand. But it does. As things progress, she falls in love with Peter's hilarious family. She goes to Christmas Dinner at the Callahan house. Then she starts to fall in love with Peter's younger brother, Jack (Bill Pullman - Independence Day). Jack immediately is attracted to Lucy and is forced to hold in his feelings for her as he thinks that Lucy is really going to marry Peter. As Peter remains in his coma, Lucy and Jack start falling in love the more they spend time with each other.

Finally Peter wakes up, of course doesn't know who Lucy is but his family convinces him that she is his fiancee and he plays along with it and plans to marry her. Now it is time for Lucy to choose Peter or Jack. Who will it be?

Watch the movie and find out. This is one of the greatest romance comedies I have ever seen. Without a doubt, this truly is Sandra Bullock's greatest performance ever.",1097107200,,1583,4.43298969072165
707019,5,6303637574,"I have watched this movie a lot of times and thought I would finally review it. I'm happy to see other reviewers also feel the same way I do about this movie! This is one of the few movies that I repeatedly put into my dvd player for viewing. It is one of the best romantic comedy films ever made.

The story is about Lucy (Sandra Bullock), a lonely girl without family, who works in a tollbooth everyday with boredom. The only high point of her work is when she sees Peter Callahan, a man who walks by her booth everyday to catch the subway. She has not talked to him ever but hopes that one day that he too will fall in love with her. One day though, due to some circumstances, something happens to Peter and she saves Peter's life in the subway station and brings him to the hospital. Due to some misunderstandings, Peter's family think Lucy is his fianc&eacute;e and accept her as part of her family, where she gets to meet Jack (Bill Pullman). Soon Lucy finds herself in a sticky position and has to decide as to who she really loves in the end.

You will never get tired of watching this movie over and over again. When you watch this film, you will laugh, cry, and feel good about yourself. Sandra Bullock did a great job of playing Lucy. The chemistry between her and Bill Pullman is wonderful throughout the movie. Also, the background music to the movie is really great! Randy Edelman composed a sweet soundtrack for this movie that adds perfectly to all the scenes of the movie. `While you were sleeping' is a film you can watch with anyone, whether it be your friends or your family, and everyone enjoys it!",1094947200,2,1619,4.3754152823920265
707020,5,6303637574,"For her work after ""Speed"" my brother began referring to Sandra Bullock as ""Queen of the Chick Flicks"", and I won't disagree, although some of her films work much better for members of both sexes than others. ""While You Were Sleeping"" is an entertaining film for Guys and Dolls, and it works in repeated viewings.

Sandra portrays Lucy Moderatz, who takes tolls on the L train in Chicago and from afar has an obsessive crush on the handsome, well-dressed Peter Callaghan, played by Peter Gallagher. The audience must willingly accept that someone as likable and attractive as Sandra Bullock is stuck in a dead-end job where she is lonely and works all the holidays because, after all, she doesn't have anyone to share them with.  The movie doesn't give you much time to dwell on this because before you know it, Peter is getting mugged and knocked off Lucy's train station platform where he falls unconscious onto the path of a rapidly approaching train.  Not surprisingly, Lucy jumps down and pulls the man of her dreams to safety.  Lucy then follows the comatose Peter to the hospital where a nurse overhears Lucy in one of her daydreams say ""this is the man I'm going to marry"" - which naturally leads the nurse to think that Lucy and Peter are engaged when, in fact, the only words that have passed between them are when Peter paused to say ""Merry Christmas"" as he dropped his token into Lucy's toll booth.

Peter's wonderful family arrives and the misunderstanding of Lucy as Peter's fiancee is perpetuated.  Lucy could have cleared up the whole misunderstanding from the first moments but:
1. Peter's family is wonderful and Lucy is lonely.
2. Peter's grandmother has a ""heart condition"" and Lucy fears that telling the truth may send Grandma over the edge. (The screenwriters were clearly searching for a reason for Lucy to not just fess up....)
3. Since Lucy has been fantasizing about Peter for awhile it's not that difficult for her to pretend to be his fiancee.

I've heard Roger Ebert say it's not as important *what* a movie is about as *how* the movie is about that thing.

This movie would be doomed to failure if it were only about some pathetic toll-taker who pretends to be engaged to her dream-boat to his family while he's in a coma.  But Lucy isn't pathetic - she's as likable and attractive as, well, Sandra Bullock, and Peter's family is full of charming, likable folks.  Peter, as things would have it, isn't as charming as Lucy dreamt.  Although he used to be in the family business of antique furniture, he went to law school and now barely keeps in touch with his family.  He has a bitchy girlfriend who is in Europe leaving calls on his answering machine while he is in a coma - one of the calls tells him ""yes, I'll marry you"".

Again - it's not difficult to guess where much of this is going.  Bill Pullman plays Peter's charming, easy-going brother, Jack, who has stayed close to the family, running Dad's business.  (There is an extremely well-done low-key scene close to the end where Jack tells Dad, played by Peter Boyle, that he wants to MAKE furniture instead of just dealing it - which will mean getting out of the family business.  The scene has both a ring of authenticity, not yielding to any histrionic cliches, and at the same time maintaining the warm feelings that you've built up for both of these characters by this portion of the movie.  These kinds of scenes *make* this movie.)

Jack Warden gets special kudos from me as Peter's godfather, Saul, who loves his godson, but also comes to love Lucy as well. Michael Rispoli steals a few scenes as ""Joe, Jr."" the son of Lucy's landlord.  In the early scenes Joe comes across as a shorter, heavier Andrew Dice Clay wannabe.  But by the end even Joe has become someone deserving our admiration. This is the kind of movie where you want nice things to happen to the characters - and the movie goes about it's business in a very satisfying way.",1093910400,151,3936,4.627873563218391

If you enjoy the occasional romantic chick flick, if you're in the mood to watch something upbeat that's not too deep, and if you think Sandra Bullock is just fine, thank you very much, then this is the movie for you.
While You Were Sleeping was Bullock's first starring role after her blockbuster success in Speed, and it does a good job of showcasing her wide appeal to viewing audiences. She captures our support, trust, and interest from the very beginning, playing a Chicago tollbooth ticket-taker who has a `thing' for a commuter guy she sees go thru her turnstile daily. Then he's mugged, she saves him, and somehow allows her family to believe that she's his fiance - and then, the plot thickens. At the bedside of this unconscious guy, she meets his brother - and she falls even harder for him.

You can discern her character from ""Speed"" in this movie, albeit a more relaxed version of that character.  It's Sandra's charm that will entrance a viewer and give you a warm and fuzzy feeling by the end of the movie.
Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) is alone and lonely, aggravated by her job as a token taker for the Chicago Transit system.  Her father passed away the previous year, she has no close friends, and her mother passed away many years earlier.  Each morning a handsome and somewhat debonair man stops by her window.  Lucy is in love with him in her mind, but he never talks to her, and it is not likely that he will.
On another lonely Christmas Day Lucy is stuck working while all her co-workers are at home with their families.  The debonair gentleman comes to her window and wishes her a Merry Christmas, and suddenly Lucy finds herself at a total loss for words.  As Lucy is berating herself for her sudden lack of verbal skill, the handsome man is accosted by two thugs who attempt to rob him.  In the course of the robbery, the man is shoved onto the railroad tracks, where a train is imminent.
Lucy rushes out of her cage as the thugs run away, jumps down onto the tracks, and pulls the man off the rails just as a train rushes over the spot where he was lying but moments before.  Concerned for the man's welfare, Lucy follows him to the hospital, where a nurse overhears Lucy muttering to herself, and believes Lucy to be the man's fianc&eacute;.  Suddenly Lucy is in the middle of a big, friendly family.  The handsome man is Peter Callaghan, played by Peter Gallagher, an attorney.
Lucy loves being part of the family, and they quickly grow to love her.  However, Lucy soon meets Jack Callaghan, Peter's brother, played by Bill Pullman, and Lucy grows to love Bill.  Of course, we know that eventually Peter must wake up, and Lucy must be found out.  The events that take us from the accident to the end of the movie are sometimes predictable, but Sandra and Bill carry the movie with their natural and mellow relationship.
While Sandra and Bill are the main characters, there are quite a few other actors that add spice to this movie, most particularly Jack Warden, but also Peter Boyle, Glynis Johns, and Michael Rispoli as Lucy's landlord's son Joe Fusco, Jr., aka Joey, Jr.  Michael provides an bizarre contrast as Lucy discovers him in her closet trying on a pair of her shoes, and Lucy makes mention of 900 numbers drawing a response of ""How did you find out about that"" from Joey, Jr.
This movie is light romantic comedy.  There are a few moments of outright hilarity reminiscent of the much more dysfunctional family in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.""  Most of the humor is more laid back and feel good.  By the end of the movie you want to hug Sandra Bullock (actually, throughout most of the movie too) and tell her everything is going to be all right.
This feel-good movie is perfect for Christmas and winter, and for those who want to believe in fairy tales and that good things happen to good people.",1057881600,2,3155,4.534391534391534

Lucy longs to be a part of family so badly. Then one day her dream comes true. Lucy works in a token booth at the Chicago subway, and everyday a handsome man named Peter comes through her booth.

My husband is getting a little tired of it, but there are nights when I tell him, ""It's either this or 'Babe'!"" From the opening scene, there is something sweetly philosophical about this movie, and Sandra Bullock has never been more appealing as a funny, klutzy girl who never makes it out of Chicago. (Of course, Sandra Bullock playing a woman who is frumpy is stretching credibility a bit.) And if any woman can keep from melting when Bill Pullman focuses that sweet, intense gaze, I've yet to meet her.
The vulnerability of the main characters gets you pulling for them right from the start, and the secondary characters do a wonderful job of convincing you that they are real with their own histories.
Peter Boyle is hysterical as the decent, but frustrated, father of Bill Pullman. And Peter Gallegher does a star turn as a handsome, spoiled ""putz,"" as one of the characters calls him. Glynis Johns is laugh-out-loud funny as the sweetly confused grandmother.
All in all, this is a movie that is well worth watching over and over again, especially when you need a little reminder that love is waiting out there for us all.",1050624000,64,1241,4.619909502262443
707272,4,6303637574,"After hitting the big time alongside Keanu Reeves *drool* in Speed in 1994, according to supposed ""film critics"", Sandra Bullock did a lot of not very good films, before coming back with Miss Congeniality. Hope Floats, In Love & War, and this one - While You Were Sleeping. Personally, I like any Sandra Bullock film. She can breathe life into any dull character, with her own quirky sense of humour. And if you've seen my ""About Me"" page - I wanna be just like her! But that's never gonna happen. She gets all the great leading guys - Keanu Reeves, Chris O'Donnell, Benjamin Bratt, Bill Pullman, Sylvester Stallone, Hugh Grant? OK, the last 3 depend on your tastes really. I've had this film on video for quite a while, but when I taped it off the TV, what happened? My tape ran out. So I never knew who she married or what happened. Then when I saw it to buy on DVD, I jumped at the chance. The ending ... frankly could have been better. That always happens doesn't it? You wait so long to see an ending of a film, and then it totally disappoints you. It was a good film though, although the family members could have been fleshed out a bit. And lucky Peter Gallagher or whatever his name is, got paid to lie in a coma for most of the film! This film is great if you're a romantic mood, or you're sad. It's a feel good film. Not good if you're watching it with a guy I don't think, they'll be moaning about how rubbish it is - what guys want is lots of guns and fighting. Right?

The fact that she has such big dreams adds a touch of childlike innocence, but later on in the movie, she makes a big decision that would change the course of events and show that she also has courage. If Bullock was enchanting in the film, Bill Pullman, playing Jack Callaghan, was equally mesmerizing. Pullman's little smiles and intense looks are enough to make just about any girl weak in the knees. Add that to his vulnerability when he fell in love with Lucy, and you get the perfect romantic comedy. This movie never fails to cheer me up and put me in a romantic mood.

707377,5,6303637574,"A sweet and gentle, romantic film about how love sometimes slips in through the window rather than coming straight in through the front door, it's the one that put star Sandra Bullock into contention with Meg Ryan for the crown of America's Sweetheart.  And with good reason, because in ""While You Were Sleeping,"" directed by Jon Turteltaub, Bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day ""girl next door,"" in the best and most sincere sense.  This is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition, the need to love and be loved, and makes no bones about what it's trying to accomplish along the way.  Clearly, the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time.  And they succeed on both fronts.
Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) lives alone in Chicago, where she has an apartment, a cat and a job with the CTA as a token taker for the train.  Her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful (read:  Dull), and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth.  She's doesn't even know his name, and they've never exchanged so much as a ""Good morning,"" but in her mind he's become the Prince Charming she's always dreamed about.
Then on Christmas morning he passes through, but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks, unconscious.  And a train is coming.  Lucy runs to his aid and saves his life, but the severe head trauma he's sustained has put him in a coma.  At the hospital, they refuse to let her in to see him, as that is a privilege reserved for family members only; so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee, which does the trick.  But when his family-- his rather ""large"" family-- shows up, her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket.  Everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that Lucy simply can't get in a word of explanation.  The next thing she knows, to the family she is their beloved Peter's (Peter Gallagher) intended (even though he's never said a word to them about her), and because the situation is so frantic and there's such concern about Peter, besides which it's Christmas, Lucy can't bring herself to tell them the truth.  So in an instant, her life is suddenly changed; she's surrounded by ""family,"" and she's ""engaged"" to her Prince Charming.  Even if he is, well...in a coma.
Turteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of Nora Ephron's ""You've Got Mail"" (the second best romantic comedy ever made) and ""Sleepless In Seattle.""  He sets a perfect pace, and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way-- he makes you feel at home with them.  Most importantly, though, Turteltaub manages to make this a ""sweet"" film without being ""saccharin"" about it, which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow.  Instead, he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely Ephronesque and entertaining, and it works beautifully.  The humor is warm, and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of ""need"" that is universal, then triumphs by satisfying that need in the end.
Sandra Bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here; there's a special quality about her Lucy that makes you want to reach out to her.  She is, without question, the most vulnerable character Bullock has ever played.  There is very little of Annie (""Speed"") or Gracie (""Miss Congeniality""), for example, about her; the closest to Lucy of any of her characters, in fact, would be Birdee in ""Hope Floats.""  That is not to say there is anything ""weak"" about Lucy at all-- quite the contrary, in fact.  There is a decided strength in the very benevolence of Lucy's nature, even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs.  This is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life, but keeps an open mind and, above all, an open heart.  And that is what makes Lucy so endearing; she's the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her co-workers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better.  That's what Bullock brings to her performance here, and it's what makes Lucy one of her most enduring and memorable characters.
As for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door, that's exactly what Bill Pullman does with his portrayal of Peter's brother, Jack Callaghan.  He's the one who shows up after the fact, as it were, but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience.  Initially, Jack seems to be playing the role of devil's advocate, his suspicions aroused by the fact that Peter has never mentioned Lucy to him; but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective.  And Pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time, which makes Jack convincing, and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly.  A ""character actor"" type leading man, Pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters, but Jack is his most engaging role ever, and he succeeds entirely with it.
The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.  Warm and poignant, ""While You Were Sleeping"" is one to savor; this one's a keeper.  (BTW, the #1 romantic comedy?  Bonnie Hunt's ""Return To Me"").",1031443200,3,5700,4.690763052208835
707378,4,6303637574,"There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of substance to this film, but it's more than it seems.  It works because of a wonderful combination of romance and comedy, neither taking itself too seriously.
Sandra Bullock plays Lucy with that trademark combination of sass and sweet. She's got something all of us can relate to at one point - she's a little klutzy, a little tired, a little dreamy, and a little sad. Still, it's far from bleak - she's got her kitty, a home and a job, not to mention a healthy sense of humor. She even has a semi-real Mr. Right.
Then Mr. Right falls off a subway platform. Oops. It's Lucy to the rescue! At the hospital she meets his eccentric family, the Callaghans, and then it gets complicated when they mistake her for his fiance.  Taken to their hearts from Grandma Elsie to brother Jack, Lucy finally has the family she's always craved and she can't disillusion them with the truth as long as their son is in his coma. For the solitary Lucy, life gets very, very full.
It's a little predictable, but the end is a bit of a surprise. For a fluffy movie, it handles things with a dash of wry maturity. The setting is Chicago and winter, so it's a perfect holiday season movie that will get you in the mood for winter cheer. This is a comedy that doesn't go for laughs, but simply shows us the way life is often funny and sweet.  Perhaps it doesn't quite make the most of the actors or plot, but those are easily overlooked.

As a matter of fact, everytime I view this film it never fails me to shed a tear. There are many funny scenes and dialogues in this Bullock film but those who watch this may also agree that there are also
a many sad scenes and feelings in this film. For instance, Sandra
as Lucy all by herself in an apartment with a cat as her companion and her conversation with Peter Gallagher while he's still in coma. Gone are the days for me when I watch a film due to visuals, now I really listen to the dialogue even if the film's script isn't award winning. I believe that's how I get the
substance of the film. Though this film isn't perfect, it's near
perfect. From the first rate stars down to the overall mood of the film. And one of the things I like in the film is its season:
Christmas. Personally,this season brought sad memories for me so it isn't hard to relate to Lucy's situation. I think everyone can
very well relate to Lucy or anybody's character like longing for

707458,3,6303637574,"Although trading as an amiably casual romantic comedy, 'While You Were Sleeping ' is in actual fact a Horror Film.  And the Fear is its central protagonist, Lucy.  Cut off from the Family, unpoliced by her father, she is a single woman with an unlimited, socially disruptive potential for promiscuity, to the point where every man in the film, young or old, rich or poor, can be plausibly linked to her as a partner.  The film's movement is to rein this potential wild card in, bring her back to the Family, to a site where privacy is given up in exchange for comfort, where one is constantly being looked at by others.  In such a scenario, Peter the coma-guy is not so much her ideal better half as her bad double - he IS promiscuous, he lives his life away from the family.
This gives a dark edge to what is a film smirking like a Nora Ephron clone, especially if we switch the film's focus from its apparent heroine onto Bill Pullman's Jack (which I would advise those with sensitive stomachs to do, those immune to Ms. Bullock's 'charms').  He is a kind of detective-spy, investigating Lucy to ensure that she is family-worthy and controllable.  This is not to say that there aren't tensions - Jack wants to leave his dad's business; but there is no question of him leaving the family circle, which simply absorbs outsider-goodness, in the shapes of Lucy and godfather Saul.  Indeed, fathers and their children is a major sub-theme, with Lucy looking for someone to replace her idealised dad.
To be honest, 'Sleeping' is only truly enjoyable whenever the wonderful Peter Gallagher is on screen, his breezing egotism a breath of fresh air in an atmosphere dank with goodwill.  But if this film plays Peter's dream - and it IS HE who is sleeping - and all the characters are reflections of HIS ego, than the film opens up far more interesting possibilities.",1010793600,3,1859,4.62917933130699

While You Were Sleeping can hold its own with any of the classics of the past.  It not only takes great writing to make a great romantic comedy, it takes great casting.  Fortunately, the stars of While You Were Sleeping fit their roles perfectly.  I don't know how Bill Pullman affects the ladies, but I fell in love with Sandra Bullock within the first five minutes of the movie.  Like most of the other reviewers, I have watched the movie many times and enjoyed it each time.  If you have any romance in your soul, you will love this movie, too.",996451200,,685,4.388888888888889

Sandra Bullock is perfect as the adorable and confused Lucy, caught up with the dysfunctional family and Bill Pullman is great as the brother who is clearly right for her. The rest of the cast do a great job. If you don't like romantic comedies stay clear as this is as sacharrine as they come.

  Sandra Bullock plays Lucy, a Chicago transit tollbooth clerk who lusts after a businessman Peter(Peter Gallagher)whom she sees everyday on his way to work.  One day, he falls into the train tracks and she saves his life, but it sends him into a coma.  Lucy accompanies Peter to the hospital and in order to be able to see him, she gets stuck saying that she is his fiancee.  This gets her into trouble as she meets the rest of his family who are all very loveable people.  Lucy also meets Peter's brother, and they develop strong feelings for each other, but Peter wakes up with amnesia.  This was a romantic movie with a great blend of sweet scenes and beautiful comedy as Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman have great chemistry together.  Also, Peter is perfect as the beautiful man that people lust for.  That is until you get to know him.

707616,5,6303637574,"This is a great date movie.  Even if the date is merely watching it at home with your spouse.  Lonely transit clerk Lucy (Sandra Bullock) saves Peter Callaghan's life.  While he languishes in a coma, Peter's family mistakes Lucy for his fiancee.  It's true Lucy is attracted to Peter (Peter Callagher) from afar, but she can't bring herself to tell the Callaghans the truth that she and Peter are not engaged.  In fact, they are virtual strangers.  The Callaghans are the tightly knit family Lucy misses, and that makes her more reluctant to set the record straight.  When they invite her over to celebrate Christmas with them, Lucy is hooked.  She meets Peter's brother, Jack (Bill Pullman), and an attraction develops.

This may all sound as typical romantic comedy fluff, but ""comedy"" is the key word.  Sandra Bullock's flair for light comedy is amply demonstrated in this film.  She shines as a blue collar Audrey Hepburn.  In addition, there is an outstanding supporting cast that keeps the laughs coming fast and frequent.  Especially good is Jack Warden as Saul and his repartee with Glynis Johns, the impish grandmother.  Michael Rispoli as Joe Fusco, Jr. is hilariously boorish.  The film blends clever dialogue, romance, and warm fuzzy moments.  To the male viewers out there (recoiling in horror about now), stay with it, guys.  Enjoy the laughs and Sandra Bullock's sparkle.  Multiple viewing only enhances the rewards.  ;-)",980294400,7,1436,5.008474576271187

I never realized before what a perfect holiday movie it is! Of course, it's funny and romantic, and Sandra Bullock is perfect in her role as the lonely toll booth worker (though she may be just a tad too beautiful to be entirely believable as a single woman) and Bill Pullman-funny, smart, boyishly handsome Bill Pullman-finally gets the girl in a film.
But the movie also makes one realize the importance of family and people to love and be loved by, especially around those Major Holidays when we're usually too stressed out with gift-buying and feast-cooking to notice the really important thing-people. Watch this film some cold winter day, either alone or with loved ones, and you'll realize the same thing, along with being warmed from the inside out.",977875200,14,899,4.8441558441558445

The  romance between Sandra Bullock---in her finest role---and Bill  Pullman---one of his finest roles---could warm the bleakest, coldest, and  most unforgiving Midwest winter and thaw the thickest Lake Michigan ice  cap.

707622,5,6303637574,"Forget all the rest, ""While You Were Sleeping"" is the best romantic comedy to come out of Hollywood in the past decade.  Every moment of this sweetly endearing story will leave you with a warm and tingly  feeling all over that won't wear off until long after the movie ends. In  her first starring vehicle, an extremely appealing Sandra Bullock plays  lonely subway worker Lucy and brings a warmth, freshness, and vulnerability  to this character that everyone can identify with.  After all, we've all  had unrequited crushes on someone else at one point in our lives, but when  Lucy saves the life of her ""dream man"" Peter, a hilarious comedy  of errors ensues at the hospital when she is mistaken for his fiancee and  passed off to his family as such. In the beginning, Lucy reluctantly plays  along with the ruse, but as she falls in love with Peter's family and  especially his brother Jack, she finds it very difficult to tell them the  truth - that she is not engaged to Peter, indeed she has never even spoken  to him!  Bullock and Pullman shine as the two romantic leads who are loath  to admit how attracted they are to each other, and the marvellous  supporting cast add many laughs to this gem of a movie.  This is a very  entertaining way to spend over ninety minutes.  You would have to be very  hard to please if you didn't enjoy this movie about love at second sight.

He goes into a coma, and lo and behold, Bullock's character is so  desperate she'll pretend to be the wife of a corpse(is there subliminal  necrophiliac undertones hidden between the lines of the thin excuse for a  script . . . even the worst TOM CLANCY'S NET FORCE spin-off novel has more  shreds of intelligence) while his brother tries it on.

Everytime I see it again, I simply  laugh..  And everytime I see the bit where she is telling the truth I cry..  This is the most amazing movie I have ever seen.

From then on,  circumstances (often comical) happen that means Bullock has to go along  with the ruse. Then she meets her 'ideal' man's brother and falls in love  with him.
Bullock's character is lovely and you really feel for her  when she explains always she carries her passport around with her because  she's going to Italy someday.
Bill Pullman as the brother she falls for  is also very good.  You can almost see the internal struggle he's fighting  not to show that he has feelings for his brother's 'girl'.  One of the best  moments is when he plays cards with his comatose brother and says that the  highest card gets Bullock - when it goes against him he then decides it's  best of three, very sweet!
