8497687,3,B006GL8N9C,"The Midnight Horror Collection Vol. 4 features four legitimate TV horror films and four amateur student flicks. I admit that I bought this cheap collection just to have ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" on DVD.

The four legitimate films are on the first disk:

RAGING SHARKS (2005, 94 minutes): This is a shark flick mixed with submarine-thriller antics and a side of aliens. It's similar to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Octopus/dp/B00004YS59/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Octopus</a>"" but not as good. This aint your typical Jaws-copy shark flick; the plots way more ambitious. In fact, theres well over two hours of material here crammed into an hour and a half. The production quality is akin to the usual Syfy fare but with a lot of cussing, which shows that it was released to video rather than TV. The creators mustve been targeting 12-14 year-old boys because theres zero character development or suspense build-up. Something exciting happens every couple minutes, whether a shark attack, an explosion, a compartment flooded, someone getting knifed, shot, drowned, etc. Despite the continuous thrilling events to appease those with ADHD the first hour is relatively boring with zero artistic tact. Imagine if Conan the Barbarian knew how to play guitar and crudely tried to play the moving classic Stairway to Heaven. Thats a good description of this movie as it freely borrows from several sci-fi and shark films to barbarically fashion its own adolescent action flick. Thankfully, the last act finally delivers some genuine excitement and suspense, which is the main reason my grade is as high as it is. Plus Elise Muller as Vera is showcased effectively in a couple of scenes, but they couldve done a lot better considering the female resources at their disposal. So, this is a bad movie, but the final act is impressively kinetic and entertaining, as far as action-oriented sci-fi goes. Too bad its such a challenge to make it that far. GRADE: C

KRACKEN: TENTACLES OF THE DEEP(2006, 87 minutes):  While the BC locations are great and the squid looks pretty good for low-budget CGI, the acting of the protagonists is too flat and the villain is overly cartoony. Fitness model Victoria Pratt comes off as a more buff Kate Hudson, but doesn't do much for me. Michal Yannai as Sally is equally blas. The stunning Nicole McKay is on hand as the heavy's babe for all of 20 seconds. I realize a lot of work went into making this movie and it's worthwhile if you favor Pratt, Charlie O'Connell or sea monster flicks, but it's just overall too prosaic. GRADE: C-

NIGHT SHADOW (1989, 91 minutes): Kato Kaelin co-stars in this werewolf film about a journalist who comes back to her hometown where a series of grisly murders are occurring. This is akin to a modern Syfy creature feature, but with a production quality a notch below that prosaic level. The serviceable score, for instance, sounds like it was performed entirely on a Casio keyboard (and no doubt it was). Theres also too much marking time. Still, the cast is likable, the small town setting is quaint and the monster is pretty effective for a man in a suit, but you have to wait till the final act to see him. Lance is a more-than-agreeable protagonist, but the film drops the ball in the female department, as far as taking advantage of the resources (and Im not tawkin bout nudity or sleaze). But theres a lot of martial arts action due to the presence of Quan; and the late 80s ambiance is to die for (take, for instance, Quans absurd bra-like billie shirt and Katos hideous mullet). GRADE: C

HOWLING IV: THE ORIGINAL NIGHTMARE (1988, 94 minutes)j: This third sequel in the werewolf series was the first decent one (although the first sequel - ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howling-II-Your-Sister-Is-a-Werewolf/dp/B000A7LR9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howling II - Your Sister Is a Werewolf</a>"" - was so bad it's good). Anyway, this is supposed to be a more faithful rendition of the novel than the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Special-Edition/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling (Special Edition)</a>"", albeit with a much lower budget. It was shot in South Africa as a stand-in for S. California and stars Romy Windsor and Michael T. Weiss in a mullet (one of the few actors who could get away with it). This is a decent werewolf mystery tale with good characters and an interesting build-up, but a rushed, dissatisfying climax. Unlike the classic ""The Howling"" (1981), werewolves are scarce, but it's superior to ""Howling II"" (1985) and ""Howling III"" (1987) in that it throws out Phillippe Mora's goofy camp and general eccentricities. There's some quality full moon ambiance as well and Windsor & Severeid make for an effective female team. While the bulk of the movie was shot in the sticks of South Africa, and you can tell, it's not THAT bad of a substitute for the desert wilderness of Southern Cal. Actually, it makes for an interesting change of pace for the barely-connected series of stand-alone werewolf flicks. GRADE: B-

===============================================================================================

The four films on the other disk are decidedly amateurish. As mediocre as some of the four films above are, they're works of cinematic greatness compared to the four on this disk. These are non-legit, no-budget student films, nothing more, and should never have been released in the same company as legitimate TV films. Consequently, they're not worth the effort to provide technical details or grading. At best, they're extras.

The four non-films are:

BLOODLOCK. A vampire is locked in the basement of a house where the three new residents deal with a love triangle. Shot in Youngstown, OH, this is the best of the four, but that's not saying it's any good.

VAMPEGEDDON. Raunchy exploitation trash about vampires in the desert, including a lesbo vamp. If your dark side thinks that makes it worth seeing, think again. The only positives are a couple of good-looking girls (the barely-seen redhead and the pig-tailed blond) and a great underground metal soundtrack. Seriously, some outstanding obscure metal tracks are featured throughout. At least they did something right.

BLOOD RED MOON. A ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001T5D6LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>"" wannabe with a spare-change budget.

THE LAST VAMPIRE ON EARTH. Ditto, but with even less budget. That said, the theological ideas conveyed are interesting (Christians meet in a traditional church building while seemingly advocating JW theology) and the ""Bella"" character has an interesting secret. Regardless, this is decidedly high-school league.

Although the flicks on this second disk aren't professional films I sometimes find it interesting to watch amateur zero-budget films, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodthirst-2-Revenge-of-the-Chupacabras/dp/B000H0MN7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodthirst 2: Revenge of the Chupacabras</a>"" (even though ""Bloodthirst 2"" is actually a few notches BETTER in the production department, if you can believe that).",1339804800,,7305,5.551662174303684
8497688,2,B006GL8N9C,"Before I get too critical here, let me just say that I consider myself a fan of these low-budget horror collections released by Echo Bridge, and make a point to dig through every five dollar bin I come across to make sure I haven't missed any and that my collection is up to date. I can't believe I just admitted that publicly, but there it is, lol. Point being, I went into this knowing more or less what to expect, but even by the usual standards still came out somewhat disappointed.

Typically there's a balanced mix of films on each set, ranging from the ""just okay"" to the painfully unwatchable; every now and then you come across one you might even call ""good."" Either way there's a certain entertainment value in the cheesy charm of it all, and for the price, it's usually worth the risk. However, Volume 4 here really missed the mark, in my opinion, presenting us with a collection of films that venture way beyond low-budget and into spare change territory. The worst offender, by far, is Vampegeddon. I won't even attempt to describe the plot to you, because in all honesty I'm not sure there was one, and it just generally felt like a bunch of drama club students running around in the silliest makeup I've ever seen. (And, I hate to judge people this way because I'm no Brad Pitt myself, but if you insist on being naked for half the movie perhaps think about hitting the gym first.) The Last Vampire on Earth was awful on every level as well, but the main problem was the unprofessional acting and the fact that the actors would stumble over lines, make a face and gather their composure, then re-start the dialogue again from the beginning. It was literally like watching an 80-minute blooper reel and I'm surprised they let this one see the light of day at all. Raging Sharks seemed a bit more promising at first, because the scenes that involved sharks were actually fairly passable, but unfortunately the other 80% of the film was bogged down with lengthy exchanges of tedious dialogue set in drab submarine interiors. By the end of it I was in desperate need of a nap. Kracken didn't leave much of an impression on me one way or the other, and the picture/mastering on Night Shadow was so poor I simply couldn't see enough of what was supposed to be going on to form an opinion about it.

That's not to say the entire set was unbearable; I thought there was some genuine suspense throughout The Howling IV, and Bloodlock scores some points for makeup and gore, including a well-executed decapitation. Blood Red Moon bears more than a little resemblance to Twilight, what with its wide panning shots of green forests, enormous trees and overcast skies, right down to the font of the text in the credits, but despite all that I really liked the young lead actress and her character reminded me a lot of Darlene from Roseanne, so it held my attention overall. (Don't worry, nobody sparkles.) I guess in the end this DVD set is about on par with others in the Midnight Horror line; I think it's just because, in this particular case, the bad movies are SO bad that it sort of skews my rating and makes the whole thing come off worse than it really is, though there are still a couple movies here worth watching once. Bottom line, if you're new to the world of Echo Bridge, I wouldn't start here, but if you're already in too deep to turn back, lol, it's worth getting a hold of just for the sake of filling in the gaps in your collection.",1336003200,3,3453,4.505582137161085
