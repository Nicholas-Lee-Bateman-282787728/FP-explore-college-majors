8278617,5,B001AQBKSY,"I've been enamored of fighter planes since boyhood, and this is one of the best videos I have ever watched about fighter dogfights.

8278618,4,B001AQBKSY,"""Dogfights: The Greatest Air Battles"" serves as an excellent introduction to dogfighting tactics (or in contemporary military-speak ""Air Combat Maneuvering"") starting with a good summary of the ""Dicta Boelcke"" from World War One when the average life span of a new fighter pilot was a mere three weeks, to post-Vietnam jet combat where the technological threats are infinitely more sophisticated, but the employment of the aircraft still comes down to doctrines written years earlier by men like Oswald Boelcke and ""Boots"" Blesse.

The episode interviews many famous fighter pilots, aviators, and historians, including Willie Driscoll, Steve Ritchie, Robin Olds, Frederick ""Boots"" Blesse, Bud Anderson, and the now disgraced Randy Cunningham. All these men have interesting insights into the subject matter. I particularly appreciated Olds' views on the military leadership during the Vietnam era, and couldn't agree with him more. He noted that experts predicted the demise of dogfighting, and refused to put a gun on the new F-4, to the great consternation of the pilots. In Olds' view these ""experts"" were Generals who were promoted beyond their capabilities and usefulness, and who had no or very limited combat experience. Olds was, of course, proved right when the USAF and USN kill ratio started to fall precipitously during Vietnam due to lack of basic ACM skills and lack of a gun. (Eventually the USAF realized their error, and installed a 20mm cannon in the F-4E and all subsequent fighters.) The evolution of USN's ""Top Gun"" (Cunningham and Driscoll were early graduates) and the USAF Fighter Weapons School (Steve Ritchie was an early graduate and instructor) are discussed at some length as being crucial for providing US fighter pilots with the crucial real-world experiences that has helped them dominate the sky since Vietnam.

The episode profiles four famous dogfights from four different eras, and illustrates them quite well with computer graphics and vintage footage. The first dogfight profiled is Eddie Rickenbacker's famous one v. seven World War One dogfight where his lone Spad took on five German Fokker D.VII fighters and two armed reconnaissance planes in a mission that won him the Medal of Honor. The second profiled was from World War Two and profiled Bud Anderson's four v. four (P-51 against Bf 109) melee which epitomizes the crucible of fighter combat. Anderson's own views are a wonderful contribution to the documentary. The third dogfight is from the Korean War, and pits ""Boots"" Blesse against MiG-15s in a dogfight that put technical failures, inexperienced wingman problems, fuel exhaustion, and ultimately an ejection into shark-infested waters front and center. After discussing the incorrect prediction of the death of dogfighting (""everything will be missiles in the future..."") and a basic introduction to Infrared (AIM-9 Sidewinder) and Radar (AIM-7 Sparrow) missiles, appropriately commented on by Olds, the DVD proceeds to the last dogfight of the disc, Randy Cunningham and Willie Driscoll in a USN F-4, ""Showtime 100,"" versus a variety of MiGs, including the MiG-17 and the MiG-21. The DVD explains the basic advantages of each aircraft, although it fails to mention the crippling Rules of Engagement (ROE) inflicted on the US forces by the US government (by far worst under Johnson and McNamara) which definitely handicapped the ability of American forces to score more victories.

This one comes down to a big, fast, easy to see, smoking F-4 (with no gun,) versus very basic MiG aircraft that were small and difficult to see, but which were generally more maneuverable and had guns. In the dogfight that made Cunningham and Driscoll aces, the MiG was very skillfully flown (not the norm for the NVAF,) and between that skill and Cunningham's own mistakes, the outcome could have been (and almost was) decidedly different. Driscoll said ""It was a knife fight in a phone booth,"" and after watching the DVD, you will see why. Eventually Showtime 100 was hit by a Surface to Air Missile (SAM) which damaged their aircraft, ultimately requiring them to eject over the water, where they were promptly rescued and hailed as heroes. There's no doubt that Cunningham and Driscoll were worthy adversaries, but Steve Ritchie (whom Olds thought brilliant but brash) would have been at least as interesting to profile, but here is reduced to snippets of commentary; this is especially unfortunate in light of the disgusting bribery scandal that ended Cunningham's political career. Cunningham is still in prison, and is set to be released in 2013.

The show is well produced, and features good narration and very good explanatory graphics. It features lots of spaces for commercial breaks, and most annoyingly, lengthy recaps of what happened in the last segment after each break. This is a great DVD overall, though, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the history or aviation, and particularly the history or aerial combat and tactical aviation.",1271030400,4,5002,5.225404732254047
