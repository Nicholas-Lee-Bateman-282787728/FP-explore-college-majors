2223259,2,B0007N19WI,"First, I love Bruce Dern and Burt Reynolds. I could watch them just sit around and talk, and in fact those scenes are the best part of the movie. Hard Ground is a very predictable western with very predictable special effects (how many dynamite blow-ups in slow motion with people flying have you seen lately?)

The young female survivor of a stage coach massacre has got ""sand"" and alternates between being feisty and vulnerable on a very predictable basis. The estranged son of Burt is also heroic but oversleeps on the trail of the bad guys. The two veterans and the two young people pull together in the end to a very predictable climactic shoot-em-up with a very predictable outcome. Have I said this movie is totally formulaic and predictable?

Nevertheless, Burt and Bruce are always worth the price of admission, so I'd watch it, but not expect too many surprises. Hopefully next time the producers will actually hire writers who can develop characters and throw a few surprises in to spice up the movie.",1123804800,4,1012,4.777142857142858
2223260,4,B0007N19WI,"Another good movie of Bruce Dern as Marshal Hutchinson still crafty as he was in the movie ""Hang Them High"" and that was 30 yr's ago and still he looks good and very impressive. Burt and Bruce has such a good understanding that it seems both injoyed making this movie. Burt Reynolds as John McKay who was being transfered to Yuma Prison along with David Figlioli as Billy Bucklin as the chief villian and rest of the hardend criminal's in a prison van and they breakout leaving Burt Reynolds to die in the desert without water or horse. Thats where the story starts. The Outdoor Photography is really beautiful. The sunset in the mountains is breath taking. Marshal's sister married john McKay and had a son named joshua (Seth Peterson)who was broughtup by the marshal and he becomes his deputy and a decent citizen. Joshua rescue's a Elizabeth Kennedy (Amy Jo Johnson) on the way following the tracks of escapies. Its a deadly game of Manhunt,Story is Written by a famous writer Frank Q Dobbs (Johnson County War, Streets of Laredo)It was also directed by him. I liked this movie as any other good old western.",1123286400,8,1111,4.673469387755102

8049294,3,B0007N19WI,"2 decent movies at a very good price. Hope rose has some good acting by Lou and the story line is quite nice. Great picture quality . Hard Ground has some good scenery and also a good movie. Not great , but good. Neither one of these movies are filled with gunfights and brawls and there are some flaws about it being too clean and everything falling in to place too easily that you would find. But if you love westerns , it's one more for the collection. Service and prompt delivery by Amazon.",1400025600,,494,4.26595744680851
