I hate when movies show pepple picking right off a plant to smoke. there were a lot of things in this that were just stupid or poorly done. i liked how it starts in a dispensory. then it goes into complete stupidity. just watch cheech n chong half baked or pineapple express again.,1385596800,,415,4.546666666666667

5271886,3,B0095WH1UG,"This is another African-American stoner film. This one stars Devin Copeland and Roland Powell and is a cut below others in this genre such as ""Budz House."" The inconsistent plot (which is okay for a stoner film) concerns our heroes trying to steal plants from hillbillies in western Kentucky. The film incorporates ""chronic breaks"" or mellow trips at certain times to add to the pot humor.

The production exhibits many low brow qualities with its frequent racial humor directed at both blacks and whites. Frequent use of the N-word. A poorly and immaturely written script, that in spite of all the short comings and as disgusted as I was, I did find myself laughing at some of the confrontations.

I loved the cartoon Chronic Break sequence of ""Kush"" which combined classic ""Heavy Metal"" type animation with a ""Kill Bill"" type hero. If only the whole film had measured up.

This is a film that is better if seen stoned and by someone who never lived through the early civil rights era.

8536246,2,B0095WH1UG,"Highway is pretty bad.  Then again maybe it's supposed to be bad to show drug users how ridiculous they are.  Maybe drug users only are supposed to watch this.  It's about two stoner guys who take a road trip to Kentucky to find the ultimate marijuana stash.  For the most part the writing is really clumsy and doesn't make a bit of sense.  It relies on a style of humor only a pothead would understand, so that excludes me.  The characters aren't memorable at all, and the low budget acting and storytelling makes the movie unwatchable.

Since these two men are African American, it plays on the offensive stereotype that white people who frequently attend restaurants and bars in small country towns have very little tolerance towards the blacks who enter, so they're treated like crap and told to leave.  This might provide decent writing that serves an okay storyline for the sake of a film, but it's far-fetched and often untrue.  Anyway these two men eventually enter a hotel and meet an exceptionally silly lady behind the desk.  She was a memorable character which is more than I can say for anyone else.

When the two men eventually find the field, more racism segments occur since the police officers are white.  The whites are portrayed as intolerant buffoons who don't take kindly to blacks.  I feel the trip through the forest could've been way more exciting than it was.  The one guy wipes his behind with a rabbit.  They missed a great opportunity to play on the  ""white rabbit"" psychedelic drug joke.  Flat writing.  The two men arrive upon a group of country folks and everybody sings together (though it was slightly amusing how the one guy criticized the two black men for their musical contributions only to turn around and sing much worse himself while his friends and family thought he did a great job, lol).

Overall forgettable and unfunny writing, and bad characters all around.",1440201600,,1903,4.746951219512195
