3589644,2,B001FZQOQI,"I'm a die-hard Rocky Horror fan, so in the true spirit of obsessive fandom, I purchased this knowing it would mostly be for kicks.  I actually love the concept behind the whole set up... a vocal performance of the play by a variety of actors who'd been involved with it over the decades.

THE BAD: Sadly, by listening to it, you'd think that they just grabbed people off the street and invited them on stage as some sort of improv exercise.  It all kicks off with Patricia Quinn who was never my favourite vocalist 30 years ago when she had the energy to sing.  In this, she simply embarrasses herself and I'm embarrassed for her - it was uncomfortable to watch and a terrible way to start the DVD.  Sadly, it doesn't really pick up much from there.  The DVD case hails Anthony Stewart Head (of Buffy fame) as one of the best Frank's ever.  If he's one of the best, I can't imagine what you'd have to do to be one of the worst.  If you ever saw Tim Curry do the role live, then Head's attempt here would just make you angry.  I've seen better Frank's in high school productions.  Ben Richards isn't a terrible singer, but his interpretation of Hot Patootie is painful.  Everyone who plays Janet is immediately forgettable.  Stephen Gately once again turns in a performance that is sure to make people wonder how he has ever found success in the business with his nasally, pretentious voice and off-putting demeanour.  Adrian Edmondson as Brad is a good performer with a mediocre voice which at best makes him average.

THE GOOD: Gary Amers is brilliant and makes a perfect Rocky Horror - I have never seen anyone better in the role.  He stands out so far in front of this crowd it's not even funny.  Sadly, he gets all of 5 minutes of screen time.  The alternating narrators are all quite good and enjoyable.  Michael Ball is a decent Frank; sadly, he shows up at the end by which time he can't save the show.  Little Nell was quite wonderful!  I was expecting something sad and unfortunate like Patricia Quinn's spectacle, but Nell gave it all and was a lot of fun... again though, she only received 2 minutes of screen time at the very end.  The band was fine, the back-up singers were uniformly excellent.

THE UGLY: Richard O'Brien makes me strangely uncomfortable and always has.  I can't imagine his impact on people not drunk with delight over all things Rocky Horror.  I don't mind his energy and voice, but that's about it really.  The stage was an absolute mess.

THE VERDICT: It's a bit of a kick to throw the DVD in and sing along while pretending it's 25 years ago.  But, if you're not a Rocky Horror obsessed fan who dresses up for the shows on Halloween like myself, then there is absolutely no reason for you to consider buying/renting/watching this.  You will not make it through more that 10 minutes.  For the select crowd of Rocky Horror acolytes, you might enjoy it for the memories it evokes but will ultimately be sad that it doesn't add anything to the culture on its own.  1 stars out of 5.",1245801600,6,3014,4.467032967032967
3589645,2,B001FZQOQI,Sad. I didn't care for the actors or their singing. It was like if your local church or high school put on a presentation of RHPS. Patricia Quinn (Magenta) singing Science Fiction was absolutely horribly out of tune and step. The show doesn't improve from there. Had I know Netflix had it I would have rented it. Not worth the $$ !! Suprised Richard O BRien was connected with this. It was a benefits for some charity but it was ungodly bad!,1239235200,3,441,4.390243902439025
3589646,3,B001FZQOQI,"I admit I first bought this for Michael Ball, but I really love Rocky Horror Picture Show so I was incredibly excited to receive this. However, upon seeing it, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.

First off, the entire performance is done in a bit of concert style as opposed to it actually being performed, which I had no problem with. It was more the performers that were disappointing than anything. Even the ones that sang really well, seemed sloppy and all over the place (ie: not with the backup singers). The guy who played Rocky had an awesome voice, but how he sang the song was really bad with a lot of scooping up to notes as opposed to coming over them.

They also switched performers for some of the roles and the second girl to play Janet did really well, as did Anthony Michael Head and Michael Ball. All of the narrators did great, as was Riff Raff, but everyone else seemed like they just couldn't pull the role vocally.

All in all, it's worth a watch if you can rent it or borrow it. If you're a die hard Rocky fan, I would say buy it purely for some songs that weren't heard in the movie or the bits of trivia dropped in here and there or even a few things explained that were not in the movie. I regret buying it a little, but not enough to return it.",1233100800,5,1274,4.191836734693878

3589648,4,B001FZQOQI,"This is not the film nor is it trying to be, so,do not expect it to be like the film version. Instead, it is a slightly condensed,concert version of the stage show. It's simple, it's flawed but it's also a lot of fun to watch.",1418256000,2,226,4.044444444444444
3589649,5,B001FZQOQI,I'm a big RHPS fan and this show really is fantastic. Loved seeing different actors' interpretations of the characters and songs.,1401408000,,129,5.190476190476191
3589650,1,B001FZQOQI,"I didn't have any problems with the format, where they did a stage presentation of the story in brief, just to wrap around the songs. I HATED the singing though. Hardly anyone in this can carry a tune. No one in the audience carried on, shouting out the normal lines that are a big part of this show.

Don't waste your time on this.",1382054400,,332,4.1875
3589651,5,B001FZQOQI,"Simply great. It is something that if you are a RHPS fan must be in your collection.
A great experience to get all the great songs",1378339200,,130,4.038461538461538
3589652,5,B001FZQOQI,"Great entertainment,  but of course I'm totally biased being that Richard is a relative. Surely don't need to say anymore",1370908800,,121,5.05
3589653,5,B001FZQOQI,"I read about this concert version of ""The Rocky Horror Show"" when it happened but I had no idea it had been recorded. I was a hardcore RHPS fanatic back in the day and had no interest in any other version of Richard O'Brien's show until recently running across Anthony Head's rendition of ""Sweet Transvestite"" from this DVD, which introduced me to the idea that, although it may be a role that will forever be identified with Tim Curry and rightly so, Frank N. Furter is one of those great musical roles, like Don Giovanni, or Sweeney Todd, so powerful and with so many possibilities that it would be downright criminal to deny it new interpretations.

If you really want to see RHPS again, it's right there for you, but if you're prepared to explore other aspects of this legendary show I highly recommend this version, which features legendary talents, knockout performances and just plain priceless moments. Among them I'd list Kraig Thornber's thrilling vocals as Riff-Raff in ""Over at the Frankenstein Place,"" Anthony Head's wonderfully dirty ""Sweet Transvestite,""  the very funny narrative turn by Raynor Bourton (who created the role of Rocky Horror) opposite the dual rockabilly knockout of Gary Amer's ""Sword of Damocles"" and Ben Richards' ""Hot Patootie,"" Stephen Gately's lovely rendition of ""Once in a While"" (a surprisingly sweet ballad for Brad that's not in the film), Michael Ball's full-out Judy Garland in ""I'm Going Home,"" and heavily nostalgia-inducing featured spots by Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, and Richard O'Brien himself. Go ahead and make the investment. It's for a good cause!",1362873600,,1606,5.079545454545454

3589655,4,B001FZQOQI,"If your a huge Rocky Horror fan of course you'll love this dvd! I enjoyed it, but I wish the case had more artistic cover than a blurry group photo. If your a Buffy fan you will also enjoy seeing Niles sing Sweet Transvestite.",1298937600,,226,4.159090909090909
3589656,4,B001FZQOQI,"I bought this as a gift after searching for items hits for Anthony Stewart Head for a Buffy Fanatic (who also loves RHPS) and we found this show to be extremely entertaining.  We were surprised by the format at first, but everyone who showed up for the Tribute show did a great job with their songs, dialogue and actions.  We recommend this for anyone who loves Rocky!",1294704000,3,368,4.477611940298507

8303161,3,B001FZQOQI,Not bad concert version with many RH alumni narrating and performing the songs. I'm still looking for the Rocky Horror SHOW Anniversay DVD that BBC America  broadcast two Halloweens ago.,1495152000,,186,5.2
8303162,3,B001FZQOQI,"THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW debuted at the Royal Court Theatres upstairs stage in 1973, had an unexpected popularity, and went on to become one of Englands longest running musicalsnot to mention THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, a film version that opened in 1975 and went on become everybodys favorite midnight cult audience participation movie.  In 2006, creator Richard OBrien arranged for a 33rd anniversary celebration of the original play in its original theatre, albeit on the downstairs (and larger) stage.  It was not a performance per se, rather it was a concert edition with narration, and the cast included appearances by OBrien, who introduces the show; Patricia Quinn, the original Magenta; and Little Nell, the original Columbia.  Great idea, huh?  Wellmaybe it played better on the stage than it does in this DVD.

Anthony Head is a knock out with Frank N. Furters Sweet Transvestite, and when Michael Ball takes over the role for The Floor Show he nails it too.  Kraig Thomber, who plays Riff Raff, and Toyah Wilcox and Amy Field, who play Magenta and Columbia, are pretty damn good too.  But they aren't enough to make the concert work, and the rest of the players seem under-rehearsed, to say the least.  I mean, when the back-up singers sound substantially better than the stars  well, lets just say the whole thing lacks zip.  And then there are the cameos.  OBrien doesnt perform, he merely introduces the event; Patricia Quinn, the original Magenta, does sing, and she should have thought better of it.  But Little Nell shows shes still go the stuff in a final reprise of Time Warp, and that at least gives the ending some punch.

If you're a hardcore Rocky Horror fan youll want to see this, no doubt.  But don't expect a lot from it.  If you do, youll be disappointed.
