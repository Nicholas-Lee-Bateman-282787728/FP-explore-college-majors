5031924,5,B006X64S7Q,"Can anyone tell me if the ""love scene"" is in the Blu-ray disc? Has anyone also noticed that the scene is completely cut in some versions? As frustrating as finding the director's cut of ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" that shows Dave in full frontal.

5031925,5,B006X64S7Q,"You can finally get rid of the bare bone Paramount DVD as the Criterion Collection Blu-Ray features an excellent transfer that preserves the grain of the film stock while also delivering a pristine print, which is particularly evident in the dimly-lit scenes. Cat Stevens' songs sound particular good on the sound side of things.

There is an audio commentary by Hal Ashby biographer Nick Dawson, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Hal-Ashby-Life-of-a-Hollywood-Rebel-Screen-Classics/dp/0813125383/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Hal Ashby: Life of a Hollywood Rebel (Screen Classics)</a>, and one of the film's producers Charles B. Mulvehill. Dawson takes us through the genesis of the project, including Colin Higgins' screenplay and Ashby going from his first film to Harold and Maude. Mulvehill recalls all kinds of filming anecdotes including casting and its disastrous reception. Dawson analyzes the film's themes in depth with some excellent insights on this very informative track.

Disappointingly, the film's trailer is not included despite being referenced in detail on the commentary as containing deleted footage.

There are audio excerpts from AFI seminars with Ashby and Higgins in '72 and '79 respectively. Ashby talks about how he got his start as an editor. Naturally, he talks about how he got the job to direct Harold and Maude while also discussing the challenge of casting the role of Harold. Higgins talks about the genesis of the script and the inspiration for Maude. Both are very engaging and informative.

Finally, there is an interview with Yusuf/Cat Stevens. He talks about how he got interested in making music as a way to express himself. Of course, he talks about how he got involved with Harold and Maude. Ashby was a big fan and used some of Stevens' songs during filming. The director even invited the musician to the set to see how he wanted to use his music.",1340064000,7,1952,5.518394648829432
5031926,5,B006X64S7Q,"Once again, I have to tip my hat to Criterion on yet another superb release. There is an optional stereo track that sounds incredible. Cat Stevens never sounded so good. The video transfer is great too, considering how old this movie is. All of the colors are quite vibrant and, even though I've seen this movie many times over the years, i noticed little things in this version that I had never noticed before. I won't elaborate for fear of ruining the movie for the people out there who haven't seen it yet. I've waited a long time for the blu-ray version and now its finally here. Thanks again Criterion! FIVE STARS!",1339632000,7,619,4.535714285714286
5031927,4,B006X64S7Q,"I saw this film in the theater and owned it on DVD and Blu-ray as soon as they became available. This review is not about the movie but the blu-ray release.

So the question becomes is it an overall better picture than the DVD? My simple answer is, yes, slightly better. Only a tiny bit better. If I would rate the picture quality of the DVD version as a 5 of 10, I would give the blu-ray release picture quality a 5.2 of 10 scale.

I've been watching on an up-converting Panasonic Blu-ray player, watching with an Optoma 3D projector on a glass-bead screen. There is a slight improvement in resolution with the blu-ray version. There is still video noise and grainy-ness because lots of the movie is shot in dark settings. I also watched on a Vizio BR player and TV and had about the same change compared to the DVD.

One of the benchmarks I use is when Harold and Maude are sitting outside near San Fransisco Bay. There is a highway sign in the distance. This is about 69 minutes into the film. The ability to read the sign is really not improved, even though it is mostly in focus. This scene was filmed on San Fransisco Bay in Emeryville, CA along the I-80/580 exprwy, near the intersection of I-80 and Powell St. in the mud flats. If you look very closely you can see the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge next to Maude.

If you are a fan of this film like I am I suggest listening to the supplementary audio when watching, it gives a lot of insight into how the film was made and why it looks the way it does. Also contains many insights into the actors skills and personalities.",1339545600,11,1589,4.304347826086956
5031928,5,B006X64S7Q,"They don't make black comedies much funnier than HAROLD AND MAUDE (1971).

In director Hal Ashby's cult classic starring Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort, Cort is a rich, lonely young man with a dominating mother who enjoys faking his own suicide, while Gordon is a 79-year-old mischief-maker, who will do just about anything that strikes her fancy.

Could any two people be more perfect for each other?

Cort's bogus suicide attempts are sidesplitting hilarious; the funniest moments in the movie.

The Criterion Collection has released a new ""Special Edition"" of HAROLD AND MAUDE, featuring a new digital restoration and an optional remastered stereo soundtrack.  It also includes audio commentary by Hal Ashby biographer Nick Dawson and the film's producer, Charles B. Mulvehill, plus illustrated audio excerpts from seminars by Ashby and writer-producer  Colin Higgins, and a new interview with songwriter  Yusuf/Cat Stevens.

Finally, the set contains an essay-filled booklet that includes a profile on the late Ms. Gordon and interviews with Court and others connected with the picture.

I personally saw this film in San Francisco in 1974 not realizing what a hit it still is today.  This movie is aimed at all of you free-thinkers out there!  I always liked Cat Stevens' music.

5032002,5,B006X64S7Q,"Weren't the Seventies great?  It isn't often that the stars align just right to create movie magic.  Director Hal Ashby was coming off the critical success of ""The Landlord"".  Colin Higgins would later write the Seventies Hitchcockian comic classics ""Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"".  Bud Cort was coming off starring in Robert Altman's askewed dark comic classic ""Brewster McCloud"".  Ruth Gordon was adding another character to her gallery of off-the-wall geriatrics.  In order for ""Harold and Maude"" to succeed you have to believe in the central conceit of a twenty year old man with a death fixation mutually falling in love with an eighty year old free spirit otherwise it's a cynical exercise.  These are not stereotypes but fully realized characters.  One would have to note that Harold's staged suicides are probably more a cry for love than for attention.  One would also have to notice the markings on Maude's arm probably the result of German atrocities.  Not once do you disbelieve this relationship.  Not in the performances of Cort and Gordon or in Ashby's direction or in the script.  If you followed Ashby's career his films celebrate iconoclasm and he could be viewed as something of a maverick himself by making very personal films that through some act of God were green lighted by the studios.  Good supporting turns by Vivian Pickles as Harold's frustrated mother, G. Wood, an Altman vet, as Harold's psychiatrist, Charles Tyner as Harold's militaristic uncle, Eric Christmas as a priest disgusted by Harold and Maude's relationship, and Judy Geer as an actress Harold's mother tries to fix him up with.  I failed to mention the terrific song score offered by Cat Stevens which includes the beautiful ""If You Want To Be Free, Be Free"" as something of a signature theme for the two lovers.  Oddly, at the time of the film's release they didn't issue a soundtrack album.  It's only available on an out-of-print vinyl issue that came out some years after the film's release which also includes Gordon's version of the aforementioned song and the price is quite steep for even a second hand copy. Is it no wonder that a film that flopped both critically and commercially at the time of initial release has endeared itself to audiences forty years later?  I last saw this film when I was sixteen on a double feature with ""The King of Hearts"" which is currently discontinued on DVD.  Are you listening, Criterion?  I didn't appreciate the subtleties of the film at the time because of my youth and my inexperience in the ways of love but thirty-four years on I am touched by its resonance and poignancy.",1375574400,6,2616,4.877828054298643

Still charming, off-beat, and looks better that it ever did. Talks about youth and age, and is very fascinating when you see it as a young adult and now as a senior citizen. What was anarchic and outrageous then, still strikes a cord, today. I think everyone would still laugh at it's counter- culture message.

Great Hal Ashby direction, and wonderful quirky performances.  Bud Cort who we've  seen in MASH, BREWSTER MCCLOUD and recently in THE LIFE AQUATIC is a one-of-a-kind talent, and Ruth Gordon is just like she was in everything, post DAISY CLOVER, a batty, wildly free-wheeling old broad.

I had the laser disc in the 80s, and this really outdoes it in many ways.

5032012,5,B006X64S7Q,"Seeing that HAROLD & MAUDE is now a 'CRITERION COLLECTION'-- I feel I should share my personal connections to the film ... (and for the true film lovers, you may just dig it!)

In 1970, I was 12 years old and living in the ocean side of the 'Fairway District' in Pacifica, California.

Whilst waiting one Winter's morn for the school bus to take several of my classmates and your humble narrator off to my 7th-Grade school -- I spied many production trucks up on the hill.  Chief amongst the vehicles up there, was a strange-looking Jaguar.

This was 'HAROLD'S' Jag that roared off the cliff in the last scene.

Rather than getting on the school bus when it ultimately arrived -- I took off and went closer to the dirt road.  At the entrance to the dirt road, I asked one of the production crew the name of the movie -- (likely a 'production assistant' as he was tired and wired young and had a walkie-talkie strapped to his belt) -- and he replied 'HAROLD & MAUDE' ...

Well, I would go on in the years to come to being a 'production assistant' myself on many films and worked my way up the production food chain to a produced screenwriter and commercial director with 600 spots and tons of awards.

In short ------ one of the films I was a production assistant on in the mid 1980's was 'FREE SPIRIT' that ultimately was released as 'MAXIE' (Glenn Close, Mandy Patinkin -- and Paul Arron was the Director).  And guess who was in the cast as the wacky, ball of energy, 70-something neighbor?  Bingo, you got it in one -- RUTH GORDON!

In all of the San Francisco scenes on 'Maxie', I was detailed to make sure Ruth got to the set from her hotel, had anything she wanted, etc.  One day I told her about seeing the 'HAROLD & MAUDE' up on the hill above my housing tract when I was 12.  She told me many things -- but most of all, I was fortunate to have worked with 'Maude' -- THE Ruth Gordon on 'MAXIE', her last film.

This film is as close to perfect as cinema can get, and with an enduring sense of profound joy in life.

I love the scene where Harold is high and tells Maude he's accumulating vices - and she responds ""Vice, Virtue. It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much *life.* Aim above morality. If you apply that to life, then you're bound to live life fully.""

There is an astonishingly increased amount of detail in this Blu-ray edition (by Criterion) and the soundtrack is crystal clear and dynamic in both the stereo and two channel mono options (especially in regard to Cat Stevens music). I'm looking forward to watching it next time with the commentary, and to enjoying the extras, but it is enough to have the film itself preserved in such carefully restored true high definition - because this is as an eternally relevant classic.",1342396800,14,1058,4.587301587301587

I have watched it twice since it came in the mail from Amazon and I have a feeling that I'll be watching it again.. perhaps even today. If you've never seen it, you simply must. If you haven't seen it recently, it's time to renew your friendship with these two amazing people..er...characters.",1341964800,3,492,4.590909090909091

8506125,5,B006X64S7Q,"""Harold and Maude"" is a 1970's era gem that creeps right into your subconscious and never leaves and is one of the best, in and out, of its genre. Ruth Gordon, with delightful focus and subtle brilliance, treats the audience to her character ""Maude"", a spry, elderly woman who is forward thinking, worldly, intelligent, innovative and despite her advanced age, can seem to be much younger than her almost 80 years. Bud Cort, with controlled boyish charm and dry humor, creeps his character ""Harold"" into your subconscious and ends up, and you can never really know why, being a sort of reluctant, Gothic heartthrob. Regarding the age differences of the two title characters and their blossoming romance, there isn't the usual ""forced acting"" aspect that one might expect. The two seem well fit for this macabre pairing. Their odd chemistry keeps you eagerly rooting for their ""May / December"" relationship to work and last. ""Harold and Maude"" will appeal to a wide range of people and especially to those who love, offbeat movies from the 1960's and the 1970's. I love this movie and highly recommend it !",1510012800,3,1105,4.882978723404255
