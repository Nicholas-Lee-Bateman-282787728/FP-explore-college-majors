3162756,4,B0016Q0OEO,Our family loves WordWorld. The only drawback to this DVD was only having 3 episodes on it. Wish they would put more episodes on it to make it a bit more enticing. I would buy it again tho. My daughter loved it through the holidays.,1359072000,,232,4.177777777777778

3162761,3,B0016Q0OEO,Great WordWorld that my kids love as usual but only 33 minutes long.  I'm sure the DVD duration was listed somewhere but I just expected it to be longer like the others I've purchased.,1325203200,,184,4.411764705882353
3162762,5,B0016Q0OEO,"My 9month old son genuinely enjoys this show. Its one of the few that hold his attention. As a parent I am pleased with the concept and tactics used to teach children to read, spell, and speak. This is the second dvd I have purchased and I will definately purchase more in the near future",1324166400,,288,4.254545454545455

3162766,2,B0016Q0OEO,"My son loves Word World, so i got this DVD for him. However, the 'playing time' info on the product description misled me to think there was actually 60 min of episode on the DVD. Not so - it is 30 min. The other 30 min are commercials. Not worth $7 - sorry. Big rip off. Now i know not to purchase any more of these 2-episode sets.",1289865600,12,332,3.8970588235294117
3162767,5,B0016Q0OEO,"I just bought this, I know its May, but my 5 year old is so anxious to learn how to read i encourage this type of show. She LOVES this. Something that I,  as a conservative, appreciate is the use of CHRISTMAS in this video, not sure why they didn't name it a Christmas show, but they are not shy about it in the movie.

My daughter was fortunate enough to attend a Catholic preschool where she got to have a Christmas Party and sing God Bless America, i dread public school next year.",1274659200,,484,4.138297872340425
3162768,5,B0016Q0OEO,Wonderful Holiday DVD for toddlers.  Love the Word World PBS show as it is educational in every way from learning how to read and your letters to how to treat people.  Just a GREAT DVD to watch over and over.,1273795200,,208,4.175
3162769,5,B0016Q0OEO,"I love this series!  Even as I write this review, my 3 year old is jumping up and down because he sees the ""word word"" dvd picture on this page.  He should actually be the one writing this review, perhaps.  Anyway, you won't regret this purchase!

And as a side note- if you're shopping for Word World DVDs, this and the other themed DVDs don't give you as many episodes for the money, but it is fun to have a themed video to play on the holiday itself.",1266192000,5,453,4.113636363636363
3162770,5,B0016Q0OEO,Bought this for my two year old.  Both stories have great themes of friendship and sharing that I hope will be internalized over time. The stories illustrate what good friends do for one another. I also used the CD to introduce Christmas concepts such as the Christmas tree and writing letters to Santa. Very happy with this purchase as I have been with all the other Word World CD's in our collection.,1264982400,,402,4.583333333333333
3162771,5,B0016Q0OEO,"WordWorld is one of my son's favorite shows. As soon as the theme song comes on he comes running to the tv or stops what he is doing. I love it too because it is a PBS Kids cartoon and it teaches letters, amongst other things! If you have never seen WordWorld before, it is a show where are the characters and most of the scenery is made up of the letters that spell them. It is adorable and bright and has very catchy music too!

Since Christmas is going to be here in less than a month we have started watching Christmas movies to get into the spirit. Well since Aidan loves Word World, we of course have to watch Happy Holidays WordFriends! It is a new Christmas DVD featuring all the WordWorld characters and features 2 episodes. Aidan was so excited as soon as he saw the box and even more excited when the show started. The two episodes are The Christmas Star and A Christmas Present for DOG. The first episode takes place the night before Christmas and features FROG and DUCK trying to get a star for FROG's tree through teamwork. The second episode takes place Christmas morning and all of the Wordfriends are excited because Santa brought them all presents, except DOG whose present didn't make it all down the chimney. This episode shows sacrifice and friendship.

Overall, we of course love this DVD and will be watching it probably year round! I just love the themes in the episodes and would rather Aidan watch Word World than some other cartoon that doesn't teach anything. I haven't seen this episode yet on PBS and I am not sure if they will be airing it or not, but for $6.99 at Amazon, it is worth it I think!

I received this DVD to review it, but it has not been edited and is 100% my opinion.",1259452800,8,1713,4.346875
