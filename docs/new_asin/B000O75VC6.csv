8183146,1,B000O75VC6,"I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FILM! THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE A LONG AND SUSPENSEFUL FLICK I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THERE WAS ONLY 10 MINUTES TO THIS MOVIE AND NOTHING MORE! I PAID $15 DOLLARS FOR A RIDICULOUS 10 MINUTE FLICK THAT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  TO OFFER BUT 10 MINUTES OF BORED,RAPID DISAPPOINTMENT! I RECOMMEND NO ONE BUY THIS FILM BECAUSE IT IS A TOTAL 10 MINUTE RIP OFF AND NOT WORTH YOUR VALUABLE MONEY! THIS FLICK AND IT'S DIRECTOR CAN GO TO HELL!",1219190400,2,469,4.329545454545454
8183147,4,B000O75VC6,"I am giving this DVD 4 stars, because it was well-acted, interesting, and a good plot/ending.  BUT I thought is was a full-length movie!!!  My mistake- I essentially paid full price for a twilight zone episode.
Still worth watching, but not for the price of a movie.",1209427200,,266,4.638297872340425
8183148,5,B000O75VC6,"Steven J. Hadden has a knack for directing. Being a fan of ""Where's Julie"" and having seen some of his obscure early work, I plan on keeping a look out for all new films by this director.",1177459200,,187,4.081081081081081
8183149,5,B000O75VC6,"Where's Julie's is a fast paced, well-acted indie short reminescent of Fatal Attraction, with a clever fun ending. Highly recommended for all filmmakers to watch. All the prodcution aspects of the film are well coordinated (editing, music, etc.) Plus the writing is clever and crisp!! Have fun watching!!",1175126400,4,304,5.354166666666667
8183150,5,B000O75VC6,"Is there anyone in NYC who has met someone who seemed like a normal person, you dated them for a half a minute, and then you realize you're dealing with a complete lunatic?  A man wakes up to find himself bound and his fianc missing while a strange woman claiming to be his fianc grows increasingly frustrated with his inability to accept the veracity of their engagement and her attachment to him. Imagine this as a kind of 10 minute Fatal Attraction-only a whole lot crazier.",1173657600,5,477,4.546511627906977
