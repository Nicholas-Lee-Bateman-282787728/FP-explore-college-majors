8333047,1,B001PCNZJ0,"I showed this film in my class.  This movie is indescribably bad. I had read several reviews, which indicated it was taking a serious look at  the exploitation of cultures. I quote: ""Souvenir is one of the few movies out there that shines light on one of the hottest themes of today's art world - illegal appropriation of art."" This is a poorly acted, exploitive, misogynistic film that uses sex to try to make it interesting. DO NOT RENT THIS FILM, it is terrible!  My class clapped at the end, because, it was OVER!  At least we were able to laugh.",1381795200,,550,4.415841584158416
8333048,2,B001PCNZJ0,"It saddens me to be the bearer of bad news, but this film is NOTHING like the previous reviewers claim; most of them must have associations with the film, which is somewhat common on Amazon. It is NOT a mystery, it is NOT a thriller, it is NOT well-directed and it is NOT a good film. I know, you're probably thinking to yourself, ""Well, this is one bad review out of five"" (and usually I myself disregard the one bad review in the bunch, as there's always someone out there you can't please, no matter how hard you try). But my profile on Amazon clearly indicates most folks find my reviews helpful, so you'll have to judge for yourself after reading (or ignoring) my criticisms. I considered it to be dreadfully disappointing and boring. Thankfully, it clocks in well-under 80 minutes, but it seemed like two hours. Stolen moments about stolen artifacts, no more, no less, IMHO.

One-third of the way through the proceedings, you kind of get the idea what's actually going on, who the perpetrator of the crime is, how the saga evolved and the role of the principal character; even if you didn't, there's not much of a pay-off. The only likable character is the African woman (and if realism was expected, they could've at least gotten a real African actress for the role); all the rest are downright despicable or instantly forgettable.

The art gallery owner, Ivy, inherits a cache of ancient African funerary posts from her father upon his passing, and we see a flashback of her as a child with dear old dad in the bushland with his cronies hovering over the dead bodies of some natives, his men armed with rifles, natives shot dead. Any mystery there? Ivy's now a middle-aged alcoholic who abuses the men in her life, manipulates those she conducts business with, and has a separated husband who secretly watches her every move. She needs to sell the artifacts to save her gallery, and the appraisal is even far more than she imagined, but before she can unload them, she's served injunction papers from a government agency questioning how the goods came into her or her fathers' possession. The issue of legitimacy of said ownership is on the table, and is slowly destroying Ivy's world. Her reputation, career, sanity and salvation depends on her concealing the secret that her father was a war criminal (this isn't a spoiler; it's in the product details, that's why I said there's no mystery or thrills to be had). So she undergoes the scrutiny meant for her father's sins - Finding any thrills there? Me either.

Director Natasa Prosenc's flaws are abundant and unforgivable here. The lighting in a good deal of scenes is dark and grainy, devoid of contrast. There are an unrepentant amount of annoying close-ups that actually distance you from the characters rather than suck you in, and the details roll out like toilet paper sheets as opposed to what a director with skills would achieve to keep the pace moving and affect some vibrancy into the void that's created. The camera angles showed no imagination, only budgetary constraints. The script needed re-formatting to achieve what it set out to do, some development and back story on the additional players was sorely needed (only Ivy's role is fleshed out, and she's too unredeemable to take interest in) to pique and hold our interest, the soundtrack was one of the film's highlights (in stark contrast to another reviewer's comments) and these poor directorial skills paraded around here turned me off entirely. I kept thinking (along with my wife) ""Something's gotta give soon"" and nothing does. It's a miasma of quicksand. When the end credits rolled, I felt cheated and deceived (sorry, but I take these things personally sometimes).
It's a film about stolen African art that amounts to stolen time in an artless film.",1304985600,2,3789,4.808282208588957
8333049,5,B001PCNZJ0,"In Souvenir a viewer first submerges into a very seductive atmosphere created by inovative lighting and shooting techniques, and then the story starts unfolding with unhurried but powerful twists. The characters are easy to identify with, but at the same time they appear almost like zombies inhabiting this dark sensual world of old art, sexual tensions and greed. It's been a while since I've seen Souvenir at a festival but I still carry the images and scenes in me. The filmmakers offer a very visceral experience by creating this project; Souvenir touches your heart as much as it affects your brain. American sense of storytelling is combined with European artistic touch. A totally unique story, which doesn't only rely on historical facts, but reaches out to examine a larger picture of post - colonial world.",1238716800,,817,5.059259259259259
8333050,5,B001PCNZJ0,"Souvenir is one of the few movies out there that shines light on one of the hottest themes of today's art world - illegal appropriation of art. Good thing: It doesn't feel preachy. In fact, the film adds a sexy smart to what could be - in less-skilled hands - a potentially dry topic. Beautifully shot, fantastically lit and full of suspense, this film has plenty for everyone -- thrill, mystery, and pure, natural romance. (I love the sweet bicycle ride...awww) NOTE: Director Natasa Prosenc has created some of the steamiest sex scenes I've encountered in cinema! I look forward to more work by this director. MUST SEE!",1236902400,,621,4.7592592592592595
8333051,4,B001PCNZJ0,"Souvenir is gripping, thrilling and emotional. It's a mystery/thriller film with so much substance, it really pulls you in as an audience member. The characters are provocative and their relationships very unpredictable. It is also a great portrait of Los Angeles with unusual locations shot in a most creative way.  Although I liked the music, I thought it may have been a little over done.  Overall, the timely topic, story and style add up to a very enjoyable film experience.",1236729600,2,479,4.975
8333052,5,B001PCNZJ0,"I thoroughly enjoyed Natasa Prosenc's Souvenir. It's so refreshing to finally see a movie that actually projects a vision and not only edits images.
The theme itself is attractive and contemporary: it clearly sets up the parameters of colonial mentality - appropriation and dislocation of artifacts that end up interacting with a space in which they don't belong; they're like the homeless in front of the gallery space. I also thought the film's narrative structure was very successful because the libidinal economy between the characters (especially between Balthasar and Ivy) mirrors the perversity of the post-colonial ""exchange."" To top it all off, the overall look of the film is simply gorgeous, with an astoundingly beautiful cinematography and exquisite inserts of experimental installations. The experimental installation of the vortex emphasizes the film's sensually textured imagery, which resurfaces into that first - amazing and erotically charged - love making scene. Another unforgettable sequence is the concluding one, at Aurora's exhibition. I found those superimpositions of the installations and the white-skinned Ivy very powerful. Not only does it reflect the fact that colonial mentality still persists in today's world, but simultaneously comments on the contemporary economy of power, which is still white. This is a truly intelligent and engaging film that exposes the cultural artifact as a contemporary tool of the political manipulation of our post-colonial era. Cheers!",1235001600,,1500,5.671111111111111
