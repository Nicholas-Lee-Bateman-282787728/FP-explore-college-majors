4662322,5,B005DVIOAO,"This is among the very best--British or American.  Were it not for the need for sleep, I would have watched it all in one sitting.  If only there were a season 2!  The quality of the acting, the detailed forensics, and the suspense-building were first-rate.  A seasoned whodunit fan, even I was fooled. Great drama, whatever your tastes.",1333843200,3,337,4.758620689655173
4662323,1,B005DVIOAO,"I was sadly disappointed after having purchased this.  This item was recommended by Amazon based on other British Mysteries I bought.  This is nothing more than a modern day version of Hill Street Blues.  The acting is great if that is what you are looking for but I was expecting a nice murder mystery plot based on the product description.  The series deals much more with the private lives of the detectives involved than actually trying to catch the murderer.  If are looking for a good murder mystery, look elsewhere.  I will be reselling my copy.",1329091200,15,552,4.697916666666667
4662324,5,B005DVIOAO,"In this very good and intense British Miniseries (or just series in two seasons or movie in twelve parts or whatever you want to call it) ""Without Motive"", the viewing audience gets a ""peek"" at what it takes for a group of cops/detectives to catch a very ruthless and crafty serial killer (and its ""copy cat"") that seems to be on a murdering rampage without any motive.

In the twelve (12) interrelated episodes (actually it's two seasons of solving one case and its ""copy cat"") on four (4) discs we, the viewing audience, are given privy to seeing the ""toll"" that solving these very horrendous cases (the murders are very savage and seem for no reason) takes on the personal lives of a group of cops/detectives in Bristol, England along with many deep jealousies and ""blind"" ambitions.  We get to see good cops and bad ones along with others at all levels of their professions working and dealing with this case(s) along with the ramifications thereof.  Believe me this case(s) helps to  cause the disintegration of families, the end of careers and it certainly ""brings out"" the best and the worse in those that are trying to find the killer(s) before he/she strikes again wrecking everyone's nerves that are involved. The detectives shown solving this case are NOT ""super cool"" or suave just very human men and women trying to catch very ruthless killers without much help from ""high tech"" equipment.

This series is really wonderfully acted and directed keeping me ""glued"" to my TV until ""all is revealed""--it will keep you guessing. I adored some characters and disliked others--all being so very ""real""; the series is acted so very well.  Do put the kiddies to bed before viewing this series because it truly is ""grown-up"" entertainment with violence, sex and graphic scenes that are done so very well.  (By the way series one on the first two discs solves the initial case and series two on the next two discs solves its ""copy cat"".)

Be advised that Series two (the last two discs) is really written, acted and dircted most brillantly--you'll really be ""spell-bound"".",1327449600,3,2074,4.822535211267605
4662325,1,B005DVIOAO,"Not very good.  Ross Kemp was good in Eastenders, but he has a very limited range -- glowering and rage, and very little else.  I'd skip this one.",1325548800,3,146,4.178571428571429
4662326,5,B005DVIOAO,"This set contains both season 1 and season 2 of this drama. You need to see both to get the full punch that this program carries. In 12 episodes, the viewer is allowed to see both the solving of the crime and the emotional toll it takes on the police detectives who are working to solve the case. There is a serial killer loose and no matter how hard the police try, there seems to be no motive or reason why the killer chooses the women he kills.  The police must go through all the dry and boring lists looking for some vague factor that ties the victims together.  It is pains taking work and no matter how much effort is put into their search, no break is forthcoming. In the meantime, the press and even family members become very vocal in their criticism of the lack of progress in the case.  The detectives start to exhibit siege mentality turning to each other and closing out others.  It is very interesting to see the toll that such a case takes on all involved.
  I look for good acting, strong character development and good plotting before giving 5 stars. This series gave me all that I sought.  Very good viewing.",1321401600,17,1127,4.363636363636363
4662327,4,B005DVIOAO,"David Johnson, DVD Verdict --This decade-old crime series from the U.K. serves up two seasons worth of across-the-pond investigation. Each series contains six episodes and involves one contiguous case.

That case: a serial killer is on the loose butchering women and there doesn't appear to be a connection (hence the title Without Motive). Dubbed ""The Bristol Murderer,"" the perpetrator has the community frozen with fear and the authorities paralyzed with futility. Caught in the middle of all of it is Detective Constable Jack Mowbray (Ross Kemp), a big-shot investigator who's feeling the shockwaves of the killing spree at home, as his family begins falling apart (his marital indiscretions don't help either). Things aren't much better at work as the infectiveness of the department in catching the killer leads to intense political pressure from above and a series of leads that go dead. As the bodies pile up, so do the questions and Mowbray will have to call upon all of his stocky, bald cop bravado to bring this one home.

Ross Kemp is awesome in this as a brooding, flawed detective with a snarl and a penchant for taking a dump on authority. He's not quite the nuclear weapon Vic Mackey is, but you can see the seeds there. Mowbray is a compelling point man and Without Motive succeeds because it takes a comprehensive look at the case and the characters. Mowbray takes his work home with him and as a result some of the most compelling material happens outside of the precinct.

If the household drama doesn't interest you as much, rest assured there is plenty of crime-fighting to indulge in, and it's all done extremely well. The fact that the show is concerned with one extended case and not a series of one-offs makes it feel more like a feature film or miniseries than anything else. This way, the writers can get into every angle of the investigation, with the infighting of the brass just as interesting as the detectives pounding the pavement.

Acorn delivers another solid release, rendering each episode in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen and 2.0 stereo. Series One and Series Two look different, stylistically, with the former coming across as more a static TV show and the latter adopting a hand-held approach with a grittier cinematography. No extras.

4662328,5,B005DVIOAO,"A riveting, thriller, cop series. A serial killer defies being caught, since he is murdering WITHOUT MOTIVE. It drives the cop-team mad in this 2 season (year) series. It plays as a 12 episode mini-series, since all episodes center around the same investigation plot, same cast. Yes, there are plenty of episode subplots of adultery, misadventure, bad-good cop, back-stabbing, relationships, etc. But truly, it's like a 600 min.(10 hr) edge-of-your-seat feature. We watched this 4DVD Complete Series Set, over 3 evenings.
SUBTITLES included. Filmed on story location, Bristol, UK.

A strong cast is headed by DC Jack Mowbray (Ross Kemp) good cop, a bit aggressive, with family & fidelity issues. DCS Henderson (Kenneth Cranham) soon to retire likes the hero limelight. DC Boulter (Jamie Foreman) Jack's mate, but can he be trusted? Sally (Hazel Ellerby) Jack's wife, also unstable due to cop family stress. ACC Stocks (Ian Bartholomew) overall head of the long investigation.
One must-mention significant character, appearing in over half the episodes is Bobby Jackson, a witless suspect, played by Karl Johnson. He thrills to the level of the lead. This amazing actor was also stupendous in his portrayal as Twister in ""Larkrise to Candleford"", a must-view/own series. ""Without Motive"" is another example of this man's capability, making a non-leading role memorable.
Add top performances by lovely Lou Gish, Sean Murray, and Jane Hazlegrove.

The murderer strikes violently with hammer and knives, mutilating, seemingly Without Motive. There is plenty of blood, graphic murder & morgue scenes to suggest only adult viewing. Lots of drinking, smoking, sex, rivalry-and that's the cops.

This 2 season series, each with 6 episodes (50 min), begins with (series 1) a desperate beginning search for a serial killer, followed by (series 2) a continuation really, but what seems to be a copy-cat murderer. It's a behind the scenes look at relationships and stress among the cops as well as their off-duty lives. Not a `pretty' cop series. It's grimy and grippingly gritty.

Episode synopsis if you like more details. I mentioned having SDH SUBITLES.

Series 1, Ep 1- Bristol Red light dist. murder with a hubby as primary suspect. DC Jack Mowbray has doubts due to 3 other brutal prostitute killings in South Wales.
1,2- Four murder joint investigation suggests the Welsh half's leader with incompetence issues. A 5th kill--to close to Mowbray's family.
1,3- Jack's wife is afraid since latest death has a pizzeria link to the 1st Wales murder.
1,4- A delivery driver with violent `form' is Jack's #1 suspect, but there are other leads. Jack makes a mistake.
1,5- A new victim lowers cop morale and sends Jack to a therapist. Killer strikes again.
1,6- Jack's on leave--off the serial killer case but with a home disaster. Finally an arrest--without a confession.
Series 2, Ep 1- The serial killer from Series 1 is convicted, jailed, but a copy-cat murder occurs next day.
2,2- Is it a revenge or comp-cat killing? Some cops are taken to court for negligence in their duty & manslaughter.
2,3- Insider info feeds the prosecution in the cops' court trial. Women killings continue.
2,4- A lady cop murder shakes up the force in more ways than one. Some evidence in the earlier conviction was suppressed.
2,5- Convicted man is released as evidence is reappraised. Finally, a real link surfaces.
2,6- The special team is so close to a capture, they can almost see him. A wild action packed terrorizing finish to a sinister serial killer story.

It's a strange feeling at this saga's end, to wish the mutilated murders would continue. A tribute to the writing and gripping intensity of this production.",1315180800,33,3693,5.095867768595041

4662350,5,B005DVIOAO,"Want more I love Ross Kemp from Ultimate Force he is good to watch
enjoyed the politics and the plot keeps you in. The right mix of police story work with personal lives makes the characters more real and believable  Hope they do another series,",1404259200,,245,4.444444444444445
4662351,5,B005DVIOAO,This is a stimulating and thought-provoking series that not only entertains but provides the watcher with an insight into the workings of a police force and those who help and hinder justice.,1388880000,2,191,5.0

4662353,1,B005DVIOAO,Midsomer Murders this is not; 6 discs could have been 3 given the stupid plot turns... Bad police at its best. Old fart cops. Very few scenic views of Bristol and the seaside. Ugly police woman.,1380153600,,194,4.416666666666667
4662354,4,B005DVIOAO,"I watch a lot of British TV and police procedurals from both sides of the Atlantic, but I've seldom seen a series quite as compelling as ""Without Motive.""  Yes, there are some flaws in the production and the story, at times, can confuse, but I found myself racing through the 12 episodes wanting to know what would happen next.  Mistakes are made all around in the solving of a series of grisly crimes in Bristol and southern Wales.  The police often behave like headless chickens and office politics create confusion all around. Not only are there crime victims but the personal lives of the police officers are torn apart also.  It's a roller coaster ride from start to finish and will keep you guessing until the end.  That's a promise.  I could have used closed-captioning on this one but that's my only complaint.  Fasten your seatbelt and hang on because ""Without Motive"" is quite a ride.  Warning...the crime scenes are pretty graphic so this one isn't for the kids.",1377648000,,973,4.715976331360947
4662355,5,B005DVIOAO,"This is a don't miss-stunner.  Produced by Chris Kelly (of Kavanagh, Q.C.), it stars Ross Kemp as DC Jack Mowbray and Kenneth Cranham as his governor, DCS Derek Henderson.  They are investigating a series of brutal murders in Bristol and southern Wales.  The murderer drives a blue Peugeot and attacks his victims with a hammer and edged instrument.  Only one case (initially excluded) involves sexual violation.  The serial murders appear to be without motive.

The acting is nothing short of superb, the direction highly-skilled, the production values high.  This is gritty, serious drama with very little comic relief, but it is not difficult to watch.  On the contrary, it is riveting, since the private lives of several of the characters are explored at length.  In some of the later episodes the balance of drama to crime fiction becomes something like 80/20, as the tears flow, the eyes twitch and the circles around them grow deeper and darker.

This is the kind of thing that the Brits do so well; it is a real pity that the 12-part series is not better known in America.  I would rank this among the very best of the British crime dramas and urge those who delight in such work to check it out.

One caveat: once you start to watch this, you will have a great deal of difficulty stopping.  You will be sleep-deprived but deeply moved.  This is the real deal; enjoy it.",1352160000,,1378,4.6875
4662356,5,B005DVIOAO,"This one is more true to life than the average cop show. It takes six episodes to catch the killer. And in this one you can feel the desperation and frustration of the cops like in few dramas. It is about their lives as they have to deal with this. You get friends and neighbors criticizing them for not catching them. They have to do plodding work like check credit card statements at crime scenes. One detective is forced to retire as he bungles things a bit but it wasn't wholly his fault. In other words this is much more like what real cops go through and it's not glamorous or fast enough for the low raters. If you want superfast csi crime solving look elsewhere. This is down to earth and gritty. It features a great cast that carries this flick. It's not the typical cop show, (which I like) it's intead a taste of reality. Although it's reality in the year 2000 for the first series. And 2001 for the second. they are both in this set. At least we finally got this fine ITV DRAMA here on our shores in a beautiful dvd transfer. This was shot on hd film although the dvd is standard and not HD. So this looks really good on your tv as well. Like I said though , most people don't watch dramas about murders for a realistic show about how hard it is to solve some murders, and those people will want the other cop shows on dvd. I like both alot though. And this takes place in bristol , south eastern england , which adds a rural aspect to it. Real police would reconinze this show as truer to life than most shows and even the cops they see on this show probably. It's that good in that regard.",1342137600,2,1603,4.190938511326861
4662357,5,B005DVIOAO,"I agree with all the positive reviews on Without Motive and can't wait until Season 2 arrives, I hope.  I disagree that it is a soap opera; the mystery is full of suspense, good acting and a super plot.  I still haven't figured it out yet as I just finished the first half and would be finishing it now if my husband didn't want to see it as well. We are fans of the British mysteries and series and there have only been a few that didn't measure up.  Recommend it.  SUBTITLES included which are a must at our house.",1341619200,4,516,4.13
4662358,4,B005DVIOAO,"Detective Constable Jack Mowbray gives us a very realistic view of life of a Bristol UK police department. He and his colleagues are assigned to find the murderer of a young woman. Detectives from Wales show up asserting that this is their murder case, and it follows three other murders , a serial killer is on the loose. Political maneuvering keeps this case in Bristol, and for the next eleven episodes, we follow this group trying to solve the murders.

DCS Henderson is the bully in the china shop. He will go to every end to prove his fame by finding the murderer. One Perpetrator after another is assigned the murderer, mistakes are made, horrible decisions made and still the bodies pile up and the real murderer is on the loose.

We have time to examine DC Mowbray's homelife and how the tension and work 24/7 piles up and leaves its victims at home.
Jack 's homelife unravels and his wife,and children leave.  His colleagues are for the most part a good lot. But, one, in particular wants to get to the head of the class, and his interview techniques are horrible, breaking down an innocent man. The DCS does not have the leadership skills nor the imagination and intellect to lead an effective organization. Things fall apart often, and the team tries to pick them up.

This 12 set episode is superb. An inside look into the real lives of those on the front lines.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-20-12

8467638,2,B005DVIOAO,"While this series is, for the most part, well acted, there are some valid criticisms which can be leveled against this British TV show.

*** SPOILER ALERTS ***

At the end of Series 1 Jack correctly notes that there is little valid evidence which can link Bobby Jackson to the serial killings. Yet when Series 2 begins the viewer discovers, rather amazingly, that the jury somehow convicted Jackson of these crimes. Either Jackson had a terrible solicitor or the jury reacted viscerally rather than intellectually to what they had seen in court. Then at the end of Series 2 the viewer finds it rather jolting when the episode ends so abruptly. With a show like Trial and Retribution, for example, one finds how the trial went for the defendant. But in Without Motive the apparent assumption is that the court system will find the defendant guilty even though the police imprisoned the wrong man in Series 1. It would have been far better if the show had had another episode which showed the defendant being tried and whether or not the jury would find him guilty or innocent especially given the fact that detectives had broken into the killer's residence without a search warrant.",1468713600,,1181,4.784313725490196

8467643,5,B005DVIOAO,"I quite enjoyed this when it first aired on HTV (ITV Wales) in 2000 and 2001; but, its memory faded in my aging brain over the ensuing years and I forgot whodunit.  What a delight to watch it all again.
  Others have described the excellent cast;  they may not all be as beautiful as some would wish but that's part of what makes British programmes so marvellous -- actors with a normal appearance instead of cosmetically enhanced versions of Barbie and Ken.  I do want to mention Karl Johnson who plays Robert Jackson the accused killer; he gives a most bone-chilling performance as a psychotic.  Together with Tony Melody, who plays his father, they left me pondering what the future held for them after these series ended.  It would have made a great third season.  And, Jamie Foreman, as the detective Jim Boulter,  is again excellent as the slimy character we all have to tolerate at sometime.
  For those who worry, there's no bad language, not much sex, and not a lot of graphic violence -- there are scenes of the bloody bodies but, thankfully, not the murders.  It's rather tame by today's standards.
  It's a shame this series is not better known because it is one of the very best.",1427846400,8,1192,4.587677725118484
