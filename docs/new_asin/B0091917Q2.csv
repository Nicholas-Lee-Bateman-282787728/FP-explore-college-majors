8533917,4,B0091917Q2,"By no means an encyclopedia of camouflage techniques, it discusses the philosophy behind good camouflage while touching on some of the techniques. There is a lot of little phrases scattered throughout the piece. For example, he uses tall grass to apply stripes in a slapping motion.  This creates a natural effect which is far better than a blob from a thumb. It is worth paying attention to the dialog.

The video itself is in presentation format. The author presents dialog with supporting slides.  I found the tidbits about 'dead space' useful as well as discussion points about 'points of focus'.

It is about an hour long.  It's cheaper than gas money to get to a seminar.  And it is also something I can watch again.

Overall I was happy with what I received, both the DVD and the information it contained.",1453939200,,812,4.716312056737588
8533918,5,B0091917Q2,"Eddie Starnater is perhaps the best kept secret in the realm of outdoor skills.  He has an easy going nature, and a matter of fact straightforwardness when explaining a topic.  Having had the opportunity to take a couple of his classes in person, I welcomed the chance to have this DVD as a reference.  If you want to learn how to effectively disappear in a natural environment, this is the place to start.",1419120000,,406,4.534246575342466
