8324835,5,B0002PC2V8,"The Three Musketeers must be the best action novel ever written.  I had a chance to read Dumas's version in my early 20's and absolutely loved it.  But this interest first came from this cartoon, which was my favorite when I was a kid.  I was head over heels for Aramis!  I'm excited to share it with my kids today, as they seem really interested in the story as well.  I just really wish I could've found the French version, but unfortunately, it's only available in Europe on a different format.

Still, I absolutely recommend you purchase this DVD and share a great classic story with your kids, and made especially for them.  I hope you and your children will love it as much as I did (and still do!).  I also hope it will spark the interest to buy this great book for yourself.  If you really love the book, you will be happy to know there is more!  The Three Musketeers is followed by ""20 years later"" and ""The Vicomte de Bragelonne (in 3 books) where the movie ""The man with the iron mask"" partly came from.  Perhaps you will want to read more from Dumas: The Count of Monte Cristo, Queen Margot, etc.

In the meantime, I hope you and your children will enjoy this wonderful DVD!",1367798400,,1186,4.340909090909091
8324836,5,B0002PC2V8,"The Three Muskehounds.  Dogtanian.  I don't know.  I loved the story, loved the action, liked the extras, and so loved the experience.  The PAL format bothered me, but i had a way to watch it so I was fine about it.  I could find myself there in that world see the story unfold, like a fly on the wall.  I read the book it's based on (by Dumas),and I'm rather glad that it didn't follow the story exactly.  I would let my kids see it (if I had any).  Anyone who likes 80's animated genre(anime) and is into dogs should see this series.  The theme song is a little corny, but it is memorable.",1352937600,2,591,4.114035087719298
8324837,4,B0002PC2V8,"It is a very entertaining cartoon for kids.  There are some historical references that may spur the kids interest in history, etc.",1342051200,,130,4.909090909090909
8324838,5,B0002PC2V8,"This is an entertaining box-set, with an extremely catchy soundtrack, perfect for boys and girls age 5-10.  Grown-ups likewise will enjoy the stories and life-lessons while following Dogtanian and his many adventures.  An amazing value of high quality DVDs so much so that I am ordering a few more for gifts.  You won't regret this as it is a welcome change from so many other less-than-interesting kids cartoons. My son and daughter could not get enough of these.",1342051200,,464,4.923076923076923
8324839,5,B0002PC2V8,"My almost 7-year-old daughter watched this with a 3-year-old (boy) friend and they were both enthralled.  Great, exciting stories.  I'm always looking for good programming like this and I'm very happy she received this as a gift!",1341964800,,229,5.162162162162162
8324840,5,B0002PC2V8,My grandchildren LOVE this set.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is very entertaining and such fun.  I am planning on sending it to my friends for their grandchildren to enjoy.,1341878400,,185,4.71875
