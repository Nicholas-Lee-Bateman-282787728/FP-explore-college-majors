8226089,5,B000WYWORG,"The Teachers of The Secret DVDs are more teaching people the improtance action, what action can be taken and go to great length to teach what could be preventing us from taking the neccessary actions that we desire to, to get where we want to. And this is done very honestly, very powerfully, very lovingly. I have watched The Secret several times and have also watched The Teachers of The Secret DVDs twice now. I could not have made a better investment, at this time in my life, than this. These Teachers are the real thing and they honestly give their best. I actually have ended up feeling like I was in the hall together with the other people and actually do participate in the seminar interative bits. If anyone has anyone they know who really liked and appreciated The Secret, this could be the next best thing in that person's life that one could either gift them with or share with them. Thank you Rhonda, all the Teachers and Power Within for so great a sharing.",1194134400,3,972,4.497175141242938
