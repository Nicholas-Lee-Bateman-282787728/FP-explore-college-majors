8333129,3,B001PCNZFE,"Probably my own fault for not reading into the description of the DVD better.  However, I did not realize that any of the members of U2 were not involved in this biography.  I was highly disappointed that not one U2 song was used.  Again, probably my own fault but was not happy with this DVD!!!",1396137600,,295,4.327272727272727
8333130,2,B001PCNZFE,"A warning to anyone who is considering purchasing this DVD:  ""Bono: Big Daddy"" is nothing more than a repackaged and retitled version of a previous documentary called ""Bono: God's Favorite Son"".  The two programs are otherwise identical.  This is a typical unauthorized bio.  Because Bono and U2 were not involved, there is no U2 music.  While the description on the sleeve promises interviews with the ""friends and family members who know him best"", as far as I know, none of the journalists, radio DJs and record producers featured in this program are related to Bono by blood, marriage or otherwise.  Whether any of them would be considered among Bono's closest friends is debatable.  Some of the interviews are mildly interesting, but if you're expecting members of Bono's inner circle to reveal his deepest darkest secrets, you will be disappointed.  All in all, this might be a fairly entertaining rental, but it's certainly not worth the retail price.",1244160000,11,958,5.057324840764331
