7985065,5,B00008KA9J,"After viewing this on PBS, I believed it would be a good teaching tool for the Bible study class I teach.  It addressed many of the questions about Judaism my students asked and gave much better answers than I could.  I think it does much to promote understanding.",1361145600,,264,4.479166666666667
7985066,5,B00008KA9J,"I think that for some reason all religions coming from the Israelie book explaining the origins of mankind, what we call the [bible ( book )]  nowdays, are following the example of Lot's daughters and not the example of Ambraham,  Abraham was not one of the Israelie minorities called Jews,  real Jews such as Hillel aka Annel Aka Anius and his people were real Jews as was this person that the bible calls Emmanuel ( Jesus ),  all were decendents of Juda and the Jewish Israelie empire and not of the Semrian (Samerian ) 10 tribes that  made up  the 10 tribes of Israel aka Sameria Israel.  The intire political system between the two states were very different because the Levi klan joined the majority, the State of Sameria Israel,  leaving the minority Jews to come up with a new way to elect/appoint their ruling priestly people.",1324598400,,834,4.625850340136054
7985067,5,B00008KA9J,"This is a first rate film that raises many important theological issues.  I am not sure what the previous reviewer who was disappointed may have been expecting when he viewed this documentary, but a few clarifications are in order.  The film includes reflections from a wide array of Jews and Christians, none of whom may accurately be called ""secular.""  The Christian voices include not only Catholics, but also Episcopalian, United Church of Christ, and Lutheran.  The film raises the crucial theological question of whether or not the western Christian tradition has knowingly and also unwittingly fostered anti-semitism through questionable exegesis of scripture and a theology of supersessionism that works its way subtly into many aspects of Christian life, including popular Christmas hymns.  The various Christian voices--most of whom are clergy or very highly respected theologians and biblical scholars--seek to raise awareness of the history of anti-semitism, and to challenge Christians to discover the essentially Jewish foundation of the Christian tradition.  The film examines various local efforts of Jews and Christians to engage in bridge building.  The fimn does not offer a simplistic message of toleration. Instead, it squarely faces the many challenges to dialogue and mutual understanding.

I am a college professor and I have used this film for years as a teaching resource.  I have shown it to Christian College students several times as part of a religion class.  It has always succeeded in provoking deep relfection and discussion.  My students have profitted from it, and I suspect most viewers will also find it worthwhile if they allow themselves to reflect upon the troubling issues that the film raises.",1210809600,8,1735,5.388888888888889
7985068,3,B00008KA9J,"As an evangelical Christian I was expecting this video to be filled of great information. However, after watching it I was disappointed. I think it should be have been called ""Secular Jews & Catholics: A Journey of 'let's get along'.""",1185840000,4,234,4.875
7985069,5,B00008KA9J,"My position as an Episcopal Priest working as a Hospital Chaplain provides opportunities for me to relate to people of many different faiths or even of no faith.  If people are willing to have me support them in their illness or crisis, I am glad to offer the support with no strings attached. This often means helping them connect with their own faith tradition if it is something they desire.  My closest friend has been for many years a Rabbi in the Jewish Reformed Tradition. We met in third grade. I found watching ""Jews and Christians: A Journey of Faith,"" a stimulating, informative and profoundly moving experience.  Women and men from both tradions speak with an eloquence informed often by years of learned reflection on their own tradition and that of ""The Other"", whether this happens to be Jewish or Christian. The often painful history between these two groups is one of the issues that comes up for repeated comment and reflection. There are also recorded encounters between laity, clergy and representatives of each tradition--challenging, askings questions and getting misperceptions clarified.  For anyone for whom the ongoing relationship between Christians and Jews is a vital concern, ""Jews and Christians, a Journey of Faith"" is an invaluable resource.",1179532800,9,1274,5.140096618357488
