7821643,1,6302142377,"The basic idea for this story wasn't without some merit, but the length and breadth of it was weakly carried out.  An actress/singer (?) who seems to have everything is hopelessly caught up in prostitution because of her father who never gave her the attention or praise she needed.  She isn't making money; she is punishing herself because her father told her she was cheap.  So she is cheap.  She attempts to give dear old dad money to save his boat, but he refuses, and her self contempt continues.

Psychology films were just becoming vogue when this was made, so it is an attempt to explain deviant human behavior through childhood influences.  The loving fiance who is always there for her is tiring (especially when she always comes in from her ""work"" and takes a bath), and her constant return to the same hotel room until she is discovered and abused by the managers is not only pitifully slow in coming but weakens the idea that a person living two existences can get away with it for a long time.  If the slow plot and repeated stupidity aren't enough, there is a lesbian wanna-be lover who hangs around until opportunity allows her to present the option that is temporarily considered, then rejected.  I discarded the film.",1230336000,,1235,4.685185185185185
