535377,1,6303036813,"I love the first Aladdin,but I thought this squel was a dumb! Jafar gets out of the lamp by a thief and Jafar's parrot partner,Iago joins Aladdin and his frends. Iago turns good! That was a big mistake. The first Aladdin movie was the best of them all. The only thing I like about this movie is my favorite character,Genie! This movie has 5 new songs but I don't care for them. The animation is okay,but this is one of the worst squels ever made. The worst mistake was making Iago good. Disney can do much better! SKIP RETURN OF JAFAR AND ALADDIN AND KING OF THIEVES.THEY BOTH STINK.JUST SEE THE ORIGINAL ALADDIN!",998611200,,613,4.433628318584071
535378,5,6303036813,"I've read all the reviews here on Amazon.com about this film,& i don't agree with most if any of them. This was Disney's first direct-to-video sequel & it still stands as their best. ""The Return Of Jafar"" is one of those films either you love or you hate & i very much love this film,it's not only my favorite Disney film but it's my favorite film of all-time. The film has Jafar going after those who did him wrong(Aladdin,Jasmine,Genie, Abu ect.)My favorite part of the film has to be where Jafar & Genie go one on one & Jafar comes out the winner!!! If you haven't guessed by now Jafar is my favorite character. Now this is of course a sequel to ""Aladdin"" but not only that it was also the starting point for the ""Aladdin"" t.v. series the first four episodes. My rating for the film is 5 out of 5 Stars...If your an ""Aladdin"" fan this is a must see film.",986428800,2,857,4.263803680981595
535379,1,6303036813,"This is one of the worst sequels, Disney or otherwise, that I have ever seen. I get the impression that Disney only made this sequel not to have a  great movie about Aladdin fighting Jafar, but to let Iago join Aladdin's  side so they could do a T.V. series, more merchandising, and other stuff.  (In other words to make more money.)The only song I thought was good was  Jafar's, ""You're only second rate,"" that was sung to Genie. The  other songs were boring and drab. The animation was quick, sketchy, jerky  and downright bad. The story itself, which was somewhat feasible  sequel-wise, had been poorly thought out and the whole thing reminded me of  the cheap Saturday morning cartoons done in the 70's. Robin Williams  couldn't (or perhaps wouldn't) return to do Genie's voice in this one, but  the man who does Genie's voice instead started off okay, but then loses how  to do the voice halfway through which is quite noticable. The whole movie  was pretty corny, espically at the end, and I don't know of anyone who  likes it. I believe even Disney is embarressed by it because they don't  seem to show it as much on the Disney Channels as much as they do their  other movies. I like Iago and Gilbert Godfrey does a fine job playing him.  If you like Iago as well then you might like to watch this just to see him,  (He has more screen time than Jafar.) This is definatly a renter not a  buyer.",968025600,3,1401,4.448818897637795
535380,2,6303036813,"You would think that the sequel to ALADDIN would resolve the cliffhanger of the first film and be just as entertaining and memorable at the same time?  Well, you may find yourself a little disappointed.
THE RETURN OF  JAFAR does tie up loose ends, but the animation and overall plot are almost  lifeless.  One or two of the songs are good.  But it is mainly the  performances of some of the film's stars that are able to keep the action  flowing, including the return of Gilbert Gottfried as Iago the parrot.  But  Robin Williams, who was at odds with Disney at the time, is missed as the  voice of the Genie.  I'm not sure if he would have been able to improve on  the weak premise of this sequel, but it probably would've helped it earn at  least one or two more stars.
THE RETURN OF JAFAR is recommended only to  those who liked ALADDIN enough to want to collect the entire trilogy.",962841600,2,885,4.3496932515337425
535381,1,6303036813,"ALADDIN is one of Disney's truly outstanding achievements.  This one stands out for and marks an achievement, too.  The achievement?  THE RETURN OF JAFAR is a total washout, laking everything I once knew ALADDIN movies  to have.
One of the best things about this movie is that you get to be  reunited with characters who've already won your hearts in ALADDIN.  It is  a joy to see them again if you have watched the first movie over and over  and over and over and over and over.
But I was very disappointed in their  new adventures.  We find Jafar, now an all-powerful geenie, plotting a  revenge on Aladdin and friends. And might I point out that this plot is age  old, and that it has been used countless times without twists.  Other plots  are used over and over but they have twists to make new versons appealing.  The only twist here is that Iago is attempting to switch sides in the  ""battle"" between Aladdin and Jafar.  Also, as another reviewer  pointed out, the characters have changed quite a bit, and it was not  amusing to find them different than when they debuted.  Also, the music is  junk compared to ""A Whole New World"", ""Prince Ali"", and  ""Friend Like Me"" from the first film.  Also, the lack of Robin  Williams (who voiced Geenie in the first film and would later return to  voice him in the third) made a big difference and it showed.  This new  Geenie didn't even come CLOSE to amusing me. Also, this movie had a scary  theme to it whenever Jafar showed up.  Scarier than in the first, even. And  Jafar's idiot master, Abis Mahl, isn't even funny and is a very poor  villian.  The ending was also a great disappointment compared with the  fireworks and music and group hug at the end of ALADDIN.
To sum it up, if  you want to see these characters at their best, see ALADDIN, not this  trash.  I am a Disney lover, but this is absolute trash.  The only reason  I'm proud I have it is because it's part of the ALADDIN trilogy.  I am  highly disappointed in Disney's performance.  When I saw the trailer on THE  FOX AND THE HOUND and such, I thought Disney would make a better sequel.  I  guess I cannot make guesses about Disney anymore. I said in my review of  ALADDIN that Walt would be proud of it, and he would be, but he would NOT  be proud of this trash.",961718400,3,2280,4.359712230215828
535382,4,6303036813,"Since this was one of my favortie childhood movies, and every review here has given it a bad rap, I feel entitled to speak up.  First of all, this was _not_ four back-to-back Aladdin cartoon episodes. This movie was  divided up into four segments, and had commercials inserted into it before  being viewed on television, but it was not a TV cartoon first. Second of  all, yes, I agree that Robin Williams was the best Genie of all, but the  Disney budget was not about to stretch enough to hire him for a small,  direct-to-video sequel; not to mention all the TV cartoons that followed.  Dan did the best he could as Genie . . . and keep in mind that Robin  Williams is a tough act to follow. And look, I'll admit that the animation  was fairly poor in comparison to the original, the songs were not as  stunning, and all that other stuff, but the movie itself was interesting. I  _love_ characters that start out cynical and ""evil"" and who start  to learn about honor and friendship and love, and end up doing things they  never thought they'd do. These kinds of characters are great to write about  (I like writing short stories), and are fun to watch on movies, too. Iago  learns what it means to be loyal, going so far as to be willing to give up  his life for his friends. And I'll admit, it's strange to see a talking  parrot go through severe emotional personality changes. But hey, it worked  out alright.  So give this film a chance. ""You'd be surprised what you  can live through."" (Hey, by reading some of these other reviews, that  might be all you could hope for at the end of this film. But you may be  surprised!)",946425600,7,1628,4.374581939799331

535462,4,6303036813,"I have to say first of all, that I do agree when people criticize the animation and production quality of the film. That's just a fact. I'm also as disappointed as the next guy about Genie not being Robin Williams.

HOWEVER, I love the story. I'm a sucker for a redemption story, and my favorite kinds of characters are the loud-mouthed sometimes-jerks that are really good deep down. Something interesting that a lot of people don't know about Iago is that Jafar transferred all of his emotions into him so he could focus better on his magic (source: http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp53. The. Rules.html, just use Ctrl F and search for ""Iago""), and that's why Iago always bursts out in anger. But is this also why Iago was able to be able to turn around deep down, while Jafar was not? It's a very interesting way to look at it. From here on out, Iago was a regular staple to the series, and it would be very different without his anti-hero contrast. He adds flavor to the main cast of heroes.

As a side note, I think Gilbert Gottfried singing is hilarious, and therefore find both of the songs he sings (""I'm Looking Out for Me"" and ""Forget About Love"") are very enjoyable, if not particularly beautiful.",1449964800,,1210,4.649532710280374

Iago becomes a good character in this film, and his song is pretty good, too. Aladdin and Jasmine are just as interesting as they were in the first film. Major flaw! I could have sworn Robin Williams was playing the Genie, but no, They got Home Simpson to do the voice instead! The new actor playing the Genie sounded a little like Robin Williams and a weaker version of Home Simpson at the same time, I still liked how he was funny at times, but it's just not the same without Robin Williams. The songs were not as good as the ones from the original, but I still liked some of them. The animation wasn't as good, either.

They didn't even try to make it a theatrical release due to time (it was done on the cheap and it shows).  It didn't help that Robin Williams was peeved with ill-treatment from the first film, refusing to reprise the role of the genie.  He was replaced by Dan Castellaneta, a poor substitute (and it shows).  They also replaced the voice of the Sultan with another knockoff.  The plot isn't much, Jafar returns and tries to wreck havoc, again.  They gave the parrot a song to `sing' and it isn't memorable, although appropriate: ""I'm Looking Out for Me.""  Jason Alexander shows up as the thief Abis Mal and doesn't even bother to give a voice to the character other than his own.  They try to execute Aladdin (always a jolly plot ploy in a children's cartoon!), by chopping off his head.  Aladdin and Jasmine decide to travel rather than get married.

535828,5,6303036813,"I loved the hell out of both the THE RETURN OF JAFAR and THE KING OF THIEVES. I still have my original VHS copies that I got when they were released back in 94 & 96. I was just a kid than I am 27 years old now so you do the math. I admit the THE RETURN OF JAFAR and THE KING OF THIEVES are both pieces of crap. Especially THE RETURN OF JAFAR. However aside from the advertisement on the packaging niether movie gives us any illusions that they think they are superior to the original ALADDIN. Both movies are just 100% pure dumb fun. However THE KING OF THIEVES came really close in matching the quality of the origial in terms  of plot and character develeopment yes believe it or not Aladdin and his father undergo terrific character development, and theres great chemistry between Aladdin and his father. However the animation and songs inTHE KING OF THIEVES ars just as crappy as in THE RETURN OF JAFAR. The exceptions are the sequences with The Oracle, The Vanishing Isle and The Golden Hand of Midas. and the the scene where Aladdin follows the FORTY THIEVES back to thier lair and THE KING OFTHIEVES streches forth his hand and dramatically shouts OPEN SESEME and he parts the ocean like Moses parted the Red Sea. Those sequences were animated brilliantly and they matched the quality of the original. Now on to THE RETURN OF JAFAR yes the movie wasa piece of crap everything about it was awful. However it is my strong belief that watching a crappy movie once in while is good for the soul and just because THE RETURN OF JAFAR and THE KING OF THIEVES are crappy that doesnt stopme from loving them both as much as I love the original. There were two scenes in THE RTETUR OF JAFAR that were animated briliantly and thier action seqences ere epic. The scene where Jafar and Abis-Mal kidnap The Sultan on flying horses and the final battle between Aladdin and Jafar where  Jafar opens the ground and a volcano erupts the lava looks real not quite as good as the lava in The Cave of Wonders still the animation in those sequences were awesome. In fact those two sequences are the only parts where the animation is outstanding that said these movies  are not for everyone but if your into really crappy movies like I am than your in for a real treat. WARNING BOTH THESE MOVIES ARE CRAPPY DISENGAGE BRAIN BEFORE WATCHING EITHER OF THESE MOVIES OR YOU  MAY SUFFER A STROKE OR ANUERISM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY SUCK IN COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINAL",1409270400,,2450,4.44988864142539

535879,3,6303036813,"Ok so the animation isn't the greatest. But people are expecting too much. First of all Disney didn't start making sequel's hard core until Aladdin! SO yes they had lessons to learn. This is not as awful as people say. I LOVE the song ""Forget about Love"" thats the big highlight of hte movie on the songs.

I love that Iago turns good! I adore it!  I am glad Jafar dies...because lets face it he can't be in every single movie they need new bad guys. I think while the animation lacks the brilliant colors and flow of the original, this still has something to give audiences, a redeamed Iago is better and funnier than an evil Iago. So please sit back and enjoy and keep in mind that this movie basically rocketed on their sequels. So yes they were learning new things about animation companies to use. Despite what you all think its not the same studio that does it every time. They hire out. I know this because I was an animation student and I also knew someone who worked that way on The Little Mermaid 2! So with that said, they obviously made a poor choice on who to hire here! So again give them a break and just enjoy more of Aladdin and Jasmine's mushy sweet moments. I adore it...even if this sequel sometimes annoyed me when I was younger. It had to do with the fact that I didn't understand how movie studios are picked for such things.

Enjoy",1406505600,,1355,4.326771653543307

535929,4,6303036813,"""The Return of Jafar"" has gotten something of a bad rap over the years, for a couple reasons:  One, it was the official start of the made-for-video Disney sequels, many of which were unnecessary and all of which were lower in animation quality than the theatrical movies.  And two, a second sequel, ""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" came out a couple years later that was largely claimed as superior of the two.

But I'm here to say that ""Return of Jafar"" is underrated.  Is it as exceptional as the 1992 film?  No.  But it feels like a necessary sequel in that (spoilers!) Jafar wasn't truly killed at the end of the first film, and it was interesting seeing what kind of threat he'd pose when given a new master.  And I liked how nobody wants to believe that former henchman Iago has truly changed for the better; it's a good character-driven story about reputations and trust, and it worked.  If I had to make a criticism, it's that the film feels unevenly paced; the first half is more talky and musical, while the second half is pretty much one big action scene.  The first Aladdin film had a better flow to it.

Overall though, I liked the film for what it was.  The songs, while not 1992 quality, were pretty catchy (especially ""Forget About Love""), the animation, while basically TV budget, was still high quality, and y'know what?  I'll just say it:  Dan Castellaneta gets an unfair rap for his Genie.  Is he Robin Williams?  No, few are, but he put his own unique vocal spin on the character and I had few problems with him in this film and the TV series.

How can I rate Disney movies,but great entertainment. Even without Robin Williams the story line and quality is great",1354665600,,165,5.6
536074,3,6303036813,"The general worldly consensus on Disney sequels - which are basically cheap, inexpensive, relatively lame movies that were whipped together by second rate minds in Disney, purely for making a few quick bucks - are this: they suck. To be blunt, it's not that terribly far off. It doesn't take quite a lot of intelligence or perceptiveness to understand just how unimpressive they can be, unless you are a little child and, to be fair, don't have quite an understanding of the fine line between good and down-right blowing. While it seems harsh, given that the targeted audience are the very children I just described, it's true; being an apt critic is realizing just how bad some things are.

Aladdin is, in some ways, not a stranger to this. From a childish, fanboy, and a critical perspective, Aladdin worked because not only was it so damn funny, it was well done and well written. Granted, it is a cheap 90's knockoff of a 'get rich quick and look good at it' scenario, but the characters and the music were so interesting you kind of looked over that. So, after the massive success of that multi-million dollar film, it only makes sense to make a smaller, inexpensive, and professional sequel, riiiiight? Well... yes and no. An Aladdin TV series, in 1994, had been scheduled to premiere and already had a three-parter pilot set up for it. However, the Disney executives believed that the pilot they had planned could accurately run has a full 69-minute movie.

Therefore, all three parts run consistently; and this is The Return of Jafar. Return of Jafar is not bad by any means, but by no means is it terrific either. The animation is sloppy - and by that I mean god damn sloppy - the story can get paper-thin at times, and it's too short for its own good. At 69 minutes, you'd expect a film plot such as Jafar's epic return (as a Genie, mind you) would at least be longer than slightly over an hour. Because of this, things move far too fast for its own good, despite clearly having potential to be ultimately better, and it shows. There's odd moments of interlacing, terrible animation shifts and changes, often times the facial textures are messed up considerably, and while the backgrounds can be very colorful, they often times just end up being a bit too boring for their own good.

Return of Jafar pretty much re-hashes the idea Aladdin run on, but did add a few good and bad. Jafar was banished as a new Genie at the climatic, fifteen-minute end of the first movie. He wants revenge, but that comes with a cost. His former partner, the wisecracking, obnoxious Iago (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried) ends up betraying the narrow-faced, witty guy, squawking a litany of rebellion after throwing Jafar's lamp down a well. The film mostly revolves around these two ideas, with Jafar getting revenge, and Iago's redemptive journey.

And when I say these two are the main characters, I mean they are the main characters. Everyone else is so underdeveloped they might as well be background characters. Iago is at least given a more sympathetic light here; he ends up betraying Jafar for his own interests at first, but then warms up to the idea of friendship with Aladdin. But then Jafar returns AGAIN, and Iago has to betray them again. Despite this, Iago's still pretty damn annoying, despite the fact that he's given a lot of weight here. Jafar, is, in some ways, improved upon in the second film. Jafar was known for his distinct features, his magic, and whatnot, and here they considerably grasped it. Almost all of Jafar's scenes contrast sharply with the overall attitude of Aladdin, and they do it very well; from his sharp lines, his evil plots, and facial expressions, there's rarely a bad moment with the rechristened guy.

Everyone else, though, is pretty boring. Jafar's new sidekick, a greedy, Jason Alexander-voiced criminal named Abis Mal (god, terrible joke), is somewhat interesting due to the VERY Seinfeld-like humor (that's no coincidence), but he's just not strong enough. Aladdin mostly serves as the punching-bag; in the course of 69 minutes, he's thrown off a waterfall, nearly breaks up with Jasmine, has his life nearly taken from him twice, good gravy do they throw him through the ringer. Genie (now voiced by the sub-par Dan Castellanata, who just doesn't do a good job compared to Williams) performs one song, and then does nothing for the rest of the film. And I seriously hate whoever developed Jasmine; while her personality is still up to par, the animation has turned her face into a nightmare.

Music-wise, however, The Return of Jafar is just as groovealicious and catchy as the first film (though slightly less so). Iago gets a solo number by the title of ""I'm Looking Out For Me""... ooooookay. The melody is catchy and the instrumentation is a funky 4/4, but whoever thought their idea of a showstopping musical number was Gilbert Gottfried singing was good... yeahhhh. Things do pick up from here, though. The Genie's song, ""Nothing In The World"", while not in the rapid pace of the first film's song for him, is amusing and has a funky rhythm. ""Forget About Love"" is more than likely the film's best known number; following a jazz rhythm, Iago leads... again in a few verses (cause we all know Gottfried is such a damn good singer), singing about how Jasmine is better off without Aladdin, but actually using reverse psychology (yeah, it sounds stupid, but it is vaguely amusing); it picks up once the aforementioned Princess and her boyfriend join in for a peculiar triplet. Lastly, we have Jafar's solo song, ""You're Only Second Rate""; despite the fact that it is just smack-talk, it's by far and away the film's best number; it's fast-paced, very catchy, contains good orchestration, and has decent lyrics. (Sans for two particularly annoying lines which are evident)

The Return of Jafar isn't bad - it's story does have some good twists, in particular during the second half of the movie, good music, and the two villains (well, one villain-turned-hero) are very well portrayed. It's simply not as strong as Aladdin, especially in the animation department. Despite its evident energy, after the first few times, it doesn't hold up to par with the first movie's ideas. But, it's not bad, and I guess that's all that matters. Maybe.",1347753600,,6279,4.797597042513863
536075,3,6303036813,"This film is okay at best.  They say that typical sequels are a lot weaker than the original, which in this case this is exactly the case.  I thought it'd be a lot better than it was.  Disappointing.  Buyer beware.",1343001600,,214,4.275
536076,2,6303036813,"The Disney DTV sequels have a reputation for being substandard.  That's not entirely fair; for example, Cinderella III is a very well done sequel that captures the spirit of the original movie, with high production values.  They're not all bad; perhaps the Disney DTV sequels are kind of like Star Trek movies (watch the even numbered ones, avoid the odd numbered ones).  But then there are movies like ""Return of Jafar.""

The animation is shoddy in parts, with Saturday morning quality strewn throughout.  As my wife pointed out, Jasmine looks about 45 in a number of scenes.  Poor Dan Castellanata does his very best to be Genie, but you just can't replace a voice and comic sensibility as unique as Robin Williams.  I love Gilbert Gottfried, who is very funny in his own unique way.  However, he is the last person in the world who should be required to carry not just one, but two different songs within this movie.  Iago is a good character, but was there really a demand for a sequel to Aladdin that focused on his character arc and that required him to sing?

All of that could have been overcome with a good story.  Instead, there is a continuity-free mess that doesn't even hang together internally, much less make any sense in conjunction with the original Aladdin.  Fortunately, it's short so at least it's over soon.

The 5 and under set will not notice the problems with this movie and will enjoy it quite a bit.  That's the only reason I give it the second star: that age group will think it's a 5 star blockbuster.  The 6 and ups, and the parents, probably will not enjoy it nearly as well.  Avoid if possible.  The next sequel, ""King of Thieves,"" is not perfect either, but is substantially better; try to focus your youngsters on that one if they ask for this awful misfire of a movie.",1336608000,,1802,4.56386292834891

536078,5,6303036813,"You remember the Disney muscial classic Aladdin. Remember how Jafar was defeated by being sealed in his own  magic lamp by Aladdin and thrown into the desert by Genie. Well, as they say in every good film, you can't keep a spectacular villain down. As the title states, Jafar returns to Agrabah to exact his revenge on Aladdin and the others, and resume his plans for complete domination over the land.

Over the years I have heard many people complain about this film usually stating that it is inferior to the orginal movie/prequel. I say different. Although they could have done much better with the animation, the rest of the film (characters, storyline and the music) is just as potent as ever. Genie is hilarious (despite Robin Williams not making his own return for the role), the relationship between Aladdin and Jasmine remains strong and dramatic, and (what I found to be the most entertaining) Iago abandons Jafar early on in the film and does his best to be a hero.

As for the songs (every Disney film has to have some, right? It wouldn't be Disney otherwise), we have 'Nothing In The World' as Genie comes hom after travelling the planet but feeling a little lonely, 'I'm Lookin' Out For Me' as Iago leaves Jafar to go off on his own, 'We Can't Forget About Love' as Genie and Iago campaign to bring Aladdin and Jasmine back together after a misunderstanding, and the best of the lot, 'You're Only Second Rate', which is Jafar's villain song (FINALLY; they missed that in the first film).

So, can Aladdin and co. defeat Jafar a second time, or is that sorcerer turned most-powerful-Genie-of-all going to get the best of them once and for all. The heroes are going to have put out all the stops on this one, let me tell you. Especially Iago. Well, what are you waiting for? Here is your chance. Take it and witness...

As far as Disney's direct to video sequels are concerned this is one of the shortest ones. Also this movie has the distinction as well as being the first direct to video sequel. This time around Aladdin and Genie are reduces to being supporting actors while Iago is the lead actor or bird in this film. The movie starts with a group of thieves returning to their hideout after their latest plunder. Aladdin and Abu arrive to steal the treasures back and disperse it among the poor people of Agrabah. In the next scene we see Iago, along with Jafar's lamp, freeing himself from the Cave of Wonders. Iago drops Jafar's lamp down a well because he is unhappy with the way he was treated by him and flies off to Agrabah. Once in Agrabah, Iago heads to the palace and tries to trick Aladdin into accepting him in to his home. Aladdin is not fooled by this and chases Iago into the market and once in the market the two meet Abis Mal and his men. Abis Mal and his men chase Aladdin in the market and corner him. Iago accidently save Aladdin and Aladdin takes him back to the palace and puts Iago into a bird cage.

 Later on the Genie enters the movie after having traveled the world and reunites with Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. Genie arrives just in time as the Sultan is to announce that Aladdin is to become the new Grand Vizier. At dinner and after the Sultan has made the announcement, Iago enters the room being chased by Rajah, this makes the Sultan and Jasmine very upset. Later that evening Abis Mal and his men are by the same well where Iago dumped Jafar's lamp. Abis Mal unintentionally pulls up the lamp from the well and frees Jafar from the lamp. However, Jafar is bound by the rules of the lamp and must give Abis Mal his three wishes. Jafar tricks Abis Mal into wasting two of his wishes and the two strikes a bargain; if Abis Mal helps Jafar gets his revenge on the people who imprison him then he will give Abis Mal his third wish. From there the plot line is very simple. The two make it back to Agrabah and Jafar forces Iago to go along with his plans. Iago tricks Aladdin into taken the Sultan on a carpet ride to a place above a waterfall where the two can smooth things out. Jafar emerges in the palaces gardens and captures Genie, Abu, and Jasmine. At the waterfall Abis Mal and Jafar captures the Sultan and carpet.

Aladdin makes it back to the palace only to be thrown in a cell to behead the next mooring for the murder on the Sultan. He is to die the next morning by the orders of the Princess; actually Jafar in disguise. Iago frees the Genie and Genie saves Aladdin from having his head chop off in the nick of time and Genie also save the others as well.

 Genie tells the group that the only way to bring down Jafar is to destroy his lamp. The gang set out to steal and then destroy the lamp. The gang is seen by Jafar and the battle begins for the lamp. During the battle Jafar opens the ground and it is filled with magma trapping Genie, Abu, Jasmine, and Aladdin. Iago flies and a grabs the lamp but Jafar injures Iago during the battle. Iago, with what strength he has left, kick the lamp into the magma and thus destroying Jafar. In the end Abis Mal does not get his third wish. As far a direct to video sequels goes, this is one of the better ones in my opinion. There is one major goof in the movie though; in the last scenes in the Aladdin movie, Genie is given his freedom and the golden shackles are removed. In the Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves the golden shackles return. The Return of Jafar gets an AAA+++.

At the waterfall Abis Mal and Jafar captures the Sultan and carpet.

Aladdin makes it back to the palace only to be thrown in a cell to behead the next mooring for the murder on the Sultan. He is to die the next morning by the orders of the Princess; actually Jafar in disguise. Iago frees the Genie and Genie saves Aladdin from having his head chop off in the nick of time and Genie also save the others as well.

 Genie tells the group that the only way to bring down Jafar is to destroy his lamp. The gang set out to steal and then destroy the lamp. The gang is seen by Jafar and the battle begins for the lamp. During the battle Jafar opens the ground and it is filled with magma trapping Genie, Abu, Jasmine, and Aladdin. Iago flies and a grabs the lamp but Jafar injures Iago during the battle. Iago, with what strength he has left, kick the lamp into the magma and thus destroying Jafar. In the end Abis Mal does not get his third wish. As far a direct to video sequels goes, this is one of the better ones in my opinion. There is one major goof in the movie though; in the last scenes in the Aladdin movie, Genie is given his freedom and the golden shackles are removed. In the Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves the golden shackles return. The Return of Jafar gets an AAA+++.

536129,3,6303036813,"The movie itself was fine; the only problem that my boyfriend and I had was that it took over the amount of business days it stated it would take to arrive.  On Amazon.com, I was given a couple different expected due dates.  It ended up dragging out over 10-12 business days.  That was fine, but it would have been nice to have the movie sooner, especially because it WAS a belated Christmas gift.  Other than that, everything else was great!",1264377600,,442,4.4875
536130,2,6303036813,"Do you like showtunes?  How about showtunes sung by Gilbert Gottfried who is responsible for the voice of Iago?  He makes Danny Devito sound like Luciano Pavarotti.  Whoever wrote this movie obviously wanted to write broadway musicals but got stuck writing a low budget, sequel that Disney apparently quickly churned out to make a few extra bucks.

Unless you are a fan of big bands, showtunes, and terrible singing by a ghastly cartoon parrot, I say avoid this movie at all costs.  Stick to Aladdin part I!

This movie does have many features, such as awful singing, annoying big bands with Jaffar and Iago dancing around and singing in their cartoonish, distorted voice.  I issue you this stern warning, if you buy this movie for your kids, they will watch it again and again, and you will unwittingly and gradually LEARN the words to about a dozen poorly written show tunes with Gilbert Gottfried of all people shrieking out the lyrics.",1263686400,,939,4.795031055900621

536137,3,6303036813,"Jafar was an awesome villain, but would he REALLY choose to come back for a sequel if he knew he was going to look like a silly, fanged phantom who disguises himself as Jasmine, sings showtunes and says things like: ""I'll say goodbye to your boyfriend, Princesssss!""

I'm guessing not.

Although Jafar is still smashing, he's scripted badly. Jonathan Freeman is an extremely talented voice actor, particularly with this psychotic sorcerer, but Jafar was never a goof. And ""granny's gonna grab ya!"" just doesn't seem like something he'd say. So with Jafar, acting all strange, one must look to the other characters in the movie.

Aladdin still lies, and is still obnoxious. Jasmine is stupid. She is portrayed as very, VERY submissive and idiotic. Genie is dumb. In the first movie, he was cheesy in a good way, but here, he tries to steal everyone's shine and just comes off as a buffoon.

You end up feeling sorry for all of these characters who you loved so much in the last film.

Iago (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried) is the only shining thing, really. I mean, he stayed in character. He is bitter, rude, crass, and hilarious-- every bit as hilarious as he was in the first movie.

Abis Mal, the thief (voiced by Jason Alexander), is pretty dang funny, too, sometimes, 'cause he's such a schmo. But the movie just isn't good quality. There are several obvious mistakes, some inking errors, and more than a few misplaced lines.

There are continuity errors- Aladdin is still in his street clothes, Genie still wears his restraints... And there are a few head-scratchers, like, why everyone is so enraged that Iago is back, and how he is such a traitor.. I mean, he is a parrot.

""Return"" takes ""Aladdin"" too seriously, and the insanity was one of the reasons why ""A"" was so much fun.

Watch, but don't expect great things.",1213574400,3,1822,4.70440251572327

536139,3,6303036813,"Aladdin's (Scott Weinger) life is going well.  Living in the palace suits him, and he has turned his skills as a thief into a Robin Hood act.

Unfortunately, things are about to get messy.  Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) and Iago (Gilbert Gottfried) have managed to get out of the Cave of Wonders.  Jafar has one thing on his mind, revenge, and he wants to get back to Agrabah as quickly as possible.  His luck improves when his lamp falls into the hands of Abis Mal, the thief (Jason Alexander).

Iago wants to get back into the palace himself.  When he accidentally gets on Aladdin's good side, things seem to be going well.  But then Jafar shows up.  Whose side is Iago really on?  And is there a way to fight an all powerful genie?

This was the beginning of Disney's direct to video sequels.  I must admit, I enjoyed it the first few times I saw it, but it doesn't hold up.  The animation is far inferior to the original.  A couple of the songs are catchy, but they aren't in the same league as the songs from the original at all.  The story is decent, although I hate what it did to the ending of the original.  That ending was just perfect, so bring Jafar back so easily didn't make me happy.  I'm also not a fan of Aladdin lying again so easily.  Dan Castellaneta steps into the role of the Blue Genie, and he does a good job in Robin Williams' absence.  The story is decent, but it is darker and potentially scarier to young kids.

This isn't a bad film, but it pales in comparison to the original.",1194307200,7,1501,4.292857142857143

536192,2,6303036813,"I just purchased the video today, and I'm sad to say that it was a huge dissapointment. The first thing that caught my eye was that the animation lacked the elegance present in the first movie. Very ''Saturday-morning-cartoon-like''. That aside, the plot was remarkably weak. I kept waiting for the ''BOOM'' to come in. It didn't. Another huge dissapointment were the songs, wich had no meaning for me, it seemed as if they were just written in to prolong the movie. I definately think this sequel could have been done better, but that's just my opinion.",1124064000,,554,4.78125
536193,3,6303036813,"I like the sequel to ALADDIN only because the superb Jonathan Freeman (Jafar) is present - and he gets a song. Robin Williams is not present (but I know why - - -), the animation is quite a contrast to the amazing original, and the songs aren't any good (except Jafar's song . ..). Good thing Menken didn't write any of these songs! But, I had totally forgotten that Jason Alexander voices Abis Mahl (sp?). I still like ALADDIN AND THE KING OF THIEVES because Williams is back in, but no Jafar (darnit).

Bringing Jafar back seemed like some sort of cop-out - as if there were no other villans or adventures to chase.  It played out like a gigantic episode from the TV series (which I also remember watching, but not with any kind of fervor.)

Iago plays a MAJOR role in the movie! This movie really lets Iago be a deeper character than in the first movie(which also rules!) Sure, the animation was cheap, and the songs were a little silly, but it IS a direct-to-video movie, so I'm not going to nail Disney too hard about it.

Yes it does suck that the Ginie is someone else, AND WHAT happend to the orginl voice of my all time favorit villain!?!? did he die or something??? if so I don't know of......
  Yes the movie focus's on Jafar witch is the tittle and this time in my opion we see a darker and cureler side to Jafar.
 But despite several other peoples sayings turning yago a good guy and makeing him more humerius but still makeing him hate doing other stuff was a very good idea.... But I think ""Return of Jafar"" was just something to tell the fate of Jafar and take up the space inbeetwen Aladan and The King of thevs.  But I think we could have done without Reutrn of Jafar keep him burried in the sand and get yago to some how escape, but we would have all wondered what happend to Jafar is they didn't make one!
 I cant honestly see why this wasent a theatical realse
