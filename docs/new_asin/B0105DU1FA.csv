8721391,5,B0105DU1FA,"These easy-to-learn Chi Kung exercises (with two exceptions) are done sitting down.  All of them are easy to learn.  I have multiple health problems, specifically arthritis and half-a-dozen back diagnoses that make mobility difficult.  I have been practicing these exercises for a month, now, and I am feeling much better and stronger.  I postponed rotator cuff surgery for too long, resulting in loss of some function in one arm.  It is getting better, thanks to this DVD.
Dr. Eng explains the purpose of each exercise carefully and patiently.
There are 24 different exercises and I only do four each day.  They are a great way to start every day!
My only negative comments are that (1) this is not a high-definition video and the picture is a little grainy - and (2) there are some points where the music almost makes it hard to hear Dr. Eng's explanations.
Still, it is easy to follow and understand.  I recommend any/all of Roger D. Hagood's books and DVD's to anyone seeking better health or martial arts expertise.",1492387200,,1020,4.7942857142857145
