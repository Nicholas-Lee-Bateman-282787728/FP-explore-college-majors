8278079,4,B001AN2HCK,"After years of watching a well-worn VHS version of Chicken Ranch, I was delighted to find that Broomfield had released it on DVD. So I bought this box set, mostly for Chicken Ranch but also because I liked Fetishes. Heidi Fleiss was interesting at the time but she's not as fascinating to me now.

Nick Broomfield provides introductions for all three films. The intros and interesting and informative.

Chicken Ranch also has a director's commentary. This alone makes the the box set worth the price. Chicken Ranch also contains a documentary about the first half of Bloomfield's career.

However, Fetishes and Heidi Fleiss lack any commentary. I also wish that the films had been restored. Chicken Ranch is almost 30 years old and is showing its age. The image is much like that of the VHS version.

But despite the disappointing image quality, and lack of commentaries, I would recommend this box set to any fan of Broomfield's work.",1254614400,6,935,4.861635220125786
