Too often, in multiracial duos, the man of color is rendered secondary.  Most people don't remember Jim, they remember Huck Finn.  Tonto is a sidenote to the Lone Ranger.  There was a documentary that said either Lewis or Clark refused to free the African-American man who helped them to explore the West.  Here, Hillary could not have survived without Tenzing.  The ancestors of both men are interviewed and it's done on equal footing.  For those who promote multiracial teamwork, this is something to see and remember.",1175040000,5,794,4.909774436090226
