Great show made by great people. Buy today so they can make another amazing season!",1366934400,,303,4.224137931034483
8581171,5,B00CF6583G,"Ninja: the Mission Force certainly isn't for everyone, but if you are the right person you will absolutely love it (as I did).  How do you know if this show is for you?  The easiest way would be to check out the website.  But if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater, or you get together with friends to watch bad movies, and definitely if you know who Godfrey Ho is--this show is for you.",1366761600,,392,4.131578947368421
8581172,5,B00CF6583G,"I've been looking forward to it for weeks, and Ninja The Mission Force: Season 2 has finally arrived!

And what did I think? It was great!

Allison Pregler did a fantastic job as Cheetah Lee, the street smart tough as nails secret agent and Ninja.

That a new character was the star of the show was refreshing and done expertly. I get the feeling Noah Antwiler's part might have been Bruce's (although I could be wrong) and it's a shame they couldn't work that out because no one would have expected an entirely new and unconnected cast.

The only thing I would criticize about the disk is that it doesn't work as well straight to DVD.

I know that they need to make enough money back to do another season, but not seeing it every week along with a trailer for what's to come was a little unsatisfying.
Check out the first episode that's already online, it works so well in this format!

That being said, this disk is still worth every penny, a very enjoyable series.

I'll of course be buying season 3 as soon as it comes out, but I may go as far as to only watch one episode a day... if I can resist the next button that is!",1366761600,,1126,4.258215962441315
