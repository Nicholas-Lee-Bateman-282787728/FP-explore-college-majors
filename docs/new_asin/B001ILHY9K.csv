8311168,5,B001ILHY9K,"One of the truly great actors in his greatest role (Knock).  He plays a doctor who buys a country practice.  As he arrives, he's told by the outgoing doctor that he won't have many patients since the town prides itself on its health.  Jouvet just gives him a look.  Within 3 mos. he has the whole town believing it is sick and has turned the hotel into a hospital.  A really good satire on our trust and belief in modern medicine.  Someone should remake this movie for modern times since we're way beyond the level of hucksterism that Jouvet represents in this great film.",1410566400,,572,4.451923076923077
