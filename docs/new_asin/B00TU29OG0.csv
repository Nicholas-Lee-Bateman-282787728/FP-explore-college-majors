8703091,3,B00TU29OG0,I would not have watched this movie if not for Jesse Spencer. He shows a different layer of acting and even gets to play violin. But its not that great of a story.,1507507200,,163,3.9696969696969697

8703093,4,B00TU29OG0,"Very good story line, and well told when it comes to timing and pace. If you like urban realistic crime stories about young people trying to make it in the big city-- you will like this film.  The story of this film goes like this: A Swedish amateur musician and socialite by the name of Signe (Alicja Bachleda) trying to make it as a singer in New York City witnesses a murder of a drug dealer in a apartment owned by Nicholas (Jesse Spencer), whose father is a prominent Wall Street financier/crook.  She captures the murder on her cell-phone while hidden in a closet, hoping to blackmail the wealthy Nicholas.  She than escapes from the apartment and with nowhere to go she telephones August (Columbus Short) who she met at a night-club a month before, and who has the hots for her.  The two meet the same night, and soon Signe implicates him in the murder of the drug dealer, who has a Dominican criminal brother working for the Russians by the name of Angel (played wonderfully by Wilmer Valderrama) searching the streets for his younger---dead--- brother...the story gets more complected when new facts come to surface...what really occurred on that tragic night in Nick's apartment? Does the video captured by Signe show the entire truth?

***Alicja Bachleda is a Polish actress; therefore, I don't understand why she could not play a Polish native as compared to a Swedish one in this film.  Is Sweden more appealing than Poland? What was the reason behind her playing a Swedish girl? Not many Swedes in NYC anyway, compared to the Polish-American diaspora in NY....it does not make much sense.",1450656000,,1602,4.765342960288809

8703096,4,B00TU29OG0,"August (Columbus Short) is a no accent Nigerian immigrant who aspires to be a night club DJ in New York. Me meets a lot of unsavory characters and provides us with background narration throughout the film. Signe (Alicja Bachleda) a Swedish immigrant who loses her accent half way through the film, has just witnessed a murder and has the film of the incident on her cell phone. August was the last number in her cell to call. The man who was murdered was Jesus (Kareem Savinon) a drug dealer on the Lower East Side. A rich kid Nicolas (Jesse Spencer) is seen taking his life with a pillow. Meanwhile Angel (Wilmer Valderrama) Jesus' brother is playing detective to find his missing brother. With bills overdue and blackmail material in hand...

The plot becomes twisty which was the main selling point of the film. There appeared to be attempts at dark comedy, i.e. when August consults his horoscope for guidance, but overall it was simply a crime drama/ thriller with emphasis on drama.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, near nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1428192000,2,1034,4.738888888888889
8703097,4,B00TU29OG0,"Synopsis :The story is about a bartender, a desperate woman who might or might not be playing everyone. A murdered drug dealer, the son of a billionaire and a brother that will do whatever it takes to find and exact justice on whomever killed ""his"" brother.

The film revolves around August (Columbus Short) who also narrates quite a bit of the film. (Wilmer Valderrama) was excellent as Angel the gang banger looking for brother Jesus ,who was Murdered. The big question and the mystery is by whom?

We never know who's telling the truth or who's lying as each story becomes more complicated and at the time makes sense. There's violent content but nothing over the top gory.

I found it to be an entertaining thriller/mystery with Great acting and a well written script.",1428105600,5,772,4.746268656716418
