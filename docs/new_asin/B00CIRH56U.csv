8582163,3,B00CIRH56U,"Victorville, it's that desert community that most breeze past at 70MPH (or faster) on their way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas (and back again).  Filmmaker Jack Arnold did a fly over for the opening sequence from his 1953 sci-fi chiller It Came From Outer Space ... other filmmakers have used the surrounding desert for mood, locations showing desolation and so on. The point is, not much happens there.  Little rain, mild winters (except for those bone-chilling desert nights) and hot summers.  It's the desert, but it has a water source from the drainage of the nearby San Bernardino mountain range ... people go there to get away from Los Angeles; it's quiet. That is until now. It's the Labor Day weekend and in writer/director Riley Wood's The Victorville Massacre we learn that the local police have a problem.  There is a serial killer on the prowl in the quiet neighborhoods of this sprawling desert oasis. The streets have become a hunting ground ... locals have either gone missing or been found murdered and the chief of police (Frank Piciullo) is concerned that the killer might just be getting started. Against this backdrop of terror, we find that nine of the locals (alert: the victim pool) are going to have a weekend blast.  Five are attractive beauties (alert: a necessity for any good slasher flick), Mary (Briana Baker), Lane (Lisa Lane), Ria (Susannah Hart Jones), Lisa (Jen Nikolaus) and Stephanie (Sonja O'Hara) and their four more-than-eager male companions share a history; they are friends ... it will be good times with plenty of alcohol and many (hopeful) sexual encounters. Of course, in any genre film titled The Victorville Massacre, it is only a matter of time before the serial killer comes knocking as an uninvited guest.  But has filmmaker Riley Wood thrown a curve our way?  Are these victims with a purpose and is the killer actually on the guest list? There are lots of twists and turns in The Victorville Massacre.  The blood flows freely and you'll have to wait until the final act to see if the last man -- or, perhaps, woman -- standing is the one the chief is actually looking for. Or, maybe it is just a disgruntled gambler on the way back from Vegas with anger issues!
The acting is pretty good, especially the police chief (Frank Piciullo) playing just the right mix of quirky intensity. Director Riley Wood is also fun in a cameo.",1421884800,,2376,4.763990267639903

8582165,4,B00CIRH56U,"Clearly not the best of the horror genre, but far from being the worst. It's actually fun to just watch how everything pans out. The antagonist does have an imposing presence on screen, and the end monologue actually feels compelling.

It probably helps that I know the guys behind the scenes, but I still feel that this title deserve a good shot. If anything, turn it into a drinking game :)",1401667200,,392,4.52112676056338
8582166,2,B00CIRH56U,"It you need a slasher film for Labor Day, you might want to start the ""Halloween"" series early instead. In the small town of Victorville, there is a serial killer. There appears to be a connection among victims whose homes were repossessed. Nine college kids goes to Matt's (Kevin Brown) house in Victorville to party over Labor Day weekend. Matt loves Lisa (Jen Nikolaus) whose boyfriend is Andrew (Hiram Xavier Gonzalez) who is seeing Mary (Briana Baker). Stephanie (Sonja O'Hara) is coming along, who attracts boys. The kids play ""Truth or Dare"" because that is what they do in horror movies to undress the girls...which didn't happen. Without a lot of suspects, Scooby-Doo, the film does what it can to give us a twist to the who-dun-it aspect, unfortunately that twist has been done and better.

The acting at times wasn't half bad. Unfortunately the film also boasts bad actors, especially the police chief (Frank Piciullo). The plot was bland and we got flashback character details after a character was killed. The soundtrack (Austin Creek) was a plus which reminded me of NIN. The film claims to be 90 minutes on the DVD cover, but in reality clocks in at 73 minutes. I felt my life was refunded 17 minutes.

Low end slasher rental at best.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Near sex. No nudity. Sonja in a bikini.",1378339200,,1314,4.779735682819383
