8596567,4,B00DR6506I,"I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to experience the way urban teens live and think today, done creatively and often very funny. Michel Gondry is a wizard at making films that look thrown together but are actually well structured slices of the worlds we don't see.

My only complaint is that I wish the DVD came with subtitles for the hearing impaired - about 33% of the verbal zingers fly by too fast to catch!",1397347200,2,424,4.435897435897436

- the characters on the bus ride are the real life people they portray -- same names. {Laidychen plays Laidychen}.",1397347200,,371,4.904761904761905
8596569,4,B00DR6506I,"""The We and The I"" (2012 release; 103 min.) brings the story of a group of high school kids in the Bronx. It is the last day of the school year and when the bell rings for the last time, a group of about 15-20 kids take the same New York city bus to get home. The unique premise of the movie is that the entire movie plays out on the bus, in real time. Hence we get to know the bullies, the outcast, the geeks and the nerds, etc. The only scenes not taking place are the occasional flashbacks about a party or some other scene. The kids discuss and argue, sometimes getting into shoving matches or worse. Through it all, the bus keeps going.

Couple of comments: I only had the vaguest idea of what the ""plot"" would be like. As it turns out, this is a somewhat experimental exercise, almost style over matter. The movie is a talk movie, which is a difficult premise for your average American moviegoer. And it's not just talking, but all the talking is done by urban high school kids. The movie is directed by Michel Gondry, best known for directing ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" some 10 years ago. One ""faux pas"" in the production is that by the time the movie concludes, the sun has set and New York City is dark. Whoa? This movie takes place sometime in June presumably (last day of the school year), and if school lets out even as late as 4 pm (unlikely), it'd be about 5:45 pm at the end. Hardly when the sun sets in June. But in the end it's a minor quibble.

This movie was announced sometime in 2013 at my local art house theatre here in Cincinnati as ""coming soon"", but for whatever reason never made it here. I had pretty much forgotten about this when I happen to notice the DVD, so I just had to pick it up and check it out. This movie is definitely not for everyone. If on the other hand you are in the mood for a conversation-driven, slightly experimental movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, I suggest you give this a chance.",1389484800,,1973,4.258666666666667
8596570,5,B00DR6506I,"It was interesting to see the lives of these kids. My cousin Elijah is in it. I can see a huge difference between kids that live in the city and the kids that live in the mountains. Though city kids have confidence, I see  the kids that live out of the city are more mature. Kids will be kids. The movie was good. I hated that my cousin dies at the end.",1387152000,,353,3.9027777777777777
8596571,5,B00DR6506I,"I have only seen this film once, and expect subsequent viewings to reveal more layers of complexity.  I am too boggled and besotted this morning after to do more than list the ways one might love this film.
I was at first upset that the film is not on Blu Ray, but be assured that the DVD is very well done, and looks fine, even beautiful on a big screen TV.
First, from my perch in mainly white suburbia, I appreciate the intimacy that permits me to gaze carefully at all the different shades and shapes of people who ride the bus on the trip home after the last day of high school.  Ken Kesey's Kool-Aid Acid bus could not contain more physical and psychic diversity.  Just compare this film to American Graffiti to see how far we have come in the presentation of adolescent emotional realism on film.
Second, is the miracle of film editing that concatenates fluctuating tender affects and nasty impulses into a coherent unfolding.  See this film less as plot or character driven than as a collage of emotions finding their voice just as instruments express emotions as sonic textures in orchestral music.  Or perhaps better, think of the editing of this film as like a basketball game, in which emotions are passed around as quickly as the heart can follow.
Third is the unexpected ending, which deserves a chapter length essay by itself, as one ponders whether the final pair are likely to find happiness, despair, or wisdom.  A boy and a girl find each other at the end, in the dark of night (what a long bus ride) -- but is that progress, or a Hollywood ending?",1379548800,,1567,4.519434628975265
8596572,4,B00DR6506I,"Michel Gondry's follow-up to the 2011 action movie ""The Green Hornet"" is something of a cinematic and social experiment. In his latest work ""The We and the I"" a group of New York high school students (all played by non-professional teenagers) travel on a city bus.  Set on a fictional bus line BX66, the film follows the stories of the ensemble characters crammed in the same bus - those energetic students after school, often noisy and even rude.

Michael (Michael Brodie) and Big T (Jonathan Worrell) are the loudest, taking up the back row. Laidychen (Laidychen Carrasco) and Niomi (Meghan Murphy) are busy deciding who to invite to the party. At first the bus is like a chaos, with so much pent-up energy of these students. The school tear is over.

Over the course of the afternoon bus ride, however, as the school kids get off the bus one after another, the bus ride becomes something different - something quiet and pensive, with some of the students showing another side of their personalities.

This is not a documentary but a fictional drama. For this unique film Michel Gondry based his screenplay on the interviews with the teenagers he recruited at the Bronx community center ""The Point."" The film keeps a fine balance between real and fantasy, with vivid sketches of the teenagers, while the bus journey itself makes for a metaphor.

The film begins with too many narrative threads to follow, busily shifting between them. Not every thread is interesting, I must say. Some threads just fade away as the bus travels on. Some brief flashbacks (with Gondry's whimsical visual style) cut in.

""The We and the I"" is a snapshot of these high school students, snapshot that is spontaneous, experimental and lively. Bumpy at times but seldom boring, the bus ride is worth taking.",1367625600,4,1785,4.836065573770492
