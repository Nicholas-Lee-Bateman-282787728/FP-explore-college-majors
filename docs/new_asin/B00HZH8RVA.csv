Picture and sound is great.",1516924800,,164,3.4594594594594597
8637480,5,B00HZH8RVA,"I grew up watching The Professionals as a kid, and whilst it might seem a little dated or non PC, and slightly questionable in places, it's highly entertaining and I've actually been enjoying it more than I did then. If you want a snapshot of England back then with some fast paced action adventure thrown in, then this is the series for you!",1508630400,,342,4.444444444444445
8637481,1,B00HZH8RVA,"I'm giving this series a 1-star simply because it is NEVER available for the USA fans. I've been waiting YEARS for this series to come out on DVD in USA format and it has never been released for us. A friend of mine and I would LOVE for this series to be available here. Please, please, PLEASE allow this. I miss Bodie and Doyle! Come on, UK manufacturers. BRING IT!",1483574400,,366,4.242857142857143
8637482,5,B00HZH8RVA,"I've been waiting years to find these on DVD or Bluray and it's been worth the wait as the remastering on these was... masterful! Thrilled to see all the old characters, You know the RS2000 Escort, 3.0S Capri and who can forget about the classic Granada? Oh yeah,  Bodie, Doyle and Cowley were pretty good in it too!!",1482624000,,317,4.4655172413793105
8637483,5,B00HZH8RVA,"I love this show, I never get tired of these guys doing their man thing!",1459296000,,72,3.8666666666666667
8637484,1,B00HZH8RVA,"Unfortunately, it's very dated. We got it to see Martin Shaw, (George Gently) who we love, but we were disappointed.",1444780800,,116,4.85
8637485,5,B00HZH8RVA,"Compatibility: The discs are labelled as A,B &C compatible, but I was unable to play on 2 region A players, therefore you'll need a multi-region player to watch.

Packaging: Excellent! Box set comes in two parts. One part contains four Blu-Ray discs, the other is a very comprehensive soft back book containing 180 pages of extremely detailed notes.

Presentation: Awesome! Contains 13 completely remastered episodes in 5.1 surround sound and includes the episode ""Klansman"" that was never shown on British television due to it's sensitive content. Please note that these shows were filmed in 4:3 format, so will display black bars on the sides of a HDTV. Disc four contains the special features including an eye opening, no-holds-barred documentary and tons of pictures including early shots of Anthony Andrews who was the original ""Bodie"". Also, anyone with a BD-Rom can access PDF files containing scripts.

Overall: The Professionals as you have never seen before. Fantastic picture quality and can't wait for MK II coming at the end of September.",1405209600,5,1051,5.207100591715976
