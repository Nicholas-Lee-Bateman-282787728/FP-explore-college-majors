8697865,1,B00S9O4LC2,"Just another black woman bashing movie. I'm so over these types of
movies. have we not heard enough of why the black man don't date black
women? Labeling all black woman the same and all white women the same
is so like them. All women are different. These days a black woman can't
enjoy a movie without something being said about her in a negative way.
Smh If you ask me it's all just self hate.
So for that I personally do
not like this movie.",1427760000,,444,4.174418604651163
