8528873,2,B008LYCE4M,I generally like twisted movies and this one certainly had an interesting concept. That said the dialog and acting were pretty flat and the movie didn't hold my interest. I give it some pluses for the unexpected ending but that didn't really redeem the rest of the film.,1353542400,,270,4.645833333333333
8528874,4,B008LYCE4M,"I really enjoy all the Jason Gerbay films but waiting for this one to come out, I am a little disappointed. ABOUT CENSORSHIP! THIS MOVIE IS A WINNER!!!Come on SUBWAY! What a great promotional piece this would have been. The trailers were not censored and that's why I had bought the movie. It took alot of the imagination out of this film.  A little disappointed, but I guess they have their reasons. It's hard to watch a movie with black and distorted squares covering parts up. If not for that I would have rated it a 5 star classic. I would love to have an uncensored copy! Come on Jason, hook me up!!!!",1343001600,,606,4.3628318584070795
