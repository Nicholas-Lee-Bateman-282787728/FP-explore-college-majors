But Jeff breaks things down so well, that he takes the mystery and complexity out of the movements. Also, if you have a question, he will respond to his emails quickly (I emailed him, and he got back to me the next day). Quality guy, and quality DVD's.",1421020800,,387,4.6231884057971016
8475856,5,B005JKBQGS,"I got this as a gift. I didn't watch it for a while because I thought it was going to be corny, and, because as a black male, I must admit that I bought into the whole ""white people can't dance"" stereotype. So, one day I was really bored and popped this DVD in because I thought I'd have a few laughs (entertainment, you know). I was shocked. Dude can dance. He taught me how to pop. No lie.",1315267200,2,391,3.962025316455696
8475857,5,B005JKBQGS,"This DVD was awesome, ur truly a great teacher and the movements were broken down so i could learn without rewinding a zillion times. I have been following the teacher (aka TheRussianTiger) on YouTube for years, only criticism is the video quality is not top of the line, but who really cares because the bottom line is I really learned from it.. if I can learn that says something. I definetely recommended this if you want to learn popping, but be ready to be committed, it takes practice. With RussianTiger teaching, this is your best shot.",1315267200,,543,4.666666666666667
8475858,4,B005JKBQGS,"I bought this video along with the basic one, and was happy with it. You can read my review on the basic video which I though was great, no need to re-review it here.

It took me about 3 weeks of practicing with the basic dvd before I felt comfortable moving on to this freestyle dvd. It has a lot of useful tips and the practice techniques are helpful. Last 15 min is a lot of talking and less showing. Perhaps wait until you got the basic moves before getting the freestyle DVD, not necessary to buy them at the same time if you give up after the first one, you really need determination for this.. imo.",1315267200,,605,4.170940170940171
