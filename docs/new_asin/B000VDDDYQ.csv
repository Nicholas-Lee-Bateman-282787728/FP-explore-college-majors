2937325,5,B000VDDDYQ,"I ordered this for my kids and it ended up being a great way to sit with the kids and enjoy time with them. Its so hard to find anything these days that is family oriented without all the cussing, making fun of each other, and teaching kids that its okay to talk back to parents or disobey them. Sit coms now days show that its okay to disobey and make fun of parents and anyone in authority. If they showed more shows like 7th Heaven then maybe it would be one step closer to getting things back under control. It all starts with teaching kids about respect and telling the truth...novel thought, isn't it?",1200182400,5,607,4.28695652173913
2937326,5,B000VDDDYQ,"This item was a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law. She already owned Season 1 and wanted Season 2, so I was delighted to be able to give her the entire Series for a reasonable cost. Thank you amazon.com!!",1199664000,,208,4.5
2937327,5,B000VDDDYQ,"I got hooked on this tv late,starting in the 10th season and the 11th. It is avery good tv program for the whole family to watch. I can't wait for more DVD's to come out. It is 100% . Sorry it ended.",1198540800,,199,3.761904761904762
2937328,5,B000VDDDYQ,Very quick shipping.  Price was excellent.  All 5 seasons for under $100.  To buy this same product with each season separatley would have been double.,1198540800,2,151,4.96
2937329,5,B000VDDDYQ,"7th Heaven 1-5 Seasons is the greatest gift i've got this year !
The story of Camden's family is the best in all tv shows",1198368000,2,121,3.88
2937340,5,B000VDDDYQ,"This is by far the best TV series I've ever seen.  A normal, every-day family that lets you in to see the ups and downs of real family life, but they still have that bond of love and committment to one another that gets them through everything.  They touch on a wide variety of topics (sex outside of marriage, drugs, racism, gangs, death, etc.) that probably touch all families in one way or another and show a positive way to deal with them.  Annie, the mom, is my favorite character.  I hope to be like her someday.",1214870400,3,518,4.309278350515464
2937341,5,B000VDDDYQ,"The ""Seventh Heaven First 5 Seasons"" came right on time - made it before Mother's Day and it was just what my mother wanted.  She'd been wanting those for awhile.  Thank you for great and timely service!

2937342,5,B000VDDDYQ,"A few months ago I purchased season one for my wife's birthday and since then our family has been addicted to this program.  Our children are close in age to Ruthie, Simon, and Lucy so they can relate to many of the adventures that occur in the Camden household.

This is just a great family television program.",1212278400,,311,4.43859649122807

2937344,1,B000VDDDYQ,"The first five seasons of 7th Heaven can be purchased at Amazon for $85.  Since the fifth season will probably drop to $15 soon, the first five seasons will then be $75.  Why pay $90 for a box set?  Shouldn't this item be cheaper than the individual seasons?",1210809600,5,258,4.333333333333333
2937345,5,B000VDDDYQ,"hey everybody, this is one of the best buys around on this set.  You are getting all five seasons and they are all in their regular individual boxes like you would buy them regularly.  You can't beat the price for this set and it is just such a great show, you can't go wrong.  Make the purchase, i know that you'll love it, everyone that i know whose watched it has absolutely loved it and it's a great show for every age.",1204848000,3,423,4.134146341463414
2937346,1,B000VDDDYQ,I love this show and this was a great deal for me to be able to enjoy it from now on.,1201996800,,85,3.0952380952380953
2937347,5,B000VDDDYQ,"This is the most heartwarming show ever on TV.  We should have many more shows like this for families, young and old alike.  I can't find enough praise to attribute to this show.  The actors are great, the episodes are so true to life (though perhaps somewhat modest compared to what we see these days) and the way they handle the day to day problems is beyond compare.",1201910400,,369,4.397058823529412
2937348,5,B000VDDDYQ,"This is an excellent DVD for children of all ages.  We bought this for Christmas for the kids and now on weekends we all sit together, stay up late and watch a few episodes.  It is funny, always has a nice lesson, kids can relate and learn something.  They deal with many different childhood and adolescent topics.  It's worth every penny!!!!! It has brought us together at night and gotten my kids off the computer!!!!!!",1200700800,,421,4.573333333333333

8218247,4,B000VDDDYQ,This series presents some of today's issues in a format that is interesting for children and teens and provides a basis of discussion.  I have a 14 year old and 17 year old and both surprisingly love to watch the episodes and we try to do this as a family.  It is a good way to discuss different topics of today's world.,1265414400,2,320,4.145161290322581
8218248,5,B000VDDDYQ,"5 seasons all bundled together? What more could you ask for?! Definitely worth the purchase, at any price. I'm a big 7th Heaven fan and have all the seasons to date so would have loved to have bought the first 5 seasons packaged together like this! It's also a great gift idea for any fan of the show. Parents, keep in mind this series promotes morality so I believe it is a very good example of family television that you can leave your kids to watch alone. It encourages positivity and helping others, being the best you can be and helping others to be the same way. A great show and I would recommend it to anyone! 10/10",1251590400,,623,4.288135593220339

8218251,5,B000VDDDYQ,"I am enjoying the series very much. I will be ordering series 6 and 7 at a later date. Story presents interesting and realistic challenges that the family must face. It should be a ""must"" for those of all ages.  I stongly recommend the series for others.",1230249600,,254,4.404255319148936
8218252,1,B000VDDDYQ,"I bought this for my wife because she loves this show. But, I must attest I cannot stand 7th Heaven. It is the worst cast ever. Terrible acting. Even worse set. I just want to flatulate and vomit each and every time this show is on.

Take Care",1229644800,2,243,4.0625
8218253,1,B000VDDDYQ,This whole show is the same episode over and over with altered additionally lame dialogue.,1229472000,2,90,5.066666666666666
8218254,5,B000VDDDYQ,It is fun and good for all ages. I am waiting for next seasons to came out. Very exciting! Good for family night and for Sunday morning.,1229385600,,136,4.074074074074074
8218255,5,B000VDDDYQ,7th Heaven is great fun.  It is amazing to watch the children as they grow up year to year.,1215907200,,91,3.789473684210526
