3113568,5,B0013K8J86,"I bought this DVD along with the TV Movie because I was curious of the Son Rise program.  THIS DVD IS AWESOME!!! RON IS MASTERFUL IN IT!!!  The DVD gives you very practical but highly insightful strategies that you can apply with your kid right after you finish watching it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD for EVERY parent of an ASD child, doesn't matter if you do Son Rise or not, these strategies can be applied.  There is one strategy called JOINING, this concept may be controversial for any super hardcore ABA viewers.

I must say, my husband tried that strategy right after watching the DVD.  My son can sit all day bouncing a ball if you let him, my husband took another ball and got on the floor next to him to join in this activity...MY SON STOPPED WHAT HE WAS DOING AND STARED AT HIS FATHER BOUNCING THE BALL!!!!

This DVD provides multiple key strategies that can help you with engaging and developing your relationship with your child.",1349827200,17,945,4.523529411764706

3113572,5,B0013K8J86,Bought this DVD and WOW!!!  He went through the principles in detail.  This is a must have.  I have been through the Start Up training and the new Frontier and this is a must have!  I felt like I was attending training.  This DVD is worth every dollar you spend.,1207699200,18,262,4.16
3113573,5,B0013K8J86,"This is the most informative DVD with actual tools that can help my child today!!! The booklet that it comes with is also a wonderful bonus! I love that so many of the tools he gives us are backed by published studies! I have purchased so many DVD's regarding Autism and they have not even come close to this one. I was never bored and I could not believe I was laughing and crying at the same time. When I finished the DVD I was so inspired by Raun Kaufman. I felt like it was my own mini training session. I love that I can go back and click on different sections on the DVD and watch again different goals. I really feel like I came away with practical ways that make sense to help my son. My son is doing so well and I encourage ALL to buy this amazing, inspirational and practical DVD! It is the best one out there!",1204502400,21,820,4.067901234567901

8251502,5,B0013K8J86,"While mention is made that the Autism Education Center of America has additional training available for those working with autistic individuals, this DVD is definitely not just an infomercial as some reviews state. However it is also not a list of specific  concrete steps you can take as each child is different, but it IS an exceptional introduction to principles to help you connect with a child on the autism spectrum along with clear explanations as to why these principles work.",1499904000,,484,4.9753086419753085
8251503,5,B0013K8J86,I think all providers need to look into this breakthrough of autism---was an eye opener for me,1484784000,2,94,4.588235294117647
8251504,5,B0013K8J86,Good Book To Read,1461456000,,17,3.5
8251505,2,B0013K8J86,This was not helpful to me nor is it what I was expecting.  I was expecting to see strategies in action with real children.  This turned out to be lecture -- like a lecture seminar.  The material may be useful but it is the most basic.  So for these reasons this was wildly too expensive. Had it been $10 I wouldn't have minded being so disappointed but for something nearly $40 it's extremely disappointing. I didn't even finish it.,1452556800,2,433,4.443037974683544

8251508,5,B0013K8J86,"This is one of the best resources if you have a child with autism or any kind of learning disability.

Raun is a warm, caring, and wonderful lecturer and you will truly enjoy watching him speak.

Highly recommended.",1396915200,6,215,4.631578947368421
8251509,5,B0013K8J86,AWESOME DVD I received the order late but the product is amazing I found this DVD very helpful  It's a great resource,1381190400,5,117,4.318181818181818
8251510,4,B0013K8J86,"My husband struggled understanding autism and how to help our child. Raun does a great job explaining what goes on in the mind of an autistic child.  My husband found this DVD very helpful and he feels more confident how to relate to our child. It's a good resource for men to relate to.

However, I would like to add that I don't completely agree with the Son Rise Approach to therapy to decrease autistic symptoms. I think it's effective to build a relationship from the beginning stages but long-term I feel it's too lax. My daughter has made leaps and bounds of improvement in a very short period of time through the Lovaas Program. The expectations were higher and the therapy is strict but very effective.  Perhaps this is better suited for the small percentage of children that don't respond well to the Lovaas approach.",1369872000,6,827,4.6506849315068495
8251511,5,B0013K8J86,"I watched only half the DVD and really confirmed myself again that this is the best of all particularly over behavior modification practices based on rewards vs punishment theories simply ABA method. As a father of autistic son, I think this DVD is a must for any NEW or OLD parents to buy and I hope someday the copyright holder of this DVD should make it totally free on Youtube in many different languages to spread it's strategies to the whole world of autistic community.",1360540800,13,476,4.6117647058823525
