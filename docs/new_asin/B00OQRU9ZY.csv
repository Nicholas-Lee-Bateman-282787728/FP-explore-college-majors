6759223,5,B00OQRU9ZY,"I like this box set, it's the end of Kageroza Inaba's real identity (Aoka Yushima) plan. This box set has a lot of action in it, if you've seen even just the previous box set #23 then you'll like this one as well.",1427155200,,213,3.9767441860465116

6759225,4,B00OQRU9ZY,"Finishes off the last filler arc with this set. It's a good buy honestly. I just really wish they'd put this stuff on Blu-Ray, but since it's Viz we're talking about here, I guess we gotta stick with the 480p DVD quality. Next set will introduce the Fullbringers Part 1, which should be released Jun 16th",1421884800,6,304,4.446428571428571
6759226,5,B00OQRU9ZY,"This is the second half of the filler season (story that is not part of the original manga novels) but is probably the best of all the fillers.  You get to see several match-ups in this season you would not have seen otherwise thanks to the captain clones, such as Kenpachi meeting his match!  Himself.  And Byakuya facing off against Hitsugaya.",1420675200,6,345,4.622950819672131

8684555,4,B00OQRU9ZY,"Warining, SPOILERS:
For a filler arc, this one is actually quite stellar. It actually fits itself into the timeline quite well.  The main villain of this arc is irritating, but makes sense in the context of the ""Mod Soul"" story. Also, Ichigo's descent into losing control of his powers before ultimatley losing due to his using the ""final getsuga tensho"" against Aizen is something I think could have been utilized in the manga instead of the abrupt loss that happens (especially the part where Ichigo's hollow go out of control, and his friends have to subdue him). Also, it's nice to see Ganju and Kukkaku Shiba back (however briefly), considering the important ties they have to Ichigo (which are revealed in the final arc.) Also, the last Episode on this volume is mostly cannon, based on Chapter 423, and one of the best episodes in the entire series (it might have made more sense for the series to go on hiatus after this episode instead of the Fullbring).

In short, the last episode on this volume alone makes this a necessary purchase for the full story of Bleach.",1493942400,,1074,4.707446808510638
