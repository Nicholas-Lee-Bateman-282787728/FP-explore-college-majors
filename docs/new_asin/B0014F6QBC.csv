And the story was pretty interesting. There has been a lot of ""Llorona"" films lately and this is by far one of my favorites. Its fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. The main character Royce and the psychotic rapist will have you laughing for hours. I loved these characters! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1219881600,,457,4.871794871794871
