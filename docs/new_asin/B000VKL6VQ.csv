2944707,4,B000VKL6VQ,"After watching a very brief portion of one episode at a friend's house, I knew that I wanted to see the whole series.  When I found out that the original pilot was included as a plus that made it all the better.  This is not the best series I've seen, but I can highly recommend it for individual viewing or small groups getting together for a night of good, campy, television.  It is a guilty indulgence that is a welcome addition to my small, but growing, DVD collection.  Now, I am anxiously awaiting my purchase of the next season.",1207008000,,535,4.373737373737374
2944708,4,B000VKL6VQ,"There is just SOMETHING about Dante's Cove. While the acting isn't necessarily worthy of an Oscar, the actors in this series do a really nice job of bringing their characters (and their relationships, accordingly) to life in a realistic, and connectable kind of way. Season one is dark, creative, and cynical, which makes for a great introduction to the series. Season Two, while obviously in a completely different location featuring some different actors playing old parts is still believable, and while less dark, still sets the theme and creates a world that anyone of any sexuality would want to be a part of. If you are looking to escape your world and imagine yourself in a world of very beautiful people, with crazy situations and a LOT of sex, than Dante's Cove is the place for you. If you are looking for a realistic world that you MIGHT actually be a part of real life, check out LOST... it was at least filmed on the same island.",1205798400,10,942,4.6467065868263475

2944710,4,B000VKL6VQ,"I love this show. Doesn't need to be well scripted, or even coherent. I love it for the beef, the good music and the beautiful landscapes. But i think that here! tv are exploiting the gay audiences a little too much. That so called 'lost pilot' is really boring, and doesn't add anything of value to the show. Could be included as an extra, (so lack of them) in the previous editions. If you already have the first 2 seasons, save your money. The lost pilot doesn't deserve it.",1201478400,40,477,4.370786516853933
2944711,4,B000VKL6VQ,"The show hasn't a big budget, the acting is not really good. The plot is interesting and has beautiful people. Any guys are really hot. But why is Tracy Scoggins in this show?",1200096000,,175,4.333333333333333
2944712,4,B000VKL6VQ,"I found this by accident and hadn't heard about it before. It looked interesting so I thought I'd take a chance on it. Very glad I did!
The acting in Season 1 is dodgy and the storyline a bit flaky, but it is fun, very sexy and a must-have for fans of pioneer shows like Queer As Folk and The L Word.
Basically this is a lightweight bit of fun - as the marketing says a ""Guily Pleasure"" and I love it. The guys are HOT, the girls beautiful, there is an intersting plot and the acting gets better (as do the sets and overall production in Season 2). Season 2 is set in Hawaii and looks fantastic.  Both seasons are quite short, with season 2 being a bit longer at five episodes, but it's still well worth the money.
Fans of Buffy, The O.C., Angel and Charmed will love it...",1199664000,23,773,4.119205298013245

2944742,3,B000VKL6VQ,"It's worth all the skin, though there could be more skin like in the first couple scenes, but the acting is wonderfully horrible!
""B"" rated movies have nothing on this piece of work.
I'm going to get Season 2 just for the guys and certainly not for the acting or story lines, which is sad because you can see glimmers of real potential.",1398902400,,336,4.349206349206349
2944743,5,B000VKL6VQ,"This is a great show, it has lots of good looking characters both men and women.  The lack of clothing is not bad either.  The story line is a bit chessy but I don't think they were trying to win an Oscar.  I recommend it.",1394841600,,222,3.888888888888889

2944747,5,B000VKL6VQ,"I stumbled across this show several years ago and when I found the first season (comprised of two 90-minute or so episodes) on Amazon Instant Video, I had to buy them.  It's just as cheesy and soap-opery as I remember but that doesn't make it all that bad.  We all need a little silly soft-core in our lives, right?  Well, okay, so maybe not, but if you feel the need... there are a ton of funny moments and even more hot bodies to distract you from the bad acting.",1377734400,,465,4.202247191011236
2944748,1,B000VKL6VQ,"The only redeeming aspect of this show is the incredibly attractive cast, but even their collective hotness can't make up for the terrible acting, the over-the-top script, and the complete lack of a story line.",1377648000,,210,5.0285714285714285
2944749,5,B000VKL6VQ,Dante's Cove is a good blend of the super natural and sexy encounters.  It is put together so that nothing seems overdone.  From the first scenes of a jilted love and the resulting revenge over the centuries is a nice start to the show.  The current times relationships between gay and lesbian couples is portrayed quite well.  I await the release of season two by Amazon!,1373932800,,372,4.590909090909091
2944750,3,B000VKL6VQ,"I found it quite superficial and predictable
It focussed quite a lot on the appearance of the actors and relied too much on intimate scenes to move the plotline along.  The storyline was a bit weak as well...  The actors did look nice but I was hoping for a better plotline...",1360368000,,276,4.392156862745098

2944754,5,B000VKL6VQ,"The thing I love most about this show is that it treats gay characters as real people who just happen to like having sex with those of the same gender. I am so tired of watching mainstream shows that portray all gays as flaming queens, hair dressers, interior decorators and lisping caractures - not that I have any bias against truly flaming queens, hair dressers or interior decorators but don't throw us all in the same boat.
The supernatural is my favorite genre and the story in Dante's Cove is both interesting and well thought out.  I just wish there had been more episodes each season and that the series had lasted beond the third year.",1358208000,,645,4.560344827586207

2944759,5,B000VKL6VQ,"I was addicted with Dante's Cove right from the first episode. I love the main actors of the series, especially Charlie David.

Casting: Based on ""looks"" (and not on actual acting ability). Script: Whatever links two suggestive music-video sex-scenes together. Characters: It's hard to actually care about these people. And what sick queen did the make-up for this series? (The ""1840s"" women look like 1970s whores.)

Vapid. Clichd. Trash-TV.

The acting is horrendous throughout, the guys look like queer underwear catalog rejects, totally predictable and shallow. The music is of no interest whatsoever, and frankly I struggle to find any redeeming quality to this crap. As if this mess wasn't painful enough to suffer through, some halfwit decided it would add to the ""drama"" to have thunder and lightning at any given time or place, be it a sunny day or a garden party, not a tree moving in the wind and the cars with their top down but somehow as soon as some is indoor there goes the stormy effect.

For my reviews on the first and second season, please see the individual season.

I bought the boxed set because it was cheaper than getting the two seasons separately, but if you already got them, please save your money and do avoid buying this.

As far as this edition is concerned, it is lousy.
It boxes season one and two, all right.
The third dvd is the so called ""lost pilot"" and offers a very crudely filmed attempt at the first episodes of season one. Technical quality is extremely bad, script, direction and acting are even a little worse than that...
In my reviews I complained about the quality of the two actual seasons, calling them a lightweight; well, compared to this ""thing"" they could be considered outstanding achievements.

Extras are negligible here as are those in the other two dvds, perhaps even shorter and worse.",1224979200,,878,4.7254901960784315

I am deeply sad because of the lack of Spanish subs (because my boyfriend doesn't understand English) but hey! there is:
16:9 widescreen resolution
5.1 surround sound audio

When I found out that the original pilot was included as a plus that made it all the better.  This is not the best series I've seen, but I can highly recommend it for individual viewing or small groups getting together for a night of good, campy, television.  It is a guilty indulgence that is a welcome addition to my small, but growing, DVD collection.  Now, I am anxiously awaiting my purchase of the next season.",1207008000,,535,4.373737373737374
3179205,4,B000VKL6VQ,"There is just SOMETHING about Dante's Cove. While the acting isn't necessarily worthy of an Oscar, the actors in this series do a really nice job of bringing their characters (and their relationships, accordingly) to life in a realistic, and connectable kind of way. Season one is dark, creative, and cynical, which makes for a great introduction to the series. Season Two, while obviously in a completely different location featuring some different actors playing old parts is still believable, and while less dark, still sets the theme and creates a world that anyone of any sexuality would want to be a part of. If you are looking to escape your world and imagine yourself in a world of very beautiful people, with crazy situations and a LOT of sex, than Dante's Cove is the place for you. If you are looking for a realistic world that you MIGHT actually be a part of real life, check out LOST... it was at least filmed on the same island.",1205798400,10,942,4.6467065868263475

The acting in Season 1 is dodgy and the storyline a bit flaky, but it is fun, very sexy and a must-have for fans of pioneer shows like Queer As Folk and The L Word.
Basically this is a lightweight bit of fun - as the marketing says a ""Guily Pleasure"" and I love it. The guys are HOT, the girls beautiful, there is an intersting plot and the acting gets better (as do the sets and overall production in Season 2). Season 2 is set in Hawaii and looks fantastic.  Both seasons are quite short, with season 2 being a bit longer at five episodes, but it's still well worth the money.

3179280,3,B000VKL6VQ,"The ""lost pilot"" is worthless garbage, but I found the first and second seasons to be fun to watch, with great scenery, well shot. The writing is sometimes awful and the acting is often poor, but the comparison to this series being a mix of Melrose Place and Dark Shadows is perfect.

If you like campy, dramatic fun with little connection to reality and enjoy watching good looking guys with some ocassional nudity, you should like this set.",1225670400,,442,4.666666666666667
3179281,1,B000VKL6VQ,"I am here reviewing this edition only.
For my reviews on the first and second season, please see the individual season.

I bought the boxed set because it was cheaper than getting the two seasons separately, but if you already got them, please save your money and do avoid buying this.

As far as this edition is concerned, it is lousy.
It boxes season one and two, all right.
The third dvd is the so called ""lost pilot"" and offers a very crudely filmed attempt at the first episodes of season one. Technical quality is extremely bad, script, direction and acting are even a little worse than that...
In my reviews I complained about the quality of the two actual seasons, calling them a lightweight; well, compared to this ""thing"" they could be considered outstanding achievements.

Extras are negligible here as are those in the other two dvds, perhaps even shorter and worse.",1224979200,,878,4.7254901960784315
3179282,5,B000VKL6VQ,Hola I am from Costa Rica and I had enjoyed the three seasons a lot... I can't wait for the next one to come out... Pura Vida.,1219795200,2,126,3.7037037037037037
3179283,4,B000VKL6VQ,"As I mentioned in my other review.
Some are great and some are not.
I liked the series a lot.
If you are into witchery this is your type of movie.
The scene is great and the production.
Surely,there must be someone out there,doing a better
job that I can,but learning. LOL",1214611200,,272,4.25

3179285,5,B000VKL6VQ,"Dante's Cove has a very engrossing story and some interesting (and attractive) characters. Some pretty graphic sex scenes (gay and straight) and lots of nudity (male and female). The original pilot is terrible and spoils the 1st part of season one, skip it.",1214352000,2,257,5.0
3179286,4,B000VKL6VQ,"What an awesome movie. I watched the original pilot first. then I went to the first season, was very interesting to see the changes they made. This was my first gay thriller.",1213056000,2,174,4.46875
3179287,5,B000VKL6VQ,"OK, here's the thing. If you're going to buy Dante's Cove first two seasons separately you are out of your mind. BUY THIS, the Lost Pilot is a plus you can't dare to refuse even if what you are looking for, are the hotties on the other episodes.

I am deeply sad because of the lack of Spanish subs (because my boyfriend doesn't understand English) but hey! there is:
16:9 widescreen resolution
5.1 surround sound audio
that makes kind of enough material for me.

BUY IT you won't regret it.",1211414400,3,491,4.444444444444445

3179289,5,B000VKL6VQ,i absolutely loved this series.  It was dramatic yet interesting to the point where i was looking forward to the next episode.  I cant wait to see season three with my boy Jensen Atwood.  I totally loved him in Noah's Arc.  I think he would bring great delight to Season 3.,1208476800,,273,4.294117647058823

I wasn't able to watch it when it aired because I was about 12 and had no idea what Here TV was. Lol Sadly, the 3rd season was being sold for a very unreasonable price. Thus, I decided to buy the seasons digitally, so I can enjoy them on my ps4. The premiere episode (movie) had me hooked the moment it began. It was filled with hot men, women, witches, a warlock, sex, and drama!",1504915200,,474,3.9479166666666665
