The movie should be able to stand as is without someone adding new material into it. Especially material that makes no sense at all. The sound of crickets, while the people are walking around inside? WEIRD!",1489708800,,324,4.603448275862069
8129670,1,B0001DMXWE,"I haven't seen this DVD version.  But, having seen it on You Tube, I don't think tampering could have made this film any worse than it already was.  Acting, directing and editing are horrible.  No one is allowed, however briefly, to be anything more than a talking manikin.  There are numerous close-ups where someone speaks a forgettable line, and the camera lingers on his or her face for what seems like an eternity.  Gratuitous noises and effects having nothing to do with the story are used haphazardly. One character, an alleged medium, announces about twenty times that there is a presence in the house trying to communicate with someone.  At one point, the entire cast is wandering outside during a storm, and the audience is subjected to interminable footage of nothing but wind and lightning in the trees.  In the last ten minutes or so, a half-hearted effort is made to give it some sense of a plot and denouement.  It may not be the worst movie I have ever seen, but it definitely makes the final three or four.  And at some eighty-five minutes, it's still far too long.  In other circumstances, it might have made a passable Night Gallery episode.",1380931200,2,1160,4.698019801980198
8129671,1,B0001DMXWE,"Alpha decided that this old B & W public domain haunted house yarn would be improved with the addition of solarized color sequences and superimposed lightning, plus obnoxious and ineptly applied ""spooky"" sound FX (in LOUD stereo, when the original movie is in tinny mono). It is a complete hack job that robs this modest production of its low-budget regional charm. Stick with the Sinister Cinema tape, which offers the film as intended.",1100649600,22,437,5.0
