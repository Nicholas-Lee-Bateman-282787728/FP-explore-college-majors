Seller has contacted me and is allowing me to return the unwanted item.  Would like to change my feedback from poor to EXCELLENT!",1282780800,,273,4.891304347826087

7824479,5,6302341795,"If the 1973 version ever comes out..Somebody please let me know!  It was filmed in COBO HALL in Detroit. I was there right by the stage.  I once saw it on a special on TV and saw myself. A local radio station gave away tickets..nobody was hardly there.  Little Richard called for everyone to come to the stage.  There were The Shirelles, Danny & the Jrs.etc. Great Memories!",1103587200,10,374,4.455882352941177
7824480,4,6302341795,"There are two movies with nearly identical titles: ""Let the Good Times Roll!"" (1973) and ""Let the Good Times Roll"" (1991). The former, a rock revival film, is not available on home video so far as I know. (Neither is ""The Panic in Needle Park"" from 1971, which also breaks my heart.)
The 1991 movie for sale on Amazon is about the New Orleans Jazz Festival. I ordered it here in Vancouver, thinking that it was the 1973 movie I had loved for so long. This ain't that movie; it is, however, quite entertaining in its own right. It features interviews with the founders/organizers of the Jazz Fest and many, many acts. I've never been to the Jazz Fest (been to NO exactly once) but feel I would know what to expect were I to go.
If the 1973 picture ever comes out on video, I'll let you know (I would pay $100 for it).",1064966400,27,816,4.2709677419354835
7824481,5,6302341795,"Is this the revival concert movie with Chubby Checker, Little Richard, Bill Haley, Chuck Berry and etc.  If it is, it's one of the greatest concert movies ever made (though the one I'm thinking of was made in the 70's-- not 1991).  If not, I've never seen it.",1034553600,3,259,4.375
