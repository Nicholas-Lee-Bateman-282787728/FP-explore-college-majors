8580163,5,B00CC3XVPE,"The second part to the Outlaw, Enter Lillith, continues where the first episode left off. A very complex story of a chessmatch between God and Satan, using people as pawns in a struggle between good and evil. The story is very evolving and draws you in.  The music is excellent and the Heavy Metel score, is everpresent.  There are 17 episodes to go and this mini serie has a great cast and excellent music.  The Lilith is a sensual seductress that seduces men, while being able to change herself into different woman.  It is a combination of a heavy metel musical and a biblical story. Great camera work and excellent special effects and intense music work together to make this a great mini series. I look forward to the other chapters.",1366675200,2,738,4.6106870229007635
