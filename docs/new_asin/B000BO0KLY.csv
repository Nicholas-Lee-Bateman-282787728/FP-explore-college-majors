2430813,4,B000BO0KLY,"Set in West Palm Beach, Florida (but filmed in San Diego, California), Silk Stalkings was a sort of ""Miami Vice"" lite for the 90's.  Telling the story of Homicide detectives Chris Lorenzo (Rob Estes) and Rita Lee Lance (Mitz Kapture), Silk Stalkings shows the detectives solving crimes of passion among those living the high life.

While I will admit that the show tends toward the cheesy, this guilty pleasure consistently entertained me throughout its 8 seasons.  And despite the cast changes over the course of its run, the series remained watchable throughout.  The possible exception is the latter half of the fifth season, but I will leave that for my review of that season.

Season Four starts off with a two-part episode ""Natural Selection"" that is surprisingly dramatic.  These two episodes were the first episodes I saw when flipping through the cable channels during the original run of the series.  I liked them enough that I continued to watch the show regularly.  Soon enough, USA network put the show into a five-nights-a-week late night slot, and I quickly caught up on the first three seasons.

In addition to the usual story of Chris and Rita solving a murder each week, this season also saw good use of the supporting cast, including: Captain Lipschitz and his wife (played by vaudevillians Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall, married in real life); Donnie ""Dogs"" DiBarto, the friendliest mafia don in Florida; and Atticus Dunn, who continued to scheme (and impose upon Chris' patience).

Season Four also continues to explore the relationship between the two main characters, Chris and Rita.  Although both are involved in romantic relationships with others that ebb and flow over the course of the season, their dependence on each other deepens throughout, both professionally and personally.  This is shown to good effect starting in the first episodes, and this central relationship of the series would be taken to its conclusion in the events of the first half of Season Five.

Although some might argue that the first half of the fifth season is a stronger group of episodes than season four as a whole, for my money seasons four was the strongest complete season of the series.  Some weaknesses did start to show in the show's formula by this season, however.  Certain plots began being recycled from earlier seasons, and a few guest stars from earlier seasons appeared playing different characters as well.  But as a complete season, Season Four presents a very strong set of episodes, possibly the most coherent and enjoyable of the whole series.

While this show is personally a 5-star for me, the guilty pleasure factor and the lack of strong extras in the package led me to give this DVD release four stars.  But for fans of this show, this season was the best of the bunch.

2430819,4,B000BO0KLY,Great police drama from the USA Network.  Join the team ask they solve murders as part of the Palm Beach Police Department Detective Division.  Not suggested for children as their are sexual and violent seens in the television series.  I find it much more entertaining than Law & Order.,1363564800,,286,4.795918367346939

2430821,5,B000BO0KLY,I am completely happy with purchasing the Silk Stalkings t.v. series season one through six. I am looking forward to more of the t.v. series to come out on dvd. This has been one of my favorite thriller/crime investigation shows from all the ones I have watched. It is a classic. Hopefully Silk Stalkings will release more dvds on Amazon.,1345507200,,338,4.65
2430822,5,B000BO0KLY,Good show.  Actors believe able and the characters were strong.  Story lines were easy to follow with good sequential order.  I love the great outfits too.,1340150400,,155,4.884615384615385
2430823,5,B000BO0KLY,"Having been made in the late 80's, early 90's, it's surprising how up to date the plots and actions are.  No cell phones but everything else A-ok.",1223164800,,146,4.407407407407407
2430824,5,B000BO0KLY,"One more t.v. series I came across while looking on Amazon that I added to my Wish List and received as a birthday present.  I was skeptical of my taste in the early 90s vs. today.  I remember thinking it was a kind of a newer, maybe shallower Miami Vice-style, that was pretty risqu for regular cable t.v.  I used to watch it sporadically on USA late at night, but probably never saw two episodes in a row.

My fiance and I watched the first episode with my parents.  None of us really got into it and I felt a little disappointed.  A little while later (days? a week?) my fiance and I were looking for something to watch that wasn't too long, so we gave it another whirl.  After the second episode we were hooked and preceded to watch a bunch, one after another.  We cruised through the First Season way too fast that I even found myself watching the Extras!  To make a long story short, we're about half way through the Fifth Season now and dread the inevitable, that this is the last season out on DVD.

Yes, there is 90s cheese, florescent outfits that we can't believe we thought were cool, some questionable hairdos, swimsuits, only large-chested women always seemingly getting out of a pool at the crime scene wearing a thong bikini, every episode opens with a sex scene that ends in someone's death, and the list goes on and on.  However, we are totally hooked and love every episode and season!  It's part romantic comedy, part t.v. detective series drama.  I loved Miami Vice, but usually didn't find myself laughing whereas with Silk we are laughing during every episode and feeling good at the end of them.  There also is very little blood and gore.  You get the idea of what happened, but often see no blood when someone is killed.  The chemistry between Chris and Rita as well as them and the others characters is great.  I would say our only disappointment is you get attached to a few characters that all of the sudden never show up again in an episode (some of the coroners, Cotton, etc.).  Also, they are kind of bad about reusing characters that had such strong parts in episodes that it is sometimes weird to see them again in a different episode as someone different.  All in all, 5-Stars!",1187222400,,2211,4.468827930174563
2430825,5,B000BO0KLY,This is the best silk season ever!!  Except for them killing off the greatest guy ever!  It has lots of passion and chemistry.,1173139200,,126,4.434782608695652
2430826,5,B000BO0KLY,"My hubby is a groupie for this series, so he is thrilled with it.  Good quality, basic packaging, but full of everything he wanted.",1172016000,,131,4.458333333333333
2430827,3,B000BO0KLY,"I thought this season's episodes ""mysteries"" weren't as funny or out-there as the earlier seasons, and the guest stars, writers and directors not up to snuff (save Gordon Dawson, who wrote the best ep. ever, ""Soul Kiss"" and shows up for one good ep. this season, ""Red Flag"").  With John Byner gone and Donnie ""Dogs"" Dibarto's appearances way down, the show overrelies on ""relationship"" story arcs for the two cops that aren't all that compelling (as oft noted, the relationship between the two cops was always the best part of the show, not the various dullards they end up dating).  It's as if this season they were trying to make the show more ""normal,"" with less outrageous plots, the wild color schemes toned down a bit, etc.

Still, Estes and Kapture's chemistry was excellent, Captain Lipschitz is still around, and if you like the show, you'll find the season acceptable.  I still think the order of quality is season two, then season three, then season one, followed by five, which starts off well, but then gets sidetracked when the actors quit and they too-quickly had to sew up a romance-between-the-cops story arcs that there should have been more time to explore.  To me, season 4 is the weakest Estes/Kapture season, which is still better than the seasons that followed with other cops.",1170374400,,1300,4.837837837837838
2430828,1,B000BO0KLY,"I had an error message ""Please Check Disc"" when I attempted to play Disc 2, episodes 9-12. Everything else in Season 4 was okay.

I notified the manufacturer that Silk Stalkings Season 4, Disc 2 was defective. They sent me a replacement which was Season Two, Disc 4. I notified them by email about a week ago that they sent me the wrong replacement. My email was not acknowledged.

Hopefully they won't hold me accountable for their error

If I receive the correct replacement I will rate the series 4 stars, otherwise, my 1 star rating will be it.",1157241600,,548,4.515151515151516
2430829,5,B000BO0KLY,Boy I really missed this show - Rita and Chris - geez the chemistry the best ever on TV!  It is still just as great as it was the first time I saw it on cable.  Gosh - I can't wait for season 5 to be released! Dang I wish they would both be in more stuff....what a waste of beautiful talent!,1150416000,2,291,3.6774193548387095
2430830,5,B000BO0KLY,"As I live in Brazil, I used do watch Silks Stalkings on cable.

 I never missed an episode. The plots were really interesting

 and Mitzy Kapture and Rob Estes had such a chemistry together

 that made you really believed they were partners and best

 friends!

 As Mitzy got pregnant and she and Rob left the show,they stopped

 airing it here, so it's amazing to be able to watch the best

 late night series all over again!

 I can't wait to buy season 5!

 And even though it's been more than 10 years, the series haven't

 aged a bit. Each episode mantains its charm,mistery, passion and

 sometimes humor. A must see...",1142553600,4,625,4.490909090909091
2430831,5,B000BO0KLY,"Silk stalkings 4th season is a smashing experience! With lots of action, drama and sad stories combined, this is the best season so far! Rita and Chris is still the all time favourite couple, now with new hair cuts and a tiny improvement considering their outfits. I highly recommend this show to all! Silk Stalkings is dearly missed, and watching gorgeus Rob Estes as Chris Lorenzo is a great bonus! Buy it!",1141948800,6,408,4.680555555555555
2430832,5,B000BO0KLY,I've been a fan of this show for so many years and when I found out it was on box set I know I had to have it.

I guess I will just have to wait and see!!!,1141948800,,305,3.3098591549295775
2430833,5,B000BO0KLY,I'm so glad they decided to release Silk on DVD!  I loved the show when it was on tv and then they stopped showing re-runs all togeter and the series ended.  I'm a fan of Rob and Mitzi.  Chris and Rita are my favorite out of all the pairings!  The show was awesome!,1141257600,,265,3.943396226415094
8089800,5,B000BO0KLY,"The first two DVD sets (Season 1 & Season 2) have interviews from several cast members as well as from Stephen J. Cannell himself. He said of the show it was his longest running show (i.e., 8 seasons).

The show is about two cops who have a certain chemistry & are best friends who deeply care about each other. They are both detectives and are assigned cases that are referred to as silk stockings (sexual based crimes of passion) and the show takes place in Palm Beach Florida although most of it was filmed in San Diego and some of it in Scottsdale, AZ. Rita (Mitzi Kapture) narrates the stories that she and Chris (Rob Estes) star in during the first 5 seasons. That narration helps out a lot, but you won't find it after Mitzi left the show.

Captain Harry Lipshitz (Charlie Brill) is back and Atikus Dunn (Cotton Dunn's brother) helps bring some humor back into the show with his con artist antics. Chris didn't die and has a new love interest. Rita also gets involved. Perhaps this season is the height of this show. The show also portrays that difficulty that some people have being married to the job vs. having healthy lives outside of the office. I am glad that I bought the series. Mine had 3 discs (double sided) in two cases and an outer box.",1490659200,,1256,4.432900432900433
