8472823,5,B001Q221BC,I was lucky enough to find a NEW copy of this tape. I watched it and I must say. Joey G and the BHV Hip Hop Posse deliver some good performances. my favorite song/music video on here is Every Good & Perfect Gift Too bad there was no more after this at least not to my knowledge. But it is a good tape none the less. Also a good soundtrack Too those reading this the soundtrack is called. Joey G A Double Dose. Which can be found here on Amazon both in CD and MP3 formats.
