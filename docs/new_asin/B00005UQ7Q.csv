1666227,4,B00005UQ7Q,"Milos Forman's 'fireman's ball' is a classic among political satires.. It is remarkable that a film so subtle would be condemned by the czech government. It, in fact, appears harmless to our sensibilities today.. this indicates just how repressive the czech government was at the time.. Not to indicate any superiority in the U.s. (think of all the books and movies that have sadly been censored and banned from schools and the like here)... The fact is this film is a great satire of a desperate nation - forman comments on the common phrase of the time - if you do not steal you are stealing from your family.

The technical aspects of the film are also spot on.. It is perfectly formed and sculpted at 73 min.. as elegant as a Borges short story.. highly recommended viewing.",1169769600,3,778,4.63768115942029
1666228,5,B00005UQ7Q,"Hori, ma panenko (Firemen's Ball) is perhaps the finest example of the fresh, amusing, and humane style of the Czech New Wave.  Milos Forman's movie is funny, sweet, and highly memorable.  This is one of my very favorite films.  Look especially for Josef Kolb and Milada Jezkova as an honest fireman and his perhaps less-than-honest wife; they are especially charming in this fine, mostly non-professional cast of real Czech firemen and townspeople.",1158364800,3,449,5.208333333333333
1666229,3,B00005UQ7Q,"It's being hailed as one of Milos Forman's greatest films. He moved to America from Czechoslovakia after his film was banned ""forever"" in that country. I did find it somewhat amusing.

When a fireman's ball dissolved into anarchy, the movie then became truly interesting. One actor had a gift for showing a lot of emotions with his face and I enjoyed watching him. I suppose that the film says a lot about small town life in that country at the time it was made, and it certainly wasn't flattering. But the government must have been way too sensitive to make a fuss over a little bit of self-deprecating humor. I think the average Czech citizen would recognized a little of themselves and chuckled.",1154476800,2,698,4.67479674796748
1666230,5,B00005UQ7Q,"Watching ""The firemen's ball"" as a teenager on German television in the late sixties, I recall that I never laughed about any other film as much as I have about this one - and I wasn't even stoned! An absolute must for people who enjoy rolling around on the floor for a good healthy laugh. Not being able to remember the actual title for many years, I started browsing on amazon.com and was thrilled to find it. I recommend this to anybody who loves to ""let their hair down"" every once and while.",1125446400,3,496,4.344086021505376
1666231,5,B00005UQ7Q,"On one level, this is an absurdist comic masterpiece and on the other it is a scathing political satire and parable.

Here you have a bunch of firemen who are on one hand hopelessly stupid, incompetent and corrupt, and on the other hand they are insufferably pompous, self-important, and frauds---and the film shows just how completely they muck up something so simple as a village dance, retirement party, lottery and beauty paegeant, while completely failing in their official capacity as firemen on the same night.

Forman's obvious target was the Czech Communist party in the late 1960s; the film was immediately banned when the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact armies invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the atempted ""communism with a human face"" reforms of Alexander Dubcek while the world stood by and watched, just as it did when Hitler's tanks rolled in some 30 years earlier.  As a result Forman fled to the US where he's continued an illustrious filmmaking career.

What's interesting is that Forman shot the film on location, in a tiny and remote Czech town using actual Czech firemen and villagers---this lends an unmistakably authentic quality to the whole film.  The DVD version has been colored, but the original was in black and white.  There is an excellent special feature interview of Forman speaking about his experience making the film and afterwards, as well as a brief feature with his cinematographer who oversaw the colorization and digital transfer of the original film.

If you are aware of the history behind the film, you'll see it as a tragedy.  If you are not, it will probably come off as an almost Woody Allen-ish comedy of errors.  Either way a very enjoyable 73 minutes!",1107820800,3,1700,4.957746478873239
1666232,5,B00005UQ7Q,"He may be bathing in millions on account of his big Oscar wins for ""Amadeus"" & ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""--but director Milos Forman perfected his basic style with films like this, one of the most cherishable little comedies ever made.  Indeed, its hour-and-fifteen-minute length makes one crave reliving this warm and extremely human story again and again.
Made while Forman was still living under Communist rule in Czecholslovakia, ""Fireman's Ball"" was meant as a satire of government bureaucracy, though the story can be enjoyed purely at face value.  The firemen are pathetic pillars of the community who engage in endless and logic-bending arguments over ridiculous little points, desperately nabbing any reluctant teenage girls for the beauty pageant; while the people outside are enjoying and upsetting the ball (even stealing all of the edible raffle prizes) to their hearts' content.  Everybody's concerned only with himself or herself......until an outside siren leads everybody to a fire destroying an old man's house.  Finally, everyone seems united in a common cause.  The tragedy of the story--as well as the Czech people--is driven home.
Absolutely wonderful transfer--those of us who've caught it in infrequent TV broadcasts (notably on the USA network) have had to endure white subtitles obscured in decrepit-quality prints, or lost in the screen detail.  Here they are completely readable.  The interviews with Forman & his erstwhile photographer Miroslav Ondricek are enlightening.  My one complaint is that this Criterion Collection edition doesn't give us Forman's original English-language introduction, appended to original American & British prints of the film (he looked quite stylish in a beard).
Amazing, too, that this film uses no professionals among its actors--simply friends and even schoolboy pals of Forman's.",1065657600,13,1850,5.535460992907802
1666233,5,B00005UQ7Q,"How to get busted in a totalitarian regime: make a film like Firemen's Ball. Just watched that last night. Amazed. Brilliant transfer. May not be as poignant as Loves of a Blonde or his later works, but a rousing critique of the regime with some really funny scenes. But, again, that transfer amazed me. Hard to believe it's a 35 year old czech film. Highly recommended. Enjoyed Forman's comments on the film and the debacle that ensued. He was almost locked up for 10 years and was luckily helped out by none other than Francois Truffaut! Beautiful.",1040169600,2,550,4.680412371134021
1666234,5,B00005UQ7Q,"The Firemen's Ball is one of a handful of Czech films that defined the ""New Wave"" era, and had a profound influence on filmmakers and critics around the world.  Other important films of this period include Forman's ""Loves of a Blonde,"" Jiri Menzel's ""Closely Watched Trains,"" and ""Larks on a String"" (a Menzel film that hasn't been released on DVD, to my knowledge).  But Firemen's Ball is a personal favorite, probably due to the fact that I lived in the Czech Republic for five years, and attended similar village balls.  The characters in this wicked satire are portrayed with humor, affection and above all a level of realism that remains unsurpassed.  In the end, Forman does what he does best -- he leaves you torn between laughter and tears.  This film is a must-see, especially for those who are interested in understanding how filmmaking evolved in the 60s.",1020470400,10,866,4.824324324324325
1666235,4,B00005UQ7Q,"This delightful film of Milos Forman (Amadeus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) tells the story of a dance sponsored by local firemen in a small Czech village.  In it, Forman sets the stage for a subtle critique of society under Soviet-style Communism.  The dance itself is held to honor the retiring fire chief who is dying of cancer but of course,  will not be told of this. The firemen hilariously set out to haphazardly pick girls out of the crowd for a Beauty Contest to be held during the dance (the list is constantly bickered about back and forth between the fireman and eventually lost in the confusion).  Also, there is a table of assorted prizes for a raffle which is guarded over by one of the fireman and his hilariously bitchy and not too observant wife.  The raffle prizes gradually  start to disappear, but who is to blame?  Add to this the wonderfully wacky free-for-all of a beauty pageant and a real fire and you have one of Forman's best early films.  Many of the ""actors"" are actual local villagers and this is all for the best as human failings and character are highlighted to underscore how people  living under an authoritarian society begin to think only of themselves and what they can get and also the issue of who is guilty and who is innocent in this society.  Highly recommended!!",974592000,24,1311,4.587982832618025
1666236,4,B00005UQ7Q,"This movie will take us to a little village in 1960's in the Czechoslovakia. It is a story about ordinary people living very ordinary  lives. Every year they go to the Firaman's Ball organized by local fire  department, but this year things get little out of control. This movie is  very unique for few reasons. There are not too many real actors. The people  are actually locals from the village, where the movie was filmed. They act  themselves, which gives the movie great authenticity. The story is  wonderfull,exposing not too good side of human nature, yet it's very  entertaining. I would compare it to the movie American Beauty, taking place  fourty years ago. You maight not like everything you see, but at the same  time you realize how much naked true the movie is.",966556800,8,776,4.731343283582089

I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I do remember it was shown on a Saturday morning. The title says it all, but the crazy things that happen in this film are so outrageous, that you'd never know. This film is what's referred to as a dark comedy. I never saw a film like this to this day. Although the original ""Producers"" film from the 60's was so off the wall and hilarious.

So many ridiculous things happen in this film. It's full of honesty and the short comings of people. You'l think, ""Oh man, how could they do that and be so selfish and petty?

7955018,3,B00005UQ7Q,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Released three months before the Soviet crackdown on the progressive Dubek administration in Czechoslovakia, Milos Forman still had to deal with a negative reaction to 'The Fireman's Ball' from both Communist censors and his own producer, Carlo Ponti. Forman's farce was intended as a good-natured ribbing of the Communist system, specifically its corruption and bureaucratic ineptness. The censors and Ponti didn't like it because in their eyes, it had no sympathy for its working class subjects, who come across as complete fools.

  As the story goes, Communist officials decided to play the film in the small town where the film was shot, which featured locals playing themselves as members of the local fireman's committee. As things turned out, the officials were shocked when the townspeople vigorously applauded the film. They identified immediately with the broken down system, where a fire breaks out across the street, but the firefighters are unable to do anything, as their fire truck ends up stuck in the snow. As for their farcical characters, they regarded it as simply 'acting' and obviously were flattered to be chosen to be part of a professional film production. Forman was ultimately saved by French director Francois Traffaut, who ended up buying the film with some partners and distributing it outside of Czechoslovakia, where it was permanently banned after the Soviet invasion.

  As for the film itself, 'The Fireman's Ball', manages to be distinctive, mainly on the basis of the authenticity of its performers. You have to love the amateur cast Forman has assembled here, as they seem to have a natural flair for farce. Nonetheless, the basic theme of the film, the corruption inherent in the Communist system of that time, as evidenced by the constant thefts that occur during the event, go on ad infinitum.

  That's not to say there aren't occasional laughs. When the Chairman has the lights turned off, expecting the thief to return the lottery presents, when the lights do come back on, the opposite occurs: the rest of the gifts are all missing. The deepest laugh remains subtle: one of the firemen attempts to return a headcheese (cold cut) to the dining table, after he discovers his wife has pilfered it. Completely embarrassed, he passes out when everyone observes what he's trying to do and an argument ensues right afterward between two of his colleagues, one shouting down the other that by being 'honest', he's embarrassed the fire brigade. It seems that being honest, is much less desirable then looking out for one's own self-interest.

  The Fireman's Ball plot involves the fire committee's inept manner in which they attempt to choose a local beauty queen. The young women who are conscripted appear not to take the fire officials seriously, and end up running off to the ladies room, where they've made it clear that they have no intention of participating in the committee's ultimate goal (the idea is for the winner of the pageant to present a memento to their retiring chief). While it's one thing for the firemen to be overwhelmed in dealing with the 'larceny problem' at the ball, it's another to come off as completely ridiculous, which is what they appear to be, when they foolishly attempt to put the pageant together and then atrociously fail, with all the young women giggling, and running away from them. Perhaps this is why Mr. Ponti, the film's original producer, did not care for the film.

  Forman does well in breaking up the action at the ball, when he introduces the fire at the old man's house, near the dance hall. The event turns out to be bittersweet, as there's also some humor attached to the somber events. We see this when the crowd moves the old man closer to the fire, as he complains about being cold. And later when they want to give him some lottery tickets, he asks for money instead, as it's obvious all the prizes now have been stolen.

  'The Fireman's Ball' ends on two additional humorous notes. First, the chief finally receives his honorarium from his colleagues--but of course it turns out to be stolen. And the old man whose house has burned down, joins another old man in his bed, without a roof over it!

  Forman's talent here was in getting much out of his amateur cast as well as stretching out a one joke idea, to a full length feature. He makes his point about corruption in Communist society well, in a series of memorable scenes, but is less successful, as he dumbs down his firemen committee members, a tad bit too much. 'The Fireman's Ball' is more important in the overall history of international cinema and world history, than as a critical contribution to the art of comic screen writing.",1358035200,2,4736,4.876558603491272
7955019,5,B00005UQ7Q,"Ignore anybody who tells you you can't enjoy this movie unless you know what was going on in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. That's pompous, ignorant bull. This is a delightful, gently but ruthlessly hilarious movie about human incompetence, which is not limited to any country in any decade, or to any political or economic system.

We human beings like to imagine we're clever and competent, but were aren't and never have been. We're destroying our beautiful world and ourselves along with it, and the more we try to stop the faster we career toward self-destruction; we aim for the brakes but always hit the accelerator. We're a race of idiots, and anybody who believes otherwise is the biggest fool of all.

This is a great movie, and its greatness has nothing to do with Communism or any other ism but with its uncompromising but compassionate and very funny look at what bumbling dolts we all are. A very special and very wonderful movie.",1357689600,,942,4.773006134969325
7955020,5,B00005UQ7Q,"It can be hard to judge a film like `Hori, ma Panenko' if one has not lived through the Czechoslovakian communism that is so obviously the brunt of the humor and criticisms present in Milos Forman's beautiful film.  I personally am far too young and live in the wrong country to absolutely understand where he was headed, why this was so poignant (for the time) and what could have caused all the controversy surrounding the film (it was banned for quite some time).

What is great about a film like this though, is that the themes are so transcendent that one can find a purity and full meaning even without being privy to their origins.

I make this claim a lot when discussing film with friends, because it is the very reason why I find art to be so inspiring.  No matter what avenue of art you are looking at (whether it be painting, sculpture, music, literature, cinema, etc.) it is completely subjective and can only be valued individually.  No one can really tell you that something is better than or worse than something else, because `beauty is in the eye of the beholder'.  It is up to each individual to decide what his likes and dislikes are, and on top of that, to decide for himself WHY a certain film or painting or poem touches him the way that it does.

So, despite not having lived through the exact circumstances made prevalent in `Hori, ma Panenko', I can stand back and look at the film for what it means to me, and this form my own distinct appreciation for the film.

Anyone who says they cannot appreciate a film because of it being `outdated' or `irrelevant' is just lazy.

For me, `Hori, ma Panenko' speaks volumes on society as a whole.  With a comical tone (the film is one I'd label `frustratingly funny', in that the scenes that evoke the most humor can also leave the audience frustrated at the character's seeming ignorance) Forman has crafted a poignant look at how we as people adapt to new situations, and how when backed into a corner by rules and regulations it is almost instinctual to rebel.  With the setting of a ball (or dance) put on in honor of a retiring fire chief (dying of cancer yet kept oblivious), this film simply observes those in charge and those bucking authority, sometimes even (purposefully) blurring the line between the two.  The main focal point of the film is the selection of eight beauty queen contestants, a search that proves pointless and obsolete when a Susan Boyle look-alike walks away with the title.  The film mainly consists of a hodgepodge of hilarious (and completely realistic) situations that move this good-intentioned tribute into complete mockery.

I want to point out that the final `fire' scene is one that, for me, is more darkly somber than humorous, although I understand the humor to be seen (the man concerned about the bill, the moving of the farmer towards the fire).  For me it was the scene that tied the whole film and all it's thoughts on morale together.  It's a seen that almost seems out of place in context and tone but it serves as an enlightening look at a sudden situation uniting disunity.

For me, `Hori, ma Panenko' is stupendous.  If one is intent on looking at it as a historical benchmark and social commentary of the times then they may miss what is so universally great about this film.  Yes, there is a lot to be said about the direction that Forman went with this, and the point he was making for this society, but for us younger viewers (and even those not so young), in order to really appreciate a film we can never fully understand we have to open our minds and broaden our interpretations.",1258502400,,3604,4.568322981366459
7955021,5,B00005UQ7Q,"I decided to fast forward Milos Foreman's statement which proceeds the picture after hearing him say that 40,000 Czech fireman resigned in protest to his film. After all, that proves to be a hell of an achievement, call it what you want to, a more volatile response to a work of art I'd like to hear, and it seemed a charged spiel that might have been too much before the picture. I watched the remainder of his speech after the film, and it turns out what he has to say does not preclude an objective visual of the film, but I hold with my choice.
One of the greatest aspects of The Fireman's Ball is it's brevity. Any geo-social perspective proves unnecessary, as the tale of a night's celebration unfolds with local fireman conspiring to award their retired chief with a notable axe. In so doing they prove themselves highly humane, in the most farcical sense, revealing what can easily be viewed as a critique of fascism, masculinity, small town life, the uniform, rote submission to order or even the silliness of pomp and circumstance. Having no pre-understood idea about what the film features is key. In that way I could be amazed at the subtle and minute quality of the characters, without being driven to observe this as a metaphor for something larger. To witness such artistry is a revelation. I hold that auteurism is legit, and appreciate Milos Foreman's works all the more.
Highly recommended.",1194652800,,1408,4.704453441295547
