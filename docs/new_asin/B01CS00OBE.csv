8754052,1,B01CS00OBE,"This version is a compressed version. Picture quality could be much better. A few parts freezes. Will wait for a better version.  Also, being a collector, this version was plainly packed in plastic sleeves. I prefer the digipak, booklet versions. Plus, strange that there is no distributor or manufacturer information shown while watching this compared to other Korean dramas that I have seen.",1478390400,,393,5.238095238095238
