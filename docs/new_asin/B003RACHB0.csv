4181373,4,B003RACHB0,"This was a clean, cute movie about Cupid's daughters. The acting was cheesy, as was the storyline, everything was completely predictable, but i'm saying this as an adult. For ages, imo, 11-17, this movie would be a solid A, i'm sure. There are not many clean, fun movies like this around.",1329004800,,288,4.666666666666667

4181375,3,B003RACHB0,"I bought this dvd for my 14 year old sister and she LOVED it!  My mother liked it because it is a good, clean movie with a sweet story line that teaches a lesson.  As a teenage boy on the other hand...not my type of movie.  But perfect for tween and teenage girls and their mothers.",1297123200,2,282,4.0

4181378,4,B003RACHB0,"This film is a refreshing approach to films for teens.  The writing is not condescending or oversimplified and portrays believable characters in a supernatural conflict.  Ideal for families, this is a fun film that leaves you laughing with a feel good happy ending.

4181379,5,B003RACHB0,A great family flick!!  So refreshing to watch a romantic comedy that is clean and fun!!  A movie you can watch over and over again and still laugh and cry! Loved it!,1284854400,3,166,4.15625
4181380,5,B003RACHB0,"This film, ""You're so Cupid"" is a fantastic family film.  Disney just doesn't seem to put out enough good ole clean family flicks these days, so it is greatly appreciated that there are others in the industry that still write, produce, direct and act in these great movies.
This film is magical and everyone did a superb job from the actors, Brian Krause (my favorite Charmed character and we all know he portrays godly spirits very well), Lauren Holly (perfect as the mom who could be crazy enough to fall in love with Cupid) Caitlin Meyer and Danielle Chuchran (as two extremely believable magical sisters) and Jeremy Sumpter among many others in the movie.. the director (I watch anything that John Lyde has his wonderful magic touch in) and of course the writer (Sally Meyer, who we hope will continue to write such great pieces of art).
The storyline is still unique and enjoyable from begining to end.  The settings are magnificent and very scenic.  And the little magical special effects are delightfully angelic and never overdone.
Your family will most definitely enjoy this film for years to come...  We rented it then just had to buy it to watch again and again...",1284854400,13,1175,4.773399014778325
4181381,5,B003RACHB0,"You're So Cupid is a squeaky-clean family movie, but made memorable by the perfectly composed music by James Schafer. The soundtrack was obviously written precisely for each plot point and character, enhancing the predictable script. Mr. Schafer's music included a theme that was heard several times with different instruments, and after the movie was over, I found myself humming the beautiful melody. This movie is made better by its meaningful and touching  soundtrack, and worth the cost just to hear James Schafer's music.",1284076800,5,527,5.349397590361446
4181382,5,B003RACHB0,"This is a wonderful movie for all ages.  The story reminds me of The Parent Trap, but there's magic in this movie.  Lauren Holly is a scene stealer, I've been a fan for years.  Brian Krause of Charmed fits right in as the clueless Daniel Valentine. Twin sisters Emma and Lily (Danielle Chuchran and Caitlin EJ Meyer) fall for the same guy, after playing matchmaker to all their friends. It's the first time in love, and sisterly love is tossed out the door like last years fashions, as they do everything they can to make Connor (Jeremy Sumpter) fall in love with them and take them to the dance.

This is a squeaky clean movie, that the whole family will enjoy.",1281139200,18,662,4.446280991735537
4181393,3,B003RACHB0,"It's okay.  Even as a young teen 'You're So Cupid' would never have been my favorite movie (that would have been 'Yankee Doodle Dandy') but, I like Brian Krause so I want for it.  This is not a bad movie it just is not a really good movie either.",1484697600,,246,4.0

4181404,2,B003RACHB0,"First of all, take this rating with a grain of salt as I'm clearly not the target audience; this film is for tweens and teens.  However, I'm going to attempt to be fair.

The pros?  Well, the film does have a decent cast; I'm not stating these are notorious actors and actresses but I do feel that there is talent there.  The cinematography was average: good scenes and pictures in such a small area, but nothing really too witty in how it was filmed.  I think the film had decent closure for a story which I have to mention because so many romance stories do not do a swell job of such.

This leads to the cons.  I think the acting on some of the cast seemed a bit too superficial.  Now, for this sort of story, it really does not matter, but this leads me back to saying if one wants to make a film, then make a film, other wise make a television show.  This is quite close to some sort of film one would find on Nickelodeon or perhaps the Disney Channel.

The story had too many situational issues that made it too fake for me to consider it a film.  The conflict between the parents?  Too far fetched.  While I recognize that many breakups are surrounded by concerns of attachment, I find it too hard to believe that at some point the two of them could not have worked out their differences to a degree where there would have been something more serious other than ""you never chase me out of a room when I leave"" or ""you keep leaving"".

Then there is the children living at two different residences?  I find it hard to think that the kids would have lived at different residences without some sort of conflict occurring with the parents which would have involved the children being in the same residence, regardless.  The daughters were visiting each other 90% of the time anyway, so, that really didn't make sense.

Another issue is the ""debatable"" issue of all the people in high school being in love.  Since when are all the people in school always in a relationship?  What are the statistics for people being in a relationship at that age lasting?  I have to back up and recognize that this is a kids film which is portraying an ideal life of epic proportions, but I can't simply get behind this.  I'm sure it has to do with my jaded high school experience.

And then there is the magic.  That simply comes out of nowhere.  ""Hey, did she just put some powder on that envelope?""  In my day, the feds would be at your door with Anthrax scare concerns, but hey, this is film and that was ""magic"".  The whole magic element in the film comes out of nowhere.  Seriously, why not let the father be riding a unicorn instead of a horse at this point because it isn't as if that was in any way developed in the character up to that point?

I don't want to disrespect the crew or the production of someone's work, but I think this story could actually be a good one with a bit more thought on the story itself (separating it from a simple cliche tween movie to a story of classic proportions).  As it stands, it simply isn't my kind of film.",1483401600,5,3038,4.299295774647887

It gets worse when reality is mixed with a weird version of magic (that hadn't shown up before) that makes a man's-man of a teenager turn into a drooling-over-two-girls-at-once milksop! Ugh! (shudder)
It all wraps up nicely. Is decently clean (no sex (but there is a swimming pool scene with girls in swim suits and parties with cocktail dresses), no language (unless ""breast"" quoted in a Shakespeare play counts)). But is overall boring and predictable.",1476316800,3,684,4.805084745762712

It pulled me in at the right parts, making it so I wanted to find out more, and stay in tuned. This movie is completely clean, which is a huge bonus!

Maybe it is, and I shouldn't have wasted my time.  Probably a 9 year old would enjoy it.  It is absolute silliness. The longer you watch it, the sillier it gets. I am sorry I bothered with it. The storyline is awful.  Also, too much kissing for young girls.  I also don't like the actress who played the wife. She looks strange in this movie. She talks strange too. They should've chosen someone else.  Terrible waste of time.",1517443200,,580,4.607843137254902
