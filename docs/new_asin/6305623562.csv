7892333,5,6305623562,"If you are a fan of Country Music stars from the 50's to the 80's you will LOVE this set. It's really amazing how good even the older stars sound. Some highlights:

Glen Campbell covers the Roy Orbison hit ""Crying"".

Crystal Gayle-""Don't it make My Brown Eyes Blue"".

Roy Clark will make the hairs on your neck rise with ""Yesterday When I was Young"".

If you love ""real"" country music get all three volumes of this wonderful set.",1105660800,3,429,4.461538461538462
7892334,4,6305623562,"This is the first of 3 tapes of a TNN TV special which assembled around 30 country stars of the 70's to reminisce and sing their best-known songs -- Willie Nelson, B.J. Thomas, Glen Campbell, Roy Clark, Jeanie C. Rylie, Chrystal Gayle, etc.  The stories about the songs and the musicians are entertaining, and there are in-jokes and a nice sense of cameraderie. The casual format means the singing is not always up to par, though the backup band of session musicians is terrific. A good choice especially for older country fans.",978912000,5,528,4.739130434782608
