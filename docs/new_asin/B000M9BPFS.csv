If you must absolutely watch this by any means rent it only, you will save yourself the trouble and can get something better. I have nothing good to say.

2727689,1,B000M9BPFS,"Hodder made a name for himself in the Friday the 13th flicks as Jason Voorhees, but he's all wrong for this movie. The Steve Railsback & Carrie Snodgress film ""Ed Gein"" from 2001 is much closer to what really happened for a number of reasons. First, the shock of the real-life story comes from the fact that Gein was a ""normal"" guy with a short-circuited brain. Railsback nails the whole ""Norman Bates"" aspect of Gein without turning him into a cartoon or...as an example...Jason Voorhees. Second, the late Carrie Snodgress nails the character of Gein's whacked-out mother, who forms much of the psychological underpinnings of what he did and why he did it. Third, the 2001 film flows much better as a movie. Ed Gein wasn't an action figure or a hero or a Freddy / Jason / Michael Myers template. Look at how the story was adapted in ""Psycho""...a true psychological thriller, not a gore flick. Also look at the original 1974 ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" That film was based on a non-stop air of foreboding and contained very little actual graphic blood & gore. The 2003 remake of TCM features a documentary called ""The True Story Behind the Film/Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield."" Watch it and you'll see where the Hodder film lost its focus.",1173398400,25,1240,4.71889400921659
2727690,3,B000M9BPFS,"I saw an ad for this in Fangoria and saw that it had Kane Hodder in it and I thought I just had to see this. For being DTV, its got a good production. The  first half is creepy, but gets a little boring, but its worth a rental. My only real problem with this movie is that its good as a horror film, but its hardly anything like how it really happened. If you want to see a much better  movie about Ed Gein(the actor even looks like him), rent the Ed Gein from a few years back, its got the half faces on it. Its not really a horror film though.",1173398400,5,545,3.814159292035398
2727691,1,B000M9BPFS,"With ED GEIN, I half expected to see a true depiction of the man that was Ed Gein and the life he led. Something intelligent. Something real and true to his story. Many many films have been based on the sick twisted life that was Ed Gein: Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Silence of the Lambs, House of 1000 corpses.... blah, blah, blah.

First of all, at the time of his arrest, Ed Gein was a 52 years-old, 5'7"" inch unassuming, frail, shy, quiet, reserved, farmer who kept to himself. He committed his first murder at the age of 48. When he did commit his murders, they were quick, messy and usually sneak attacks.

So, what do we have with this adaption of ED GEIN? Kane Hodder. Nothing

against Kane Hodder, but he's 6'3"", all muscle, far from frail and is attacking people wantonly with axes, shotguns and knives.

He's quite simply, just a ripoff of Leatherface or Jason Voorhees. Stalking his prey, looming over everybody else and staring menacingly at his victims. Why not just call this Texas Chainsaw Massacre 7? To prove my point, Kane Hodder played Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th 7, 8 & 9.

I'm not somebody who gets off on watching movies about people getting hacked and slashed for no real reason, and I'm certainly not somebody who likes seeing real serial killers glorified, but I DID want to see the REAL story. You can't cast a hulking man in the part of a frail old man and expect to do the character justice.

Heck Wallace Shawn would have been better casting or better yet, Bernard Hill.

Not to mention, using flash images from the real crime scene and newspaper clippings of the real man only reminds me of what the movie should have been and it only shows how far off the creators were from giving the title of their movie justice.

If they would take the name ED GEIN off the box and call it something else, it would be worth 2 stars. Like Chainsaw 7 or Voorhees: the prequel. Otherwise, this movie is worthless.",1173225600,20,1940,4.4914772727272725
2727692,5,B000M9BPFS,"I haven't finished listening to the commentary yet, but this movie is as good as I expected it to be. I stayed up to 1am because I couldn't turn it off, and I've needed more coffee from lack of sleep today to make up for it, but no regrets. Some people might think Kane Hodder would be an odd choice to play Ed Gein, too, since Gein was a slight fellow - but Kane plays the ""inner Gein"" so perfectly that you simply don't think about the difference between them physically. And for true fans of this man, it's also fun to actually see and hear him - instead of silence and latex 24/7. There may be nothing more fun than watching Jason Voorhees in action, but this comes pretty close!",1173225600,4,683,4.221374045801527

2727705,2,B000M9BPFS,"Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield, 2006 film

A patrol car finds an automobile abandoned on County Road 11 and notifies the Sheriff. A government worker brings a government farm subsidy payment check to Ed Gein. The police inspect that abandoned car. They wait for a missing persons report. Deputy Sheriff Mason returns home and finds a problem. Ed Gein digs up a dead body for his experiments. His helper asks is this wrong?. Ed says hes just borrowing them and terminates his employee! Elsewhere Bobby kisses his girlfriend and gives her a locket. A pickup truck passes by. Later we see it again. A guard catches a trespasser, but isn't wary enough! Ed orders a bottle of pop at a diner then attacks the waitress! He has another trophy. Bobby tells his Mom about his plans with Erica. He suspects a murderer is loose in the county. The Sheriff tells Bobby about a missing wife, last seen at a tavern. Ed Gein buys a pickaxe and rope at a local hardware store. Bobby inspects that tavern. Nobodys there. He brings his girlfriend along. Bobby notices that dirty pop bottle. In his barn Ed butchers a body. Customers find the store unattended. Another missing woman!

Bobby rushes back home, there is a car crash! [No seat belts in those days.] The radio is broken, Erica was hurt! Bobby runs down the road for help, a truck brings him back. But Erica is gone! Ed Gein has another victim. Bobby calls from a gas station. [No telephone booth?] The son of that gas station owner saw Ed Gein drive by with something sticking out of his car! [That style of police baton was not in use in the 1950's.] The Sheriff goes to investigate. [No electricity in Eds home?] But he is gone with Erica. The Sheriff and his Deputies search the place and find the horrors! What a sick bastard! They go into the barn and see what is hanging there. The Sheriff wants the place searched. Bobby finds his mother! Bobby promises to find this killer. [Curiously, there are no dogs or other farm animals around.] Bobby finds that locket in the grass. Ericas screams are heard. Ed Gein complains about the loss of his father, mother, and brother. Then help arrives in time. Just arrest him! Bobby warns the star, Erica warns him. Ed Gein is arrested, he will stand trial. Not guilty by reason of insanity. Ed spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum and was a model prisoner. [Was he kept dosed with psychotropic drugs?]

The end credits say this story is fictional and any resemblance to any real person is just a coincidence. But Ed Gein was a real person who dug up dead bodies of women and cut them up. He removed their skins and tried to make them into a suit. I suspect his home lacked electricity, central heating, and indoor plumbing, like most rural homes in the 19th or early 20th century. There was a book about this true crime published around 1988. Was his behavior caused by his eating habits or a lack of vitamins? Or maybe by some disease? This story was fictionalized in a story named Psycho which was later adapted to a movie. Elements of this true crime were used in other horror movies. What makes these movies so popular? This does not have a good plot and runs on too long. There was another horrible crime that occurred in urban Philadelphia in the 1980's. The neighbors long thought there was something wrong in that house but nobody did anything. It also inspired a movie about a man who held women captive in his cellar.",1450310400,,3425,4.5209677419354835

2727719,1,B000M9BPFS,"I gave this movie one star because I Clint figure out how to give negative stars. This movie is awful if you know nothing at all about Gein and his life and subsequent crimes ,which largely consisted of not killing but grave robbing(yes there were two deaths that could be connected to him)....If you are either someone who has followed the story of the ""Butcher of Plansfield "" or someone who demands that a movie or story which actually has the gall to use the real subjects name as the TITLE should at the very least get the facts straight, then this movie is downright OFFENSIVE! If you can't use the facts given to you by a guy who actually skinned , gutted, cooked and ate, decorated his house with not to mention killed at least.two women one of which he hung deer-dressing style in his summer kitchen and totally eviscerated and.....sorry.. my point being simply if you.can't make a movie with real info true to the actual case then you are not worthy of directing movies in the first place!

2727722,2,B000M9BPFS,The period setting is quite accurate reflecting the  compliance of (ignorant-uneducated) authority figures as well as the descriptive naivety of the  youthful character leads.  The character of Ed Gein is indeed chilling and reflects a psychopathic disorder demonstrated by the inability to relate to his victim's except through curiosity of anatomical dismemberment. A good introduction leader  study for clinical social/psychologists comparing with modern times. With less emphasis on the gore emotion  and more on the psychology I would have given more stars.,1390089600,2,562,5.804878048780488
2727723,1,B000M9BPFS,"This movie 'Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield' is just embarrassing. Kane Hodder looks nothing like the real Ed Gein but perhaps the biggest crime is his lack of acting ability. He's good with a mask & costume as a glorified stuntman in Friday The 13th 7,8,9 & 10 but should leave acting to real actors. He's about twice the size of Ed Gein too, fantastic. At least Adrienne Frantz didn't disgrace herself in this, the only one that looked like she had taken an acting lesson.

As others have said it doesn't even remotely stay true to Ed Gein's life & crimes and with the cheap, dark & small sets comes across as looking like one of those lame Hatchet movies.

2727730,2,B000M9BPFS,"Don't pick this movie up, it's very poor.  The one you want to see all about the man and the horror story that he created is the 2001 version with Steve Railsback as Ed and Carrie Snodgress as Mother Gein.  This is just lame.

For the sake of redundancy, this is the tale of Ed Gein, the Butcher of Plainfield, who would shock the world with his depraved wants and needs that he kept in his little farmhouse in Wisconsin.  Abused by his unstable mother, Ed grew up to be an awkward, odd man child who was thought of as the village idiot in his rural community.  He was repressed, angry and distressed, and something inside of him shattered his mind.  When his mother passed away, it was just Ed and his memories.  Then he started with the grave robbing, the collecting, cannibalism, the making of human flesh into a woman's suit, and eventually the killing.  Ed was caught when he murdered the owner of the local hardware store, was found guilty by reason of insanity, then sent to a psychiatric hospital where he remained for the rest of his days.

That story being said, however, does not accurately portray this movie.  Instead the director took a very Friday the 13th approach to telling this tale, complete with a beginning scene of a girl running away in nothing but her bra and panties.  The people of this small town were not quirky enough nor innocent acting as they were to be in the 1950s.  The movie seems to alternate two story lines, one of Ed and his antics and the courting of two young lovers, one of them being the town deputy who would eventually catch Gein in the act.  Ed himself is not so disturbing, as he is more of an intimidating, redneck brute of a man rather than the awkward man child he was portrayed to be by all accounts.  Ed also seemed to be attracted to older women who reminded him of his mother, and none of his victms seemed to have a matronly quality about them.  And then he's caught and it all goes down, but you knew that.

Predictable and not much like it should've been for auidences who are unaquainted with the Gein story.  Watch the other for a more accurate story and character study.",1329782400,,2132,4.411764705882353

If you are interested in a film that depicts more of the real Ed, then try ""Ed Gein"", or ""Deranged"". However, ""Deranged"" has a B rated goofy quality to it. However, it still beats this version of Gein's life. Ed Gein Butcher of Plainfield is something you might want to watch if you have no interest in the real Gein? To be honest, I tried watching it twice. The first time ""booooo"", the second I tried approaching it in a non-judgemental way. No matter how you look at it the movie is not good :(  The acting stinks, script stinks, It's boring all the way around itself. If you want an original movie (with out Gein) try ""Trick r Treat"".

The woman (Adrienne Frantz) playing the female love interest was completely unbelievable in her role and I found myself disappointed at the end when she didn't get killed. She was that terrible. She delivered some sort of high pitched whiny monologue at the end about how Ed didn't have the right to decide when people died - only god did. The guy playing Ed Gein was the only believable actor portraying real emotions in the movie. As such, he was the only one you could empathize with in the film.

2727735,4,B000M9BPFS,"I see that this film has had a number of negative reviews.  I've read a few and it seems that there is general disappointment of Hodder as Gein.  Personally, not being an aficionado of 'Friday the Thirteenth' films, I thought Hodder was wellnigh perfect.  His presence is not only hulking and ominous but his eyes betray the full horror of a serial murderer and sexual psychopath.

In many ways, Gein is the archetype of the serial sexual murder, at least of a certain type.  Hollywood has gone berserk about the actual Gein tale creating numerous Gein lookalike movies from 'Psycho' to 'Silence of the Lambs' to 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and others.  No, this film wasn't the exact Gein story but Gein died with most of his secrets locked in the recesses of his disordered brain.  The film, although not revealing any deep insights, let's us actually 'see' was Gein was all about...and what he was about was evil beyond common belief, evil beyond normal comprehension.

2727737,2,B000M9BPFS,"Like other reviewers, I could not accept Hodder as Ed Gein.  He's just too big, strong and scary.  He looks like a killer.  Nothing like the real Ed Gein.

I also didn't expect the gore.  If you like bloody body parts movies, you might like this one--it's pretty graphic and sadistic.

From what I know about Gein, he was crazy, not sadistic.  He was trying to recreate his mother, not terrorize and torture other women.

The real story of Ed Gein is one of sadness and insanity, not of pleasure killing and meanness.  I was hoping to find out more about Gein--particularly his prior life--he doesn't fit the typical serial killer profile, but is one of the most notorious serial killers.  I expected this movie would help unlock some of the mystery, and it fell really short.  In fact, it added more myth than anything else.",1188259200,2,825,4.582191780821918

When I first heard that Kane Hodder was playing Ed Gein, I became excited.  I thought he would be a very scary Gein.  However I was very very wrong,  This movie was okay, but it was not accurate in the portrayal of Ed Gein.  First off, he did not have an accomplice that helped him rob graves who he later killed because he wanted to stop.  They never caught him with a live girl and the cops did not chase him through the woods and put a gun to his head, only to be talked out of shooting him by the very girl he had kidnapped.  If you want a good Ed Gein movie see the one with Steve Railsback.

2727740,1,B000M9BPFS,"I'll be covering ground already covered by previous reviewers, but hell, I wanna put my two cents in.  This is another movie using a famous serial killer's name with the sole purpose of selling a horror film rather than telling a docudrama.  Of course this doesn't stop the film makers from slapping the ol' ""Based on a True Story"" tag on in the beginning.  ""Based"" being the key word here.  95% of this film is fiction, just so you know.  Don't think this is how it all went down.  I may be no expert on Ed Gein or anything, but I've read two books on the case, and I am able to smell the B.S., and there is alot of it in this film.  Oh sure, one or two things may be accurate, but not the important stuff.  This is a true crime case run through the cliched horror movie machine.  Watching this strictly as a horror film is a disappointment as well considering it is so cliched, and you feel like you've seen it many times before(and you have).  Everything's over dramatized for the sake of the viewers.  Subplots and characters added, and of course the climax has to be so much more...climactic.  There's an effective scene or two here and there, but wouldn't it be nice to actually watch a true docudrama about the Ed Gein case?  You'd have to make it a suspense/drama to do it right, not do it as a horror movie.  Kinda like that Ted Bundy film, The Deliberate Stranger with Mark Harmon.  But exploiting a real crime to make a schlock horror film is insulting to the audience as well as those who were victims or affected by the real crime.  What's the point of a movie like this if you're not gonna do it right?  There are so many horror/suspense films that have taken their ideas from the Gein case anyway, so why not do something unique if you're gonna go to the source?  Hell, just look at the cover!  Obviously the intent(and influence) of this film was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, not the Ed Gein story.  I like Kane Hodder, what healthy, God fearing American doesn't?  But the casting was obviously to lure us horror fans as opposed to being realistic.  Same goes for Michael Berryman, who's given the thankless role of Gein's graverobbing partner.  WTF??  How's that for an inaccuracy?  Though Berryman may be the second name in the credits, his role is a cameo.  But I will say, I dare you not to laugh out loud when Gein hooks his corpse up to the back of his truck and drives away dragging him.  Basically, this is a waste of time for both true crime fans as well as horror fans.  You really want something that will make your skin crawl?  Try reading an Ed Gein book or watching a documentary.  Fictionalized Gein films have absolutely nothing on reality for horror.",1177718400,6,2683,4.405295315682281
2727741,2,B000M9BPFS,"They tell little to nothing about Ed and the movie moves incredibly slow, horrible acting. It is creepy and at times some good violence but that's about it. And Kane proves why he's a stuntman and not a true actor. Serial killers like Bundy, Gacy, Gein and especially Dahmer need movies with bigger budgets and to be taken more seriously and have better stories.",1175731200,,362,4.671875
2727742,1,B000M9BPFS,"This was an extremely horrible movie.  i wouldnt waste three dollars on it if it were dropped at my feet.  the whole movie was unbelievably inaccurate.  and who the hell did the casting?  Kane Hodder as Ed Gein?  youve got to be kidding me.  Ed Gein was a little man.  Hodder is a monster. the whole way they portrayed this movie was way off key.  it was portrayed like ed gein got his ideas from leatherface.  why change the names also in a true story?  mary hogan..bernice warden...warden's hardware.  so many other things that were wrong in this movie that im not even going to get into since ima little pissed i spent $20 on this rubbish.  you don't change the way true stories go.  we already have our Norman Bates, Leatherface, and Buffalo Bill.  we don't need another fake representation of the original especially if its a movie thats based on the original true events of someones life.  If you want a good movie get Ed Gein starring Steve Railsback.  It's a little slow but its facts.  only thing iffy is when Ed killed his brother Henry, but nobody knows exactly how Henry died besides hearsay so we can over look that.  anyways horrible movie.  don't waste your time.",1175558400,3,1178,4.523809523809524

The person who played Ed wasn't even close to resembling Mr. Gein in any physical way and the movie didn't even tell the real story. This is so sad to see because it misleads people. What's even worse is crappy movies like this have even got the most ignorant of people thinking that even The texas chainsaw massacre was real, so sad",1174003200,6,416,4.346153846153846
