8389386,4,B0036205LS,"I learned to ski moguls using the old technique of edging the skis, so as I have recently noticed some skiers rotating their skis like windshield wiper blades on moguls I decided to look into a new technique. This video is a good place to start and indeed emphasizes that this mogul technique is almost the exact opposite of carving on groomers. However it is much less work than the old carving bumps technique that I learned. Having skied a long time it was easy for me to pick up. The only criticism I have is that more time in the video could be spent showing how experts ski the difficult bumps such as those oblong bumps at the ends of mogul runs created by skiers straight-lining it instead of turning. Also it is still not clear to me how to ski those broken off bumps one encounters. So if there had been less time on the entertaining parts of the video and showing bad skiers and more time on these special skills I would have rated the video higher. Will this technique work on hard icy moguls and on heavy powder days? I will have to find out myself.",1395273600,,1062,4.315
8389387,5,B0036205LS,"I was skeptical at first, but this guy gives great tips for exercises to do to improve mogul skills. I have gotten much better, and my husband has as well! Each time we watch it we pick up something new and choose a new technique or exercise to try. I recommend this over the Breakthrough series 100%!!",1392163200,2,302,4.315789473684211
8389388,5,B0036205LS,"Outstanding DVD for reviewing and learning key skills, especially those bump skiing techniques.  Well done.  Glad to add it to my pre-season collection for review by me and family members.",1296345600,,188,5.233333333333333
8389389,5,B0036205LS,"This was an excellent primer on how to mogul ski. The narrator, Peter Hart, had a very pleasant manner that was conducive to presenting the information, and it was clear that a real effort was made to break the skills of mogul skiing into a coherent and understandable set of building blocks. I have had enough experience working on my mogul skiing to see the utility of what was presented, and I suspect that the analysis provided will assist me when I apply the information to the slopes during the next ski season. The lessons were understandable, clear, interesting, and presented in an engaging way, the narrator is learning how to improve his skills with an expert, and his understandings of the lessons from the master illuminate the lessons for the viewer. I highly recommend this video to anyone seeking to further their mogul skiing skills, this was a genuine help.

Since writing this I have had a couple of seasons with this video to guide me. I have definitely improved in my technique as a result of this video. I am just OCD enough to take the cd with me on the ski trips to review at night, and it helps get me up mentally for the heavy duty moguls in certain areas at Alta.",1278633600,4,1190,4.5092592592592595
