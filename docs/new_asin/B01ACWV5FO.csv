8747105,5,B01ACWV5FO,"As moviegoers, however, Filipinos demand respect. They refuse to patronize Filipino movies just for being Filipino. This brings me to my other points.
Filipino audiences crave variety.
While slapstick antics and love triangles can be the subjects of good movies, they are not the only available subjects of movies. The next point is related to this.
Filipino audiences want to be challenged.
On one level, this means that they appreciate being shown that history is interesting. As a history enthusiast, it pleases me to think of how many people who previously found history boring became history lovers because of Heneral Luna.
On another level, Filipino audiences appreciate being made to think. They appreciate being confronted with tough questions, and Heneral Luna raises many of them.
I am not only referring to the obvious, such as Bayan o sarili? and whether it is indeed true that our real enemies are not the Americans or any other foreign power but ourselves. The film raises other issues for debate, such as whether Gen. Antonio Lunas notion of patriotism is the only valid one, and how Filipinos can be inspired to love their country given that human nature finds it easier to sacrifice oneself for ones family or friends rather than for an abstract principle like nation.
To these questions, the movie does not give easy answers. Frankly, neither do I have easy answers of my own to these questions. But I think that the nation would be just a bit better off if, because of Heneral Luna, Filipinosleaders, decision-makers, votersare discussing these issues in their dinnertime conversations in addition to, if not instead of, show biz gossip.
Filipino audiences love movies that tell good stories and show a lot of humanity.
Heneral Luna is not the first Filipino movie based on historical events. But it is the first Filipino historical movie I have seen (perhaps there are others of which I am not aware) that avoids the pitfall of other similar filmsthat of sacrificing storytelling techniques to the point that the resulting product ends up more like a documentary or a homily. While Heneral Luna is admittedly didactic, it tells a good story: that of an admirable but flawed person pursuing a worthy goal amidst obstacles.
Ultimately, people do not watch movies for spectacular visuals or for crowd-drawing names in the cast. People watch movies for good stories. While it is possible to make a bad movie out of a good story, it is impossible to make a good movie out of a bad story. People want protagonists to root for, experiences that enrich and place viewers face-to-face with their own humanity.
Heneral Luna reminds audiences that history is, ultimately, a story about humanity, a story full of emotion and action, of successes and failures, of lessons learned and strong connections between the characters and the audiences. Many more stories similar to it remain to be told, and Filipino audiences are waiting for someone to tell them.
I do not intend to imply that Heneral Luna is beyond constructive criticism. However,others have already pointed out elsewhere the ways in which the movie could be improved. I am sure that the filmmakers are taking notes, not content to rest on their laurels.
For now, it suffices for me to thank the makers of Heneral Luna for showing Filipino audiences the respect they deserve, for not underestimating the capacity of Filipino audiences to appreciate a challenging, engaging, and well-done movie.
But just the same, I do not want to put the Filipino media off the hook yet. Now that it has been shown that a different, intelligent movie based on Filipino history can, indeed, draw Filipino audiences, I expect the media to pick up the cue and keep up the trend.

8747107,5,B01ACWV5FO,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I was afraid of maybe getting a DVD-R or something, but no.  It was the real deal original.  It's interesting to see U.S. History from the other side of the War.  It's interesting to me how General Arthur MacArthur was one of the generals who helped defeat the Philippine Army, and his son later helped free them from the Japanese some 40 years later.

The production values were pretty good.  What I especially liked was the way the tactics and historic detail was kept and most of what happened seems to correspond with most eyewitness accounts from the book it was based on.  An excellent movie in my opinion.",1469404800,,642,4.578947368421052

8747110,4,B01ACWV5FO,"Probably the most decent Filipino movie I have seen since Jose Rizal. I love how different languages can be heard in this film; You obviously have Tagalog, then there's Castilian, English, and a dash of French. Being a Filipino, it was amazing to see how warfare probably was during the Heneral's time. After watching this, I just felt more proud of my heritage and ancestors. I will admit, there are times when the acting gets a little over the top, but even so, it's still a pretty good movie. I think people who love history might enjoy this.",1457395200,4,545,4.571428571428571
8747111,5,B01ACWV5FO,It is difficult to find films (or any information at all) on historical Filipino heroes of the Philippine-American War (1898-1903).  This is a good one of several that have come out in recent years.  Very high production values and capable acting; shows Luna's weaknesses as well as his strength.,1457222400,3,296,5.020408163265306
8747112,2,B01ACWV5FO,"Very confusing movie: does not really explain the fight berween Luna and Aguinaldo. Luna comes out as a ruthless killer with an ""obey or I will kill you"" mentality. Questionable historical accuracy.",1456531200,,198,5.21875
