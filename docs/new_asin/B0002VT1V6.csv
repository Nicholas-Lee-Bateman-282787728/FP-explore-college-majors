8033406,5,B0002VT1V6,"""Severance Pay"" aired originally March 23, 1985 while ""Eruption"" aired April 6, 1985. To me it may as well have been yesterday. These two episodes are among the very best ever written for the show. Even though the climactic air battle was simply stock footage from a Magnum P.I. episode ""Two Birds of a Feather"" a few years earlier, I highly enjyed the storyline. It's no coincidence that Chester Krumholz wrote these episodes. His writing was the best of all the writers in my opinion.

""Severance Pay"" tells the story of a man who is screwed out of his bonus retirement check and goes rogue after seeing his friend die dealing with bureaucracy. The story is realistic and as a viewer we can only identify with the man. Use of computers and email (In Its Infancy In 1985) make the episode cutting edge. yet the central story of a man oppressed by the system resonate today in a human way.

""Eruption"" tells the story of miners being oppressed by a sadistic general manager named John Cove (Played Wonderfully By Mills Watson) who crushes all attempts by the miners to organize against his harsh rules. He blatantly quashes any attempt to unionize against him while at the same time stealing from the miners' pension fund (A Federal Crime). I loved this episode (Also Penned By Chester Krumholz) because it showcased people oppressed by management. At the same time, Mrs. Davenport, from Denver, is oblivious to the harsh practices of John Cove and his cronies. Only the fortuitous eruption of Mount Catherine, the landing of Hawk and Santini in New Gideon and the absence of Cove (On A Hunting & Camping Trip) permit the people to unite and fight for their rights. Secretly James Boden agrees to provide the testimony backed up with the ""cooked books."" When they leave for Denver Chief Crammins sees this and tells Cove who ruthlessly plans to commit murder. Only the intervention of Airwolf prevents their deaths. With Hawke and Santini flying as a team at speeds rivaling the fastest jets, the Hughes choppers had no chance. Cove and all his cronies are subsequently killed and New Gideon gets a new lease on life. Amelia Davenport starts by selecting Mary Avery as Cove's replacement. The people of New Gideon will have a fair shot under new leadership and management that care. The very end shows Nick Cranovich passing out when detailing the birth of his triplets!
