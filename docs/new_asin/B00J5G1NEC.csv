8648284,5,B00J5G1NEC,"For some reason, none of my local stores (Toys R Us, Walmart, Best Buy) will carry Team Umizoomi, and in fact I was told by Toys R Us that they have ""phased out"" all of their products. Why?! This is a very popular show; my daughter has loved it since she was 1 year old.

To those leaving negative reviews based on the fact that this is a duplicate product whose only difference is the slipcase... really? A few minutes of research into the product you are buying would go a long a way to avoiding similar issues in the future. It took me all of a second to recognize that the only difference between this ""version"" of the DVD, and this one: https://www.amazon.com/Team-Umizoomi-Animal-Heroes/dp/B00BHWG1NU/ref=pd_bxgy_74_img_3?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=4X5EW1VCQZ3JM8NVKDGM, are, for some reason, their price, and the fact that one case has a ""School Essentials"" border, while the other one doesn't.

It's a simple thing, too, to Google the individual DVDs to see what episodes are on them, as it is a simple thing to check the other customer reviews here on Amazon to notice that some people have included a list of episodes as part of their review, or have even shared an image of the back of the DVD case.",1475452800,,1204,4.811594202898551
8648285,5,B00J5G1NEC,I bought this for my grandson who loves Team Umizoomi. I couldn't find one in any of the local stores. It's a DVD of 91 minutes of Team Umizoomi. there are 4 episodes in the DVD. The DVD is played over and over again everyday. It's a great learning DVD also. I will be ordering another Team Umizoomi DVD. This is a great way to keep the children occupied.,1463011200,,355,4.159420289855072
