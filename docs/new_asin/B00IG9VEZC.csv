8641940,5,B00IG9VEZC,Erika Jordan And Jazy Berlin In The Same Movie. Incredible. Jazy Sets My Soul On Fire.,1440201600,,86,4.4375
8641941,2,B00IG9VEZC,"Director Dean McKendrick had a chance to make something really creative with this one, but I don't believe that his heart was in it.  The two cover-girls on the DVD boxcover, Jazy Berlin and Erika Jordan, are both incredibly beautiful, as is pretty Christine Nguyen, but the storyline doesn't reflect it.  I didn't expect the guy/girl scenes in this one to be worth watching, and so I wasn't at all disappointed with those.  But where director McKendrick really dropped the ball was with the two girl/girl scenes.  Only two?  Seriously?  Most people I know dearly LOVE watching lesbian scenes, but when you get a director who isn't interested, it shows, and this was one of those instances.  Blonde amazon-warrior Jazy Berlin goes home with cute little Christine Nguyen, but when it comes time for those two to have sex, it falls flat.  Jazy pushes the dark-haired girl down onto the couch, which at least had a bit of a dominant/submissive feel about it, but then they both kind of tentatively go at it, with neither woman playing even the slightest bit of attention to the other's gorgeous behind!  A talented and/or creative director would have made it hot.  This wasn't hot!  The scene with red-haired amazon Erika Jordan and black girl Misty Stone was even worse.  They just begin having sex because they're both in the same locker room together.  It's like director McKendrick just wasn't interested.  He tried much harder with the guy/girl scenes, but I fast-forwarded through all of them.  Where are the writers/directors out there who appreciate girl/girl scenes?  Notice that there are no names of men on the DVD box cover?  Somebody needs to explain why that is to director Dean McKendrick.",1438387200,8,1701,4.891608391608392

8641945,4,B00IG9VEZC,I would love to review this but it will not be released until 22 April 14. Why Amazon doesn't have it available for preorder yet is the mystery. The used copy that is listed for sale is not for this movie as it has never been for sale before.,1395878400,3,242,3.9591836734693877
