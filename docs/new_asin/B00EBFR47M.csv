8603569,5,B00EBFR47M,"I'm so, so incredibly disappointed that this series has ended - it was truly a gem! With undercover intrigue from, for a change, the Canadian perspective and a vantage point of the many roles women had to fulfill during the war both at home and filling in for the men who were off on a battlefield somewhere, this show was well crafted and kept a steady pace. I really wish they had kept it going - but I guess there are too few of us who appreciate a good plot over gratuitous violence and crass vulgarity. So glad this was available on Netflix, otherwise I probably would've missed it - give it a chance!!",1418342400,,607,4.333333333333333
