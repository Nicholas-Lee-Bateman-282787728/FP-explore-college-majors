6656820,5,B00NHG1CBA,"Unless you've been sleeping for a couple years, you know that the skeleton of the English King Richard III has been found, and it shows curvature of the spine. This proves he was not the hunchback Shakespeare portrayed, but it still leaves us with the question posed by Jay O. Sanders, the show's narrator: ""Could a man with such a twisted back wear armor, lead a heavy cavalry charge and kill several men before dying at the hands of Henry Tudor's army?""

When the news that the body was confirmed as Richard's hit the news, one person watching in England was particularly interested. The spine he saw in the photos of the skeleton looked very much like the x-rays of his own back. So Dominic Smee offered to help answer some questions.

They found that Smee's spine is ""virtually identical"" to Richard's, and he volunteered for 3 months of physical training. As Dr. Mitchell says, ""If Dominic can do this, then I'm sure Richard would have managed to do it."" Dominic had to learn to handle a medieval sword, and demonstrate the range of motion needed in battle. He was fitted for a 70-pound medieval suit of armor that compensated and worked with his body. He had to learn how to ride a horse with a medieval wooden saddle. And lastly, he had to ride that horse across a field with a lance and knock off a soldier's head. Being average height and sleight of frame doesn't mean he couldn't have been a fierce warrior: ""Henry's historians credit Richard with unhorsing one of Henry's bodyguards - who was 6 feet 7.""

If you like history, you'll love this stuff, even if you aren't usually into military details. People who study medieval training manuals, for example, know that they trained to fight with two-handed short sword thrusts (no windmilling, which leaves you exposed).

The show covers other aspects of Richard III, also, as it relates to his fighting ability. Like his diet. Bone tests show that Richard had the wealthy medieval man's diet with lots of protein. That's a plus for the rigors of fighting. But the last couple years of his life, while he was king, he went to excess in his diet, including a bottle of wine a day, which wasn't good for staying in fighting trim.

This single disc has 60 minutes of show, presented in widescreen and stereo. You have the option of watching it with English SDH subtitles or DVJ Described Video. There are no DVD extras. Commentators include Bob Woosnam-Savage (curator, Royal Armories Museum), Dr. Piers Mitchell (biological anthropologist), Richard Buckley (archaeologist), Philippa Langley (originator, ""Looking For Richard Project""), Dominic Smee (Richard's body double), Christina Smee (Dominic's mother), Dr. Tobias Capwell (curator, Arms & Armor, The Wallace Collection), Claire Small (physiotherapist), Arne Koets (medieval martial artist), Dr. Angela Lamb (geochemist, British Geological Survey), Per Lillelund (armorer), Dominic Sewell (historical horse trainer), Dr. Richard Thomas (archaeologist) and Dave Rawlings (medieval martial arts instructor).

If you are looking for a book on the discovery of Richard III, I can recommend two. If I could only have one, it would be:

Excellent illustrations and tons of exciting information packed into a slender volume.

I also enjoyed the book by Philippa Langley and Michael Jones:

Langley was the driving force behind the search for Richard III's grave.

""Resurrecting Richard III"" is an entry in the PBS series, ""Secrets of the Dead: When Science and History Collide."" The Richard III episode originally aired 9/24/14. If you haven't caught any other episodes, you might want to catch up. Topics range from ""Ben Franklin's Bones"" to ""The Man Who Saved the World"" (Cuban missile crisis) to the Salem witch trials.

6656821,5,B00NHG1CBA,"As a 20-year member of the Richard III Society, since I was not able to see the original BBC broadcast, this was a mandatory purchase for me. It is an excellent piece of work: an informative presentation admirably directed by Gary Johnstone, and thoughtfully edited. Dominic Smee is charming in his intensity. This is a purchase I have no reason to regret - and would make a great gift for any youngster interested in knights in armor, horses, and the mechanics of training under the code of chivalry. It is also a terrific lesson in overcoming physical adversity and perseverance. The only thing I missed was not hearing the underlying point: Richard began experiencing physical training at age 9 - and by the time the scoliosis had become severe, he had spent a lot of time in overcoming or dealing with the gradual onset of disability. Brave Dominic has not had that advantage, which, in a way, makes his participation even more admirable.",1425600000,14,942,4.785276073619632
6656822,5,B00NHG1CBA,"This 60-minute program, from the Secrets of the Dead series, gives the viewer insight into Richard III's battlefield life and death. The remains, recently found, give us a surprising view of the ""hunchback"" king and how someone with such a disability could have fought in an age when monarchs were still expected to lead their armies from the front.

Resurrecting Richard III very briefly gives the viewer the circumstances of the rediscovery of Richard's remains under a parking lot as well as an equally brief introduction to his career and times during the ""War of the Roses"" between the houses of Lancaster and York. This DVD is not about the discovery or recovery of his bones, but, rather focuses on how a man with a radically-curved spine could have become a renowned warrior.

The bones of the defeated king do give the researchers an idea of his general health but ,most importantly, show how his spine was curved and how that would have affected his life and death. By coincidence, a young Englishman had a condition remarkably similar to Richard III's and agreed to become a test subject of how a man with a condition of that sort would have operated in both life in general and in combat.

The young man, Dominic Smee, began by learning how to fight with weapons and armor of the day. Quickly, it was obvious that Richard, like Dominic, would have had less ability to absorb oxygen since the curvature of the spine interfered with his breathing during cardio exercise (like swinging a sword or war-hammer). However, when mounted, the young Mr. Smee found that his spinal condition did not interfere with mounted combat. It was very surprising that the armor actually helped him in the saddle, giving him great stability on his mount.

I think this is a good video that shows the times, the warfare of the period and, with the assistance of young Dominic, how Richard III could have been a respected fighter and a man to be reckoned with even though handicapped. Five stars.",1424563200,14,1985,4.761627906976744

8678226,5,B00NHG1CBA,"Fabulous. Richard's life story is interspersed with the story of his grave. Needless to say Henry Tudor buried him like a dog. This simply was not done. It's satisfying to see King Richard III get his due. Henry Tudor is the true Usurper, taking the throne by force. The Tudor apologists In This DVD keep dragging out Thomas Moore and his ""history"" . Thomas Moore grew up in Bishop Morton's household. Bishop Morton's was imprisoned in the tower by Duke Richard and was his sworn enemy. Well, now you know.",1487548800,,506,4.633333333333334

The DVD starts with the discovery of the bones and looks at scientific analysis of the bones to tell what Richard ate throughout his life and what sort of shape he was in. The story really focuses on whether or not the accounts of Richard's last battle could have been accurate given his scoliosis. Remarkably, the documentary team was able to find a modern ""body double"" who had a very similar spine and build. Although he was *already a Medieval re-enactor,* they taught him to fight in the style of the times and outfitted him in period gear to test whether or not Richard III could have been a warrior. That footage is interesting and hasn't been shared all over the internet. However, I think the overall effect was just okay because it was not new.",1451174400,,836,4.470588235294118
