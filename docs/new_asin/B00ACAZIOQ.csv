8549976,3,B00ACAZIOQ,"I watched this show while it was on Netflix and fell in love with the music and hats. I found a cheap copy (~$20) here on Amazon, fully suspecting that it would be questionable.

The copy that I bought is two discs (the series is 22 hours total, by the way, meaning there are 11 hours on each disc) and the compression is ridiculous. Very noticeable both in the picture and the audio. The packaging is in Korean with some poor English here and there, with the MBC (the channel that originally aired the show) logo in a few places. I'm guessing that they had no part in the making of this DVD. As far as I can tell, the DVD is region-free, but I had problems playing it on multiple players. The format is mysterious  HDVD-9  which, from what I can gather, is some weird high compression format that is used in the Chinese market. For practical purposes, it's like any other standard def DVD. I have had success playing the DVDs on a Sony BDP-S370 and a Toshiba SDK1000.

The first thing you see when you pop in the disc is a big THX logo. Yeah, right. Audio is in Korean or Chinese. Subtitles are available in simplified and traditional Chinese, as well as English (no Korean). I can't speak to the quality of the Chinese subtitles, but the English is atrocious. An example of a typical conversation:

""Is not to sell why fled""
""Those who caught Do not I excited""
""What did you say""
""Joke joke But I know you can not harm a great man""
""Thank you so understand me""

The seller was up front about the bad subtitles, thankfully. The quality of the picture, audio, and translation quality are not even the worst part of this DVD, though: there is always an ""MBC HD"" watermark at the top right corner, and every now and then a ticker tape graces the bottom of the screen in Korean. Maybe the video was ripped from the television when the show aired on MBC, and the ticker is an advertisement or something. Or a copyright warning. I really don't know.

Other than that, the authoring seems fine. The menu screen has ""Play All, ""Episodes,"" ""Resume,"" and ""Set Up."" Everything functions as it should, and Set Up is just language options.

tl;dr: Only works on select players, looks and sounds like a turd, English subtitles are incomprehensible. Check to make sure that you're getting the real deal first and that the total number of discs is ordinate to what a 22 hour series should require.",1440720000,,2382,4.459770114942529
