7844686,1,6303327958,CHEESY. STUPID. MEANINGLESS. BOOGER SUCKS!!! HOW COULD THEY RUIN PART 3???,1126396800,,74,5.818181818181818
7844687,3,6303327958,"Booger (Curtis Armstrong) and expectant father Louis (Robert Carradine) reunite with most of the gang for Booger's nuptials with nice rich girl Jennie (Corrinne Bohrer).  Trouble is, her father (Joseph Bologna) and sleazy brother-in-law (Stephen Davies) have other ideas.  Made-for-TV movie is better than expected with some likable characters, despite lack of raunchiness that made the original film so popular.",1008547200,2,412,5.85
7844688,4,6303327958,"This is the best of the series,(except for 1 of course) and should be purchased if you liked the first one. lots of laughs.  A good time",993859200,,136,4.037037037037037
7844689,1,6303327958,"This was, without a doubt, the worst ROFTN. I was particularly dissapointed with Curtis Armstrong's performance as Booger. He's not the  vulgar, greasy outcast we all fell in love with in ROFTN. Instead, he's  gentler and more politically correct. He claims, in the movie, that hiring  a female dancer for his bachelor party, would be sexist. While in the first  movie, through the use of a spy camera, he and the other nerds watch  sorrority girls undress all night long. Without the swearing, the movie  really isn't funny at all. And now Ogre and Stan are nerds! This movie  didn't live up to the original's standards AT ALL.",967939200,,628,4.7592592592592595
7844690,4,6303327958,"I think it's a given that the Revenge of the Nerd series is not Citizen Kane. Having said that, I have to say I love the RofN movies. For the first time, nerds, geeks, dweebs and other maladroit types (like me!) are getting  their own back.
The Fourth of the series did not win an Acadamy Award nor  was it shown at Cannes. On the other hand, I bust a gut laughing whenever I  watch it, and I predict you will as well.",963446400,,418,4.0120481927710845
7844691,3,6303327958,"This flick was at times funny, but mostly just bland with bad acting.  Perhaps a few drinks would have spiced this movie up for the viewer.  The movie wasn't disappointing because the movie-goer went knowing the film  would be pretty bad.  Well, it was a little better than bad...barely!",960854400,2,287,4.795918367346939
