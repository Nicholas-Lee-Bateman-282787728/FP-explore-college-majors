4320580,4,B004BVA8S8,"Assassin of the Tsar brings to the screen the story of a doctor who is drawn from Moscow to a small town in Russia in order ""to practice psychiatry once again,"" or so he thinks...
The setting is post-Stalinist USSR and a feel of liberalism is in the air.  The newly arrived psychiatrist from Moscow is intrigued by one schizophrenic patient in particular who believes he murdered Tsar Alexander II in 1881 and Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 as two distinct killers (!).  What he finds out might be more than he bargained for...

On the positive side:
1) The plot (and the twist therein) is definitely original and opens a window into glorious Russia.
2) A strong sense of History is all about.
3) Shot on location it provides for some noteworthy scenery.
4) The costumes are great!
5) A very accurate portrayal of the USSR of the time (i.e. the overall mood, way of life, conditions, setting etc)

On the negative side:
1) The acting/directing could have been better (e.g. Empress Alexandra should have had a German, not a Russian accent), though Malcolm McDowall and Oleg Yankovsky do a great job with their multiple roles.
2) The film is too slow at times.

In short, the plot, the dialogues, the setting, and the costumes are great.
The film is a cross between Nicholas & Alexandra, the X-Files, and Spider; a combination that surprises, and yet works out fine!
Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! Highly recommended for those with a soft spot for History and all things Russian, along with the masterpieces Doctor Zhivago and the Barber of Siberia.  3 1/2 Stars",1146614400,37,1657,4.716262975778546

_____________________________
Here's one of those weird, rewarding films with a premise so berserkly bizarre you can't help but watch! I was pleasantly surprised by this historic curio, that for a couple of reasons, doesn't quite fall into the B-movie bucket like the several *what happened if the Nazis had won WWII* films, several of which seem to feature Gregory Peck attempting to rule the world from a hideout in Brazil.

This is worlds and octaves of marvelous quality far from that genre. It's also not an action movie. And yet...somehow ASSASSIN OF THE TSAR manages not to fall prey to the one-trick pony trap, either.

First, there's the acting: every single role, every line is superbly acted. I like weird indie dramas, strange stories, and will tolerate B-movie acting for the sake of a truly weird story; but given all that, it was astonishing to find the superb acting here.  Oscar-level performances is what you get, not even taking into account that, likely, most actors don't speak English. The nuances and subtleties of expression in English were all there, perfectly directed, too. Then there was the beautiful mix of Russian accents, vintage, most likely, that so many of us American movie watchers and folks with Russian heritage enjoy.

The lighting and cinematography were a visual feast: warm golds and ochre, silvery snow and grey stone cityscapes. Some of the scenes were apparently filmed in the historic locations, and that's fascinating to me. When I was a kid, c. 1970s, there was a flurry of films re-released or redone from the 50s and '60s about the Romanov Princess Anastasia; two different women, each with their various partisans and political sponsors factions, and Cold War era espionage projects, who strongly resembled and claimed to be the Romanov Princess, last survivor of the assassination of the Czar, family, and retainers in Ekaterinberg.

Pacing, that's a bit problematic in this movie. Give up your expectations of anything less than a masterful European art film c. 1970. Let it wash over you and enjoy the quiet, thoughtful weirdness. Still, the one thing that could've improved this amazing, absolutely unique little film is the middle, which could've definitely used better pacing. But that's not terribly different from the problem with most big-budget mainstream movies, either.

Great film for history buffs, actors, directors. And probably, for Russians. Fans of early 70s film legend Malcolm McDowell [Kubrik's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE scifi classic] will be rewarded, too.

I strongly recommend psychotherapists take a look at this speculative fiction, lo-fi, slow paced ""thriller"" and enjoy the extravagance of the mind f*** represented here.

And still, you wonder if this film is also, not just a fine film, but also the complicated result of a Russian nationalist project to win hearts and minds...",1430956800,5,2882,5.169527896995708
4320602,4,B004BVA8S8,It is an intellectual movie. Thoughtful. I enjoyed it.,1430697600,,54,5.111111111111111

4320605,2,B004BVA8S8,"I find it hard to believe anyone would give this movie over 2 stars. Its slow,, boring and the acting is mediocre at best. I had to turn it off.",1425513600,,144,3.8333333333333335
4320606,4,B004BVA8S8,"This is an interesting and thought provoking film about a schizophrenic man who believes he was the assassin of two Russian Tsars; akin to those who believe they are Christ, Satan or any number of compelling personas.

Do such people manifest these fantasies psychologically and or even physically; as in cases of persons who claim to suddenly bear Stigmata, the wounds of Christ because it's a way to bolster an inadequacy in their self image or is it ""mere"" randomly selected delusion.

I personally don't believe these delusions to be random because I think that there is some deeply rooted conflict or desire in the sub conscience  that  must be so extremely powerful in order to overwhelm the sanity of an individual; so sayeth this layman who has no background in such matters.

The story of the assassination of the last Tsar Nicholas is a well known story; one that has grown to mythic proportions over the years, so it's not surprising that this man would be able to re-enact in his mind all the details of the butchering off the Imperial family.

He does, however, reveal an inconsistency when he claims that those who were not killed by the rain of bullets were then finished off with bayonets; later he succumbs to the famous ""Anastasia"" legend when he says that he did not finish her off and wonders about her whereabouts.

This film has merit and Malcolm McDowell can always be depended upon for a solid performance.
The story could have been further developed in any number of directions but since it was only scratches the surface, it leaves you wanting for more a more substantial ending and resolution. But perhaps that might be the point because there is no simple and easy resolution to a story of this kind; if there is even a resolution at all.",1424476800,,1766,4.6957928802588995

4320608,4,B004BVA8S8,"Once you get past the rather clunky dramatic device of an asylum inmate drawing a doctor into his delusion, the interplay between the primary characters I found fascinating.  The possibility of two living people sharing memories of two dead people is ludicrous, however the ability to re-imagine the thought processes of the last Tsar and his killer, as historic events unfold, offered insight into how real people under real circumstances might think and act; to see both the Tzar and his killer as human. The mediocrity who thinks he will become famous, and the ruler who finds that his time is over, pulled on toward a future neither understands.",1420761600,2,649,4.954128440366972

4320619,4,B004BVA8S8,"A film in large part about identity. What happens when we see ourselves as figures of Authority, as the Oppressed or as Idealists. Another reviewer thought the minor character of the mother who has lost her daughter had no significance. But the patient who thinks he was the Czar's assassin may have ""mistakenly"" assassinated the woman's daughter though he insists he did not. This minor narrative arc is another device by which to highlight the potential pitfalls of too close and unquestioning an identification with the ideals of the revolutionary spirit. The madman is patently delusional but then so was the actual Assassin and so was the Czar. And so is the doctor who, in a sense, chooses to ""assassinate"" characters. Granted, these are characters he deems to be ill (though as R.D.Laing first noted in the 60's, schizophrenia, though a dangerous process, is none the less a creative one that often leads to Wholeness). The older, retired Doctor seems the only truly self realized character. At one point, when discussing the patient, he asks the young doctor, What is normal? The quiet, measured pace of the film, the low light, the mists and clouds all foster that feeling of reflection that adds such richness of the film.",1402358400,4,1232,4.927884615384615
4320620,5,B004BVA8S8,"A good subject matter for any historical event, this views Russian history from another perspective and also brings in a cultural role for ""mental illness"". The acting was quite good. The script moves a bit slow and sometimes a little confusing at the beginning, but picks up speed.  I wanted someone in the script to be investigating what the main patient was saying from a historical value.  The older head of psychiatry brought that aspect to a point of clarity and so kept the show rolling. Not a show for relaxing or for resolution.  It is a show for perspective shifts and human illumination.",1399766400,,598,4.730769230769231
