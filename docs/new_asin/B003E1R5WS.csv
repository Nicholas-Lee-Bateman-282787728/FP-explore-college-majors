4112648,4,B003E1R5WS,"Well sure, the budget is low, the acting has tounges firmy in cheeks. The attack jet squadron is a flight of antiques with visible pantylines (I mean wires). But c'mon!!! The Japanese SDF has a Gorgon Monster Death Ray Unit!!!! And, our heroine - the pop-singer temple maid - can apparently survive a nuclear explosion without ruffeling her kimono. I hugely enjoyed this slice of very ripe cheese. Just keep the kappa's cranial plate well moistened and all will be well.",1286236800,,470,4.814814814814815
4112649,3,B003E1R5WS,"""DEATH KAPPA"", well, the title certainly grabbed me! A ""kappa', for those who aren't enlightened, is a type of ""yokai""(spirit/goblin, etc) in Japanese mythology. It is like a cross between a man, turtle, and a bird, and known for a fondness for cucumbers. It also has a sort of ""dish"" on its head which holds water, the source of the creature's power.
""Death Kappa"" is a modern take on this myth.
It seems that there has been a nuclear war, and the fallout has created many mutations, including a giant sea monster called
Hangloyas, or something like that, which of course goes on the rampage.
A cute young pop-singer girl has ties to the kappa through her grandmother who is hit by a car and killed. After the fact, the kappa appears, and shows an immediate fondeness for the young girl's singing.
When hopes of stopping the other monster fail, the kappa grows to giant size...DEATH KAPPA, and battles the other monster to the death.
The movie is amusing, but rather uneven. It seems to be a kind of subtle parody of other japanese monster flicks. It is full of bizarre, rather psychotic characters, and the story seems to alternate between really slow scenes to action.
The special effects may have been done on the cheap intentionally if it is a satire. Hangyolas""s ""rampage' really isn't that impressive, and the miniatures are not that impressive, either. Both monster suits are not bad, but they don't have much personality. Effects look more like something out of one of the older ""ultraman"" shows, but that is where the amusement comes in; anyone like myself that loved the ultraman shows will probably like this because of the campiness. Only problem is the battle between the monsters isn't very exciting; not enough mayhem.
This could have been really good and fun if the filmakers focused more on the action and better character development.
All in all, not a bad movie if you don't have high expectations for it!",1285891200,6,1925,4.766467065868263
4112650,4,B003E1R5WS,"Death Kappa actually was a very funny movie to me.
 I was able to see a preview of it last weekend and I found it very entertaining. If you are a fan of Kaiju then you will love it. Some moments don't gel together as I may have liked but as the movie goes on and you see some of the effects you begin to feel the aura of the film. I think in the end it resinated more like a dark comedy in some ways. However I am anxious to see it again and myself and the other 20+ people around me all were having a great time watching it.
A fun movie all in all",1279065600,4,548,3.6837606837606836
4112651,1,B003E1R5WS,"I am a huge Kaiju fan. This movie is one of the worst I have seen. It is kind of a cross between the new Japanese ""Machine Girl"" type horror movie with much less charm (no Machine Girl character), and a classic giant monster film. IT IS NOT A CLASSIC KAIJU FILM! Whatever the film makers vision was, they failed to get it across, unless that vision was of a complete an utter unintelligible and unenjoyable mess!

<<<SPOILERS BELOW>>>
I got the DVD/Blu-Ray Combo, and in the blu-ray every single wire on every flying object is visible. I do not know if this was intentional. There are tons of digs in here at the Japanese military and Japanese men in general. Fighter pilots wearing eye shadow for no reason, soldiers too afraid to fire their guns... none of it makes sense. It's almost as if the film makers agree with the neo-Nazi villains, and think that Japan has become too soft. I wish they would have let us in on the joke. Continuity is almost non-existent. The giant monsters appear almost magically after an atomic explosion without explanation, just a narrator saying something like ""Oops, they shouldn't have done that!"" The hero girl (who was at Ground Zero of the atomic blast), shows up at the end to save the day without even so much as a dirty face.",1424390400,,1266,4.528384279475983

4112653,4,B003E1R5WS,"Death Kappa is a very self-aware parody of classic kaiju movies. Some people might prefer the originals to something that's clearly trying to be a B-movie, but I still found it to be enjoyable. The humor is very Japanese, but it's better than a lot of the boring human drama that took up 75% of most Godzilla movies in my opinion.

Unfortunately, it still has the problem that so many giant-monster-fighting movies have- taking too long to get to the monsters fighting, and having them not fight for very long. A little more than half way through, a Godzilla-type monster shows up and starts rampaging though a city. Then it keeps rampaging for 20 minutes, and the whole time you're waiting for the Kappa to show up. When he does, the fight is great and funny, though it only lasts for about 10 minutes. The Kappa himself makes for a cool kaiju in this scene, using wrestling moves and just having a great time. I would've liked to have seen the Kappa fight some other monsters as well, or for the one fight to last longer, at least.

It may have been better if it at least appeared to take itself seriously, which is what makes real B-movies fun to watch in the first place, but all in all, the enjoyable parts make this a fun watch for fans of classic kaiju movies.",1413676800,3,1267,4.4334763948497855

4112655,2,B003E1R5WS,"A giant reptilian monster threatens Japan after group of crazed scientists unleash nuclear devastation over the land, and it is up to the kappa of ancient legend to save the world in DEATH KAPPA! Rather than paying homage to the classic Kaiju era in a reverent satire, DEATH KAPPA reduces itself to an idiotic spoof that is continually brought down by its sophomoric screenplay and dulled sense of humor. Director Tomo'o Haraguchi intentionally reveals the wires carrying the model planes, the false backdrops, and the cheapness of his scale miniatures for laughs, but each weakened attempt to poke fun at the genre falls flat due to the poor production quality and complete lack of wit. The horrendous costume designs for the two leading monsters do nothing to help, either. What we are left with is a muddled, disjointed mess of a film that is an embarrassment to Kaiju fans everywhere.

This movie is so out there, your reviewer was torn between awarding it one star out of disgust, or five stars for the sheer surrealistic nerve it must have taken to have made this movie in the first place.  Roughly speaking, you can divide it into two parts (with an annoying narrator segueing you through each part and then some).  The first half of the movie borrows heavily from the Manga/Anime' approach.  The pacing and certain character reactions are almost cartoonish, and yes, very over the top.  But that's nothing when you get to the second part of the movie.  Then it becomes a parody of the old-school Godzilla movies, especially the motifs from Mothra.

4112659,5,B003E1R5WS,"Although this has been trounced by fans of the genre, I enjoyed it a lot.  It's like an insane episode of Power Rangers:  granddaughter of an Imperial Japanese scientist runs a neo-fascist squad of mutant fish soldiers, she is opposed by our heroine, a failed J-Pop singer who returns to her small town and is befriended by Kappa.  Kappa is like a friendly goblin who enjoys fresh cucumbers.  Needless to say, there is a nuclear explosion resulting in a giant Kappa battling giant Fish Mutant.  The monster suits, and the battle itself, are done quite well.  Nevertheless, this production is ridiculous! --featuring a J-Pop musical number, old lady murder, and giant cucumber airlifts.  Absolutely glorious... and bad. =-)

Fans of serious giant monster movies have the Criterion Collection release of Godzilla, for those who enjoy a can of ""Cheez Whiz"" with their monsters, Death Kappa delivers.",1334448000,5,896,5.089041095890411
4112660,2,B003E1R5WS,"I bought this movie in a store. It was advertised as a straight kaiju eiga (monster movie) but it absolutely is not that. Rather, it takes all the qualities of the Godzilla and Gamera movies of the 60s and 70s and either mocks them or subverts them. Plus it adds in a dose of mockery for 50's American monster movies, splashes in some mock John Woo gore, and adds a bunch of cackling villains whom the heroine reacts to by shouting ""You're insane"" about a hundred times (as if that would help).

The first half of the movie is goofy but not funny.  It opens with a bald white guy sitting at a desk labeled, if I remember right, ""Dr. Serizawa"" (he's the scientist who killed Gojira) lecturing the audience about the penalties of ignoring mythical monsters. We then meet the heroine, a former pop singer returning to her home village because she has realized that she has ""absolutely no talent."" She is played by Misato Hirata, who, judging from a Google image search, is primarily an underwear model. She is really very cute and plays the role straight. In a scene of mock pathos, her grandmother is killed by a group of youths riding around in a convertible shouting incoherently. About forty minutes in, the heroine is kidnapped and gets into the hands of the wack villains, who range from a bitter parody of the late insane ultranationalist Yukio Mishima to an insane mad scientist's granddaughter who pushes her grandfather's mummy around in a wheelchair in a way that I personally found revolting. The kappa, which earlier was dancing about as badly as a child in a heavy padded suit can dance, arrives and starts with the sumotori and other martial arts. trying to save the day.

Then an atomic bomb goes off with some ludicrous, ludicrous, LUDICROUS special effects.

Then any attempt at plot consistency is discarded as a dumb-looking suitmation monster called Hangyolas rampages through a city. Here the movie comments on the Toho tradition in various ways that, although clever, seem like a series of slaps to someone like me who likes the older movies despite their known faults. I won't list all the jokes or the mockery, but there is a lot of it, focused partly on exposing the cheesy model work and the wires, partly on making fun of the Japanese Self-Defense Force, partly on making fun of the older movies. I'm not sure exactly how funny it is in Japan to have a whole unit of soldiers holding up their rifles but unable to fire at the monster because they are all too afraid, or how funny it is to have a jet pilot wearing eye shadow, or how funny it is repeatedly to show an officer with a severe overbite who looks like a bad stereotype of a mentally retarded person. I was stunned, but I didn't laugh. I felt that this humor was nasty and vicious all the way through.

Other reviewers have complained in their Death Kappa reviews about Dai Nipponjin/Big Man Japan. I don't get all the topical Japanese-culture reference in that movie, but it is subtle and character-driven and has plot consistently up until the last fifteen minutes. I didn't find it mean-spirited like Death Kappa.",1326672000,5,3101,4.651459854014599

Big man japan wasn't horrid but it was slow drawn out and was just wierd, demeking was utterly pointless and was just a stupid dream sequence. this is the only movie that had cool monsters that faught and reminded me of my childhood. Especially when they faught using the big ball, instant godzilla vs ebirah flashback... id give thus movies a five stars just for suceeding where others failed but honestly its more of a 3.5 or a 4",1312588800,,805,4.337748344370861

Intentionally bad special effects and all this winking at the camera and over-acting, and just plain bad writing makes DEATH KAPPA annoying and undercuts any attempt at humor.

Addendum: I was quite unaware of the director's other films and the fact that this is meant to be a comedy.

If you can survive the silly, over-the-top and ridiculous beginning of the film (I could barely tolerate Kappa dancing), you are in for subpar kaiju film. Once the monster mayhem starts, the film picks up a little. The blatant fake tanks and cars are hilarious though. The spotlights shining on the ""wall"" on the set behind the monsters and everything else in-between is hilarious as well. They even do the tail rip off stuff like something off of Ultraman. I have the import blu-rays of ""Long And Dark-Haired Monster Gehara"" (which is awesome and blows away ""Death Kappa"") and ""Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle The Movie"". The CGI Godzilla at the beginning of ""Always Sunset On Third Street 2"" is phenomenal. Gojira even has the all-white eyes like in GMK.

Things go badly when the girl and the kappa are kidnapped by insane secret agents and a trio of deadly aquatic mutants. Things become worse still when an atomic bomb is set off and the kappa and a remaining water mutant mutates in the giant monsters Death Kappa and Hangyolas...

I was highly, highly dissapointed by this movie. As one who has watched Godzilla and Gamera films since he was about five, I was a bit amped up for a brand new Japanese kaiju flick coming straight to America so fast, especially since movies like ""Deepsea Monster Reigo vs The Battleship Yamamoto"" and ""Deepsea Monster Reiga"" don't seem to be showing up anytime soon; likewise with the Godzilla and Gamera franchises. I just have to ask: Why the childish, self-aware parody atmosphere? This isn't a loving homage as was implied by the director; it's more like if some prick saw two or three Godzilla movies and managed to round up $2 million just to sarcastically poke fun at all things kaiju and sci-fi-related. We have characters mugging at the camera, laughing at the top of their lungs, mutant ninja fishmen, inbreds, jet pilots wearing eyeliner, and characters literally just tossed aside, forgotten. NONE of this ever happened in the classics, so why all this idiodic parody?! Why make fun of something you supposedly admire? What ticked me off the worst were the special FX; wires are clearly (on purpose) holding the monsters' tails and the model jets and the like. This was always proffesionally handeled; rarely would the wires ever be visible!

Having ranted, there were a few minor details about this film I did enjoy. The kappa and Hangyolas suits were memorable and well-designed, and their fight scene in the city, though occasionally a bit too silly as well as anitclimactic, was still pretty entertaining. Then we have the sound effects. A great deal of what we hear are old-school Toho-style sound FX, from the sizzling ray of the much-welcomed death cannon to the footstomps of the monsters, from the Godzilla-styled sound of the kappa spitting his BLUE atomic breath to the whirring of a helicoptor's engine, it all managed to bring a smirk to my face. Lastly, I'd like to mention a running joke in which everytime someone dies horribly, they tend to yell ""Mommy!"". I don't know why, but I just got a kick out of that.

Overall, despite a few fun and nostalgic moments here and there, I was sorely dissapointed by this movie's goofy, odd, self-aware, and sometimes just plain idiotic parody atmosphere, all of this coming from a guy who proudly owns all the Godzilla movies.",1286323200,16,2731,4.818763326226013
