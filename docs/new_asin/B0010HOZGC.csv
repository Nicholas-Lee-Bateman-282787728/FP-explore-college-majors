8237824,5,B0010HOZGC,"i think its about a 30 minute DVD, but it has an option to do ""repeat play"".  while i don't use the TV as a babysitter, it is nice to keep him on the couch and away from the dishwasher while i try to load.",1401321600,,205,3.5555555555555554
8237825,5,B0010HOZGC,"Sweet little video that has a homegrown feel. Lively and upbeat without being annoying. The adults in the house enjoy joining in watching, too.  It's nice that it can be set on repeat playback. My babies love listening to the fun classic kids' songs like Old Macdonald and are enthralled watching little kids and babies in many settings including playing with colorful bouncy balls, gently holding adorable puppies and kittens,  jumping around on the playground and even petting animals at the petting zoo. Cute and colorful with kids ""next door"" of all ethnicities and even a child with a medical problem, teaching differences are normal and natural. I will be looking into more videos made by this company, and am very pleased with this production.",1319673600,,750,4.992
8237826,5,B0010HOZGC,"My granddaughter (now 21 months) has been watching Little Friends since she was about 6 or 7 months.  She absolutely LOVES this video and wants me to play it for her over and over again!  She also loves the Baby Genius DVDs, but she will sometimes bring Little Friends to me while one of those are on and say ""play"".  I am ordering the other two in this series as well.",1313625600,,369,4.169014084507042
8237827,5,B0010HOZGC,Little Playdates where have you been my whole life!!!  The Little Friends DVD is hands down the best baby dvd out there!!! My son was crying uncontrollably the other night - my husband and I couldn't do anything for him. Finally we had the brilliant idea to try Little Friends.  Not 5 seconds into the show he stopped crying and sat mesmerized the entire time.  As soon as the show ended he started crying again so we played it again!!!  Highly recommend Little Friends to anyone with very young children.,1312848000,,505,4.5777777777777775
8237828,5,B0010HOZGC,"My 11 month old loves this it is the only way I am able to get anything done. The baby einstein and baby genius didn't interest her at all, but she will sit through this twice. She doesn't even cry to get out of the playpen. For me it was a lifesaver.",1218326400,,251,3.8461538461538463
