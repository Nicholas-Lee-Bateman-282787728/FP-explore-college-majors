7943484,4,B00005KCBC,"I recently rewatched this movie, and I do have to say first off, Gregg Araki's movies are not for everyone. They all are a bit strange. To me, Totally F ed Up is one of his better films. To me, this has some plot line to it, as in comparison to The Doom Generation (don't get me wrong I do love that movie but it's random.) I don't want to be biased here, so I will point out some cons first. The flashing numbers/titles through out the film were a bit distracting and did confuse me a bit. And the end happened so quickly. Yes, James Duval's character Andy was cynical, and a bit sad throughout the movie but I didn't expect that to happen. I was yelling ""NO"" at my TV screen. This movie was good, but sad. I do love James Duval, and I enjoy that Araki uses some of the same actors throughout his films. However, it's a bit sad that horrible things always happen to Duval's characters, he's quite a good actor and adorable. (Especially in this movie.)
But on another note, if you liked this and you've never seen other Araki films watch Splendor and The Living End next, to me those have good story lines/plots to them. Then I'd say try The Doom Generation and Nowhere if you also liked those. And I'm saying watch Mysterious Skin last because to me that is my most favorite out of all the movies he directed, and has the best story line. It was based off a book, and was not entirely his own creation so I'm saying watch this last so you don't have too high of expectations for the other films.
I'm not great at explaining things, but I hope this helps a bit!",1383264000,,1561,4.224080267558528
7943485,4,B00005KCBC,"Gregg Araki is a well known director for his controversial take on youth and homosexuality. There seems to be, however, a certain thematic present in most of his movies. ""Totally F***ed Up"", along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doom-Generation/dp/1573624039/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doom Generation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nowhere/dp/B00009KOY5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nowhere</a>, is part of what one might denominate the James Duval Era or as the director has named it: ""Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy"". In these movies, the actor interprets different versions of the same character: a confused young man exploring his sexuality and trying to find his place in the world. It may sound predictable, but when one is in front of a Gregg Araki's production nothing is predictable.

It would be unfair to claim that James Duval's character is the protagonist, certainly ""Totally F***ed Up"" is planned and executed as a polyphonic and multivalent narrative, and from the very beginning it showcases a cast of young people sharing their voices and thoughts with the spectator. They're all main characters, and that's part of the film's charm. Polyphony, as literary critic Bakhtin would explain it, implies a diversity of point of views and voices, there is not a unique vision but multiple visions. This goes beyond a simple angle change or a reinterpretation of an act from another character's perspective. Bakhtin said that no human voice could exist in itself, that in order for one human voice to exist other voices (dozens or thousands, the amount doesn't alter the equation) would be indispensable. According to his conception, truth is not what most people agree on, but rather a set of affirmations subtly linked with one another, even if sometimes they would appear to harbor contradictions or inconsistencies.

It is in this sense that ""Totally F***ed Up"" is a polyphonic story. It entangles and exploits the lives of gay and lesbian teenagers. It merges conflict, sexuality and teen angst in one solid narrative. At moments it may rely too much on experimental approaches, but it catches the attention of the viewer from the first image. And it's that first image that functions as the prophecy from the Oracle of Delphi in Greek tragedies. However a prediction of something that will only happen in the last minutes is only fitting in an scenario in which sometimes the characters act like chorus members in a classic Greek tragedy. The chorus was essential for Greek tragedy because it allowed spectators to become emotionally involved while at the same time remain intellectually separated and removed from the theatric reenactment. The chorus is the one voice, pronounced by many, that tells the spectator when to shed a tear or when to sigh in relief, it accompanies the cathartic process but gives full power to the spectator, allowing him to disconnect himself at any time.

These young homosexuals live in constant frustration. Whether it is the impossibility of the lesbian couple to raise a child together, or the impending cheating that shatters the gay couple, or the father's prejudice that ends up in the expulsion of his own son, or the inability of young Andy (James Duval) to define what it is he wants. Because, after all, Andy is not only struggling against his own insecurities and fears, he is also fighting against the structures, against what Lacan would call ""reality""; it's perfectly understandable, then, that the ugliness of the Lacanian ""real"" should erupt in Andy's life. Classic Psychoanalytic theory used to say that homosexuality was the symbolic death of the individual, that due to the wrongfulness of their sexuality, homosexuals were dead in the eyes of society, and forever condemned to be outcasts. ""Totally F***ed Up"" is full of moments in which the spectator can contrast these kids experiences against the ideas and acts of other people, from the Southern politician that compares a gay pride to a march to hell, to the ads that insist AIDS is divine punishment, to the murderer of a gay man that says it's better to have one dead guy than one living gay, to the group of gay bashers that attack one of the main characters, etc.

It's all there, the chorus stratagem that reunites a Bakhtinian polyphonic truth and the frustration that comes from this traditional psychoanalytical accusation of symbolic death, that at last proves that one single man, one individual's fierce fight against reality, is not enough and can be sadly condemned to the grimmest fate.",1317686400,,4631,5.348422496570644
7943486,4,B00005KCBC,"This does what it claims, it is fifteen sort of linked films, set in LA in the eighties. It is amongst the first groundbreaking, `tell it like it is,' real life, gay pieces of cinema. It chooses as its subjects a mixed bag of troubled teens, and starts off with them talking about the high rate of suicide in teenage gays and it is being encouraged by the likes of music by `The Cure' and more worryingly - `The Smiths'!

There are a number of pieces to camera using a variety of different cameras and therefore the quality jumps around even more than the narrative. The sound quality leaves a fair bit to be desired too and requires your full attention to ensure not missing anything.

It is quite dated in a really good way, for those that lived through the eighties, there will be so much here that you had forgotten, like the huge brick mobiles and dial up sex lines  - excellent! There are loads of comic or even com-tragic moments; lets face it a scene based around two lesbians in a room full of `donor' gay guys and a turkey baster is fairly hard to categorize. Then there is teenage `street wisdom', like ""love lasts as long as a squirt in the dark""..

There is a great piece where they discuss who is a fanciable screen god/star and their top three are Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise and Michael Stipe. In a very Bruce La Bruce way there are lots of questions or statement flashed up on the screen, and this film does ask far more question than it ever set out to answer - that really is part of its hidden charm. That I feel was the intention of Director Gregg Araki (Mysterious Skin and Kaboom being two more well known later works) who shows as much of the film making process as what it results in.

This is a montage of films and that can be distracting as it acts as an alienation device from getting too close to the characters or the action.  This is still an essential piece of cinema in the ever growing panoply of gay cinema and should be lauded for that. It will not be to everybody's taste and can be (rightly) accused of being too long, but there is enough here to keep you entertained. One of my favourites is going to a gig by the `legendary' `Kamikaze Dildo's'. It is also a massive trip down eighties memory lane, with AIDS as a spectre of doom hanging over seventies hedonism culture. If original and groundbreaking gay cinema is one of your things then you really ought to check out the fantastic `Taxi zum Klo' and /or `Nighthawks', I am sure you will enjoy them too.",1313020800,,2490,4.344086021505376

7943488,2,B00005KCBC,"Totally [title censored for amazon consumption] Up (Gregg Araki, 1993)

What gets me about Gregg Araki's movies is that same thing that gets me about a lot of movies that the world seems to embrace with such fervor: the shallowness of the emotions therein. (Most recently, viz. Twilight.) James Duval's low-rent-Keanu-Reeves shtick is a lot of fun for, roughly, ten minutes, but the one-note delivery gets really old really quickly. That his part is written that way makes it no less tedious to watch.

Duval plays Andy, the central character of an ensemble cast that explores the gay dating scene in the early nineties. Amusingly, while Duval is the only cast member who has gone onto notable success, he's probably the actor who stands out least here; everyone else around him is more interesting and more vibrant, despite everyone affecting a world-weary attitude that Araki's script takes pains to ensure we understand they don't really feel (though the actors never really get across the subtleties inherent in playing such a role in such a way). Either the film's many thousands of fans simply ignore the emotional disconnect of the film, don't understand that an emotional disconnect exists, or both; I don't see how it's avoidable. Worse, when the movie does attempt to connect with the audience on an emotional level, it devolves into mawkishness and melodrama, especially in the painfully over-the-top climax.

To be fair, in hindsight, Araki did get better; The Doom Generation is miles better than this (and much of that has to do with Duval, whose character there actually has some sort of animation). This is worth sitting through if you were part of the scene at the time (perhaps; I was, and I didn't find it so) and/or you're a fan of The Doom Generation, to which this serves as a sort-of prequel; otherwise, it's safely avoidable. **",1233964800,2,1852,4.92948717948718

7943491,4,B00005KCBC,"Tracing the progress of innovative filmmakers is a pleasure for movie buffs.  Gregg Araki developed a unique voice in film in the early 1990s (this film dates back to 1993), a voice that maintained a sense of immediacy with his actors who he directed with his hand held camera in a manner that gave the illusion that the 'script' was extemporaneous.  Careful not to assign controversial roles to inadequate talent, Araki gathered a group of young actors and pulled the very best from them.  Many of these early actors still maintain presence in Araki's prolific flow of films.

As is so often the case with Araki's stories, TOTALLY F***ED UP deals with gay sensibilities in a way that displays the entire spectrum of positive and negative response to his characters. He does not preach: he simply voyeuristically reveals lifestyles as though he were a hidden personage who just happened to fall into private moments and turbulent emotions.  In this film Araki divides the examination of six teenage gay kids (four boys and two girls) into 15 dialogues, each representing an aspect of what faces his characters and how they cope with being on the fringe.  The 15 episodes are related because the characters remain the same and it is this unique manner of making his story that has continued to be a trait of Araki's later, more linear films.

We meet each of the six characters in an interview situation, with only the minimal amount dialogue conveying the maximum amount of information.  The primary character is Andy (a superlative James Duval) whose view of life is bleak to say the least: Andy doesn't believe in love, in commitment, believes he is bisexual even though he has never stepped out of his same-sex playing out, grows to depend on his friends, falls in love with a sweet talking fellow Ian (Alan Boyce) only to discover Ian is not at all monogamous, and finally feels the pain of heartbreak and makes a decision about life that ends the film.  The other characters include Michele (Susan Behshid) and Patricia (Jenee Gill) who are lesbian lovers and stable figures for the boys, desiring to have children and a wholesome life without the need for male penetration!; Steven (Gilbert Luna) and Deric (Lance May) who are coupled but come apart when Steven has an affair and Deric is gay-bashed; and Tommy (Roko Belic), the one who falls in love too easily with every one night stand he has.

The episodes deal with the characters' sexual attitudes, AIDS, life on the streets, drugs, parental alienation, loneliness, abuse, suicide, and the desperate need for extended family.  With Araki's technique we come to care strongly for each of these disparate kids: by the end of the film they feel like close personal friends of ours.

The filming technique is choppy and slips out of focus and seems to idle like a malfunctioning engine at times, but in Araki's sensitive hands these aspects add to the tension of the story.  Clearly Gregg Araki is a gifted artist, and his films subsequent to this successful one serve to prove his growth and increased power of heart to heart communication.  Highly recommended.
