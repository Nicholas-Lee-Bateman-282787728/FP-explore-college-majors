5426025,3,B00AIANIPQ,"The series is fantastic but once again I feel so ripped off by Amazon. The set of DVDs arrived in Australia and the first DVD will not play due to a massive crack across the disk from edge to center. Even after wasting money on becoming an Amazon Prime member due to all of the 'so called benefits', my only recourse is to pay for shipping from Australia back to the USA to get a replacement which may well have the same defect (it is so clearly a factory of origin fault). Its just not worth spending more money on postage so I will put up with not having half of season One. Australians do not get free return postage even though a product defect is a product defect anywhere in the world. Lift your game Amazon! As an overseas buyer do not get sucked into becoming an Amazon Prime member - only about 2% of the Prime video library have permission to be played back in Australia so I have given up trying to find something decent that I can watch here, Amazon now ships to multiple pick-up points in Melbourne but the cost is just a fraction less than having it delivered to my door. I basically wasted $90 joining Amazon Prime so venting my spleen at the absolute disregard for purchasers who live outside of the USA.

The Rocko series is however pretty good. Some terrific ideas and animation if a little juvenile in hindsight.",1516838400,,1331,4.366935483870968

5426069,5,B00AIANIPQ,"I love Rocko. A lot. As you can imagine with this? I jumped right on buying it. It does not disappoint with how many episodes you get- you get virtually everything a fan of the series could want.

The only thing to note is that you're getting the censored version.

""What?"" You say ""Censored Rocko?""

Yes, there are parts of Rocko that were censored later in it's life. For example, Heffer in the dairy farm getting hooked up to a milk machine is gone. While this wouldn't be a noticeable cut if they removed the scene altogether, you still see the BEGINNING of the scene where he's sleeping in the barn, and then it just cuts away a second after that!

It's uncensored on the VHS, but censored on TV/DVD. It's a minor issue overall of course, but worth mentioning.",1500940800,2,765,4.442857142857143

5426073,5,B00AIANIPQ,"For anyone that grew up in the 90's knows that cartoons today are nothing like they use to be. This box set allows me to have one of my favorite shows back in my life. The box its self is nice and has some cool art on the disks and inside the slip cover.

Rocko's Modern Life is such a good cartoon, its fun for kids and adults, in fact it wasn't until I watched it as an adult that I realized how many little  ""jokes"" were hidden in it.",1496793600,,437,3.8444444444444446

The DVD workmanship is mediocre at best. There's no brightness or saturation consistency, most of season one looks washed out, and much of season four is noticeably darker than the rest. ""Down the Hatch/Road Rash"" looks like the tape wasn't totally aligned when they transferred the episode and there's a discolored bar across the top of the screen for the duration of it. The sound mixing is all over the place too, about half of the episodes are several decibels below standard levels, some almost -6 db below.",1471564800,8,746,4.874015748031496

I still love it now just as much as I did back then! You can't beat the price at only $20 for 52 amazing episodes! What a steal! I remember back in the early 2000's when it cost at least $40 for one season for every show! So far the Discs play great with no issues! This show is a huge example how great 90's Nickelodeon really was & I was very lucky to experience it!,1468627200,,516,3.9711538461538463

The Good, the bad, and the wallaby (s01): the scene where Heffer gets milked by a machine and faints in ""delight""
Road Rash (s02): the scene where Rocko and Heffer unknowingly check out at an ""hot"" motel and rent a room, which the clerk thinks that their ""doing it"" until morning.

5426318,1,B00AIANIPQ,I see no point in censoring this show. Little kids aren't going to ask for Rocko's Modern Life on DVD as they have no idea what it is. Only adults will be buying this DVD and it should be the original episodes we watched as kids.

5426319,4,B00AIANIPQ,"I don't like how they took some of the adult humar out of the original episodes. Shout Factory and Nickolodian should be proud of their treasured classics which Rockos Modern Life is one of them and the rest of their classics like Ahh Real Monsters, Catdog and etc. They should remake this complete series and really take me back to the 90s as I remember them by definitely putting in all original episodes and original commercials if they can and better quality for all seasons and episodes. Nickolodian including Disney and etc in the 90s were really their Golden Age because what they have on tv now and days will never compare to these timeless classics.

This box set of the series is well worth the price especially now that I'm older and can understand more of the inside jokes that I didn't get back in the mid-90's as a youth.

5426334,4,B00AIANIPQ,"I love Rocko's Modern Life from my childhood. I've seen the whole episodes, but one that I can't remember was Leap Frogs. It was banned due to some sexual theme and adult theme. It was replaced with Wallaby on Wheels for future airing.

There are more sex jokes are:

Rocko doing sex phone operator

Rocko picking some berries and accidentally grabbed the bear's testicle and the bear runs away and grab his crotch

Rocko and Heffer went to the No Tell Motel

And Heffer uses the milking machine which it like a sex toy

Was those child friendly scene? Well, you know, for little children! And I don't hears some parents complaint about some sex innuendo. I hope Joe Murray won't male this TV-MA version since Ren and Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon. Hope I'll see some uncut version and show these to my younger cousins and they'll laugh, too.

There's not too many extras on the DVDs but I would check out the deleted scenes.  I was a bit apprehensive that these episodes wouldn't hold up to my rewatching as an adult, but they were still clever, bizarre and deeply funny.  In fact you could say they were Turdy Cool!

I have always quoted the fortune cookie that Filburt gets at the Chinese restaurant since I was a child, and I always will:  Bad luck and extreme misfortune with infest your pathetic soul for all eternity.  That right there should be enough to get someone watching the show.  Today's modern parallels would be something like Regular Show or Rick and Morty so if you enjoy either of those, give Rocko the ""dingo"" a chance.",1439856000,2,837,4.42483660130719

5426395,1,B00AIANIPQ,"As a teenager I adored the tasteful mix of mild adult humor and juvenile humor exemplified in Rocko's Modern Life. For this very reason I am disgusted at the censoring of various scenes such as the bear scene from episode 20 of season 2, the milking machine scene from episode 6 of season 2, and the no tell motel scene of episode 4 of season 2. I understand that Nickelodeon would like to portray their programs as child friendly in our overprotective society, but the least they could do is add these scenes into the bonus features. If Nickelodeon didn't censor their media then this would certainly be a 5 star product, but the censorship of mildly adult scenes is disappointing.",1423267200,29,682,4.644628099173554

5426412,5,B00AIANIPQ,"Merry Christmas Eve, mates! (Which is when I typed this review.) Rocko's Modern Life defined the funny and wacky side of the Nicktoons of the 1990's and onward, similarly to Ren and Stimpy, and was a precursor to SpongeBob himself, since some of Rocko's creators went on to work on SpongeBob, including his creator Steven Hillenburg who recently came back to work on SpongeBob full-time, Carlos Alazraqui who got his start voicing Rocko the wallaby and his faithful pup Spunky, and Earl the science lab dog, in the original pilot episode Trash-O-Madness (and still does in the whole series) who was the original voice of Scooter the surf-dude fish on SpongeBob, Doug/Mr. Lawrence who got his voice-acting start with Rocko as Filburt the phobic turtle, and went on to be Larry the Lobster & Sheldon J. Plankton on SpongeBob, and especially Tom Kenny (SpongeBob's actor since the beginning) who had lots of minor roles here and his biggest major role for Rocko was Heffer Wolfe, the wacky & bottomless-stomached steer! All 52 shows of Rocko, as prints seen on Nick/Nicktoons/TeenNick and not always uncut, in their respective 4 season sets are all in this 8-disc set, with exclusive cover art inside and out of the thick case by Rocko's creator Joe Murray (as the front covers of seasons 2 to 4 by themselves were drawn by him, too); thick as in the first 6 seasons of Digimon, as well as a few other complete series sets of classic Nickelodeon series, like The Angry Beavers, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters, both cases of Hey Arnold as a series set, Hey Dude, and a newer one Danny Phantom. Joe Murray had a big hit on his hands, and it became even bigger after the show ended by 1997, and bigger still with the DVD season sets and this very set! There's all sorts of wacky misadventures in this set, including several holiday episodes for Valentine's Day, April Fools' Day, Earth Day (Zanzibar), Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Founder's Day (the last one concluded the whole series, with the Thanksgiving episode as its partner!). Rocko had a brand of humor that appealed to kids and adults alike, but in crazier ways and/or more serious ways than SpongeBob, that got many Rocko episodes edited or banned from Nick for a long time. Unlike Shout Factory's other Nicktoon series DVD sets, this one contains bonus features in association with Joe Murray himself! Season 1 has none as season 2 contains online clips of Joe drawing Rocko, Heffer, Filburt, and Ed & Bev Bighead for his fans and the original version of Trash-O-Madness, where Rocko is yellow instead of brownish; season 3 has a half-hour program of Joe giving his own commentary on several episodes he remembers; and the last season has a 52-minute program from an actors' convention in October 2012 starring Joe, Tom, Doug, Carlos, and Charlie Adler who voiced the Bigheads AND the Fatheads, reenacting the first half of the popular episode Wacky Delly, hosted by another toon legend Rob Paulsen! The season 4 DVDs became a season set of their own just 8 months after the complete series set, right down to ""Wacky Delly Live 2012"". If you have kids watching that program, be wary of occasional bad words or mentioning Jesus' name, as if He were ""Pete"", if you know what I mean. If you haven't already got Rocko's season sets, or the whole enchilada in this set, go ahead and get the whole enchilada and save some dough and shelf space! As Rocko might put it, shopping day is a very dangerous day... especially if you have no idea what you're looking for. Edited or not, you won't be sorry with most bygone Nicktoons of the 1990's, including this one! Crickey, what a set!",1419379200,18,3633,4.759112519809825

5426432,4,B00AIANIPQ,"Packaging:
The packaging is great with original artwork by series creator Joe Murray. The case is clear and the size of two standard DVD cases (hate overly large or irregular series sets!) with large artwork on the inside showing through the case with practically every character that appeared on the show. My main gripe is no episode/bonus feature list on the packaging...you have to put the disc in to see. Also a duplicate of the front artwork appears on the back.

Video:
The video is not stellar, but it's watchable and certainly better than broadcast quality, but there is some blurriness, noise (especially with reds), and colors can seem washed out. Some episodes have a Nickelodeon logo in the intro which is inconsistent with the rest which seems odd because they could have just edited the intro from another episode.

Menus:
The menus are pretty basic, the main theme instrumental and character artwork with a text list of episodes and bonus features. It gets the job done. One gripe is if you directly select an episode, it will bring you back to the menu after that one episode plays, instead of going to the next. You have to hit ""Play All"" to watch them all.

Content:
This is the first and probably only time this show will be released on DVD which makes it a must buy. The show is a classic, and enjoyable for kids and adults allike. The DVDs themselves are the same exact discs from the individual season releases. Some people have mentioned that a few seconds here and there that were cut from broadcast decades ago are not present in this set. It would have been nice to have them, but I honestly don't think the scenes were so great that they detract by not being in this set.",1408147200,6,1698,4.597359735973598

If you were a fan of the show this is a great collection to have. It has all the seasons in one box therefore it is just one purchase.  Which was convenient for me.

The only negative I can say is that the case is extremely cheap and breaks very easily. When I opened my package one of the discs was floating around freely because its holder had broken. And to make matters worse the plastic in the center of the case that holds the 8 discs together was completely broken. But as I said before, the collection itself is great and if you grew up watching Rocko's Modern Life you'll love it. But the case is very cheap and does not hold 8 discs well at all.",1396483200,5,659,4.196850393700787

I've already watched the entire show as a kid, and am picking it up again just because of how much I like it.

There is PLENTY of adult humor in this collection, subtle enough to go over the heads of younger kids but blatant enough to be picked up by an adult.

Still funnier than any show the guys from it made afterwards (Camp Lazlo, Spongebob Squarepants).",1388534400,,285,4.72
5426466,5,B00AIANIPQ,Awesome set! All episodes in one case!! I remember watching these when they were first on on nickelodeon. This series was always a fun watch cause it really is funny.

5426478,4,B00AIANIPQ,"This was a popular show in the 90's and is still decent today, but the show itself did not age well.  Also, it is adult comedy for any of those who are not knowing.

Joe Murry is great on making this show and its great that most people from this show moved on to create another great show {spongebob!} but anyway, good high quality, special features are good, I'm watching all episodes in order and i'm on season 3.

5426492,5,B00AIANIPQ,The show is fantastic. It's just as good as you remember. It's silly fart humor is great and there is plenty of undetectable-by-youth adult humor in there so you can enjoy it together :) So definitely give it a try. The nostalgia is a 10 out of 10!

5426494,5,B00AIANIPQ,"This is one of my favorite cartoons from the 1990's. Yes, there are a few episodes that got some of their content edited out back then and the edited versions are on this set but I am still happy with the purchase.

What is really awesome is the last DVD's bonus material has the cast on stage from October 2012, doing a live reading of ""Wacky Deli"". It was so cool watching Carlos Alazraqui, Tom Kenny, Mr. Lawrence, & Charlie Adler do the voices of their respective characters. I wish I knew they were doing that last year. I would have loved to have been in the audience!

These are DVD's so don't expect Blu-ray quality or widescreen.

It's simple. If you like Rocko's Modern Life then buy this set! If you've never heard of Rocko's Modern Life, I highly recommend it especially if you've got a bit of a twisted sense of humor. Joe Murray put some interesting innuendos in some of the episodes.",1376092800,2,898,4.430303030303031

I have bought the greatest hits when they were first authorized by Amazon and subsequently I bought season 1 and 2 when they became available.  Finding this box set after the fact to complete the collection and it was a great price to boot!

The show is about Rocco and friends and some of the zany adventures they go on in their daily lives.  It's a similar setup to Sponge Bob in a lot of ways and you can tell that it kind of help pave the way for that show.  It had a mix of kids and racy humor that I didn't even realize was there until re-watching more recently as an adult.  It's still a very watchable cartoon if you liked it as a kid and I highly recommend this show even now!",1375056000,,783,4.019354838709678

I was buying the Seasons as they came out and got up to Season 3 before this Complete Set was put out and I bought this. It doesn't make much sense that they released the Complete Series before they released Season 4, but I had to have it.

Only con is the fact that the episode list is not included. You have to put in different discs to find the episode you're looking for and memorize which one it's on, a bit irritating, but it's still a fantastic show to own on DVD! Once I bought it, my friends all begged me to let them borrow it! A MUST have if you grew up during the 90's and want to relive all the great cartoons we had back then!",1373241600,,705,3.93006993006993

We used to watch Rocko for hours, every time it would come on. Really reminded me of my childhood, and what good times we had sitting around watching this after school. I bought it in a heart beat for her birthday.(Which is today! 06/03/2013.) Back in the day, this, Ren and Stimpy, And Rugrats were the only shows we needed to keep ourselves entertained. Never let your childhood memories die, buy this and get reminded of how awesome things were back in the 90's. Happy birthday, Mom. :D",1370217600,2,650,4.2926829268292686

5426522,3,B00AIANIPQ,"The moment I saw this set after I got off work one day in the electronics department I got very angry. I probably paid this (or maybe $5 more) on the first two seasons previously. The show easily is better than what Nick is crapping out these days, but the first two seasons didn't hold my interest as long as I thought they would. Actually, none of the old Nicktoons have.

The DVD's have scenes cut on some episodes though and they are not the same as they was first shown on TV the video is not the best quality I don't think the master tapes have aged well if they used them but it is better than Aged VHS tapes from the 90's way better.

5426533,5,B00AIANIPQ,"I was a 90's kid, and as such I was exposed to the best Nicktoons that were ever on the network. Long before the days of Spongebob, which was only funny for about 2, 3 seasons max, I was a child who grew up with Rugrats, Doug, Ren and Stimpy, and of course Rocko's Modern Life. Of all shows, my favorite was definitely the latter. I feel Rocko had the zany edge of Ren and Stimpy without being too overboard, and it had some real life parallels like Doug, without being boring in some stretches.

The entire series at $25 is beyond an amazing deal, especially considering the individual seasons are like $15 each (4 seasons total). Amazing price.",1366848000,,646,4.428571428571429

5426536,5,B00AIANIPQ,"Growing up, this was my favorite cartoon in the early days of Nick Toons. The characters were so wild and over the top, with interesting stories and humor galore. Then I grew up, found the original humor was still there, and also discovered all the incredibly perverted, obscene jokes I missed when I was little that were aimed at the adults in the room.

Lets be blunt...this show is twisted. And the humor can be completely unapologetic at times. (Don't worry too much; they didn't put the part where Heffer falls in love with the milking machine back in, or the full ""No Tell Motel"" bit either.) This show is not one you simply watch for nostalgia, but instead one you watch because the humor still holds up. There is a reason a large amount of people affiliated with this show have gone on to other things. (Cow and Chicken, Spongebob Squarepants, Camp Lazlo, etc)

I can honestly say this show isn't just one of my favorites from when I was young, but one of my favorites now. If you were ever a fan of this show, and don't mind some dirty humor, you simply can't beat the whole series for $30 bucks.

Do yourself a favor and order it already. Or sit around moping about fish sticks...your call.",1365638400,,1200,4.470319634703197

I grant you will live with the theme song for days after viewing these cartoons, but it is worth it to see just how well done the series was.

5426544,5,B00AIANIPQ,"I received this in the mail recently, and I must say that right off the bat, I was impressed. All 8 DVDs presented in a neat flip-out format. No clunky boxes to peels through, no mini-flyers/coupons falling out of the box, no stickers sealing the case shut, and no snap shut tabs on the side (why are those even necessary, are people too dense to close a DVD box? I'm looking at you, Disney.)

No, what you get is a very simple DVD box with all 8 DVDs. The reverse of the cover features original art done by Joe Murray, which is awesome.

The DVDs are even better. No annoying advertisements, just the episodes you paid for, and every single episode is included (even the pilot where Rocko's painted yellow is here!) Sadly, a couple of scenes were removed (the berry scene from Hut Sut Raw and the milking machine scene are gone entirely), but it doesn't take away from the quality of the episodes.

For an old school Nicktoon enthusiast like me, this was a blessing, and I hope Shout Factory continues to churn these collections out, -exactly- like this. I recommend this to anybody who loved the show, and to those who are just now getting into Nickelodeon, you should get this, too, 'kay?

Perfect score, don't regret buying this one bit.",1363910400,26,1241,4.526785714285714

5426548,4,B00AIANIPQ,"4 stars is for this DVD set. (The show gets five, of course.)

One star off because the quality of the first 3 seasons aren't great. Fine on an old CRT television, but not so great on a newer HDTV even with a quality player that upconverts. The good news is starting with the last episode of the third season (Zanzibar / Fatal Contraption) the quality is 10x better, almost perfect really. Like night and day. In Shout Factory's defense this may have had to do with the quality of the prints they were given and not because of their conversion.

Overall a great product, get it if you're a fan.",1363132800,2,594,4.342342342342342
5426549,5,B00AIANIPQ,"Rocko's Modern Life was by far one of my favorite cartoons as a kid. When I saw this not so little beauty hit the site, I took no hesitation in pre-ordering it. At first I was a little bummed to find out that Nick did not include the original cuts of some of the episodes but how they cut them out is practically seamless and does not detract from the shows quality. Sure some of the adult humor is omitted, but there is still plenty they left in. It still would have been nice of them to include the edits as a bonus feature or something but oh well. The amount of content you are getting, not including the bonus stuff, is well worth the price tag as the show's entertainment holds true to this day.

5426554,5,B00AIANIPQ,"Rocko's Modern Life The Complete Series
If your a fan of the show, this is what you've been waiting for!
Prior to this set Rocko's Modern Life was getting individual season dvd's, which is fine, but it's much easier and more cost efficient to buy it all in one nicely packaged box set and here it is!  One of the greatest Nicktoons of all time finally released in it's entirety with a few added bonuses as well.

Episodes:
All 52 episodes are present in order by air date spread across 8 discs, including the ""Leap Frogs"" episode where Bev Bighead tries to seduce Rocko.  This episode was eventually taken off air during the shows original run because of it's adult theme.

Packaging:
-The cover art was drawn by the creator of the show Joe Murray!
-The DVD case is the size of two standard DVD cases put together.
-The case is firm and solid plastic(not an eco-case, thankfully).
-The inside of the case features a beautifully drawn scene of all the characters in  front of Rocko's house.
-Overall a visually pleasing and high quality box set.

Bonus Features:
There are Four bonus features on this set.

-Behind the Characters with Joe Murray (Season 2 Disc 2)
This is a fun bonus feature, Joe Murray shows how to draw some of the main characters of the show and briefly explains the characters backgrounds and how they where created.
(This feature was previously released on the season 2 set)

-Trash-O-Madness pilot (Season 2 Disc 2)
This is the original 7 minute pilot episode that was never aired on television and produced in 1992.  Half of the episode was animated by Joe Murray and it features a very yellow Rocko.
(This feature was also previously released on the season 2 set)

-Selected Scene commentary (Season 3 Disc 2)
Joe Murray speaks directly to the camera about some of his favorite episodes and gives great insight on creating the episodes.
(This feature was previously released on the season 3 set)

-Live Wacky Delly 2012 (Season 4 Disc 2)
A live reading of the famous ""Wacky Delly"" episode with Joe Murray and the original voices of Rocko(Carlos Alzaraqui), Heffer(Tom Kenny), The Bigheads(Charles Adler), and Filburt(Mr. Lawrence) hosted by Rob Paulsen.  This is truly an amazing bonus feature, it's great to see the original cast together in the same room and that they can still voice their characters 20 years later!  After the reading the actors go into some detail about their experience working on the show.  This is the first time this feature has been on DVD, but if you bought the individual seasons 1-3 and are waiting for season 4 this will most likely be included, so don't worry.

Cuts:
There are three VERY brief cuts on this set due to censorship.  This is a minor complaint and should not influence your purchase.  The cuts are not the fault of the distributor(Shout Factory) and unfortunately Nickelodeon is to blame.  The cuts where made during the shows original run for being too risque and Nickelodeon only presented Shout with the censored versions of the episodes.

-The Good, The Bad, The Wallaby (S1E6)
A scene where Heffer appears to be pleasured by a milking machine is omitted.

-Road Rash (S2E4)
Rocko and Heffer visit a road side motel called the ""No-Tell Motel"" and ask the clerk for a room for the night.

-Hut Sut Raw (S2E7)
A very quick scene where Rocko is picking berries from a bush and a bear pops out of the bush and runs off whimpering and holding his groin.

Who knows whats next for Rocko, maybe a blu-ray release?  Maybe the show will get a reboot.  I guess only RRBM's nipples of the future can tell!",1361577600,44,3568,4.672
5426555,5,B00AIANIPQ,"Joe Murray wasn't expecting a complete series to come out in one package - and I don't think Shout Factory or Nickelodeon planned it. What Joe said on his blog was that the single seasons sold so well that Shout and Nickelodeon decided to produce a complete series DVD. It looks like all of the discs are the same as the previous releases. The inside cover has new original Joe Murray artwork that has a collage of multiple characters. Visit Shout Factory for an image of that.

One downside is there is no episode list within this set and the DVD extras are sprinkled through the set (they are found on the same DVD as the previous individual season releases). Also, the episodes are still censored (like the previous released Seasons).

Season 1 contains no extras
Season 2 has the original Pilot ""Trash-O-Madness"" with the original YELLOW version of Rocko and ""Behind the Characters"" with Joe Murray (info about the characters while Joe shows you how to draw them - Rocko, Heffer, Filburt, Ed and Bev)
Season 3 has an original selected scene commentary by Joe Murray - it's a separate video not audio over a certain episode; the video has Joe discussing certain clips from Season 3.
Season 4 has a 51 minute excerpt of ""Rocko Live"" (referred to as ""Wacky Delly"" Live 2012 on the DVD). This was a live event in California in October 2012 which included Carlos Alazraqui (Rocko), Tom Kenny (Heffer), Mr. Lawrence (Filburt), Charlie Alder (Ed and Bev Bighead) with Joe Murray (creator of the series and voiced Ralph Bighead) and hosted by Rob Paulsen. They did a live read of the first act of Wacky Delly and they also discussed working on the show.

Shout said that they weren't sure if the Season 4 separate release would contain the Live event - but I bet it will. The season 4 discs could stand alone. Joe created another original cover for Season 4. At this point there isn't an official release date for Season 4 but it is definitely going to be released.

5426556,5,B00AIANIPQ,"Joe Murray has confirmed on his blog that Season 4 will be out after this is released. I will update this review when a date has been announced. For those of you that already have seasons 1-3 and don't want to wait for Season 4 to come out, but don't want to pay extra for this, I'd suggest selling your copies and using the money to get this. If you use Amazon's trade in program, you might still have to pay a little more than what you would have paid for just Season 4 though. Still, $29.99 [the price at this moment in time] for something that should cost more is great.
