709383,1,6303854419,This is a poorly produced Scout presentation.  The storyline is very broken and difficult to follow.  I bought it on a recommendation and did not preview it before showing it to some Scouts on  a recent bus trip.  We watched one episode and did not see any more.,1374969600,,262,4.395833333333333
709384,4,6303854419,"Haven't had a chance to watch this one, but if it is as much fun as the other old movies we got at Christmas, we should enjoy it.",1358035200,,129,3.642857142857143
709385,5,6303854419,"I really am glad that I got it. It shows you where the B.S.A. came from and how strong it was. I wish the scout of today were more like this. Not so poltiticaly correct worry minded and yet stright honest and strong.

I recomend this movie, a little old but  so worth it. I am glad I got it.

709387,5,6303854419,"Remember when scouting was all about leadership training and giving boys a chance to prove their mettle? That's what this cliffhanger is about: Great things done by boys with courage and grit looking for adventure. A troop, they learn, is where a boy can prove his courage. A gang is where a boy goes to hide.

709388,5,6303854419,"This is one serial that has it all...lost treasure, lost Indian tribe, lost ghost town!!! Jackie Cooper leads his troop in defeating gangsters bent on securing untold-of wealth! Great chapter endings...over the falls, collasping suspension bridge, mangled by stampeding hordes, etc...Family frendly adventure romp & a fun serial to boot!
Sometimes the Universial serials get overlooked for being too plot-driven as opposed to the action-packed slick Republic product or the simplistic/cartoonish Columbia product...but, I will say that Scouts To The Rescue delivers on all cylinders!!!
Just enough plot...enough humor...enough thrills to keep fans coming back week after week.
A highly enjoyable viewing experience...Enjoy!!!",1195344000,7,725,6.048543689320389

WBZTV in Boston showed a 5pm movie every monday through Friday. The allotted time fram was one and a half hours. Sometimes the movie ended early and the remains time slot would be filled with a ""chapter"" of a serial. You never got to see the entire serial. I loved the cliff hanger endings. Today I am 68 years old and have a massive movie library. My movies are in every genre and range from 1936 to 2016. I have 75 serials and have just watched scouts.

Hats off to VCI for the restoration work on the serials. They are from a time gone by and are not only a very important part of American film history but more important, a piece of American culture and morality that has faded away.",1475798400,,859,4.36875
