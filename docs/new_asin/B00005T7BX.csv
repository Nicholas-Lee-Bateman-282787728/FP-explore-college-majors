7953578,1,B00005T7BX,"I remember one evening I went to Hastings Book and Entertainment I saw a DVD of USA's Dumbest Crooks and when I saw the price I couldn't believe my eyes and I instantly went and grabbed it, when I've gotten home I was dissapointed in it and I could've done without them repeating the same footage over and over and I also could've done without the quiz, plus it was nowhere near as long as the DVD claimed it to be, I'm thinking about selling it at a pawnshop and I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't sell well there, please don't waste your time on this excuse for a DVD",1161129600,2,572,4.162162162162162
