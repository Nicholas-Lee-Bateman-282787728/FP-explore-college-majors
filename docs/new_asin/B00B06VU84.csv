8560180,5,B00B06VU84,"As a watercolorist I've been challenged to learn how to paint wet-on-wet for a long time.  I do great with fine detailed wet on dry work, but wanted to improve and expand the my wet on wet skill set.  This video by Ross Barbera provided me with great insight on how to create beautiful wet-on-wet paintings without making a big amateurist mess on my paper.  His instructions for controlling the water and pigment is the best that I've found and I've been making great progress with his technique.  .",1530057600,,499,4.573033707865169
8560181,5,B00B06VU84,Very clear instruction. No nonsense and easy to follow even for a beginner. Have drawn and painted several lilies with the aid of the dvd.,1388448000,,138,4.56
8560182,5,B00B06VU84,"I like the fact that he doesn't leave anything out, but takes you step-by-step throughout the completed painting.  Not only do you learn how to paint this flower, but you can have fun while grasping valuable concepts of controlling, mingling, and floating watercolor onto the paper.  My cousin painted this flower, then got out one of her own photos and painted another beautiful rendition of her very own.  I haven't painted this one yet, but I did buy the video, and I've watched it.  I already painted the magnolia flower from his other video and LOVED it!  Looking forward to doing this one.  Sure hope he comes out with one on how to do ripples in water.  His paintings are magnificent!  Love the fact that he is willing to pass on this type of instruction to the rest of us.  He is an experienced instructor, and this comes through in his videos, which I highly recommend.",1374883200,,878,4.576923076923077
8560183,5,B00B06VU84,"At last I have found a teacher who teaches exactly the only way I seem to learn.  ""HANDS ON"", ""Show Me"" the most perfect step by step tutorial I have encountered.  I have always had a fascination with painting flowers.  But, I don't paint them  well.  They are very flat, too much paint and quite boring.  Professor Barbera knows how to teach the very ""artiste"" way to paint flowers.  They are delicate, filmy and  colorful.  Master Barbera  tells me through the video where and when to use the techniques that I have learned.  Now I know ""what"" to do ""when"".  Thank you Sir Ross.",1369440000,6,580,4.471153846153846
8560184,5,B00B06VU84,"I found the video very informative. I have not been doing watercolor for very long, and learned so much. Ross Barbera is a great teacher; takes the time to teach you how to do the small things that so many others just pass over. I hope to see more videos from him. He has much to teach those of us that have no formal training.  Laurie",1362873600,6,335,4.075757575757576
