5005783,1,B006ML50YC,"In the past year or so I have acquired a fair number of DVDs of Russian language movies in order to try to maintain a reasonable fluency in the language. Until now, I have been very impressed with the quality of these movies- the writing, acting and cinematography. Several were exceptionally good, with very realistic plots, exceptionally well written scripts, and superb, nuanced performances. So much for that streak of good fortune. In my humble opinion, ""Letter Never Sent"" is- on many levels- an abomination. It is as if the directing was done by someone who might be flirting with insanity, using many of the bizarre ""dramatic"" techniques associated with silent films of the early 1900s (including the use of highly inappropriate and annoyingly frantic/frenetic background music), the performances are often ridiculous (perhaps resulting from directorial malfeasance), the cinematography comes across as being somewhat amateurish (directorial responsibility), and with the dialogue being so muddled at times that I think even a native Russian would have a hard time understanding what is being said. BTW: full disclosure: I stopped watching this film at around it's midpoint. While the second half might turn out to be magnificent and greatly overcompensate for the faults of the first half, I am not at all tempted, as of now, to find out. I have never returned anything to amazon. This DVD might turn out to end that streak",1333324800,11,1432,5.150214592274678
5005784,5,B006ML50YC,"Those persons who were impressed with the recent escape film ""The Way Back"" should not miss this movie.  This Russian adventure film involves four geologists sent out to Siberia to search for diamond deposits. Then without warning, they are trapped by a giant, ferocious forest fire. The visuals are simply astonishing...who will survive and who will not? I never even imagined that a conflagration could be filmed like this. Are a thousand acres of trees in flame - how could that be?  The geologists (and the viewers too) experience the world coming to an end. The photography, the landscapes, and the final scene stick forever in my mind.

By the way, Criterion did an exceptional job on the transfer of this film to disk. The picture quality is outstanding.",1326499200,98,761,4.883720930232558
5005785,4,B006ML50YC,"Interesting is not a word I would use to describe this gorgeous, yet hollow film.  Granted, Kalatosov was working within a very strict regime when it came to film.  But his other films are much better in my opinion.  At least they have better stories.

This film is about four geologists searching for the 'diamond pipeline' in Siberia.  They end up trapped in a raging fire (which happens in the summer in Siberia) and struggle to survive.  The little piece of interesting story line revolves around Sergei's letter which, of course, isn't sent.  But this is brief and occurs in the early part of the film.  The second half is mainly a lot of very dramatic shots of the group trying to survive the inferno.

The one other interesting tidbit is the obvious Soviet endorsed propaganda.  The group is trying to discover these diamonds, not for personal gain, but for the glory of the Soviet Union.  In fact, we hear the congratulatory voice on the radio (which is only working one way) who continues to thank them for their efforts for the Soviet people and promises to send planes and helicopters and search parties.  I get the message guys, the Soviets will leave no comrade behind!

So a few little interesting tidbits here and there, but a very dramatic and striking background.  Worth the current $8.99 price to be sure.  Luckily my local library had a copy.  It's probably not a film I would re-watch.

Russian dialogue with English subtitles.  Includes a pretty short booklet insert with a brief essay and a few photos from the film.",1369440000,3,1538,4.696629213483146

5005787,5,B006ML50YC,"Astounding piece of work with some of the greatest cinematography of all time.

Terrific use of mirrors and reflectors.

A classic.",1359504000,2,131,5.190476190476191
5005788,4,B006ML50YC,"This Russian movie is considered a classic.  Done in black and white with English subtitles, it's set in Siberia and involves a hunt for diamonds.  The cinematography is impressive, the plot tense and the story definitely keeps your attention.  However, for me I found the story depressing.  Just about everybody dies and there's almost nothing to feel half-way good about.  Well done but not my type of movie.",1344902400,,410,4.970588235294118
5005789,4,B006ML50YC,"I found this film to be enjoyable from an aesthetic standpoint. The cinematography was done really well, as the back cover of the dvd states, featuring ""one daring shot after another."" That being said, the story was a bit weak. Not that there wasn't one, it was just told in a manner different from what most films use. It was more about character development and inner struggles than interpersonal drama.",1344729600,,405,4.8
5005790,3,B006ML50YC,"Stunning cinematography and art direction. Camera angles, lighting, everything breathtaking. The plot was rather thin, though, so I dropped it to three stars.  It didn't go very deep at all, but still a pleasure to watch.",1343692800,5,221,5.138888888888889
5005791,5,B006ML50YC,"First things first: The cinematography of ""Letter Never Sent"" isn't just ""good"" - it's quite simply some of the greatest cinematography of any film of the 1950s (which is saying a lot considering some of Hitchcock's films from the period, Kalatazov's other films, Bergman's films, ""Night of the Hunter,"" etc.), and possibly some of the best from any decade.  That may sound like hyperbole, but just watch a few minutes of the film and see what I mean. And it's much more than just the relatively common ""pretty shots of pretty places"" style of cinematography that receives so much acclaim from certain circles - here, the camerawork demonstrates a mastery of all the elements of cinematography (movement and form, shadow and light, and so on.)

It's also one of those cases where the form and style of the film perfectly match the content - the incredible cinematography never seems gratuitous or showy, because all the elements of filmmaking reflect and enhance the narrative.  Those who have studied anything about cinematography will be awestruck by some of the shots, and by the creativity and intelligence of cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky.

On the other hand, the film's story of four geologists trapped in the Siberian wilderness isn't particularly innovative - in fact, it's just a basic tale of man vs. nature.  The filmmakers strip the narrative down to the bare essentials, and give us only the minimum amount of characterization (in keeping with the Soviet principal that helping the motherland is of greater importance than any single individual) to keep us interested in their plight.

However, what story there is is very well told, and all the performers do a good job.

This is a film for those of us who can get a thrill from great, innovative filmmaking.  It brings us to new places, and it does so in an extremely stylish fashion.  With that said, although the visuals are the main draw of the film, this isn't a case of ""style over substance.""  I, personally, found myself very involved in the plight of the characters - but I can understand those who desire a little more detail from their narratives.",1340409600,4,2125,4.894150417827298
5005792,1,B006ML50YC,"You may like this film, if:  you love it when the main character's most defining aspect consists of having a beard; you like preposterous Man vs. Nature storylines that are unrealistically weighted toward the man (having been written by a man of course); you love stories that show the strength, fortitude, and ingenuity of the Soviet People; you like scenes when someone goes lost and the others wander around calling their name for 4 minutes; you're so enamoured of the director's other film, The Cranes Are Flying that you are willing to overlook the obvious flaws of this one; you think that good cinematography alone can constitute a good film. Otherwise this is a total wash. I would give it 2 stars but someone has to counteract the over-enthusiastic 5 star reviews. Letter Never Sent?-- more like The Blu-ray I Wish I Hadn't Bought.",1340236800,4,840,4.833333333333333
5005793,4,B006ML50YC,"Visually astonishing!  It's the words that I can easily describe the 1960 film ""Neotpravlennoye pismo"" (Letter Never Sent) directed by Soviet filmmaker Mikhail Kalatozov.

Known for directing the 1957 film ""The Cranes are Flying"" and the 1964 film ""I Am Cuba"", ""Letter Never Sent"" would reunite the filmmaker with ""Cranes"" actress Tatyama Samjlova who had become of the most talented and sought out actress of the time in Europe.

And while ""Letter Never Sent"" is not as popular or as critically favored as Kalatozov's other two films, the film is best remembered for its surreal and visually stunning cinematography by Sergei Urusevsky.

VIDEO:

""Letter Never Sent"" is presented in black and white (1080p High Definition).  I have to admit while watching this film, I was floored by how gorgeous this picture looks considering it was made back in 1959.  There were no blemishes, the detail was strong, no blurring, no problems whatsoever.  I have to go and say that the picture quality is fantastic as close ups show skin pores and grime on the characters faces, contrast levels are wonderful as whites and greys are well-defined, black levels are deep.  I was very impressed!

According to the Criterion Collection, this new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a new 35 mm print.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' DVNR was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Letter Never Sent"" is presented in LPCM Monaural Russian with English subtitles.  The dialogue and the music by Nikolai Kryukov is crystal clear and hear no hiss or any audio problems during my viewing.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical soundtrack positive.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Letter Never Sent - The Criterion Collection #601' on Blu-ray comes with no special features.

EXTRAS:

""Letter Never Sent - The Criterion Collection #601' comes with a 20-page booklet with the essay ""Refining Fire"" by Dina Iordanova, professor of film studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

JUDGMENT CALL:

You often hear about collaborations between a director and their cinematographer and how closely in sync they are in working together on many films.  From Jean-Luc Godard and Raoul Coutard to Wong Kar Wai and Christopher Doyle, these collaborations have often led to the efficacy of a film.

And the same can be said with director Mikhail Kalatozov and cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky.  These two men work brilliantly together and although they have worked on three films, the three films ""The Cranes Are Flying"" (1957), ""Letter Never Sent"" (1959) and ""I Am Cuba"" (1964) are films that the three are best known for.

With ""Letter Never Sent"", it was not as highly regarded by film critics when compared to their masterpiece ""The Cranes are Flying"" but just watching this film, it's hard to deny it because it is visually stunning.

It's important to note that when it came to Russian cinema, most people were familiar with films by Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, Vsevolod Pudovkin but by 1957 with ""The Cranes are Flying"" winning the P'alme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the film resonated strongly with cineaste all over the planet and more and more people became interested in Russian cinema.

Also, the fact that both Kalatozov and Urusevsky didn't create traditional Russian films, they did things their own way and these films created by the two men were part of the ""thawing"" of Society society.

Josephone Woll wrote in her book ""Cranes Are Flying"", ""Within weeks of Stalin's demise, writers openly rebuffed bureaucratic interference in the arts and defend their right to the individual expression.  But in the rigid hierarchy of the Soviet Union, such a radical change of direction required an official imprimatur"".

And this artistic expression by both men would have an influence on filmmakers Andrei Tarkobsky and Francis Ford Coppola (and his film ""Apocalypse Now"").  While Kalatozov's Stalinist ideology of the time is quite evident.

First, a discussion of the visual aspect of this film.  The film looked amazing, haunting and also incredibly risky.

From the occasional close-ups to capture emotional reactions, the vignette shots of the characters or branches to the quick camera shots as characters can be running, while the camera follows each and every step was fascinating and beautiful. Also, to add the clever editing of N. Anikina of fire consuming the video while the geologists are digging for diamonds to Sabinine thinking of his dear Vera.  For this type of film, you can say it has quite a few moments of romantic situations, some utilizing clever editing which was pretty significant at that time.

You can see the characters being surrounded by trees and branches on fire, embers falling by the many all around them.  The characters having to dive underwater so they do not come in contact with the branches.  In today's films, these scenes would all be in CGI, but back then, to achieve realism, the talent were put into risky situations.

I wouldn't be surprised if the fear that we see in the faces of the characters was genuine fear.  While I'm sure the fire was controlled, having falling embers on fire all around you, suffice to say, it's risky filmmaking that fortunately no talent were seriously injured.

But overall, the cinematography is just amazing to look at.

As for the ideology, that portion of the film also intrigued me as everyone was excited about the expedition in the name of the Soviet government and wanting to initiate synergy into the industrial revolution by finding these diamonds.  Although this film is about four geologist, it is more of a film about four people trying to attain something incredible for their government.  The characters talk about pride for their country.

Sure diamonds came from South Africa, but why would Russians want to do that.  It's the refusal of capitalism that you see in this film, these individuals are working together for the betterment of Russian society and its government is right.

In fact, these individuals are not interested in taking diamonds back home with them or pocketing it for their own individual desires.  There was none of that.  These people wanted one thing and that was to accomplish a dream of the Soviet people celebrating the riches of what they found and jump starting their country's economy and industrial progress.

As for the Blu-ray release, this film looks absolutely magnificent in HD.  It looks as if the original print was not even touched because the detail and the quality of the film looks fantastic!  The lossless monaural track is crystal clear when it comes to dialogue, Nikolai Kryukov's evocative score was amazing and English subtitles were easy to read.  No problems with video or audio at all.  If anything, Criterion Collection has done a remarkable job in making this film look nearly pristine!

If there was one thing that I wished this Blu-ray release had, it would be special features as ""Letter Never Sent"" comes with none (which is usually never the case for a release from The Criterion Collection). Although, you do get a Criterion Collection 20-page booklet.  Also, it's important to note that because of the lack of special features, The Criterion Collection usually releases these films at a lower price point for Blu-ray and DVD.

Overall, ""Letter Never Sent"" is a straightforward, easy to follow film.  In fact, I would say this is one of Kalatozov's most accessible film out on video.

While the storyline may not be as memorable compared to Mikhail Kalatozov's ""The Cranes are Falling"" or even ""I Am Cuba"", ""Letter Never Sent"" is a visual masterpiece that should not be ignored.  Especially when Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography looks incredible on Blu-ray!  Definitely recommended!",1336176000,11,8142,5.0843373493975905
5005794,3,B006ML50YC,"It is nice to see Letter Never Sent given the deluxe treatment, but this is not one of Kalatosov's better works.  Sure, it is stylish with many intriguing cinematic techniques employed, especially as a fire sweeps across the Siberian taiga, in which these four Soviet geologists find themselves in pursuit of diamond veins for the state government.  It struck me as a purely ideologically driven film, as opposed to his masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cranes-are-Flying-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0000633SD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cranes are Flying (The Criterion Collection)</a>, which captured the humanity of Soviet citizens as WWII closed in around them.

There is plenty of tension with the geological team forced to flee a raging forest fire after several weeks of mineral exploration, but it is hard to feel much empathy as it seems Kalatosov and Urusevsky were more interested in visual effects.  I suppose this is partly due to the censorship at the time.  The map becomes paramount in this film, not the characters. There are much better films to be had by this great Soviet filmmaker.",1335484800,24,1164,5.823529411764706
