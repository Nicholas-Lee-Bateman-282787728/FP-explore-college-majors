8447978,3,B004Y73020,not much to say. It's a nostalgic look at a  gay club-had some interest-but not a lot.,1404432000,,86,4.0588235294117645
8447979,5,B004Y73020,"The Twelve was a remarkable gay bar in Boston at a time when people of all stripes came together and had FUN.
This video gives a nice history of the club as well as interviews with club regulars who relate how the club fit into and changed their lives. There is obviously a lot of affection in the handling of the subject. I really enjoyed watching this documentary.",1353715200,,366,4.397058823529412
8447980,3,B004Y73020,"I was very excited to run across this documentary on Amazon.  I spent a good amount of time at the Twelve in the late seventies and early eighties.  It was, quite simply, the best nightclub ever.  The focus of the film leans towards the early eighties, while, in my opinion, the Twelve was at its zenith in the late seventies.  Nonetheless. I'm glad to see that someone spent the time and effort to permit some of us briefly relive one of the most enjoyable periods of our lives.  I'm hoping for a sequel with a few more pictures and videos, a broader range of interviewees, and a soundtrack of the greatest dance music ever.",1338336000,2,625,4.447368421052632
8447981,5,B004Y73020,"What a great film that captures a special time and place in Boston history. It makes me wish the Twelve was still operating as a disco. The club may be a thing of the past, but this film keeps it alive.",1305763200,,202,3.951219512195122
