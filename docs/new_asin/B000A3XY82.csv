2356655,5,B000A3XY82,"This is a fun, motivating workout.  It's not overly challenging, but it will get your heart rate up and you'll even sweat a little.  Sure, I've done harder workouts than this, but this is at least fun.  The instructor is motivating without being too fake or cheesy.  She's cool and instructs well.  She breaks down the moves slowly and then soon you go up to tempo.  I thought it was really unique to see the other dancers all in street clothes.  One is in jeans (something you just couldn't do because of lack of movement in them), but other than this, it's a funky great routine that you can do many many times without getting sick of it.  You can even learn some moves that could be done in a club.",1128470400,87,701,4.297709923664122
2356656,5,B000A3XY82,Marie Forleo makes it fun and easy to workout. The great thing is it doesn't feel like a workout while I'm doing the dvd. But after doing her workout I feel great and know I've had a great cardio workout and maybe even become a better dancer. I really recommend this one. It's the kind of dvd workout that I feel like doing over and over - and each time it feels new and enlivening. I can't say enough about this one! It's great!,1127260800,11,429,4.119047619047619

2356669,2,B000A3XY82,"I bought a Crunch DVD a few years ago and didn't really like it. This is my 2nd attempt at Crunch. What I do like is that there are some moves that are unique (you know how every exercise dvd has the same moves???), and the routines are short and fast, and easy to pick up. The problems are that the routines are short and fast and I never get winded or even that sweaty. You learn three steps, do the routine through a few times repeating each step twice. Then do the routine 4 times through and only doing the steps once. So, once you get going, you really only get 3 minutes of faster-paced movement. The steps are fun, so sometimes I put this dvd on after I complete a more strenuous workout routine. ALSO!! The outfits are SUPER distracting. There is one woman in jeans, and looking like she just stumbled into the class. Another woman is in a binkini top and baggy bottoms, as if she's going to the beach, but the most annoying outfit is the camoflauge pants of one woman, with one pant leg ripped off. No, not one short pant leg and one long pant leg, but a pant leg ripped, jagged, and hanging down. It's just bizarre, distracting, and really stupid. The other ladies look great in fun, colorful outfits. Can't we all just do that? :) Oh, also what I don't like about this (and the other crunch dvd I have) is that it seems like someone off camera tells them ""Okay, everyone hoot NOW!"" because they'll all WOOHOO at once, and at weird times, not just like the end of the routine. It feels so forced. OOOH! One more thing... there is a point where the bikini-topped woman rolls her eyes in exaggeration because we are about to do the workout 4 times through...as if she can't believe what this task-master is asking from her! It's so absurd because she is obviously being under-worked. I wish you could see the pants.....",1394582400,,1828,4.363636363636363
2356670,1,B000A3XY82,"This is not a workout and the moves are too easy and boring.  I love fitness vidoes and this is the first one I actually threw away.  The cardio is equivalent to tapping your toes from side to side and moving your arms around a little.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the cool down and the workout sections.  I'm not in terrific shape and I didn't even break a sweat with this.  And it wasn't fun because I felt like the moves were little more than marching in place.  I gave it one star because it would be good for someone brand new to fitness or someone trying to become active again after a surgery, bed rest or that sort of situation.",1393200000,2,656,4.25

I struggled with it, and had to rewind often to try and get a couple of dance steps right.  On the plus side though, the music is good, the host isn't too cheesy or annoying, and it's a pretty fun concept to dance your calories off rather than run!

2356673,1,B000A3XY82,"First, my dvd was produced with video slightly off sequence from audio.  I purchased it off a Walmart cheapo pile so not  much money lost.
I won't be replaying it.
The electronic music was completely uninspired and uninspiring.  I want my dance workout to have great tunes.
The instructor, Marie Forleo, was unappealing and her cohorts were a distraction...one girl looked like she escaped from the Betty Ford Clinic before they could rehab her.
Generally, instructors are walking a fine line between being ridiculously enthusiastic and making weird sounds.  Marie has her ""choo choo"" arms and ""sunshine hips"", which made me gag.
Overall, the tempo of the two aerobic dances was a little too fast and the movements kind of clunky.",1379116800,,730,5.008264462809917

Because I liked her in this video, I bought a couple of others of hers.  They aren't as good-still fun, but not as good and they have some of the same moves.  I'd stick with this one. I generally love the Crunch series.  They have it down.",1346803200,,401,3.9625

2356698,5,B000A3XY82,"As some people have already mentioned, this does tend to be a light-ish workout. But for me, that fact just makes it more adjustable to my energy level on a given day.

Every other day, I do a Billy Blanks Tae-Bo cardio routine. I do the Crunch Cardio Dance Blast (or another light workout DVD) on the days in between. I also usually follow up the cardio (on Billy Blanks days and on Crunch days) with some kind of pilates DVD: I love Lara Hudson's 10-minute pilates workouts -- usually do three or four 10-minute segments.

But back to Crunch Cardio Dance blast ... a few of my likes about this routine:

* Marie Forleo -- It's interesting to me that reviewers have pretty unanimously said she's ""not cheesy."" Some of her obviously canned lines are *very* cheesy -- and yet, and yet, miraculously, they really don't come off that way. Marie just exudes sweet, sunny, vibrant energy. Her lines may be a trifle fake, but her joie de vivre is real. :)  If I'm feeling a bit down, just watching her tends to pick me up.

* Lots of range-of-motion exercise for upper body -- As someone who once suffered from ""frozen shoulder syndrome,"" I get frustrated with many cardio workouts that give the upper body only very limited motions. This routine will give you all kinds of glenohumeral, scapulo-thoracic action!

* Adjustability -- If, on a given day, I find my energy is pretty high and I want to do more, I can ramp up the cardio by subbing in dynamic stretches (especially for hamstrings) or belly dance moves (or jogging in place) for the marching-in-place intervals. Plus, once you know the choreography (which you probably will after using the DVD a couple of times), you won't need to do the ""half-time"" learning sequences. Just do the regular pace while Marie is doing half-time. OTOH ... if, on a given day, I'm semi-low energy but want to do *some* kind of movement/exercise, I'll do the routine exactly as it is -- with all the marching in place between dances and the ""half-time"" learning tempo for the first run-through of each dance move.",1328486400,2,2047,4.6098901098901095
2356699,5,B000A3XY82,I bought this for my mom.  It came quickly and she liked it.  Now I need that 'insanity' work out thing.,1322697600,,104,3.9047619047619047
2356700,5,B000A3XY82,"I was skeptical about this one...in my experience, workout DVDs that feature any sort of hip-hop dance are typically cheesy and corny. This one was actually very fun, and keeps you moving the entire time, ensuring you work up a nice sweat. The instructor is fun, bubbly (but not too much so), and great at cuing. If you dread cardio, want something to mix up your workout routine, or simply like dancing, this DVD is worth a try.",1313193600,,429,4.512820512820513
2356701,5,B000A3XY82,"I hate the gym, I get bored plus Im recovering from a broken ankle. I've tried working out again but nothing has kept me motivated, until now.

2356702,2,B000A3XY82,"This video was not for me. I like really fast paced workouts. This felt slow to me, too much rolling of the hips and flinging of the arms to really get going on your feet. The instructor annoyed me as well, and I couldn't focus.",1304812800,2,228,4.088888888888889
2356703,5,B000A3XY82,"I've got a large library of exercise DVD's, some of them boring, others okay, and a few that are just plain fun.  This one falls in the latter category...it makes you want to move, with simple instruction, but also dance moves that are more than the simple basics you sometimes get.  She breaks it down, then speeds it up, then puts together 3 different moves, and you repeat it twice a few times, and then one of each for another few times until you really get it.  It's a good length as well, about 40 minutes.
Highly recommend it.",1302048000,,533,4.363636363636363
2356704,3,B000A3XY82,"This workout tries to be very dancey and as a result, I've spent more time trying to master silly things like hip rolls than actually exercising.  I spent most of the time trying to figure out what moves to make than feeling like I was mastering the workout.  Sure, I was sweating, but overall, it was more humiliating than feeling like I was doing a good workout.",1292025600,,364,4.417910447761194
2356705,5,B000A3XY82,I read the reviews for this product and they helped. I have had workout vidoes in the past that have just sat and collected dust. This workout DVD is fun and I actually sweat so I know I am also working out.,1268956800,,207,3.9523809523809526
2356706,3,B000A3XY82,"Pretty good, definitely worked my hips/thighs. Takes a little while to get the steps, but not bad. Each segment is a different dance, but each dance is done the same.  You learn a step, add a step, do them together, then run through the whole thing, then double time, then each step individually again for all the dances. I like that some of the girls in this video aren't already in tip top shape so it makes me think I can do it too. I don't think I'll be doing the whole video through again, definitely will have to do it in segments to break up the monotony.",1268006400,2,562,4.203703703703703
2356717,4,B000A3XY82,"This DVD says that you'll ""dance like a diva, get fast and funky, and do a little island swing,"" but really it is all hip-hop dance with a little of something else mixed in.  The sections are:

Warm Up-A quick little dance routine with a lot of plies, and some stretching for the legs and neck.

Island Jam 1-This is the most fun of all the routines, I think, but it is hip-hop with quite a bit of island dance mixed in.  The dances are easy, but the arms are big which makes it cardio.
Island Jam 2-I didn't find this as fun as the first one or as island like.  The moves are really all hip-hop here, but they are still good cardio builders, although there is one step Marie (the instructor) breaks down a move really slowly which causes my heart rate to plummet, but I just fast forward.

Fast and Funky 1-This section I expected to get hip-hop dance, and that is what I got.  Unfortunately, Marie breaks down ALL the moves in this routine to teach them slowly, so I miss half of the routine fast forwarding, but it is a fun section, still.
Fast and Funky 2-This routine is probably the sassiest of them all.  All of the moves have an attitude to them, and it is my least favorite.  Not because of the sass, but just because I didn't really like the moves.

Diva Dance 1-This dance routine is mostly Latin, and the first few moves are Cha-Cha and Samba, but soon after that Marie tosses Latin away and just goes back to hip-hop moves.  I still liked this section.
Diva Dance 2-This one seemed a bit Broadway with (surprise, surprise!) hip-hop mixed in.  This was a really fun combo, though.

Cool Down-The cool-down stays with some Broadway slower moves, and Marie does a few stretch combos, but she should have done much more.  She stretches your neck, back, and shoulders and that's it.  It does not stretch your legs at all.

This is a great DVD, and I love hip-hop dance I just wish some of the sections would have been more what they say.  To the men, though, you might want to skip this DVD because there are no male backups, although the moves aren't too feminine.  A great DVD with a bad cool down.",1261094400,5,2108,4.320610687022901
2356718,3,B000A3XY82,"There are a variety of reviews for this workout, some love it, some don't.  I rate this okay at best.

I found the dance combinations to be fun, I liked the Island Jam the best.  I really liked the instructor, Marie Forleo.  I liked her demeanor, not to mention she is an awesome dancer herself, she made the moves look easy.  I was able to pick up most of it but not all.  For an experienced dancer like Marie and her backgrounders, these steps don't require much effort.

I was annoyed with the ridiculous attire and over the top mugging by some of the backgrounders, who of course are front and center.  I totally understand having a good time for the camera, but some of the facial expressions were a bit much.  But that's just my opinion.

I prefer Marie's other workouts to this, Prevention's Dance Yourself Thin and Dance off The Inches Tummy Tone Party Zone.  They are more up my alley, this was quite hip in the dance and the speak, not my cup of tea.

Not all bad though, I still give it three stars.  The dance moves are fun and the music suits the workout well, got me up and moving, even though I wasn't totally sold on this.",1259193600,2,1138,4.286384976525822
2356719,5,B000A3XY82,"I love Marie Forleo! I have her other DVDs and this one may be the best. The choreography is fairly complex which means that it takes awhile to get, even longer to master -- which all means that you won't get bored. Forleo's a great instructor. The music is upbeat, fun and the moves give you a great workout. If you like cardio dance ad Latin music, you'll like this video! One small negative: the other folks in the class are a random bunch and I was sometimes distracted by their horrible outfits.",1254528000,,500,4.387096774193548
2356720,5,B000A3XY82,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  Marie is pleasant and upbeat, with typical uber-excited instructor behavior.  The dance moves are easy to pick up and you will be sweating in no time.  If you're an experienced dancer, this would probably be too simple, but for a lapsed one like me it was great. I think the music is good and the moves are fun enough to keep me going through the whole thing.  Like most dance aerobics, Marie uses the ""building block"" method- during each routine, you'll keeping adding and adding moves until you have maybe 10 steps.  It will take a little time to get them all down pat, but even though I couldn't keep up right away, after about two or three times I had most of them.  The biggest downside is the annoying blond- they keep the camera on her way too much and she just needs to calm down.  But other than that... I like this workout.",1248652800,2,861,4.34375
2356721,5,B000A3XY82,"I will start out by saying that if you wanted to see an elephant dancing in a china shop, you should invite me.  I'm a TERRIBLE dancer - very unimaginative, and uncoordinated... and too reserved.  But I love to move my body, and getting on the machines at the gym isn't always convenient, or fun.  I will also let you know that I am PLUS sized, and while I'm working on fixing that, I'm currently working out with a good amount of weight on my body.

Enter Maria Forleo, little miss gorgeous abs extraordinaire.  I feel that her instructions are:
a) easy to follow
b) fun
c) a little silly and cheesy (which makes me smile in the middle of my workout, whether it's for the right reason or not)
d) motivating

Also?  There's this curly-haired blonde girl standing to Maria's left (our right) who makes the WEIRDEST facial expressions when the camera hits her.  Someone told her this was comedy opera theatre or something.  GREAT overacting.  That right there always makes me laugh when I'm working out.  Just watch for her, you'll see what I mean.

Did I do the moves right the first (5) time(s) I watched it?  Probably not.  But I still got a good workout just from trying.  And now, after owning the video for a few years, I have them memorized.  It's not my workout method every DAY, but I do incorporated it one to two times a week to keep things mixed up.  So can you do it too?  Yeah, it just requires practice.

The moves are, pointedly, a little dated and silly.  I think it's hilarious that anyone would user these moves in public, as the dvd case recommends.  Maybe if it was 1993.  However...

... maybe it's because I'm a bigger person, but these dance moves have me DRIPPING sweat by the end of the video.  And although some people have complained that it's too short, for me, 35-40 minutes is my cardio goal.  I am a young mom, and I just don't have time or energy for anything more than that.

So:
YES I would recommend it,
YES I enjoy it, and,
YES it works for me.",1248307200,5,1979,4.33879781420765

I do recommend this DVD!",1246838400,,288,3.9655172413793105
2356723,5,B000A3XY82,"If you're looking for a low impact, fun work out that you want to keep coming back to, Cardio Dance Blast is it! I would say this is geared toward women no older than 30 as the moves taught in the video can seamlessly be brought into a club or be done by boy band back-up dancers ;) Anyone older may feel kind of silly. Was it the hardest work out I've ever done? Absolutely not, but I did sweat a little and could feel it in my core muscles (especially if you add in extra hip action). Its a great one to do on days between more strenuous work outs or on a day when you are having trouble pulling yourself out of bed. The instructor was motivating without being annoying and she walks you through the choreography at a good pace. Overall, I highly recommend it to someone who enjoys dance-based works out or for fitness beginners.",1246838400,3,831,4.232704402515723
2356724,5,B000A3XY82,"I love this DVD! The choreography is fun and not overly challenging. The instructor breaks difficult moves down in half time and gives you many chances to master it.

Marie is so cute! She's really motivating and fun to learn from. The entire group of dancers has an upbeat vibe that you can't help but feel. The length of the workout is adequate, but it seems to fly by in no time! Give this one a try, you won't regret it.",1246233600,,424,4.234567901234568
2356725,4,B000A3XY82,"At first, this workout seems pretty cheesy -- the moves are a little silly, and Marie Forleo likes to give themed encouragements along the lines of, ""You're on the island, mon!""

Still, it's very well-structured, and it's perhaps that same cheesyness that makes it fun to work along with. Aside from an effective warm-up and cool-down, there are six dance segments. Each one starts with a simple move, builds on that with more moves, until you have a mini-choreography. You then do each move in the entire choreography twice, and finally, the whole choreo with only one rep of each move. Forleo always introduces the basic footwork, then adds stylizations like twists or hip bumps, then arm work, and finally chest or head stylizations. This is makes it easy to pick up the moves, and you can work at your level.

The variety of dancers/exercisers in the background is really nice. Some are more into the dancing, some have less athletic bodies, some do smaller or imperfect versions of the moves.

I tend to find cardio boring, but Cardio Dance Blast is a great way to stay mentally as well as physically engaged throughout a workout.",1246147200,,1135,4.780612244897959

2356737,4,B000A3XY82,"This workout is fun!  It's not very challenging, but if you want a fun workout that's easy to get through, this is it. Marie is an excellent instructor and easy to follow.  I used this DVD to get me back into working out, and it worked!",1239321600,,236,4.108695652173913
2356738,4,B000A3XY82,"O.K. I am sort of a beginner but only in that I have not done these type of video workouts in 4-5 years. I do have some experience, just not recently. And I do have a background in dance.
Breakdown: As a somewhat beginner, I find the pace quite fast. I can follow but I can see where someone without a background in dance would be lost. The moves are really not broken down well, especially after the Island Girl segment.
On the other hand, if I were in better shape and worked out regularly (as I did in the past), I would probably find this video too simple and not challenging enough.
So, the bottom line is that I recommend this video to those with some experience but perhaps needing to ease into exercise videos again. Maybe an intermediate level.
I like the instructor. Marie Forleo is motivating and enthusiastic without being too over the top. And she cues really well. I like her style and method.
The background dancers....ummmm...the one with the wild hairdo makes a lot of odd facial expressions and is quite distracting. Maybe that's why the camera operator was so enamoured as to keep going back to her face while I really needed to watch foot and body placement. The dancer with the odd ripped pants was good but her outfit was distracting. And what was that thing she had on her arm?
Overall, I give this video four stars. I would give it five stars with more breaking down of the moves. I still highly recommend this for those of intermediate experience.",1235692800,,1472,4.496268656716418

Once you get the dance steps down you can get the movement going better.  I am not a 'dancer' so for me the dance moves are a challenge to follow.  The up side is the 20 mins goes real fast, you have a bit of fun with it, but I find I get a better cardio workout with traditional exercises lunges, squats, jumps etc..  This dvd is ok if you are bored with your current exercise routine and want to mix things up a little, but definitely not a dvd I would use as my primary resource to be (or get) fit. I would consider this a light cardio workout. Probably better for beginners.",1231632000,,690,4.0

2356741,3,B000A3XY82,"Hailing from Crunch fitness, a big name in the gym circuit, I was expecting a little more from this video. It wasn't terrible, but I felt it wasn't as good a workout as it should have been.

It was about a half hour video and was not broken down into different chapters. But the dances were quick enough so if you didn't like them, you moved on. The instructor was kind of funny trying to be all hip & funky. Rather than specific dance types, they mixed together a lot of different types of ""modern"" moves to give the ""Island Jam"" feel or the ""Dance Diva"" feel. But I felt like I was doing a mix of 90's era dances and stuff from my jazz dance class I used to take.

When it was finished, although I was hot, I didn't really feel like I got a workout. The dances were very quick and were mostly just to get you moving but not where you would feel the effects on your muscles the next day.

It probably would be good for someone who is just starting out dancing because the instructor does a decent job of breaking down the steps and starting slowly and then working up to a faster tempo. For me however, I'll be trying something else.",1228694400,,1134,4.168949771689498

This is geared towards a younger age group though. Many of the crunch videos seem to be.  All in all, it was a really fun video and I will be adding it into my rotation.",1202342400,,529,3.81651376146789

2356765,4,B000A3XY82,"This workout is approx. 36 minutes long with warmup and cooldown.  It is lead by Marie Forleo, who is quite personable.  I thought her cueing was quite good, especially considering how much choreography there was in this workout...jam packed!

However, I cringed just a smidge at the fake Jamacian accent during the Island Jam intros, as well as her repeated use of the word ""sexy"" in one of the segments.  I'd like to think that the script ideas were Crunch's and not Marie's!

There's a few twisting moves in this workout that make it tough to do on carpet, but I was able to modify without taking any from the workout.  There's also some impact, also easily modifiable to low.

I appreciated the stretches during the cooldown but would have preferred it if the stretching part was not so fast and choreographed...just basic stretching would have been fine by me.  And I would have liked to see some Leg stretches.

The music matched the choreography quite well and was above average in quality for a dance workout.

Recommend to intermediates that have some dance workout experience...I have tons of dance workouts and was only able to p/u about 1/2 of the moves on the 1st try.  I like dance workouts that I have to work up to, so Cardio Dance Blast is a keeper for me.",1198281600,,1273,4.588495575221239

But I continued and moved on, after a while that stuff didn't bother me and I really started to enjoy myself. Now my baby  brother excersices with me (he can't get the exact moves down either) but he still enjoys himself while working out.

The DVD is more dance oriented. ALOT of the moves are very old skool hiphop (early & mid 90's). For this reason, I believe this dvd is best for us females especially those in their mid 20's to early 30's who still remember first learning these moves growing-up.

THE MAIN POINT IS: YOU'LL LOOSE THE WEIGHT. AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS!
(p.s. Their outfits can be a bit distracting, one of the dancers is wearing ripped-up pants(literally hanging from the waist)making her look a bit shippwrecked. And a very cheesy bubbly bouncy dancer that the camera keeps focusing on contributes to the added level of difficulty in picking up the footwork.)
But,Overall you'll be entertained during your workout!",1186444800,3,1036,4.776536312849162
2356768,1,B000A3XY82,"This dance dvd is just so annoying on so many levels, I  don't know where to start. But I'll compare it to other dance fitness DVDs I have and hope it helps you make a decision.

I've got Marie Forleo's Prevention Dance Yourself Thin  - she's really great in that  - explains the steps  clearly and is pleasant and encouraging.  My only criticism of that DVD is that it is a tad slow and  you spend a lot of time marching rather than repeating the steps over and over - you have to do it yourself to work up a sweat.  But she's very pleasant and doesn't shout at you in this one.  There are maybe 4 backup dancers who aren't distracting but help you follow the steps.

So I bought the Crunch Cardio Dance Blast thinking, based on other reviews, that it would be a great workout and as I liked Marie, was looking forward to it.  But I find with this one, she's totally different - she shouts ""that was awesome"" just so many times ,she tells you to ""crack it, uh-huh"" ( whatever that means!), she squeals quite a bit, she rushes through the steps  (yes, you can rewind and replay but still, it's annoying) and the steps are just not much fun. I  couldn't believe it was Marie because she is just so different.  Also, there are about 7-8 backup dancers who look like they're at a party (one looks like she is high on illicit substance) , they are distracting and it just makes the screen look so busy.  They hoot and holler too, and are not that helpful if you can't follow the steps.

It's like this Crunch DVD is aimed at a slightly younger audience -( I'm in my thirties) with all the ""attitude"", the squeals, shouting and ""whoo-hoos"". I wouldn't mind so much if the dance steps themselves were effective, but they're not very interesting and I've barely gone through the complete routine. After becoming familiar with the steps,  maybe  I've  done it twice in a month ...  and even then I need to turn the sound down so I don't hear all the squeals.

If you're new to fitness dance DVDs, like I was, and don't know which to get or who is good, then I suggest the Crunch Fat Burning Dance Party and 10 Minute Solutions dvds with Jennifer Galardi.  She is a much better instructor - the moves are fun and entertaining and she is not at all annoying, kinda cute the way she encourages you with the steps. While others have said her steps are hard to follow, it's just a matter of watching, rewinding, doing it in slow motion until you have it.  I've never  done any dance before in my life and  have picked up the steps easily enough.  You do work out a sweat with those ones.

So this one just makes my blood pressure rise and it's no surprise that I do not recommend it.  Marie's other - the Prevention one, is good for beginners, but not terribly vigorous , whereas the Jennifer Galardi dvds are fantastic.",1186358400,15,2807,4.315487571701721

Marie is a good instructor and not overly cheerful like some others (although she does say things like ""stick your booty out!""). I like the steps, but they are way too easy and she spends too much time explaining some of them at half-time. There is also way to much marching in between, which is another reason you don't get as much of a workout. Although sometimes the marching is more of a workout than the dance steps.

Even though it isn't really a workout, I still do it occasionally on light days or as a warm-up to another dvd. I wish Marie would put out another dvd that was more advanced -- I would buy it for sure.",1184630400,2,792,4.076923076923077

This is a great dance workout.  I do it at 5:00AM, and I don't ever dread getting up because it's fun!  To really get my heart rate up, I use ankle weights throughout.  That makes this workout more fun and challenging.

Island Groove and Fast & Funky are the best.  Island Groove really gets your upper body moving.  Right away, you are engaging your entire body.  Diva Dance is not very challenging and just not as fun-- especially part 2.  I usually skip it and do the other sections over.

The instructor is really good.  She breaks down the steps before she makes you do them.  The only thing I've noticed is that sometimes the camera is panning or is on close-up so you can't see the footwork.  After a few times through though, you'll be dancing along in no time.

But it's like she does it for a second. I'm still trying to figure out the steps and moves and the next thing I know, they're gyrating and twisting 10x faster.  I don't understand why they couldn't build up a little slower.  On the plus side, it did make me sweat and got my heartrate up.  Well, I won't give up.  I guess I just have to practice, after all that's what real dancers do anyway, LOTS of practice.  Plus, maybe I am just so used to doing my cardio workout.(Crunch Cardio sculpt - I recommend it!) I found myself doing steps from Cardio sculpt instead of the dance steps that I was trying to do!

I will stick with it and do my best.",1156982400,5,976,4.0785340314136125
2356841,5,B000A3XY82,"I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.

The instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image.

I teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves.

And, you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march.  Enjoy!",1156809600,4,335,4.26984126984127
2356842,4,B000A3XY82,"I bought this DVD about a month ago and have been using it 3-5 times a week since. After 2 children and years of not working out or eating right, I was finally ready to get back into the swing of things. But, being 50 lbs overweight, I needed something that would be challenging, but not send me looking for an oxygen mask either. This DVD definitely fits the bill.

The instructor does a great job of breaking down each move so that you can get the hang of it. For some of the more challenging moves, they bring it down to ""half time"" so it's easier to pick up, before bringing it back up to tempo. Still, it took me at least 3-4 times of working out to this video before I felt like I had a good handle on things.

This video is so much fun that I actually look forward to waking up 45 minutes earlier every morning to do it. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am NOT a morning person, so that should tell you a lot. I would probably be embarrassed if anyone ever watched me doing it, but on my own, I can let loose and have fun with the moves.

I'm currently trying to find another Crunch cardio workout similar to this to mix things up a bit, and wish they would come out with a ""sequel"" to this one!!",1155686400,10,1211,4.016597510373444

2356845,1,B000A3XY82,"Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves.

To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the ""cheesiness"" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.

I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun!",1152921600,12,1089,4.844086021505376

If you don't have that ""funky edge"" you might find yourself kicking your husband/significant other out of the room - some of the moves made me feel just plain silly!

It's quick (about 30 minutes) but you really sweat while doing the dance moves.  It does take a while to get the dance moves down but once you relax and really get into it; it becomes second nature.  After a 3 week break from intense workouts, I returned to this one to get back in shape and to get back to a little bit of cardio.  I had forgotten how much fun it is to do.  Combine this with your favorite strength workout and you've got a really fun routine or just do it alone for your cardio portion.

I took dance for 3 years and I think it moves at a good pace and the moves are simple enough for a beginner yet fun enough for a bit more experienced dancer. I wouldn't want to do this workout if my main goal was to shed pounds, I enjoy doing it when my goal is to have fun as well as lose weight. I think the choreography is well done- but I was hoping for something a bit more complex (a beginner might feel differently).

2356864,5,B000A3XY82,"The paper I read (Argus Leader) ran an article  where they had fitness experts review DVDs in various categories and whether they were ""Worth The Workout"".  This DVD was highly rated across all categories .

-Works the Legs & Butt

- it was not boring

-a beginner could do it but experts would not get bored

-that the instructor would get you motivated (albeit in a cheesy way)

- the expert  would use the DVD again, (with a caveat  about people with knee issues may have problems with the side to side movements..)

Anyway I picked up all four DVDs (there were recommendations in the general category of Cardio, Toning, Pilates and Yoga) and so far am extremely  happy with all of the titles they recommended. (In fact I have some of the titles that they stated were very poor titles, and they were right there also.)

I found that the dance steps were a little advanced. I had a difficult time following even the slower pace, and then must of look ridiculous trying to do these steps up to tempo. The instructor had good energy which thankfully made me want to contine and actually put this DVD in again and learn it. I think if you're either a dancer or very coordinated and can pick up steps in no time this workouts for you. But if you've never danced I'd be a little hesitant unless you are willing to learn and not give up on it. Once you learn the moves i think it would be a really fun workout to break those rutts of exercise we all get in.",1144886400,9,760,4.100671140939597
2356866,2,B000A3XY82,"Well, I figured this would be a good buy, since I'm a total couch potato and just wanted something to get me started on the right path.  Well...

I did indeed work up a sweat in the first few minutes (I'm a couch potato, remember?) There is LOTS of movement.  I have rhythm, so following the dance moves wasn't as hard for me as others found it.  But here is where the kudos stop and the critiques begin.

Biggest problem?  This is like watching an MTV Dance Video! This a group of girls -- one in jeans, for crying out loud -- who look like the high school senior class getting together to practice a routine for the pep rally.

Looking to learn proper breathing? Look elsewhere.  Need to improve your form?  Yeah, right.  This workout (if it qualifies as a workout) does not fit the bill if you are looking for a solid technical workout, intro-level or otherwise.  And if you're a beginner, I don't think I'd recommend this either.  I felt myself worrying if I was properly gyrating my hips instead of whether my knee was extended past my toe.

I guess this workout is for young girls (12-18) who want to workout but think other videos are ""lame""...the dancing would probably appeal to them more.

I like the clothes on the dancers and the set design has beautiful, punchy colors.  It has a decent warm-up and cool-down, too.  It's a bit funkier than the old Jane Fonda workout videos but I do think Jane would approve.  FUN!

1. no loud annoying instructors that sometime say stupid things.

2. the breakdowns are somewhat useful to learn the routine.

3. quite fun if you haven't done much with hip hop/ jazz-ish dance, actually even if you did have some background with dance you might like it too.

4. actually works out a bit of a sweat.

5. allows to add personal spice.

6. the music is OK, not too impressive, but not considered boring.

7. quite coordinated

cons:

1. the camera focuses on a couple of girls, worse thing is that the came focuses on the top part of the body so you miss the dance moves.

difficulty:

complete novice: the dance moves could be quite hard even with the break down. but if you have good coordination it's quite fine. i'd say it could take up to 5-7 practices to get it down

little experience: dance movies can take up to 3 or more replays to get down.

expert: no problem with dance moves.

personally:

because i was determined the get the moves down, i wasn't annoyed at the fact that the moves could be hard. it may take some time for people who are not coordinated to learn the dance, but i felt that when i finally got it down i felt proud of myself.

of all the dvd workouts i have done, kickboxing, ballet, pilates, yoga, i'd say that dance is the most fun, because you can add in your moves whenever you feel like it. this is the only dvd i've used more than 20 times so far.",1142726400,4,1404,4.261363636363637

The back up dancers are the worst part of the routine though, especially the blonde in a bikini top and the one in the cut off Army fatigues.

I like the fact that it is broken up into different segments with different dance themes lasting about 10 minutes each. I think most people will definitely see that there is a learning curve for keeping up with some of the moves. However, it is not so difficult that the average person (or in my case overweight and out of shape, with two left feet) can't get a lot out of the video right away. I disagree with what one of the reviewers said about the dance moves being so difficult that you might hurt yourself. I mean, just use common sense! Do it at your own pace, and before long you will amaze yourself with what you can do - and have fun doing it.

For anyone who feels a little lost at first, hang in there. Picking up moves without having them broken down slowly can be intimidating at first, but the thing I like about it is that it keeps you moving and it forces you to get outside of your head and just go for it- and eventually you get it, and you feel amazing! I was so bad at hip hop when I started out, but I stuck with it and not only do I feel better about myself, but I can actually dance without looking like a complete fool. . . and if I was brave enough to give it a try in a class full of people, you can definitely do it in your living room!

She can also move like the wind, as is her crew (all of average weigh and age). The earlier moves are difficult to keep up with. I was able, however, to keep up with the Samba segment and those thereafter. Maybe, it's because these are steps I have done repeatedly in other videos/DVDs. Overall, the instructor should bear in mind that not all viewers are in their early 2o's and/or are veterans in the world of ""working -out.""  Personally, I guess I was able to relate and coordinate my body movement to the Latin portion of the DVD; whereas the Hip-Hop was more challenging and not as easily paced.

And the wild-haired blond on the right (as you view the video) was too much the main focus, and watching her certainly didn't help if you wanted to learn the steps.

I have several Crunch DVD's, and as someone who is just getting back into exercise, I bought this on a whim (I am a sucker for any workout with ""dance"" in the title) and figured it would sit on a shelf for awhile until I was in slightly better shape.

Then I screened it, I thought- ""Wow- I bet I can do this!""

I did initially have some trouble following the instructor, but I am willing to bet that by the third run-through, most of the moves will be second nature to me. It was a fun workout that didn't make me feel like a complete moron.  I stuck with it the whole way through, had a fantastic time, and I felt invigorated afterwards.

I especially enjoyed the fact that there were different-sized women among the dancers, and that they weren't singled out ie: ""This is Veronica, she's our token chunky girl, and she's doing the low impact version for you wusses out there."" This democratic approach is unusual in my experience with workout DVD's.

My personal weirdness:The fake Caribbean accent? Argh! I see that becoming very annoying with repetition- luckily, it's not through the whole DVD. Also, that chick in the front? With the shredded camouflage pants? The only word I can think of is, ""WHY?!""

For those of you who are hardcore dancers and exercisers- this would probably be too easy for you guys, so you might want to use it for an ""easy"" day or just steer clear.

2356910,2,B000A3XY82,"I'm an overweight 48 year old female & I found this dvd hard to follow.  She didn't stick with one movement long enough for me to catch on to the steps.  Maybe as I continue to use the dvd I'll get the step before she moves on to another but at this point, I'd rather put in a different dvd which I can actually work out with.  I would not purchase this product again, nor will I try any of her other dvd's.",1137196800,2,407,3.8795180722891565
2356917,5,B000A3XY82,"I agree with all the other reviewers who said it was fun & the instructor was motivating & not annoying.
The whole thing is set on a stage with 7 backup girls in various shapes, etc. The only menu options is to play or chapter selections & it is in 2 speaker stereo. It's 38 min long with a min or two warm up & cool down consisting of mostly all dance moves w.
The moves were all easy, but not boring, all from the ""island jam"" style or ""latin"" like salsa & cha-chas & ""diva"" which is more club style.
They almost never stop moving between learning & doing dances except for a split second while you march to ask you if you're ready for more.
All moves are broken down to the simplist analogy such as small squats, then adding the legs, then the arms to it's final look.
This is low-impact, beginner workout in my opinion, fun, might work up a sweat, but you don't need a lot of room or expect any jumps & should not be exausting.
In the past, I didn't like some of Crunches's DVDs because they seemed hurried or stiff, but this one was more relaxed/fun, which I am happy to say.

2356918,5,B000A3XY82,"This was my new years resolution tape. i just got it today and took it for a test ride while the baby was asleep and i must say...it was quite fun. at first i was hesitant and ready to hear the cheezy and ridiculous ""inspirational"" words that typical WO video instructors do but i was surprized to discover that she (Marie Forleo) was surprizingly pleasant and funny.

The only thing would be that it is a short work out (39 mins). so i don't expect to be loosing the baby weight dramatically. But for now while i can't hit the gym or pretty much get back into shape whip fast i can have fun with this tape and the dance routine errr... work out. worth your money if you like to dance!",1136505600,3,685,4.1893939393939394
2356919,4,B000A3XY82,"I had a hard time finding a workout video but finally decided on this one because of the words ""cardio"" and ""dance"" which sounded like a good combination.

The dances themselves are actually fun to do, although there is very little description of the moves before hand and it took me a while to get them figured out (usually around the time they were moving on to a new dance) but the changing of the dance themes really makes the time fly by. The music was fun but stayed pleasantly in the background. (I hate being overwhelmed by overpowering soundtracks)

I didn't feel the usual awkwardness about trying these moves out, it felt more like a night with the girls than a workout. My heart rate elevated pretty quickly but the marching in place helped keep me from getting overwhelmed too quickly. I like this enough to seek out the Fat Burning Dance Party to add to my collection.",1136419200,,882,4.540880503144654
2356920,5,B000A3XY82,"This 37-minute workout is so much fun.  It has a warm-up, then two ""Island Jam"" dance segments, featuring Caribbean-inspired moves; this is followed by two ""Fast and Funky"" sections with hip-hop type dance moves.  Next, there are two ""Diva Dance"" segments, that are Latin-flavored, then a cool-down.

The music is great, and the dancers are high-energy, which I find inspiring.  Many of the moves are done at half-speed first, and then brought up to tempo, making them easier to learn.  The instructor is perky without being annoying, and some of her funny remarks actually made me laugh out loud!

I really enjoy this workout, and recommend it most highly.",1133740800,13,657,4.981651376146789
2356921,4,B000A3XY82,"This tape is definitely a lot of fun, and the instructor is not overly bouncy and cheerful which I love.  The moves are definitely funky and club-worthy.

It is a little tough to follow the first time around. I watched it first, practiced the moves and then did the workout and still couldn't fully keep up.  So, it will take some time before you can really follow it.  You might consider rewinding the half time break down instruction a couple times before going full tempo.  They switch around from a full body view to just the arms during the instruction, so sometimes if you haven't quite gotten the footwork down, you don't get much of a second chance, and then you have to catch on to the arms as well! It will take practice practice practice!

The best part is that there is girls of various sizes in the video. It helps keep you from feeling too depressed when looking at the super skinny instructor!  And you know if the big, medium and small size girls can all do this workout, you can too!

If you are really not coordinated yet with workout videos, I do HIGHLY recommend Fat Burning For Dummies.  Really easy to follow and the instructor continuosly give you left and right cues.  She's a little overly perky, but it's a great introduction to workouts and it is very dance-like in nature. Having done this one helped me with some of the moves in the Cardio Dance Blast.  I was familar already with the grapevine, toe taps, march ups etc already from the dummies tape.",1133395200,11,1479,4.481343283582089

Marie Forleo encourages you to just enjoy yourself (something I definitely did)!",1131235200,5,288,4.254545454545455
2356924,5,B000A3XY82,"Great workout, with a refreshing and energetic instructor. What's so neat - and unusual - about this DVD is that it's a real person teaching, rather than a robot. And Marie is not going through the motions with a fake grin on her face, she is actually having fun. She invites you to do your best, rather than showing off her skills as unattainable goals. And that inspires and gives me the space to have fun too, and to feel good about myself, rather than being concerned about doing it right. I highly recommend this DVD to anybody who wants to truly enjoy a workout!",1130976000,6,568,4.419047619047619
2356925,1,B000A3XY82,"Despite the instructor's professional appearance, the workout appears dangerous! If you blink, you might miss the warmup. This is followed by complex, frustrating routines for which no guidance is given to personal safety (i.e. injury prevention). I consider myself an intermediate-advanced level fitness participant. Yet I couldn't adequately follow the routines. Worse, I was concerned I'd be out-of-comission for alternative workouts after trying to complete some of the moves. Find yourself something less challenging/frustrating to follow that's a lot safer!

I have had this video for several years.  I mostly used it on days when I just needed a light workout or didn't feel like doing much.  I am a former college athlete and have stayed in pretty decent shape in the 10 years since college.  BUT--I had a baby 9 weeks ago and was shocked at how weak my body became (in spite of working out during pregnancy)...a few weeks ago, I popped this in while my baby was napping and WOW--it was such a great workout.  I could feel it working every muscle and yet it wasn't too exhausting to do.  It's fun and a quick workout that is very effective--but if you are in super good shape, it probably won't feel like much.  Also, I do remember that some of the moves were a bit challenging/fast for me when I first got this (I have two left feet)--but it's easy to pick up after a few tries and the main point is, as long as you're moving--you're exercising, even if you don't dance the moves 'perfectly'.  Looking forward to getting back in shape with this!  BTW--for all you moms, my baby loves watching me do this and she'll wiggle and giggle while I do it (sometimes I do have to stop in the middle to feed or diaper but that's motherhood for ya).",1416009600,,1238,4.32034632034632
