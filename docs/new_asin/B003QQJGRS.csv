8402501,4,B003QQJGRS,"Yes,the title, jacket blurb and what marketing there is, suggest this might be something like a soft-porn/action film.  It's not.

It was produced with assistance from the Canadian and the Ontario film production tax credit.  Either it went straight-to-DVD, or at least never appeared in US theatres, so it does not have an MPAA rating.  There is no nudity (even partial) of significance--the scenes at the dance-nightclub are not more revealing than what you'd see on a beach in the summertime.  The violence is not extreme and the language, although there is some vulgarity, is certainly not as bad as the language in some other ""R"" rated movies.

The jacket & other reviews already tell you it involves an ""exotic dancer"", Cassie (played by Sarah Allen) who through circumstance ends up with a large amount of methamphetamine and cash from a drug deal gone very bad, which she wasn't really involved in.  From there, the plot explores what she does or tries to do with the money (and drugs), how it affects her circle of friends & co-workers, and the efforts of the drug-boss to get his drugs and money back at any cost (the hit-man pursuing her is well-played as a cold-blooded killer, undeterred by any problems of conscience or morality).

I can't say too much about the plot without BLOWING the plot--but to draw a comparison to another grade-B film from a different genre (and throw it a little plug at the same time) you might compare this film to the movie ""Doom"" (based on the now-old computer game) or other similar films, in which the main character kind of shifts unexpectedly or at the least, where you thought the film would probably be going shifts.  So there WAS a bit of serious thought behind this low-budget production, which otherwise does not stand out in any particular way.  My theory about the title is it has a double meaning (doh!) and what is really ""stripped naked"" here is not bodies, but characters.

This is not a great action-film; there's no great special-effects nor fancy camera-work; the acting is not Oscar material, but it did manage to hold my interest throughout the story and I found myself remembering it better than maybe half the films I see.  If you watch it without great expectations, you may find it worth the view (even without nudity).",1289692800,5,2287,4.762025316455696
8402502,1,B003QQJGRS,"Very misleading cover art, if you are expecting a grindhouse B-Movie sexploitation film... I was. The cover is made to look like a 60's drive-in poster, (must have got the idea from a recent release called ""Teenage Hitchhikers"" which DID deliver a classic sexploitation film. BUT if you pay attention to the text, ""Cassie's Done Stripping..."", well her stripper days were BEFORE they made this film, even in her sex scenes she remains fully clothed. And at the strip club,the strippers never appear in less than fully covered lingerie. Except for maybe 5 seconds, from a distance, and edited so tight you better not blink. Other than that, its a fair attempt at the consequences of finding drugs and money that are not yours. The only exploitation is in misleading the buyers.",1289606400,4,776,4.886363636363637
8402503,3,B003QQJGRS,"The only thing that keeps me from giving it less than 3 stars is that at least it moves along.  It's kind of low budget and the main star has an amateurish feel.  She's a femme fatale (with a capital B), but I'd swear I can see her wanting to crack a smile in self-consciousness during some of the scenes.  And some of the scenes are pretty laughable, so I don't blame her too much.  Her recurring fantasy of sipping champagne with a 'Frenchman' in Paris - the guy sounds like an American trying to do a French accent - is somewhat representative of the quality of the movie.  The bar owner's wife and the lesbian girlfriend were better than average (for this movie), but overall it almost felt like a TV production.  On the other hand, while the plot develops ridiculously quick and is over-convenient to the point of being contrived, it's easy to watch and certainly doesn't take much paying attention to to get into. Kind of like The Equirer.  I wouldn't recommend it, but I have seen worse.",1287446400,,994,4.458563535911602
8402504,5,B003QQJGRS,"Fun, entertaining flick about a stripper who comes across a drug deal gone wrong, steals a bunch of drugs and money and then tries to flee the country but has to wait three days to get her passport. During those three days, she has to contend with her lesbian roommate, greedy ex-boyfriend, and the bad guys who want the money back.",1287360000,,332,4.459016393442623
