6602740,5,B00MW07JJG,The Don Matteo series are great.  There is always a moral to the stories.  The whole family can watch and enjoy.,1425254400,,112,4.285714285714286
6602741,5,B00MW07JJG,"Just a wonderful series! The stories in this set are a little more intense the previous years, but there is still enough light-hearted humor to keep the stories in concert with the previous years. I would suggest starting this series from the beginning, as you will encounter the principle characters in the proper order, but even beginning with set 7 will provide 12 episodes of enjoyment. Very appropriate for families and anyone else who wishes wholesome entertainment without gratuitous violence and sex.",1424736000,4,508,5.2073170731707314

 mini vacation.",1441152000,3,219,4.341463414634147
8674957,5,B00MW07JJG,"I own all sets of this series and it's the best ever. Perfect it you want to brush up on your Italian, but there are English subtitles so even if the language doesn't appeal to you, you will still enjoy this show. The characters are very believable; they start to feel like people you know. The acting is outstanding. Good humor. Good story lines.",1440201600,3,347,4.4375
