8195388,5,B00005NX1V,"The character Chidori appears in this tape and adds more drama to the show. But she also gives out a lot of comedy as she openly expresses a crush for Yuuhi who thinks she's only 12 or 13(she's really 16). Meanwhile, Aki is being taken over slowly by an alter ego that is literally making him go mad. By the end of the tape, Tooya gets in a bloody battle with Mikage guards to escape with Aki. Will Tooya survive in time to meet Aya? Will Aki escape and take control of himself? Just have to buy the tape to find out! :D",1013385600,,520,4.058252427184466
8195389,4,B00005NX1V,"I've actually written a full review of this plus anime and manga differences on my site.
Having read the manga and having watched the series, I can say that this one is a good shoujo series no less done by Yuu Watase herself.  However, this is no Fushigi Yuugi.  Although there is a lot of magical and Japanese legend here (the subject of which is the Tennyo), FY is in itself a mixture of 4 legends of miko, 4 Gods, seishi, etc.  This one only has the stories of various Tennyo concentrating on the main character Aya's alter-ego, Ceres.
As is with everything shoujo, romance and relationships is very very much emphasized, if not too overrated.  I was sick of Miaka and Tamahome later on the FY series.  Aya and Tooya is too much.",1006214400,,732,4.432835820895522
