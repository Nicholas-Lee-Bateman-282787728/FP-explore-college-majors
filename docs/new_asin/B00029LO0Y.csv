2072291,5,B00029LO0Y,"""Home on the Range"" is the last Disney traditionally animated film due to the increasing demand for computer animation. This film has a lot of heart, and the story hits close to home. Maggie(Roseanne Barr) is a prize winning show cow. When the other cows on her farm where stolen by Alameda Slim, her owner had to sell the farm and give Maggie away to Pearl at Patch of Heaven. The farm appears to be just what it's name suggests, but Pearl has fallen into trouble with the bank, and the farm will be auctioned off if she can't get the money she needs. When the cows hear about the bounty put on caddle rustler Alameda Slim, they set out on a wild west adventure to capture him and collect the reward money to save the farm. However, there are other people after Slim, so it becomes a hilarious race. The film is rated PG, but there really wasn't anything too bad. The reason for the PG rating is burping and slaptick violence. The violence is exactly like what you would see in a Looney Tunes cartoon. That big long lump even appears on peoples heads. I don't think parents will have a problem with the content of this film.
The style of animation is very good. The scenery is so pretty, and the animals are so cute. The voice work is amazing. Dame Judy Dench provides the voice to lead cow on Patch of Heaven, Mrs. Calloway. I wouldn't have pegged Dench to play a western cow, seeing as she is british, but it really does work well, giving her the feeling that she thinks she is better than everybody else. Jenifer Tilly is the voice of my favorite cow in the film, Grace. Grace is a little slow and very peaceful. She provides most of the comic releif during the film. Randy Quaid is the voice of the yodelling outlaw, Alameda Slim. He really is perfect at it, creating the second funnyist Disney villain, just next to Yzma from ""The Emporor's New Groove.""
""Home on the Range"" is the type of Disney film that will please everybody. It has a great story, as well as good humor, and a lot of heart.",1081555200,40,1999,4.347593582887701
2072292,2,B00029LO0Y,"Disney's last hand-drawn feature isn't a Disney film at all; it's an attempt to make an extended Warner Brothers Looney Tunes feature, which is as sad an end to Disney's legacy as I can think of.  To abandon all that made the studio great and try to ape another's seccess is a sure sign that management has lost faith in it's legacy.
Things start off well enough when a decidedly unlucky rabbit continually gets into ever more hilarious situations (getting run over by a wagon wheel, stuck by a cactus, bitten by a snake, you get the idea).  It was the one moment in the film where the audience as a whole was laughing.  But after this sequence, I only heard sporadic chuckles.
Although the fast pace and simplistic story accurately mimic the Looney Tunes shorts, the characters aren't nearly as entertaining.  None have the charisma of Bugs, Daffy or even Pepe Le Pew.  Without strong characters the comedy comes off hollow and didn't hold my (nor it seemed the audiences) interest.  Although the film is a brisk 71 minutes or so, I found myself checking my watch and someone sitting next to me fell asleep.
There seems to be a general lack of imagination in this film.  The one exception being the completely unexpected way in which the cows are being stolen from their farms.  It's an inspired idea that had the potential to be a classic animated moment in Disney's cannon, but as it stands it feels roped in, constipated, as if the filmmakers were afraid to trust the idea and let it guide the action.
Young children will mostly enjoy this film but its sure to be forgotten soon after the curtain comes down.  There are a few jokes that are  meant for older audiences, but it's not enough to make a lasting impression.  This film will be best enjoyed on DVD as a babysitter.",1081382400,6,1778,4.559748427672956
2072293,5,B00029LO0Y,"My kids and I loved it - great songs & singers (including
Bonnie Raitt), wonderful traditional animation (a great break
from computer-generated everything), well-paced, and a great
(nearly) all-woman cast (I usually don't like Roseanne Barr, but
as the voice of the heroine cow she is terrific!).  I'm sure we'll
see it again at the theatre and then wear the DVD out!",1080950400,3,367,4.919354838709677
2072294,5,B00029LO0Y,"Walt would be proud of this animated movie. It is great fun for the entire family. It reminded me of some of Disney's older movies and that's a good thing. Some of the humor is a little ""adult"" but I feel this did not hurt it. The music score is just great, one of the best in a while from the Disney animated films. The choice of actors' voices was perfect. I really had a good time at this one. I loved it.",1080950400,,408,3.927710843373494
2072295,3,B00029LO0Y,"It's the end the trail! After nearly eighty years of loyal traditionally animated service, the Walt Disney Company has decided to call it quits, at least for the foreseeable future. You might be asking, ""Why now? Why not years ago?"" ... First off, this isn't the first time that the staple that made the Walt Disney Company what it is today has faced an almost certain death. In 1986, Disney Feature Animation Studio was on its way out the door with The Black Cauldron and The Great Mouse Detective underperforming at the box office and leaving the talented artists little hope ... That's until new management came in, cleaned things up, and, with the help of Roy Disney, brought the animation unit back to its former glory with such hits as The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Yep, that Michael Eisner sure knew what he was doing ... Who would have thought that the man who kicked started animation up again at Disney would be the one to kill it? That's the word of the day folks ... business. With computer animated features clearly outranking traditional ones, its just common business sense. But one has to wonder, with both traditional animation and Pixar out of the picture, what is Eisner thinking? ... If he's doing that at all.
The story follows a group of cows out to track down a criminal in order to collect the reward money to save their farm from being auctioned off to the highest bidder. Maggie is one head strong woman. She's rude, crude, and let's everyone know about it because she's doesn't give a hoot about what they say. She would rule the west ... if she wasn't a cow. Unfortunately for her, Maggie's former home was auctioned off after the notorious Alameda Slim took off with their prized cow herd and left the owners with next to nothing. And just when things begin to look on the way with Maggie finding a new happy home at Patch of Heaven dairy farm, the bank declares foreclosure on the farm, leaving the owner three days to pay off the $750 in order to keep the farm. Unwilling to lose another home, Maggie leads a small group consisting of Mrs. Calloway and Grace, the other two bovine residents of the farm, to search for the cow thief but they aren't the only after the larcenist. There's also Buck, a horse with high aspirations but too much enthusiasm to back it up, and Rico, the mysterious bounty hunter who has a dark secret up his sleeve, as well. In the end, it's an all out of for truth, justice, and the bovine way! The story for Home on the Range is another prime example of a plot that looks interesting on paper but clearly doesn't go anywhere once it is projected onto the big screen. The problem is that there is no emotional investment in the characters. Granted this is a children's film and it's not intended to be rocket-science or anything like that but one can make the argument that this is a family film and if the adults don't get anything out of it, who's to say that this isn't anything more then a modest diversion.
What's becoming more of a rare oddity is the use of big name stars in animated features to drive movie-goers and though none of the cast of Home on the Range is necessarily going to have people lining outside the door in giddy anticipation, they are well-known ... just how well-known depends on who you talk to. Roseanne Barr, famous for her hit television show Roseanne and more recently for her two cancelled TV programs, headlines the cast as Maggie the cow (Is there any use in inserting a joke here? All the good ones seem to have been used up). Here you have to be wondering what the cast director was thinking when they picked her up? The loud, obnoxious, and crude Roseanne was bad enough but a PG-rated version of her is even worse, if that can be imagined just from this description. Sure the kids may get a chuckle here and there from boorish antics but then so what? Cuba Gooding, Jr. voices the over ambitious Buck the horse but once again the audience is given a character they really don't care about. Buck is treated mostly as a joke with no clear sense of the justice system or what it takes to be a hero. If there was more of that in him, maybe we'd care a little more every time he seems to fail but we don't. The only real highlight in the voice cast, at least from a more mature perspective, would have to be Steve Buscemi, who makes a slight appearance voicing a pint-size partner of Alameda Slim. Why is it that this man seems to work no matter where he is placed?
Overall, Home on the Range is a disappointing and undeserving conclusion to the end of Walt Disney traditional animation and only showcases further evidence to why the genre is heading to the grave in the first place. How can traditional 2-D animation compete with the likes of Pixar with trap-holes like this? Not just on the level of visual graphics but at the story and character development levels as well. With Range, the audience is thrown head first into the plot and rushed to a predictable and dispassionate conclusion with no real emotional investment placed with the characters or the actions they take within the course of the film. Even the villain is a pathetic show ... Yodeling? Who's the genius that thought that brilliant idea up? This isn't to say that all of Home on the Range is a pointless effort. The musical score as well as the songs are enjoyable highlights but, as with most other films, if the only amusement you find is the music then save your money and buy the soundtrack. All in all, Home on the Range marks the end of a roller coaster ride for traditional animation at Disney ... One only wishes it could have ended on a better note then this.",1080864000,,5673,4.471552555448409
2072296,4,B00029LO0Y,"Critically applauded and commercially ignored, The Emperor's New Groove is one of Disney's best, and more importantly innovative, animated films (excluding Pixar releases). Home on the Range is a return to Kuzco's standards with a design very reminisent of a 1950's Tex Avery cartoon and a sparklingly funny script. Following the disappointing (Atlantis), the over-rated (Lilo and Stitch, Brother Bear) and the down-right poor (Treasure Planet) Disney required a Lion King-size hit. This wasn't it.
The sad fact is that this has been branded (no pun intended!) as Disney's last theatrical '2D' (traditinally animated) movie. Chicken Little will start the CGI ball rolling next year and Mickey Mouse has already been 'fleshed out' in Twice Upon a Christmas. This is all a shame as this film does point to Disney Feature Animation heading off in a direction away from the tried and tested (or more to the point 'tired and testing') and showing more of the spirit that resulted in films like Snow White, Fantasia, The Little Mermaid and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The problem is that this film had a lot of expectations attached to it and although it's a well written, witty (although hardly memorable) film, it's no Aladdin. Also, going back to my comparison to Emperor's New Groove this film seems to have suffered the fate of 'down-sizing' at some point as Emperor did after Dreamworks' Road to Eldorado failed to be a hit.
With Disney as erratic with it's live-action films as with it's animated - 'Pirates of the Carribbean' versus 'The Haunted Mansion' anyone? - we live in hope that the studio that started and influenced them all can still compete - and beat - Pixar, Dreamworks, Fox et al. when it comes to it's future animation. Shark Tale certainly proved that CGI does not compensate for a weak script and OTT vocal performances (stand up Will Smith!)Let's see Disney win a Best Animated Feature Oscar with out John Lasseter's help for crying out loud!
There is still a place for traditional animation in our cinemas, after all, would 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'The Lion King' flop if released now just because they weren't computer-generated? I think not. As Pixar has shown, it's the script that must always come first (perfect animation is the icing on the cake) - a motto that the House of Mouse seems to have sadly forgotten.",1074643200,13,2337,4.889168765743073

2072501,1,B00029LO0Y,"Taking place in the old west, Maggie (Roseanne Barr) is a dairy cow that is forced to move to the Patch of Heaven farm, owned by the elderly Pearl (Carole Cook), after her own ranch was raided. There she meets two other cows, Mrs. Calloway (Judi Dench) and Grace (Jennifer Tilly). Pearl is in a tough spot because the bank is about to foreclose on her farm and she does not have the money to pay. Finding out that there is a handsome reward for the capture of outlaw and cattle rustler Alameda Slim (Randy Quaid), the cows head off to try to save their home.

This movie is a real disaster for multiple reasons. The first is an absolutely dull plot and lousy script. Too many jokes in this movie are either not funny or just plain stupid. The animation often looks cheap with ugly character designs. The film made attempts to use CGI aspects, such as for trees and buildings, and the integration with the traditional hand-drawn animation is often poorly done and awful looking. Roseanne Barr, who voices the leading character, comes off as more obnoxious than anything else. The main villain was hopelessly lame. The songs in the movie were mostly forgettable. It is astounding that the legendary Alan Menken failed in his work on this film.

Home on the Range is the type of movie that cannot seem to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be. They put in some rather obvious adult jokes (the most egregious of which is the often talked about ""Yeah, they're real."" line), but the whole movie has a childish overtone. Why put in the adult humor in the first place? It makes no sense.

Part of the magic of Disney animation is that most of their films have universal appeal. This movie appears to be the exception to the rule. I find it difficult to imagine anyone over twelve would find much to enjoy here. After watching this film, I was left with the feeling that it was a stupid cartoon that could have easily been from some no-name indie studio and released direct-to-DVD and not released theatrically as part of the Disney animated canon. This movie really seems to be emblematic of the later years of Disney's Eisner era.

For the DVD itself, you at least get some decent bonus features including a behind-the-scenes featurette and some deleted scenes.

In short, this was a rather lame movie that will have little appeal to anyone but young children. Prepare to be disappointed.",1418947200,,2388,4.596244131455399
2072502,5,B00029LO0Y,"I thought this film was hilarious.  It's fast and to the point.  It's as pretty as a greeting card.  The artwork is very stylized (cartoony).  It's about as unDisney as you can get.  I even love the original soundtrack and bought it too.  The story involves three bovine bounty hunters trying to apprehend a cattle rustler so they can use the reward money to save their farm, Patch of Heaven.  The voice actors are inspired..........Dame Judi Dench as a cow!  (""Don't they have sarcasm where you come from?"")  Also put to good use were Roseanne Barr, Jennifer Tilly, Charles Haid, Carole Cook, Steve Buscemi, G.W. Bailey, Patrick Warburton, and Randy Quaid as the weirdest villain in Disney history (this rustler's secret weapon is yodeling!).  It's a sweet good natured story with a happy ending.  It's so cheerfully, gosh-darn cute.  What more could you want.",1417737600,,861,4.902777777777778

2072551,5,B00029LO0Y,"Disney Studios 45th full length animated feature film Home On The Range was Disney's last 2 D hand drawn animated film (at least until The Princess and the Frog came out). After some lukewarm receptions at the box office with more than a few of the most recent previous animated films they shut down the hand drawn animation department and went full CGI with the next couple of feature films.

I personally really liked Home On The Range and I think it is beautifully animated. It's full of songs that reminded me of musicals like Oklahoma. The tone of this film is a more like a Warner Brothers cartoon too with more slapstick violence than usual. The voice work is also very good which each one fitting their characters.

The Blu Ray transfer looks perfect and Disney has carried over most of the bonus material from the previous DVD edition. If you're looking to own Home on The Range, the Blu Ray is the way to go. This may not be the best Disney animated film, but it is a worthy entry in the on going Disney animation cannon and should not be passed over.",1394668800,,1061,4.435897435897436

The songs were great (although more songs could have been added). Some material (as stated by other people) may not be for young children, but that's why this movie is PG.

Does anyone even remember this film?  I do not think so.

Saturday morning TV animation, way below Disney standards.

Story, boring, who cares.  Roseanne several years after her show went off the air is the main voice talent in this one.

The music, nothing special.  This coming from Oscar winner Alan Menken.  We get the country music stuff but he still put in a bit of rock music when Roseanne's characters goes to this farm.  Made no sense with all the other country music stuff in this.

Now, one thing I like on blu rays & DVDs are extras.  I have had this complaint before-this movie that bombed at the box office and no one remembers has better extras than the August 2012 blu ray release of the 1995 Oscar winning Disney classic ""Pocahontas"".

2072675,4,B00029LO0Y,"In 2004, Disney released their 45th feature titled ""Home on the Range"" as part of the Walt Disney Animated Classics.

The animated film was to mark the final traditional animated Disney film (until Disney would return back to it in 2009) as the company would be focused on CGI animation.  The film would also mark the final Disney film to be released on VHS.

VIDEO:

""Home on the Range"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The film is quite colorful and the backgrounds, structures are well-painted.  Blacks are also nice and deep.  At the time this film was considered to be the last traditional animated film for Disney, there is some haloing on the edges at times.  But for the most part, the lighting effects, the detail of the animation is well-done and well-animated.  Video quality may not be perfect but ""Home on the Range"" does look great in HD compared to its original 2004 DVD counterpart.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Home on the Range"" is presented in 1080p High Definition, widescreen (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  Audio is dialogue and music driven and while the film is center and front channel heavy, there is good use of the surround channels.  From the stomping of the cattle or horses to the more action-based sequences. There are also moments of LFE but for this type of film, it is mostly dialogue and musical tracks front-channel heavy.

As for the music, the music is western-themed and the musical tracks include yodeling.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Home on the Range"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by producer Alice Dewey, co-writers/co-directors Will Fin and John Sanford.
  Deleted Scenes - (14:57) Featuring four deleted with filmmaker intro.
  ""Anytime You Need a Friend"" Music Video - (3:20) Featuring the Beu sisters performing ""Anytime You Need a Friend"".

  Art Review - (10:15) Art director David Cutler and background supervisor Cristy Maltese talk about the film's environments and the overall art of the film and how they were inspired to create the artwork.
  A Dairy Tale: The Three Little Pigs - (2:58) A short animated story about the three little pigs narrated by Mrs. Callow (and interrupted by various animals).
  Yodelmentary - (2:42) A featurette on how to yodel.

EXTRAS:

""Home on the Range"" comes with a slipcover case and also a DVD version of the film presented in widescreen (1:78:1), English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

An enjoyable family film that children will love but those who grew up watching Disney films may be asking themselves after watching this film, ""where is the Disney magic?"".

Granted, at the time ""Home on the Range"" was considered the final Disney animated film to be done in a traditional way, there was a lot of buzz before and after the film was released.  In a way, many Disney fans were saddened by the announcement that this film would be the last traditionally animated film and Disney would be focusing on CG.  Back then, I felt that both styles can still be done, attract a large audience and entertain people.

Personally, as much as I love CG, I wouldn't want to see every animated film come out to be CG.  So, at the time, many Disney fans were saddened (and then happy that Disney went back to creating animated films in the traditional style five years later).

With that being said, I was not a big fan of the film when it first came out but I realize that children would still enjoy it.  It's colorful, it's fun but I was expecting an exceptional Disney storyline.  Disney was on a roll with ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Alladin"", ""The Lion King"", ""Pocontas"", ""Mulan"", etc.  But ""Home on the Range"", seemed different than other Disney animated films and part of me, longs for the more emotional storylines.  But part of me, growing up with Disney films realize that these films are for a new generation of Disney fans.

For me, the story of three cows trying to save their ranch owner from debt, it's a rather simplistic story with good imagination, but storyline-wise, it was more in tune of what I would expect from a Looney Tunes cartoon, rather than a Disney animated classic.  For my young son, he enjoyed the comedy between the characters and it made him laugh.  And I realized, that as long as children are happy and that families can watch these films together with their children, that's all that matters.

As for the Blu-ray release, the film does look great on Blu-ray but there is some haloing near the edges.  Lossless soundtrack was good but not great and the special features that came with the 2004 DVD are included with this 2012 Blu-ray release. And for those traveling during this summer vacation, you also get the DVD included with the release, so it would be great to have on vacations or long commutes for the children.

""Home on the Range"" was too banal for my taste.  And sure, I can bring up my 2004 rant of my feelings of Roseanne as the main voice and how I felt it was too unusual for me to have her voicing the main character, especially opposite of Judi Dench as Mrs. Calloway and Jennifer Tilly's voice as Grace.  Talk about three different types of voice talent...

Personally, I felt ""Home on the Range"" was not so funny and even a bit light on the humor. It just lacked the Disney magic, the originality was not there and the writing was good but not great.  For Disney films, I suppose we have been spoiled so much by wonderful films  that we expect great written storylines in each film.  So, I just felt it was an average Disney animated film.  Also, as much as I enjoy Alan Menken's work, the songs of this film were not as memorable and the yodeling for me was annoying.

But I did enjoy the traditional artwork, some of the background images were beautiful to watch but ""Home on the Range"" was not as good as I hoped for it to be.  But once again, as long as the children are entertained, as a family film, it's good.  Just don't expect anything original or amazing.

But as a family film, I can recommend ""Home on the Range"".  Definitely not the best Disney animated film and a bit disappointing, but as long as your children enjoy it, for many parents, that may be enough to purchase this Blu-ray release!",1352332800,,6590,4.683797909407666
2072676,5,B00029LO0Y,"Cows, pigs, goats, horses and other farm animals bring tons of humor to this catch the bad guys to save the farm comedy.",1351209600,,120,4.260869565217392
2072677,5,B00029LO0Y,"The movie was delivered more quickly than expected.  My grandchildren, ages 6 through 10, loved this movie.  Great supplier!!  The movie held all the children's interest, which is what we always appreciate.  Would definitely purchase again from this supplier.",1347753600,,259,5.564102564102564
2072678,5,B00029LO0Y,I ordered this movie for my daughter who is 4 1/2 years old.  We watched the movie together and it was entertaining for both of us to enjoy.  I would recommend this to any family with young children.,1344470400,,199,4.2105263157894735
2072679,4,B00029LO0Y,"When Home on the Range was first released, for some reason the fate of 2-D or ""traditional"" animation was resting on it, as Disney was still in a tempestuous internal swirl and did not yet own, nor at the time have hope to stay attached to, the formidable Pixar -- who to this day, have had an unbroken string of films with strong, and usually gigantically successful openings.

It seems odd now to pin such hopes on such an unpretentious film, one that revels in its non-CG-ness and harkens back to the sunny Disney vistas of Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan and the lesser-known Saga of Windwagon Smith.

The performance of Home on the Range at the box office is less a refection of its quality than simply that there wasn't much of an audience for cartoon westerns starring cows in 2004. When you strip away its history and look at the film on its own (and many will today when they watch the new Blu-ray/DVD), you have a highly entertaining romp with fun characters, a loose story, some magnificent artwork and top animation.

Most of all, there some really fine songs, especially ""Little Patch of Heaven"" and the haunting ""Will the Sun Ever Shine Again"" (the latter been inspired in part, according to composer Alan Menken, by the despair following 911).

While the leading cast received much attention, one of the nicest things about Home on the Range is that it also employed such talented actors as SCTV's Joe Flaherty as Jeb, the goat, and, in particular, Carole Cook as Pearl. Cook was a close friend and proteg of Lucille Ball and played Bessie in the beloved film, The Incredible Mr. Limpet.

Watching and listening to the generous bonus features, it is evident that a great deal of skill and creativity goes into a film like this, so it cannot be dismissed as mere fluff, though it certainly does not leave you with the same glow as Beauty and the Beast. Nor it is intended to do so.

The most comical thing in retrospect turns out to be that a lighthearted animated movie about cows could be held up as the deciding factor in the future of cel animation. Of course, it didn't happen that way, and there have been other traditional features since, including last year's well-received and exquisite Winnie the Pooh.",1342137600,,2218,4.631043256997455
2072680,2,B00029LO0Y,"The early 2000s weren't very kind to Disney's animated films. Although I liked many of the movies they released at the time, they didn't seem to resonate with audiences and gain that ""instant"" classic badge of honor that many of the studios works like ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" earned in the 1990s. Disney decided it was time to release a couple of those movies from the 2000s on Blu-ray and ""Home on the Range"" is one of them.

In the movie, three cows from different walks of life embark on a journey to capture an outlaw and collect the reward. The reward is exactly the amount of money they need to save the farm they live on from a greedy land grabber intent on buying up all the property in that area. They partner up with different animals along the way and battle others to keep their home.

""Home on the Range"" isn't a bad film. It's just not memorable. Nothing about it screams classic. There are no princesses, knights in shining armor, or magical dragons. It's just boring old talking animals and people. Where's the fun in that? Of course there's the message of: ""Home is where the heart is."" It just doesn't seem to have the same impact as seeing the good guy slay a dragon for his sweetheart to prove: ""Love conquers all.""

One reason most animated Disney films gain popularity is because of their musical numbers. All the greats which come to mind had songs you left humming after seeing them. Think about all the movies like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Peter Pan,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and decades of others. ""Home on the Range"" really doesn't have a single memorable tune in it. The only reason I even remember the villain's song is because he yodeled funny in it. Academy Award winner Alan Menken dropped the ball on this one. I guess every song you compose can't be a hit, though.

The audio and video quality for the film looks better than it ever has before thanks to its high definition transfer. The picture is clean for the most part and the 5.1 surround is utilized through the soundtrack, background noises, and sound effects like whistling trains, gunshots, and such. Viewers will be happy with the format upgrade to Blu-ray.

I'll give credit to Disney for packing the release with enough special features to keep consumers happy. There's a bonus short entitled ""Dairy Tales: The Three Little Pigs."" Four deleted scenes are introduced by the filmmaker. There are three featurettes including ""Trailblazers: The Making of 'Home on the Range,'"" ""Art Review,"" and one about the history of yodeling called ""Yodelmentary."" Feature commentary is provided by co-writers/co-directors Will Finn and John Sanford and producer Alice Dewey. Deleted jokes and a music video round out the bonus material.

""Home on the Range"" isn't a bad movie. It's just not up to par with a lot of the films Disney releases that so many people cherish. The new Blu-ray + DVD Combo pack will definitely be attractive to collectors of any and everything the Mouse House has put out. This will please you if you're looking for the definitive high definition version of the film.",1342051200,,3089,4.711111111111111

Of the many great animated Disney movies deserving of the blue ray treatment, this is by far one that should never be considered. It's like last call at a bar and you are not sure if it's a masculine girl or not that you seen alone in a dark corner, but it's late and that little voice of reason that can barely be heard not to do something stupid......yeah, this is that time.

2072733,5,B00029LO0Y,"Home on the Range is a 2004 Disney animated feature film starring Roseanne Barr(Roseanne's Nuts!), Dame Judi Dench(As Time Goes By), Jennifer Tilly(Family Guy) and 1996 Oscar winner Cuba Gooding, Jr.(Daddy Day Camp). In this film, three cows-Maggie(Roseanne), Mrs. Caloway(Dench)and Grace(Tilly)-were living peacefully on a dairy farm when they learn that the farm is endangered of being forclosed and the money they need is the same amount of the reward for a crafty and ruthless yodeling cattle-rustler named Alameda Slim(Randy Quaid), so they travel out to the frontier to capture Slim, only to be rivalled by a wisecracking, karate-kicking horse named Buck(Gooding). At first, the cows and Buck at odds with each other but eventually they worked together to go after Slim and save the farm. The music featuring k.d. lang, Tim McGraw, Bonnie Raitt and The Beu Sisters were wonderful to listen to and the comedy was a hoot. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film and an animated short featuring the gang from Home on the Range as well as sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like Mulan Special Edition.

The horse is great, with wonderful voice-acting...and that brings me to the cows. The real deal with this film is that it stars women, and the characters are women, bovine women. Each one is wonderful, and their interaction is hugely entertaining.

On top of that the music is really good, not something you cringe at, and think, oh well, that's Disney. K.D. Lange, Bonnie Raitt, and Tim McGraw are all class acts, and each of the songs here are great! The animation takes a little getting used to, but I've become fond of it.

The money from the bounty will go to save the farm and pay off the bank. With the exception of the beautiful artwork the story is not that great. Even all the extra bonuses in the DVD could not save this movie and it only gets a C from me.

2072781,1,B00029LO0Y,"HOME ON THE RANGE is rock-bottom Disney animation.  It's amazing to believe the studio that produced memorable classics could turn out a movie as bad as this (yes, it's worse than HERCULES and TREASURE PLANET).  The wire-thin storyline, which involves barnyard animals on the trail of an outlaw who can hypnotize animals by singing (huh?) is needlessly stretched out for 76 minutes (which is 70 minutes too long) with forced, unfunny gags, frantic but lifeless sequences and lame characterizations.  The animation, usually a high point in a Disney feature, is both pedestrian and unappealing to look at.  Alan Menken supplies the music, but like the movie, his tunes are banal, insepid, and unappealing, even weaker than his work for HERCULES.  Failed Disney cartoons don't have to be this horrific; case in point:  THE BLACK CAULDRON and ATLANTIS-THE LOST EMPIRE fell short financially and were flawed, but both movies made an attempt to be something more complex and adult-oriented than typical Disney fare (I actually liked both of those films).  This film, on the other hand, is a big step backward, and the hectic, pedestrian execution ultimately cripples it.  It was disheartening that this was declared at the time to be Disney's last traditionally animated feature, and even more unfortunate that they chose to go out with a flop as insidious as this.  Uncle Walt would surely turn over in his grave if he found out his studio ever produced this film.  Luckily, John Lasseter would salvage the Disney animation studio's reputation with better titles, as HOME ON THE RANGE, hideous as it was, proved not to be the final nail in the coffin for Disney after all.",1181779200,7,1667,4.985559566787003

Three dairy cows go out on a search to save their farm from being auctioned off and to capture the most notorious cattle rustler in the west, Alameda Slim.

So what if it's no Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, what matters to me is that I came out of the theatre feeling happy and loving the characters.  Better than not smiling at all.  And I believe it was a better note to end than the Black Cauldron or Atlantis.  My favorite character was Grace.

2072809,2,B00029LO0Y,"`Home on the Range' is not as terrible as you might be led to believe after watching the disappointing results on the US box-office, but still it is painfully clear that Disney is no longer what it used to be when it was making glorious `The Beauty and the Beast' and charming `Little Mermaid.' The company's deep-seated problems about animation making have been discussed elsewhere - like its ill-advised decision of making so-called cheapquels - so, let's not talk about it right now, but `Home on the Range' shows how this prestigious studio lost its creative power in such a short time.

[WEAK STORY] No one can deny this. In fact, the story of `Home on the Range' has certain potential, but the film misses every opportunity to make good use of it. The film actually starts promisingly. Three cows travel to catch a notorious thief for reward, in order to save the ranch where they live from bankruptcy. There are adventures, friendship, and several funny supporting characters, all voiced by capable cast including Roseanne (as Roseanne Barr who is just brilliant).

[WHY? COWS?] Still seen as a whole, `Home on the Range' doesn't add up to much partly because the film has no pivotal theme. It shows the love/ hate relations between a trio of the traveling cows just a little; it shows musical numbers a little; a wacky jokes a little (hypnotized cows by yodeling); a funnyman a little (very funny Steve Buscemi); a funny horse a little (equally good Cuba Gooding Jr.); and finally, `Indiana-Jones'-like actions a little. The film is very short (less than 80 minutes), but tried to do so many things.

But probably more fundamental thing is this. Why cows? I thought the same thing while recently watching `Chicken Little,' but some animals cannot just look interesting or charming when translated into the world of animated films. Unlike dogs, cows look the same, and I couldn't see much difference between the three bovine heroines. I don't say cows are dull creatures, but still are not the best choice to make a film about. And though Roseanne Barr and Jennifer Tilly are convincing as ... well, cows (and Barr and Tilly fit in the roles nicely) the idea of Judi Dench as English aristocratic cow never looks good to me, and the voice of Dench sounds very uncomfortable, a bit too theatrical for this media.

Perhaps I should not accuse the directors of making the film's uninspired storytelling (for adults, I mean). If what I hear from them on DVD is true (and there is no reason to doubt it), there must have been so many changes even from the pre-production stage. You often hear this: changed story, deleted scenes, reaction from the test audience, etc. Now it is a well-known fact that major studios attempt to `adjust' the film to the supposed taste of the supposed audience. Perhaps it is the real culprit of the disappointing works from these studios. I am not sure. But the film has beautiful hand-drawn images and good songs, and if the story fails to match them, that's the most likely explanation for that.",1141948800,,3030,4.765714285714286

2072811,2,B00029LO0Y,"Does the relative box office failure of ""Home on the Range"" signal the end of the kind of hand-drawn animated films that helped make Disney an international trademark and a household name?  Hard as it may be for purists of the genre to accept, the sad truth is that any cel-based work would have to be pretty darn impressive to win back an audience that has, in the last decade or so, grown accustomed to the sophisticated computer-generated graphics of the ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"" movies.  Unfortunately, ""Home on the Range"" turns out to be as old-school and retro in its storyline and theme as it is in its style and form.

In this amiable but dull tale set in the Old West, three cows take matters into their own hooves when the farm on which they reside is threatened with foreclosure and liquidation at auction.  To rustle up funds to prevent this from happening, the three bovines go in search of Rico, an outlaw with a hefty price on his head, and encounter many adventures along the way.

Roseanne Barr, Steve Buscemi, Judi Dench, Randy Quaid and Cuba Gooding Jr., among others, do yeoman voiceover work, but the screenplay doesn't give them much in the way of drama and wit to work with.  At best the jokes are only mildly amusing, and the few double entendres the filmmakers have included sound strangely inappropriate emanating from a movie aimed, essentially, at a very young audience (and the only ones likely to be entertained by this).  Compared to what modern youngsters are used to in the way of animation, the visual style here, though bright and colorful, is, at best, rudimentary and, at worst, primitive.

It's possible that someday traditional animation will mount a well-deserved comeback;  until that time, consider this to be the final nail in the genre`s coffin.  R.I.P.",1134777600,3,1796,4.764516129032258

2072813,3,B00029LO0Y,"I saw this movie with a lot of anticipation. After 'The Emperor's New Groove' revived some of my faith in Disney's animation studio, I ran out to catch some more Disney action with this movie...but was saddened. I don't want to use the word 'disappointed' because I don't think it really sums up what I feel. I was a child of the 90's and have no other memory of Disney except the grandeur, splendor, and absolute magic that was Disney animation a la 'The Little Mermaid', 'Aladdin', 'The Lion King', 'Pocahontas', 'Mulan' and 'Tarzan'. So, with each subsequent Disney movie, I hastily run to the theater with hopes that this next animated feature will resurrect Disney's authority in the world of animation. However, 'Home on the Range' didn't acheive that. It just saddens me to see Disney falling lower and lower on the scales of the animation world. This movie felt like it was written by people that weren't professionals; it was short, un-funny, and indeed felt like a really long Warner Brother's short, sans any humor. The only funny part was when all the cows were hypnotized, reminiscient of ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" from 'Dumbo'. I gave it 3 stars because it was ""cute"" and a bit creative, and was overall an ok movie. It just did not in any way live up to Disney's past victories.  All in all, this movie just makes me more anxious for another superb Disney feature to come out. I really hope the execs at Disney take the lack of success of this movie, as well as the lack of success of the vapid 'Treasure Planet' and realize that Disney fans are yearning for Disney's good ole' magical animation.  That's what Disney is: an animation studio. That's what they built their empire on, and that's what they should primarily do.  All the fans still believe the studio can pull it off, they just need to get their butts in gear.",1129593600,,1838,4.614678899082569

Then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before. Still, I went into the movie theater ready to give ""Home On The Range"" a chance...

...and fell asleep. I found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak. I admit the animation is fine (but not spectacular) and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between. Apparently ""Home On The Range"" was meant to be released before ""Brother Bear"" but because of story issues it was delayed. I don't think it should have been made in the first place. It has also ruined the work laid out by ""Brother Bear"" for a new Disney renaissance. I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired, because not only is it terrible, but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney, a massive loss to the entertainment industry.

The issue I have is that Disney stated that no one was going to see the 'cartoon movies' anymore. That is only because they haven't written/drawn a 'smart' movie for a long time. People are looking for another Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan,and Little Mermaid. This movie doesn't match up to those.

It was just meant to be funny. I thought it was hilarious. I despise Rosanne Barr's annoying twangy voice, but it fit well into the role of Maggie the Cow. Gotta love Dame Judi Dench (Mrs. Caloway) and Jennifer Tilly (Grace). The musical score was very good. K.D. Lang has a beautiful voice people!

2072830,3,B00029LO0Y,"It took me quite awhile to watch ""Home On The Range.""  I bought it for my daughter not long after it came out, and she has watched it a few times, but I never got around to viewing it. For some reason, it just lacked the appeal of other Disney fare. Well, last night my daughter and I sat down to look at this flick together.  About thirty minutes into it, my daughter was called off to go to bed.  I was also tired, but I was too caught up in this little Disney movie, so I stayed up late.

I really want to love ""Home On The Range"" because it has so much going for it.  It has some great voices in it thanks to the lovely Jennifer Tilly, Dame Judi Dench, Randy Quaid, and Cuba Gooding, Jr.  It had wonderful songs written by Alan Menken and performed by k.d. lang and Bonnie Raitt.  There was a neat little storyline and some wild West adventure.  The animation was refreshingly ""biting""(if that's an accurate term).I really liked those parts of this film.

However, the parts I wasn't so impressed with are what keep me from giving this movie more than three stars.  For all of the great voices in this film, the one voice that shrieked and grated me into insanity was that of Roseanne Barr.  Her voice(and attitude, I might add)was annoying.  She almost ruined this film with her name alone.  The second thing that bugged me about this movie was that Menken's lovely songs were hampered by the voice of cowboy-wannabe, Tim McGraw.  Why doesn't he just let his wife look pretty and cut some more pop albums?  The guy has the emotion of a flounder in his voice.

If you can look beyond those two glaring atrocities in this film, you'll probably enjoy it.  It feels more like a direct-to-video/DVD flick than a ""major motion picture,"" but since it is storied to be the last hand-drawn animated feature from Walt's company, it will just have to suffice.

I was wrong!

There is little to recommend for parents and children alike. The characters are not that interesting and the plot seems better suited for a television special than a full-blown screen story.
The songs are far from memorable and the animation, as others have said, is too simplistic for a major motion picture.

The story concerns three cows, Mrs. Caloway, Grace, and Maggie, who must find a way to save their home, Little Patch of Heaven, from the auction block.

Going against bounty hunter Ricco and his borrowed hero-wannabe horse, Buck (Cuba Gooding Jr), our three heronies set out the get the bad guy. Plenty of action, beautifully rendered artwork (the scenic stuff is pure magic), and quirky characters (the three little pigs are especially fun -- and they get their own special treatment in a bonus short on the DVD!).

2072850,2,B00029LO0Y,"""Home on The Range"" is, to be blunt, kind of a disaster.  The story about a bunch of cow's who try to catch an outlaw for reward money to save their home is an unoriginal idea, but you can even take an unoriginal idea and still have a good movie...provided you found a way to make it fun.  ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"" were not terribly original movies, but the execution for both of them were excellent, which is why those movies are still loved by many people of all age's years after they were finished.  ""Home on The Range"" is (as you've most likely heard) the final traditionally animated film from Disney, who gave us one of the greatest legacy's of all time.

Unfortunately someone seriously dropped the bomb on this one.  The animation for this movie is pretty weak, sometimes looking like a direct-to-video movie...in fact, had Disney not claimed this movie to be one of their main animated features, then I would have thought that this WAS a direct-to-video feature!  This movie contains some high celebrity voices like Roseanne Barr and Cuba Gooding Jr., but none of these voices are inspired choices, and they don't leave a lasting impression like Robin Williams or Jody Benson as the Genie and Arial respectively.  There was some hope that the music for this movie would be excellent since Alan Menken (who's written some of Disney's best songs) was writing the music, yet even the music disappoints on many levels.

The songs sound like they come from an old 50's western movie, and ultimately the songs aren't very memorable in any way.  Even a song by the great Tim McGraw fails to trigger much emotion from the audience.  The DVD special features are mostly weak promotional fluff, yet the deleted scene's are interesting.  The deleted scene's show several different directions and idea's the film was supposed to have but wasn't working for the director's, yet some of these deleted scene's are funnier then most of the stuff in the actual movie.

What's even more interesting is that all these story board scene's are voiced by the actual actors, and some of the scene's even have some completed animation.  I always wondered how a cheap looking movie that is just a little over an hour long managed to cost over $100 million dollars, but from the looks of the deleted scene's and a commentary where the director's bring up several things they started but then cut out, I'm guessing the huge budget was spent mostly on work that didn't even get completed.  Considering how much of the movie they changed, and how much actual animation Disney finished that ended up being scrapped because they weren't happy with it, I have to wonder why the film makers didn't take this as a sign that maybe the movie just wasn't working at all.

I'm also going to take a moment to criticize the ridicules PG rating that this film was given to by the MPAA.  I don't know what the MPAA has been smoking lately, but to even THINK that ""Home on The Range"" needs to be previewed by parents before showing this film to kids is pure lunacy, as this movie is about as kid friendly as they come these days.  Considering that there is no real violence, the ""crude humor"" is more silly then crude, and the fact that the story seems geared towards toddlers lead me to believe that this movie would be a good baby sitter then anything.  I'm disappointed that this was the final hand drawn animated film from Disney instead of ""Brother Bear"" (which might not have been a GREAT Disney film but at least a very good Disney film), but who knows, if this is all they could come up with then maybe traditional animation does need a breather.  Doesn't mean I can't be disappointed with the results though.",1097452800,3,3684,4.64
2072851,1,B00029LO0Y,"Home on the Range was an embarrassing mess for Disney.  They need to do something fresh and new to bring them out of this depression.  This film was sheer garbage.  Imagine, if you were a family of seven going to see this film, dishing out quite a large chunk of change only to enjoy no laughs, a pre-structured overused Disney plot, and just a hair under 70 minutes.  Where is the value in this?  Imagine spending nearly $25.00 for this type of rubbish.  Well, there are those that are and it will forever perplex me.  This film was a disaster from the beginning, and it never seemed to stop.  There was only one point in this film that I enjoyed watching and it was the scene where the train jumps the tracks and heads into ""Patch of Heaven"".  This was hysterical because I thought Disney was making a reference (perhaps some symbolism) of this film and the direction it was headed.  Maybe they weren't, but that was the way that I understood it.

I can successfully say that after watching this film, Disney is one of the most uncreative, predictable, unimaginable studios out there.  Their ability to think outside of the box has disappeared and will be forever lost on a new generation of children.  They have lost their grasp on their ""bread and butter"" formula, and need to stop drawing films by hand.  I think this was a perfect example of why.  Home on the Range was stale.  It was stale from the moment you opened the packaging to the moment the final credits rolled.  The formula, characters, and even the songs were extremely stale.  What has happened to their creative team?  What has happened to the magic?  None of it was used to make the film Home on the Range.

First, where were the big name actors lending their voices to make this film spectacular?  If you are not going to use the modern computer animation, than at least make the voices somewhat spectacular.  This was not the case here, instead we are forced to endure 70 minutes of C-grade actors forcing themselves through the words.  Jennifer Tilly did not seem to match her character at all, while Roseanne was horribly cast as the independent bovine.  It almost felt as if this film was made for the actors instead of for the mass audiences.  The only redeeming voice was Steve Buscemi, and it seemed like they wrote the part for him directly.  Apparently he is their A-grade star.  Pathetic, while I love Buscemi's work, he deserved better and the rest of this cast only made him sound cheap.

Second, where was the meat to this story?  Sorry about the pun, but there was nothing of value in this film.  Even the patented Disney songs didn't seem to have the luster they once did.  Everything from the background effects to the secondary characters seemed to be just, for lack of a better word, ""half-assed"".  I felt that there was no heart in this story.  Disney, trying to counter those audiences that were dishing out money to see Shrek and other better-animated films, just jumbled anything they could in a quick moment.  There was no force or brilliance to this story.  Even the jokes, which I was hoping would at least keep some of my attention, were short lived and dull.  Nothing was funny.  Leading me to watch the story, which went by in a whirlwind and left only devastation behind.  It took Maggie all of three seconds to fit into the farm, there was no animosity or hesitation to these other animals meeting and accepting her.  It took us all of five seconds to get to the Disney song, and finally, it took only ten seconds to get to the Disney break-up (where the characters leave on their own only to discover that they need each other).  This was no time for us to feel anything for these characters.  I knew nothing about any of them, so whenever they did anything (sorry to be vague) I didn't understand why.  I needed more, and this gave me nothing.

Finally, I would like to end with this comment.  I am not against hand drawn animation, when it is done creatively and with passion behind the story and characters.  This was not the case with this film.  Disney is going to continue to plummet unless they try to find a new way to bring these films out.  They need a fresh edge, something for our new generation to enjoy.  This cookie-cutter style is not going to work, and it is obvious with this film that it is a dying formula.  I guess I am trying to plead with Disney, I am a child of your films.  I have seen nearly all of them, and still watch some of them today, but with these new releases it is becoming obvious that you have moved from children to greed.  The originality and honesty is gone.  You have gone to mass marketing to whoever is willing to pay, and that is what is causing you to fail, both in film and in the box office.  Revamp and return, and I will give you a second chance.  If I see anything like Home on the Range again, I may just have to give up on you forever.  The magic is gone.

2072855,5,B00029LO0Y,"I'm so pleased that Disney finally steered away from the forgettable scores and uninspiring lyrics that we've been seeing since the 70s.  I was surprised and pleased with the music in this film.  My 4 year old daughter and I are having a great time trying to yodel like Alameda Slim; we crack up to the lyrics of the main title song, like: ""If you're the type with a nervous bladder, YEE-HAW! Your saddle's gonna reek;"" and I just adore singing that lovely ""Little Patch of Heaven"" song.

I was really hesitant to see this movie because it got some pretty shoddy reviews, but I gave in and rented it, then ended up buying it a day later.  The movie has all kinds of little tidbits for adults, and lots of hilarious action for the kids.  In the director commentary it was said that the reason the movie got the PG rating was that Maggie the cow says, of her udder:  ""Yeah, they're real... quit staring.""  The bad guy seems scary at first, but he's ends up being pretty non-threatening.  There are plenty of head bangs and punches in the movies, but they've managed to keep it somewhat PC.  The flavor of the violent 40s and 50s cartoons is there (yes, I'm one of those Bugs Bunny fans), but not so many things that could actually be acted out by children in real life (who could drop a cow onto someone?).  The storyline is NOT the most amazing I've ever seen.  There were no real suprises.  Each little piece of the story is really great, though; cute and funny... like cartoon vignettes.  I could've watched each chapter on the DVD in random order and still been really satisfied.

The additional features on the DVD are good.  My daughter really likes the ""yodel-mentary"" and we all like the short film ""Three Little Pigs.""  The introductions to the menu are pretty cute (I think there are 3 different introductions).  The English subtitles are perfect, if you're into that kind of thing.  We both like to watch this movie in French, too.  The voices are dubbed wonderfully, and they've even translated the songs, and done them well!  I'm fond of ""making-of"" documentaries, and while this one was a little hokey (why did they have to set the documentary at a dude ranch, and have movie makers sit around the campfire and try to remember the song lyrics?), I DO like that it contained a lot of real insight into how the movie evolved.

I think that this is the first Disney animated movie for a long time that is a real pleasure to watch over and over.  I admit that a tiny bit of my admiration of this film is because of subject matter (we own a farm in the west ourselves).  I know that a lot of people get upset because no new Disney movies are like the ones they grew up with.  The movies that were in the theatres when I was a kid were mostly re-releases of the 60s... everyone knows those movies are supposed to be terrible... but I can't help it: I love Sword in the Stone and Robin Hood but can't stand Lion King.  Your high expectations will never be met by new Disney movies; they'll never seem as wonderful and magical as the ones you saw as a kid.  This movie is NOTHING like any other Disney movie.  There's no point in trying to compare.

By the way, those chickens on Patch of Heaven shouldn't be laying white eggs; they really look like brown egg layers to me.  (Sorry... I just couldn't resist that one little dig!)",1096502400,4,3333,4.409165302782324

2072858,4,B00029LO0Y,"I had seen the previews for this movie and hadn't thought much of it. A few days ago while staying home with a sickly 3 year old I decided to treat her to a movie rental. We picked this DVD up and watched it together. She thought the movie was hysterical and sat entranced the whole time. There was a lot going on and the voices were very entertaining. She even understood the emotions of the characters. I myself, thought this movie was adorable and one of the better Disney flicks of late. The formatting of the movie goes back to the old ""Fox and the Hound"" days, but the color was very vibrant and the Old West scenes were pretty to look at.

I am not sure why some are giving this movie such a hard time. I thought that the yodelling rustler was a riot and the idea of how he rustles was a brilliant one. There was some mild violence, but nothing more than Lion King and nothing as bad as Lilo and Stitch. Hardly any negativity in this movie, the animals were very sad to think they would have to be auctioned off.

2072860,4,B00029LO0Y,"Home on the Range"" sees the closure of the traditional animation unit at Disney after a successful 44 film legacy that began with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". It's a sad fact of life that CGI has become the dominate form for animation. It's a pity as I could easily see the two co-existing. A very funny comedy, ""Home on the Range"" tells the story of three cows, a karate kicking horse named Buck and others from the farm who try and prevent the foreclosure of their home the Patch of Heaven diary farm. An evil and greedy outlaw named Alameda Slim (Randy Quaid) wants the land for himself. He uses his unique hypnotic yodeling to lure the cattle away from the farm in hopes of shipping them off to less green pastures. Featuring songs performed by The Beu Sisters, k. d. lang, Bonnie Riatt and Tim McGraw, ""Home on the Range"" is a marvelous and funny cartoon that the whole family can enjoy. The breezy direction by Will Finn and John Sanford (who also wrote the script) along with a witty script make this last traditional animated feature a Disney classic from the get go.

A beautifully rendered transfer free of analog or digital blemishes, the 1.66:1 aspect ratio means that this film will look great on both traditional TV sets and widescreen models as well. The bright colors and smooth animation come to life in a carefully wrought DVD. The sound doesn't have any hint of compression errors and comes across with tremendous presence and a nice spread in the surround speakers.

Disney corrals a whole bunch of features for the DVD. We get a very funny animated short ""A Diary Tale: The Three Little Pigs"" which also played with the movie in theaters. There's also four deleted scenes with introductions by the director/writers. While some of the deleted scenes aren't quite finished, they're quite charming. The directors provide their reasoning behind cutting these scenes. There's a great little music video ""Anytime You Need a Friend"" incorporating some of the elements from the feature. We also get a 16 minute documentary on the making of the film which provides lots of neat tidbits that even kids will enjoy. Finally we have three games/activities for the kids. The ""Yodel Memory Game"" and ""Yodel Maker DVD-ROM"" will provide distraction for a couple of hours. While their not up to the more advanced DVD-ROM games we've seen introduced on movies for tweens and teens, their fun enough where most kids will enjoy them. We also get ""The Joke Corral"" which features jokes that were deleted from the feature film for one reason or another. A funny and entertaining commentary track from the directors will keep animation buffs entertained. There are moments here that will be over most kids heads though.

 If this is, indeed, the last traditional animation feature we see from Disney (the company's Australian unit will continue to produce direct-to-video and TV fare in the traditional hand drawn style), then it's a great farewell that matches some of the best Disney has produced over the years. It may not quite have the appeal of ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" but its atmosphere of Looney Tunes humor crossed with the more traditional witty Disney humor makes it a worthwhile movie to watch with the kids. The extras might make this worth purchasing for most parents as well. The DVD-ROM features will provide a bit of entertainment independent of the feature film and the short cartoon and music video are also fun. Although this didn't do all that well at the box office (it only pulled in roughly $50 million to the $110 million budget), don't let that prevent you from viewing or purchasing this DVD.

I think this is because the bar has been raised with Shrek and other movies that plant plenty of jokes for the parents.

The problem with Home on the Range is the adult jokes are just mildly humorous.  The joke does not as much make you laugh as it makes you say to yourself, ""Oh yes, they are trying to make me laugh.  Cute.""

Well guess what, that does not really matter.  I have a four year old little girl that loves horses and a two year old boy who loves whatever his sister loves.  They talk about that movie non-stop.  And they have only seen it twice!

2072863,5,B00029LO0Y,"`Home on the Range', Disney's 44th and final hand-drawn animated movie, is a surprisingly good one. Having grown up with the wonderful animated Disney movies, I am a little disappointed that they will not be releasing any more in the future. Just as all Disney animated movies are family-fun oriented, `Home on the Range' succeeds in this manner, as it is a very casual movie filled with lovable characters.

The story comprises of a thief named Alameda Slim, who is wanted in many states for stealing herds of cattle. The farmers go broke after losing all their animals and reluctantly auction their farm for sale. Molly (voice given by Roseanne), a cow, who has lost her home due to this situation, is now brought to a new one known as `Patch of Heaven'. However, things start to go downhill, when Pearl, the owner of the farm, has to put it up for auction as well, since she cannot seem to pay the bills for keeping it. Therefore, Molly, along with two other cows named Mrs. Calloway (voice provided by Dame Judi Dench) and Grace (voice provided by Jennifer Tilly), decide to find some way to obtain the money needed to keep their farm open, by catching Alameda Slim and acquiring the reward money. However, there are many obstacles in their way, which they have to face. Will they succeed in the end?

Home on the Range may not be a classic compared to previous Disney masterpieces such as `Beauty and the Beast', `Aladdin', `Little Mermaid' or `The Lion King', but it has its own charm. The storyline of the movie is simple, giving it the charm of old Disney Classics like `The Fox and the Hound', and not too complicated like `Atlantis, the lost Empire'. The score, composed by Alan Menken, goes exceptionally well with the theme of the movie. This movie has a great selection of the casting for the voices, such as Cuba Gooding Jr. (giving the voice for the exceptionally funny horse named Buck), Roseanne, Judi Dench, Randy Quaid (providing voice for the villain Alameda Slim) and Jennifer Tilly. I suppose the main reason this movie didn't do very well in the box office was because, considering it is the last hand drawn animated movie by Disney, the audience were expecting a movie that ended Disney's animation career with a big bang. However, if you watch the movie without any high expectations, you will be surprised how good it is. This is a well-crafted Disney movie, and should not be considered as being worthless. `Home on the Range' is one of Disney's better efforts.",1094688000,10,2488,4.691075514874142

2072865,4,B00029LO0Y,"As Disney's last effort in traditional animation, this film is forever cursed with being in the shadows of all the Disney greats that came before it. Certainly it doesn't live up to the spectacular visuals of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella; its soundtrack isn't as good as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, its characters aren't as interesting as Aladdin or The Lion King, its down home humor and storytelling isn't as sophisticated as that found in Pinocchio or Snow White.

Yet all on its own, this is a delightful tale of three very different cows uniting for the common good - saving their farm, as well as all cattle from a nefarious yodeling bandit named Alameda Slim.  Roseanne Barr is very engaging and likeable in the role and really steps out of herself. Dame Judi Dench is masterful as usual, lending a fiery bravado to her role.  And the inimitable Jennifer Tilly as Grace the New Age Flake cow is hysterical, especially with the original use of tonedeafness and hypnotic yodeling as superpowers.

The soundtrack is upbeat, authentic and thoughtful - not just country but country Western in flavor, and the songs by Bonnie Raitt and kd lang stand out as most memorable.  The dialogue is intelligent and sparkles with with for virtually every character (excepting possibly the extraneous horse played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., who the movie could have easily done without).  There were a couple of very, very colorful double entendres involving bulls, cows and mating puns that raised my eyebrows, but are sure to fly over the heads of anyone under age 10.

This movie may not be ""as good as"" the giants of the Disney studio, but it's a solid effort, a funny film, with really cute characters, bold animation, and a very heartwarming tale.

2072866,3,B00029LO0Y,"""Home On The Range"" is supposed to be Disney's last picture that features traditional animation (2D), although I'm pretty sure that they are going to keep releasing straight-to-video sequels. The first animated film that Walt Disney Pictures released was ""Snow White And The 7 Dwarfs"", then the company released classics like ""Pinocchio"", ""Dumbo"", ""Fantasia"" and ""The Jungle Book"", which was the last movie that Mr. Walt Disney personally supervised.

 After Mr Disney's death, the company released a string of minor movies, but in the early 1990s, Disney returned to good shape with movies like ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"". After those movies, Disney once again started to loose some steam until a young company named ""Pixar"" release an animated masterpiece that changed the animation forever.

 That movie was ""Toy Story"", and since that movie, Pixar has made Disney's biggest hits, like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", but Disney by itself hasn't made another classic like they used to do. And its final traditional release is going to be ""Home On The Range"". Well, it's painfully obvious that this movie isn't the ideal way to say goodbye to Disney's traditional animation.

 ""Home On The Range"" is a good movie...but nothing else. It has some good jokes like those references to classic westerns like ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" or John Huston's westerns. There are some references to Disney's own classics like ""Dumbo"" or ""Alice In Wonderland"". But that's not good enough to close a historical cycle in the animation genre.

 Hopefully, Disney is going to make some good CGI-based movies, but if they don't do it, at least we can see movies made by Pixar or DreamWorks. Anyway, ""Home On The Range"" is a good movie, specially for children, but if you are old enough to know what is great, then get the movies that I mentioned in the first three paragraphs.",1091750400,,1908,4.959247648902822

""Home on the Range"", while far from the delirious heights of the best Disney movies, is still a fast-paced entertaining film with bright visuals and vivid characterizations.  Interestingly enough, the movie that most resembles ""Home On the Range"" isn't another Disney movie, it's ""An American Tail: Fievel Goes West"".  Both movies have a very similar color scheme and are more comedy than old-fashioned western.  ""Home on the Range"" may not make your spirit soar, but it provides some solid laughs and a very enjoyable outing at the movies.",1085011200,2,976,5.10062893081761
2072870,1,B00029LO0Y,"This movie is an OFFENSE to the wonderful Disney movies that were made up until Mulan.  Everything after the wonderful Mulan, has been nothing but garbage. Treasure Planet was awful. Brother Bear was even WORST! And now comes this. Who is in charge at Disney? Who has been coming up with these awful new ideas for an animated feature?  There are so many other fairy tales Disney can breathe new life into.  Yet they come up with garbage like Lilo & Stitch? and Home on the Range?  I just don't understand! Now because these movies bombed, Disney has decided that Home on the Range will be the last 2D animated feature. I read they plan on making Rapunzel, computer generated! Can you imagine how wonderful Rapunzel can be? But Disney will ruin that, by making it all CGI.  It just makes me very angry.  My advice to all of you, is to not make this purchase. Roseanne Barr's voice is horrible as it is.  To hear her lend it to an animated cow in Home on the Range, is enough to make you want to purge.",1084924800,5,1000,4.344086021505376
2072871,3,B00029LO0Y,"""Home on the Range"" may be the last hand-drawn Disney feature for the foreseeable future.  Disney is going the way of computer animation and forsaking the old ways.  That being said, ""Home on the Range"" represents Disney's animated films going out with a whimper.  Well not a bad movie, it is not a great one either.  It falls somewhere in the ""who cares?"" range, and will probably be easily forgotten.
The Patch of Heaven ranch is facing foreclosing, and the owner will not sell her cows because they are like family.  The cows get the bright idea to track down Alameda Slim, a wanted outlaw, and collect the reward that just so happens to match the amount needed for the ranch.
The voices are middle of the road too.  Roseanne Barr voices the main cow, and she is just as obnoxious sounding as ever.  Judi Dench gives us a British sounding cow, and Randy Quaid voices the bad guy.  The songs are average as well.
In the end, kids will probably enjoy it, but it may wear on adults patience.  Some adult humor is sprinkled in (giving the film a PG rating), but it actually seems out of place.  The best bet on this one would be to wait until it comes out on video.",1084406400,,1164,4.372093023255814
2072872,1,B00029LO0Y,"I originally went to see this because my daughter (3) wanted to see the ""cow"" movie.  From the comercials, I thought it would be childish and silly.  I never thought it would just be bad.  It incorporates A LOT of adult sexual humor.  It all went over my three year old's head, but I wouldn't want her to see it again and think stuff like that is ok.  There is also a lot of political and social issues brought up.  The cows are always fighting, and the horse is just annoying. The horse is trying to attain a dream to help a bounty hunter, but finds out in the last 5 minutes that he is working for the bad guy and hurts him instead. The main ""bad guy"" is a yodeler and yodels to hypnotise cattle and steal them.  All in all, it was really offensive to me.  However my daughter still wants to see the ""cow movie"" again.",1083628800,7,820,4.113207547169812
2072873,2,B00029LO0Y,"Disney/Pixar... (Yes I know they are no longer cooperating) seem to be producing many bad films as of late. Since their blatent rip off of Kimba: The White Lion (Lion King) the quality of their movies went down the drain. Although I don't like many of the early Disney Films they were still more quality than the newer films. Anyway, this film ""Home on the Range"" was funny at times but the few laughs were not enough to keep snyone intertained for any period of time

However compared to Finding Nemo and Brother Bear this movie is 10 times better than the two of those combined. Watch Beauty and the Beast, Phinnocchino (Spelling?), Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away or others. I love animated films and for children the quality just needs to be 100%.... not the 40% of this movie or the 10% of Nemo.. Thanks!!!!!1",1082592000,,965,4.583815028901734
