1248237,1,B000021Y7C,"ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME AND LITTLE WHITE HOUSE JOKES, THE MOVIE IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTIONS I HAVE EVER SEEN. NOT ONLY WAS THE CLUELESS TYPE PLOT UNAPPEALING, BUT IT ALSO WAS JUST PLAIN BORING. WHAT  WERE THESE WRITERS DOING WHEN THEY MADE THIS. THEY DEFINITELY CREATED A  BLUNT AND A FAILURE. NOTHING INTERESTING EVER HAPPENED. I SERIOUSLY DOUBT  THAT THE GIRLS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE OFFICE AND SEARCH THROUGHT  THE PERSONAL THINGS WITHOUT BEING THROWN OUT. THIS PLOT WAS JUST PLAIN  DRAGGING. DON'T SEE THIS. YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH YOUR TIME.",945388800,3,581,4.77
1248238,5,B000021Y7C,"This movie is a stirring example that they still do make em' like they used to.  I love this movie because it is sophisticated and funny without using hardly any or any potty humor at all.  I must be the only... male at my school who dosen't think Adam Sandler is the most hillarious  thing since the invention of slapstick.  This movie is definitally meant  for those individuals who know Watergate or lived through it.  That's the  only way to catch the jokes. My mother told me all about Watergate so I  knew them all.  My favorite part was at the end where Nixon is leaving the  White House in his helicopter and...well, I won't ruin it for those who  haven't seen it.  But trust me, it's great.  Betsy and Arline are the  biggest airheads I've ever seen, and it's so amazing that they were deep  throat!  This is the hidden gem of the summer season and is a must see!",944956800,8,872,4.3229813664596275
1248239,5,B000021Y7C,"Dick is a great comedy for adults.  Coming off as a kid's movie in previews, I was refreshed and surprised at the caliber of the comedy.  Every character is comical genius, all the way down to the stoner,  draft-dodging brother.  I could not stop laughing at the mad camp  adventures of these two clueless DC socialites.  I almost broke a rib!
I  can't urge you enough to buy this movie.  It is defiantly going to be a  party house favorite.",944092800,21,441,4.4125
1248240,5,B000021Y7C,"This is definitley the most overlooked movie of the year. Not only is it funny but it's also extremely smart. The razor sharp oscar worthy script by Andrew Fleming and Sheryl Longin is matched by the excellent comic timing  of Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams.
If that's not enough the  supporting cast is priceless. Will Ferrell and Bruce McCullough as Woodward  and Bernstein is nothing short of inspired. Dan Hedya's performance as Dick  is everything a supporting actor oscar is meant for.
Dave Foley and Jim  Brewer have small but funny characters worthy of their talent. Don't  remember the name of the actor who played Dunst's stoned brother but he's  also very funny.
The soundtrack accompanies the film perfectly.
Don't  be fooled by the advertising. This isn't just another formula ""teeny  booper"" movie, but rather a smart and brillant satire. I think this  DVD will give this overlooked gem the second life it deserves.",943488000,20,934,5.0064935064935066

1248348,5,B000021Y7C,"25 years after the resignation of Richard Nixon(here parodied by an accurately grouchy Dan Hedaya) five years after the 37th President's death, and six years before the world learned the true identity of the mysterious figure known as ""Deep Throat"" , director Andrew Fleming, producer Gale Ann Hurd, and writer Sheryl Login(along with fellow writer, Fleming)  presented this 94 minute political farce.
 15-year-old Betsy Jobs( Kirsten Dunst), and her best friend, Arlene Lorenzo( Michelle Williams) are amiable, golden-haired High Schoolers growing up in Washington D.C. during the early 1970s. Betsy's wealthy family reside in Georgetown, and Arlene with her widowed mother in the Watergate Apartment complex.
 One evening, as the two  try to sneak out of Arlene's home to mail a fan letter to Bobby Sherman, when  they  witness the Watergate break-in and the subsequent arrest of G. Gordon Liddy(Harry Shearer) , whom they encounter accidentally  a second time while on a school tour of the White House.
 While they don't recognize him, Liddy recognizes them. He turns them over  to H.R. Haldeman(Dan Foley), who interrogates them amid two disruptions, the second made by the President himself, who invites them to play with his dog, Checkers, and then comes up with the idea that the two should serve as the official White House Dog Walkers as a way to keep them quiet about what they saw.
 But when they become regulars at the Nixon White House, they stumble upon corrupt activity and hostile officials as they seek to return Checkers to the proper location.
 Via a secret ingredient in the cookies called Hello Dollies they take to the President, the two begin to influence world events. After a quarrel with her brother, Larry ( Devon Gummersall)  in which he snidely accuses Betsy of wanting him to die in Vietnam so she can  be an only child, she and Arlene successfully advocate for the end of the Vietnam War, and the cookies they  serve lead to a strange and uncommon rapport between the President and the Soviet Premier, Leonid Brezhnev(Len Doncheff), leading to a period of detente.
 Henry Kissinger( Saul Rubinek) is among the administration figures with whom the girls become familiar.
 Arlene develops a short-lived crush on the Commander-in-Chief, and leaves a message on his tape recorder expressing her feelings in an 18 1/2 minute session. But she and Betsy will see their illusions shatter when they play back the tape and discover Nixon's anti-Semitic comments--highly offensive to the Jewish Betsy--cruelty towards Checkers, and general hostility towards  those he considers his enemies. The two girls confront him in a volatile exchange, resulting in their dismissal an threats from the President.
 The Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward( Will Ferrell) and Carl Berenstien(Bruce McCulloch) who Nixon felt were  working to discredit him, become strong allies of the girls when they decide to inform them about the illicit goings-on.
 Initially skeptical, the two are rewarded for their aid of the two  girls amid complications, the duo--a few years too young to vote--become the legendary Deep Throat, altering the course of American History.
 Terry Garr appears as Arlene's Mom, Helen, Ted McGuinley appears as her suspicious love interest, Roderick, Ana Gasteyer is the  Presidential Secretary, Rose Mary Woods.
 The two girls persevere despite Nixon's bullying tactics, remembering that they are human beings rather than  just ""stupid teenage girls"", and use a few crafty tricks of their own to acquire evidence of the Presidential malfeasance by finagling their way into Haldeman's house.
 Amid stylish colors and a great contemporary sound track, the story concludes with a crassly biting  and acrimonious, but amusing  final confrontation as the country begins to move past the Watergate Era with two initially underestimated best friends coming out on top.",1418688000,,3892,5.24394184168013

1248392,4,B000021Y7C,"The year is 1972 and Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) are absent-minded teenagers living in Washington, D.C. who happen to witness the Watergate burglaries and visit the White House during a school field trip. When President Richard ""Dick"" Nixon (Dan Hedaya) believes the girls may know more than he wants, he keeps them silent by appointing them official White House Dog Walkers. From there, the movie goes on to twist history and comedy that sees Betsy and Arlene almost unknowingly take down the Nixon administration.

The film is a hilarious parody of the Watergate scandal and other figures and events of the Nixon presidency. Many individuals of the day are parodied and caricatured such as Dan Hedaya as Nixon, Dave Foley as H.R. Haldeman, Will Ferrell as Bob Woodward, and Bruce McCulloch as Carl Bernstein. Not only are the people caricatured, but so is the time period itself. There is plenty of references to contemporary culture, music, and, of course, fashion.

In conclusion, although there are quite a few stupid jokes in this film, it is overall a funny and silly film that can be enjoyed provided you know some things about Nixon and Watergate.",1391126400,2,1181,4.98984771573604

Wow.  Amazon really does sell everything!
I didn't remember ordering Dick, so I asked my wife if she ordered Dick.
She said, yes, she did.  She saw Dick years ago, and had fond memories of Dick.
She had been looking all over locally for Dick, and couldn't find Dick, so she checked Amazon.  Eureka!!  Amazon had Dick for sale.

So, the order was placed.  Dick was on the way, and she couldn't have been happier.

I just want to say that we sat down and enjoyed Dick together, and most couples should take the time to experience Dick together.

1248397,4,B000021Y7C,"This cleverly crafted comedy will resonate with those who were older teens or adults in the Watergate-Nixon period. Without painting a more benign Nixon, it creates silly alternatives for some of the unexplained events surrounding Watergate. Still it is a PG teen comedy that may not appeal to many adults.",1382918400,,306,5.14

1248399,5,B000021Y7C,"Yes, It's about ""Tricky-Dick"" President  Nixon. Oh, Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams lick lollipops and there are a few silly references to ""Dick"" which some people may take the wrong way, but basically it's a squeaky-clean movie. Two  innocent and clueless teenage girls bring down Nixon via the Watergate Scandal. It's a clever send-up of how it might have all happened, if  told by ""Saturday Night Live"".  A dead-on humorous impression of Nixon as a sleazy and paranoid man. For people over 35, it is screamingly funny, but a younger audience may not get all the '60's jokes. Great costumes and sets. Fun 1960's pop music soundtrack. Very talented supporting cast. Reporters Woodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post are portrayed as bumbling idiots--maybe they were? Kirsten and Michelle are absolutely adorable and all the adults act like idiots. It's hilarious.",1381363200,2,874,5.177304964539007

But, I was not around during Watergate and I have to say I don't remember any details of it from high school (other than Nixon and the tapes and him pretty much causing all his own problems), so maybe I can say I have a few more details now?

Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams were totally hilarious. They may have been ditzy, but they were cute. Who cares if the intelligence wasn't there yet?

1248431,5,B000021Y7C,"I teach Journalism in high school, and have long wanted a good movie to show the complexity and craziness and drama of Watergate.

""All the President's Men"" is not it.  ""Dick"" definitely is.

""All the President's Men"" is dull and opaque and gets lost in minutiae--it's hard to follow even for me, and I know oceans about Watergate--so it is completely lost on the students.  Worse still, it's undramatic.  It has a plodding pace and dull characters.

""Dick"" is the opposite.  It was a stroke of genius to treat Watergate as a comedy, and better yet, a teen comedy.

It was another stroke of genius to make the clueless teen heroines ""Deep Throat""--the mysterious informant who kept feeding Woodward and Bernstein an unending supply of truth about Nixon's and all his advisers' involvement.  (""Dick"" was made in 1999; the actual identity of Deep Throat was not revealed till 2005.)

And it was perhaps the crowning stroke of genius to provide Nixon with marijuana cookies as the spark behind several of his better policies--ending the Vietnam war, the nuclear weapons treaty with Brezhnev, etc.

(Side note.  Grace Slick, in her autobiography, tells how Julie, Nixon's daughter, invited Slick to the White House for some function, because Julie and Slick had gone to the same college.  Slick decided to go, and slip Tricky Dick some LSD.  This was a brilliant plan, but fortunately did not succeed.  The thought of Dick's head on acid and his finger on the Bomb is not a pretty one.)

""Dick"" has wonderful touches.  Hedaya is perfect as Nixon--looks, voice, evil, paranoia.  It is lovely that he can't remember his daughters' names.  The actors playing Haldeman, Kissinger, Dean, et al. are also good.  The episodes involving the lost 18 minutes of tape are priceless.

The movie is dumb but extremely likable.  It gets the songs, the clothes, the slogans, the silliness and fun of the early 70s just right.  Plus, it's actually quite educational.",1337385600,9,1946,4.901840490797546

1248433,4,B000021Y7C,"Dick, 1999 film

The movie starts with a view of an electric typewriter and two girls who are love with the current popularized singer. Two men across from the Watergate complex watch their apartment. Putting tape over a latch prevents the door from locking. A guard sees this and calls the police. A man with a flashlight finds them in a stairwell; the girls flee. The news tells about the burglary and the arrests. The girls visit the White House on a tour. [There are comic comments.] A man invites them to the West Wing. ""I don't really think about him."" Do dogs like Nixon? ""Are you the President's dog trainer?"" Official White House Dog Walkers? Is that Constitutional? The girls have a good excuse for being late but are not believed. The brother is drafted. ""The President always means what he says."" The girls use a secret recipe to bake cookies for the President. [Do they look fifteen?"" ""Stupid kids."" The girls visit the White House again for another comic scene. ""The President will see you now.""

""It's a secret recipe."" The secret taping machine is turned on. ""Don't worry your pretty little heads."" ""Wow!"" The girls enter a room that has cash and shredded paper. The girls will be Secret Youth Advisors. The President speaks to the nation (January 1973). Are the girls believed? They bring more cookies to the White House. ""Groovy!"" Soviet Premier Brezhnev loves the cookies too. [High sugar content?] Have they saved the world from a nuclear catastrophe? [Too good to be true?] Arlene dreams of Nixon, as if in a commercial. Who are those ""snot nose reporters""? Arlene telephones Nixon, he knows nothing about Watergate. Can he do something for her or her family? ""Why does the President need a lawyer?"" [Everybody needs a lawyer at some time in their lives.] The girls find a tape machine hidden in a desk drawer. Arlene leaves a message: ""I love you"". She talked for eighteen and a half minutes! They play back the tape. Should the President record conversations like that? [Yes, it goes back a long way.] Those `Washington Post' reporters are liars. ""What dog?"" Nixon has a report on them. Overdue library books! ""Get out and never come back!"" ""Its too late for apologies.""

Arlene falls out of love, those photos are burned in the house. [No smoke alarms.] The girls whisper about a movie. One calls Bob Woodward about things. Does she have documents? Yes, a list of names and cash amounts. They will meet in an underground parking garage. ""Deep Throat."" Do trench coats and sunglasses make them inconspicuous? They talk. ""They all look alike."" The documents? ""The dog ate it."" A black van follows the girls. Creepy? There is a telephone conversation. Is it fail-safe? A strange man meets Arlene at home. Later their home is burglarized. Clicks on their telephone line? ""I'm not a crook."" They run outside. A threat to National Security from stupid teenage girls? Can they find those tapes at the Haldeman house?

John Dean is a team player. ""We never met."" Can Arlene find an important reel of tape? [More comic scenes.] The tape has the goods on Dick. Their sources are ""embarrassing"". John Dean resigned. How high will it go? Did Nixon know? Woodward and Bernstein win a Pulitzer Prize. Dick hears Arlene's message. ""Maybe that's why he is so paranoid?"" The TV set tells of Nixon's resignation. ""They'll never lied to us again."" The song played while Nixon leaves is ""You're so vain"". When did these girls ever learn to sew a swimsuit from a flag? The ending messages are also funny. What is a ""roller disco""? What is more vain than a fashion fad?

If you remember history from forty years ago you'll find this screwball comedy funny. Its worth watching, but not all the scenes are equally funny. This film reminds you how the corporate media doesn't always tell the truth, like politicians. Or Hollywood movies.

Pakula's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, that means a lot of people I suppose, Fleming transplants an unconvincing story of two odd teenagers in the Watergate story.

As I said before, the adventures of Betsy and Arlene in the White House hallways are in my opinion not funny at all however the description of the life in the early seventies and the portraits of President Nixon and his staff are particularly successful. And the scenes involving Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein even quite hilarious. So, all in all, the movie manages to grab your interest and deserves at least a rental.

This movie is a must see for political junkies and fans of Saturday Night Live type humor. To me it's great if only to see Henry Kissinger explaining his Southeast Asia and Vietnam policy to two teenagers, and to see Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev singing a ""cookie"" fueled version of Hello Dolly in the Oval Office.
Another highlight is the pretty accurate, if visually assaulting, depiction of how people dressed in the early 1970s -- seen as some as ""the decade fashion forgot.""
You really do have to have been born at least in the 1960s to get some of the references, like ""Did somebody get their chocolate in your peanut butter?""

Frankly, they're not actually requirements.  I saw both of the other movies long after I had seen Dick many times, and we sort of ran out of time in high school history class in the 50's so we did 1955-1997 in about three days.  So it's not REQUIRED that you be a scholar of the Nixon era to enjoy this movie: but it is worth it to see at least ""All the President's Men"" first.
This is a brilliant, brilliant movie.  Hugely underrated.  The movie takes the events of Watergate and structures them around two dim-witted teenage girls (""I've known yams with more going on upstairs, sir"") who accidentaly stuble onto the Watergate burglars as they sneak down to the parking garage (putting duct tape over the self-locking door latch so that they can get back in without waking up Arlene's mom) to mail a letter to ""win a date with Bobby Sherman.""

Kirsten Dunst and Michell Williams show great comic talent here as two high school students who stumble on the secrets of the White House without knowing it.  To hush-up the embarrasing secrets, President Nixon (call me ""Dick,"" as Dan Hedaya goes) appoints them as the official dog walker of the White House after the five guys were arrested for breaking into Watergate, which only leads to more complications.
The comedy is funny especially when you remember how the scandal went on, and the original idea is brilliant.  But the film streches it beyond its limits, and the second half is a rather disappointing fare.  And some people would hate its ending, which should be alterd for a better one.  After all, the parody should be made about the object, which should be treated with a certain feeling of respect or affection.  (Do American people still hate him?)
There are good supports all around  -- see the two hilarious turns from ""Bob"" and ""Carl"" -- but the film belongs to the two leading ladies.  If you're their fans, do not miss.",1084579200,,1508,4.739463601532567

Andrew Fleming (who made a much better teen movie with 'The Craft') makes a big, unfunny joke of the Watergate scandal and President Nixon's massive corruption and anyone not familiar with the specifics (which just so happens to be the movie's target demographic) will be lost. Some older adults might get a lame chuckle at some of the flippant, throwaway humor but there is nought to recommend to anyone else.
Why on earth would these girls be so infatuated with Nixon anyway other than to drive along the tiresome story. Even Will Ferrell fails to amuse and has nothing left to do but overact in order to fill up some screen time (much like everything else he does).

(Arlene happens to live in the Watergate Hotel).  While the interaction between Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst (who never disappoints) is at the center of the movie and most of the laughs, the cast is an all-star ensemble cast of some of the funniest people in the business.  Dan Hedeya's Nixon is as good as any, SNL alum Ana Gasteyer as Rosemary Woods is both bizarre and hilarious.  Harry Shearer, Jim Breuer, and Saul Rubinek, while not featured heavily, all shine in their scenes as G. Gordon Liddy, John Dean, and Henry Kissenger, respectively.

1248493,4,B000021Y7C,"There are about three reasons to see this fairly enjoyable comedy. One is for the comedy itself. It is a whacky comedy based on the premise that the true identity of Watergate informant ""Deep Throat"" was actually two teenagers hired as White House dog-walkers! Such an outlandish premise occasionally produces something riotously funny, often something just stupid. This is a better-than-average example, closer to the former than to the latter. A second reason to see it is Dan Hedeya playing Nixon. Here's an actor that actually manages to resemble the one he is playing, much more than Anthony Hopkins did in NIXON. Hopkins is a talented actor, but I just don't think the right one to play Nixon. Despite the fact that we're comparing a farce with a serious movie here, Dan Hedeya's impression of that ill-fated chief executive is impressive enough that he might just be an all-too-overlooked possibility for portraying him in any kind of movie. The third main reason to see DICK is to see Kirsten Dunst the last time she looked like an angel. She showed the potential here to continue the promising career that her previous movie, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, should have launched. But instead after DICK she went on to the colossal misfire THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and then to the kind of ...teen ""comedy"" just serious enough to invite itself to be outdone by parodies, which it generally is. Too bad about Kirsten. We might hope she'll rise again, but meanwhile here's one of her more memorable lead roles to cherish.",1033689600,8,1509,4.875486381322958

What I also like about the movie are the cool 70's music (Blue Swede's version of ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" ""Love's Theme,"" and ""Lady Marmalade,"" among others) and Betsy and Arlene's idealistic liberal attitudes (which are in stark contrast to the attitudes of today's right-wing extremists).

1248495,5,B000021Y7C,"""Dick"" is a wonderfully wry movie. All of the previous reviews have been so thorough, so I feel that there's nothing really more to add...but...
I want to talk about one scene in the movie that struck me as especially poignant. Of all places, it's at the very end of the movie, when ""Tricky Dick"" is taking his last walk to the presidential helicopter.
If you watch actor Dan Hedya closely, you'll see that at one instant, his face suddenly sets: He thrusts his jaw out -  confidently, almost definantly. I found that to be most unexpected and captivating.
But, what really lodges this scene in my memory is what happens after the helicopter's in flight, and we're looking at Tricky Dick through the whirlybird's window. Carly Simon's song, ""You're So Vain"" plays in the background. (Perfect timing.) All of a sudden, Nixon (Hedya) grasps his face in his hand, the picture of defeat, rejection, and exasperation. He sags like a limp rag. The game's over. A powerful scene.
Funny thing is, this scene made me feel sorry for Nixon. Almost made him seem human (which he was). Maybe that's why it made an impact on me.
On a related point, I recently watched Oliver Stone's ""Nixon."" Here's another instance where the director actually made me feel pity for Nixon. I never realized what a desperately difficult childhood Nixon faced: poverty, a hard-[nosed] father, a religiously fanatical (dare I say crazy?) mother, and a brother who died before his time of tuberculosis, and whom Nixon ""replaced"".
Despite that, the overall impression Stone creates is that Nixon was a ..., and maybe he was. But that movie and ""Dick"" showed me a glimmer of Nixon's humanity. And, that was just a little of what made these two films memorable for me.",1026518400,2,1730,4.766666666666667

1248498,4,B000021Y7C,"Dick is an engaging and merry little satire about how President Richard M. Nixon got busted by the Watergate scandal. It failed at the box office. I think this is because the events took place before today's core movie audience was born. I think a sense of history is not something most kids are attracted to. I know I wasn't, and I was a fairly good student. While I did like some history involving folks who were long since dead, I was too busy dealing with what was happening at the moment then to care much about events that took place in my parents' time. The great thing about DVD is that it equalizes the audience age-wise, and perhaps an older crowd will discover Dick ...
Because the reporters' lips have been sealed for over two decades, writer and director Andrew Fleming decided that, since they never gave us the scoop, he was free to give us his ideas on who Deep Throat was. In Fleming's fertile imagination, there were two logical choices, both of which were teenage girls. In Fleming's slightly demented mind, they were named Betsy and Arlene [Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams]. The two were in an apartment at the Watergate, writing fan letters to a pop singer and minding their own business, when the break-in occurred. One of the culprits scared them to death in a hallway, and they didn't see him again until later when they were on a field trip to The White House. To throw them off the scent, they were appointed Nixon's official dog walkers and secret youth advisers. This worked until Nixon showed them his dark side.
Dunst and Williams are very funny as the clueless Betsy and Arlene. They live in that world of the now I wrote about at the start of this review. It's not that they are that dumb, although we are not looking at two future rocket scientists here. It's that they've had no reason to be worldly. All they relate to is that the once cool Nixon winds up being mean to them. The level they operate on is very simple. They know when they've been done right and when they've been done wrong. They are too simple to concoct a true conspiracy, but they have an instinct for righting things when they've been done wrong.
Dan Hedaya, one of those character actors you often admire but can't name, is wonderful as Nixon. He has the mannerisms down to every twitch of those bushy eyebrows. His interactions with the girls and with his staff are on target. As portrayed by Hedaya, he may be brilliant and he may be President, but there are times when he is as clusless as Betsy and Arlene. As Woodward and Bernstein, Will Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch are bizarre enough to make the real reporters turn ghostly white. I had a mental image of them talking about filing a suit against the movie studio, then deciding that that might make them reveal Deep Throat after all.
If there is a flaw in Dick, it's that it's a bit too middle-of-the-road to work as brilliant satire. Perhaps this is because today's thinking tends to include Nixon's great accomplishment as well as his low points. He's not the object of ridicule he was back then, and he shouldn't be. Still, in the Watergate affair, he represented everything you should not do if you plan to stay in power.

And ""Dick,"" directed by Andrew Fleming, is a satisfying and memorable film that unequivocally does NOT do any of those things.  Because it's too busy doing exactly what it was intended to do:  Make you laugh.  It's a hilarious comedy about the Nixon White House and the Watergate affair that finally answers the questions everyone has been asking since Nixon declared he wasn't a crook.  Like what really happened at the Watergate that night and who alerted the authorities about the break-in?  Who was ""Deep throat,"" and why did he use that name?  Where did Nixon come up with the idea to flash his famous ""Victory"" sign?  And what was really on that eighteen-and-a-half minutes of tape that got erased?
 Kirsten Dunst is Betsy Jobs, a normal, everyday teenager whose best friend, Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams), just happens to live at the Watergate.  One night at Arlene's place, the girls are frantically working to finish an essay for Arlene to enter in a ""Win a date with Bobby Sherman"" contest; this is important stuff-- Arlene just HAS to win, but her entry has to be in the mailbox by midnight.  They manage to finish in time and rush out to the mailbox, but as they're hurrying down the stairs and into the parking garage, they inadvertently do and then see something that ultimately-- and history buffs take note!-- has a significant impact on the Nixon administration, and consequently on the course of history.  But for Betsy and Arlene, it's only the beginning of their personal involvement with the leader of the free world.  And all this time later, who knew?
 What makes this movie so good is that it's clever without having to force itself on you; the humor is subtle without being too deep, which makes it accessible to just about everyone, as well as enjoyable.  You don't have to think too hard to get it, and it doesn't assault you with slapstick, silliness or the grossness that defines so many comedies involving teens today.  There's even a parody of Woodward and Bernstein (Will Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch) that works well, and though it's not among the film's most memorable moments, it is funny.
 What is memorable about this movie is Dunst and Williams, and especially Dan Hedaya, whose take on Richard Nixon is a dead-on riot.  He's got the body language and the mannerisms down pat, and it's a hoot.  And the girls are endearingly frivolous; they've got the looks, the attitude and the spirit of everything Teen, to which they bring a carefree depth to their perception of the world and their place in it, kind of like a younger version of Romy and Michele with the freshness of youth and their whole lives ahead of them.
 This is a comedy that will appeal to a wide audience and transcend demographics because it's a multi-generational, nonpartisan, funny film.  Teens will identify with Betsy and Arlene regardless of the context, and everyone else will be able to relate to the politics and the era on any number of levels.  What's important is that it's presented in a light-hearted way, without malice and with the sole purpose of giving you a good time and a lot of laughs (which it certainly does).  And it's good clean fun; parents can watch this one with the kids without any fear of embarrassment, and on the other hand, you can take your grandmother to see it, as well.
 The supporting cast includes Teri Garr (Helen Lorenzo), Dave Foley (Bob Haldeman), Jim Breuer (John Dean), Ana Gasteyer (Rose Mary Woods), Harry Shearer (G. Gordon Liddy), Saul Rubinek (doing a right-on Henry Kissinger), G.D. Spradlin (Ben Bradlee) and Devon Gummersall (Larry).  An uplifting movie with some bona fide laugh-out-loud moments, ""Dick"" gives a skewing to a serious event and time, but it does it with reverence, respect and good taste, and it emerges as something of a paean to eternal youth and the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of an ever-changing world.  In the end, this is a film that will make your heart light and put a smile on your face.  And that, without a doubt, is the magic of the movies.",995155200,14,4331,4.701986754966887

1248517,4,B000021Y7C,"Although almost completely ignored when it was released in 1999, DICK is one of the funniest films of the last decade. In many ways, the film is a cross between the classic 60s comedy THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT and (of all things) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but the result is completely original. Two self-absorbed teenagers in 1972 become involved (though all manner of coincidences) with the doings of the Nixon White House, and become key invisible players in the unravelling of the watergate scandal: indeed, they become collectively known to Woodward and Bernstein as the ""Deep Throat"" source.
Sometimes the best kind of comedy is the kind you can't describe. Why it should be funny that one of the girls should fall madly in love with President Nixon--removing all her Bobby Sherman posters on the wall in favor of pictures of him, and fantasizing he sweeps her away on horseback on a deserted beach (""What about Pat?"" ""She understands..."")--is almost impossible to explain, but hilarious it is nonetheless. Almost all of the humor in the film is to be found in the characters and the situations rather than in one-liners--signs of true comic minds at work.

The more you know about Watergate and the events leading up to Nixon's resignation, the more you will enjoy this film.

This was opening weekend for the film so i  was expecting SOMEONE to be there, but i was mistaken.  For the first time  in my life i was in the theatre completely alone.  Just me.  No one else.  I felt like i owned the place.  I laid back, put my feet up, munched on my  popcorn and laughed outlout to my little heart's content.  Granted, i  didn't completely understand everything that was taking place but i did  have a ground understanding of Watergate and Deep Throat and all that.  It  helps to be a bit of a brain when watching this movie because there are  very little things that can go right over your head if you don't know the  historical significance of it.  Overall, this movie was great!  My favorite  part of the movie is when Woodward and Bernstein strut in slo-mo down the  office hall amid cheers from their collegues (watch Bernstein do that flip  thing with his hair- it's a riot) If you aren't quite familiar with  Watergate don't forget to watch All the President's Men first as siad  before; it's a big help and a great movie; although alltogether different  than this one. It's a shame more people didn't dig this film because it's  so worth watching, it deserves five stars. Sitting in my seat all alone had  its perks- as the credits rolled and Abba's Dancing Queen played i merrily  danced down the aisle and sung along.  I felt silly but i was on Becky and  Darlene's side- they got that ""bad man"" out of the White House  and i felt like celebrating right along with them.

The acting, for the most part,  was very good, especially Dave Foley as a very believable and  well-portrayed Erlichman - a number of other Lorne Michaels-related actors  appear as well, including Ana Gasteyer, Will Ferrell, and Jim Bruer, who  were all good, but not noteworthy.

 But some of the  actors think they are funnier than they really are.

1248555,4,B000021Y7C,"One of the cleverest scenes in ""Forrest Gump"" involved Forrest gazing out of a Washington D.C. hotel room and calling the police to report some suspicious activity in a building across the street, thereby  inadvertently setting into motion a series of events which would end up  with the downfall of an American president. The makers of ""Dick"",  a new comedy timed to ""celebrate"" the 25-year anniversary of  Nixon's resignation, have expanded this concept to a full length feature  film, envisioning the mysterious Deep Throat as two blithely addled teenage  girls who manage to be at the root of each and every one of the major  events that would eventually make up the scandal known as  ""Watergate.""
The film, in fact, emerges as a clever,  lighthearted and likable mixture of ""Clueless"", ""All the  President's Men"" and ""The World of Henry Orient"". Our two  illustrious heroines sneak out one fateful night of the Watergate apartment  in which one of them lives to mail off a fan letter to '70's teen idol  Bobby Sherman at the exact same moment as Nixon's henchmen are burglarizing  the Democratic National Headquarters. Through a loopy series of absurd  misunderstandings, the girls eventually befriend Nixon himself, walking his  dog periodically and inadvertently supplying him and the entire white house  staff with marijuana-laced cookies. As the story progresses, these  befuddled youngsters, more interested in shopping than political drama,  come to learn of the many layers of deceit occurring right under their  noses and somehow blunder their way into exposing the greatest political  scandal in the history of the nation.
The film succeeds on three levels:  as a scathingly funny survey of the paraphenalia and mores of the 1970's,  as a witty takeoff on the scatterbrained nature of teenage girlhood, and,  most impressively, as a clever parody of the many characters who inhabited  the Nixon White House and the offices of the investigative Washington Post.  The most sharply drawn caricatures are Henry Kissinger, ludicrously  justifying his foreign policy decisions to two utterly uninformed and  uninterested young ladies, and Carl Bernstein, more concerned with his  blow-dried hair and not being ""scooped"" by Woodward than with the  gravity of the scandal they're uncovering. Though brilliantly portrayed,  the Nixon caricature is less effective. The main problem is that he comes  across as a rather likable buffoon, particularly in his affection for the  young ladies, so that, when he begins to utter anti-semitic and obviously  duplicitous statements, he seems to jump too far out of character. The  girls seem to be able to believe and accept this turnabout much more easily  than we can. Nevertheless, the high energy script and performances make  ""Dick"" a fun, albeit skewed, history lesson for both those who  lived through the events and those for whom the title has even more  sinister implications.
And you have got to like a film that has the  wisdom and good taste to have, as its closing credits, the greatest pop  tune of all time, Abba's ""Dancing Queen,"" playing in the  background as the girls roller skate their way around the Oval Office.  Perhaps, the locale of this last image foretells a future parody in the  offing of a far more recent presidential scandal!  We can but hope.",964396800,3,3321,5.125233644859813

1248573,3,B000021Y7C,"I think this is a very clever & funny political satire that has the courage to make fun of some previously sacred cows.  Since the mid-70's, the American government and news media has taken Watergate so seriously.  And people have made the Nixon Administration & Washington Post look  like brilliant foes who changed history forever.
""Dick"" makes  all these players look so silly and self absorbed, and I thought that was  ingenius.  At the center of the film are the naive but dangerous teenage  girls played by Kirsten Dunst & Michelle Williams.  It is brilliant how  these two seemingly insignificant characters are woven effortlessly into  scenes of historical importance. The girls fit right in and seem right at  home with Nixon, Kissinger, Woodward & Bernstien.  That's what's  amazing, this story is actually believable!
Some of the funniest scenes  come at the beginning of the film when Arlene & Betsy first meet the  President.  My favorite is when Kissinger & Haldeman start debating the  merits of the Vietnom War with the two girls.  Later on, the girls get to  make Woodward & Bernstien look like grandeous, self-righteous  prima-donnas many times.  Favorite scene, the ""if I count to  ten..."" parody.  Bernstien's face is priceless.
Lots of satires  these days don't work because they simply aren't believable.  The latest  political skits on Saturday Night Live are too unoriginal and the Clinton  jokes on Leno are too immature.  ""Dick"" reminds me of the great  social satires created by National Lampoon magazine and the Onion.  Very  clever, very funny & actually strangely educational.
The line at  the end says at all.  After Nixon's resignation the girls proclaim,  ""things will be different now... They'll never lie to us again.""",955324800,4,1753,5.07773851590106

Particularly funny were the Hello Dollies and their influence on  history.  The extras on the DVD, including the outtakes which emphasized  just how much fun the actors had with making the movie, and the running  commentary by the director and screenwriter, provide extra chuckles as well  as insights.  And to anyone who might complain about Nixon's portrayal in  this film, they never noticed that Woodward and Bernstein are given a  similar treatment.

This  President ended a terrible war in Indochina that his administration didn't  start, opened U.S. relations with China, and achieved peace with the USSR  in the Soviet Limitations Arms treaty during the Cold War, just to name a  few accomplishments.  The Watergate cover-up was an attempt to protect the  American people from a mistake but unfortunately failed.  Also, this film  was inaccurate in its portrayal of Nixon and his wife Pat.  Nixon cherished  nothing in this world besides Pat, not like our current President.  Why  won't these two girls make a sequel called ""Bill"".  Since they  would be older, they could become presidential secretaries that would  perform ""favors"" for the Bill like his infamous intern.  They  could help Ken Starr with his case.

The taped door, the erased  tape, the CREEP list... it's all there.
There's another aspect of the  film that I didn't become aware of until the second viewing -- the  ""coming of age"" story of the two 15-year-olds. Even though they  remain ditzy throughout, there is a definite maturation that progresses  through to the end of the movie. Their self-awareness steadily grows. For  example, consider the final shot of them in the credits (""Dancing  Queen"")...

The performances of everyone involved are top-notch with special  notice going to Dan Hedaya (Nixon dead-on)and Michelle Williams (watch her  shy expressions and mannerisms as she develops her crush on Nixon.

This inventive film gets points not only for its  hilarious treatment of an unconventional subject, but also for its great  performances, especially Will Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch's portrayal of  reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as two bumbling goofs. There's  slapstick humor for everybody, but you need to have a basic familiarity  with the Watergate scandal or at least seen ""All the President's  Men"" to appreciate the wit. My only complaint is the historical  inaccuracy of the music used in the film.

1248596,4,B000021Y7C,"I think one of the main reasons this movie worked so well for me is because I was about the age of Betsy's brother when Watergate happened.  Dunst and Williams are dead on accurate as two 15 year old girls in the early 70's, and the plot is very clever and imaginitive.
The rest of the  cast turns in at least fair performances with the exception of Bruce  McCullogh and Will Farrell who are absolutely awful as Woodward and  Bernstein.  I personally am not a fan of Farrell's but at the very least  they should have been playing their roles a little more straight and  without all the goofy schoolboy stuff.
My only other complaint was that  many of the 70's songs used in the movie were not in synch with the events.  For example, when Nixon (played by the always funny Dan Hedaya) makes an  announcement on TV that was supposed to take place in 1973, a song that was  not released until 1974 can be heard playing.  This may not bother most,  but I'm pretty up on the music of the era and distracted from my enjoyment  of this motion picture.
I won't spoil the ending, but it is funny and  extremely well-done (double entendre and all).
I am sorry that people that have little perspective of what life was like during the  Watergate scandal just won't get this movie.  If you remember those days or  really want to know what they were like, I recommend it highly.
Until  Bernstein or Woodward tells us who ""Deep Throat"" really was, the  explanation in Dick will do the trick!",948931200,4,1477,4.4200743494423795
1248597,1,B000021Y7C,"Me and my friends rented this movie even though we'd never heard of it.  All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent.  This movie was terrible.  I'm a fan of Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek  but she destroyed any credibility that she had by starring in this movie.  The movie was supposed to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny about  it.  We were so bored that we didn't even finish it.  We had to turn it off  it was too terrible to finish.  Whatever you do don't put yourself through  the torture of having to see this movie.",948758400,2,564,4.12962962962963

Like when Arlene is on the tape for 18 and  1/2 minutes,Dean quiting, ""Because I realize now, that if I stayed,  that I would be just as bad as he is"".  And Woodward and Berenstein  are hilarious, with their cat-fight at the beginning. If you didn't live  through the seventies , ask one your parents or teachers to fill you in ,  so you won't miss anything.  Then go watch Dick! P.S. The ending is the  best!",946944000,6,583,4.236363636363636

1248613,5,B000021Y7C,"I was a history/political science double major and did more than my fair share of research on Watergate and its aftermath, and a lot of debate speculating who ""Deep Throat"" really was/is. This movie  completely cracked me up--it's nice to see a movie about Watergate that  makes sense, but doesn't take itself too seriously.",946771200,5,324,4.981481481481482
1248614,5,B000021Y7C,"Granted, this movie will not win Oscars but that's really not the point. The intention was a funny spoof on a non-funny situation in American History...Mission Accomplished.  Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams shine  as ""Deep Throat"". Who Knew? The presidency brought down by young  girls (sound familiar?) Anyway, I found myself laughing for two hours which  is rare for me. Yes, it was stupid, and half way through I wondered if I  was losing my edge by enjoying it so much, but then I realized that was the  intention of the film. With a great supporting cast and an ""on the  edge of Disco"" soundtrack this movie succeeds where other  ""teen"" films have failed. It was fun and energetic and highly  original.  Don't analyze it to death, it's not American Beauty-GOOD  FILM! -Just enjoy it and laugh, cause that's really the point.",946598400,4,833,4.795774647887324

It is amazing to see that the producer of Armageddon sank all of her  earnings into this farce.  The movie is not only bad, but also annoying.  The only good thing about this experience is the fact that I purchased it  from another web store and only paid 16.99 vs. the 17.99 asked by  amazon.com",946252800,3,442,4.141176470588236

Perhaps only inside-the-beltway'ers might appreciate the spectacle of Woodward and Bernstein catfighting on a 'Larry  King'-type talk show; but much of what is hysterically funny in this film  is accessible even to to those who don't know Haldeman, Erlichman or Dean.

It's going to be a long haul  recovering its costs! It's difficult to understand for whom this movies is  targeted, but if I were to guess, 11 to 15 year old girls is probably not  far off. In which case I am the wrong person to give an objective opinion.  However, Dan Hedaya does an excellent parady of Anthony Hopkins' role as  Nixon, and his scenes offer some levity to a long 2 hours.",945734400,5,563,4.375
1248619,5,B000021Y7C,"I noticed that the reviews for the movie were all by adults. So I thought I'd do this review from through the eyes of a teenager. I just saw this for the first time about an hour ago and am now enjoying 'Teaching Mrs. Tingle'.  And I must say, I enjoyed the movie so much. Though I wasn't around during  Watergate, I found this movie interesting to watch, especially to see two  upcoming teenage stars playing bimbos caught up in something that they  can't comprehend. I found myself able to relate to their confusion at why  the President would do this, but in the end you know they are much smarter  than they were at the beginning. I also liked seeing Will Friel, who's  hilarious on 'SNL'. The best part was that it was wicked smart, the way it  so well tied in with the actual facts of the scandal. I also enjoyed it's  quite 90's type turn when they prank phone called them and named themselves  after a porno flick! So from a teenager, this movie is enjoyable from just  about anyone's point of view and it was disappointingly overlooked by  everyone.",945648000,,1058,4.424870466321243

7915169,3,B000021Y7C,"The 1970's clothing, dcor, and ""Groovy"" hippie culture were very well captured. Woodward and Bernstein played by Will Farrell and another actor whose name escapes me were amusing. Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams were bubbly teen BFFs that bust Nixon after coming across incriminating evidence whilst being dog walkers for Nixon's dog Checkers at the White House. Then they give said evidence of the Watergate Spying to the Washington Post under the fictitious name Deep Throat. This sets up the Nixon scandal and he tenders resignation so then Gerald Ford assumes office. Of course,  by now this infamous Nixon resignation is taught in textbooks and woven into our national tapestry. This is a semi amusing movie,but one I won't watch again.  This campy spoof is not laugh out loud funny, but parts are quite amusing.",1518393600,,821,5.074074074074074

To satisfy those that think ""people that like this movie"" do not know who the president is; you have to admit it was a toss-up. And maybe you are right I seem to have forgotten. Oh well at least I know who one president was due to this movie. And I really like the German guy.
