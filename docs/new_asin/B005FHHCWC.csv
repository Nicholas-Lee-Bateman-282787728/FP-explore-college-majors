4673783,5,B005FHHCWC,"I have tickets to see Al on September 28th and this video is not set to release until October 5. I have seen Al three times and I am looking forward to seeing him again in two weeks. My nine year old daughter loves Al and I cannot wait for her first Al concert, in two weeks. You did not think I could go without her did you?

I have the previous Al concert video and it is great. I have already ordered this one and hate that my daughter and I will have to wait a week after the concert before we can watch the concert on video.

In addition, if you buy the Weird AL deluxe edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alpocalypse-Deluxe-Version/dp/B004Y9CREK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alpocalypse (Deluxe Version)</a>&nbsp;you will get videos of every song but two, and those two videos are included on this DVD.

Anyway, Weird Al today, Weird Al tomorrow, Weird Al Forever!

****Update****

The concert was great. Al used some very funny ""blackout"" videos between numbers to allow for costume changes and stage setup. Note of these are included in the video, but all the nubmers from the concert are included with the exception of a non-parody version of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" that Al played during the encore and which let straight into ""Yoda."" The DVD is very high quality and the videos for ""perform this way"" and ""Polka Face"" are great. All in all a home run for Al. My daughter is the worlds biggest fan now.",1316217600,3,1457,4.858870967741935

4673812,5,B005FHHCWC,"What's not to love if you have been a lifelong fan of Weird Al.  I love the fact that he built up the ability to change words for popular songs and make them interesting, in a parody way.

4673816,5,B005FHHCWC,"I've seen Al a few times, also had the pleasure of interviewing him long time ago @ KVEC/NEWS TALK in SLO town California.
His concerts are great, the costume changes alone are worth the price of admission! The show opens with ""Polka Face"", not his best polka, but it's the latest one and it warms up the crowd! 4 of the next 5 songs are from his latest cd(Nirvana and another costume change wedged in between), I dig ""Skipper Dan"" & I LOVE CNR- everybody needs a little CNR Daily(you're lyrics are sick AL)-the medley mid way through the show cover 12 songs and he's dripping wet by the time that's done! The second half of the show has costume changes on every song, the guy is nuts....but his showmanship and his show is a pleasure to see, and is worth the money....BUY THIS DVD-it has music videos and additional songs too-thumbs up AL",1375574400,,839,4.454545454545454
4673817,5,B005FHHCWC,"I saw this show live when he hit my town but I did not have great seats. The video shows things that I did not see well live and refreshed my memory of the show wonderfully. If you are a fan, you'll like this.",1375142400,,209,3.772727272727273
4673818,5,B005FHHCWC,"There are two types of people:  those who love Weird Al, and those who live on Mars.  Al works so hard and gives so much during his concerts it's amazing.  This has a great selection of songs, great picture and sound, and is just a really fun time.  Don't hesitate to get it and pop it in for a great evening of entertainment.  When you see Weird Al live, he needs time to change costumes since he performs so many of his songs in costume.  In between, we watch segments of ""Al TV"" which are hilarious fake interviews with celebrities like Celine Dion and Eminem (absolutely hilarious!).  Those segments are not on this DVD, but you should do yourself a favor and check them out on You Tube, it's another side of Weird Al that further displays his great talent for comedy and parody!",1374278400,,783,4.395833333333333

4673822,5,B005FHHCWC,"I saw Al in Nashville two years after this video was done and the show was almost identical, but better in person. The DVD gives you the full experience though without the videos that play during his set and costume changes. The setlist is strong and the show moves quickly from song to song thanks to the editing. Al still gets the job done and entertains us all! He's still underrated 30 years later!",1370304000,,402,4.445945945945946
4673823,5,B005FHHCWC,"I have been a Weird Al fan since I was a teenager. Him and his band puts on some great shows and songs that perfectly fit the parodies and funny original work that they have come up with. It is great to see this legendary crew of Weird Al, John ""Bermuda"" Schwartz, Steve Jay, and Jim West rock your world with their awesome musical skills and visual displays. Buy this if you love this legendary band!",1368921600,,401,4.2894736842105265

4673828,5,B005FHHCWC,I reticent to ruin my appreciation of Al's video offerings with this live DVD. BUT I was really happy to find that the quality of performance and recording has increased my appreciation of the King of novelty music.  I really enjoyed this concert and the last piece is really not to be missed. 5 stars plus from me!,1359158400,,315,4.431034482758621
4673829,4,B005FHHCWC,"Al's second live dvd is a fun ride through his recent 'Alpocalypse Tour.' Includes songs from early in his career to a good dose from the latest cd. All the costume changes, audience interaction and crack musicianship from his long-time band is here. As someone who has seen him in concert multiple times, this is about as good as it gets. The only thing missing are the between song videos/ shorts that are played while the band is changing costumes, such as ' The History of Dirt.' I also wish they could have included his intro, which is always a montage of Al in various tv and movie appearances, but I suppose the licensing from those companies would be prohibitively difficult or expensive. Oh, well. The dvd also has a lot of extras, whether music videos (' Perform This Way'), other live songs ( 'Frank's 2000- inch TV)or Al's home movies. This is a good addition for the serious Al fan or a good intro for a casual one.",1358985600,,928,4.497041420118343

4673831,5,B005FHHCWC,"Saw Al's stop in Eugene Oregon this year for this tour.  There's a few extra songs on this DVD that he didn't perform, but the songs he did perform are here, and just like at the concert.

Once nice thing is that we don't have the 5 minute Al TV segments they'd use for costume changes on the DVD.  Other than that, it was just like I was at the concert again.",1348185600,,360,3.9722222222222223
4673832,3,B005FHHCWC,"It's not mentioned in the DVD spec listed on amazone but this bluray will NOT play on players outside the US region code (you get a region code message when you insert the disc). ie. it won't play on any player sold in Europe, and probably South America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. This is deeply dissapointing. I'm sure I'd love this concert if I could see it! Many blurays of concerts and things are intended for the world and aren't region encoded - it's a great shame that this is region coded.",1347321600,,505,4.382978723404255
4673833,5,B005FHHCWC,Weird Al Yankovic is a musical genius who keeps on giving the gift of joy. Look forward to more of the same fom this legend,1335657600,3,123,3.96
4673834,5,B005FHHCWC,"I had the pleasure of seeing ""Weird"" Al Yankovic when he was on ""The Alpocalypse Tour"" in 2011 and was wondering why he didn't have a dvd of this tour.  I'm glad he finally made one and it doesn't get any weirder than Al.  Although singing ""Canadian Idiot"" was concidered a compliment for the folks there in Canada, (which the concert was filmed), but that's what Yankovic does.  When he parody's your song, he's a fan and is paying you a compliment in his ""weird"" way.  If you are a fan then you will really like this show.  He not only does his major hits like ""Eat It"", and ""Fat"" but his new hit singles ""Party In The CIA"" and ""Perform This Way"", which he appears on stage in a peacock costume, poking fun at Gaga in a way. Each song has a costume change that goes with the theme of that song and it makes it a lot more fun to watch too. Special features are really hillarious to watch, especially his youtube videos and unseen concert footage. But if you are a Yankovic fan then you will really like this dvd!",1331424000,5,1013,4.227979274611399
4673835,2,B005FHHCWC,"...no really, I'm serious, I been listening and loving Weird Al for the last 3 decades and enjoy every single thing he has been envolved in...well, almost. I liked ""straight outta Linnwood/White n Nerdy album"" and his last work ""apocalypse"" was so-so. I have two issues with Al right now, and I say these in love. A) the last couple albums I'm feeling like Al is loosing his edge, his creativity. Now before you criticize, let me point out that EVERY album prior was a ""let it play"" kinda records...ya know the kind, where every track is good, and you can't stand to skip a single track. But with the Linnwood album, its not so, and ESPESIALLY the Apocalypse album, I could skip half the tracks altogether. There not funny, there not very catchy, just bland and in some cases anoying.
and B) my other complaint is, Al is starting to get dirty the last couple albums having suggestive lyrics in some of the songs. He used to be good clean family entertainment...whats happening to you, Al?
Now you may be wondering why I'm leaving these remarks ""here"". Its cuz I bought this bluray video, and it just confirmed all the above just the more. It wasn't nearly as entertaining as Al's previous live dvd released a few yrs back, AND Al is adding to the dirty lyrics on stage with suggestive gestures and dancing etc. At one point in this performance, he even goes into the audiance, stands up on a chair where a woman is sitting and begins to pelvic thrust in front of her face.
Whats happening to my man Al Yankovic?? I've loved this guy for his work and personality for so many yrs. I shared his works with my daughter who also has come to love his stuff. But now I'm ashamed to share Al's recent stuff including THIS bluray video. He used to be good clean fun for the whole family, now I can't even show this video to our kids. Its a shame.",1329091200,13,1837,4.405882352941177

4673838,5,B005FHHCWC,"My brother and I attended one of his Alpocalyse concerts this year as a birthday present to him.  We were two rows from the front, center stage.  It was a phenomenal experience.  This Blu-Ray helps both my bro and I relive that magical experience.  All of the songs on the Blu-Ray are the same ones that he sang live.

I had front row center seats last year and other than the spit, sweat and cup of Al's water, this is just as clear as being right there, but a better angle!  This Blu-Ray is the concert equivalent to the Alpocalypse album, but contains some older songs from previous albums as well.  If you have seen ""Weird Al"" live in concert, you know what to expect on this Blu-Ray.  Yes, Fat, Saga and Yoda on here too.  A disappointment however is that you will not get to see the video content that you would normally see between songs at a concert, such as ""Fun with dirt"" and the ever popular Al TV interviews.  So you will just have to go to a concert for that.",1325462400,,700,4.148148148148148

4673841,5,B005FHHCWC,"""'Weird Al' Yankovic Live! The Alpocalypse Tour,"" blu-ray is an unusual comedic show done in parody in regard to song and performance.  Sometimes, I know  what Mr. Yankovic is parodying, but other times, I have to think, ""what is he imitating and making of?"".  I recognize the melodies, but not the original songs.

There is an option to display all the lyrics to the songs on the featured concert.  The lyrics are well thought out and finely composed.  Some of the lyrics may be mildly offensive to a few people and the act is, occasionally, a little lewd, but within the limits of most people.  Some may not like the one scene where he dances suggestively in front of a lady. It has a Canadian Home Video Rating of PG (which is the same as a PG rating in the United States).  There is no foul language.  I found much of the show amusing and entertaining.

The show includes a large backscreen, showing cartoons and videos.

I especially like the ""Polka Face"" mash, ""Canadian Idiot"" which parodies Green Day's ""American Idiot,"" the ""Medley"" mix, and ""Amish Paradise"".  I would like to point out that Mr. Yankovic actually has a fine voice and that his acts are carefully crafted with skill and talent.

4673843,5,B005FHHCWC,"Caught his show when he was in town and this brought back all the hilarious antics he puts on. If you love his music, this is a must have. Al is a true performer. The dvd is a great Christmas gift for fans abroad. Buy it now!!!!",1320624000,,228,3.872340425531915
4673844,5,B005FHHCWC,"Watched this dvd a couple times already and enjoyed it quite a bit. I've seen many of his videos and have seen him in concert as well. Al is a very talented performer songwriter.  I highly recommend buying The Alpocalypse Tour dvd, and also his Poodle Hat and Running With Scissors cd's.",1320537600,,287,4.519230769230769

4673846,5,B005FHHCWC,"""Weird Al"" and his band are exceptional. The show is extremely funny (I highly recommend to see it live, if you have the chance), but Al and his band are superlative when it comes to music - impeccable and exceptional. This concert is sheer delight. (and the extras are hilarious, too!!)",1320364800,,287,4.647058823529412
4673847,5,B005FHHCWC,"A lot of people tend to underestimate Weird Al. While his parodies are massively popular due to him taking the parody to professional levels. But, he has always had great original songs on his albums as well. For a comedian, he really takes music seriously. In this day and age of Britney Spears and other artists that are supposedly more ""respected"" where half their shows or more are lip synched it's great to see someone put on a show that's both entertaining and high spirited, yet totally pure. His performances are just as good if not better than his non-comedic counterparts. His performance is well choreographed and high spirited and keeps everyone on their feet. He knows how to work an audience. Weird Al's Videos  have always been great. A work of art unto themselves. They never get tiresome on repeated viewings due to the fact that you seem to always find something new. And he puts that same level of quality towards his live performances. He's the best in his field, taking pride in his craft as so few artists today can claim. Sometimes you might find his parodies sounding better than their source material. I also have the Weird Al Live! dvd (I'd purchase it again if it ended up on blu ray) and that one is great to watch too. The extras are nice, a few added performances, two music videos (Polka Face and born this way) and some interesting youtube clips. (though it's nice to have, they are rather short, but they are interesting in a weird way) I'd love to have more extras. but that's the greedy side of me. It would have been great that instead of releasing the videos for the album on a seperate blu ray to include it here. I have the cd/dvd combo, and except for born this way and Polka face everything else is the same as the blu ray. But personally I think they should have combined the two seperate blu rays into one rather than seperate, the price is fair though, so it's not that big of a deal and not big enough of a deal to take this down any stars. I'd recommend this to everyone who loves a great concert film and who loves comedy or Weird Al. It's more or less something everyone in the family can enjoy (except for a scene involving Santa) and the inclusion of the Canadian Chapter of the 501st for the two Star Wars related songs for the finale is a nice touch. Weird Al isn't bad for your kids like current artists might be, but at the same time he's no Mister Rogers so there should be (and always should be in anything) a certain amount of parental guidance. Overally it's a highly enjoyable  performance. You'll love it as much as I did.",1320278400,,2582,4.433684210526316
4673848,4,B005FHHCWC,"I went to the 9/22 Grand Prairie, TX concert (about my fifth time to see Al).  Got the dvd yesterday.  Haven't come across the Al TV clips yet on the disk, but will be looking for them.  He did 2000"" TV last year, not this year for us.  I miss seeing One More Minute (a treasured song in my life), but, as always, Al puts on a great show.  We got the second drum solo--presented as an apology for technical difficulties.  Bring your camera (still, not video) if you go--plenty of photo ops.",1319068800,,490,4.21505376344086
4673849,5,B005FHHCWC,"Weird Al is at his absolute best here. I saw him in Idaho Falls, ID and was excited to get this Blu-ray disc to relive the concert. Frank's 2000 inch TV is the only song not included in the concert video that he performed there and it's a bit disappointing not having it included except as a bonus feature.
This is a highly professional looking production, unlike the last concert film, and the Blu-ray looks and sounds stunning. I was front row center and this is basically what I saw when I attended this tour. A must own for any Weird Al fan.",1318723200,,545,4.300970873786408
4673850,4,B005FHHCWC,"I saw Al in concert in Florida a few days ago and it was fantastic. However, I wasn't that pleased with this DVD.

I feel that I would have enjoyed it more if it had an 'in-the-audience' view. The close-ups were okay, but I wanted to feel like I was sitting right there (but at a high-enough level to not have anybody in the way, of course). I'd wanted to have seen the audience more and be enough rows back to get Al...the band...and the screens that were above and behind the stage all at the same time. Of course, when Al went into the audience, that would have been a time to follow him closer.

Frank's 2000-inch TV was played during the concert I saw, but it wasn't in this lineup. However, it is in an extra on the DVD. He doesn't do every tune in each concert but, for the most part, they are all identical.

A couple differences I recall from the concert:

- on the DVD, you'll see two effeminate guy-dancers during the ""Perform This Way"" number; they were not in the concert I was at

- I remember two moments when Al was presenting the drummer, John ""Bermuda"" Schwartz, with a drum solo. Each time, it was just a second or two of a 'tune' and it was funny to see him all proud of his achievement. It was silly and the audience was all ready for a big solo that never happened. This isn't on the DVD. UPDATE: it's in one of the extra live performances

I was really hoping that, with the DVD, it wouldn't just be one song after another. I saw a cut-down, one-hour version of the concert on Comedy Central. During the concert, there were a lot of costume changes throughout the performance. During those moments, there were great ""Al TV"" segments and other bits. For example, he had mock interviews with Robert Plant or Eminem and they were great. Also, there were silly parts from his ""UHF"" movie...other flicks (like from the first ""Naked Gun"" movie)...and mentions of him in various TV shows. To me, these were some of the best parts of the concert that had me cracking up and I was so disappointed they were not on the DVD. I wanted to see the full thing!

Ultimately, I liked seeing the concert on DVD, of course -- but it turned out that it was the stuff in between the songs that had a major impact on the enjoyment. It got me to laugh a lot, and the audience was cracking-up as well. This also built up anticipation for the next song.

This DVD loses a star for me. Al's great and it's good to have, but I recommend seeing this truly live for a better experience.",1318550400,32,2480,4.272921108742004
4673851,5,B005FHHCWC,"While his latest album isn't my favorite (largely due to my self-imposed ignorance of most of the bubblegum pop-tarts he's parodying) Al is still the man and brings a very entertaining show.  I was especially happy to see him play the accordion (and keytar!) on about half the songs in the setlist.  Seems like he only played it for a few tracks on the last (and also amazing) concert DVD.

I saw him live 4 times before I became a father (touring on 3D, Dare To Be Stupid, Off The Deep End and Running With Scissors) and look forward to taking my kids to his show next time he plays near us.",1317859200,5,592,4.267857142857143
4673852,4,B005FHHCWC,"I saw Weird Al in Denver on 9/20 and the show was great. This was the fourth time I have seen him live, and while each show has been magnificent, no two shows are identical. I watched the Comedy Central ""Alpocalypse"" special and it featured a few songs that he did not perform in Denver. He interacts with the audience and makes you part of the show (literally). My girlfriend was not familiar with his work beyond ""Eat It"" and ""Fat"", but she enjoyed the show and laughed out loud through ""CNR"". Weird Al is terribly under appreciated, and once you get it, you will be hooked for life!",1317859200,11,585,4.376146788990826
4673853,5,B005FHHCWC,"I SAW WEIRD AL. IT WAS A 2HR SHOW THAT COVERED HIS NEW CD & SPANNED HIS 30+ YEAR CAREER AS WELL. WEIRD AL HAS AMUSED AND DELIGHTED MY FAMILY SINCE MY KIDS WERE VERY YOUNG.

8469901,5,B005FHHCWC,"I've been a longtime fan of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, and despite having never attended one of his concerts (though I did get a chance to meet him at BotCon 2009), I've listened to and enjoyed almost all his music.  It's my hope to someday be able to attend one of his concerts, but until then the ""Alpocalypse Tour"" DVD is the closest I've come.  And even if I didn't get to see the Alpocalypse concert in person, it's still a treat to hear one of my favorite singers perform before a live audience, watch his antics, and appreciate him for the funny and brilliant person he is.

""Alpocalypse"" is a recording of Al's peformance in Toronto, Canada, and showcases both hits from his latest release at the time (""Alpocalypse,"" of course) and some of his classics from over the years -- allowing for recent releases such as ""Perform This Way,"" ""Skipper Dan,"" ""Polka Face,"" and ""Party in the CIA"" to be heard alongside treasured Al songs like ""Fat,"" ""Smells Like Nirvana,"" ""The Saga Begins,"" ""Amish Paradise,"" and ""White and Nerdy.""  At one point he meshes quite a few of his songs into a medley (including ""Eat It,"" ""Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Another Tattoo,"" ""Ode to a Superhero,"" ""I Want a New Duck,"" and ""My Bologna""), and there's even a little goofing around onstage between himself and the band -- what other musician is going to kill time during a concert by singing ""Frere Jacques""?

Watching Al in concert is actually a little tamer than I imagined it would be -- he doesn't bounce around on stage a lot, and the audience, while enthusiastic, is one of the calmest and most respectful I've ever seen in concert footage.  (I have to wonder if this is just typical of Canadian concert-goers or if Al fans tend to be not as insane as fans of other bands...)  It's still a ton of fun to watch, and Al's songs don't lose anything for being sung live instead of in a studio -- they don't sound the same, of course, but no song's going to sound identical to its studio recording when performed live.

In addition to the concert, this DVD includes snippets from Al's YouTube channel (the man is hilarious even when not performing for an audience) and sketches done for ""College Humor"" and other comedy shows.  There's also a few songs that, while performed in the concert, were cut from the recording for some reason, and have been restored as a deleted scene -- ""Frank's 2000-Inch TV,"" ""You Don't Love Me Anymore,"" and ""You Make Me.""  I have to wonder why these songs were cut -- perhaps they weren't deemed as popular as his new releases or some of his classics...

A must-watch for the ""Weird Al"" fan (an Al-coholic, as it were?), and a great release of a fantastic concert with plenty of extras for people who can't get enough of Al.",1505952000,,2744,4.579591836734694

8469903,5,B005FHHCWC,"We just saw Weird Al in his ""The Mandatory World Tour"" and had so much fun that I went on amazon to see what I could find to prolong the joy. This DVD of Weird Al's 2011 tour fits the bill. It doesn't have the recent hits of course, but a lot of the songs from the ""Alpocalypse Tour"" are oldies-but-goodies that are performed in his current show. Watching him jump into the audience on ""Wanna B UR Lovr"" is still hilarious today: ""My lips are registered weapons, Can I invade your personal space? You must have fallen from heaven, That would explain how you messed up your face.""

The concert on this DVD was filmed on July 18, 2011, at Massey Hall, Toronto Canada. And they didn't seem to mind when Weird Al sang ""Canadian Idiot"" to them. You get 16 songs, listed below, totaling 86 minutes.

Remember it's yain koh VICK, not yain koh VITCH
....""The Five-Haiku Interview"", from ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon""

** In ""Alpocalypse"", Weird Al says ""good night"" to the audience and he and his band walk off the darkened stage. After a long pause, he comes back out to perform two more songs. This is just what he did in ""The Mandatory World Tour"". And I watched as a couple people got up and LEFT after he said goodbye. I almost shouted after them, ""Come back you fools!""

Lots of fun!
