Each episode covers a different ecosystem on the African continent. The episodes discuss the environmental changes that have given rise to each species. I prefer looking at individual ecosystems on one continent rather than the ""flying around the world"" approach of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>. With that said, this documentary is much older than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;(first produced in the late 1980s), so it simply doesn't have the HD quality viewers are used to. Regardless, there are still some amazing scenes, such as sea lions sneaking up on gannets in the water and hippos fighting each other with bloody jaws. Also, the enhanced mode is actually informative and not too intrusive, mentioning interesting facts about the animals. Definitely worth checking out.",1249344000,4,1161,6.958904109589041
8215553,5,B000UX6O3Y,Purchased this as a gift for my parents and they LOVED watching this set. I saw most of them too and the photography is amazing.  If you're into nature you'll probably really enjoy this. And it makes a great gift. The narration is outstanding also.,1232928000,3,248,4.511111111111111
8215554,4,B000UX6O3Y,I didn't Watch these DVDs but I am sure it has valuable information. My problem is with the picture quality. Aspect ration of 3:4 usually comes with midiocre pictures especially for high quality projection system. Can anybody describe the picture quality?,1200441600,2,255,5.2439024390243905
