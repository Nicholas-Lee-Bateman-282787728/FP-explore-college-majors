3788035,5,B001T46TUG,"Britney had to have a lot of courage to let the cameras into her life in such an open forum.  They asked the questions, she was honest and thoughtful.  Whatever anyone says about this sweet American idol, she absolutely shows that despite the dubious decisions THAT WE CAN ALL MAKE she remains an amazing phenomenon.  She doesnt try to justify mistakes she has made, and also doesnt really ask for forgiveness for them, she has taken everything the world has thrown at her whether justified or not, and is clearly coming out the other side wiser and stronger than ever.

It is fantastic to see the team around her supporting her and helping her, and you also get to see just how tough her life is - we all want the same life but not all of us understand that the perfect life also has massive challenges we could never hope to understand, and which would buckle the majority of us just as easily, if not more so, than Britney.

Thank you Britney for allowing us in like this, and best wishes for a successful future, both in music and personally",1240876800,2,1045,4.450261780104712
3788036,5,B001T46TUG,"She's Britney Spears, arguably the world's most famous female pop star.  Her ups and downs have provided more fire for the tabloids than anyone in the past few years, and yet her success as a pop icon has remained solid since she hit the scene in 1998.  But Britney, in the end, isn't just a product - she's a person.  Deprived of her humanity and sanity by false accusations, intrusive acts by the public and lenses, as well as a simple lack of understanding (which she points out quite beautifully in a previously unreleased segment when she is allowed to drive her Mercedes in the country), the blonde bombshell comes off as a sad, sedated person in Britney: For the Record, her most intimate and in-depth documentary yet.  To her critics who feel she hasn't answered enough about her behavior I say this: It's NONE of your business.  Britney may be an uber-celebrity, but she deserves some privacy and the right to be able to keep some secrets from the prying public eye, which most of us never have to deal with.  For the Record offers up a heartbreaking look into the life of one of the world's most famous persons, allowing the public to finally see the real person beneath the facades.",1240099200,2,1193,4.577464788732394
3788037,5,B001T46TUG,"Finally Britney Spears' response to what was going on with her in the past years. I highly recommend this, I would like to call it ""documentary"", it has a lot of beautiful pictures and is really well made.
Go buy it!",1238025600,,216,4.2926829268292686
3788038,5,B001T46TUG,"When 'Britney: For the Record' premiered in the winter of 2008, the world got answers to one of the most infamous breakdowns in entertainment history.  Britney put herself out there and talked candidly about her tough years after her marriage broke-up, years that included shaving her head, stints in rehab, losing custody of her two sons, being drugged and taken advantage of by a manager who she thought had her best interest at heart and with two emergency trips to the psychiatric ward in the hospital, she finally got saved by her family who took the reigns and removed the bad influences from her life and helped her as she worked hard to rebuild the life that was torn apart.
This is no ordinary documentary, it's not a fluff piece and it's not 'pity me, I'm rich and famous and don't like it' piece either.  It's simply Britney, up close and personal as she talks about what happened in the past and how she's looking forward to a brighter future.  As she geared up for what would become the greatest comeback in history, Britney assures fans that while she isn't 100% recovered from her hell years, she is definitely on her way and in a much better place than she was.
This is a must have DVD for Britney fans and for entertainment fans in general.  It's important to see that while being rich and famous seems like it's euphoria, it comes with it, a lot of pain, stress and constant scrutiny.  It lets fans go past the tabloids and paparazzi and see the true Britney.",1236988800,46,1477,4.537593984962406
3788039,5,B001T46TUG,"I saw this live and am now pre-ording the DVD with added material.  I found it compelling and somewhat sad.  It shows the life of someone who seems to have it all, but every guy she's ever been with has sold her up the river.  I was most moved knowing she may never find a decent guy.  No decent guy would ever want to be involved in the Circus, Freak Show, or whatever one wants to call Britney's life.  I do love her music and performances, and that's why I'll always be a fan.",1236470400,5,479,4.053191489361702
3788040,5,B001T46TUG,"I watched this live and it's amazing.  Sad to see how she has to live her life, especially the paparazzi moments.  And let's be honest people, she looks AMAZING after having 2 kids.  Bottom line, she's a great entertainer and a hard a** worker.",1235606400,12,244,4.5
3788041,5,B001T46TUG,"It seemed for years that you didn't even have to be a tabloid addict to keep up with Britney Spears.  Her antics weren't just spread all over EVERY magazine cover, but even make it to the national nightly news!  You also don't have to be a genius to figure out that half the stuff in those magazines didn't seem quite right, though.  Finally Britney shows us a little look into what it's like to be the worlds most famous celebrity.  Some critics say that it doesn't really explain everything (Why exactly did she shave her head?? How did this guy take control of her life?) she touches on most of the highlights, but the poor girl's life is public enough - can we at least allow her to keep SOME secrets to herself?

You're probably a Britney fan if you're looking at this so I doubt I have to convince you that her music is awesome.  I highly recommend this DVD not just because it's important for fans, but it's definately a historical video that prompted one of the biggest comebacks of all time.

Get it!",1235347200,23,1009,4.39247311827957

3788046,4,B001T46TUG,Picked this up for my wife as she has been a Britney fan since JT in the early 2000's... Great disk and interview point of view gives you her side of the story - not just the tabloid's... she loves it so 4 stars!,1325548800,,212,3.840909090909091

3788050,3,B001T46TUG,"I was really looking forward to this doco - unfortunately it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The interviews with Britney are interesting: she's incredibly frank and comes across as a young woman who's been thrown into the deep end without really being prepared for what's going to happen. Sadly though, the pacing and editing make for a fairly slow doco that wouldn't really hold up to more than one viewing unless you are a completely obsessed fan (or someone doing a thesis on modern fame and it's perils.) For the casual fan I would probably recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Singles-Collection-Special-Edition-CD-DVD/dp/B002QR5XFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Singles Collection (Special Edition) (CD/DVD)</a>for the great pop promos and performances she gives.",1282348800,3,831,6.298245614035087
3788051,4,B001T46TUG,"FOR THE RECORD is an MTV documentry, recorded over the course of 60 days, starting 5th September 2008, the day before Britney attended the MTV Video Music Awards [She won 3 awards for work on her 'Blackout' album].

The documenty's main focus is in following Britney as she prepares for her sixth album; In the recording studio [she actually does have an agreeable voice without adding all the vocal effects. She's certainly no Mariah, but she is capable of out-singing a lot of other pop acts like Chezza or Katy Perry], selecting dancers for her music videos, shooting the music videos [for 'Womanizer' and 'Circus]' and making a live appearance at a Madonna concert.

While it interesting to see how a celebrity puts in their hours of work, almost everyone will watch this hoping for some insight on her devestating mental breakdown...

To her credit she does answer every question asked her [including head-shaving, Justin Timberlake and second husband Kevin Federline], most of her answers are vague, sometimes rambling and they don't really scratch below the surface of the chosen subject. I've watched the DVD a few times now, and can't decide if she's trying to protect the last bit of privacy she has left or if she is still lost.

Among the non-answers there are a few that are are clear and quite heartbreaking, like when she talks about living under the conservationship of her father: ""There's no excitement, there's no passion...I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even when you go to jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day.""

To be totally honest - being Britney Spears doesn't seem exciting, it seemsempty and sad: Her own house is always swarming with people, all of her 'friends' are people she works with or family members, she is followed everywhere by abusive paparazzi and her Dad even follows her to work.

The scene that sticks with me is about half-way through the documentry when Britney is at the 'Womanizer' video shoot; ""I'm angry, I'm really angry. I'm horribly angry"" she says, whilst everyone there laughs at her. She broadens her clearly fake grin and tiredly sighs ""I'm smiling right now because I think it's funny that you are all laughing"". Later her eyes well up as she tells the interviewer ""When I tell people how I'm feeling it's like they hear me, but they're not really listening. They hear what they want to hear"".

That really makes me question if she's making music again because she really feels ready to or if people around her are shoving her back into the limelight. All of the media's crazy stories and conspiracy theories about Britney being some sort of prisoner don't seem quite so insane now.

This isn't easy viewing, but is something I highly recommend owning; When you're next enviously eyeing up a celebrity's seemingly charmed life in a magazine, you'll consider this and then the lifestyle won't seem so great.",1280016000,7,2986,4.818359375
3788052,5,B001T46TUG,"A DVD that I have not stopped watching for over a year. Britney's life is complete chaos and you can tell she is just screaming for some sense of normalcy. The documentary is not uplifting but rather sad. And the sad thing is, with her popularity no matter what she is doing at the time, always continues to rise. She has the ""it"" factor and we are all majorly intrigued by this young woman. She may be in show business but no one deserves to be followed and written about the way Britney is. She has it FAR worse than any other human being and I wish for her to get her life and peace back soon before it's too late.",1276128000,,617,4.107438016528926
3788053,3,B001T46TUG,it was interesting but surprised how little time she spent with her sons. She needs to disappear and let her boys grow up with their mum away from the cameras like Demi Moore and Bruce Willis did with their kids.,1252713600,,212,4.325
3788054,3,B001T46TUG,"This was a different side of Britney Spears. This documentry was too short in my opinion it really didn't go too deep into anything that was going on with her. It gave just enough info, but not too much info.",1252454400,,208,4.225
3788055,3,B001T46TUG,"THis video was not what i thought it would be. It was actually quite boring. Some parts were interesting, but most of it was just dumb. She vaguely explains the answers that everyone has been wanting to hear over the past year. After watching this video, I really don't know why any of this crap still happened!! So i believe this was just a money making attempt. I love Britney, but this was a horrible video.",1243382400,2,410,4.407894736842105
3788056,5,B001T46TUG,"A very real depiction of her life after her troubled times...Britney is awesome in everyway..by opening up and being candid about all her troubles and how she overcame most of everything and is still trying really hard..

Britney fans will cry at some moments because she is very sad in parts of her interview with an interviewer from England and you really understand what she went through the last 3 years of her life...

I really respect her alot for putting all her personals on tape for everyone to see....takes alot of braveness..

A beautiful Britney at her worse and her best!!!",1243036800,3,586,4.7254901960784315
3788057,5,B001T46TUG,"This is a MUST have!! It is a true interview and you get to see what being one of the most famous superstars is like. It's very sad but it also opens everyone perspective and makes them understand her at least just a bit better, which is why she made it. It is a wonderful DVD that I do not get tired of watching even though it still makes me cry to know how sad she is living her life regardless of all the money she has. You really get to see a different side of her. A side that she has to hide in order to keep people happy, and that's nice to see because it shows that she is just like us. As a bonus, it also includes some bonus remixes of the songs Circus and Womanizer which I love. It's a must buy :)",1242259200,12,709,3.8299319727891157

3788060,5,B001T46TUG,"Being a Britney fan for almost 10 years, I was devasted to see some of the stuff that she had been through in these last 2 years. I loved this documentary because it helped us understand just a little bit of what she was going through as a person. Not as ""Britney Spears"", but as Britney. I really hope that one day she can find that peace within herself and gain the strength back that she once had. For those of you who love Britney, you will love this documentary.",1241308800,,467,4.2

8340440,4,B001T46TUG,"The documentary is great but the bonus features are minimal and disappointing. The remixes included are good, but are useless unless you put the disc in your computer.

Even without those, it would have been nice to have some extra footage or even the teaser trailers for the documentary included.",1475971200,,411,4.885714285714286
8340441,5,B001T46TUG,Britney: For the Record is a stunningly candid view into what it's like to be the Legend herself.

8340445,4,B001T46TUG,"I really liked this documentary on Britney.
Usually there are a lot of confusing flashbacks which screen for a millisecond then flash to another old pic.
The prime shot of Britney was taken in great lighting and very close up so that it was easier to read her impressions as well as listen to the down to earth narrative.

The doco not only describes how hard it is to gain success but also how you can be strangled by the same 'success' and the expression of her having only a space 4 feet by 4 feet to feel free in is apt.
This must apply to many of today's stars and they like Britney yearn for understanding and that life at the top can make you feel like you are being crushed.
