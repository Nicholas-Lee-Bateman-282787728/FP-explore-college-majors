475064,5,6302460247,"The Weavers are one of the all time great folk groups. This video chronicles a reunion late in their lives, culminating in a concert in Carnegie Hall.
The video captures the idealism of the 50's and 60's ,  and gives hope that some idealism lives on.  The rich voices of the Weavers  original recordings , as well as the delightful reunion efforts make this  an unforgettable experince to view.
I have watched this video many times  and always enjoy the classics such as Tzena Tzena, and If I Had a  Hammer.
I will always be greatful to my wonderful Mum who gave me the  video. I think you will find this a real treat.
Enjoy!!!",932169600,7,627,4.4

Wasn't That a Time tells the story of how the Weavers  gathered for their last concert in 1980 - for the first time in 17 years.  The emotional and enthusiastic response of the audience to the quartet and  the old as well as new tunes they played reflects their unique status in  the cultural and political history of the US.

475111,5,6302460247,"Fans of this film should be aware that as of March 22, 2011, PBS is selling (for a $90.00 donation) a DVD of the documentary, augmented with new interviews with the likes of Ronnie Gilbert, Pete Seeger, Fred Hellerman, Holly Near, Peter Yarrow,and Don McLean.

The film was released on VHS and laserdisc back in the 1980's, but has never been available on DVD before.  PBS has apparently acquired the rights and is offering the DVD in trade for a (tax deductible) donation.

I watched the beginning of the PBS telecast, and felt that the image color was stronger than I recall from the VHS cassette.  However, as soon as the fist pledge break occured, I stopped watching the telecast and ordered the new DVD!  I received the DVD in four weeks, which I gather is standard for PBS DVDs.

UPDATE: This PBS release went out of print and hasn't been offered again, to my knowledge.  That is a real tragedy.

I am very happy to finally have this superb film on DVD.  The color is somewhat lighter than the older VHS version, revealing more detail around the edges (it's easier to see the books and records in Lee Hays' living room).  The film is still just as inspiring and uplifting as it felt back in 1982.  It's also great to see that three of the Weavers are still with us!

I thought that Amazon fans of this marvelous documentary would want to know that the film is finally available on DVD!",1300838400,9,1391,4.476190476190476

475113,4,6302460247,"This review has been used for other work by The Weavers, including review of the PBS production, The 25th Anniversary Reunion of the group. That documentary gives greater detail to the points that I have made below and includes more on the genesis, early successes and the ultimate fates and health of the various members of the group.

Okay, let's have a show of hands. Who first heard learned the classic Lead Belly song ""Goodnight, Irene"" from his rendition of the song? Who from the group under review, The Weavers? Another try. How about ""If I Had A Hammer""? Or the old Underground Railroad song ""Follow The Drinking Gourd""?  I suspect that I would get the same answer. And that is to the good. Sure, we have heard all the songs in this collection before by various artist like Pete Seeger as an individual on ""Gunatanamera"",  Bob Dylan on ""House Of The Rising Sun"" , Tennessee Ernie Ford On ""Sixteen Tons"" or Woody Guthrie on ""This Land Is Your Land"" but we HEAR this music through the four distinctive voices of The Weavers. Thus the title of this entry- Making Joyful Music.

That said, this group morphed in the 1940's from a grouping, The Almanac Singers, led by Pete Seeger, with occasional assistance from Woody Guthrie that performed in New York City and other locales for the labor movement and other left-wing causes. The rise to eminence I believe, however, came with the addition of the lovely strong voice of Ronnie Gilbert that gives a very different feel to the music in contrast to the Almanac Singers. As a group The Weavers made their mark with a stirring, very popular rendition of the Lead Belly classic mentioned above, ""Goodnight, Irene"". Then the roof fell in. Between personal differences within the group and the pressure, extreme pressure, of the 1950's anti-communist witch hunt in America that looked for ""reds under every bed"" and that dragged Pete Seeger in its wake the group fell off the radar for a while (in Seeger's case a long while). Nevertheless this basic American folk music lives on in their voices and in this recording that sounds pretty good even today.

A few other songs from this collection also deserve note. The beautifully harmonic  (and wild) ""Wimoweh""; a nice version of ""On Top Of Old Smokey""; a well done version of the currently very apt and appropriate Yip Harburg song ""Brother Can You Spare A Dime""; and, as a finale ""So Long It's Been Good To Know You"". In the folk pantheon this group has a place of honor. Watch this DVD to find out why.",1233273600,2,2503,4.677272727272728

475115,5,6302460247,"I saw this on PBS years ago and it made me fall in love with the Weavers and their music.

475137,5,6302460247,"The Weavers, Wasn't That a Time, is a must for anybody who loves folk music.  It tells the story of the Blacklisting of the folk quartet the  Weavers.  PETE SEEGER, LEE HAYS, RONNIE GILBERT, and FRED HELLERMAN.  It also tells about how successful their first concert after the blacklist was at Carnegie Hall, on Christmas Eve 1955.  For years into the 60s, the Weavers disbanded and the artists went into their separate ways.  Seeger went to expand his solo career, Hays went into retirement on his farm, Gilbert started spending her time in the theatre, and Hellerman spent his time writing and producing.  Then on the Thanksgiving weekend of 1980, the events that this film was filmed for came to pass.  After 25 years, the four original Weavers returned to Carnegie Hall and gave two concerts.

I am so sorry to hear that this film has gone out of print.  My copy is kind of worn out and I really want to be able to own it on DVD.  I hope Warner Bros. will consider reissuing it.  You have my order if they ever do.",1170028800,6,1018,4.443243243243243

475141,5,6302460247,"I didn't know anything about The Weavers before seeing this documentary. But I was absolutely thrilled by their brilliant musical talents and their passion.  This tape shows them as they were in the early 80s attending a picnic together at Lee Hayes' house (he wasn't in great health) and then deciding to do one more Carnegie Hall performance (Pete Seeger's idea).  What I was mostly struck by was the amazing and vital Ronnie Gilbert.  As another reviewer mentioned here, her duet with Holly Near will give you goosebumps -- her passion, joy and love for life, all through the video, will inspire you long after you see this amazing story.  I also agree with the other reviewer who said they wished there was more archival footage.  But that's a small complaint.  I have to admit I shed many a tear while watching this video -- it was just so touching.",1082505600,17,854,4.66
475142,5,6302460247,"I grew up with the Weavers. They were my introduction to folk music. When I bought my first guitar theirs was the first music I taught myself to play.
In 1982 I learned that this film was playing a limited engagement at one Chicago movie house:the Biograph...of Dillinger fame. On a Sunday afternoon I sat in the darkened theater revisiting my childhood and feeling an intimacy with the performers who occupied a very special place in both my memory and my heart. At times I thought they were mine alone and other moments that the tears flowed with the realization that so important a part of life was over but not unreachable.
After the film,my date and I walked across the street to Fred Holstein's saloon where a hootnanny had been promised. Fred and Tom Paxton performed and the entire bar sang along into a 30 year time warp.it was magical.
If you know the Weaver's work,this film will take you on a trip down memory lane that will leave you both smiling and misty eyed.

The Weavers are interviewed together and individually about  the rocky roads they've traveled, and a good selection of visuals  complements the narration. This fascinating film could have used more  archival footage (there is one vintage-1952 clip of the group singing  ""Tzena Tzena Tzena""), but the new concert footage is just as  entertaining (especially ""Wimoweh"").

7826853,5,6302460247,"My recollection of The Weavers....

Growing up, one of my first memories of music on the radio was hearing songs by The Weavers. Their works distinctly ""stood out"" from all other recording artists of the time which made them significant. Of course, Joe McCarthy and cronies also made them stand out as being members of his unceasing victimization through his Communist Witch-hunts which cut across nearly every group, organization, or just individuals that he and his pals saw fit to ""name"" ""accuse"" and ""investigate"" which always seemed to end in ""Blacklisting"" or imprisonment, or worse as in the case of the Rosenbergs.

As I was only in kindergarten or first grade at this time, I totally did not understand what was happening, but I did wonder why The Weavers did not have any more songs except those ""already on records"" and that I didn't hear them on the radio anymore.

Times change, one's interests change, and you move on through new areas of growing and experiencing. Music changed. But, within that change, was a strong sweeping movement directly resulting from the Carnegie Hall concert that Harold Leventhal (their manager) arranged for them which drew Great Attention and Revival of Interest in their work. They individually had moved on, but from this concert young artists heard, took interest, and began to follow and take folk music to new directions and heights...The Kingston Trio, The Limelighters, Terry Gilkyson & his New Ryders, and perhaps greatest of all, Peter Paul & Mary picked up their mantle and made Folk Music one of the most lasting and popular forms/genres through to today...even though Mary has passed away and the men no longer sing together, through the everlasting quality of their work together, which keeps them ""alive"" in today's music world. Of course, Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and many others also ""came from The Weavers"" and Simon & Garfunkel continued ""it on"" through the Folk-Rock era. So, as you see, The Weavers (while having had a very short life-span together) planted the seeds for the younger generation to harvest and, renewing, ""carry it on"" through to even today.

There were other Carnegie Hall Revivals over the years for The Weavers, but they never got back together nor toured--yet interest in them and sales of their records never totally flagged (even today). They just ""were there"" in a great many people's record collections, always bringing warm memories and smiles of nostalgia when they would be taken out and played again.

This Documentary, first aired on PBS in 1981....

I have always watched PBS primarily since it first appeared on television...it just offered (to me) the most worthwhile and informative broadcasting. Luckily, I happened to catch the ""first broadcast"" of this Most Wonderful and Touching documentary about The Weavers, and knowing ""who they were"" I of course watched it. Although only 78 minutes long, it covers vast ground and gives a great ""picture"" of Pete Seeger/Ronnie Gilbert/Lee Hays/Fred Hellerman and their long-time associate Harold Leventhal through their ""glory years"" and those ""not so glory days"" and their eventual return through the Carnegie Hall Concerts over the years--and their ""disappearance"" as a group, although separately Pete and Ronnie still performed while Lee and Fred disappeared from sight and memory.

Then, Lee ""wondered"" and wrote to Ronnie about perhaps having a reunion, a picnic, at his place (as he could not easily get around without his legs, etc.) and she was enthusiastic and the others also agreed. So, the ""get-together"" happened over a weekend, and they naturally ""started singing their old songs together"" which led Pete to contact Harold Leventhal inquiring about perhaps ""one more Carnegie Hall Concert"" which he eagerly Did Arrange! They practiced, prepared, got Lee to New York and worked out the logistics of how would this work onstage with Lee in his ""chair"", etc., and it was announced! In 2 days the place was TOTALLY SOLD OUT (with people coming from All Across the USA!), and demand was fierce to ""hold more dates"". However, they decided that more than two performances would not be possible given the circumstances of Lee's health. This SOLD OUT experience in only 2 days was unheard of for somebody ""so long forgotten"" so to speak....yet, they WERE NOT forgotten, and dearly remembered by the elements of that crowd, they did do those 2 concerts and they were unbelievable, and luckily (parts of them) were recorded and are in this film. (I would like to assume that the entire concerts were filmed, but don't know why they would not have been released if they were....surely folks would buy them).

Historical glimpses, reflections, and conjecture about the whole McCarthyism business are here. Snippets of who they were and who they influenced, and mentored, what those people meant to them (particularly Arlo Guthrie, as Woody had sung with Pete et al in the Almanac Singers all those years before) and their honest judgement and assessment of their followers for their achievements and for keeping folk music alive, breathing new life into it, all are touching and meaningful.

Of course, for those who can actually remember The Weavers ""at the time"" this film will be a great entertaining and rather deeply moving and richly satisfying experience to watch again and again. However, prospective buyer, rest assured that it also stands on it's own even if you have only heard of The Weavers, or maybe even not so.....you will not be entertained, educated, pleased, and richly rewarded and fulfilled by the experience of watching this wonderful documentary opening the doors through direct contact and reflection with the members themselves showing you who they were, what they thought and stood for. You will not be disappointed with this film!

In Closing....

Luckily this all happened when it did as it did, as Lee Hays lived only a few weeks after these Carnegie Hall Concerts, so it is most fortunate that he wrote that letter to Ronnie Gilbert, ""wondering"". We are the Lucky Recipients of that letter's chain of events!

Further....

This DVD disc is taken from a VHS tape released some years ago, and long out of print. I have wanted a copy for at least 20 years or so, never locating one. I recently saw this listing here on Amazon, so quickly ordered it. The quality of the image is standard 1980's VHS, so don't expect HD at all. However, it is serviceable, and worth having in your library as a testament to this wonderful musical group who had such a profound effect on the future of music at that time. The sound is quite good, actually, and I have absolutely no reservations on that aspect of this ""recycling"" of the original. I DO heartily recommend it to you as it is, and with that will say only that I still hope for a remastering of the original and a new dvd or blu-ray release at some point in the future.",1410566400,5,6891,4.9404145077720205
