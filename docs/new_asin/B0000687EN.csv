Great recounting of the formative years of the Subaru Rally team and how it effected the growth of the Subaru Cult Following.",1223251200,,227,4.27906976744186
8464711,3,B0000687EN,"It begins good, but then theres too much talking, it realy haves some good footage, but again i expected to be 3 times better on the tips of these vehicle.",1175040000,,155,4.2
8464712,4,B0000687EN,"I thought this DVD was awesome!  I own a 98 Impreza myself, and this DVD had a lot of really neat information.  It could have had more though, and often shows the same shots over and over again.  But some of the in-car footage of rally and track days is awesome!  It was well worth the money in my opinion, but only if you truly love the Impreza!",1081900800,3,346,4.044117647058823
8464713,3,B0000687EN,"This being one of the most exciting cars of the past 10 years, one would expect a better production to befit the title. Its not really a comprehensive  ""story"" of the Impreza but a collection of interesting bits of video and examples of the car. Some ""talky"" interviews with Prodrive chiefs and engine mod specialists are of interest but overlong. The footage of the legendary 22B model are enticing. Enthusiasts will like it, as there is very little else by way of DVD choices, but those with a passing interest need not bother. I am glad I bought it, but I also love the car.",1036627200,17,577,4.495238095238095
