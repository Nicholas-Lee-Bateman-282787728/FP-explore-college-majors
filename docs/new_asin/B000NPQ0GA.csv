8180491,1,B000NPQ0GA,"I bought this out of morbid curiosity wanting to see if it was propaganda. It is like a film produced in 1950 Russia. The scenes are full of gloating reds  pushing each other to victory over the fascist beasts. Anyone who has studied Germany's, and indeed Europe's, struggle against Judaeo-Communism knows that Germany lacked ""super weapons"" in 1942 during Manstein's attempt to break the siege. Germany only had under gunned MkI, II, and III's to fight off the massive amount of T-34's. There were no Tiger tanks, and very few MkIV's. Germany was out-manned 10 to 1, due to the reds forcing every able bodied person into the fray, even dogs were made to carry bombs against German panzers. One thing we now know from the Hitler recording's with Mannerheim is that Hitler was very reluctant to attack the SU due to it's size, and from the book ""Ice Breaker"", we know that Germany's attack was a preemptive one as Stalin was planning on striking Europe. So take it as you want, but this movie is another attempt to portray the reds as brave, under gunned, out-manned, inferior in equipment, fighting the worlds strong ruthless enemy. The truth is the other way around.",1456185600,,1167,4.748768472906404

8180494,3,B000NPQ0GA,"I've seen a helluva lot of war movies, but THE HOT SNOW definitely gave me something different to chew on, presenting both a broad and extremely narrow view of history's most destructive conflict, and employing a literal ""cast of thousands"" to tell a tale of heroism, grim determination, and the importance of the individual in the face of huge historical events.

In terms of plot, THE HOT SNOW is about as straightforward as a bullet. It's December of 1942, and a Soviet anti-tank outfit has been charged with holding the line against a German attack intended to relieve their trapped army at Stalingrad. Because the fate of the war may hinge on repulsing the relief attack, the Soviet general in charge orders each of his soldiers to fight to the death where he stand -- there is to be no retreat. Correspondingly, after a series of tough fights against waves of oncoming German tanks, only one gun and its seven-man crew (actually six men and and one woman) survive. Freezing, cut off, surrounded by dead men, each member of the crew struggles to master their nerve and do their duty while staring, quite literally, down the barrels of German guns.

Although I've very little experience with Russian films (ALEXANDR NEVSKY and NINTH COMPANY are the only other two I've seen), in some ways I found this movie familiar, in that it's the classic story of a small unit thrown into the crucial sector of a huge battle -- a story told in movies as disparate as BATAAN, THE ALAMO, THE LOST BATTALION, and 300, just to name a few. On the other hand, I was fascinated by the differences between Russian/Soviet culture and, for example, that of Americans or other Westerners. Everybody knows the Russians have a reputation for toughness, stubbornness and ruthlessness, but even so, the cold-blooded behavior of General Bessanov made quite an impression on me. Early in the movie his HQ is strafed by German fighters; he tells the flying-control officer that the punishment for this ought to be death. A short while later he orders the summary execution of a drunken tanker who has retreated instead of fighting to the death. Later yet he waits to order a counterattack even though he knows it may mean the annihilation of an entire division, because the time is not yet right. One gets the idea that the Russians are at once primitive and almost savage folk, with their guitars and vodka and barbaric discipline and casual regard for life, yet at the same time deeply and fatalistically soulful, understanding that life is a rental and not a purchase, and that the cause they fight for is infinitely larger than themselves.

Technically the film is sound. The acting is very good, I enjoyed the script -- the translation seems very spot-on, with a lot of idioms -- and the cinematography was respectable and sometimes quite inspired. The sequences of the gun-crews clanking shells into the smoking breeches and firing round after round at the elephantine German panzers were superb. And being filmed in 1972, the producers couldn't fake battle sequences with CGI, they actually had to employ vast groups of extras and surprisingly large numbers of vehicles to get the job done. There is some model-work typical of the period, but for the most part if you see a tank, it's just that, not a blob of pixels. Of course the viewer already knows the ultimate outcome of the Stalingrad battle, so the tension lies in the fate of the individual characters. And here, to some extent, is the film's main weakness. Although several of the characters do get killed over the course of the movie, I felt that to some extent, the writer was not quite ruthless enough in doling out the scythe as the film went on. What's more, there is no precise point of climax in the story; just a lot of fighting which tapers off to a long, miserable night in a bunker followed by the battle's aftermath. An American writer would have structured the story more predictably, but also with a greater eye to tension and pacing.

I can't say THE HOT SNOW is a great war movie. There are a lot of characters to follow, probably too many stereotypes, and having been shot in the Soviet era, there is no mention of the tension which probably existed between the general and his chief commissar -- the two men come off more like brothers-in-law. Yet I can't say the movie didn't effect me or that I didn't enjoy it, and I will almost certainly watch it again. That's a pretty strong recommendation.",1408406400,8,4455,4.722365038560412
8180495,4,B000NPQ0GA,"A World War Two movie about a Soviet artillery battery that was tasked with preventing a German panzer corps from reaching Stalingrad to relieve General Paulus' 6th Army. They were successful but suffered great losses. The characters were interesting, humble, and easy to relate to.

8180497,4,B000NPQ0GA,A very good film about Russia in  WW2. It was interesting to see the war from the Russian point of view. Several of my friends have also enjoyed this movie.,1363737600,6,156,4.2
8180498,5,B000NPQ0GA,"An excellent Soviet era war movie that looks at the desperate Soviet defense of the Myshkova River crossing point during Manstein's ""Operation Winter Storm"" -- the attempt to break into the Stalingrad Pocket and bring relief to the German 6th Army in December 1942. The Myshkova was the only natural barrier between Manstein's 'jumping off point', Kotelnikovo, and the Pocket and its' defense was vital to Red Army plans to stop him in his (tank) tracks. That they did and the consequences is now well known by any student of this epic battle.

Excellent battle scenes, with a minimum of blood and gore, using what may well be genuine German heavy tanks, perhaps provided by one or several of the excellent tank museums in Russia. But perhaps they are just T-34 hulls with the clever addition of very realistic looking Tiger turrets etc.
The dialogue is not too gung-ho, not too anti-German or pro Party, not too 'For Stalin' etc etc, which I expected it might be, certainly no where near Hollywood (John Wayne) standards of the same era where under almost every bed there was a 'Red Commie' just sleeping while he/she awaited further instructions from Moscow.

A great movie for anyone interested in The Battle of Stalingrad and German attempts at relieving the 6th Army. This one looks at ""Operation Winter Storm"" from the viewpoint of a single anti-tank gun company and its component batteries.

Love interest is provided by the rather attractive nurse/medico attached to the company, who is very close to the front line --------- as indeed they were in The Red Army.

In short a good movie that was a surprise to me, an avid reader and viewer of anything to do with Stalingrad and the Eastern Front as a whole.",1299456000,18,1714,4.780405405405405
