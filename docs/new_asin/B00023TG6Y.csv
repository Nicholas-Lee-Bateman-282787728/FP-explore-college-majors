8021612,5,B00023TG6Y,"Great stories and nicely adapted to DVD from the books. My 3 year old loves them! Especially ""A TALE OF TWO CHICKENS""!!! She f watches this DVD for rest time.",1364860800,,158,4.3
8021613,5,B00023TG6Y,"These classic Robert McCloskey stories are mostly scans of the wonderful books that millions grew up reading, along with fine, understated narration....first released on VHS tapes decades ago, they are priceless. The DVD images are clear and sharp, with fine audio quality. My only quibble is the original VHS edition {by Wood Knapp Video} contained an extended excerpt from a fabulous documentary, ""Getting To Know Robert McCloskey"", which featured commentary and interviews with this great author. This is NOT included on the DVD.

Otherwise, a wonderful, older-styled video presentation for children of all ages.",1362009600,,615,5.542553191489362

Dear Sirs,
What a delightful surprise to find the McCloskey video available in DVD format!  It is my sister-in-law's granddaughter's favorite!  When they got a new TV there was no way to attach a VCR and everyone was very disappointed.  These are wonderful old stories, told as if one were reading a book.  Their family is all very happy with this gift--and your service was excellent.  Thank you.",1316822400,,430,4.743243243243243
8021615,3,B00023TG6Y,I thought this was a movie.  It's just screens of the pages from the books along with a narrator reading it.,1297814400,,108,4.142857142857143
8021616,5,B00023TG6Y,"Robert McCloskey is one of my favorite children's books writers.  I loved his books as a child and love them now.  I am a teachers and use them often in my ESOL classroom.  While they are children's books, they are a bit more complex than many kids books and I often use them with students who are understanding English at an intermediate level rather than a beginning level.  The illustrations are great and help quite a bit.  They stories are timeless and haven't really aged.  Kids enjoy them now as they did when he first wrote them.  Highly recommended.",1253232000,4,558,4.575757575757576
8021617,4,B00023TG6Y,"As with many Scholastic Books video adaptations, this is a fairly solid offering -- intelligent, well-produced and suitable for smaller children.

This DVD collection gathers video versions of several of Robert McCloskey's classic children's tales, notably ""Make Way For Ducklings"" and ""Blueberries For Sal,"" which were written in the 1940s and '50s, and adapted into short films in the late '60s.  The format is simple, but effective.  The films are not animated: the original text is read aloud (nicely, in resonant male voices) as a camera pans across the original artwork.  Although the production values are simple, they are well suited to the stories, and the overall effect is rather quaint, but not so much that modern kids won't still get a lot out of them.  Bonus material includes short adaptations of ""Lentil"" and ""Burt Dow, Deep Water Man.""  Wish they'd had time to do ""One Morning In Maine"" as well.",1180483200,,913,5.013245033112582
8021618,5,B00023TG6Y,What a great compilation! The books are terrific and to have them come to life on screen is magical for our children and us!,1099958400,3,124,4.208333333333333
