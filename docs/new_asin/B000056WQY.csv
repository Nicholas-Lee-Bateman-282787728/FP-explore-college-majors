1400858,3,B000056WQY,"Fairly soggy with enjoyable aspects. Has the feel of an initial effort by a smart and creative director who hasn't yet gotten his storytelling chops honed. Feels like the director loves con films enough to savor the details saying to his viewer ""but I don't have to tell you how that works..."" without quite having the panache to pull off the genre. John Hannah - charming but poorly directed. Famke Janssen is implausibly beautiful and not charasmatic enough to be paired believably with Hannah. Brian Conley as mob boss cliche stinks up the screen and Eddy Izzard is wasted in a ill-concieved bit part but still burns up the celluloid.
To fix this movie: Break the screen into four panes ala the DVD cover. Put Eddy izzard in one and let him do his act. Put John Hannah in a second and show him smoking a cigarette. Put Famke Janssen in a third alternately laughing fetchingly at Izzard and batting her eyes at Hannah. In the fourth panel run The Sting...",1035849600,14,957,4.60233918128655
1400859,5,B000056WQY,"I got such a kick out of this film, I really wasn't expecting it to be as great as it was!  It's light-hearted and quirky and it still managed to have me surprised at the end!  I loved the cast and I have/would reccomend it to anyone.",1035158400,2,234,3.9574468085106385
1400860,5,B000056WQY,"Famke Janssen is the most beautiful woman alive and she looks drop dead gorgeous as a blonde in this interesting movie. The annoying brother from ""The Mummy"" is also in it and he's kind of funny. But, buy this for Famke.",1020643200,,220,4.390243902439025
1400861,4,B000056WQY,"Poor Leo!  For him, life as a petty con-man is akin to walking a tightrope act.  His boss, Bruno, sees Leo as a liability and wants him ""rubbed out.""  Troy the loan shark wants Leo to pay up his gambling debts.  Julius, a geeky accountant, is blackmailing him for a murder that he himself hired Leo to do.  Bruno's brutal brother, Casper, just wants Leo dead for spite.  It seems the only person that Leo can trust is his sexy wife, Lily.  Or is she planning her own scam? And is Leo more in control of his life than we think?  There are many twists and turns in CIRCUS, one of those British caper films that keep the viewer hopping from the beginning. As always in these types of films, the casting is top-notch.  John Hannah is excellent as Leo, while Famke Janssen matches him with her sexy turn as Lily.  Eddie Izzard's unique charm is put to good use as the loan shark, Troy.  Amanda Donohoe is solid in the much-too-small part of Gloria, the woman Leo is hired to kill. Fred Ward is amusing as the American hitman who shares a past with Lily. The movie moves at a good clip, while jumping from one surprise in the plot to another. While the constant twists can be a little too cute for their own good, CIRCUS doesn't fail to grab your attention, if only for you to figure out just who is conning who.  This is a movie that I would definitely recommend.",1018137600,2,1358,4.2823529411764705
1400862,2,B000056WQY,"I have two things to say about John Hannah.
One: He should be in many many more films, because he is a fantastic and captivating actor.
Two: He shouldn't have wasted his time with this particular film.

1400863,5,B000056WQY,"A great story about the seemy side of Brighton.  Who is the best con man among con men?  Is it the pro (John Hannah), the gorgeous American wife (Famke Jannsen), or maybe the loan shark (Eddie Izzard in his best role yet)?  I love this movie.  It keeps you strapped in your chair trying to figure out who will finally come out on top, and it actually gives you a chance to root for the bad guy of your choice.  I love Eddie Izzard as the tune-butchering loan shark.  He makes the movie!  You have to see this!",1000684800,4,509,4.13265306122449
1400864,4,B000056WQY,"This film starts out a bit bizarre and keeps that tone just beneath the surface through out. If you are into artsy- make you think plots and whiplash endings in the style of Guy du MonPoissant this movie is definately for you. I particularly enjoyed the supporting performances of Eddie Izzard, and Tiny Liston.",994550400,,311,4.777777777777778
1400865,5,B000056WQY,"Con man Leo Garfield can't seem to get a break in life. Seems like everyone in the world is after him to settle a score in the movie ""Circus,"" one of the best capers I've ever seen in my life. There's so much going on at one time that confusion will set in, but don't give up on it, because everything comes together in the end of the film. The mysteries and attention-grabbers have a nice way of keeping our interest, while the husband-and-wife combo do more than just set up the plot twists.
To try and sum up the plot of the film would require a second viewing directly after the first, as well as reveal some of the shockers that come along with the story. But here's a simple taste: Leo and Lily are connected to just about every shady character known to man. There's Bruno, who seems to be in charge of everything that goes on, but may not be as in control as he thinks. There's Caspar, who tries everything he can think of to hold his enemies under his power.
Then there are the pawns in the mystery game: there's Elmo, whose past involvement with Lily brings him into town with a score to settle. We have Moose, whose loyalty to the person in charge is as shifty as a summer breeze. And then we have Julius, who ends up playing on the most important roles in connection with the main characters.
The first thing about this movie that must be made clear is that nothing is what it seems until the end. Trying to solve the mystery will get you nowhere, because once you think you have it, a scene will reveal one person's interaction with another character that completely tosses your theories and suspicions out the window. At times, it weaves such an intricate web...that you can't help but think that it can't possibly have a plausible outcome.
But you're wrong. The ending is not only the best of endings for a movie of this sort, but it remembers the previous actions and twists and binds them all together to make more sense to the viewer. Like any good suspense caper, upon seeing the climax, you'll recall earlier scenes that you once thought were obsolete or hard to follow, and they make sense.
The two main characters, Leo and Lily, are intriguing to watch interact with one another as well as other characters onscreen, mainly due to the superb acting of John Hannah and Famke Janssen. Hannah is able to possess a certain slyness to his character, and his thin form and way with wit fit the role perfectly. It's kind of ironic, in a way: the small, lightweight guy is able to defeat the burly, powerful men chasing him. Famke Janssen is a knockout as Lily, her sarcastic way with words and her...demeanor certainly fitting the role of femme fatale her character requires. The romance between these two characters is just right: believable while never becoming too banal or sappy, and never overpowering the story or taking away from its focus.
There are movies like ""The Cell"" which take us on visionary journeys into surrealistic realms, and then there are movies like ""Circus,"" a movie for those of us in the mood for a plausible mind trip. The logical outcome of the films many different plot twists is a satisfying climax, and the acting ability and suspense are all to boot. This is one of the best capers ever made! I loved this movie!",991008000,7,3259,4.506756756756757
1400866,4,B000056WQY,"If the like a movie with Twists and Treachery, Deception and Double Crosses, then ""Circus"" should be Right up your Alley.
John Hannah and Famke Janssen star as a Husband and Wife in Debt up to their Criminal Eyeballs. Their plans to become Debt Free, Decent Citizens are Marred by a Bunch of Shady Characters, including Peter Stormare as a Computer Hacker / Blackmailer, Fred Ward as a Bank Robber / Hit man, Brian Conley as a Casino Owner / Mob Boss, Tiny Lister Jr as a Henchman and Eddie Izzard as a Loanshark.
The Performances are Great all round, not One Actor Hogs the Screen or Bogs its down, but no one really Stands out neither. If I had to pick one performance that I liked best, I'd have to choose between Izzard and Conley. They both play their Tough guy Thug roles to a Tea. (excuse the lame ""tea"" pun)
""Circus"" has been promoted as another ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" Rip-off, but that is Misleading. It rarely shoots for Comedy, but when it Does, it hits the mark. It is Darker, more Mature, more Americanised and it has a more ""Film Noir"" feel.
Some may feel that the film gets Buried under a pile of Illogical Twists, and Dim-Witted Double crosses. Many Critics have said that, but I disagree. If you get into the story, and keep track of whose who, you'll most likely Enjoy yourself.",987724800,19,1311,4.466666666666667

7932787,4,B000056WQY,"Quite a good British gangster crime film, set in seedy Brighton Beach -- which, as I understand it, is kind of like the old Atlantic City, before the casinos came and ruined that place. (Bring back the charm of the old A.C.)  Complex, twisty plot -- yes. Many critics of this film complain of the too-complex plot twists. But, the myriad of plot twists IS the point of the film. That's why it's called ""Circus"", as in three-ring-circus. There's stuff going on simultaneously in all 3 rings, just as there is plot stuff going on simultaneously among all the gangsters to create double-, triple-, quadruple-crosses.

I particularly liked Peter Stormare as the creepy, unsophisticated, dorky but crooked CPA. But the entire cast was great.

SPOILER ALERT:
A few plot holes are not given final redress: 1) Leo (the main character/small-time but smart grifter) is shown as shot dead at one point -- but he reappears in perfect health. Obviously, there was a con going on, but it was not explained.
Similarly, his wife was shot dead, with blood pouring out, but this, too, was apparently a con. Again, it was not explained.
But, because these grifters were so good at conning people, it is not too big a stretch of the imagination to guess how they pulled it off. If it were any other film, I would be crying ""foul"". But, in this case, the con jobs are so intricate --like those Russian nesting dolls that open up to reveal smaller and smaller dolls. Because the whole film shows cons within cons within cons, you (the viewer)  can ""go with"" the plot, without feeling conned yourself.

This is a very under-rated film. It has many twists, but I did not find it too difficult to follow (which is a major feat in this film). So, my opinion is that the director and editor did an amazing job of bringing this complex ""circus"" to an understandable conclusion. The above-mentioned ""plot holes"" are not necessarily a bad thing in this case. By not showing the viewers everything, the film keeps its secrets locked up so the audience is kept off-guard. Had we known about the death-scene cons in advance, we would not have been surprised at the end of the film. But, I think a little explanation could have been thrown in after each death-scene con -- just to let the audience know that some thought had been put into these cons by Leo.",1456704000,,2323,4.628640776699029
7932788,4,B000056WQY,"CIRCUS (2000), is a movie that very few people in North America know
about, because of its British origin, and cast, which is unfortunate,
considering the quality, the story, and the sequence of events that
will have people's jaws dropping over 90 mins, with considerable
amusement, and some shock.

Once more, Famke Janssen reprises her ""eye-candy"" role as the token
hot girl, as was the case in Made or Rounders, for example.

The story deals with characters in the British underworld, For that
reason alone, it may turn off, scare off the majority of viewers who
think they'll have to hold their noses as they watch the silver
screen. Some may doubt of the entertainment value possible or feel
righteous in rejecting it on account of the theme. However, if that
were the case, how to explain the success of the Godfather, or Agatha
Cristie's movies, Perry Mason, etc. ?

Especially enjoyable, is the peppering of a sense of humor throught
the script is, as is the discerning taste in the music selected in
the proper moments, and the surprisingly good taste in the choice of
filming locations. e.g a famous seaside resort in the UK, a beach, a
garden party at a wealthy billionaire's estate, the numerous night
scenes skillfully filmed. All this is done so as to not depress the
viewer, or instill negativity notwithstanding the simultaneous
brutality of the characters throughout the first half of the movie.

Also appreciated, are the subtitles so as to better understand the
English accents and the widescreen release.

A head's up to some audiences, who may find objectionable behavior,
the cutting off of fingers, the eating a ear off a victim, brutality,
extorsion, grifting, horse races and cards gambling, the repeated
setting up of ""houses of mirrors"" by expert con men on their marks,
with even their cohorts not suspecting anything until they fall in
the traps, not to mention the overall unproductive lives that the
characters seem to be leading in this strange world of their own.

The director consciously decided as added spice, select vehicles,
Rolls Royce, Austin Mini, Mercedez Benz 80's vintage, Citroen from
the 70's, etc. The editing is also impeccable as the action is
non-stop, freely flowing coherently from one scene to the next until
the end.

With a mix of action outdoors, and indoors, and a successful human
touch present from start to finish, the script was crafted skillfully
enough to not allow the audience to mull over the insidious
underlying behaviors too closely.

However, what makes this story totally unrealistic, is that the law
is entirely absent. However, with only 90 mins, this is
understandable. Overall, CIRCUS is a clear winner, in all arenas of
evaluation, with the caveat, of course, that some may not stomach the
concept.",1270166400,,2775,4.9655172413793105
7932789,1,B000056WQY,"Good lighting and cinematography, otherwise smug and sophomoric script by Tarantino-geek clone, who fancies that drama is achieved through endless scenes of bullying and barnyard expletives.

Its key villain, Bruno, is several rungs below Cesar Romero's camp ""Joker"" caricature on the old BATMAN TV series.  (In voiceover commentary, the inept scriptwriter infers that audiences disliked the performance because they weren't hip enough to appreciate that Bruno is SUPPOSED to be an unlikeable sadistic egotist--as opposed to the likeable variety of such a goon.)

The Brit TV triumph HUSTLE and the 1970s classic THE STING outclass this puny busy-ness, not just because they had better budgets and were produced by competent filmmakers.  They had genuine wit, style, and characters (villains included) worth audience interest.

The commentary track lays the blame at the feet of the tween-brained screenwriter who, here, is ""Ed McMahoned"" by one of the film's fatuous, fawning producers.

7932790,3,B000056WQY,"Too many plot twists add up to not caring much about what happens to whom. The actors are all decent to good, the script has its moments, and all in all this could have been better, I guess...somehow.
Instead it's a mushy mess with no one to cheer for or care much about. It starts out rather ugly and violent but gets better as it becomes more character-driven. Even then, it's missing the snap and humor and pacing of Lock Stock and other successful films of the genre.

7932793,1,B000056WQY,"Many have described CIRCUS as being in the tradition of other British-gangster films, such as SNATCH and LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  If this is so, it is a tradition that not only has been lost and forgotten by the time CIRCUS started rolling its camera, it has been trampled upon as well by the time it hit the big screen.  While there were some entertaining moments in this film, I was completely bowled over with the ""amateur"" feel the film serves up right from the start.  As to be expected, there are a mess of twists and turns in the plot.  In fact, every five minutes finds us chasing down a new lead.  While some films can pull this off, CIRCUS falls beneath the weight of the maze it tries to weave.  The problem with a film that has too many twists is that you are sure halfway through the movie of how it will end: exactly as you thought at the beginning.  Thus, in the end, I was not surprised by the logic of CIRCUS, nor was I impressed by it.

While I will not completely sink this movie, I think that you can pick up many more that are ""in the tradition"" that not only do the tradition justice but also create something new and exciting.  You'll find none of that here.",1116979200,4,1195,4.252212389380531
7932794,3,B000056WQY,"In the tradition of Snatch and twisty caper British films everywhere, Rob Walker's film Circus finally flipped its way across my screen today.

With the delicious Josh Hannah, a cameo by the fabulous Eddie Izzard, and a whole heap of talented actors, I expected a bit more. The fault was with the story however, which twisted and turned itself right back to the obvious conclusion. I never doubted my theory on it from the beginning and I was right. It is a fun watch though and while some of the gags are tired- big man, small car- I enjoyed the basic plot. The characters are likeable, the story is fun, and its visually appealing. Definitely worth a watch.",1100908800,2,659,4.584745762711864
7932795,3,B000056WQY,"Crime boss asks a hitman to run a casino.  Everything's falling into place when we realize that there is much more to the story, a whole pageant of double-crossing, blackmailing, double-dealing and scamming going on behind the scenes. Far too complicated to care much about after a while.
Logan spews out twist after twist, but we soon realise what he's doing, and so none of his tricks have the ability to shock us. The plot has low credibility anyway, because most of the characters' secret schemes are dependent on coincidence, guesswork and oodles of luck.
What can I say. At least the film makes an attempt, and has ambition. It's better than the ads make it out to be, and if you really can't fight the urge to see a gangster film ""Circus"" is quite an alright feature. Oh, but it is NOWHERE near anything Guy Ritchie has ever lent his time to.",1080864000,3,849,4.549019607843137
