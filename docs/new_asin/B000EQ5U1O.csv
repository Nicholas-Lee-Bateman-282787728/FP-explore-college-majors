8113180,5,B000EQ5U1O,"This is a wonderful hindi movie with a great script. I was so surprised when I found out that this was an original script and not inspired by a hollywood film. But, then again that's the kind of films you can expect from Nagesh Kukunoor who is the director of this movie. He has created a niche of his own in the Indian film industry, which hitherto churned out only two kinds of movies, the mindless entertaining ones (with the songs and dancing) or the the serious stories which were not so entertaining to watch. Nagesh's movies are a class of its own, they are very entertaining and have a good tale to tell.",1187827200,6,612,4.37719298245614
8113181,4,B000EQ5U1O,"3 Walls: 7 out of 10: My first reaction was that Indian prisons are really nice. Honestly I went to a couple of sleep away camps in my youth and suffered more hardships than these prisoners. Sure the prison has sexual assault, loss of freedom and death but I am definitely sticking to my analogy.

This is my first real Bollywood film and since there are no musical numbers or dancing or romance I am under the impression that the film isn't typical. This is straight forward human drama with very good dialogue and a surprisingly twisted and adult story.

The film concerns three prisoners who are scheduled to hang. One is angry and proclaims his innocence, one refuses to accept guilt for his crime and the last is so racked with guilt he cannot wait for the noose to be drawn. Into their lives comes a female filmmaker with some baggage of her own.

The movie is about the four characters interactions and how justice is eventually done despite long odds and corruption. While you may have some Shawshank Redemption flashbacks during the film the movie really has its own story and feel. The acting is good across the board and the production values are excellent. This would be a well made film in any nation.",1169078400,6,1214,4.585253456221198
