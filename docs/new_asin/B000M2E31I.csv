2718214,5,B000M2E31I,"Warner's Errol Flynn Signature Collection, Vol. 2, features 5 Flynn films in 5 slim-case DVDs all in a box.  All the films run for the full length given on the IMDb, and all have good audio and video.  All contain the generous array of special features Warner usually includes on its DVDs; most of the DVDs have the full ""Warner Night at the Movies"" assemblage of newsreels, coming features, shorts, and cartoons.

At least two of the films (The Adventures of Don Juan and The Dawn Patrol) are available in other collections -- Don Juan in a TCM classic Flynn collection and Dawn Patrol in a TCM classic War films collection.  The special features attached to these two films here are exactly the same as those found in the editions just mentioned.

Three of the films I did not have in any other collection.  I bought the set for Charge of the Light Brigade, which I was unable to find separately.  It turned out that not only Charge of the Light Brigade but also Gentleman Jim are superb films, and those two films alone would justify buying the whole set.

Reviewers of this set generally seem to have a low opinion of Dive Bomber, the remaining film in the set.  They seem to regard it as a thinly disguised documentary, without much of a story, and mainly as a period patriotic piece.  I disagree.  Dive Bomber is a very good movie.  It's also a long movie -- over two hours -- but I did not find that it dragged.  The color photography is luscious, and the real WW II aircraft carriers and planes in formation are a joy to watch -- and I'm not one much given to either war movies or technical stuff.  But there's more to the film than beautiful photography and historical accuracy.  The story is a perfectly good motion picture drama in its own right, not merely a thin thread on which to hang some pictures of planes and patriotic statements about US wartime readiness.  Errol Flynn has one of his most sensitive and thoughtful roles as a Navy air force surgeon and medical researcher, and Fred MacMurray is very good as the leader of the fighter squadron with a deep resentment of Flynn, whom he holds responsible for the death of his friend on the operating table.  The supporting cast is excellent: Alexis Smith, Robert Armstrong, Regis Toomey, Allen Jenkins, and Ralph Bellamy -- with Bellamy playing the best role I've ever seen him in.  (This time he is not the hopeless sap of romantic comedies who doesn't get the girl, but a serious surgeon and researcher, and you believe him in the role.)  There is also a small role for a young Craig Stevens, later to go on to Peter Gunn fame.

There aren't enough superlatives for the production values of Charge of the Light Brigade -- a masterfully made black and white film in a beautiful print, running the full 115 minutes.  And again, Flynn plays a meaty role -- he is no mere flippant, breezy, devil-may-care character, but a serious army officer with deep principles.  (He has a similar role in Dawn Patrol, another black and white film in the collection.)

Gentleman Jim is funny, romantic, and at points touching.  Flynn plays a cocky young Irishman with a natural gift for fighting, who works his way up to a title match with the great John L. Sullivan.  From the film's description alone, I would have thought, ""Just another boxing picture"" -- but no -- it has many original wrinkles and it's a very fresh, lively film, not formulaic at all.  (None of the usual stuff about organized crime rigging the bouts and the moral conflict of the hero who's asked to take a dive, etc.)  Alexis Smith, in her second film with Flynn, is strong and a great match for the somewhat swell-headed character played by Flynn.  The supporting cast is great here as well, with Ward Bond, usually a bit player, turning in maybe his greatest role as John L. Sullivan.

It has been a while since I watched Don Juan, the other Technicolor film in the collection.  It is probably Flynn's last swashbuckler.  My recollection is that it did not live up to the others in action -- Flynn was a much older man in 1948 than in his Captain Blood and Robin Hood days -- but was still a fairly entertaining film.

This set has three must-sees -- Light Brigade, Gentleman Jim, and Dawn Patrol, and two other ""worth seeings"" -- Dive Bomber and Don Juan.  It shows a good range of Flynn's roles, and if you can get it for a reasonable price, and if you've seen none of these films before, buy it!  You are in for some of the finest film moments of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1448496000,2,4505,4.5073891625615765
2718215,1,B000M2E31I,"This review only concerns the playability of the disks in this set, not the quality of the movies. For the record, I bought my copy, presumably factory-sealed, from the mail order dealer, Edward R Hamilton Bookseller.

Not one of the 5 disks in the set played successfully from start to finish!

The following disks: ""The Adventures of Don Juan"", ""Dawn Patrol"", and ""Gentleman Jim"" all had the same problem. When I'd insert the disk into my player, the screen would go black and never display the Main Menu. After about a half minute, a message saying disk error would appear on the screen and the disk would be ejected from the player.

And I didn't have much better luck with the 2 remaining disks. ""Dive Bomber"" froze at 58:38 and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade froze at 1:09:05.""

Before submitting this review, I took them over to a friend who has a different brand of DVD player, and I was able to reproduce the same problems on his player. So that rules out the possibility that the problem is with my machine. I guess I'll have to hold on to my videotapes of these movies. At least, they play!

The moral is: DON'T ASSUME, WHEN YOU BUY A DVD, THAT IT WILL PLAY OKAY, JUST BECAUSE IT IS FACTORY-SEALED!

I've bought enough DVDs that have had problems to realize that quality control in the DVD industry is quite abysmal. If you purchase a large DVD set and don't have time to view it in its entirety before the return policy expires, I suggest you do the following:

(1) Put each disk in your player to see if you can get to the Main Menu.

(2) If step 1 is successful, then press PLAY. And then switch to a Fast Forward speed. If you get to the end of the movie without the disk freezing up or pixillating, then the odds are pretty good that the disk will play okay. Step 2 is not 100% perfect and won't catch every problem,, but it's the best thing I know of other than playing the disks at normal speed all the way through. At least, you won't have wasted your time watching a movie only to have it freeze up after an hour or so. I generally go through this procedure the first time I watch any DVD. I don't like wasting my time either. If you return a DVD for another copy, you'll have to sit through the same part of the movie up to the error point all over again. I shouldn't have to do Warner Brothers' quality control for them!",1446681600,2,2344,4.299319727891157

2718233,5,B000M2E31I,"Errol Flynn was a Warner Brothers favorite for years during the 1940's and 1950's. During his day he was considered by many to be the best looking leading man in Hollywood (although Clark Gable and Tyrone Power had their advocates, too).

Flynn was invariably cast a dashing hero of one sort or another (Robin Hood, the leader of the Light Brigade, a World War I pilot in Dawn Patrol).  I greatly enjoyed his movies when they first came out.  I bought the collection of his work  because I thought  I would enjoy watching them again; and indeed, I've enjoyed the two films that I've watched so far (or, more precisely, re-watched).  Eventually, I will have viewed the entire collection.  In an odd sort of way, seeing Flynn after all these years is a bit like seeing an old friend again.

Despite the dated nature of the films - black and white, not technicolor, no special effects, no spectacular car crashes, no extremely complicated plots - to me the films are still quite entertaining.  Some will enjoy the films; some will have no interest in going that far back into the entertainment past.  Bottom line:  A very worthwhile buy for some people.",1393804800,,1150,4.6716417910447765
2718234,5,B000M2E31I,"The Dawn Patrol is one of the best WWI movies ever made about RAF flyers.  Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are superb in their roles as tormented flight commanders, and there's nice dogfight footage too. The Charge of the Light Brigade is Flynn in one of his noblest roles, as a self sacrificing soldier in both India and in the Crimean War.  The history is fanciful, but it's a great movie all the same.  Both can be watched many times with undiminished enjoyment.  Those were my two favorites from this collection and the reason I bought it.  I was mostly pleased with the other 3 movies too. Although I didn't care for the seedy character of Gentleman Jim, it was okay as a movie.  Dive Bomber is interesting, because of the subject matter and because Flynn actually gets to show some character development in this role.  Don Juan was my least favorite movie in the collection.  It's very colorful and well filmed, but it was late in Flynn's career and makes fun of his persona, rather than being a truly good movie.",1380844800,,1018,4.554945054945055

2718246,4,B000M2E31I,"These Errol Flynn movies were a ""round out"" purchase for free shipping.

I do enjoy older B&W, especially non colourized versions.

Although these movies are old the acting is generally surprisingly good even if principally the same support cast appears across most of the titles.

The quality is surprising, if they weren't remastered the producers got hold of almost pristine original prints.

The quality of the sets is high end hollywood for the periods in which they were set with the possible exception of ""dive bomber"" which is stellar for its period.

Without giving too much away all the movies are watchable at least once, a couple much more than once. I'd have much prefered a ""swasbuckler"" to ""Dive Bomber"" - I thought, at least until I watched it. I was exceedingly, and pleasantly surprised by that title. It just wasn't the ""ra-ra, blood and guts macho"" that I was expecting, it was thoughtfull, innovative and investigative - especially considering the era it sprang from.

""Dive Bomber"" is the end of a period covered here that began with ""Dawn Patrol"", produced when ""talkies"" were still a wonder and the cinema pianist still plied her trade.

These are certainly some of the better pictures produced in a golden era of Hollywood, enjoy them as I think you will.",1324252800,5,1280,4.870967741935484

2718248,4,B000M2E31I,"This second Signature Collection of Errol Flynn may lack some of the grandness of Volume One but it's one hell of a package just the same. The ""extras"" are so-so compared with the first volume but the choice of films make it a must-have item.
Pride of place has to go to ""The Charge of the Light Brigade""(1936). Historians may quibble at its lack of historical accuracy but this is a great piece of picture-making and one of Flynn's best bits of derring-do. The charge itself comes thundering at you across seven decades of changing fashions and advancing tenchnologies to claim its place as one of the very best action sequences of all time.

Then there are two excellent aviation pictures. ""The Dawn Patrol""(1938)in which Flynn gives one of his best dramatic performances as a devil-may-care World War One pilot who suddenly finds himself trapped with the responsibilities of command. ""Dive Bomber"" (1941)was shot( in beautiful Technicolor) just months ahead of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one gets the very real feeling of a nation preparing for imminent war. ""Dive Bomber"" is an odd title since not a single bomb is dropped throughout its 132 minutes running time. Flynn plays a Flight Surgeon who is trying to find a cure for pilot blackout during steep dives and the procedures are really quite interesting.  It's an engrossing film that would be much better without the silly tacked-on comedy bits. The flying sequences,however, are breathtaking and Flynnis supported by a fine cast including Fred MacMurray, Ralph Bellamy and a gorgeuous young Alexis Smith in her first film.

Miss Smith pops up again as Errol's co-star in ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942) the stor of the 19th century boxer, James J. Corbett who took the world heavyweight title from John L. Sullivan. As a boxing drama it's light years away from ""Raging Bull"" or even ""Rocky"" but it does give a vivid picture of 19th century boxing as well as the social climate of the period in San Francisco.  Corbett is portrayed as an audacious and somewhat conceited social climber who cons his way into society through his boxing skills. Were it not for Flynn's winning charm the character would be unbearable.  The fight scenes, for the most part, are very well staged and Flynn looks good in the ring. The film's only flaw is that it's played a little too much for laughs - although there is one beautifully-handled scene at the end between the defeated Sullivan ( an excellent Ward Bond) and Corbett that rings true to the spirit of good sportsmanship.  On the whole, this is a vastly entertaining film and was said to be Flynn's favorite role.

Finally comes ""The Adventures of Don Juan"" (1948), the only swashbuckler in the set with its stunning sets and dazzling costumes all sumptiously shot in 3-strip Technicolor and a sweeping score by Max Steiner, it's a feast for both the eye and the ear.  The script,too, is fine with some really choice dialogue. Flynn's performance as a jaded and aging Don Juan gets more interesting as the film progresses. Is it an enjoyable film ?  Yes, but the only let-down is Vincent Sherman's snail-paced direction and his lack of flair in handling the action scenes.
Sherman was a fine director of modern dramas, but he seems out of his depth with this kind of film. If it had been directed by Michael Curtiz or Raoul Walsh, it would have been a masterpiece. As it is, it's still a good picture and sits very comfortably into this enjoyable and highly recommended collection of one of Hollywood's most popular stars.",1284076800,2,3524,4.801980198019802

I have read his life story, so I know what a rogue he was, but for all that crazy lifestyle. he nevertheless played his roles in the movies very credibly, so handsomely in those period costumes that made him look all the more delicious!  There has not been another actor in Hollywood, or any other country cranking out movies,  that can compare  to Errol Flynn.  He stood alone and unequaled.

Flynn himself may have been disappointed that the collection didn't contain more of his latter-year dramatic work, for which he received his best reviews, but marketers may be reserving those for a third collection.  If a third collection is planned, I hope that, besides his best dramatic moments, it will include films representing Flynn's comedic and musical talents, which were considerable, although virtually untapped at Warner Brothers.  How ironic it would be if such a third set did eventually appear; it would be proof indeed that the broad range of his work was appreciated at last, and maybe then that secretly sensitive soul of his could rest in peace.",1217721600,2,795,5.147286821705427

""Flyboys"" was a good action movie, but because ""Dawn Patrol"" is in black and white, it seems more real.  Flynn and co star David Niven are a terrific team.  Flynn is ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett, the second heavyweight boxing champion, who defeated the invincible John L. Sullivan.  If you want to see the life of Gentleman Jim, in contrast to the great John L., this is a movie you will enjoy.  If you like old time movies and want to get away from today's overpaid, over rated prima donnas, this set is for you.  If you'll recall, Flynn also plays George Armstrong Custer in another of his movies, I believe it is ""They Died With Their Boots On,"" and he does an excellent job as the Civil War Cavalry general and later the Cavalry lieutenant colonel who died at Little Big Horn.

2718256,5,B000M2E31I,"When I picked up the second volume of the Errol Flynn Signature Collection, I wasn't sure what I was going to get.  After all, the first volume had most of his really big movies (including Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk) and his definitive movie, The Adventures of Robin Hood, was not in either set.  Nevertheless, this second set does have some good movies, even if they are not quite the caliber of Volume 1.

The first movie (chronologically speaking) is The Charge of the Light Brigade, a depiction of the Crimean War with Flynn as a British lancer who will eventually lead the famous charge.  This is a Warner Brothers classic, with many familiar names from other Flynn movies, including Olivia de Havilland (his most frequent leading lady, this time playing a woman in love with Flynn's brother), Donald Crisp, musical scorer Max Steiner and director Michael Curtiz.  This also has David Niven and Nigel Bruce (later famous as Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes movies).

Niven is also in The Dawn Patrol which has he and Flynn as pilots during World War I, an era when aerial combat was (pardon the pun) just getting off the ground.  Both are cocky aces who survive while their less seasoned fellow pilots perish.  Basil Rathbone plays their commander, forced to send his green recruits to almost certain death.  For a late 1930's movie, this does a good job showing the plane-to-plane battles.

The weakest in the set is another air-related movie, Dive Bomber.  Flynn plays a doctor researching ways that pilots can overcome loss of consciousness when dive bombing.  Fred MacMurray plays the test pilot who distrusts Flynn.  With little real adventure, this movie doesn't really exploit Flynn's talents, even with Curtiz directing again.

Gentleman Jim is a fictional biography of boxer Jim Corbett, who came to prominence just as boxing began to be a legitimate sport.  Flynn plays the title character with his standard easy going charm.  Of course, the movie has to culminate in a big title match, but the path to that match is a lot of fun.

Last in the bunch and the best is Adventures of Don Juan, which successfully recreates the swashbuckling Flynn and owes more than a little to Adventures of Robin Hood.  In this film, Flynn plays the legendary wooer of woman who is called upon to save Queen and country (Spain) against a coup.  This has it all:  Flynn, a nasty villain played by Robert Douglas, a beautiful queen played by Viveca Lindfors, a wonderful sidekick with Alan Hale, the music of Steiner again and the direction of Vincent Sherman, all put together with plenty of wit and swordplay.

All of the movies come with the Warner Night at the Movies special feature except Dive Bomber (another reason this one is the weakest in the set).  This special feature allows the viewer to see a movie preview, newsreel, short subject and cartoon from the year of the movie's release.  There are other extras as well, including commentary on Adventures of Don Juan.  In short, between the movies and the extras, this is a five-star set and once again showcases why Flynn was one of the biggest stars of the 1930s and 1940s.",1188777600,2,3135,4.762962962962963

2718261,5,B000M2E31I,"Flynn had always been a favorite of mine when I was growing up.  He was so great as a pirate, pilot, or whatever he took on as a role.  I bought this collection primarily for ""Dawn Patrol.""  As a retired fighter pilot, Vietnam and earlier era, all of us pilots watched Dawn Patrol while on air defense alert.  I still feel that this movie catches the dilemma of being a pilot and then being a commander that has to send his pilots up to die.  Much the same as in Twelve O'Clock High and Command Decision, the commanders all had the same experiences.  The cast in this one is outstanding:  Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone, David Niven (another favorite actor of mine), Barry Sullivan, Donald Crisp, and on.. all wonderful!  The experience level of the young pilots when they arrived for combat was horrendously low, accounting for their short-lived careers.  If any one of them could survive a few weeks, gained experience, and did not get shot down, they stood a chance of getting a lot of missions.  Some didn't make it past the first day!  Good aerial combat scenes for the technology at the time.  Special effects nowadays produce stunning aerial scenes as in the current movie ""Flyboys.""  I liked Flyboys, but Dawn Patrol is still the best.  The devil-may-care attitude of these young fighter pilots was one of the reasons I chose to go into the Air Force when I became of age.

This is a great study of the stresses of command and the responsibilities that come with it.  I look forward to watching the rest of the movies in the collection.",1182816000,4,1541,4.569343065693431
2718267,4,B000M2E31I,"A nice treat for ERROL FLYNN fans, but a bit disappointing when compared to the Signature Collection No. 1 which featured better special features and more intriguing commentaries than are offered here.

The major assets here are three Flynn films that have stood the test of time very well--THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (teaming him with his favorite leading lady Olivia de Havilland and a sterling British cast); THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN directed with taste and style with a robust sense of humor by Vincent Sherman who also does some light narration; and GENTLEMAN JIM which features one of Flynn's most satisfying performances in a top-notch production directed by Raoul Walsh and featuring a wonderful supporting role by Ward Bond as John L. Sullivan.

Other than that, THE DAWN PATROL, while interesting as an early Flynn vehicle co-starring him with David Niven, is not quite up to classic status with its stock footage from the earlier version; and DIVE BOMBER, while it looks gorgeous in Technicolor, is way below par as a story of flight surgeons working on methods to control altitude problems for pilots battling black-outs due to cockpit pressures in 1941.

The extra features are just ""okay"" but nothing to get excited about. Flynn does prove in DAWN PATROL and GENTLEMAN JIM that he was a much better actor than critics ever acknowledged and his fans will certainly enjoy his work here.

ALEXIS SMITH is gorgeous in the Technicolored DIVE BOMBER, although her role is very peripheral, and does extremely well as his sweetheart in GENTLEMAN JIM.

And, of course, it's nice to see such a pristine print of THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE which features Flynn and Patric Knowles as brothers in love with the same young lady (Olivia de Havilland) and a cast that includes Donald Crisp, Spring Byington, David Niven and Nigel Bruce.

Sharp-eyed fans will notice that THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN includes some footage from both ROBIN HOOD and ELIZABETH AND ESSEX for filler material, but the footage is blended in remarkably well and the DON JUAN film has been given the lavish Technicolor treatment Warner Bros. bestowed on those earlier films.

A nice package, but far from perfect.",1181260800,3,2196,4.934959349593496
2718268,5,B000M2E31I,"These handsome DVD transfers confirm opinions held in some cases over 50 years.  ""Don Juan"", while not as brilliant as some Technicolor restorations (Adventures of Robin Hood, Wizard of Oz) looks gorgeous, and the tongue-in-cheek commentary by 90 years plus director Vince Sherman confirms the impression of super teamwork at the always economical Warner studio of those days.

""Gentleman Jim"" is one of Raoul Walsh's delightful sentimental comedies, and not surprisingly one of Flynn's own favourites.  ""Light Brigade"" is  a brilliant print , and far more spectacular than remembered - and what a cast.  Mike Curtiz has his usual fun with battle scenes and spectacle, and the only black mark is for cruel treatment of the horses in the charge scene.  ""Dawn Patrol"" is superbly cast and scripted, and directed with great flair by the often overlooked Edmund Goulding, settled into Warner's after being fired by Louis B Mayer, and doing a wonderful job on uncharacteristic material.  Goulding's efforts are only a little spoiled by the poor special effects re-used from The 1930 Howard Hawks version, but the aerial battles stand up well.  Flynn shows he really is an actor, magnificently supported by Rathbone, Niven and the ever-reliable Donald Crisp.  Those were the days...

""Dive Bomber"" is the least of the bunch, but no Curtiz picture is entirely without interest, and early Technicolor continues to be a revelation.

A great set, with the usual nutty extra features, Vitaphone shorts, newsreels, Merrie Melodies and so forth.  Great entertainment, with Flynn at his considerable best.",1179360000,3,1591,5.24505928853755

2718275,5,B000M2E31I,"Months ago I reviewed volume one of this DVD Flynn filmography and carped my behind off about the fact that a ""signature"" collection of Errol Flynn

films that failed to include ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" was close on to insanity, and opined at the time that this must mean a volume two was in the works that would be headlined by ""Charge"", and might also include the marvelous ""Gentleman Jim"". Happily, it looks like I was right.

This second Flynn ""Signature"" collection has both ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" and ""Gentleman Jim"" included, as well as ""Adventures of Don Juan"", ""Dive Bomber"", and ""The Dawn Patrol"" , and is a pretty decent cross-sampling of the actor's product.

I have stated in reviews before that ""Light Brigade"" remains...after all these decades...the single most amazing footage of horse action ever put to film. The charge in the movie is as legendary in its own right as the real charge at Balaclava was. In its stuntwork, cinematography, and editing, it is an absolute jaw-dropper. The screen story leading up to the charge is a fictitious weaving of events based on India's Sepoy rebellion and is used to develop audience repugnance for a villain named Surat Khan, who later appears with the Russians in the Crimea. The sequence where Khan is confronted by Flynn's Geoffrey Vickers at the movie's end is a classic cinema moment of ""you're gonna get YOURS, sucker!"".

Now for Dive Bomber. I mention this film specifically because it relates directly to spurious nonsense put out in a book called ""The Secret Life of Errol Flynn"" by Charles Higham , published back in the late 70s and claiming that Flynn was some kind of Nazi spy. Long discredited by more grounded researchers, among the claims made in this ""biography"" was that Flynn ""had"" Dive Bomber made at Pearl Harbor so he could get shots of the naval base to get to the Japanese so they could plan their attack. This was/is utter rubbish. Flynn had no power to ""have' movie footage shot at his beck and call. The old Studio System didn't work that way. You were a

contract employee and you went where the studio sent you and did what they told you. You had NO say in the matter. So Flynn couldn't ""arrange"" ANYTHING with regard to ""Dive Bomber"". AS to Pearl Harbor, it is never shown in the movie. No Battleship Row, no naval base, no nothing....for while the opening of the film declares itself to be ""In Hawaiian Waters"", this is a fiction as all of Dive Bomber was shot at San Diego, with some footage added from NAS Pensacola (and land-based Japanese spies had all the details of Pearl in Imperial hands before Dive Bomber ever filmed).

Watch this movie and understand from it how totally LAME and stupid Higham's claims were.

Watch it also with something ELSE in mind. ""DB"" has, in effect, a companion movie out there in DVD-land that is well worth a looking at.

That movie is John Ford's/John Wayne's ""The Wings of Eagles"" ,the biography of famed naval aviator Frank ""Spig"" Wead. a pioneer of the Fleet air arm. Breaking his back in a fall down some stairs (as shown with Wayne in the film), Wead became a disabled retired officer who turned Hollywood screenwriter and Broadway playwright. Two famous films are the products of ""Spig"" Wead's mind and fingertips; ""They Were Expendable"", with Duke and Robert Montgomery, and ""Dive Bomber"". The latter came right out of Wead's own experiences in Naval aviation, and from that of his colleagues. An ongoing bit of inter-service ""ragging"" between army and navy pilots goes on in ""Wings of Eagles"" and shows up again in ""Dive Bomber"". A massed flight of bombers roars over a navy assemblage at ""Pearl Harbor"" early in the film and is watched by a visiting army type, who allows as how they fly ""almost as good as army pilots"". This is PURE ""Spig"" Wead.  Watch Dive Bomber and The Wings of Eagles both and see how they correlate to each other.

""Adventures of Don Juan"" is Flynn's last big WB epic swashbuckler. It was a tough shoot, basically because of Flynn's increasing dissipation due to mild TB and increased boozing and drugging. Look closely at him and realize that there is a lot of help from make-up here in making him look better than in real life....and that only THIRTEEN years separate Don Juan from Captain Blood. View the two films sequentially and the realization is stunning. Don Juan doesn't look thirteen years older than Peter Blood----he looks twenty or twenty-FIVE years older! Flynn's downhill run here is saddening. Don Juan is a GOOD movie though; beautifully shot and edited and well crafted by Vincent Sherman. It ran long in production due to Flynn's illnesses , but Sherman pieced it all together brilliantly. The Score by Max Steiner is a masterpiece and the difficult leap down the bottom of a staircase at the end was done by stuntman Jock (""Jocko"") Mahoney, who later turned actor and played ""The Range Rider"" and ""Yancy Derringer"" on 1950s television.

""Gentleman Jim"" was among Flynn's favorite Flynn movies and his enthusiasm shows in his performance. The charm is on full blast. The fight scenes were very well staged and believable and much of this was because Flynn actually had been a boxer in Australia prior to his movie career. A scene at the end of the film with Corbett exchanging admirations with John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond)is touchingly depicted.

great movie.

""The Dawn Patrol"" is another winner and it allows Flynn to ACT. And he shows he can do that very thing. This is a good performance and fits right in with the performances of Basil Rathbone, David Niven, and others.

Flying scenes and battle scenes are excellent here, even if some of the footage hasn't stood up to the aging process that well. As good a film as ""Hell's Angels"" in many respects, although not as visually spectacular.

All told, an excellent volume two. And still out there are: Virginia City, San Antonio, Desperate Journey, Edge of Darkness, Objective Burma,

Santa Fe Trail, Rocky Mountain, Montana, Silver River, perhaps The Prince & the Pauper, and two or three others to ponder. You could likely get four volumes of good entertainment oput of old Errol.

The Warner Bros Night at the movies concept is really terrific and they seem to work hard to dig up material from the day that really add to the experience and place the films  in historical context.

and speaking of the films...WOW!  Its nice to see Errol out of the green tights and in a suit and tie. There isn't a clunker in the group...Charge of the light brigade is a stone cold  classic and another in a long series of pairings with Ms DeHavilland, Dawn Patrol features David Niven (also co-starring in Charge)...Dive Bomber is an early Technicolor triumph and perhaps the jewel of the collection is Gentleman Jim (reportedly Flynn's favorite of his films).  What Flynn set would be complete however without a swashbuckler  and Adventures of Don  Juan ...delivers the goods with a brilliant technicolor transfer ...and commentary by the late great director Vincent Sherman!!

To some of us, however, ""Dive Bomber"" is special. I agree that the dialogue's corny, and the storyline isn't very close to the reality of flight research of the time. Still, it was filmed, with great cooperation from the Navy, just months before our entry into WWII, at the end of the most colorful era in aviation. The scenes of actual carrier operations, filmed on the USS Enterprise, and the SB2U's, F3F's, TBD's, and other planes, yellow wings and all, in glorious Technicolor, are a priceless record of the time. It hasn't been widely available on DVD before, and some of us are very glad to have it now.

The same can surely be said about the wonderful Errol Flynn.

Warner Bros. has been quite generous in delivering us many Flynn titles in recent years, and there are dozens to go! This latest set will not dissapoint his fans, with 5 entertaining, classic vehicles, assembled in an impressive newly designed sleeve that takes the WB Signature Collection series to a higher plane of elegance and magnetism.

Every film here is top-drawer, but my particular favorite has to be CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE. An undeniable classic which has never looked so good. All the transfers here are the best I've ever seen, and the vintage extras Warner has included are like the cherry on top of the sundae.

I'm sure WB has another 2 or 3 Flynn sets waiting in the wings...and why not. He made several dozen films for the studio, and only a handful don't classify as timeless entertainment.",1174780800,22,1159,4.903061224489796

I agree with the reviewer who stated that Four's A Crowd would have been a good choice over Dive Bomber.  Flynn was a truly good actor when he applied himself and he gave a strong comedy effort in Four's A Crowd.  This collection had more variety than Volume One set and Four's A Crowd would have given an even broader look at Flynn's total body of work.

Another movie which could and should have been included was Objective Burma.  Not only is it one of Flynn's best overall films, it's the best of the several World War II films that Flynn did.  The first Flynn collection had six DVDs in it including the documentary on Flynn himself The Adventures of Errol Flynn.  Substituting Four's A Crowd for Dive Bomber and adding Objective Burma as the sixth DVD to this second collection would have given a great cross section of Flynn's films and all six would have been well worth watching.

Nonetheless, I'm grateful that Warners did issue this second collection.  Hopefully there will be a third one.  I'd recommend Four's A Crowd, Objective Burma, Prince and The Pauper, Master of Ballantrae, Santa Fe Trail, Silver River and/or Edge of Darkness.",1173225600,5,1359,4.716101694915254
2718283,4,B000M2E31I,"Any new Flynn DVD collection is a good thing but the addition of ""Dive Bomber"" is a head-scratcher.  ""Charge"" and ""Gentlemen Jim"" are classics so no argument there plus ""Dawn Patrol"" is a worthy choice.  By the time ""Don Juan"" was filmed, Errol was getting long in the tooth.  However, it was definitely his last good swashbuckler film and major starring role.  Wonderful sets and production.  Interesting note:  the budget for Don Juan nearly reached $3.5(m) which was big bank in 1948.

My choice instead of ""Dive Bomber"" would have been ""Four's A Crowd"".  His first film after ""Robin Hood"", great cast, lots of fun and Errol actually gives a nice comedic performance. A change of pace for Flynn and he pulls it off.  Don't agree with those who wanted ""Edge of Darkness"".  An interesting film but Errol's mind was elsewhere.

2718285,5,B000M2E31I,"While every Errol Flynn fan has individual titles they will champion as 'Essential' Flynn, ""The Errol Flynn Signature Collection, Vol. 2"", combined with the first volume, offers a pretty complete collection of the premier screen cavalier's most memorable screen appearances...and two of the films in this collection (""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" and ""The Adventures of Don Juan""), are absolute MUSTS!

""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936): Flynn's follow-up to ""Captain Blood"" is a tour-de-force of adventure, romance, and spectacle, climaxing in, arguably, the greatest (and bloodiest) cavalry charge in screen history! More Rudyard Kipling than Tennyson, most of the story occurs in India, with noble Flynn saving the life of a genocide-minded tyrant, losing Olivia de Havilland (for once!) to future 'Will Scarlet' Patric Knowles, and chumming with doomed best friend (both on and off screen), David Niven. Eventually the action moves to the Crimea, and the infamous Charge, an astonishing spectacle that, sadly, cost the lives of at least one stunt man, and hundreds of horses (Flynn, himself, would be so distraught by the carnage that he helped establish the present standards against animal cruelty).

Unforgettable!

""The Adventures of Don Juan"" (1948): Warner's attempt to resuscitate Flynn's sagging career failed, but the film is an absolutely enchanting, tongue-in-cheek swashbuckler many consider his last 'great' film! Looking a bit worn (he fell off the wagon early in the production, which ended up taking nearly a year to complete), Flynn is the immortal rou, too often caught during trysts (a familiar real-life dilemma for Flynn!). Returned to Spain in disgrace, accompanied by loyal Alan Hale (in the last of his 12 films with Errol), he eventually wins the heart of the Queen, foils a plot to overthrow the monarchy, and fights a furious duel with villain Robert Douglas, all to one of the GREATEST of Max Steiner's scores!

A real TREAT!

Two other films of the collection are also great Flynn; ""The Dawn Patrol"" (1938) re-teams Flynn with David Niven and Basil Rathbone (a VERY sympathetic 'villain', this time!), in one of the BEST WWI dramas, of burnt-out fliers pushed to their limits; ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942), one of Flynn's own personal favorites, is a funny, light-hearted biopic of boxer James J. Corbett, father of 'modern' boxing, with fabulous turns by Alan Hale (as Flynn's FATHER!), and Ward Bond (unforgettable as the aging John L. Sullivan).

The only (slight) disappointment is ""Dive Bomber"" (1941), in the collection, I suspect, because it was filmed in color! A dated tale of the Navy's research into the effects of high altitude flying on pilots, the film boasts a first-rate cast (including Fred MacMurray and Ralph Bellamy), and Flynn at his most handsome, but it lacks the charm and excitement of the other titles...Still, this isn't a bad film!

8165801,1,B000M2E31I,This set of disk will not play on any DVD or Blu Ray player that I can find as they are recorded in a dual layer format. I even purchased a new DVD player which accepted dual layer disc and they still won't load.  With Amazon's return policy I'll lose 50% on my return as the package is opened.  I'll just use them for coasters.  Buy these with this in mind.,1477526400,,358,4.014084507042254
