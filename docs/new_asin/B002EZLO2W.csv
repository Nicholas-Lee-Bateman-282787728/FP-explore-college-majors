3920686,4,B002EZLO2W,"Ruda Maxa gives a true tourist's vision of the places he visits...he not only presents the regular tourist sites, but he combines them with a bit of history and culture so that those who watch the videos get a more well rounded view of the places he visits. I have used these as part of my history class and my students enjoy the videos a lot and they are a nice change from traditional historical biographies and such.",1356220800,5,419,4.384615384615385

8368635,5,B002EZLO2W,"We enjoy Rudy's presentation of the place and the inclusion of extended musical performances, something we miss when seeing his programs on TV.  The reader's Digest 12 places trip disc was obviously taken from this set - if you have the RD disc there is much more information in this set.",1486684800,,288,4.647058823529412

8368639,5,B002EZLO2W,"I really do enjoy this travel dvd and only been to one location in it, Buenos Aires. The quality of this dvd is very good, I have watch it 1080p HD TV and on a 4K TV too. It is entertaining and Rudy is not boring host.

But what is so special to me and I come back to watch it again is this.

For every location, there is a separate commentary track where Rudy and the producer talk about the place they are shooting, giving it color, opinions and some insights. So there is 12 locations on the six disk DVD add the 12 commentary, you have 24 episodes to watch. For example in the Buenos Aires show Rudy buys a leather jacket and talks about it more on the commentary episode, more than he did in the regular episode. In another commentary episode Rudy makes mention that leather jacket he is wearing is the one he bought in Buenos Aires.  There is a lot of these gems in the commentary.",1444176000,,887,4.145348837209302

8368641,5,B002EZLO2W,"Bought at son's request. Great overview . Autistic son watches over and over! Great for him. Broadens his interests, Keeps him away from the video games! This is a favorite. I watched them also. Infirmative. Makes me want to visit Bankok. Fun.",1395532800,2,243,4.809523809523809
8368642,5,B002EZLO2W,"As someone had mentioned, yes, there are commercials.  However, they are at the beginning and end of the shows, not during.  It isn't bothersome to me because, just like movies have preview trailers before them, travel shows often have commercials and they can be fast-forwarded through.  They do need to receive their funding from somewhere, so I understand.

Now, to the actual shows.  Rudy Maxa, as always, is very entertaining, with a great sense of humor and lots of interesting historical and cultural information in these shows.  Well-hosted and well-filmed, with vivid photography and excellent music, this set is a great buy for travel show enthusiasts or people just starting out with travel shows, especially at its discounted price.",1394582400,3,744,5.2100840336134455
8368643,3,B002EZLO2W,"While taking us to places we've never visited, the presentation seemed to lack some enthusiasm.  Mrs Maxa's earlier travelogues seems like he was really enjoying the travel.  No so here.",1393459200,,186,5.166666666666667
