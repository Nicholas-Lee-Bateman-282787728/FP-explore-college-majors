8210942,3,B000TSTEN2,"When it comes to cartoons today, we think of Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron and many other ones from Nickelodeon. But from the classic days where animation was looney and filled with joy, we really don't see that anymore. A lot of the younger era doesn't actually appreciate the funnt cartoons that Warner Brothers Looney Tunes have made, as some of the most influential cartoons of all time. The Golden Collection 1-4 have all done a pretty good job at highlighting the best in animation anyway around. But, there have also been the lesser-priced Spotlight collections, which really haven't delivered the way of promise. Now that the upcoming Volume 5 is heading to video stores soon, it still shows how much the bar is set high.

The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volume 1-5 is a 10 disc DVD set which features the previous Spotlight Collections 1-4, as well as the new Volume 5. The DVD collections don't completely deliver unlike the Golden Collections have showcased. Still, there are about 100 great classics from Warner Brothers past which have been remastered fairly well, except for the original premiere collection, which had some problems with the cartoons audio not being restored properly. There are though a lot of good cartoons here including classic like What's Opera Doc?, the Bob Clampett classic with Daffy Duck, The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, and the one-toon wonder hit with Michigan J. Frog, One Froggy Evening. On top of that, the new volume 5 features some great delights including Ali-Baba Bunny, The Abominable Snow Rabbit, and A Star Is Bored. While most of those cartoons are still fun, the only one volume that completely seperates itself nicely is volume 3: The Movie Collection, which was the only volume that was not highlighting shorts. Instead, two classic Looney Tunes movies were highlighted: The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie, which worked well by the late great Chuck Jones, and Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie 1001 Rabbit Tales.

All in all, the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volumes 1-5 isn't actually a must buy for die hard fans, as much as it really tries to re-introduce Bugs, Porky Pig and Daffy Duck to a whole new audience. The only stand out Volume 3: The Movie Collection is the one from the smaller editions, I absolutely recommend. I suggest instead you really await for the Golden Collection Volume 5, and if you don't own the Golden Collections 1-4, get them instead. That really should be all folks!
