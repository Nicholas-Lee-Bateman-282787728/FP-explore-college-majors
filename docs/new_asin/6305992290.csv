7899161,5,6305992290,"I remember watching this series religiously back when it premiered in 1994, and wishing it had lasted longer.  It set up a really cool futuristic universe in where a trio of siblings are royalty and their father has passed away.  The royal family's baron tries to take over the city by stealing the city's source of power, a crystal.  By doing this the crystal is split into two, causing Baron Dark to transform into a skeleton, making him virtually indestructable.  The three royal siblings also take on special powers of their own and from that point on an ongoing battle begins between the family and Baron Dark's army of skeletons he creates.  I remember this show being a very exciting, action packed show with a lot of great conflict between both opposing sides.  They should put the entire series out on DVD for those who remember it and enjoyed it.  It has a small cult following and I think would make a really awesome live action movie.  Think Pirates of the Carribean combined with Star Wars and that will give you a good idea.",1147651200,8,1038,4.603260869565218
