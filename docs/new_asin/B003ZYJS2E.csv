8411323,1,B003ZYJS2E,It is a low budget movie and that is definitely visible and made us exit about 30-minutes into it. The acting is deplorable and the cast is hard to watch. It may lead to something interesting but at the point we exited we didn't care to find out. I don't mind watching bad movies but it has to have something to keep me involved such as a cast and/or lead character thats actually entertaining. Suffice it to say that the first third of this movie is about as deplorable as they come and whatever story they were trying to tell had to be done with a better cast and script if they wanted to engage the viewer.,1512172800,,609,4.213675213675214
8411324,5,B003ZYJS2E,Reading some of these reviews you would think that some of you saw a different movie. You can Only understand things as much as Your perception and experience will allow you to. I don't care about budgets smh Amazing movie. It kept you in suspense to the very end. Storyline was definitely believable depending on your life I guess. I think this is a must watch. It was a Deep movie. If you're not a deep person this may Not be for you. Don't go off any negative reviews...,1506124800,,473,4.325842696629214
8411325,2,B003ZYJS2E,"When i looked at the cover of the dvd i thought it was gonna be the bomb. But when i looked at the whole thing, i didn't like the middle when the guy killed the woman cause she wouldnt give him any. I didn't like when the girl turned up dead that the parents was looking for, for 2 weeks.",1375920000,,288,3.816666666666667
8411326,4,B003ZYJS2E,"I read the other reviews on this film and thought I'd give it a look. After watching it, I found Smeslavich's review completely inaccurate to the point where I'm wondering if that person even saw this movie.
The movie came off as more of a suspense-horror in an Alfred Hitchcock type momentum. It wasn't full of typical Hollywood over the top effects, so it left more for the brain to process and draw conclusions, like a visual form of reading a good book.
It was a good story that was fully tenable in a real life way, which I think for me is what made it the most creepy. The end left a bit void of closure on the main character's quest, but it didn't matter entirely since the movie shows the viewers what had happened.
Overall, I feel it was a well thought out story that was not detracted from at all by the sometimes apparent lower budget of this film. It was worth the watch and leaves more than enough to ponder after it is done. This was a well done and somewhat disturbing movie.",1324684800,,990,4.2994652406417115
8411327,1,B003ZYJS2E,"Positives:
Created on a very low budget in a house and a motel room in LA so not much lost in production costs.
Most of the actor's filmography credits consists of TV spots, shorts and videos. So acting expectations shouldn't be too high.
Directing and acting experience was on the short side of a short list. So everybody needs to start somewhere.

Negatives:
Writing & directing had that narcissistic, self-indulgent see how clever I can be storyline. Unfortunately an obsession with the voyeuristic sex of molestation, date rape and multiple partners did nothing toward understanding those issues but was just fragmented exhibitionism.
Dialogue oscillated between way over the top non-believable to read a line-by-line robotic and monotonous unbelievable. About as natural as a late night TV infomercial.
Cinematography at both locations had that camera-on-a-tripod panning endlessly feel.
Storyline one, of a motel sex triangle was laughable in how it was presented and implemented. One girl naked from the waist up kissing another girl, that's it. I would give it an appropriate for daytime TV level rating.
Storyline two, is in the same motel room the day before, of a drug date rape attempt by a women's close friend but then kills her because she wouldn't participate was incredulous.
Storyline three, of the aforementioned killer and accomplice coming back to the motel room the next day to recover an earring and finding the sex triangle people and then deciding to kill them.
Storyline four, of father who molested his own daughter (from storyline one) was bizarre. It was briefly mentioned at the end as the killers sought to blackmail him with release of that information if he doesn't stop looking for his daughter.

Summary:
Very disjointed and not believable series of events supposedly connected by chance but a chance series that would be a one in a billion perfect storm. None of the stories had any finish or ending. The viewer is left with ""well, so, now what?"".",1323043200,,1983,5.061162079510703
8411328,5,B003ZYJS2E,"I found this film to be somewhat disturbing at times,and dark also.
  But somehow, this is the very reason I kept watching from beggining to end. It's so disturbing  at times that you want to keep watching just to see
 if it will end good or bad. There are a few story lines involved,but they come together brilliantly,but again be careful,each has it's own disturbing twist.
 If the darker side of humanity bothers you, then this is not the film for you to watch......but if you can somehow overcome that,to see
 brilliant writing, then you will definitely like this movie.",1306886400,,574,4.69
8411329,5,B003ZYJS2E,"Once in a while an independent film blows me away.  It doesn't happen often. It's tough to make a movie, particularly with limited resources.  And regardless of budget, it's tough to make an audience care for 10 characters in 88 minutes.  But RULE OF THREE, I'm thrilled to report, is a rare exception.

Made by the very talented Eric Shapiro (Director and story) and Rhoda Jordan (screenplay and star), RO3 follows three interconnected storylines.  A father searches frantically for his missing daughter, a beautiful young couple prepares for a threesome, and a man looks to score Roofalin from a cagey sociopath.  Each story takes place, except for a few scenes, in the same hotel room.  And nothing, based on first appearances, is what it seems.  To explain the film further would be an injustice to those who have not seen it.

Jordan's script peels layers back masterfully.  Shapiro's direction is equally patient, always in rhythm with the character's moods.  The acting is first rate, too; every performance feels real.  RO3 runs like a Swiss timepiece, nothing feels rushed or outstays its welcome.  I look for great things in the future from the Shapiro/Jordan team - they've blown me away with their debut.

Do yourself a favor, buy or rent RULE OF THREE today!",1289174400,3,1271,4.906103286384977
8411330,4,B003ZYJS2E,"I love smart independent films like this.  I saw this movie at a film festival last year and was really impressed by it, enough to want to buy it when it came out on DVD.  It's relentlessly creepy and atmospheric, but intelligent and very cleverly constructed, interweaving 3 separate storylines within the same location.  And the performances are genuinely terrific, some of the best you'll find in independent film.  If you like your thrillers with smarts and character-driven drama that's actually connected to reality, give this one a look.",1288310400,3,544,5.078651685393258
8411331,5,B003ZYJS2E,The writing in this movie is great and the story-structure is amazingly inventive. If only more horror movies were this thought-provoking. I loved it!!,1286841600,6,151,5.333333333333333
