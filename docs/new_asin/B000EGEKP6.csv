8109457,2,B000EGEKP6,"I was really disappointed with this DVD.  Christi seems nice and like a fun instructor, but the moves are just ridiculous.  I like step that has a mix of high & low intensity aerobics, plus some strength building moves.  Her basic routine is ok, but in my opinion she just ruins it by trying to get too frilly & fancy.  So many twirls & spins.  That doesn't do anything except make you dizzy.  I found myself creating my own steps as I went along.  For example, while she would do figure 8's, pivots, and circles...I would do squats, lunges, or knee raises.  I also found some of her moves to be too fast paced & switched around too much which is hard on the knee joints.  It was pretty repetitive too, so I found it a bit boring.  I really wish I didn't waste my money on it.  Why can't Tammilee Webb make her ""Buns of Steel"" on DVD?  I loved her step workouts.  I guess I'll try some of the other DVD's on Amazon.",1252540800,,915,4.16
8109458,1,B000EGEKP6,"I bought this DVD after reading the excellent reviews it got.  I just put it in for the fist time and couldn't get past the warm up.  The instructor never once used left leg or right leg ques.  I never knew what to expect.  I wouldn't even donate this DVD to the library.  It went straight into the trash.  A total waste of hard earned money.  If you're looking for good, easy to follow step DVD's, go to the source, Gin Miller.  Christi Taylor could learn a boatload from her.",1242000000,,477,4.222222222222222
8109459,5,B000EGEKP6,"I love this Christi Taylor workout.  It's complex enough that it doesn't get boring, but with Christi's great instruction method and continual prompting, anyone can ""get it"" pretty quickly.  Plus there's Movemaster if you need it.  And the music is great.  ""Double-kicker ball change"" is one of the FUN steps in the step portion.  BUY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!",1187395200,4,355,4.9491525423728815
8109460,5,B000EGEKP6,"I love this workout.  I can't believe what a difference this and Christi's other workouts have made in both my shape and my physical fitness.  These are very high quality workouts--well choreographed and well thought out.  I highly recommend all of her workouts.  What I especially like about this one is the variety.  I can do the whole thing and have the variety of Step and Hi/Lo or when I'm pinched for time, I can pick one of the 30 min segments--40 with warm up and cool down.  I also love that I never get tired of doing her workouts.  They are complex so you start out doing just the basic routine and over time you can add in the extra pivots, spins etc. Take advantage of the Move Master to help you be able to keep up your first time. Don't let the complexity scare you away, you'll get it!",1168819200,7,801,4.264900662251655
8109461,5,B000EGEKP6,"I have all of Christi's workouts.  I bought this already from another online source and I had no hesitation in getting it sight unseen because all her other workouts are beyond fantastic.  I knew this would be too, and it is.  She is so full of energy and enthusiasm and she keeps it all interesting by singing along to the music and not being fake like some other instructors.  She seems to lead this workout like she would if she were actually teaching a live aerobic class.

In this workout, there are two main segments; floor and step.  Her choreography is always unique and may be hard to follow at first, but gets easier plus there is a bonus section of easy to follow instructions of most movements broken down.  During the workout, she always begins with a base pattern and then does add on's to make it better for you to pick up the moves.

Whenever you buy a Christi Taylor workout, you know you'll be in for a good workout with lots of sweat and lots of calories burnt.",1141689600,8,980,4.375690607734807
