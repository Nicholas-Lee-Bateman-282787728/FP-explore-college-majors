8699874,1,B00SYX6LIK,"I was completely unaware that there were regional differences with DVDs. I was aware this was coming from another country and read until I found out that yes, it was in English. I assumed it was all good and I was getting a great deal. THEY WILL NOT PLAY ON MY BLU-RAY OR DVD PLAYERS. I thought something was wrong with my machine. I called a local electronics store and was informed about the regional differences. Hopefully, the place I ordered it from will be kind and give me a refund.",1522627200,4,489,4.384615384615385
