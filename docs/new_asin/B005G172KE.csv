4687079,4,B005G172KE,"The ""bye bye pacifier"" portion of this DVD is about 1/3 of the overall content. The rest is about riding bikes and getting hair cuts, both of which were pretty inapplicable to my daughter who already rides a strider with confidence and doesn't need her hair cut (probably for years!)",1365206400,,283,4.68
4687080,5,B005G172KE,"We are doing to training with the song, ""bye bye binky, binky bye-bye... and so far, it has been difficult but she knows its coming soon.",1359244800,,137,4.3076923076923075
4687081,5,B005G172KE,"Our 2 year old son LOVE LOVE LOVES Elmo. He is also adicted to his Paci.. or binky or what ever he wants to call it that day.. usualy ""bah"". This episode of Elmo is helping him try to break himself of the ""binky"". We always remind him that ELMO doesnt use a binky anymore.. and he is a ""big boy"". He still loves the show and asks for it frequently though he has made it clear he is Not ready to say ""bye Bye Binky""",1350950400,,414,3.8255813953488373
4687082,4,B005G172KE,"I was worried about getting our 2 year old to give up the pacifier before the new baby came (only used at night & couldn't sleep without it) and so I bought this.  I played it a lot and the actual story about the pacifier is great but it is sandwiched in between other ""big kid"" stories.  I almost think it gets lost in the mix to be honest.  Not sure if it really helped the 2 year old but it did help me come up with a story that the pacifier fairy took the pacifiers & left a toy, etc. instead- which is one of the scenarios from the movie.  If your kid loves Sesame Street then I say go for it if your concerned about pacifiers but I'm not sure if I'd spend the $ again.",1347408000,,674,3.86231884057971
4687083,5,B005G172KE,My one year old was glued to the tv when I played this video for him and he doesn't really sit still for longer than 5-10 min at a time. I used this and other videos when he is having a meal and he just absolutely loves them.,1346803200,,225,3.7083333333333335
4687084,5,B005G172KE,The song in this video is so endearing.  I find myself humming it while I am at work.  My daughter is getting ready to get rid of her binky and I think that this video might just do the trick.,1334966400,,192,3.775
4687085,3,B005G172KE,"My daughter is at the age where I'd like her to ditch her binky. She LOVES Elmo so I thought this video would be perfect. Unfortunately, there is no description of the video included with this listing so I assumed the entire video was about giving up your pacifier. In actuality, only the first fifteen minutes is about saying bye bye to your binky. The rest is two other short stories--one about learning to ride a trike and one about getting a haircut. If I had known this beforehand, I probably would have looked for something else. However, if you're just looking for a cute Sesame Street video, it's not a bad choice.",1333411200,5,622,4.513274336283186
4687086,3,B005G172KE,My grandson is almost two and his parents want the binky gone.  He had it in his mouth whenever he could find it and had to have it to go to sleep at night and afternoons.  I sat down and watched the movie with him.  He loves Elmo so that kept him watching but the show got rather long for him.  I think it did get the point across though because shortly after his binky actually broke and he handled it very well.  His mom reminded him of how Elmo handled letting his go.,1325980800,2,472,3.978723404255319
4687087,5,B005G172KE,"My son loves this DVD.  Good stories and music. Unfortunately, he has not given up his pacifier yet. lol",1432080000,,104,4.473684210526316
4687088,4,B005G172KE,"This was bought for our 2yr grandsons, one is addicted to his pacifier, and we are hoping this will help him give it up.
They both enjoy the movie, it keeps them interested for quite awhile.",1425859200,,190,4.305555555555555

4687093,5,B005G172KE,"We bought this for our granddaughter. The price was cheaper than competitors. She loves both Elmo and her bink, so we're hoping for some help here!",1415404800,,147,4.6923076923076925
4687094,5,B005G172KE,My daughter loves Elmo.  The video does focus on getting rid of the pacifier but it also focuses on other transitional behavior steps such as potty training. She isn't at the age for potty training yet but the video helped with getting rid of the pacifier.,1406160000,,256,4.565217391304348
4687095,4,B005G172KE,great product!!,1405296000,,15,7.0
4687096,3,B005G172KE,"For some reason, my son is not as hooked on this one as his other DVDs including other Elmo ones. Most of them are on repeat constantly.",1402358400,,136,4.074074074074074
4687097,3,B005G172KE,"Our first CD arrived broken, so we returned and Amazon immediately replaced. When the replacement arrived it was intact, but when we removed it from the case, it broke and was unplayable. (I figured that was on me, and I didn't return it).  That's a shame, because it's a good episode.",1395273600,,285,4.588235294117647
4687098,4,B005G172KE,"My son loves elmo and we are having a hard time getting him to give up the paci so will see if Elmos common sense helps our son. Really adorable with getting rid of the paci, first haircut, and learning to ride a bike.",1390867200,,218,3.977272727272727
4687099,1,B005G172KE,Bought this video to help our toddler give up her binky.  It was $10 wasted.  There is almost no content in this video about giving up a pacifier!,1390262400,,146,4.178571428571429
4687100,4,B005G172KE,My 22 month old loves it! She's sings the 'Bye-Bye Paci' song all the time! She might understand it better when she's a little older.,1388620800,,133,4.36
4687101,1,B005G172KE,"Extremely long and boring. They talk to much. Child gets bored. Need to be more interesting for kids that age... which supposedly Elmo is, but no.",1387670400,,146,4.653846153846154
4687102,5,B005G172KE,"We used this the week before we took our daughter's pacifier away. She loved it and learned a lot by watching it. When the time came to finally take the pacifier away, it went better than we had expected. She still enjoys watching it today.",1381968000,,240,4.355555555555555
4687103,5,B005G172KE,I added this to our collection of Sesame Street/Elmo's World DVD's.  My foster children love to watch them.  They are great!,1381622400,,124,4.857142857142857
4687104,5,B005G172KE,My grandson was the one I got this for he is a great Elmo fan so of course I watched it with him never too old for Elmo.,1380758400,,120,3.3214285714285716
4687105,2,B005G172KE,"Just as an FYI: The first 15 minutes or so are about saying ""bye bye binky"", but the rest of the show is about learning to ride a bike and about getting your hair cut. Since my kids are too little to ride bikes and have been getting their hair cut since they were 1... that isn't very helpful to them.  But for the price, what are you gonna do? I suppose I should have just checked on You Tube first for the ""Bye Bye Binky"" segment for free.",1374451200,,441,3.955056179775281
4687106,5,B005G172KE,Great little movie. Worked like a charm! We watched it 3 times and BOOM she didn't want her paci any more.,1367280000,2,106,4.095238095238095
8471011,1,B005G172KE,I would not recommend this video. I think it puts ideas into children's heads that aren't necessary. My child wasn't scared to get a haircut at all until she saw this video. Also it shows too many ideas about giving up the pacifier instead of just one simple idea. It's confusing for a two year old in my opinion.,1491436800,,313,4.322033898305085
8471012,5,B005G172KE,Great teaching tool,1490832000,,19,5.666666666666667
8471013,5,B005G172KE,Fun for toddler.,1478217600,,16,4.666666666666667
8471014,3,B005G172KE,I thought it was a dvd about saying bye to the pacifier however its a very short story about it....I wanted a dvd just about the pacifier not a first hair cut etc.,1471478400,,163,3.9696969696969697
8471015,5,B005G172KE,"Is exactly as it says. It's several Elmo videos packed on the DVD. About an hour total of stuff. My 2 year old didn't give up the pacifier because of the video, but it laid some decent groundwork. Overall I like it.",1462752000,,215,4.142857142857143
8471016,4,B005G172KE,My son loves it but it hasn't helped with getting rid of the pacifier,1457481600,,69,4.0
8471017,5,B005G172KE,my little LOVED this video.,1447977600,,27,4.6
8471018,5,B005G172KE,My daughter watched this once and it clicked ...I know it's not average but bye bye binky for sure!,1447632000,,99,4.2631578947368425
8471019,4,B005G172KE,This is a very good video. My son is still not ready to give up the pacifier yet but lately he has been asking to watch this video. The process of giving up the pacifier is presented in a gentle and encouraging way. The other stories are good too. Great for a growing toddler aspiring to be a big kid.,1436745600,,301,4.033333333333333
8471020,5,B005G172KE,"My toddler adores Elmo and this trilogy of tales introducing saying goodbye to their precious pacifier, learning to ride a tricycle and the anxiety of going for a haircut are perfect for the average two or three year old. The pacifier story includes a sweet song with Elmo & Gordon.",1436054400,,282,4.66
