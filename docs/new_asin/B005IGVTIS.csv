4709419,5,B005IGVTIS,"I had a feeling that I would be amused, but I had no idea how hard I would laugh.  This is the funniest movie that I have seen in years!  What makes it so entertaining is that it's not just one type of humor.  There are puns, there are bizarre visuals, there are...  I couldn't finish that sentence because I remembered the huge amount of nudity.  If you can understand it, the abundance of nudity is itself hilarious.  Girls get naked for the most absurd reasons.  I can see how a movie like this would upset a person who's dense.  But if you've got good comprehension, expect to get a sore throat from laughing so much.",1329350400,34,621,4.293103448275862
4709420,1,B005IGVTIS,"This 'movie' does not even qualify for awful. There is not even one single line of dialog that is at the entry level of acting school. I could excuse the horrible plot and incredibly bad effects as funny if the cast even had one teeny little bit of talent.

This is a disaster on disc that runs far longer than anything this dreadful should ever be endured. If it were a 2 minute Youtube video it might have been excusable.

I forced myself to watch the entire piece just so I could write my first Amazon review. That is the measure of how much it reviled me.

Never in my life have I seen such a possibly funny idea done so badly.",1329264000,3,631,4.155737704918033

4709422,5,B005IGVTIS,"This movie is a riot.  One of Bill Zebub's finest comedies.  If you liked the humor in ""Spooked"" or ""Dolla Morte"", you'll LOVE ""Antfarm Dickhole"".  What happens to a poor guy who is constantly bullied when an ant crawls inside his urethra & lays eggs & the killer South American army ants start living inside him?  Well, you have to watch the movie to find out... But let's just say they'll do anything to protect their ""home"".  This movie is funny and weird and has a great cast of characters.  If you love Bill Zebub's movies, this will quickly become one of your favorites!  If you enjoy Independent films with low budget horror, great gags and a refreshingly original storyline, then again: This movie is for YOU!  Check out ""Antfarm Dickhole"" and you too will have ants in your pants!",1316131200,29,789,4.585714285714285
4709423,4,B005IGVTIS,"If you are already a fan of Bill Zebub, then why are you reading this you should already own this movie. It is by far one of his best works.
If you are not a fan of Mr. Zebub and/or the B movie genre then this is not for you. However if you like clever writing, outrageous original ideas, and some gratutious nudity you will love it.
Also, most copies of Antfarm also include a bonus film ""Assmonster"". While this is not his best film you'll still get a few laughs out of it.",1368662400,4,475,4.0638297872340425
4709424,1,B005IGVTIS,"Sigh... another movie by Bill Zebub that was like pulling teeth to get though. Can you believe that? I cannot fathom how he keeps making films. He's made over twenty to date (look on IMDb). I think that his friends and people that act for him are the only ones that buy his films, thus giving him just enough money to get another one made. How else can you explain such trash getting made over and over again?

Antfarm Dickhole is a mess calling itself a movie. Its plot, if you want to call it that, is about a guy that is bullied. That is, until his dickhole is invaded by army ants. Then, every time someone starts to pick on him, the ants come out to protect their host and kill the person bullying him. He decides to get revenge on people that have bullied him in the past, so he goes around, letting the ants (which are actually toy store plastic ants) kill the people he hates. He is eventually abandoned by the ants, and he goes nuts, brandishing a gun while going on a short lived killing spree before someone else (who spouts off about the great right the innocent have to bear arms) does him in. The end.

I've ruined nothing about the movie. Actually I've probably saved you 90 minutes of your life that you could be doing something more enjoyable, like watching paint dry, or pushing toothpicks under your fingernails.

Let's start with the horrible. We have horrible metal music, horrible acting, horrible special effects, and horrible editing. Now let's get to the pun. Since the movie title has the word ant in the title, the characters spend the whole movie putting ant in front of as many words as possible in the script. We have, ANT-achronism, ANT-gela, ANT-tony, ANT-drew, ANT-marie, and they even use the computer to look stuff up on the ANT-ternet. The only time I got a snicker was a completely unintentional scene where a guy is digging a hole in the dirt with a snow shovel. I have no idea why that struck me as funny, but for some reason it did. Maybe the cracks were starting to show from trying to watch this movie.

Bill Zebub is in usual form once again in this movie, padding out its length with random (not so great looking) nude women trying to look sexy. He's also at it with trying to correct everyone's language mistakes. He seems to be preaching about whatever is bothering him in the world at any given moment. And if he's not doing it, someone else in the movie is doing it for him. Completely annoying, and a waste of film. It seems as if Bill must use the first (maybe only) take for every scene, as flubbed lines are left right in along with the rest of the mess he calls a movie. Once again you can (obviously) see by the title that Bill is trying to be offensive to get attention for his causes. It's not offensive. It's stupid. His comments on society may be valid, but his means of getting them to the public are these terrible wastes of time he calls films. Maybe he should try writing a book instead. As far as this movie goes, try reading a book instead. 0/10.",1367884800,8,3010,4.388888888888889
4709425,2,B005IGVTIS,"The plot is really wacky; the ""acting'  was conspicuouly absent and the special effects were laughable.  Even the pretty naked girls could not save it.  I hope it was the producers' intent to maakeit a comedy flick.",1367107200,,215,4.756756756756757

4709429,3,B005IGVTIS,"Well, maybe you want to watch.  I had low hope for this movie, but those hopes were higher than the movie turned out to be.

It isn't anywhere near the worst movie in my collection.  I have movies I've never managed to sit through.  I made it through this one.

The acting is bad.  The dialog is bad.  The filming is bad.  The special effects bad.  I laughed a little, but not enough.

I'll probably watch it again just to inflict it on other people.",1360540800,,450,4.188235294117647

4709431,5,B005IGVTIS,"This is my first exposure to the genius of ""Bill Zebub,"" but it won't be my last.

Antfarm Dickhole should be required viewing by anyone crazy enough to get into ultra low budget filmmaking.

There is no acting, directing or photography to speak of, only a bunch of lumpy goth/metal type guys in their late 30s and plump stripper/groupie type girls in their early 20s saying and doing insane things for your amusement.

And in that regard, Antfarm Dickhole is a total success. It is constantly amusing, from start to finish.

The-- uhh-- plot--- is about a guy tormented by bullies who gets help from a colony of army ants that live in his urethra.

Many indie films have what is called ""sub-Kevin Smith dialogue.""  I'd describe what's in Antfarm Dickhole as ""super-Kevin Smith dialogue.""

Plus, I learned more in 90 minutes about the world of ants and the harmful effects of UV rays than I ever learned in seven years of high school.",1348704000,13,934,4.658536585365853

8474632,5,B005IGVTIS,"Bill Zeebub is one of my very guilty pleasures. His movies are hilarious but also a great inspiration to other true indie filmmakers. A couple of hand held cameras, a cheesy script, and zero budget goes a long way when you don't take yourself too serious as Bill doesn't. He does take his filmaking serious though.  This is what Bill wants to make, not what he has been told to make.  His style is do what you want and don't worry about what others think or what the end result will be. Have fun making your movie! He makes the movies he would watch. He makes the movies I like to watch. If you try to find redeeming qualities in Bill's movies you will fail, they do not exist. Sit back and have fun. Leave your fricking pretentious attitude out of it.  Antfarm is one of my favorite Bill Z movies thus far.",1396828800,4,807,4.261437908496732
