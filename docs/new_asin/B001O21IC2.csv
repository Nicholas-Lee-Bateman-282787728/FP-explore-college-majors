3726011,1,B001O21IC2,"The title of my review says it all.  This movie sucked!  I guess the reason there aren't any reviews for this movie is becuase everyone was smart enough not to watch it.  This movie had no plot and honestly i don't see the purpose of making this movie.  The worst part about this movie though would have to be the film quality itself.  I have no doubt in my mind that they did not just grab a camera and say lets go film some scenes, becuase that's what it is an overpriced home video.  So i recommend you do not waste your time or your money, like i unfortunately had.",1240012800,2,569,4.127272727272727
3726012,1,B001O21IC2,"Trying not to spoil it, but if I wanted to watch basketball, I would turn on the sports channel instead. The general pace of the movie was slow, and the plot disappointing. No real lesbian love scenes. No *really* good ending. Definitely short on entertainment value. I would buy this only if I had money to waste and time to waste watching it.",1271548800,,344,4.476190476190476
3726013,4,B001O21IC2,this movie is ok. i will probably watch it again and then give it to the neighbor.,1271203200,,82,3.8823529411764706
3726014,1,B001O21IC2,"This movie was painful. It was poorly written, poorly filmed, and poorly edited. It was slow moving, had weird, choppy sequences, and I caught myself laughing whenever the characters were upset/serious because it was so unbelievable. After seeing quite a few indi lesbian films, I feel my standards really aren't that high... but this movie was well below my meagar expectations.",1263168000,6,379,5.229508196721311
3726015,1,B001O21IC2,Really a bad movie (it's only my perception). This film is empty. I found absolutly no interest in this story. Nothing else to say. Just one thing : the audio was awfull,1259280000,3,169,4.3125
3726016,1,B001O21IC2,"I couldn't finish the movie. It attracts visually, but I felt as if I were seeing something home recorded. Didn't like the actors, either.",1258675200,,138,4.791666666666667
3726017,3,B001O21IC2,"The film was a gift and I finally watched it with a few friends and we had a great time. Was it the company or the film, not sure, but it was a nice little film, albeit low budget, that gave us a good night of hanging out.",1253145600,4,222,3.6458333333333335
3726018,2,B001O21IC2,"Making Maya was okay, I guess.  When it was over, all I could think of was Peggy Lee's song ""Is That All There Is?""",1252281600,3,115,3.7916666666666665
3726019,1,B001O21IC2,"this is a movie you watch when theres nothing else on,below average watching grass grow is more entertaining.",1251244800,2,109,5.111111111111111
3726020,5,B001O21IC2,Loved this film and really got into the story. Its an independent film and totally has that feel but it suprised me with a nice and well written story.  The actress did a great job and the basketball scenes were cool. I recommend it.,1241136000,11,233,4.295454545454546
3726021,4,B001O21IC2,"I actually liked this film. I thought it was a delicate piece that unravelled nicely. Oh, and the lead actress was really hot. This is an indie film with all the associated values, so if you're looking for a big budget flick with special effects, this might not be your thing. But if you enjoy character driven indies like I do, then its worth it.  PS, the kiss scene was interesting...",1241136000,13,386,4.436619718309859

8328906,3,B001O21IC2,"A highly talented female basketball player finds herself attracted to another female basketball player who belongs to a high school women's basketball team, and the two discover unaccountable feelings for one another, which leads the latter to leave her boyfriend in a movie that barely touches on the theme of lesbianism but merely hints on the subject matter that is never fully realized in a full-fledged lesbian drama.

If you're looking for movies along the same theme go instead for Blue is the Warmest Color and Q",1422489600,,520,4.977011494252873
8328907,5,B001O21IC2,it was a very good movie,1420675200,,24,3.1666666666666665
8328908,3,B001O21IC2,no,1410739200,,2,2.0
8328909,2,B001O21IC2,it didn't feel real enough for me acting was bad. Maya obviously a lesbian teen.having her first experience and it didn't happen. She ended up kissing the guy instead of a passionate kiss with her female co-star left you saying what the heck..writer needs to rewrite and make the movie again ..,1388966400,,294,4.673076923076923
8328910,1,B001O21IC2,If your looking to watch a nice lesbian love story this definitely isn't one of them don't waste your money I promise you'll regret buying it just like I did...,1361232000,,160,4.366666666666666
8328911,1,B001O21IC2,"This movie deserves a bullet, not a star...it was just bad.  Poorly acted and written.  I love and support Independent films and rarely am I as disappointed as I was by this one.",1302739200,,178,4.363636363636363
8328912,2,B001O21IC2,"This is a good little movie and it looked interesting by the cover and the overview of the story but this movie fell far short of my expectations. I've seen low budget films before and liked them. This movie however, wasn't acted well and the story was more a bi-curious tale. Needless to say, if I knew what the movie was like before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it. I'd recommend to rent this before owning it if you want to see it.",1295395200,2,441,4.2
8328913,2,B001O21IC2,"If you're looking for a film with some lesbian action then look no further than the cover. No, seriously, look no further than the cover of this dvd because it shows the only kiss in the whole movie. Don't get me wrong this movie isn't all bad, it was watchable and at the start it showed some real promise of development of something building. Then the kiss happens. Then nothing. What a let down. A rent-don't-buy movie.",1290816000,9,422,4.4935064935064934
