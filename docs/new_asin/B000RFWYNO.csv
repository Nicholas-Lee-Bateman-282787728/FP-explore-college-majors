2866741,4,B000RFWYNO,"Talk about false advertising. The cover of this DVD makes it look like a cheesy, exploitation revenge movie. It's not. The first two thirds of the film is actually a disturbingly realistic portrayal of the complete victimization of a person. Michelle is a shy, smart, attractive and poor girl who is sent to school in an affluent area in order to receive the educational benefits. She prefers reading alone to trying to compete with her rich, shallow classmates, until a charming athlete convinces her to go to a house party with the cool kids. By the end of the night Michelle is drugged, gang-raped, degraded and humiliated. Following the ordeal, everyone in her life, including her own mother, blames her for everything, and her reputation is destroyed.

There is nothing melodramatic about the way the film depicts Michelle's transformation from devastated victim to avenging assassin. And although the film ceases to be realistic when Michelle begins murdering both the boys who raped her and the girls who turned on her, it's satisfying.",1187049600,9,1043,5.063953488372093

2866743,5,B000RFWYNO,"For once, a indie horror has been made with a solid srcipt,cast and direction. It being a ""one by one"" revenge horror may sound old and tired but this one really pulls it off with style and wit. A horror with characters you identify with/feel for, what could be better than that?",1186358400,12,279,4.384615384615385
2866744,5,B000RFWYNO,"Bad Reputation is a strong and powerful first feature film by director and writer Jim Hemphill. While it follows a basic rape-revenge plot, it still feels fresh. As it begins, it feels like a teen romantic comedy, much like  She's All That (which is cleverly referenced by Aaron in the beginning of the film), but it progresses to become something much deeper and more terrifying than your average teen romp. The mood changes when Aaron and crew drug Michelle. From here on out, it's a horrifying, painful and downright satisfying film to watch.

The strong points in the film are the writing, acting and directing. The dialogue is realistic and intelligent, never insulting the viewers' intelligence. I love how clever references are featured, including an obvious nod to Jason of the Friday the 13th series in Michelle's revenge scenes. The characters are also developed quite well, and they never fall into the trap of becoming caricatures of high school students. You can actually make an emotional connection with each of them, which really affects how you view the film. You care about Michelle and want to see her get her revenge on all who have wronged her as much as you want to see those in the clique suffer. The direction ensured that the subject matter was not cheapened. This film has elements of Carrie, I Spit on Your Grave and May. Yet, Bad Reputation never rips these films off.

A stunning entry into the world of horror, Bad Reputation is one of the best independent films I've seen in a long time and proves that revenge is definitely sweet.

2866748,1,B000RFWYNO,"There's a fair number of people in this, which explains all their friends giving good reviews. This is garbage. They are trying to work a number of angles as it's basically a group of talentless 20-somethings playing teenagers, with a cellphone camera. Angle one is porn, this plays out like a bad 70's porn movie, however rape is not a subject for mainstream porn. Why it's in horror I don't know other than having to endure the insult to your intelligence is quite horrifying. Doesn't work as a revenge flick either, unless you think revenge for the rape and torture of a teenage virgin is having a pencil shoved up your butt. Trying to be clever when you're the exact opposite (a moron) doesn't work out well... if they had gone with having the girl go nuts with a chainsaw, shotgun, knife; pretty much anything that would have made it a ""revenge/horror"" flick would have been okay. This didn't, so aside from awful quality, your left watching a terrible crime to which there is no real revenge, not amusing at all...",1491609600,5,1020,4.640883977900552

The film was pretty sad up until the last 15 minutes. The dialogue and acting lacked. The sound wasn't top notch.

2866755,1,B000RFWYNO,"Hmm, funny how 4 of the 6 ""five star"" reviews for this were written in August of 2007...and the DVD was released that very month.  Either friends/family of the filmmakers, or they received free copies of the DVD and were asked (cajoled) into posting rave reviews (funny how people's opinions can be bought for something as cheap as a free DVD). Looking this up on Netflx you'll see the rating is a bit more believable--about 1 and three quarter stars (out of five).  I've always found DVDs that have a picture on the cover of someone who's not in the film all to be a good indicator of what kind of ordeal you're in for...",1339545600,,622,4.4
2866756,4,B000RFWYNO,"The title alone will conjure the Joan Jett song all on its own.  Of course this reviewer did not go into this film with eyes shut thankfully.  Yes yet another revenge film in the realms of I Spit on Your Grave.  So pack up your troubles and count your blessings this is Bad Reputation.

Arrrgh there be SPOILERS in these here waters...

Our story opens with the school outcast Michelle.  An attractive but shy girl that just wants to fit in with the cool kids and as luck would have it out of the blue star football player walks over and is above and beyond friendly with her.  He invites her to a huge party and tells her she would be missing out otherwise in a typical aloof manner.  Naturally she accepts and goes home to tell Mom who I swear was channeled from Carrie.  Still she was a bit calmer than Piper Laurie but that is like comparing getting hit in the head with a rock rather than ball bat. Mom gets told off and Michelle puts on her tart outfit and gets ready for a night of fun.  The first of the possible many rites of passage in teenage years when shock and gasp when she gets roofied and jocko offers her sweet words in private and looks to be a night of romance until...bum bum bum... yeah he and his two buddies start using her for the night.  Another gasp of pure disbelief that afterwards Jocko claims she came on to them and she loved every minute of it.  Quicker than you can say, ""What the hell?"" she is branded a slut by the school and the rumor mill starts kicking in.  Duct taped to a tree and labeled slut on her forehead I am sure Michelle was flashing back where the last couple of days all went wrong.  No sooner has the former Miss Goody Two Shoes tossed them and the kid gloves in one sitting...well maybe Carrie... or I Spit on Your Grave... or just about every other rape/revenge flick I have ever encountered.  Last House on the Left of course does not get that same billing.  Watch it if you have no clue what I am referring to.

Writer/Director Jim Hemphill first time at bat and on a meager budget attempts to pay homage to Carrie and I Spit on Your Grave at the same time.  The writing is solid, the dialogue is pretty dead on and frankly the story is bigger than the shoestring budget he had to work on.  Production managed very well we little to know twirly cam routine of the current horror movie caliber.  Channel the inner Roger Corman, Hemphill.  Keep the budget down.  You know, that is until you get the soulless producer that seems to create gold coins from his butt.

 This was not actually a bad film.  Granted in no way, shape or form was an original plot line but hell Hemphill tried to make it his own.  I feel with a bit more budget and little more stunt coordination this would have been a bit more realistic.  Obviously in this teen angst/revenge genre you have to suspend disbelief to a degree like gossip about a murder and who do you think would even have a reason to be responsible for such a horrific act of revenge.  Again you really cannot ask a slasher movie to be grounded in logic because people would never behave the way they do in horror movies of this sub-genre.  So for a first attempt I say well done Hemphill, I know now to avoid timid and demure little blondes that make have a savage streak in them.",1337817600,,3276,4.2727272727272725
2866757,4,B000RFWYNO,I really enjoyed this movie even though it is very low budget. It goes to show you that with the right direction a movie can be a lot of fun without being big budget. The main character does a really good job in this movie and you really do feel for her.  So when she goes on her rampage you love it. I was also impressed that a lot of the characters in this movie can act pretty well and could easily act in bigger budget movies which isn't always the case with B horror.  This is worth a watch- a fun way to spend an hour and half. 4/5,1272672000,,537,3.8727272727272726
2866758,4,B000RFWYNO,"I loved this movie, excellent plot with enough originality to make it it's own. Although the cinematography isn't amazing the acting, plot, and thrill make up for it. I highly recommend it.",1262649600,,189,4.9375
2866759,1,B000RFWYNO,"All I gotta say is NO ONE GETS NUDE IN THIS FILM! How can you make a rape-revenge film and no body bares skin? Not one white chick bares bush in this mess.

2866760,5,B000RFWYNO,"For the first movie by Jimmy Hemphill Bad Rep goes a long way.

Yes, this is an indie flick.  If you buy it expecting Carmen Electra in a nude scene and a cameo by Will Smith you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for something with fresh faces and casual killing, this is it.

I loved the movie and a quick internet search will show you that critics everywhere agree with me.",1197504000,,383,4.205479452054795
2866761,3,B000RFWYNO,"In the past I have been totally disappointed with horror films put out by Maverick, the distributor of this film...mainly because of the sucky acting and lack of story, but Bad Reputation delivered in those areas. I liked the acting, direction, and look and feel of the film, however it felt like what Hollywood would have done if they made a rape/revenge movie. It played everything safe...too safe. You cannot do that with this type of movie. You have to go all the way. It felt like an ABC after school special in some parts. The dialog and acting again were top notch, but when it came time for the lead character to get her revenge it fell short. If you want to see a real indy rape/revenge film that doesn't hold back, check out The Hood Has Eyez. That's a masterpiece in degenerate exploitation cinema.",1196812800,,809,4.5479452054794525

2866763,1,B000RFWYNO,"WARNING: This is an amateur film, shot on a digital camera. For a high school video project, it isn't bad. However, anyone expecting a professionally filmed & produced movie will be sadly disappointed. The cinematography is a joke. The acting is stilted and unnatural. The dialogue is dreadful. More time and skill went into producing the cover art than the actual product. Oh, and there's not even any gratuitous nudity to fast forward to.",1191369600,13,440,4.95945945945946
2866764,1,B000RFWYNO,"Poor quality, poor acting.  I don't know what else to say.  Evidently the people that made this have friend/family that like making reviews.

I love the movie ""May"", this sir is no ""May"".  I hate how people describe movies like this (bland, unimaginative dribble) with unique movies, with truely round characters, like ""May""  I mention ""MAy"" only because a previous reviewer chose to draw the comparison.

By the way, I don't know who that is on the cover, but she is not in the movie.  Some blond with the same outfit is.  It is amazing what 8 pounds of airbrush ink will do to a picture.  It sounds cruel, but I couln't help but to think about that the entire movie.  ??",1187654400,10,672,4.434426229508197

If it was a movie made by students I'd say kudos. But I couldn't get away from the feeling of a bad porn trying to have a plot &working hard to find good lines in the script. Sound bounced off the walls like a cheap porn. Sound EFFECTS  were fine. Makeups good. It wasn't over bloody, about just right amount.  Acting really wasn't that bad. (although the mother, was pretty bad). They had some iffy moments, but very good moments too. The filming/locations/sound made the acting seem worse than it was. The script, I can absolutely see teenagers talking like that. For the most part it was fairly realistic. Several scenes lasted way too long. We didn't need to see close up of her goalie mask for 2 min. 10 seconds would've been plenty. Several times I jumped ahead 10-60 seconds or more.
