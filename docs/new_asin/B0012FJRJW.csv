It is hard to find and generally isn't found in retail outlets. The movie is great and starts out humorously as Judith Helfland is joking with her parents about the vinyl siding they are about to install on their home. The movie does a great job of connecting the viewer with the family and helps draw personal investment to the detriment that vinyl causes, while at the same time giving pertinent, factual information in regards to the production and effects of Vinyl on the environment and people exposed to it. I definitely recommend the film for anyone who is interested in the world around us. It's too easy to forget that the things we use daily come at a cost, and at the very least it is all of our responsibility to understand the decisions we make are multi dimensional and effect more than just ourselves.",1301270400,,965,4.551724137931035
