8657301,4,B00KBERQR0,"This is a unique film. It says everything about being English - long winded, over formal, manner driven, righteous. It is also full of charm, wit and tongue twisting lines that makes the English the masters of historical films. The cast is small, the setting is an island, the sun always seems to shine, nothing really happens, it is all so Shakespearean. The performance of old Hemlock by Chris Bearne is just simply excellent, as are those of his three daughters. It was a delight to watch. I sat back and did not have to worry about a thing for ninety minutes. Pure escapism, pure bliss",1415750400,,589,4.566037735849057
