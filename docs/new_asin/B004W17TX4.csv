8444263,4,B004W17TX4,"The quality of the film was fair.  Sometimes the sound and captions skipped.  I realize the film was made in 1937, but many films have been digitized in order to improve the quality.
Other than that, I enjoyed watching the film.  I have been a big fan of the star of the film (Moishe Oysher) and his marvelous voice for many years.",1396396800,3,331,4.306451612903226
