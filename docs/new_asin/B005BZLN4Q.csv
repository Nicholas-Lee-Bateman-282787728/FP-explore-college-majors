8464679,5,B005BZLN4Q,Anyone writing a review to complain about the Christian point of view obviously hasn't realized that is exactly the purpose of the series about The Holy Land and the Ancient World. This host is a Christian and comes to this series to discuss the archeological discoveries that prove Biblical Scripture. That is what makes this series so very special. He does exactly what he sets out to do and makes it inspiring and interesting!,1426636800,5,429,4.8108108108108105

My complaint is the pervasive pro-Christian bias that comes through in almost every program. Biblical statements are accepted without question, and the viewpoints of other people and civilizations are downgraded.

I get that some Christians want to see all of history as merely leading toward the perfection of the Gospel, but that's a bad starting point for writing history. And in the case of this seriesat least the several episodes I've seen on Netflixthere's nothing to hint that this bias is going to be there throughout.",1389657600,,725,5.033333333333333
