5462895,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"This is your typical heart warming amusing feel good indie flick starring indie perennial favorite Anna Paquin as Katherine. Long lost ""white trash Uncle"" Scott(Ryan Phillippe) rides in one day on a horse to greet his sister-in-law and former girlfriend. He obeys the indie formula and immediately bonds with his nephew and niece.  He claims he is being guided by visions of his dead mother to come back and make amends...a man who has spent the bulk of the last eight years in a mental institution for substance abuse. Chaos erupts and from chaos comes order.

The script is somewhat formulaic with a slight twist on the end. Good acting, slow at times.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Paquin in a sexy sando shirt showing side breast, cleavage and high beams. Personally my low brow tastes liked ""Uncle Buck"" better. Worth a rental.",1365206400,7,846,4.820689655172414
5462896,5,B00AO7HQ9M,I liked this movie very much.  Really some great acting.  The ending was totally different than the way I thought it would end.,1364774400,3,127,4.478260869565218
5462897,5,B00AO7HQ9M,Very good movie and acting. Not predictable which is a must for me!!  Highly recommend this movie for date night,1364688000,3,112,4.6
5462898,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"""Mom told me to come."" After his mother tells him to visit the family he abandoned, Scott (Phillippe) surprises his sister in law (Paquin) and her kids. Decidind to wait for his brother to come home Scott stays and begins to form a relationship with Katherine's kids in spite of her requests. When Scott begins to act like his old self she wants him out, but he is determined to listen to his mother's advice...even though she is dead. I know what your thinking, a man hears his dead mother and listens, that can't make a good movie. You would be wrong. The acting in this is really good, but the story of each character is so well written and thought out that it really makes the movie that much more enjoyable. 99% of movies like this are very predictable and for the most part this one is too, but there is a twist in this I did not see coming, which also adds to the enjoyment of the movie. This is a surprise sleeper that is very much worth seeing. I recommend. Overall, a little low budget movie that proves good movies can be made with a good script. I give it a B+.",1360281600,19,1073,4.239024390243903

5462903,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"i bought this movie from the dollar store so I didn't think it would be a good movie but because I like anna paquin in true blood I figured why not .. I loved this movie I don't know how I didn't own this before.. it had such great characters, handsome men , great storyline.. I would def tell all my friends they should see this movie if not put it in your collection like I own.. its def worth it",1405987200,,398,3.925925925925926
5462904,2,B00AO7HQ9M,Would you like to waste your time? Go and watch this film. Bunch of great actors are playing in the poor director's ambition and primitive screenplay.,1386979200,,150,4.8076923076923075
5462905,3,B00AO7HQ9M,"""Straight A's"" was interesting enough to hold my attention, but not interesting enough that I would watch it again or recommend it to others. I like Luke Wilson and Anna Paquin, but they didn't have much screentime together, and Luke Wilson was especially one-note--a husband who's tired of his life, and doesn't feel that guilty for it (or for being absentee to avoid it).

The story is straightforward--deadbeat Scott, full of life but struggling with addiction, returns to his hometown to make amends with his brother, father, and ex-girlfriend (who just happened to marry his brother). He can't quite overcome his demons and throws the house into chaos, simultaneously managing to be likeable and frustrating. There's lots of emotion, some setbacks, and then at the end a twist that perhaps is supposed to make the viewer sad but ultimately fails, because you just don't really care what happens to the characters.

I think maybe with more attention paid to the relationship between the brothers, and more focus on the failing marriage, it would have greatly improved the plot--as it is, a ""love triangle"" is fairly tepid when there's no suspense about who ends up with who.",1386720000,3,1178,5.005102040816326
5462906,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"A great story that had a lot of heart...questions and a surprise twist ending.  I  thought the direction was unusually good...as was the acting of Fillippi and the children.  Paquin's performance had the right amount of ""being torn and good decisions""
I love this ""little"" film...bought it to see again at will.  Tender pathos and it made me cry....always a good thing!  James Cox should exercise his great skills on more of this ""simplicity genre""!",1382054400,,449,4.933333333333334
5462907,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"I loved the film. A story of redemption, with nice, charismatic performances and some really sweet scenes with those kids!",1380326400,,122,5.15
5462908,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"We've seen this before. A seemingly stable household becomes disrupted when a black sheep relative or friend makes an unscheduled appearance. This might not be the best of the lot buts it's watchable and entertaining.

Here's the scoop. William (Luke Wilson) is in the high-level real estate game. His wife Katherine (Anna Paquin) does the society thing in and around town while distancing herself from her two young children, both who have issues. William's black-sheep brother Scott (Ryan Phillippe) rides up on a horse with a boatload of booze and pills and turns everything topsy turvy. But, in his own way he reveals to them they may have a good lifestyle but they're far from having good lives.

I can't say there are a lot of surprises here. You see the set-up early on and you're pretty well assured where things are headed. A few things do happen that are unexpected but nothing that alters the destination. What is going on here is the acting. Luke Wilson has a natural presence in front of the camera and he's decent here as is Anna Paquin. The big surprise for me was Ryan Phillippe. I'm not a big fan of his which almost caused me to pass this one by, but, for my dollar, he was what was happening here. The way he stands, walks, his voice and his southern accent all add up to a really good character. This is shot well with some nice scenes showing the Northern Louisiana bayou area. It has decent production values for an indy film and it sports a nice musical score.

This isn't quite worth the 4 stars I gave it, mostly due to its derivative nature. But they play the cards well enough entertain their audience.",1379980800,2,1629,4.552901023890785
5462909,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"This is a cute movie--nothing too profound or earth-shattering, but good, relaxing entertainment. Luke Wilson is always delightful, as is Anna Paquin, and Ryan Phillipe is a surprisingly competent actor. Enjoyed it very much. And thank you, Amazon, for closed captioning!",1377648000,2,271,5.634146341463414
5462910,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"I wasn't expecting much when I rented this, but it was actually a good movie. A twist I did not expect and a lot of emotion. I definitely recommend this movie.",1375920000,2,159,4.161290322580645
5462911,2,B00AO7HQ9M,The movie was a little slow I thought and overall not very exciting or memorable. The actors were good but the story wasn't that great,1375142400,3,134,4.4
5462912,5,B00AO7HQ9M,Ryan Phillippe was extraordinary in this movie. I had no idea how great he is. I knew he was married to Reese Witherspoon years ago but beyond that I had not seen him. He is captivating in this movie. I saw it on Netflix and came right to Amazon to order it after viewing it. I loved it.,1374969600,,287,3.9655172413793105
5462913,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"This movie is not a romantic comedy - it's a deeper story. It's a story about a woman who had to choose between two brothers who loved her. She chose the responsible older brother after the younger brother - her first love - took off without saying goodbye leaving her devastated. The older brother - Luke Wilson - stepped in and married her as he wanted her the moment his younger brother brough her home. That's the subtext of the movie.

Fast forward 10 years later and the younger brother shows up at their doorstep out of the blue after spending 10 years in and out of rehab. Her marriage is in a bad place - she's disconnected from her husband and children. She's wondering why he came and we're wondering if she'll run off with him.",1374624000,,739,4.394160583941606
5462914,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"I had no idea what this movie was about.  I had not ever heard of it.  After reading a few reviews on IMDB, I decided to order it on Amazon.  Although a used 'rental', it and the sleeve came in almost perfect condition.  The movie's storyline was very good and I loved it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1372723200,,312,4.133333333333334
5462915,4,B00AO7HQ9M,Most people are not able to reconcile the drifts. The cast was excellent. The ending was very sad but also hopeful. It is not a movie for mindless entertainment - it requires some thinking.,1372032000,,189,4.588235294117647
5462916,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"A bit predictable until the ending. The story keeps us wondering, will she or won't she go for the bad boy brother-in-law whom she once loved. Great secondary characters.",1369440000,2,170,4.896551724137931
5462917,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"The film focuses on the relationships of a family - two brothers and their shared love interest, their forgetful father, and the legacy of their mother.

It's been years since I've seen a movie with Ryan Phillippe that I would watch and this is one.  Luke Wilson has always been a favorite of mine.  And Anna Paquin has always been an actress that I've wavered whether I love or dislike her.  The casting was perfectly done.

Ryan as the irresponsible, wandering brother - the black sheep of the family who's been gone for 8+ years.  Luke as the perfect husband/provider (the opposite of his brother) who is contemplating divorcing his wife.  And lastly, Anna as the woman who has loved both brothers.  At first, the younger one Scott and after he left due to a fallout with his father; then she fell for William.

Katherine and William have a marriage that is perfect on the outside; not so much on the inside.  Katherine is too busy to spend time with her children or family.  Instead, the duties of child-rearing and caring for the house are foisted onto a maid.  William is always out of town, a fact that is recognized by Katherine's ""so-called"" friends.

When Scott shows up after a long absence, he turns their world inside out and manages to bring Katherine, William, and their children back together.  Be prepared to shed a few tears at the end.",1369353600,2,1354,4.610878661087866
5462918,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"I rented this with pretty low expectations.  I hadn't heard of it and the last few films I've seen with Anna Pacquin have been pretty bad, but I was hoping Ryan Phillippe would at least look better in the film than he does on the cover.  There was something absolutely charming about Ryan and the two children actors and Anna and Ryan look beautiful on screen together.  This certainly wasn't a great film, but it was enjoyable to watch (I'll be honest I fast forwarded through Luke Wilson) and it had a fantastic soundtrack.",1368921600,2,525,4.5638297872340425
5462919,4,B00AO7HQ9M,"Entertaining at the least. It could have been a lot worse but I don't want to under rate it because it was ""different"" and I'd like to see more from these two guys.",1368921600,,164,4.0
5462920,3,B00AO7HQ9M,Not anything that I would watch again.  Just an ok movie.  Guy goes back and tries to work out relationships with his family.  He does.  Connects with his son.  Makes an impact on his life and well... the end.,1368576000,2,209,4.256410256410256
5462921,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"The poster makes it seem like ""Straight A's"" is a romantic comedy. It's not. It's a drama through and through -- an in-depth character study of a woman (Anna Paquin) whose life is pretty much turned upside-down as her brother-in-law (Luke Wilson) (and former lover) waltzes back into her life when her husband is out of town. In any other movie, that premise would be a recipe for Paquin's character to leave her lifeless marriage for Wilson -- but the writers thankfully strayed away from that scenario, one that would have emotionally scarred Paquin's two young children beyond repair. It's implied (via a dead mother's journal) that Wilson is the father of Paquin's oldest child, but thankfully the movie spends no time on it -- it comes up in one sentence and that's it.
""Straight A's"" is sentimental, but the writers resisted the temptation to make it overly so. It's a great film to watch.",1368230400,2,895,4.780645161290322
5462922,5,B00AO7HQ9M,"This movie had it all. A little bit of sadness, romance, and humor. Ryan had me laughing at the character he had to portray. Suitable only for adults.",1367712000,,150,4.392857142857143
5462923,4,B00AO7HQ9M,It was so different than I thought it was going to be. But that's what made this movie so good because you didn't know what was going to happen.,1367020800,,144,4.0
5462924,2,B00AO7HQ9M,Not a bad movie... but I can't recommend it.  The Phillipe character cursed too much - in a non-flowing inappropriate way... so it was awkward.,1366502400,,143,4.72
5462925,3,B00AO7HQ9M,"acting was okay, storyline was okay but the whole thing together was just okay. I wouldn't recommend it unless you can't find anything else to watch.",1366329600,2,149,4.769230769230769
5462926,2,B00AO7HQ9M,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did!.  I love Anna Paquin, Ryan Phillipe, and Luke Wilson, but what seemed like a light enjoyable slice of life love story suddenly ended in tragedy.  Why does Hollywood feel they must offer viewers a gratuitous kill? To satisfy a morbid curiosity?  I, along with most people I know, don't need this unnecessary death. This movie could have been so much better if Luke Wilson had stayed away 'cause even after he came home, they failed to convince me that he really wanted to be there. Ryan Phillipe was full of obnoxious fun, sure, and he needed to grow up, but he didn't' need to, out of the blue, go into a coma from a brain tumor and die.  Come on powers that be,  just just give us a slightly complicated love story and end it at that!  PLEASE?",1365811200,,787,4.319727891156463
5462927,3,B00AO7HQ9M,Good heart warming movie the entire family can enjoy! Better than regular tv but not exactly blockbuster movie  so watch it at home for an enjoyable family night!,1365724800,,162,4.785714285714286
5462928,3,B00AO7HQ9M,"Anna Paquin unconvincingly portrays a well-off Southern Mom and wife estranged from her husband, played by Luke Wilson.  While she seems the raison d'etre of the film, the love, first and true, of two brothers, the fly in the ointment lost soul of a brother played by Ryan Phillippe adding tension to the mild estrangement of the husband and wife, no character portrays a complete personality.  Instead, predictable stereotypes seem to direct the plot.  Anna's portrayal is brittle and bristling as though she is playing AT a person instead of IN the character.  This greatly detracts from the entire film.

The bright lights are the children, mysterious and surprising, accepting of the unconventional which their parents stridently reject.  The ending seems artificial, a twist to remove the unrequited love of the lost brother for the solid renewal of the Luke Wilson/Anna Paquin marriage.  In total, interesting but not compelling enough to recommend to friends and family.",1365724800,3,977,5.2243589743589745
