8345457,1,B001V5K3TQ,"This was hands down the worst video I have ever seen! I can forgive the poor camera quality, but the man on the tape giving massage gave the worst demos. There was no real explanation of anything. He was monotone and there didn't seem to be any sort of plan as to order and sequence. It was a train wreck that I couldn't turn away from. There was no attention to the qulity of touch, the ethics of touch or injury awareness. I could write pages on what was wrong with this video, but I am holding myself back as I hear my mom's voice ringing ,""If you don't have anything nice to say.....""

Do NOT purchase this video!!!!!!",1281916800,4,622,4.226890756302521

Having a full DVD purely on Stretching is fantastic and I found this particular one very helpful and usable. Definitely worth the money.",1271462400,,246,4.744186046511628
8345459,5,B001V5K3TQ,This video is excellent.  It's very obvious the narrator knows his stuff.  The narration and video angles were right on.  I've used some of the stretches in the past and I've learned some new ones to try out on some of my clients.  I have shared this video with colleagues and am recommending them to purchase their own.,1241395200,2,320,4.4655172413793105
