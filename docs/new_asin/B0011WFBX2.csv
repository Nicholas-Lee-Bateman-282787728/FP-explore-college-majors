8242809,3,B0011WFBX2,"This is three small adventures. One adventure has Pompeii at its historic end and one has Paul Revere's historic ride both in danger of being ruined. You can have 72 minutes of history as seen by 4 young kids sent through time to save their teacher. This does not have much in the way of violence, far less than most modern comics. I was hoping more would be out soon so far this is it.
The back reads :
For the Adventurers, danger is a thing of the present...
as the Masters of Time, the present is a thing of the past. Uploading themselves by way of time continuum software, the fabulous four are suddenly whisked back through the ages on a desperate search for their missing computer professor. Unfortunately, they haven't made the journey alone. An evil Hacker and his insidious Virtual Agents are threatening to change world history forever.
