4219139,5,B003Y5H1WS,"I'm recovering from a severe case of Achilles tendonitis and have been forbidden by my doctor to do any exercise that involves weight-bearing on my feet, including my usual yoga class.  Since I rely on my yoga practice for stress relief in addition to developing and maintaining flexibility and strength, I've been going a bit crazy without my yoga.  Totally Chair Yoga to the rescue!  I feel well-stretched and simultaneously relaxed and energized after doing this video.  Thank you so much for creating this program.",1404172800,7,518,5.0588235294117645

4219142,1,B003Y5H1WS,I have been in a wheelchair for 5 years. I have tried many type of media exercise formats. I found this to be too fast and too difficult. It is also oddly structured in that there is no warm up and the warnings about overdoing it are not at the beginning.,1354752000,5,255,4.019607843137255
4219143,4,B003Y5H1WS,"I loved this video and felt great after doing it. My only suggestion, and why I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars, is to add a bit more leg stretching/exercises. I felt great from the waist up but felt the legs were lacking a bit. The instructor is soothing and clearly knows what she is doing.",1354147200,2,290,4.105263157894737
4219144,5,B003Y5H1WS,This is the perfect Chair Yoga for those who can not get on the floor or who have limited mobility. This DVD will not disappoint. Kimberlee guides you through a series of Chair Yoga positions which gently strech your body while you focus on your breathing. I highly reommend this DVD,1330646400,8,283,4.568627450980392

4219153,2,B003Y5H1WS,"Totally Chair Yoga with Kimberlee Bethany did not offer what I  expected.  In fact I was very very disapointed. Also, for what the price of the DVD, I expected much much more.",1434153600,,175,4.4375
4219154,5,B003Y5H1WS,Has been great for me as I can't do the floor exercises any longer.,1433894400,4,67,3.857142857142857
4219155,3,B003Y5H1WS,"Was a little disappointed in this, don't care for her style and it's predominantly stretches.  Just ok",1433462400,3,102,5.0
4219156,4,B003Y5H1WS,Kimberlee gives a perceptive class.  Has a good grasp of the body and mind connection.  I enjoy her directions and demonstrations very much.  I wish the record was a bit longer.,1429920000,2,177,4.645161290322581

4219158,5,B003Y5H1WS,Excellent chair yoga! I have a muscular disease which has weakened my legs and I have a loss of balance so I was looking for an all chair yoga video. This video works out the entire body in just over a half hour.,1425945600,5,212,3.953488372093023

4219160,5,B003Y5H1WS,I purchased this DVD for our chair yoga group and all the participants LOVE it. The poses are challenging (we are all older folks) and the pacing is excellent. Everyone comments how much better they feel after our sessions (twice a week).,1408752000,8,238,4.690476190476191
8408679,5,B003Y5H1WS,"A great option to those with knee or leg problems.  You still have to work, but you don't have to bear weight on your legs while doing these positions.",1527638400,,151,4.206896551724138
8408680,4,B003Y5H1WS,"I have arthritis in most of my joints including my back and I cannot get on the floor or stand for any period of time. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to do this tape as I have tried others, but this one was totally a series done sitting down. Maybe it won't give me what yoga can give a more able body person but I am getting the benefits of stretching, breathing and of being able to move my body.  Good tape for those that have many limitations.",1526860800,,448,3.977777777777778

8408687,5,B003Y5H1WS,"Many so-called chair exercise videos are not all seated, but this video is. It's not all yoga-like, but that's because it's basically impossible in a chair. It has been great for me, with longstanding serious foot pain, to have a fully seated video offering. Thank you, Dr. Bonura. Would love if you could make a cardiovascular chair workout and/or a chair workout with the addition of weights.",1456012800,4,394,4.895522388059701
8408688,5,B003Y5H1WS,This is an excellent video for those of us with impaired mobility. The instructions are clear and the pace is soothing. I will be including this in my fitness regime.,1444867200,,166,4.566666666666666
