4896535,3,B005V3XD64,"My fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has provided enough detail about this film - and thoughtfully - did not give away the ending. I concur 100% with K that, while Huppert is the reason to see the film, it's the writer/director's fault that the film doesn't gel.

One thing not pointed out yet is the DVD includes an ""Interview"" with Director Jeanne Labrune, which is a TEXT interview about the film and it's characters. In some screens the print may be a bit small to read. Labrunne comes across - at least for me - as defensive in her feelings re: Psychoanalysts and the fees they charge.

I hope this adds some helpful information.

8487278,5,B005V3XD64,"This excellent film offers a sensitive, low-key portrayal by Isabelle Huppert of a high-class prostitute, who wants to get out of her profession. Along the way --besides offering a superb human drama-- the film also offers interesting questions about the similarities between therapy and prostitution.
Though the write-up calls this a 'dark' film, I would describe it more as a sober film mixed with gentleness and affection. (Advisory note to anyone looking for violent action or explicit sex featuring beautiful, young bodies: please spend your money on another film.) Top-notch supporting cast. As always the French deliver a first-rate production mixing classy style and naughtiness, along with giving you something to think about. Ignore any reviews calling this a second-rate film. It is first-rate, that is, if you love solid drama, wonderful, sensitive acting, and thought-provoking themes. Looking for overt x-rated sex and violence? Go elsewhere.",1520640000,,956,5.554794520547945
8487279,5,B005V3XD64,"Oustanding delicate and touching movie from the French Cinema. This one made me stick my eyes and ears to the screen.

8487280,5,B005V3XD64,"Isabelle Huppert takes chances  and does so here playing one of two lost souls, in parallel professions and crises.

8487281,5,B005V3XD64,"Maybe I like foreign films because of the qualities I found here.  So much going on and so understated.
