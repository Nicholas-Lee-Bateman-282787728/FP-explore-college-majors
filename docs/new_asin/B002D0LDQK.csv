8364684,1,B002D0LDQK,"I am a little dispapointed. I can believe you are selling a cheesy copy of an old german classic movie like this. Yes it is in english, but the picture quality is very bad.",1339804800,,172,4.088235294117647
8364685,1,B002D0LDQK,"The movie is great. This DVD is a copy of the video tape. The quality, however, is terrible especially if watched on an HD TV. You can clearly tell it is a copy of a video tape because of the lines on the bottom of the screen. Furthermore this is full screen (4:3) while the original movie was made in 2.35:1 format. I am wondering why amazon.com is selling this copy of the movie while Amazon.de is selling a pristine Blu-Ray copy of the movie in English (or in German with English subtitles) which plays on American Blu-Ray players. Furthermore, the copy sold on Amazon.de is in 2.35:1 format which is the format of the original movie.",1279152000,16,637,4.452991452991453
