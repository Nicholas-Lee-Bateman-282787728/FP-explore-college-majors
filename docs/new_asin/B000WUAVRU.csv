8225707,5,B000WUAVRU,"I love studying history but had never delved into this particular subject before. I watched most of this series on The History Channel and ended up taking pages & pages of notes! But I missed the one episode I was most interested in, the one covering the 19th Century,so I was glad to find the entire series at a very reasonable price at amazon and added it to my home library. It is full of surprises! (We think of The Victorians as uptight and prudish, while they were anything but!) What took place in the 1960's was NOT the first ""sexual revolution"" by any means, and you will have to take notes if you want to remember much of this detailed and interesting history: attitudes & morals have been ever-changing, swinging from one extreme to the other and back again & again over several centuries. I found it fascinating, and topics such as birth control, family planning, and views of women's roles are covered throughout. As a dabbling writer of historical fiction I want to be accurate in all aspects of life in any given time period, and this series is an excellent resource on this topic. There is nothing obscene, offensive, or too graphic in its content and there is a good amount of humor to keep it from being too clinical. The mellow voice of Peter Coyote makes for easy listening during several hours of this informative, fascinating history class!",1296086400,2,1362,4.632231404958677
