8053429,5,B0007XG18U,"Back in the early fifties,I remember going to the local movie theater and watching Roy Rogers movies for a dime. Those were great childhood memories and now I can watch all of his great westerns again. The Great American Western series is a forty dvd set and I've put together a complete set. There are dvds of Gene Autry,Randolph Scoot,Joel McCrae,Lee Van Cleef,just to name a few. Buy any of the forty dvds,or all of them,sit back and enjoy.",1355788800,,443,4.620253164556962
