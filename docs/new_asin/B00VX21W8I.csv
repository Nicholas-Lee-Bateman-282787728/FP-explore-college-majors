8711583,5,B00VX21W8I,"3-disc set, with 1 & 2 my personal faves because all the episodes were made in the great 1950's! The kids weren't quite as old and hormone-bound yet, and life was simpler. So simple in fact that their home didn't even have a bathroom, but they got by somehow. For wholesome fun and entertainment, you can't beat this long-running series. Long-running because people loved and related to this REAL family, and IMO, stood a very good chance of growing up to be better people because of all the wonderful and genuine role modeling that took place week after week and year after year without fail. Today's television.....argh! Don't get me started!

Take a trip back in time.....a more civilized time.",1443225600,8,697,4.808333333333334

8711585,5,B00VX21W8I,"If you like black and white TV, good, wholesome entertainment, these DVDs are for you. Shows from this time frame reflect a totally different perspective on life and how it was lived. Disks arrived in good condition. There are 3 with multiple shows on each did.",1439337600,3,261,4.695652173913044
8711586,5,B00VX21W8I,"Are such sweet family entertainments gone forever??  Even LOST IN SPACE became a Major Motion Picture full of nasty disgusting kids.  Please, Hollywood, don't even try to update (i.e. screw up) Ozzie & Harriet.",1438300800,4,210,5.147058823529412
