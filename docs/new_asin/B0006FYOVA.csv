2183163,5,B0006FYOVA,"If you thought Philadelphia, The 12 Monkeys and Tradin' Places were the only films other than The Philadelphia Experiment set in Philly, you're dead wrong.
When it comes to grittyness, this early '70s film, which appears to be shot mostly in West Philly puts NYC to shame.... in terms of charactor and story development its also definitely *not* your typical blaxploitation film - - and this becomes clear the moment you realize that its actually an adaptation of a novel by Iceberg Slim, a writer who along with Donald Goines wrote about urban street life and told tales of hustlers and pimps long long before Shaft and Superfly.  In fact, it was probably the realism of their books most likely that fueled the fantasy of that film genre....
The story is about the final days of a relationship between an aging hustler named Blue and his young counterpart/protege known as ""White Folks"" so named because he can pass for white, a bend which made their game all the more strong.  While hated by most black folks because he looks like a white man, he is understood and protected by Blue  - - and together their hustle and schemes seem almost righteous, because through Folks, Blue is able to engage in confidence games praying on greedy white people who believe they are about to get rich by exploiting black folk.  Far from being jive talking hustlers, both are articulate and intelligent and have learned well from one another, making their game even stronger, til one day they hustle the wrong person putting a dirty cop and the mob on their tale, in the middle of the biggest hustle of their lifetime.  Suddenly, its a race against time and the questions whether its time to get out of town or get out of the game.
Great film, great locations, well acted, and a nice bluesy soundtrack.  If you like this film, check out the novel by Slim, as well ""Across 110th Street"" another interesting movie about the relationship between an idealistic young black cop and corrupt old guard white cop, and missing mob money in Harlem.",981936000,58,2023,4.700564971751413

2183171,5,B0006FYOVA,"I love movies especially Blaxploitation movies as they are called because of the time frame in the 1970's and the black actors who starred in these movies. Trick Baby is a story about a old black con man named Blue Howard and a young white con named Johnny O'Brien called ""folks"" by his friends and ""Trick Baby"" but his enemies. Johnny has a secret that his white ""friends"" or should I say cons don't know. He is actually black but passing himself off as white. I wasn't sure what Trick Baby meant until it was explained in the movie by Johnny O'Brien to his white girlfriend that he came out of a black woman and his father is a white john.

Traditionally, Blacks passing themselves off as white is a typical story that can be contrived and boring but I was not bored watching Trick Baby. I don't want to give away the entire plot of the movie but I found myself cheering for Blue and Folks as they conned people out of their money. I know that seems bad but the action and pace of the movie helped me to enjoy and understand why they did what they did.",1430870400,,1054,4.27
2183172,2,B0006FYOVA,The DVD skipped in places and pix-elated in spots. I was wondering if the copy I purchased was a boot leg copy. I don't suggest purchasing from this company again. I doubt if I can get my money back since I didn't immediate watch it.,1409097600,,233,4.2

2183176,3,B0006FYOVA,"Nevertheless I'd watch it again, it showcased a lot of subliminal messages and scenarios regarding the tricks and trades of life, especially regrading living in a melting pot society. I gave it 3-Stars because I'm a Verne Watson fan, although the ending of the movie was like ""WTH?"" Really! LOL",1363392000,,294,4.9
2183177,4,B0006FYOVA,"I was surprised to see that other user reviews were so different in their reactions to this film than me. They compared the movie to The Sting and Blacksploition films. Trick Baby is not The Sting or Cotton Comes to Harlem. There are no Robin Hoods stealing from bad people to the benefit of good people. It is not entertainment. It is horror. The movie is like the book by Iceberg Slim. The book was horrifying because the author told the story without any moral comment, just laying it out matter-of-factly as though this world of crime and vice and universal dishonestly was not a pathological mutation of everything that is decent and honorable. Trick Baby is like exploratory surgery on a patient that is still alive but already decaying from within. Everybody in the story parasitises everybody else. And they are Black. Is this grifter world the natural result of racist oppression so that the only path to prosperity is to cheat and steal and whore? Or did other victimized people take strength from self-help and being morally superior to their oppressors? Here we see Black-on-Black exploitation at its worst. And in the end the moral of the amoral story is the same as in Public Enemy where Cagney's corpse is delivered to his mother in the last scene. Crime doesn't pay.",1315267200,3,1282,4.753363228699552
2183178,3,B0006FYOVA,"I am a lover of old flicks... anything that is mentioned in other movies, shown on other films, CD-interludes, Samples, etc..

IE.. watching TRICK BABY.. i've heard a sample that was used in a Wu-Tang song.

good movie",1313452800,,218,4.7105263157894735
2183179,5,B0006FYOVA,All I can say is great movie.  One of my top 5 best blax. movies,1228348800,,64,3.2666666666666666
2183180,4,B0006FYOVA,if you dig Iceburg slim and Donald Goines then you are gonna be feeling this  film. a Brother who can Pass for White and a Older soul Brother who has Schooled the Younger Cat on the Street Hustle in Philly. there are so many twists and turns in this film and the Big Heist near the end makes you wonder can they make it back to the Bank in time? if this Film was Up-dated it would be outta control on the Real. the soundtrack was tight as well. the Preacher had me rolling as well. i was feeling that Hog in the Film. right on that film will take you back and make you think and this is the kind of film that had so much cleaverness going on it wasn't even funny. that toliet paper roll  that passed for dollar bills would make Sheryl Crow even squeeze the charmin.,1178409600,,765,4.059602649006623
2183181,4,B0006FYOVA,"I wanted to read the book, but it's always checked out so I decided I might as well watch the movie. It was pretty good, despite the unhappy ending. But that's real life though. The characters were sophisticated and knew how to carry out their hustles, even though in the end Blue was too obsessed with the money and lost focus. Other than that, there was none of that sloppy, ill-mannered, dumb thug stuff that seems to be popular these days. I really love movies from the 1970s and this one will definetly be added to my collection.",1177891200,,534,4.459183673469388
2183182,3,B0006FYOVA,"The story is that of two con-men: White Folks (Kiel Martin), who had a black mother and a white father and whose skin is white; and Blue Howard ( Mel Stewart), a grizzled black veteran who has taught his young protg everything he knows about the art of dishonest tricks...

Together they cheat the Mafia and the police; they make $10,000 and have to give some of it away to the local black protection retailer; they set up a confidence property deal to get by fraud some over-greedy white businessmen out of $150,000, but cannot quite shield the stolen loot...

The distinguished trait of the film is that not all the blacks are all good, and not all the whites are all bad... What is more, it makes a point of showing that black men can play on their color to win their own ends...",1168819200,,782,4.386206896551724
2183183,3,B0006FYOVA,I was sadden by the fact that the movie seemed to be incomplete.  I recently compared the movie to the book and everything in the movie seems to be in the first two chapters.,1162512000,3,174,4.117647058823529
