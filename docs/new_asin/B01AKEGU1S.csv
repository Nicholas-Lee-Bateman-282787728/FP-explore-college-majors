7606147,5,B01AKEGU1S,Great movie. Especially the mailman in the last scene.,1461283200,3,54,5.111111111111111
7606148,3,B01AKEGU1S,dorky in certain scenes but overall good enough to watch all the way through -- plot choppy/cheesy; Travolta was great though,1461196800,,125,5.0
7606149,5,B01AKEGU1S,"I loved this movie, it has good action, has a story and a meaning.  John Travolta is one of the best.  If you like action and Travolta this is your movie!",1461196800,10,154,3.935483870967742
7606150,1,B01AKEGU1S,Are you joking? Travolta is the ugliest cross-dresser in this movie I've ever seen. No one would buy he's a woman like all the characters seemed to.,1461024000,3,148,4.518518518518518
7606151,1,B01AKEGU1S,"Pedestrian and thoroughly predictable action movie with John Travolta as a man who witnesses his wife murdered by street thugs in what appears to be a random act of violence, although it won't be a surprise to anyone with half a brain that the killing wasn't actually random at all.  Travolta positively identifies one of the killers in a police lineup but it turns out the man is untouchable--so why was he in the lineup in the first place?  To move the plot forward, of course!  After the police let the man walk despite being identified in the lineup Travolta, who conveniently turns out to have some black ops work buried in his past, decides to seek vengeance with the help of an old service buddy played by Christopher Meloni.

Travolta looks pretty good, for whatever that's worth, but this movie is lame.  The plotting is dumb.  The action is not exciting.  The movie plods along like the bottom feeding straight-to-video dreck that it is.  I Am Wrath probably wants to be Travolta's Taken but it can't even muster up the skill to be a decent Death Wish wannabe.  If you have to see everything that John Travolta is in--I Am Wraith is something that John Travolta is in--but, honestly, even crappy straight to video action movies starring the wrestlers of WWE tend to be more lively and entertaining than this.",1460764800,10,1318,4.670995670995671
7606152,4,B01AKEGU1S,"Vivian Hill (Rebecca De Mornay) works crunching numbers for the governor of Ohio. The crime rate is down everywhere except for the city of Columbus. Car Manufacture manager Stanley Hill (John Travolta) flies home to Ohio from a job interview. His wife gets toasted in the parking garage, in a city where we have been told, ""nothing's random."" After identifying the culprit in a police line up, the cops let the killer walk. Well it seems John worked as ""the real ghost stuff"" and has a friend (Christopher Meloni) who runs a barber shop and black ops operation in Columbus, Ohio...I guess due to the high demand. Once you can get past this and the Botox face, the film becomes a decent vigilante movie.

The film is simple. The twists are so overt and so clue heavy, it is hard to even tag them as a twist. The production includes some token religious scene so we can get the title. The banter between partners provides humor. There is plenty of killing by gun fire, hand to hand, knives, and explosions.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.  Solid vigilante entertainment.",1460764800,57,1070,4.650793650793651

7606155,5,B01AKEGU1S,"I don't understand the bad reviews. This was a cool entertaining old fashion action packed movie that could have been made in the 80's. Good acting, good script. Really loved the characters both bad and good. Loved the fact that the guys made a point of showing some pain after the adrenaline dropped like the old guys they were without making a big deal out of it. Travolta and Meloni make an interesting duo and I wish there had been more of that in the film. The banter at the end was perfect way to end the film. Must see this film don't go by the bad reviews.",1533254400,,564,4.231481481481482

7606205,2,B01AKEGU1S,"I don't typically write reviews unless it's to recommend things, but I felt compelled to ward off the hapless browser who may stumble across this 'movie' and think, 'WHY NOT?'. Here's why not, forget for a second the bad rug Travolta wore thorughout, that I kept trying to give the benefit of the to thinking they'd shave his head for the role and that's why they didn't put too much effort into it. WRONG. Bad rug, bad dye job, sorry I was fixated on it when there was such worse reasons to loathe this crapfest. The plot, while overdone, didn't turn me away, the inability to give the viewer any deductive reasoning WHATSOEVER did. They practically spell it out for you and do it repeatedly just in case you missed it the first five times. I don't mind it when they put a seemingly unrelated scene at the start of the movie that's supposed to give you an AH HA moment later, this movie beats it into you PLUS Travolta's acting is so stiff and flat out terrible I only finished it out of pity. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because Christopher Meloni (sp?) is mildly entertaining, though not great in this role and Travolta's daughter was in one of my favorite movies as a teenager, so for nostalgic purposes. I'm so glad I didn't waste any money on this movie.",1513728000,,1284,4.399159663865547

7606226,2,B01AKEGU1S,I really enjoy good movies in this genre of revenge thriller (or whatever you want to call it).  This one is relatively disappointing.  Acting was aight. Choreography and shots were nothing special.  Script was generic.  Makes you wonder how a project can get this far with so much lack.  It's sad to think of all of the talented people in the world who get ignored so that well-connected individuals can produce inconsequential media like this.,1506816000,2,445,4.88

I am a resident of Columbus. I saw them filming scenes in bexley and near Wolfe park. I knew this movie was going straight to DVD but Travolts is the kind of star cbus deserves.

I love this guy and he perks up even the most stale scripts. John Travolta's wife and child are killed and the cops on the case aren't really trying to hard to find the killer. So John, an ex-black ops guy (aren't they all) goes up the chain to find out what happened and who is to blame. Lots of guns and explosions and killings. it is pretty good so if you have some time go ahead and give it a look. Predictable but good and as I said Christopher makes the movie even more watchable.",1489795200,11,642,4.185483870967742

Is it entertaining, enjoyable, well acted and keeps your interest?  Yes
I love Chris Meloni in general, but especially in this role. It leaves it open for a second one, but I doubt it will get made, which is a shame.

Someone else mentioned John's hair in this movie, which made me laugh cuz it's the same thing I thought when I watched it lol

7606280,3,B01AKEGU1S,"I love John Travolta's movies, HOWEVER, this one was not his best.  His acting was not up to his normal standards.  Very stilted.  What was most difficult was the terrible hair they glued onto his forehead.  It hardly moved and looked like such a bad toupee that it distracted from watching the movie.  His 60+ years face didn't go with his 40+ glued down hair.  If he had simply played a man of his actual age, with the normal thinning hair, this would have been much better.  The story was fun for this type of movie.",1487030400,,519,4.34375

7606333,1,B01AKEGU1S,"2 great actors (John Travolta and Chris Meloni) + 1 bad script + 1 bad director + 1 bad cinematographer = 1 bad movie. Anything that moves the plot happens by accident. Writing was lazy or incompetent. For a former special ops character, the hero (Travolta), makes a lot of mistakes. That's how most things happen. He is a great special ops hero, who's main tactic is to don a hoodie (a disguise) walk into places, and almost lose  fights. And, the character cannot even successfully kill himself. The hero commits police suicide at the end, but he forgot to take off his body armor, so he survives. Was this supposed to be a plot twist? The writer & director should have watched The Equalizer with Denzel Washington, to see how to do this correctly. The story is disorganized. The tone of film is confused, ranging from action drama, to action comedy. The writer was either a 14 year old, or someone with absolutely no real life experience, or did no research. They should be awarded no points, and may god have mercy on their soul.",1482364800,,1033,4.553763440860215

7606513,1,B01AKEGU1S,"Travolta has been in decline for the past decade. This ""independent"" film leaves so much to be desired it is a shear waste of time to list any in any specific detail. After reading many of the other reviews I wonder if in fact those who enjoyed this D listed film really watched it in the first place. Thankfully, I waited for it to stream on cable for free; I would have beat myself silly if I had actually had to pay for this poorly directed, filmed, and acted performance. Rather than giving my two cents any further my recommendation is simply this: wait until its free before deciding to watch it, its a win, win otherwise be ready to slap oneself upside the noggin for not taking the free advice...",1474848000,,704,4.3816793893129775

7606529,4,B01AKEGU1S,"Yvan Gauthier and Paul Sloan are responsible for his tight script directed by Chuck Russell and for a change of pace in the current run of corruption in the police force and in politicians in general this film stands out as a cut above the usual tales.

Stanley (John Travolta) works with cars (his history includes Black Ops years ago) and is happily married to Vivian (Rebecca De Mornay) when Vivian is killed by a group of thugs. Though Stanley identifies the killer (Luis Da Silva. Jr.)  from a lineup the police (Sam Trammell) refuse to arrest him because Stanley was not a reliable witness! This starts Stanleys revenge ideas and his is aided by a fellow Black Ops colleague from the past (Christopher Meloni  never better!) and together they take down the thugs that are tied to the governor (Patrick St. Esprit) in all manner of crime ventures.

The theme is a distasteful if familiar one but the buddy aspect of Travolta and Meloni overcomes any flaws the film may have. Excellent photography and violence sequences. A strong film for this genre. Grady Harp, September 16",1474502400,,1080,4.759358288770054

7606604,2,B01AKEGU1S,"Something went badly wrong in the making of this movie.  Lots of somethings went wrong.  The 18 different producers scratched up a worthy $18 million to make this thing.  But then they lost their director and then they lost Nicholas Cage in the staring role.  Chuck Russell ended up directing the movie.  He has done some good if not spectacular work.  He has directed Scorpion King, The Mask and the 1988 version of The Blob.  He can make an entertaining film.  The screen play had actor Paul Sloan as the scribe.  The direction is bad enough that we really don't notice the script.  It has a reasonable flow with things following in a reasonable way.  But the directing takes any tension out of the story.
  And Chuck Russell lets his quite professional actors just meander through the tale.  John Travolta plays the lead, an ex-special forces operative who now works in the auto industry.  His wife (Rebecca De Mornay-still beautiful) is some kind of researcher on environmental issues who gets murdered at the beginning of the story.  Travolta and his old buddy (played by Christopher Meloni as if he was on Quaaludes) find the bad guys and kill them.  There are lots of bad guys, including writer Paul Sloan as a crime lord (he works as an actor much more often than as a  writer) and Patrick St Esprit as a dirty Ohio governor.  This one follows the path of other, better action flicks in that the main character simply finds, tortures and kill each bad guy to get to the next bad guy.  It isn't very believable or original.  Travolta uses the same trick to disarm three different bad guys.
  This one is so bad that it went directly to video.  It may be years before the herd of producers see any of their money back.

killed, he rely's on the local police to bring the culprits to justice, however, after he positively identify's the
prime suspect only to find that the police release him without charge, it becomes a game changer.
Trying to make sense of his wife's death has been impossible for 'Stanley' ...however his thoughts after the
Police's failure to charge the man he'd seen kill his wife leaves him little choice but to seek revenge.
He'll seek out old-friend and former comrade 'Dennis' (Christopher Meloni)  for advice though hoping that
his friend will watch his back when tracking down the killers.
The body count mounts however Stanley' and 'Dennis' discover there to be something far more sinister about
'Vivian's' death which will lead them beyond the killers to both political and police corruption.
There is plenty of kick-ass action in the film....described as Travolta's 'Taken' (there have been many films down
the years with a similar theme in truth)
Funnily enough the role of 'Stanley' was first offered to 'Nicolas Cage' for whatever reason he of course didn't
take-up the role.
The film never went out on general-release but went straight to video.

The script comes across like it was written by a group of high school students attempting and action movie.  For instance, the governor seemed to be in better shape than any of the experienced killers he dueled with.

The plot has been done and way better, Denzel W. did the same retired CIA black ops guy who comes back to correct an injustice and it was excellent.

I really like J. Travolta since his comeback in Pulp fiction - but trust me he's just not  believable and its challienging to watch - then in walks his  costar  from TV's Special Victums Unit - Christafer Maloni (balding bad temper dectective) he dose a great job but you can't help feeling like your move just down-graded to a Thursday night tv show. Rebecca D. Is excellent but exits the movie early, the governer Patrick St  Esprit so, so bad, the 2  corrupt detectives one worse than the other but both are terrible - there are good reviews of this movie, I think they've not seen the much better movies with the same plot to compare with or they love Travolta so much they see past the very poorly acted role and how unbelievable he is as an ex-black ops guy -

not to mention his costar (also ex black ops guy) actually saves Travolta over n over because travolts's character is so rusty he bungles his way through, so the star is not even good at what he use to do, yikes take a pass on this one.

I gave it a 5 star to help elevate the rating because it deserves a watch. There is a reason that the prevalent star rating is 3.5 and that is because this is a good old fashioned revenge movie that balances some light humor with some serious physical contact, guns and blood. John T is getting a bit old for this but that is the point of this movie so it works well. Christopher Meloni is a great supporting actor and I would like to see him in more movies. He is not your lead actor type but when he is cast in a supporting role with a good lead to partner with, he raises the level of the movie exponentially. Synopsis: ex black ops husband (John T) loses wife in a ""random"" gang hit and has to come out of retirement to figure out why. Good friend and partner from his wet work days (Chris M) partners up and has been keeping his finger on the pulse of things since retirement. These old professionals stack up the bodies and take a few hits themselves until they unravel the conspiracy. Rated R for violence with some scenes of scantily clad women... (no full nudity) and I do not recall any serious bad language. The plot is a bit thin in a few places but the action burns enough to keep you engaged. I like that the fight scenes were classic without shaky cam so you see some good fight choreography. Worth a rental but a good pick if it hits Amazon Prime.

Sure this is formulaic to the vengeance of someone murdering someone you care about by someone who underestimated you as a victim genre, but it was entertaining enough.  Didn't know the main guy from Law and Order SVU (well back when it started) was in this, but he actually plays the bad ass type well, in fact he was better than Travolta.  Sure someone with Travolta's skill set and knowledge should have worked out straight away when he had a slashed tyre in a deserted car park and a guy appears asking for a few bucks that he and his wife were about to get robbed and handled that.  He also should have noticed that it was a targeted attack since how else would they have known which car was his wife's to slash just that car's tyres.  But we wouldn't have had much of a film if he'd just killed or disabled all the attackers at the start of the film.

While on his way home she is murdered. After doing everything by the book legally the killer is set free. Not willing to accept that Stanley takes matters into his own hands and the hunt begins. First of all, this is not a bad movie at all. On the other hand its a little too generic for it to be all that good. There are a few neat twists in this but for the most part you can predict everything that is going to happen pretty easy. Travolta isn't a bad choice for this but he seems a little flat in some parts. In terms of the little B action movies that have been coming out this is definitely one of the best ones, but again this movie has been done over and over and is just not all that exciting.

Usually it's easy to turn this type of debacle into an evening of poking fun at the actors, the poor editing and the slip ups in continuity. In this case it just becomes to hard to stop looking at Travolta's pasty white face and comical hair helmet and 20 minutes into the movie you'll be wishing you spent your money on a bottle of Cabernet instead of this half witted, has-been o-rama.

Idiotic plot.....holes all over and some of the worse acting all year.

Oh...and by the way Travolta: buy a new hairpiece FFS.

7606828,1,B01AKEGU1S,"This movie fails on just about every level. Amazon should be paying people to watch this rather than charging for it. I will leave it to other reviewers to discuss the slap dash incoherently trite plot, the confused direction, and the incredibly bad acting by everyone involved including Travolta. This film should be a big, big winner at the next Razzies!",1462060800,6,356,4.852459016393443

Tamie, your hair looked great!! It's a Typical revenge style movie that a middle schooler could have written, my kid is available for the next film, hint.

8747614,1,B01AKEGU1S,"The script was terrible. A lot of unintended cheesy moments and lines throughout. Many characters felt inauthentic. Every fight scene and cool guy bad ass moment had blatant inaccuracies, and when combined with terrible editing, made it appear as if the actors, fight choreographers, researchers, and editors didn't care how the fight scenes (or movie in general) were going to turn out. Don't waste your time. There are way better movies available right now to satisfy the action movie craving you have. If you want to watch an action/thriller movie where the main actor is a high level scumbag scientologist in real life, watch one of the mission impossible movies.",1534723200,,667,5.072727272727272

8747616,4,B01AKEGU1S,"So far as revenge genre of films go, I Am Wrath delivers plenty of vengeance and action. There is virtually not a dull moment in the film, except for perhaps a handful of moments of respite between father and daughter are stretched a tad too long. They slow down the film unnecessarily. What is different about this film is that it clearly aims the vengeance at all kinds of targets in a plot that is simply structured and somewhat predictable, but is definitely not monotonous. A corrupt fictional governor of Ohio, corrupt cops, and members of a criminal gang receive well-deserved justice for being involved in the murder of a woman who happens to be the beloved wife of a former special ops commando. They certainly picked the wrong woman to murder, and for reasons involving construction of a pipeline that poses environmental risks. In real life we would of course prefer dilemmas such as those presented in this film's plot not be settled with so much extrajudicial violence. We would also prefer for justice to be more efficient and fair than it actually is. In the absence of quick and easy solutions to corruption and injustice, we can find a little relief by watching I Am Wrath and similar films such as Death Wish.",1534464000,,1227,4.711627906976744
8747617,5,B01AKEGU1S,"I am marking this 5 stars just to boost a ratings a bit. Granted the plot is not original, the dialogue can be thin, the church scenes are a bit annoying. But Travolta put some work into his character, who in lesser hands would be a tiresome cliche. The fight scenes were good; many moments of suspense even though anyone could guess how this would all turn out. E-Z watching, bring popcorn.",1534204800,,391,4.444444444444445
