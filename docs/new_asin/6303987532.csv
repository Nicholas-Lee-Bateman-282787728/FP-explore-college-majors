7859290,4,6303987532,"The Phantom of the West is a 10-chapter All-Talking Mascot serial released in January of 1931, starring Tom Tyler and Dorothy Gulliver, directed by D. Ross Ledermann.

Jim Lester (Tom Tyler) discovers an intruder, an escaped convict, starving and dehydrated, saying he is innocent of the crime that sent him to prison 15 years earlier.  When the sheriff arrives, Lester doesn't reveal the convict's presence, but is told that he is Francisco Cortez (Frank Lanning), who was serving a life sentence for the murder of Jim's father.  Lester finds that Cortez has departed, leaving a note explaining that seven men in Rawdon know who committed the crime.  Lester follows Cortez, and on the way encounters a ""mysterious band of horsemen"" known as the Night Riders, who use ""The Phantom"" as a password.  After the masked horsemen leave, Lester is attacked by two men, capturing one of them, Keno (Joe Bonomo).  He also finds a threatening note from ""The Phantom.""  In town, the seven men identified by Cortez have received similar threatening notes, all delivered by dart.  Keno is questioned, but is mysteriously shot before he can talk.  ""Mary Smith"" -- actually Cortez' daughter Mona (Dorothy Gulliver) is found outside the window, but says she has also received a threat from ""The Phantom.""  Soon the murders of the seven men begin, accompanied by visits from the mysterious Night Riders.

This is an early Talkie, with the expected ""silent movie"" acting and discomfort in delivering spoken lines by some cast members, including Tom Tyler, who had made a number of silent films.  Other familiar faces include William Desmond, Tom Santschi, Philo McCullough and Kermit Maynard among the seven men targeted by ""The Phantom.""  The ""comic"" character, a stuttering village idiot named Oscar (Tom Dugan) is quite annoying, though the style may have been dictated in part by what could be understood through sound equipment in theatres of the time.  Other ""unusual"" features are harder to excuse, such as Joe Bonomo's character showing up in later chapters, though there is conflicting information as to whether or not Keno was actually killed.  Either way, it is odd that nobody arrests him when he shows up in town, doing his ""trademark"" body-throw across the saloon.  This scene is used in a couple chapters; there is also quite a bit of footage recycled as ""flashbacks,"" even more than usual for a Mascot serial.  But Tom Tyler is fine in his action scenes, Dorothy Gulliver gets involved in ways other than requiring rescue, and if the plot doesn't always make sense there might be some form of explanation in the spoken introduction to the next chapter.

Alpha's edition, # ALP 4726D is on a single DVD running about 166 minutes.  All chapters of the source print are from a reissue, titles headed by ""Paul N. Robins Presents"" and identified as ""A Television International Serial.""  The head-switch-point glitch a few lines above the blanking bar betrays this as being from a videotape.  The image has some dirt and scratches but is fairly clean, reasonably sharp, with few splices and most of it with good gray scale.  The sound has a little noise and there is distortion in a few chapters, most obvious in the title music.  Unfortunately when the Television International reissue was done -- and it wasn't recently -- they made ""improvements"" including the titles and music.  A scene was cut at Lester's first encounter with the ""mysterious band of horsemen"" who were harmonizing a ""western"" tune, and sadly the syncopated chorus with which they terrorize the countryside as they ride got replaced with a ""dramatic"" orchestral theme.  It was a lot funnier to watch the citizens of Rawdon react with horror to the Romberg-esque operetta music, also originally used without the singing for the main titles.  Lee Zahler's name still appears on the redone credits, though little of his music remains.  While sounding rather silly, the original is a remarkable use of music in an early sound serial, and they adjusted the volume to match the distance of the riders.  A couple chapters are rather short, under 13 minutes, with most around 17.  Chapter eight, where picture and sound quality are at their least good, is missing about two minutes of ""retrospective"" material seen in another video release also from the Television International edition for that chapter.  Of greater consequence, there is a scene in the ""recap"" introduction to chapter six, showing Jim Lester dancing with Ruby Blair (Hallie Sullivan), daughter of William Desmond's character, which is nowhere to be found in chapter five.  Maybe the dance music was every bit as bad as that for the mysterious horsemen.

There is a 2-disc edition available from Sinister Cinema, on DVD-R, with somewhat better image quality, mostly not as badly ""sharpened"" as Alpha's, and less distortion in the sound.  It is also from the Television International reissue, but the chapters don't start abruptly, and include all of the opening music, beginning about 8 seconds before the main title appears.

While a restoration of the original version would be preferable, the one from Alpha is good for the price and fairly complete.  Those looking for good acting and impressive visual effects won't find them in this serial, though the outdoor photography is generally fine.  The plot has enough twists to overcome some of the roughness of early sound film technique, though as always with serials it is best watched one chapter at a time.",1306281600,3,5484,5.014348785871965
7859291,5,6303987532,"This serial surprised with how good it actually was, I was expecting something akin to pure sludge. What I got was an exciting serial with an appealing hero in Tom Tyler (Who has never let me down yet) as Jim Lester. In some ways this serial is laughable in it's antiquity, particularly the staging of the fights which makes it appear as if the combatants are fighting as children.

The Phantom's identity is easy to decipher and kind of ruins the proceedings a bit, but as stated before Tom Tyler alone covers all flaws this eager little mystern (Western+mystery) has. Most of which are understandable and easy to forgive when one considers that they had just barely left the Silent Era behind, however the acting is obviously done primarily in the silent technique. So if major overacting gets on your nerves this won't please you.",1206662400,7,833,4.744827586206896
7859292,5,6303987532,"...confusing, jarring, mind-numbing...existing in a dream-like state.
PHANTOM OF THE WEST, filmed in 1930 & released in 1931 is perhaps the classic example of the motion picture serial in transition from silents to sound...it's images & characters like Phantoms themselves projected onto some giant movie screen in your mind...weird.
It's as though someone with a home-movie camera went out and filmed these events, capturing a realistic look at the American West. But realistic this is not...It's more of a fantasy dream world.
For example, when hero Jim Lester (Tom Tyler) is ambushed by a couple of thugs in Chapter 1, he fights it out with thug #1 (Joe Bonomo) and brings Bonomo in to the sheriff for questioning. When Bonomo is forced to reveal the secret identity of THE PHANTOM he is shot from ambush. Now, in the very next chapter Bonomo reappears in the bar fighting with a drunk & appears in all of the following chapters even though he has already been killed off...and he doesn't even bother to change his shirt or add a moustache...as if in a dream.
Also, when THE PHANTOM is finally revealed we all know his identity cannot possibly be true because the character in question was seen in the company of others (earlier) when THE PHANTOM struck.
Now, I'm not criticizing this creaky serial, I love this film!
This was the first of the Mascot PHANTOM/MYSTERY/VILLAINS and/or SECRET/CLOAKED/NIGHT-RIDERS to come...THE VANISHING LEGION(1931), THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR(1931), FIGHTING WITH KIT CARSON(1933), MYSTERY MOUNTAIN(1934) & Gene Autry's THE PHANTOM EMPIRE(1935) folowed.
And it's really great to catch a glimpse of the 1930's American West before urban sprawl...Most of these Poverty Row Productions could not afford expensive sound stages to shoot on and so they had to make due with the real thing, actual location shooting!
I have both the VCI videotape and the ALPHA dvd and I compared them side-by-side and have come to the conclusion that both were taken from the same film source. All the scratches, wash-outs, jump-cuts, etc. are the same. However, this is really a great visual treat. Remember, this serial is from a cheap studio, but most images are sharp and surprisingly clear! I was amazed at the quality of this serial.
If you are just starting out on serials then go first with the Republic classics from the late 1930's-early 1940's: DICK TRACY(1937), DAREDEVILS OF THE RED CIRCLE(1939), MYSTERIOUS DR. SATAN(1940), JUNGLE GIRL(1941), SPY SMASHER(1942)...there are lots to choose from.
But if you want a classic example of the early roots of the sound serial, then this is your baby...& it's all just a dream...",1180742400,4,2641,5.059633027522936
