7818577,2,6301972600,"A very strange little movie from 1969, a tedious attempt at a comedy western that feels more like one of those crazy German sex comedies from the 1970s, only without the sex.  Notable for the first major screen appearance of the wonderful Caroline Munro, playing a Mexican senorita, but she isn't enough to save it.  This DVD gets a thumbs-down, too, for quality -- it's patently mastered from the original ""Gun Crazy"" VHS cassette,  which was terrible quality to begin with; grainy and muddy and with tracking dirt where the tape didn't play smoothly.  Not recommended except in cases of  desperate need.  Maybe someday this will be reissued by a legitimate  company.",1498435200,,668,4.910714285714286
7818578,4,6301972600,"Yes, it's a western and starts like one with a saloon scene and a gunfight. After that it's a comedy romp. It's funny! It is a western farce - silly and exagerated - well paced action - and many beautiful women. Caroline Monro has never looked better and might not be the most attractive.
  You will enjoy it. I did.

7818579,5,6301972600,This is the only Western Caroline Munro has appeared in and it was a nice switch from the Hammer classics and her great role in a Bond film.  She carried it off well and in fact years later it made her a popular guest at Western film conventions in North Carolina.,1264032000,4,264,4.176470588235294
7818580,5,6301972600,"We would love to see this movie transferred to DVD.  One of our all time favorites.  It is a hilarous western.  Sexual situations that younger children shouldn't understand.

It was originally titled ""A Talent For Loving"" but the USA made them change the title.",1254182400,2,261,4.863636363636363
7818581,1,6301972600,"Unfortunately I purchase the cheapest of the four videos available and was disappointed in the quality that I received. It appeared to have been copied, or merely was just so old (1969) that it should have been marked as POOR QUALITY. I would not have purchased it. It was misrepresented by the seller, daisy899.",1233878400,3,312,4.796296296296297
7818582,5,6301972600,"I think this is one of the funniest spoofs on westerns I've ever seen.  It's a laugh out loud movie but probably would not appeal to youngsters whose idea of westerns is Starwars. This ""senior"" folk likes it a lot.",1116288000,,214,4.35
