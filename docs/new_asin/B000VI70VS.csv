2942100,4,B000VI70VS,"""Foundations of Power Vinyasa Yoga"" is part of Yoga Journal's Great Instructors series, a series of DVDs filmed at the annual Yoga Journal Conference in San Francisco. It features Baron Baptiste, a well-known yoga instructor of power yoga. Here he presents an 85-minute class which emphasizes form and foundation in each posture.  Throughout the practice, Baron frequently mentions the spiritual benefits of each pose, and he focuses on the core through frequent reminders to engage uddiyana bandha.

Baron generally leads the class from the middle of the room, but he occasionaly walks around the room making adjustments along with his three assistants. The video also features a ""yoga demonstrator"" on a dais at the head of the class for easy reference. This DVD is well-chaptered, and the introduction suggests that each chapter can stand alone as a shorter practice if necessary. The chapters are as listed below; I have added in approximate times as well as brief descriptive information.

Warm Up (11m)--The practice begins in child's pose and then moves on to a slow, meticulous setup of down dog.  After coming to a standing forward bend and taking a few sun breaths, this segment ends with three chants of OM.
Surya Namaskar A (5m)--A slow sun salutation flow with longer holds of plank and down dog.
Surya Namaskar B (28m)--Here Baron begins to move fairly quickly through the vinyasa flows.  He provides detailed instruction for warrior 1 and also includes crazy dog (moving into a backbend), side plank, crescent lunge, and prayer twist.
Standing Poses (24m)--Postures here include several standing forward bend variations, standing splits, airplane, knee to side, eagle, tree, warrior 2, and reverse warrior.  Very fast vinyasa flows are performed between some of the postures.
Backbends (7.5m)--This gentle backbending sequence includes bow pose, locust, and half camel.
Seated Poses (12m)--Baron begins with boat pose and then moves into seated pigeon, 3-legged table, seated twist, full seated forward bend, and table or reverse plank.
Final Relaxation (9m)--Baron concludes the practice with reclined twist, viparita karini (not using a wall), and reclinded cobbler's pose; the practice ends in a seated position with namaste.

The Main Menu on the DVD lists a Play All option, an Introduction, Chapters, and Special Features. The latter includes an 8-minute interview with Baron in which he talks about his experiences with yoga since childhood.  He also discusses the evolution of his teaching over 25 years of practice and emphasizes the importance of a strong foundational practice.  Given this, Foundations of Power Vinyasa Yoga is designed to teach the fundamentals of the postures, and Baron suggests that it would be approrpriate for beginners to more advanced students.  Although Baron does keep the postures basic and offers many modifications, I would limit this practice to beginning yoga students who are already quite fit and strong, as even the simple postures presented here can be quite physically demanding.  I found Baron to be more affable and engaging here than in his other videos, where he sometimes comes across as a bit scripted.  He frequently jokes with the class and is quite light-hearted.  Overall, this is a solid vinyasa practice which is likey to appear to more beginning and more advanced students alike.",1198108800,107,3355,5.260299625468165
2942101,5,B000VI70VS,"I bought this dvd as part of the 3 great instructors package.  This is the first dvd that I've done from the set and I have to say that it was just what I needed.  Firstly, I'm a kundalini yoga person.  I gave up my vinyasa practice 5 years ago to practice ky.  Anyone who has fallen in love with kundalini yoga, will know that it sort of takes over your entire life and other types of yoga are unfulfilling.  However, in the last months or so I have felt the need to go back to hatha yoga and include it more into my daily practice.  This Baptiste dvd is a great place to start.  It is a simple, slow, power yoga class with a detailed focus on alignment.  Baron as usual, talks alot about the physical and spiritual benefits of yoga. This is a great class for beginners or experienced yogis who want to slow down their practice.  The poses are:
* Sun salutes A & B
* Flipping out of downward dog to 3 legged upward bow or full bow, if possible
* Side plank
* reverse warrior
* cresent twist
* forward bend twist
* standing twisted arms and legs
* tree
* modified standing hand to toe pose. (knee bent)
* bow
* half camel (loved this one!)
* hip opener, leg crossed on standing bent knee.
* one legged table top.
* half boat
* modified shoulder stand.  block underneath hips.

I may have missed a pose or two, but this a class that anyone can do.  I am hatha yoga rusty and I had a nice sweat going.  The last pose shoulderstand was like a meditation as Krishna Das was playing in the background.  The class ended with Baron telling the class to love the world, it needs it.  I felt myself smile.  Baron is a great teacher and even though the class was basic it was totally enjoyable.

Technically, the production was very good.  Kudos to Yoga Journal!",1195171200,63,1752,4.17910447761194
2942102,2,B000VI70VS,I was wanting basic instruction but this guy draaaaaaaags it out forever.  I am probably just too impatient; I could never get farther than the first 10 minutes.,1382313600,,161,4.75
2942103,1,B000VI70VS,"I have Baron's book and it's great. I had high hopes for this video, but it's like an instructional video for beginners and not really yoga practice. It's boring and very difficult to listen to. I was really disappointed and honestly only made it half way through the video...",1380931200,2,276,4.653061224489796
2942104,4,B000VI70VS,"This class is very 100% typical Baron Baptiste.  It is clearly his style, approach, delivery and sequencing.  It may not have the same appeal for everybody, but he consistently gives a class that ""works for me"".",1368144000,,211,4.833333333333333
2942105,5,B000VI70VS,I liked it enough to follow the program Baro has laid out for 40 day's! The dvd is easy to follow and intense to make me sweat but not overdo it.,1362960000,,145,3.7096774193548385
2942106,5,B000VI70VS,I am very new to yoga. I love the guided yoga DVD by Baron Baptiste. It has a meditative quality that I have only been able to access (up until now) in yoga classes. I look forward to becoming more aware of my body and mind!,1322438400,,224,3.891304347826087
2942107,5,B000VI70VS,"If you can only get one yoga class - this is the one to get. I was unfamiliar with Baptiste until I played the class. Now I am a follower. This guy has an amazing ability to make you feel like you are there with him, your class is personal, and he makes it a spiritual experience like any sweat lodge you've never been to. The exercise is hard work and what your body craves to break through the donuts! I have been in this video class 4 times now, and have yet to make it through to the end but look forward to the trip. Everything counts!",1311897600,2,540,4.0092592592592595
2942108,5,B000VI70VS,Baron Baptiste's Yoga Journal DVD is a gem.  You truly get his best teachings in a manner that won't overwhelm you if you're relatively new to yoga.  Be in the present moment with this yoga class.  You'll benefit greatly from Baron's teachings and feel so good!,1311379200,,261,4.630434782608695
2942109,5,B000VI70VS,"I am enjoying this DVD very much. It's like having Baron Baptiste in your living room as your yoga instructor. I feel great after my session, which helps with lower back issues, it strengthens and actually kicks my butt at times! I enjoy his approach to teaching. This DVD is about 1 1/2 hours long, but you can pick a chapter that you would like to work on for that day if you choose.  Quality and quantity for the money!",1306022400,4,422,4.275
2942110,4,B000VI70VS,"I am just beginning yoga and bought this because i was told to check out Baptiste's dvds.  i really like this because it is live and you really feel like you are part of a class.  its a great workout with many modifications for the beginner.  He also explains every movement and pose with detail so its easy to follow.  it is a 90 min workout and right now i can do about 50 mins because i am exhausted by the halfway point.  that being said, i think its great for beginners or advanced yogis because the full 90 min can be a great workout with his teaching.",1298332800,4,558,4.12962962962963
2942111,5,B000VI70VS,"It covers basic moves. But, it is so great! It teaches you the subtle moves that make the poses more powerful. I was amazed how just the slightest adjustment in foot placement changed the posture. This is a must have DVD if you are a life long student of yoga.",1294185600,3,260,4.22
2942112,5,B000VI70VS,"If you have never taken a class with Baron Baptiste, this will give you a taste of how wonderful he is. If you are lucky enough to have taken a class with him, this will remind you of what a great teacher he is. The sound of his voice accompanies me in my yoga practice.....Inhale! Exhale!",1287446400,,289,4.178571428571429
2942113,1,B000VI70VS,"I have heard great things about Baron's classes so I was pumped to try this DVD. I made it 10 minutes. The initial poses weren't bad, but he wouldn't stop talking. It was like he loved to hear his own voice and felt like he had to keep a running dialogue of babble. I have nothing against suggestions for improving postures or even encouragement but Baron goes past this and into an annoying territory. I will not be doing this DVD again.",1276732800,6,438,4.353658536585366
2942114,5,B000VI70VS,"This DVD was recommended to me by a friend who has been doing yoga longer than I have, and has even attended a conference or two.  I have taken classes locally and always enjoy the atmosphere of a class versus being home alone and doing yoga.  Baptiste's DVD really puts me in the class because he guides me through every position, making sure my feet, hands and fingers are where they should be, how they should feel, and reminds me to breathe as I bring my spine home... He continually talks to his audience throughout the session, and one cannot help but feel very present and in his class right there!  I really needed a DVD like this one if I wanted to do yoga at home because I am the type of ""yogie"" who needs to be guided otherwise I tend to ""daydream"" about this and that - not fulfilling the meditative purpose of yoga.  He keeps me on track..  Plus at the end of the DVD Baptiste talks about how he uses yoga in his life, and what it means to him.  He is fascinating; everything he says makes so much sense - well, to me anyway.  This DVD is like an hour and a half of not only a full body massage, but a mind clearing, posture enhancing, spiritual journey that gets better every time I use it, and it hasn't lost its appeal yet!  I don't believe it ever will. Namaste...",1269302400,15,1282,4.204081632653061
2942115,5,B000VI70VS,"I'm normally not a fan of power yoga, preferring bendier and more intricate flows with shorter holds; and much of my nearly 3 years' regular yoga practice--mostly at home--is minus all this technology (DVD player, streaming video, etc.), but this DVD really kicked my butt, and I am more-or-less at an intermediate level. I had never used a Baron Baptiste product before, and it felt like I was right there at the conference and that Baron was reading the energy levels from my practice in front of my TV. This is a formidable, soulful and inspiring practice.",1266883200,5,559,4.77319587628866
2942116,2,B000VI70VS,The yoga series presented was fine but this isn't the type of dvd I'd use over and over.  Baron spends a lot of time talking and his mannerisms will get annoying after the second or third time through.  I found myself sweating after the second sun salutation series but just couldn't get past how much he talks throughout the dvd.,1258156800,7,330,4.483333333333333
2942117,2,B000VI70VS,"Understand when purchasing this DVD that the emphasis is on the ""Foundations"" not the ""Power Vinyasa"". This DVD is big on explaining the positions more so than moving through them. So if you are new to yoga and need instruction on postures, then this is for you - the explanations are great. However, if you are a regular power yoga practitioner, the explanations will get in the way of a good vinyasa style workout for you.",1254960000,55,424,4.592105263157895
2942118,4,B000VI70VS,Very nice DVD. but not as tough as the real classes (likely because of emphasis on didactics),1244160000,2,93,4.529411764705882
2942119,5,B000VI70VS,"I really like practicing with this dvd. I haven't taken classes for years, have done hatha yoga off and on, and find this particular style of yoga and teaching really works for me. Its demanding, which is good for me (if its too easy, I'm not challenged enough to do it) and I like Baron's way of referring the student back to the inner experience, as well as good instructions on the physical alignment and breathing. I also use the Bootcamp cd set which has a 75 minute guided practice, and three 20 minute practices. The 75 minute class is very demanding, and the 20 minute ones seem way too short...but are good when I don't have a lot of time.",1238284800,4,648,4.363636363636363
2942120,3,B000VI70VS,"If you haven't tried one of Baron's DVD's then this is a must have. If you have never taken one of Baron's Foundations of Power Vinyasa workshops, then this is a must! If you are new to Yoga, this is a must.

If you have taken the workshop, then this is a refresher for you. This video really goes over the basics of a Sun Salutation, but is still a great reminder on how to perfect the pose.

I consider this DVD a great addition to my collection. Thank you Baron! Cant wait for some more.",1217203200,5,490,4.09375

8218801,5,B000VI70VS,"Baron Baptiste adds a very nice addition to my yoga routine. I'm usually a Rodney Yee only woman, but adding this video has 'stretched' (pardon the pun) my yoga routine in new ways. Very nice.",1437782400,,192,4.514285714285714

8218803,3,B000VI70VS,"It was a good solid yoga practice, but I found the instructor to be too talkative.  I understand the need to describe positions, but there is such a thing as too much detail.  Otherwise, this video is great for a beginner looking to increase their practice time.",1412553600,,262,4.553191489361702

8218805,5,B000VI70VS,"I really enjoy this DVD. I've been doing power yoga for over a year, but had to cut back due to soreness and muscle injury. The issues were my own, and caused because I never properly learned the form. This DVD is a great introduction to power yoga. It is about 1.5 hours, and while it goes slowly, I still feel like I got a great workout. The explanations are very clear, and I feel this is a safe workout. I will buy more!",1399075200,2,424,4.059523809523809
8218806,4,B000VI70VS,"Find myself doing Baptiste's 30 minute tape almost every day. Wonderful mix of yoga poses, stomach crunches, and meditation/relaxation. This one is harder and much longer (90 minutes). Good, but hard for me to do too often.",1390867200,2,223,5.054054054054054
