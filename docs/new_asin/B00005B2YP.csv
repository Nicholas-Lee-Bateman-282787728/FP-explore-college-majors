8540332,1,B00005B2YP,"I wish I had read the reviews. I too thought I was ordering  the Henry Thomas's  ""Beyond Obsession"".  I was just informed of shipment of the vhs tape so it's too late to cancel.  Fortunately I spent very little on this  so I'm not out of much money.  I am so disappointed and angry. I hope the seller reads these reviews and corrects the problem.  Do not order this movie! It's not what it is advertised. I will not order anything from this seller again.(Midwestern Books)",1407628800,,472,4.4186046511627906
