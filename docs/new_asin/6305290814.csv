7886894,2,6305290814,"Mark Paul Goesselaar fans won't be disappointed with Specimen.  Mike (played by Goesselaar,) starts fires with his mind and is probably a spawn from an alien species. He is tracked down by Eleven, a bounty-hunter/racial-cleanser/clean-up-janitor--who knows?--but Eleven really wants to destroy Mike. Most of this chase takes place in the largest community center in the free world. I love Mark Paul, he generally entertains me but this muck where he shows very little in the way of his ample acting chops is a sleeping pill. I believe this may be from the 80's which isn't all bad, (the clothes!) But this alleged community center...huge! I think high school. The performances were so wooden I could have used them for a table. There were opportunities to make this okay but someone didn't take them. the bad guy 11? What was that voice?????Terrible effects. Everyone made for bad actors.",1485993600,,888,5.040816326530612

7886896,1,6305290814,"Choose this movie because I like Sfy movies.
The movie was okay but not really all that exciting and was a bit boring.
I would only recommend it for people who like movies made in the 80's.",1393891200,,189,4.135135135135135
7886897,2,6305290814,I would say this was a mediocre made for TV movie. Not sure it was made for TV it could have been. If you're bored and this is the only thing on it might be worth watching,1353715200,,171,3.6486486486486487
7886898,5,6305290814,"i have met a lot of famous people in my time. my family are of english royal decent. but mark paul gosselaar is the best his acting skills are truly amazing and the ability to make the audience believe what ever he wants them to believe. i have every single film of his in my collection and there is not one i don't dislike.
in this film he plays his character amazingly well and what a great story mark is my favourite actor and i don't know if we shall ever meet again or if he will read this but he is the best at what he does in the world.

buy this film now you won't be dissapointed

7886899,3,6305290814,"SPECIMEN is a molding of two other movies:  ""Firestarter"" and ""The Terminator.""  They even have the two aliens appear in the buff, cute little buns and all.  Mark Paul Gosselaar plays Mike, a young man who has the ability to start fires; he is the spawn of an alien who impregnated his mother, and the aliens have sent a terminator type guy (played with muscular aloof by Douglas O'Keefe) to bring him back or destroy him (why, they never say).  In steps another alien, Andrew Jackson, who we find out has closer ties to Mike.
Mike teams up with a teacher and the local sheriff to understand what's going on; the sheriff (played dead pan by David Kerman) believes the story about Mike's birth, but Mike doesn't.  How else can he explain his powers, though?
Low budget and corny, SPECIMEN nevertheless works because there's a  modicum of sincerity to its thin storyline.  The special effects are chintzy, but the locale is beautiful.",1081987200,6,932,4.716049382716049
