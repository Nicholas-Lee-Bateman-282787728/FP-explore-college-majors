2122187,5,B0002V7T1U,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my girlfriend and I must say that it has not only been of great benefit to her but has helped me to understand the many facets of women in a new and meaningful way.  Contained in this DVD are subtle teachings that speak to the heart and help to align both women and men with the true nature of women that is far different than the one projected by modern commercialism and the media.

I have been a student of yoga for many years. I was extremely pleased to discover that this DVD offers teachings and meditations in an ancient system of feminine based Shakti/Tantric (transformational)yoga that has been handed down from teacher to student for thousands of years. I had heard about these powerful secret feminine teachings but this is the first time that I have encountered them.  They have been wonderful for our relationship and I highly recommend them to anyone who is seeking to gain insight into the many mysteries of women.",1164326400,3,965,4.566473988439307
2122188,5,B0002V7T1U,"I bought this dvd the other day, hoping that it would help me to relax, I've had alot going on lately & am open to anything that might relax me.  Wow!  This dvd is fantastic!  I started out just lying down, using earphones, so the sound would be all encompassing in my ears.  I meditated to Sharron's descriptive words of the goddess within us all.  Her voice is so calm, and even when I do fall asleep, actually that is the plan when I'm lying down to listen!  It works every time.  I drift off floating on beautiful feminine clouds of power.

The next time I listen to it, I sit in a chair & try to imitate her very feminine hand gestures as they teach me the power within.  I meditate while doing the hand gestures & there's no way that I will fall asleep during my sitting up session.  This is a double duty class for me.  A very pleasant surprise, depending on how I am feeling that day, either meditate & sleep, or meditate & mudra. I also have been playing over & over, the history of goddess as I am interested to learn more about this history.  I love learning about the inner feminine power.  This is a very beautiful dvd, very powerful feelings errupt from watching, or listening with eyes closed.  I didn't know I had all the feelings that have come from this guided meditation.  I love it!",1148083200,9,1302,4.278688524590164
2122189,5,B0002V7T1U,"This DVD is amazing. I'm going through personal transitions, and this is exactly what I needed. I like its blend of movement and meditation. I tend to fall asleep during most meditations, guided or otherwise. And I'm not exactly interested in bending myself into a pretzel like with usual yoga. This allowed me to visualize, feel, express, and get the energy flowing. I love the archetypes of the Goddesses and how this DVD helped me to commune with the Goddess inherent within all women. I highly recommend it to all women looking to embrace spirituality and wholeness.",1138233600,23,570,4.88659793814433
2122190,5,B0002V7T1U,"Each day presents us with the opportunity to live a better life, a life of light and compassion; but as the daily grind sets in, it is hard to remember the strength of our feminine hearts and the abundant gifts of the Goddess within.  Here, through Sharron Rose and Yoga of Light, we are given a doorway that returns us to ourselves, a Goddess gift that reminds us of our own potential and divinity.

  Working with these meditations and exercises has never failed to leave me centered, recharged and able to reenter the world with open hands.  Sharron Rose, in these beautifully expressed teachings, guides the user gently to a place of love, strength, compassion and clarity.  By working with the feminine spirit and the light body, the physical realm settles back into its rightful place -- as a part, but not the whole, of our amazing existence.

  Yoga of Light truly brings the Goddess light into one's heart and imparts the tools to keep it shining.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to expand their sense of peace and unity with the divine.  Thank you, Sharron, for sharing your knowledge with us all!",1111968000,16,1121,4.668367346938775
2122191,5,B0002V7T1U,"This DVD is very intense. I was attracted to it because I want to know who the goodess is. I want to make her more alive for me. I was raised Catholic and still struggle with finding the female god. I really need her to exist and be real. The male god in the heavens just doesn't work for me. I know there is a female primal life force which I need to connect with in order to survive. So I look for ways to help me know she exists. In Sharron's DVD, and her incredible book ""Path of the Priestess; Guidebook for Awakening the Divine Feminine"", I find that the goddess is not outside me in the heavens but inside me! And she is made manifest by doing the mudras, meditations and physical exercises on the DVD and in the book! Wow! I am so happy to feel her life and energy and form inside me! Now I am starting to get it....

When I first got this DVD, I did all the exercises straight through. Afterwards, my stomach was upset. I was even dizzy. I think it was too intense for me. So now I just do a few sections at a time. This DVD is set up so that I can easily choose specific sections. I really appreciate having these tools to help me make the goddess manifest in my own instrument, my own life. I kept wanting the goddess to be this powerful being outside me who could control the events in my life and fix things, etc. It is so much better to know she is so much more. The ""female"" energy is still so mysterious because of the void and darkness where her seeds grow. I love the female mysteries. It's exciting to be partaking in them more and knowing I am female.",1103500800,24,1571,4.084142394822006
2122192,5,B0002V7T1U,"As a woman who longs for the beauty of the sacred sisterhood where women are free to express the many facets of their being, I was thrilled to discover this powerful DVD. As a long time tantric practitioner and sacred dancer, I was moved by the depth and subtlety of  the teachings transmitted by Ms, Rose. It is clear that she has traveled deep into the heart of the traditions that respect and revere the Goddess. Her knowledge and ability to transmit the subtleties of the Tantric and Alchemical teachings for women is clearly evident in her meditations and visualizations. They touched me on so many levels.

After performing the mudras along with Ms. Rose, while opening myself to the beauty of her words, my awareness of and ability to see and sense the flow of energy through my chakras and subtle energy field was deeply enhanced. These are serious and powerful feminine teachings passed down through a female lineage. They align women with and enable them to feel the natural flow of the divine Shakti energy. With each section I was able to sense the potent energies of the Goddess rising up within me. In Igniting the Inner Fire, I felt her invigorating and arousing energy awaken. In Awakening the Serpent Power, her sensuous and enchanting energy. In Opening the Heart, her compassionate and soothing energy.

I highly recommend this DVD to both women and men who want to know more about the mysteries of woman and the Goddess.",1102723200,20,1440,4.752
2122193,5,B0002V7T1U,"For many years I have been searching for yogic teachings that would speak to me from the perspective of the feminine. I have looked into Hatha yoga, alternative healing and other systems designed to help one relax and open the heart to heal emotional wounds and psychological imprints. Each assisted me in its own way to become a more realized, focused and compassionate person. However, my desire for greater insight into my feminine nature still called out to me.

Watching, listening to and performing the meditations and visualizations taught by Ms. Rose, struck a responsive chord deep in my heart. Here were the long awaited teachings from a woman who spent her life searching for the remnants of  a female-based yoga. After viewing Yoga of Light, I understood the mechanics of the energy field and the chakras in a new way -from the feminine perspective. Each exercise gave me new information on what it means to be a woman. After repeated viewings and listening to the guided meditations while performing daily tasks, I found that my ability to deal with stressful situations had improved. The exercises that Ms. Rose presents offered me a new way to express my emotions. Modeling myself after the strong and fiery goddess, as she suggests, I have begun to develop a greater level of clarity, self-awareness and detachment. For when I am in these difficult situations, rather than get caught up in old patterns of expression I remember these teachings and do my best to put them into practice. In addition, meditations such as the sections on Opening the Heart and Healing the Luminous Body help me to calm my mind as I let myself ""relax and feel the warm, nurturing and revitalizing energy of the Goddess flow through me.""",1102550400,12,1731,4.864406779661017
8032466,2,B0002V7T1U,Not a yoga video of any kind.  Very cheaply made.,1453507200,,49,3.9
8032467,1,B0002V7T1U,"I truly hate to be a critic, but, you know, I am a little bit annoyed that I bought this. This is not at all what I expected. This is meditation based (which is fine) but I ordered this because I thought it would be ""Yoga"" as the title says.

As somebody who has been meditating for years, I agree that this is a way to become grounded and find your inner spirit, especially if you're a beginner. But if you're looking for body Yoga (Poses) this is not the video for you.

I was very excited for this DVD to arrive, but I highly doubt that I'll buy anything from the company that makes these series. It seems very cliche' New Agey.. but hardly helpful if you're looking for a more authentic spiritual experience. What was I expecting though, it was a $20 DVD...",1428364800,,761,4.241379310344827

8032469,3,B0002V7T1U,"Ok, I am open to everything and I wanted to really get into this, but I agree with another reviewer who said this would be better as an audio recording because the instructors movements and facial expressions are very distracting. It's not so much an instructional tool as it is a demonstration.",1395273600,,295,4.6923076923076925

8032471,4,B0002V7T1U,"I really enjoyed this dvd- I just thought it would have been better as a cd. I'm not sure why they call it yoga of light because there isn't an actual portion of the dvd where there is any instruction on how to do the yoga or the mudras. However, Sharron's voice is very soothing, and the dvd itself is extremely relaxing and emotional. I almost cried on more than one occassion. It was a little repetitive and there is a lot of running light through the chakras and your body whole, not that that's bad, cause it's not. This dvd is very empowering for a woman and it is also quite comforting. I can definitly see myself coming home from a bad day and putting this on to soothe my soul. At the end of the dvd you might feel exhausted (I did) and if that's the case, I think it's best to watch it one section at a time. This dvd really puts you in touch with the divine feminine. A definite keeper. Two thumbs up.",1277856000,3,912,4.129213483146067
8032472,2,B0002V7T1U,"Doesn't work well as a DVD, would work better as a close your eyes CD. I'm just not quite sure what to think about this one! I'm a feminist but not so much into my ""womb"" as this woman is. It's an interesting DVD, I guess, and maybe beneficial to some, but I won't be watching it again soon. There are so many other tapes out there, I'd really chose another.  To describe the DVD, it's a woman sitting in a chair, for the entire DVD, wildly vibrating her hands in circular motions (Mudras) following guided meditations. You really can't follow/learn the hand motions and meditate at the same time either, it's really a bit odd, cheaply done, and not really beneficial for any cetain purpose.",1233446400,6,691,4.484126984126984
8032473,4,B0002V7T1U,"This is an hour and 12 min dvd by Sharron Rose including a 7 min introduction is very beautiful. It's set on a simple spot for Sharron to sit on a low artistic chair? with many rich dark reds through orange fabrics draped on the walls & beautiful Tibetan, Indian, etc. religious statues & art beside her on the floor with plants & pillows.
The chapters include: intro, cleansing the luminous body, igniting the inner  fire, awakening the serpent power, opening the heart, healing the luminous body. There are also trailers of other dvds such as artmind, secrets of alchemy, healing the luminous body - the way of the shaman, sound yoga, nada yoga, etc.
Sharron has a wonderful, soft, soothing, but strong voice. She is very expressive throughout. The music is played softly & is very soothing & matches with her pace & voice.
This dvd is about visualization, meditation, empowering yourself & simple hand movements you can do standing or sitting like Sharron. The hands follow her story telling. Moving your hands like water, making look like a lotus flower, winding them up in front of the body how the energy moves like a serpent up the spine, etc. There is no other movement necessary.
From having a bad day & my energy being off, I enjoyed hearing her voice, but didn't feel the hand movements did anything for me the first 3 min. I even thought them silly & unneeded. I did other things while still listening since I didn't want to actually stop the dvd.
After a while I felt like sitting & really enjoying her beautiful chosen words & voice & relaxing in a chair. Within minutes, more relaxed & more centered, I wanted to give the hand movements another try. I enjoyed them more & felt them feel more intuitive. After 1 movement, my intuition instantly hinted at moving them a certain way & seconds later, that's how Sharron moved them.
I was able to enjoy this for only a brief minute before I was interrupted. After that conversation, my energy again was frazzled & since it was late, I gave up trying to relax with her for the night.
This dvd is great to relax to when you are ready & have time to. Don't do it when there's a good chance of being interrupted or you are short on time the first time you try this.

Sharron has her own site under her name SharronRose to get more information, though no pictures or video of this dvd, but you can see a photo of her.",1183420800,4,2372,4.475750577367205
