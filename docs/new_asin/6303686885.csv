719784,5,6303686885,"Seems I agree with critic anne on just about anything where this actor is concerned!  But in addition to his prowess as a fast gun, watch for the fleeting camera moments that distinguish his acting from others...after he  is trapped into shooting his best friend, watch the body language as he  bends over the friend, but particularly when he raises his head to look at  Bronson and note the shock, pain and grief in his eyes.  Also, compare the  facial expressions when he is talking to the rancher's wife and when he is  talking to his new-found girlfriend.  In the former scenes, it appears that  he is trying not to be rude, but can't stand her; and in the latter, there  is a tenderness that is also seldom seen on the screen. Don't miss this  film!

Been wanting to see this movie ever since someone recommended it some time ago.  Finally went on sale around the holidays and I snatched it up.

What an outstanding film this is.  I haven't seen Marty yet, but JUBAL stands as my favorite Borgnine film.  Great story with another villainous performance by Rod Steiger.

719996,4,6303686885,"If you would like a change from John Ford's Monument Valley backdrops, here's a western with the Grand Tetons and what looks like the Snake River, very handsomely shot.  It's not a bad movie but there is a flaw, I think.  The plot requires the protagonist, the itinerant cowboy Jubal Troop (Glenn Ford) to be the object of desire of  two very different women -- Mae (Valerie French), the wife of his boss, the cattle-rancher Shep Horgan (Ernest Borgnine), and Naomi (Felicia Farr), the daughter of a group of religious pilgrims seeking the Promised Land somewhere around Pocatello, Idaho.  Jubal likes his boss, who has in effect taken him in and made him his foreman on the ranch, and while he  clearly sees Mae's attractions, he resists them and is more drawn to the innocent and sweet Naomi.  Mae isn't pleased, and neither is Pinky (Rod Steiger), Mae's former lover and a ranch-hand who had expected to be made foreman himself.  The problem is that neither woman is remotely convincing, and the fault is probably more in the writing than in the abilities of the actresses.  They are made into stereotypes, and neither is capable of breaking out to create a convincing, humanly interesting character.  That's a serious flaw, but the main interest of the movie lies elsewhere.

Jubal's ascension to foreman sets up the parallel with Shakespeare's ""Othello,"" which clearly underlies the movie to some extent.  Pinky becomes the Iago figure who convinces the good-natured but insensitive Shep that his wife is sleeping with Jubal.  Like Othello, Shep becomes enraged and is out for blood.  To make matters worse, Mae, unlike Desdemona, lies to her husband about Jubal because she's angry at Jubal for rejecting her.  I'll say no more -- it all sets up for an exciting finish.  There are strong performances from Ford, Borgnine, and Steiger, although Steiger's accent -- he's supposedly Southern -- isn't like any accent I've ever heard, and it sounds mannered.  But the performance isn't, and he's entirely credible as a disappointed and jealous man.  Ford is fine as the quiet and sensitive Jubal, who will only use violence when there's no alternative, but the most interesting performance, I think, comes from Borgnine -- he's generous, amiable, and trusting, but, at the same time totally insensitive and thus has unwittingly alienated the affections of his wife, whom he treats as a prized possession.  He calls her a ""heifer"" at one point.  When he's deceived by Pinky and his wife, he has to become murderously angry -- and he very credibly does.

The smaller roles are well-taken -- the youngish Charles Bronson has a nice turn as a wanderer who becomes an ally of Jubal, and the actors who play the members of the pilgrim group are fine too.  It's fun to watch -- too bad the women didn't get a better deal from the screenwriters and that they weren't perhaps more strongly cast.",1437868800,2,2888,4.853061224489796

720201,5,6303686885,"Until today, it was my misfortune to have never seen a really good print of this amazing movie.  In previous viewings, I always enjoyed it, though I was so young on that first encounter that I failed to appreciate how special it is.  I read that its director, Delmer Daves was a great devotee of the scenery and the lore of the American West.  In this new gem-like edition from the brilliant Criterion restorers, that fact is achingly obvious.  See this version, particularly on a really big screen, and you'll recognize that it is one of the most beautiful examples of its genre ever photographed.  To further delight any fan of fine film-making, it is loaded with many other riches beside its exquisite visual splendor.  The cast, packed with many of Hollywood's finest veteran character-players, is well chosen and in fine form.  A frighteningly menacing Rod Steiger steals the show as the monstrous villain of the piece, but every actor in it handles his, or her role excellently.  The hard-edged tale gains particular strength from the fact that the intricate plotting always arises so smoothly from realistically motivated interaction between the characters.  Too many films, particularly from the era when it was made, insult one's intelligence by deriving their dramatic, and their action highlights from clumsy plot manipulations designed to move the story to its set-piece climaxes.  This movie intriguingly moves from one riveting twist to the next with a feeling of psychological truth that gives it a solid feel of believability that is wonderfully gratifying.  Those looking for a stock-standard Western, full of conventional heroics and hyped sentimentality, may find this rather dark tale a bit too harsh, but Criterion's dazzling new edition, together with the movie itself, make it a proud new addition to my collection.",1403308800,,1838,5.134228187919463
720202,5,6303686885,"Great western.  Magnificent scenery (where was this filmed?) and beautiful photography.  A young cowhand (played by Glenn Ford) ends up at the spread of a kindly rancher who is a good man (played by Ernest Borgnine).  The young cowboy becomes the focus of the rancher's wife (played by Valerie French).  Ford's character is not responsive because of his gratitude and respect for the rancher.  He instead develops an innocent romance with a young woman who is part of a wagon train of highly religious pilgrims.  Meanwhile another cowhand (Rod Steiger) who once had a fling with the rancher's wife jealously starts stirring the waters further by spying and filling the rancher's ears with poison.  For me the best character is the rancher's wife.  As played by French you feel sympathy for this woman who through her own fault is stuck in a loveless (for her) marriage and is trying to find real love.  Sadly her husband truly loves her, though he is a lout albeit lovable.  Highly recommended.",1399852800,,994,4.863095238095238
720203,3,6303686885,"""Jubal"" is a western that's loosely based on the Shakespearean play ""Othello."" It stars Glenn Ford as Jubal, a ranch hand who runs afoul of another ranch hand, played wonderfully by Rod Steiger. Jubal's involved in a love triangle with his boss's wife, and his boss, which sets the stage for a thrilling story.

The problem I have with Jubal is that the final third of the film gets way too melodramatic, especially when Glenn Ford is given another love interest. The movie starts to weaken because of this unnecessary character.

Despite this criticism, this is still a pretty good movie. I love the Director's work, especially 3:10 to Yuma. Also, the actors are all fantastic in the film.",1399593600,,690,4.7899159663865545

Borgnine is a rancher with 10,000 acres and troubles with hired hands, mountain lions, and a wayward wife played by Valerie French.
Steiger's evil may have  been restrained in The Illustrated Man and Dr. Zhivago but it's in full bloom here. His character enjoys evil more than the characters he played in the other two roles combined. Borgnine admits to Ford that ""I'm ugly..."" Meanwhile Ford fights off the wayward wife's advances.
 Charles Bronson has a minor role amidst all the drama.  Ironically, he would go on to superstar status while Borgnine, Ford, and Steiger were relegated to careers as solid actors who could carry a lead role but who never achieved Bonson's fame.",1393632000,,840,4.853146853146853

Now will Criterion please complete the ideal set by presenting the original and very distinctive COWBOY?",1376006400,,427,5.584615384615384
720284,2,6303686885,"First, I was excited for this.  Despite the fact that I'm not really a devoted fan of the Western, Delmer Daves directed `3:10 to Yuma' to following year (1957), and I found that to be a masterpiece of genre so I had high expectations for this.  Couple that with the fact that I had recently seen and loved `Marty' and consider Rod Steiger to have been one of the greatest actors of all time, I was pretty excited to see both Steiger and Borgnine work their magic in a Western.

For me, `Jubal' is a film that works heavily in parts, and falls apart rather horribly in others.  It is a film that is `half right', as in the first half is a tragic bore and the last half is rather intense and kind of brilliant.  I'm torn here, because I want to say that this is great based on the last impression, which sticks with you, but I cannot ignore the fact that the film's first half nearly put me to sleep and had me wanting to bypass the whole thing.  Honestly, if it weren't for Steiger's magnificent performance I probably would have.

The story behind `Jubal' is ripe with promise.  Jubal Troop is a man constantly running from something (although we never really uncover what it is that he is on the run from).  On the outset of the film, Jubal is found lying beside the road, beat up and out of sorts, by Shep Horgan, the beloved rancher.  Jubal instantly catches the eye of three important people.  The first is obviously Shep, a happy-go-lucky man filled with spirit and a good eye for those he can trust.  He trusts Jubal and the two become close friends.  The second person that takes a particular interest in Jubal is Mae, Shep's wife.  Mae is unhappy in her marriage, unfulfilled is more like it, and looks for escape in the arms of other men.  She is taken with Jubal.  He is handsome and promises her some danger and the feeling of being alive that she has lost in her marriage to Shep and lonely life on the ranch.  The third person, and most important, to cast his eye on Jubal is Pinky, Shep's most prominent `right hand man'.  Pinky is a sly and jealous person who has his heart set on Mae and his mind set on destroying Jubal's reputation with Shep.  As Pinky observes Mae's attraction and advances towards Jubal, Pinky begins to device a plot that should get him everything he wants.

Structurally, this doesn't work as well as it should.  The first half, where Jubal is establishing himself in Shep's life and that of the ranch itself, is rather straightforward and boring.  In fact, the first thirty minutes or so drag on and feel like an hour.  The subplot involving the religious group traveling in stagecoaches and parking on Shep's land is a tad forced, and while they do serve as an important plot device in the end (more like props really) they don't offer much to the themes of the story (despite attempting to) and so I find them really unnecessary and distracting.  The love interest aspect of the story wasn't needed either, and it took away from the real crust of the film, which revolved around Pinky's jealousy and his diminishing qualities.

That is why the second half works more than the first, because it sets in motion Pinky's scheme and really allows Rod Steiger to pounce all over his role.  He unleashes the demons so-to-speak and becomes this unspeakable depiction of evil.  The way he uses his eyes and his distinct vocal annunciations to evoke pure manipulation is chilling.  You can see his mind working through the rest of his `moves' and finding a way to get what he wants.  When he finally sees his goal in his sights there is no containing him, and when he loses control and unleashes his rage it is not only shocking but completely progressive (his attacks on Mae are particularly unsettling for such early cinema).

I only wish that Ernest Borgnine was as effective as Steiger.  Borgnine is just a giant oaf here, and is so obnoxious it is hard to understand why he was so beloved.  He was supposed to be a friend to all and one that everyone loved (outside of Mae, who was distraught) but he was like that annoying guy that never leaves the group despite never being a real part of it.  Glenn Ford and Valerie French are both in fine form, but Ford is once again overlooked thanks to a castmate (this time Steiger) who manages to do more with the material.

The finale has more of a predictable or clich&eacute;d vibe than I wanted it to have, but leading up to it was nicely worked.  Despite being uneven, I can recommend this for a few things, not the least of which is Steiger's performance.  The base story itself and the way that it is handled is very strong.  Sadly, the two halves don't make a whole and the poor cinematography doesn't help matters (it is a very `ugly' film).  The score is bouncy and full of life, and the dusty town is properly depicted, but this is really a film to see because of Steiger's devilish turn and little else.",1375660800,,4895,4.4584269662921345
720285,4,6303686885,"This terrific western was directed and co-written by Delmer Daves, one of the better filmmakers that Hollywood produced.  In this ode to Shakespeare's ""Othello"" Jubal Troop (Glenn Ford) is found by Shep Horgan (Ernest Borgnine) in the high mountains nearly frozen.  Shep, a successful Wyoming rancher brings `Jub' back to his ranch house where he and his winsome French-Canadian wife Mae (Valerie French) nurse him back to health.

Shep offers Jubal a job as a ranch hand where he works with the humorous Sam (Noah Beery Jr.), dim-witted Carson (John Dierkes) and thuggish Pinky (Rod Steiger).  While Shep loves Mae, he treats her like a pet dog at times, patting her on the rump, stealing a kiss which she objects to.  Mae, who married because she thought Shep was extremely wealthy and had access to the finer things, finds herself isolated with a man she doesn't love.  She sees the hunky Jubal as not only a release of her pent up passions but perhaps a way out.  Jubal successfully fends off Mae's romantic intentions, primarily because of his fondness for Shep.  He's temped.  After all, he's just a man and Mae is gorgeous.

Pinky, who once had his own fling with Mae sees Jubal as nothing but trouble for him, not only for Mae's flirtations but sees himself and next in command.  Shep has other ideas and promotes Jubal instead.  The confrontations between Jubal and Pinky come to a head when Jubal overrides Pinky's decision to force a small wagon train off their property even as they were treating illness in their group.  The religiously focused group (obviously Mormons) were looking for the Promised Land.  Among their members is a young Naomi (Felicia Farr), the daughter of the leader.  She takes a hankering to Jubal and him to her.  He even give Naomi her first kiss.

Pinky's jealousy, now fuming suggests to Shep that Jubal is playing hanky-panky with Mae.  He's not of course but walks in on Mae sleeping alone but murmuring Jubal's name.  That's enough proof for Shep so out he goes looking to kill Jubal.  Jubal defending himself after several shots from Shep's rifle misses and kills Shep.  Everyone is now after Jubal resulting in a tension filled final act.

This is a beautiful film to watch, filmed with the Teton's as a backdrop.  The adult western almost has a noir feel to it with numerous individual standoffs, usually between Jubal and Pinky.  Speaking of Pinky, my one complaint is the miscasting of Steiger.  His over-the-top bellowing suggest his method acting doesn't work in a more subtle story like this.  And while Ford and others appear to be well acquainted with the West and horses, Steiger just looks ridiculous.  Glenn Ford and Delmer Daves would team up for 2 more westerns (""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Cowboy"" which featured Jack Lemmon, Felicia Farr's husband).  If you are a fan of westerns, don't miss this fine film.

The Blu ray transfer from Criterion look very good with the wide-screen 2.55:1 aspect ratio with a 1080p resolution.  The color was excellent as was the picture in general.  I did see some light fluctuations in some of the darker scenes.  Here is the info provided by Criterion:

However there were a handfull of directors like John Ford, Anthony Mann, Bud Boetticher and Delmer Daves that elevated the genre to an art form. Jubal is no exception. Daves combines Shakeperian and Noirish elements to make a complex psychological Western. Using a uniformly fine cast Glen Ford shines as the hero who overcomes his past to make a new start. Ford was a fine actor who seldom overacts. The one exception was Gilda and the object of his desire was Rita Hayworth. Who could really blame him for going loco?

720355,5,6303686885,"Forget the awful looking jacket and the non-descript film title.  Jubal is a great Western.  What do you want from a Western?  Westerns are time machines, and you want to ""feel"" like you're in another place and time.  Jubal does that, with great scenery of the Tetons and some other Wyoming locales (the Absoroka Range?) and a plausible looking frontier ranch.  It is clearly not shot in the foothills above Los Angeles.  The realism extends to the characters, who are engaging but not caricature, and who have jobs instead of just hanging around a saloon.  The plot is not formulaic, and contains several different angles of conflict.  It rings true to the human condition: jealousy, petty intrigue, honor, and friendship.  There is someone to root for (a common lapse in more modern Westerns), an ""everyman"" with a sense of honor.  The only oddity is a wagon train that doesn't seem to have a clear destination, but that is offset by a rare spectacle: a respectful depiction of religious people.  As per the era in which it was made (1950s), the language is clean, the sexual tension doesn't rely on nudity.  The antagonist (Glenn Ford) is conflicted, hence interesting.  The acting is good (with Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, and Rod Steiger as supports for Glenn Ford).  It is, all around, a very good western.  Why Glenn Ford isn't remembered as a prominent Western star beats me, as he turned out more Westerns than Jimmy Stewart, who is no slouch in the Western arena.  There is no part of the film that is ""dated"" (such as the hokey music in High Noon or the silly trench coats in Tombstone).

There are so many westerns that, just by the law of averages, most of them are mediocre, but ""Jubal"" is an unexpected standout. The plot - a reworking of ""Othello""  - is a disquisition on the themes of jealousy, loyalty, honor, betrayal, and friendship. Those themes have been done ad infinitum in other movies but I think two things stand put in ""Jubal."" First is the very high quality of the script. The dialogue is spare, straightforward and free of the hackneyed prose so endemic to most westerns. Second is the outstanding level of the acting, which is perhaps not unexpected with the likes of the great (and greatly underrated) Glenn Ford, Rod Steiger, Ernest Borgnine and Charles Bronson.

The execution is what one would expect from the scores of the period but the music could have been written for a film today. This is in a special class of film scores composed by one of the masters in the 1950's. It is in a rarified class with the likes of Elmer Bernstein, Bernard Herrmann , Jerome Moross, Alex North and Franz Waxman's output of the period. Watch the film but enjoy the music.

Directed by Delmer Daves

Likable (and extremely gullible) ranch owner Shep Horgan (Ernest Borgnine) hires handsome drifter Jubal Troop (Glenn Ford) as a cowhand, much to the delight of Horgan's hedonistic wife Mae (Valerie French). But psychotic ranch hand Pinky Pinkum (Rod Steiger) is envious of Jubal and hoping to enjoy Mae's sexual favors himself - ergo, he sows the seeds of suspicion in Horgan's mind by falsely accusing Jubal of messing around with Mae. Within the maelstrom  of emotions that develop, the virtuous Naomi Hoktor (Felicia Farr) comes to the aid of Jubal

Although often considered to be (Shakespeare's) `Othello Out West', Jubal is officially based on a novel by Paul I. Wellman.

Solid dramatic western - a blueprint for many 50s westerns

720410,4,6303686885,"JUBAL is a nicely entertaining Western soaper. Directed by Delmer Davies who gave us several earthy,  romantic, baby-boomer soapers [i.e. A SUMMER PLACE, 1959;  PARRISH, 1961; ROME ADVENTURE, 1962] and who gave us the original, classic 3:10 TO YUMA [1957]. This deals with an itinerant cowpoke, played by Glenn Ford [Jubal], who is hired by wealthy rancher Ernest Borgnine. Big boss Ernie is a gruff, rough-around-the-edges and round-around-the-middle man of the land who has a much younger wife, the latter played so memorably well by an actress named Valerie French. The boss takes a liking to his new man---admires Jubal's skill, work ethic and advice---and quickly promotes him to #1 hand. A couple of minor problems: the boss' wife also takes a liking to Jube, and a long-time ranch hand, played annoyingly well by the great Rod Steiger, is more than a little perturbed at the quick promotion. French is terrific as the petulant, fervent young spouse who is willing to give up everything for the stalwart Jubal. Steiger is scene-stealing as the envious hand who has always desired the boss' wife. He tries to undermine Jubal at every turn---stirring up the other hands and the boss. Borgnine is grand as the loquacious but ignorant and gullible ranch owner. Young wife can't seem to pin Jubal down as the latter remains rigidly loyal to the man who gave him a job and hope. Jubal subsequently encounters a migrating group of religious settlers and falls for the group leader's innocent and isolated daughter played exquisitely well by Felicia Farr. Farr's crush on Ford is beautifully portrayed by Davies, no one better than the old pro at depicting the flavor of young love on the screen. Farr is beautiful, angelic and splendid in her small role. When the boss' wife finds out Jubal has a gal she presses the pedal to the floor in her attempt to get her man. Tries to seduce Jube afer he escorts her back home one night. Meanwhile Steiger adds fuel to the fire by suggesting to the boss that the two are having a fling. Borg confronts his wife only to be ridiculed and spuriously told that she has been intimate with Jube.  He now confronts Jubal intent on killing him. The latter is able to fatally shoot his boss in self defense, barely. Steiger, who in the meantime has beaten the wife after she repels his advances, now publically accuses Jubal of the premeditated murder of his boss and of the fatal beating of his young wife. A posse is now after the innocent hand. Gets a little syrupy at the end but overall great performances with Steiger and French standouts. And what can I say about Glenn Ford: one of the most underrated actors ever and one of the best. Fact that French never really made it after this reaffirms just how tough Hollywood really is. Nice seeing familiar Western vet Noah Beery Jr [RED RIVER,1948] and Paul Kersey, I mean Charles Bronson [pre-DIRTY DOZEN, pre-DEATH WISH], with small roles in this one. Really nice cinematography. Very nice job by Davies adding a few suds to the beans & bacon in this one.",1256947200,4,3041,4.744801512287334

It had been broadcast on TV many times through the years, but there had never been much to really pull me in for a full viewing. Now that I have given the film its due, I conclude that my original instincts were correct. It attempts to be a great film, but just does not hit the bullseye. Its problem is in the script. It tries hard to serve as a work cut out of the mold of a Shakespearean tragedy, and to an extent, it succeeds. Without giving away the plot, I must say that it sort of reaches the tragic juncture a tad too early in the narrative. This creates a problem in how to end the story. Performances are pretty good. I was particulary impressed by Ernest Borgnine. His character is like animated electrical voltage in the film. Glenn Ford, as always, is good, but not as effective as he is in other westerns. This is due to the script. Rod Steiger plays a perfidious jerk to perfection. However, I don't think a guy like that would have lasted long in the old west! One surprise is an early, and effective performance by Charles Bronson. One almost wishes director Delmer Daves had given him more to do in this movie. The DVD quality looks ok. I am glad to own this film, but in all honesty, I am not sure how often I will revisit it.

Shep, a friendly good-natured husband and the best loved man in the territory, offers his help and trust to Jubal and names him his foreman... Shep was proud of the ""sheep-herding friend"" who got lost in the blizzard, and came over the pass from Montana, running from ""bad luck.""

Mae (Valerie French), a rancher's wanton wife, spins the plot by her attentions to the disinterested cowboy Jubal, which further stirs up the surly range rider (Rod Steiger) with whom she had previously been carrying on an affair, unknown to her genteel husband...

Truthful and straightforward, Jubal is caught between a loyal friend and an insistent desirous unfaithful wife who considers her husband's fine ranch a ""10,000 acres of lonesomeness.""

Mae was not in love with her unattractive husband... She thought she just picked the right guy to patch it up with... She even considered an evil plan in her mind... Maybe another affair, a new love, a murder...

One night, she went crazy... She lied to Shep telling him that Jubal was here in their room, in their bed... She yelled angrily in pain: ""I'm sick to my stomach every time you kiss me. Let go of me. I hate you. I hate the way you look at me. I hate every single thing about you. I love him. Do you hear? I love Jube.""

In that moment, Mae inflames a torrid fuse of sex, jealousy and revenge which make of Delmer Daves' ""Jubal"" a rather engrossing piece of adult entertainment...

Glenn Ford was honest in his feelings toward his boss (""Shep made me feel like somebody. Shep gave me a reason for living."") ignoring that he was caught in a net of lies, murder, and uncontrolled passions...

Rod Steiger was exceptional as the sadistic top hand who strongly disliked Jubal's gizzard... Pinky spots Mae's sights on Jubal... His jealous was so great as his strong sexual desire for the ex-lover...

In her film debut, Felicia Far was the radiant and beautiful as the little Rawhider responding to expert handling...

""Jubal"" returned Charles Bronson to the West and to the company of director Delmer Daves, with whom he had made ""Drum Beat."" Cast as a ranch-hand friend of Ford's in the employ of Borgnine, Bronson contributes his natural masculine presence to this psychological Western...

Set against the mountainous fertile valley of the Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, and beautifully photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor, ""Jubal"" is a powerful adult Western in constant suspense...",1163030400,12,2629,4.925339366515837

720489,5,6303686885,"Released in 1956, ""Jubal"" is easily one of the best 50's Westerns and ranks with my all-time favorites.

THE STORY: An injured drifter, Glenn Ford as Jubal Troop, is rescued by ranch-owner Shep (Earnest Borgnine), who ultimately promotes him to foreman of his ranch. This stirs up the envy of ranch-hand Pinky (Rod Steiger) and the desire of Shep's young sexpot wife, Mae (Valerie French), which results in even more hostility from Pinky since he used to enjoy the adulterous attentions of Mae until Jubal came along. The captivating drama is as old as the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife from Genesis 39.

Add to this mix a group of trespassing Mennonites (or perhaps Quakers) who have in their company Naomi (Felicia Farr), a godly woman who attracts Jube's romantic eye, and Reb (Charles Bronson), another drifter who befriends Jube.

WHAT WORKS: For the first hour and ten minutes or so ""Jubal"" is captivating cinema of the highest order. Shep (Borgnine) is simpleminded and nave, but likable and full of mirth. Mae (French) is fully clothed at all times, yet somehow oozes sexuality with every simple glance or word, proving that sexiness involves way more than merely showing skin. Naomi (Farr) is an interesting addition to the story: her purity attracts Jube just as much as Mae's adulterous tactics turn him off.

Rod Steiger is perfect as the villainous Southerner-turned-Westerner ""Pinky."" Notice how his hostility toward Jubal is rooted in arrogance, envy and jealousy. Also notice that his strategy to destroy Jubal is deception -- getting others to believe lies. This is how it happens in real life with enemies who hate you for no actual reason. Since there's no grounds for their hatred they resort to lies to destroy your reputation and poison people's minds against you.

Glenn Ford is perfect as the tragedy-laden drifter and how can you go wrong with (a young) Charles Bronson?

A big bonus is that the film was shot on location with the mighty Grand Tetons as a backdrop the entire story. These magnificent Wyoming mountains are nothing short of breathtaking!

The last act is potent in that it reveals the destructive power of a lie, IF it's believed. The only people liars can deceive are simpletons with no discernment; the wise remain skeptical until they observe concrete proof. You'll notice that two of Shep's men refuse to take Pinky as his word because they discern his fleshly motivations, not to mention they likely caught him in lies before.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There's too much scampering around in the last act as the plot ties-up loose ends, but it's redeemed by the powerful subtext. Also, the opening credits score is understandably dated but, thankfully, the rest of the score isn't bad for the 50s; in other words, it doesn't prevent you from enjoying the movie.

BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""Jubal"" is a powerful psychological Western; there's thankfully no Disney-like unrealistic vibe anywhere to be found, nor lame attempts at humor (like ""The Desperadoes""). The film expertly touches on issues of friendship, envy, jealousy, competition, lust, hate, love, hope and the destructive power of a lie.

Let me add that Jubal is a man of fascinating noble character: he amazingly resists the skillful advances of the luscious Mae, like Joseph with Potiphar's wife, obviously because he wanted something better -- a woman he could trust!

""Jubal"" is a must for every Western fan's film library.

The film runs 100 minutes.

720490,4,6303686885,"Jubal is the kind of adult western that was rare even in the heyday of Western production in Hollywood. A great cast, strong writing, and beautiful scenery makes it that much more enjoyable.

Jubal is a luckless drifter, played by Ford who is rescued from exposure and starvation by wealthy rancher Ernest Borgnine. Borgnine soons put Jubal to work as a ranch hand. Borgnine has a very young and beautiful wife, played by Valerie French. She takes a strong liking to Jubal, which not only complicates his relationship with Borgnine, but further strains his dealings with a jealous fellow ranch hand Pinky, played by Rod Steiger. Things go downhill from there.

Add Felicia Farr playing her normal stalwart Western beauty and Charles Bronson as a friend of Jubal's, and you have the making of a great film. It's way past time that this was on DVD.",1109116800,60,846,4.787671232876712
720491,4,6303686885,"Glenn Ford, Ernest Borgnine, and Rod Steiger make the most of this excellent movie. Ford plays a drifter cowboy who is rescued and given work by wealthy rancher Borgnine, who is unaware that ranch hand Steiger is having an affair with Borgnine's much younger wife. Steiger becomes insanely jealous of Ford's relationship with Borgnine, and tragedy ensues. This a very well-written, well-acted Western.",1106265600,8,401,5.380952380952381
720492,5,6303686885,"In the mid-1950's writer-director Delmer Daves made a series of superior westerns for Columbia studios. Too bad these films have not gotten their critical due from movie historians or critics. Perhaps it's because they lack the thematic continuity of a Buddy Boetticher or a John Ford to tie them together. Still each entry presents its own distinct virtues and all are greatly entertaining. If the compact, and tautly told ""3:10 to Yuma"" is the best of the lot, the scenic and sprawling ""Jubal"" runs a close second. This mid-series film features  Glenn Ford's easy-going charm, a rowdy Earnest Borgnine, a luscious Valerie French, and the panoramic backdrop of Jackson Hole Wyoming. And in an odd piece of casting, which Daves seems fond of, method actor extrordinaire Rod Steiger appears as a treacherous ranch hand named of all things, Pinky!  Following the dueling styles of Ford vs. Steiger is at least as interesting as the otherwise well-staged outbursts of gunplay.
Judging from other entries, such as 1958's ""Cowboy"", Daves seems  genuinely intrigued by the real life of cowhands. Thus the cowhands in Jubal are more vividly drawn and distinctively presented than their usual role  as faceless stage props. The story itself features a fairly explicit (for its time)  woman in heat (French), whose  scheming shenanigans set off a plot-driving  chain of events, while shifting alliances among ranch hands and settlers round out a sprawling and sometimes over-generous plot. And, oh yes, making a sudden appearance half way through, a lonesome Charles Bronson in a tacked on role that perhaps provided a needed payday, (Daves and Bronson had been together in the earlier, oddball essay ""Drumbeat"".) If none of this sounds good, then just sit back and take in the beautifully photographed alpine landscape that has salvaged many a western much less worthy than ""Jubal"".",994982400,36,1874,5.1650165016501655
