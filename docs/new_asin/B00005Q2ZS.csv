7949699,5,B00005Q2ZS,"You have to take this movie for what it is, softcore - mostly lesbian - with great T&A. It's a spoof on the ""Sixth Sense"" but by no means follows any kind of plot. Eye-Candy, not a thriller.",1166313600,2,190,4.026315789473684
7949700,1,B00005Q2ZS,"It's hard to believe that the same folks who gave us The Erotic Witch Project turned out a spoof as bad as The Sexy Sixth Sense.  Francis is an exceedingly geeky fellow who suddenly begins seeing dead strippers appearing in his home.  Four of them pop up one at a time on his bed, a couple of them appear later in his kitchen, and then the other couple take a turn on the couch, but Francis can do nothing more than watch all of them roll around and do next to nothing.  His psychiatrist, who kindly offers to remove some of her clothes in order to gain his confidence, isn't really much help; she's also not really who she seems to be, but that's really not hard to figure out.  Content-wise, this is by far the tamest Seduction Cinema movie I have seen; all of the scenes are remarkably bland and, to be honest, not very revealing at all.  Darian Caine seems to put some effort into her role early on, but eventually she too just sort of gives up and joins the other actresses in simply going through the motions.  The plot is thin and rather absurd; for instance, a clown comes by to use Francis' bathroom for no discernible reason other than to add a little toilet humor to the movie.  Basically, nothing in this entire movie works or entertains.
Along with the actual movie, you get a short ""behind the scenes"" featurette and an interview with Barbara Joyce, but these extras really add nothing to the overall package.  Without a doubt, this is the most boring, least enjoyable Seduction Cinema film I have ever seen.",1045699200,,1522,4.4496402877697845
7949701,3,B00005Q2ZS,"compared to other seduction cinema releases, this movie is pretty tame and sadly short on laughs. the premise is good, but the filmmakers didn't do enough with it. if you took out the lesbian ghost scenes, you would have almost nothing. the recent EROTIC WITCH PROJECT 2: BOOK OF SEDUCTION is proof positive that you can make a low-budget film where sex is your selling point, yet still manage to come out with a highly entertaining product with a lively script. if for no other reason, get this movie for the brief interview segment with darian caine and esmerelda delarocca on the couch. it's hilarious.",1003104000,7,605,4.771428571428571
