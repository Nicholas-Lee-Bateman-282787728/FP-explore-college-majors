8503477,1,B006R6ZYCU,"I was under the impression, after reading all your write-ups, that Region 2 would play in San Diego Ca and it does not.
Make a DVD to play in America. I will be sending it back asap, being totally disappointed. Too bad because I saw one show
on PBS and it was terrific. This is the very  first time I have a negative input about my purchase.
 Otherwise I have always been very satisfied with Amazon.",1434585600,2,399,4.2368421052631575

8503480,5,B006R6ZYCU,This series is breathtaking and enjoyable!  Region 2 DVDs can be played on most laptops or computers..... although sometimes you can only change the region 4x.,1391385600,,159,5.115384615384615
8503481,2,B006R6ZYCU,"I never got to watch it due to the fact that any DVD made in Great Britain will not work on DVD readers made in the U.S..
Also the return price to G.B. would have cost more than the refund.
SO,I am a unhappy owner of DVD's that I wanted to see.",1372809600,,244,3.7115384615384617
8503482,2,B006R6ZYCU,Very Disappointing!! I made a big mistake when ordering this DVD! Did not realize that it would only play on UK DVD's. I cannot play this video and I did not get two DVD's - just one. I ended up shipping this to my friends in London who can watch it on their player. Will have to watch it with them on my next visit to U.K.,1360281600,,323,3.8358208955223883
8503483,4,B006R6ZYCU,"I should have been more carefull when I ordered, I didn't notice that this was a format that doesn't play in the US and it clearly says that.  Oh well, I'll give it to a friend who travels there.",1354838400,,195,4.0
8503484,5,B006R6ZYCU,Martin Clunes does not disappoint in this stunning DVD featuring little known islands around Britain and the ordinary ( and some not so ordinary) folk who inhabit them.  The scenery is magnificent and Clunes is a natural with his humor and genuine emotion.  Have wanted to own this since I saw it on PBS and thanks to the joys of owning a PAL DVD player I can revisit and enjoy it over and over again.  Maybe someday it will be available in Region 1 format......until then consider getting a PAL player as it opens all sorts of entertainment possibilities.,1353974400,7,556,4.595959595959596
