No one should be offended by the infidelity in this film. There is no gratuitous or unnecessary sex in this film. In fact they don't show anything more than kissing. The main characters, Luanne and Jake are engaged but he cheats. He does it to makes sure he isn't missing out or whaterever. The point is, he was wrong to do it. He realizes that he isn't missing out and that he has no doubt about wanting to marry her. He confesses and wants her to date another man to make it even so they can move on. It's twisted but I understand why he would do it. The problem is that it's a overly simplistic, shortsighted way to resolve it, so it goes further than he expects. The thing I loved about this film is that it forces her to examine her expectations and fantasies about love, marriage and morals realistically. There was no sugarcoating or ignoring real human emotions. In this movie they didn't make any technical distinctions based on where they were in their relationship. Like, ""she can get over it because they were on a break"" She had to deal with the reality  that he made a selfish decision that ruined their perfect record. She had to make a hard decision about what she wanted now. They didn't patronize women by having her go out on a string of wacky dates with crazy men and go running back gratefully to her cheating ex-fiancee. And they didn't have her change her morals dramatically. She learned some things without totally succumbing to cynicism and lowering her standards to fit in a unworthy man. Because it bugs me when women act like any man is better than none so they accept someone who they can't even discuss with their girlfriends without being ashamed. The story was refreshing and it didn't seem low budget. This looked 'real' and real was looking pretty nice. They had nice apartments and clothes. The actors were attractive and dressed suitably for their setting. They didn't seem unreal at all. I wish Billie James was in something else because I was impressed.",1129939200,,2008,4.575
7925488,4,B00004WIEP,"This could only happen in a movie.  Jake and Luhann are together and ready to marry, at least Luhann is.  Jake, during a bout with cold feet and wanting to be sure he is making the right decision, has an affair with another woman.  In order to be fair to his intended, Jake confesses to Luhann, who ends the relationship.  Jake then gives his fiancee a deal based on payback: go out on dates with other men and find one man to sleep with.  After it's out of her system, then come back to him and they can resume their relationship leading up to marriage.  As if his proposal wasn't bad enough, Jake actually becomes overconfident and states to his best friend Bridges that no matter how mad she was, she was still devoted to him and this will blow over with her forgiving him and they both move on to happily ever after.  What Jake doesn't realize is that his he is banking his own selfish dreams on the one thing that Luhann can't be sure of anymore-her heart.  Among the many enjoyable players in this twisted game is the lead actress, Billie James, who plays Luhann with all of the strengths and weaknesses of a woman willing to accept a proposal of this magnitude and working thru all of the drama that comes with the contract.  A light, entertaining piece of work.",1047686400,28,1269,4.388888888888889
