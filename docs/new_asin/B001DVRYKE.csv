3540303,3,B001DVRYKE,"If you're into corny sci-fi from the 60's and 70's get it! If you only watch blockbusters and chick flicks, stay away! I love old yul brynner sci-fi movies and max von sydow actually did a great acting job for being a B movie sci-fi flick, so the purchase was good for me. Battle beneath the earth was OK too. The beginning is kind of catchy, ""just like ants!"". Drink plenty coffea to make it through the middle of the movie. Enjoy! P.S. if you like Yul Brynner Sci-Fi movies, make sure to get ""Future World"" & ""West World""!",1239667200,15,524,4.303030303030303
3540304,4,B001DVRYKE,"A deal between Warner Home Video & Best Buy, one of a group of double titles.  BATTLE BENEATH THE EARTH, starring Kerwin Matthews and several refuges from early Bond films -- including the late Ed Bishop -- is non-remarkable tale of a renegade Chinese general burrowing through the earth to invade and topple America.
THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR from 1975 tells of a world 37 years in the future when society has collapsed and the survivors live in barracaded communities.  It is a brutal place (it actually takes place in 2012!) where cannibalism is rumored to be happening.  In the immediate story you have the Baron (Max Von Sydow) the leader of one such community trying to stave death.  Against them are the savage group led by Carrot (B-movie Legend William Smith).  Into this mix comes a killer for hire named Carson (Yul Brynner).  He throws his lot in with the Baron and ultimately is asked to take the Baron's pregnant daughter and the surviving crop seeds to an island Carson knows of off of North Carolina.
This is a relatively low budget effort written & directed by Rober Clouse (ENTER THE DRAGON).  Fairly entertaining, it is, however typical of the apocalyptic films of the time in how badly it imagined the human race slipping: A BOY AND HIS DOG, SOYLENT GREEN, DAMNATION ALLEY, et al.  Von Sydow turns in his usual measured performance.  Brynner is ok as Carson, albeit too old.  What can you say about Big Bill Smith?  The best crazed, over the edge psycho in movies.  A glimpse into how the future was forseen by the people of the 1970's.  Score is Gil Mille, best remembered for KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER tv series.",1223251200,18,1630,4.67719298245614

3540306,3,B001DVRYKE,"I hate rating 'combo' DVDs, so I'm going with a generic rating. I love Battle Beneath the Earth - though I'll acknowledge that it isn't really a good movie. Still, it's one of those things I remember from childhood, watching it at a local drive-in. The Ultimate Warrior - I'll confess I haven't watched yet.",1453766400,,307,4.6

3540313,5,B001DVRYKE,"This information courtesy of DVD Drive-in! web site . While I've only seen The Ultimate Warrior recently thanks to Warner Archive Instant streaming channel , I'm of the opinion that this is a five star get for me . That picture features the always excellent and enigmatic Yul Brynner and Max Von Sydow and a top 70's and 80's villain in the person of big William Smith (Rich Man , Poor Man's Falconetti circa 1976) .
Kerwin Mathews is a safe bet for me as a film collector as well as I own and appreciate Hammer's Maniac (1963) and The 7th Voyage Of Sinbad (1958) . In reading , it's my understanding that Mathews co-star in Battle Beneath The Earth (Peter Arne) is a fellow he has good chemistry with and previously acted with him in Hammer's Pirates Of Blood River (1962) .",1424563200,5,775,4.426573426573427

3540326,4,B001DVRYKE,"There are two sci-fi movies on this DVD (I bought it for The Ultimate Warrior).

Battle Beneath the Earth has got to be one of the most laughable movies aver made! Plot, acting, production, the lot is farcical which is the only basis on which I could watch it. It's a popcorn hoot!

The Ulitmate Warrior is a 70s favourite of mine. It details a sombre, frightening future story of post apolalyptic survival. Yul Bryner and Max Von Sydow share the acting spoils, the inevitable violence is at about my limit (I have a low violence threshold in movies) the morality issues are interesting and plausable and the climax is a real ""ouch"". This will never be a classic but it tells a worthwhile tale well.",1383091200,,699,4.5396825396825395

3540332,5,B001DVRYKE,"Bought this for the ""Ultimate Warrior"" alone, and I suggest it stay that way, as the other title is worthless even by grade ""z"" movie standards.  Saw the ""Ultimate Warrior"" as a junior high kid back in early 80's on late night TV, and it has been a cult favorite of mine ever since.  Yul Brynner tries to save what little hopes for civility and a sustained food supply are left after the apocolypse.  Brynner was a fantastic tough guy throughout his career and this is one of his better showings in his later years.",1304035200,2,515,4.4

3540334,4,B001DVRYKE,"An interesting film from the 1970's, part of a string of movies -- such as SOYLENT GREEN, THE OMEGA MAN, DAMNATION ALLEY, A BOY AND HIS DOG,etc. --which deal with civilization after some violent cataclysm. Yul Brynner was no spring chicken when he did this role but performs well. Max Von Sydow as the Baron (originally it was to been called THE BARONEY) delivers as a man struggling to keep the people in his charge from being overcome by the violent forces outside his compound and from extinction. In some ways a precurser to the MAD MAX films. Then there is Big Bill Smith. Has anyone ever played better-- and more -- crazed over the edge psychos than this son of a gun? I think not. In an interview he said that in his death scene, while rats ran over him, one actually crapped in his mouth. Now that's taking one for the team! This was written and directed by Robert Clouse ,who, in the same year , helmed Bruce Lee's ENTER THE DRAGON.

As for BATTLE BENEATH THE EARTH ...  a boring film with Kerwin Matthews (7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD, WEREWOLF IN WASHINGTON D.C.).  It seems longer than its actual running time.",1261612800,8,1114,4.477832512315271
