8180861,4,B000LT61G2,"An enjoyable mini-series with a happy ending. Nicely done although not in the same class as ""My Lovely Sam Soon"" The male lead grows from a rather dumb, naive yet nice person to a major Korean film star in the meantime winning the girl of his dreams. The first part of the series where the fake tv contest takes place is better than the second half.",1216166400,,349,4.303030303030303
8180862,5,B000LT61G2,"For those who have seen GoSoo in 'Green Rose', it's a very different portrayal for him to play the hero Kim Younghoon here, as a poor guy who does 12 part-time jobs to support his family.  He is unable to find a better job as he did not finish high school, partly because he is not very bright, partly because he had to quit school and work to pay off his father's debt.  (Interestingly his elder brother does not work, neither does his father.)  Anyway, his only solace and source of courage is the love letter he got from a classmate Han Eunyoung, (played by Kim Hyunju)when he was in 7th grade.  So the story unfolds as he met Han again after more than 10 years and he is still hopelessly in love with her.  Han regretted writing the love letter after she found out Kim did poorly academically, and had since dismissed the guy in her mind.
The TV show brought the two of them together, and Kim's good looks and sincere attitude won him great popularity with the audience and was on his way to stardom.  However, when Han was involved in a scandal, Kim gave up his blossoming career to save Han's reputation, and had to start from bottom up again.  This made Han realized how much Kim loved her and for the first time, she professed to Kim that she loved him, too.  After many challenges the couple finally got together and the story had a happy ending.
I am very impressed with the acting of the cast, especially the male lead GoSoo and female lead Kim Hyunju.  Kim Hyunju plays the vivacious Han Eunyoung and there is seldom a dull moment with her.  With GoSoo, it's an even more chanllenging character to portray and he has done a wonderful job.  One of the best moments is when he turned away from Han after giving her the diamond ring, thinking he'll never see her again.  That is so poignant!  Since he's been rejected repeatedly in the first half of the story, he seldom smiles.  But whenever he got any positive response from Han, he smiles and it's so heart warming!
The plot might be a little contrived for us to understand (especially when we Americans, who don't even bat an eyelid when the politicians get in ugly sex scandals)why a perfectly innocent video of two people walking out of a door could cause such an upheaval.  But the acting of GoSoo and Kim will make you forget about the problems in the plot.
I heartily recommend this to all!",1202860800,2,2358,4.413394919168591
