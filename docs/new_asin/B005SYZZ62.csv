4887480,3,B005SYZZ62,"First and foremost, it's not much about the discs that are in question but rather than it's official release. It's actually a made to order DVD set from Warner Archive website: a la The Pirates of Dark Water. So it's a basic direct transfer of the tapes...",1331510400,,256,4.468085106382978
4887481,5,B005SYZZ62,"This isn't a review of the show but more of a warning to anyone who wants to buy this item.  I read another review that said not to freak out over the backside of the DVD because it's purplish in color and not the standard clear color.  This person believes that it is a copy coding thing or something but in reality the reason that it is purplish is because it is a DVD-R.  Pretty much all DVD-R's have this same color on the backside of the DVD.  I'm not saying that the DVD's are poor in quality or anything but just know that they are not professionally produced DVD's.  Also, if u look at the descriptions very carefully there is a note about DVD-R's as well as letting u know that the region is all regions which also usually means DVD-R's.  Your professional DVD's usually are like region 1 for the US and then there's region 2 and 4, etc.  Just thought I would give u a heads up about this DVD set.  I will still probably purchase it because it will be nice to finally have all of the episodes of this fantastic show.  Thanks for reading.",1328659200,32,1046,4.21608040201005
4887482,5,B005SYZZ62,"I should first say how rapidly I received this, the long-delayed second half of the 80s animated series Silverhawks. It was an early Christmas gift, and I didn't expect this to come out until early January!
At any rate, I checked out some episodes and I can't complain about the quality -- well done.
Also, don't freak out when you look at the playing surface of the discs of Volume 2 (they have a purplish appearance as opposed to the shiny, full color spectrum appearance). It must be some copy-proof thing. But they will do just fine in all DVD players (including my Arcam DVD player).
I'm glad we now have all 65 episodes of this 80s classic!",1328659200,7,646,4.483050847457627
4887483,5,B005SYZZ62,"I am so very glad they made the volume 2 set. This was one of my favorite shows as a kid. It was very eighties cartooning but I don't care. I loved every minute. In fact as a kid it came on at 6 in the morning and I would get up to watch it. Once I tured on the stereo to hear the show in surround sound and it was a little too loud. Well, my old man woke up and can out to the living room in the ""buck"" and turned it off. Walked back to his bedroom without saying a word. I knew I was in a ton of crud but I didn't care. I love the Silverhawks.",1323129600,7,545,3.512396694214876

4887503,5,B005SYZZ62,This was truly one of the best series of it's time. This cartoon was just a joy to watch and I wish some one would do a remake of this or bring it to the big screen in a big budget action movie( and not some dumb spoof).,1369612800,,220,3.6041666666666665

4887505,1,B005SYZZ62,"Just finished checking our *third* copy of this and the second halves of discs 2, 3 and 4 are all bad, just like the first one. I'd swear were getting the same bad discs back except the first copy we got actually had 2 more working episodes than the other sets. Based on other good reviews, I have to assume the masters aren't totally broken, but this burn-on-demand process seems extremely flawed. You'd figure it wouldn't be that hard to do, wouldn't you?

I suppose we'll send this back again, and give it a few more shots before we give up (or Amazon decides to stop wasting money on shipping bad discs).",1363910400,7,608,4.428571428571429
4887506,5,B005SYZZ62,The story line is great!  I watched this program during the 80's as it's just as fresh as it was back then.,1363392000,3,107,3.8636363636363638
4887507,5,B005SYZZ62,Got this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law and he loved it. He had it on his Amazon list and it camed nicely packaged and brand new as stated.,1356566400,3,150,3.71875
4887508,5,B005SYZZ62,"Its great to take a trip back through memory lane. I loved watching the Silverhawks, Thundercats, and original He-Man back in the 80's. Finally, I can complete the series with vol 2. The quality is what you would expect from a show almost 30 years old, its not remastered or anything or even in Dolby 5.1 but who cares! Its roughly vhs quality and don't let the dvd rw thing scare you off. I noticed some reviewers had a hard time playing the discs. Ive had no issues at all, im using an old Oppo 980 dvd player. I don't understand why the price is so expensive for vol 2, especially compared to vol 1. To me, I want to complete the set so I paid it. Who knows how long Silverhawks will be available, its still cheaper than a new release video game and will probably be used more over time. Journey back to Limbo and complete your set of Silverhawks!",1347062400,4,850,4.253086419753086
4887509,1,B005SYZZ62,"This is the second time I have attempted to purchase ""burn-on-demand"" dvd9s from Amazon. And the second time that NOTHING will successfully play them. On a number of different players they either freeze or go blocky or just skip sections in the middle of a showing. I am sure that the content is wonderful, otherwise I would not pay the asking prices for the products, but I am just as sure that I will not make the same mistake a third time.

I hope you have better success with these then I did.",1341878400,12,497,4.344086021505376
