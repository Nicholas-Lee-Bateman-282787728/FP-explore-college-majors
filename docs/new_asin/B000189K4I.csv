8007641,3,B000189K4I,"This is not really an instructinal DVD it is more of a history lesson about the Fender Stratocaster Guitar and its rise from the early 50's to today.
Tom Kolb explains such mundane things as the Bridge section of the guitar and control knobs, tremelo,pickup's...ect. But the highlite is when he plays in different styles such as Jeff beck, Eric Clapton,Ritche Blackmore,and other great Strat players. Fun to watch if you are a huge Strat fan like me... but may bore others who were hopping to glean some riff's off of this DVD.
After watching this dvd you do realize just how important the Strat has been to Rock and music in general. Its the only true example i can think of where they got something right the first time! the body and structure of the Srtat has not changed in 60 years....thats beacause it was perfect to begin with.",1194825600,2,834,4.566666666666666
8007642,1,B000189K4I,"I've played keyboard for over 25 years. I've now decided to start playing guitar and purchased this video. No doubt that Tom Kolb knows how to play a guitar. If I didn't have any previous musical knowledge I would have been completely lost watching this DVD.

What it shows to you is a bunch of information about various styles of various guitar players. That's what it is suppose to do right? Well what is shown to you is a guy playing his guitar really fast and talks about nothing on how to apply techniques and use them. Then you are referred to look at a cheezy photocopied handbook that is suppose to explain everything. Wrong! Every ""technique"" that is shown... if you can pick it out during his fast playing... would already be known by an experienced player. Beginner.... forget it, you won't see anything that will help you.

I could go on for hours on how useless this video is. But I'll keep it short. Spend your money on something else.",1186444800,3,949,4.511627906976744
8007643,5,B000189K4I,"This DVD features Tom Kolb demonstrating the styles and techniques of many of the famous strat playing greats such as Eric Johnson, Dick Dale and Eric Clapton to name a few.  Fantastic for any strat fan.",1143158400,,203,4.638888888888889
8007644,4,B000189K4I,"this video and the accompanying booklet provide great insight for the beginner or experienced player to the equipment spec's., and details of special tunings, chord-voicings and techniques of the most prominent and enduring telecaster driven superstars.  i have not been able to find a second, or follow-up volume to this video (an effort well-warranted).  nonetheless, if you're looking for a launching point from which to delve further into the playing of superstars like danny gatton, james burton, johnny lang, albert lee, kieth richards, and andy summers- this is money and time well spent.",1030147200,2,595,5.387096774193548
