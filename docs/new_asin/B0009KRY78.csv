2299491,5,B0009KRY78,"Let me start by saying that I guess I would fall into the begginner category...Iused to exercise like 2 hours a day (ten years ago) and then when I started studying just sort of let that all fall away (completely). So about a month now I have gotten back into exercising, I started with the dance cardio cause I LOVE latin and ballroom dance and wanted something to entice me back into the world of cardio...that worked....and was looking for diversity with a workout that packs a kick....my brother suggested this....I did the Taebo Cardio first and it was definitely doable so I decided to test myself with this. I made in through the workout , only stopped like twice on some long reps....but I felt  good and energised....I think it is a good bridge begginner to intermediate workout....Once I feel more comfortable  with it I can put even more energy into it. But I like Billy, he makes me want to work out and I was sweating...
Go for it...or as Billy says 'Feel the music, feel the burn'
You feel good you made it through the workout.",1207008000,4,1041,4.502645502645502
2299492,5,B0009KRY78,"I love this workout! Very energetic, a good mix of step, weights and kicks. I used 2 lb dumbells (they use 1 pounders) and I thought the 2's would be way too light, but when you start repeating the moves and going straight into other moves without stopping, your arms can really feel it. My only complaint would be the fast stepping, but after a few times it's doable. I felt energized after this workout and will definitely try to do this 3 to 4 times a week. Oh, and Billy can sing pretty darn good too!!!",1205193600,4,507,4.237113402061856
2299493,5,B0009KRY78,"Billy uses a step in this workout, but says you can do it without.  I do it without a step (I don't like step) and still work up a sweat!  This interval workout uses weights as well to tone your upper body, and of course there are the ever-popular kicks for the lower body.  Billy actually manages to work both sides of the body with equal reps in this workout!  Additionally, he is a little goofy/playful, singing along with the music and generally bringing some fun to this workout.  I love it!",1187481600,8,496,4.3478260869565215
2299494,3,B0009KRY78,"I have been doing Tae Bo for years at the gym where it all started.  I bought a few of these DVDs for days that i can't get down to the gym (when my little kids won't let me) and this one is OK. The work out is good. Not too hard and not too easy but not really high energy enough for me. I want to be sweat soaked and tired when I'm done.  The music is kinda boring and there are so many stalls for showing off the next move,that I lose momentum.  For someone just starting out, it might be perfect!",1186531200,6,500,3.7884615384615383
2299495,5,B0009KRY78,"This is a great workout for everyone, it has everything from cardio, step and light weights, it's a little fast in the begining, but once you have mastered the workout it's great, I have been doing Taebo for years and this is one of the best workout routine I have ever done, my teenage daughter also enjoys this workout very much.",1148256000,15,331,4.442622950819672
2299516,3,B0009KRY78,"I only did this workout once mainly because I don't own an exercise step. I found it a little awkward to do some of the exercise without the step. overall, it probably would be a pretty good workout if you used the equipment with it. I have several other Taebo videos I prefer over this for that reason.",1326931200,,303,4.241379310344827
2299517,3,B0009KRY78,"I got the double DVD,hopefully I'm reviewing the right one here, and the insane abs is boring and it is not challenging enough like the bootcamp abs are. With the bootcamp abs at least I can still feel my stomach hurt for a couple of days. With the TaeBo Extreme I got tired of doing all the butterflys. Billy does keep you going but when he starts talking about the beat of the music and asking us at home can we feel the beat the music is a bit off from what kind of exercise were actually doing. Don't get me wrong I love doing TaeBo and I'm not complaining its my review and I find both DVD's not challenging enough like his bootcamps are.",1323648000,,643,4.152
2299518,5,B0009KRY78,"I LOVE this DVD. As a fitness enthusiast, sometimes it can be hard to find a DVD that actually gives a great workout. This one delivers. It is very fast paced, but in between the fast paced sections are some places where he slows it down (intervals). And a great DVD to start off with, because you won't ""outgrow"" it. As we all know, in fitness your body easily acclimates itself within a short period of time. If you start off with a basic or slow DVD you will quickly find it no longer challenges you. This one is very challenging to a beginner, but you can adjust your pace, maybe do just the legs in the beginning, or do half-time (so it's not as fast), wear weighted gloves, etc.. to make it more challenging. It's one you can work up to. The steps can be a little tricky for those less coordinated (i.e. me!) so it takes a little time to get the moves but once you get them down, it is a lot of fun, almost like dancing.",1311638400,,926,4.15
2299519,3,B0009KRY78,"If you're familiar with Billys dvds you know he does, in and out as one of his cardio moves. Well be prepared to do that about half of the dvd!
No joke! But it is a pretty good pace.",1300233600,3,182,3.6923076923076925
2299520,4,B0009KRY78,I am a fan of taebo workouts and this video proved to be an excellent choice. It is easy to follow and will be resourceful for even a beginner. I would definitely recommend this video to others!,1280275200,,194,4.27027027027027
2299521,4,B0009KRY78,"This is mostly the classic Tae Bo, but they changed things up in this workout and use a step and 1 lb. weights, I believe.  For some reason the back of the box says that optional equipment are weighted gloves, weighted ball, and a step.  They don't use the gloves or ball however, so not sure where those come in...  Using the step makes this a good workout and the weights add some intensity.  Billy is very energetic in this video and gets kinda crazy during parts of the workout - starts singing and dancing, but I personally don't mind it.  It makes it fun for me to see his enthusiasm, but it may bother some people.  It's a good one for intermediate Tae Bo lovers, but not quite as much cardio as I like.",1278288000,,710,4.222222222222222
2299522,5,B0009KRY78,"Wanted to add a new dvd to my tae bo collection, so got this one. I love it! It's a bit different style  but very fun. He does a little of everything with this one. I use weighted hand gloves the whole workout instead of weights some portion of it. Your arms will really feel the burn.",1272153600,2,285,4.0
2299523,5,B0009KRY78,"I have a very extensive library of fitness dvds and I've been going through some of my favorites lately in order to pass em along in reviews...This is one I turn to often, especially after the holidays when I want to drop any extra pounds super fast.

CALORIE BURN: I wear a bodybugg and display monitor to measure my daily calorie burn which also allows me to measure how many calories I burn during a specific workout, as well as how many I burn per minute during the workout. I mention this only so you'll know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion. This dvd ranked at the tippy top of my exercise dvds on calorie burn. (and I own WAAY more fitness dvds than I should) Obviously, the exact amount of calories burned is different for everyone based upon your height, weight, muscle density, etc but it goes without saying if you only want to own one dvd I would be comfortable saying this is a good one for all it offers.  I have other tae bo dvds I love but they don't equal this caloric burn.

Want more burn? Here's a ranking of how to rev it:
1. For great calorie burn, use the dvd alone
2. For better calorie burn, add weighted gloves (this is what he wears...even light ones help build arm muscles and burn some more calories due to working harder on the same moves.)
3. They show a step in the dvd and it's really nice that this is optional. He does a routine that purposefully is meant to still be easy to follow along without a step but I burned far more calories with it, of course.
4. To burn even more calories, replace your step with a Bosu since it uses more muscles (I ditched my step when I got one.)
5. To burn the most combine weighted gloves with a step or Bosu.

TONING: The beauty of Tae Bo is that you get cardio combined with toning but this ""Extreme workout"" lives up to its name. The sheer act of kicking and punching elevates your heart in any workout, but Billy Blanks, in my opinion, really has worked his moves out to a great science (I do own several of his in addition to several other kickboxing, tae bo, etc workouts). For example, this is an AMAZING ab workout due to the twists and moves created to engage your obliques. However, whereas most of his other workouts are a continued combo of his moves, he steps this up a notch in fat burning with fast moves and the addition of the optional step which really gets your heart rate up. Coupled with the strength training that builds muscle in order to burn more calories even while at rest and continue burning calories and revving your metabolism long after the workout...it's more complete than any dvd I can think of.

WEIGHTS: Typically in workouts whenever they say to use your ""light weights"" I am just fine using my heavier ones. Not so in this one. If you have no weights, it's no problem...he suggests simply grabbing a couple of water bottles. But you'll do so many reps while you are doing Tae Bo that light weights was really all I could handle ( I used 3 lbs each).  You can start off with no weights at all and the weights are only in the second part of the program.  But it's great for toning along with the rest of his body toning simply using your body weights

The beauty of Tae Bo is that you are blasting calories due to the high heart rate, yet you are also toning. You'll feel it and you'll get results. Double the results. I love that.

INSTRUCTION: I have several of Billy Blanks' dvds for a reason...he has great energy, it doesn't feel like a workout becase it's actually fun, and he always has exceptional workouts that scorch calories and tone well. I happen to love the counting down he does along with his group because it enables you to know you are to tempo and not have to stare at the tv the whole time if desired. It's also energizing. His cueing is excellent as even a beginner would never miss a step. Trust me, I have NO coordination in spite of the fact I workout often so cueing that's good is very, very important to me. I like that he provides a studio that's full of people. (This one is even more full than many of his others.) Keeps it interesting for me. That said, they were all fairly fit because it's difficult to do tae bo and not be in shape fairly quickly...this hits all the muscles.

CUEING: I am totally a clutz when trying to follow cueing and coordinate steps so this is ALWAYS the first thing I look for in workout reviews. All my Billy Blanks dvds offer great instruction that I follow perfectly the first time with no rewinding or stopping thinking ""WHAT was I supposed to do there?"". He very clearly shows you what you are supposed to do and makes it easier to do by working out as a mirror image...easiest way to follow in my opinion.

LEVEL: Tae Bo is inherently designed that if you know how to kick and punch, you can do it. It's also inherently designed to burn more calories in the same amount of time as a lesser workout...kicking and punching elevates your heart rate more even if you are merely kicking and punching the air.  You'll burn calories and firm up even if you workout daily. I feel this one even though I workout often but if I go for weeks without a workout I can still jump in and do it. On most of his dvds I wear my weighted gloves through the whole workout, but this one works you so much harder that I usually only make it half way before I take off the gloves.  Because the cueing and instruction is great, you can jump in and do tae bo on this one even if you never have before. In fact, the first Tae Bo I ever did was a short Billy Blanks dvd and it got me hooked.

LENGTH: 56 minutes. But even a 20 minute workout with this one is good. This one is longer than most of his other dvds so you can break it up however you wish or get one major workout.

MUSIC: Excellent and upbeat, not the boring electronica I often hear in fitness dvds. You move to the beat.

SET: A very nice studio, full of people so there's many to follow and it's visually interesting. Varied shapes and sizes. Men and women.

ENERGY: Due to the instruction and team, it's through the roof. You know how, after you've done a set of reps that were tough, and the count is over you just wanna yell ""AAAAAAAH!"". They do. As a group. It pumps you up and I can't really even say why. Tons of energy here in so many ways. Billy just spills excitement for what he's doing. It seems contagious.

NEGATIVES: This is one of my favorite workouts that I own so I'm reaching to find a negative on this one...it is fun to do, gets uber results so I have no negatives on the dvd. I think this is an old one though based upon Billy's funky Billy Idol style outfit though. Not that that matters much but it's kinda funny. (giggle) But it's also always obvious in all the Billy Blanks dvds that they film this all day and have to do retakes because by the end of the dvd even though you'll be sweating, this team literally is grossly wet. This one was particularly odd because two of the women in front had on light colored pants and the crotch sweat (I'm sorry but you can't help but notice) was so bad it was dripping and created an enormous stain just in the crotch of their pants.  This still grosses me out a little... Look, I've seen workout dvds being filmed and they break to cool down or change clothes. I know time is money and all and who wants to stop and waste time...but you can't look away when the only person on camera at times looks like they wet their pants. :-) Trust me, it is in no way subtle. I feel for this team. They must have been doing this routine for like 8 hours with the cuts they inevitably have to make when filming...they are literally slinging sweat with no towels and they make me thankful I am in my own workout room. Alone. Still, if you can avert your eyes who cares if they make ya burn calories. And they do.

ALTERNATIVES: These are some other workouts I like if you decide this one isn't for you that utilize Tae Bo or kickboxing for good results. These are all solid but not quite as much of a workout in that they burn slightly less calories and aren't quite as ""extreme"", but they are worth noting:

8062980,4,B0009KRY78,"Billy Blanks' Tae Bo Extreme: Push Your Limits is a good workout that will burn calories and at the same time help strengthen your core.

The usual kicks and punches are enhanced with the use of a low step--Blanks suggests beginners do not use the step until they have mastered the exercises to the point where your stomach is tightened and you are aware that the movements of your arms and legs have reached a certain controlled precision. The use of the step is incorporated into the routine for about ten minutes; it is also used for some floor work which includes push-ups.

In addition, Billy uses light weights--which, of course, can be increased depending upon your need requirements for resistance. The weights ramp up  a fairly extensive sequence of arms exercises that are streamlined into the workout after some rapid kicks and knee lifts repetitions.

All in all, Tae Bo Extreme covers all the bases in a 52 minute format.  The warm-up includes Billy's typical stretching movements and then quickly goes into a moderate cardio routine with Billy's signature fast and slow sequences.  The music kicks in to introduce the faster paced segment and Billy does a good job of keeping it moving without his usual breaks in the action that can become tedious. The cool-down is a bit shorter than his norm, but this works to keep the DVD from going on too long.  The motivational talk at the end is kept to a minimum also.

Bottom line?  Tae Bo Extreme is a good addition to your Tae Bo collection of DVDs. If you like Billy and his team, more than likely you will enjoy this video which I would rank as a good overall workout that does not profess to be an ultimate cardio routine but instead covers all the bases in a 50 minute plus format.  Recommended.

This video is now one of my favorites, I like the fact that that show the moves with the step and without if you don't own one. You will definitely be sweating by the time you are done with this video.

I have been doing Tae Bo since it first came out on VHS and I am still a fan because they work. While I consider myself in good shape and workout 6 days a week, a few times I had to get off the step or I modified by taking out the arm movements so I could keep up.

The floor work for your thighs is killer but so effective and I would recommend this video to anyone wanting a switch from regular tae bo and wanting to push yourself.",1342137600,,772,3.842767295597484
