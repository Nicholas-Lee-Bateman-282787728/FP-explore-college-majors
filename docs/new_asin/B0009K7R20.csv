2295971,2,B0009K7R20,"We expected more from NG.  These videos were mostly just quick clips of various creatures, 5 seconds for most, and very little informational content.  Good to plop the kids in front of if you want to distract them, not good at all for learning.",1195257600,10,244,4.5227272727272725
2295972,3,B0009K7R20,"My kids do enjoy watching these. However, the little cartoon globe, it's quite cheesy.  Although educational, we don't watch it often.",1193529600,3,134,5.380952380952381
2295973,2,B0009K7R20,"This DVD set was disappointing in it's presentation and delivery;  especially the dino video, and my son was looking forward to that one most.  The ""filler"" silly humor is a waste of film space - I think I'd rather purchase an adult version of a National Geographic documentary.  Flashing disjointed scenes of various dinosaurs to some kind of rap I suppose the producers deemed kid-friendly was not appealing to my 6 yr. old at all.  He kept asking when the show was actually going to start.  Overall, it's not a ""bad"" set...it's just not worth the money.  Turn on the Discovery Channel instead.",1183593600,17,596,4.737864077669903
2295974,1,B0009K7R20,"I have been looking for educational dvds on aminals for my 3 year old son.  I was completely shocked with the dinosaur dvd...he is scared to death of it...they could have talked about so many things besides the fact that they eat each other!  EVEN the ocean dvd has a couple of scenes that scare him...i showed another mother and she gave them right back to me, saying they were way to violent and NOT age appropriate for young children...Does anyone make a dvd where there is no violence or death of something for young children besides einstein?",1171065600,7,547,4.571428571428571
2295975,5,B0009K7R20,"I bought this beautiful series of children's National Geographic DVDs for a friend's son.  I didn't see it myself, but I have some of the National Geographic films in my library and I know they were excellent.  Children who are educated to appreciate the natural world are more likely to become useful citizens of the future generation.",1167782400,2,336,4.87719298245614
2295976,5,B0009K7R20,I bought this DVD set for my son (5) and daughter (4) and they absolutely love it and I find myself watching as well.  It has beautiful animal scenes and is very educational as well.  Good buy!,1153353600,8,193,4.1891891891891895
2295977,5,B0009K7R20,"I got these for my 12-year-old nephew. I was worried that they'd be too juvenile for him, but he loved them! He watched them all within days of getting them. My sister told me that I was ""right on"" with this gift. If you know any kids that love animals - this will be the perfect gift for them also! I felt sort of guilty getting acclaim for picking out such a simple gift! National Geographic makes this set seem like it's a lot more than it is. It's not just ""some DVD's about animals"" to him, and I'm sure it will bring a smile to any little face!",1148947200,10,550,4.055045871559633
2295978,4,B0009K7R20,"This is probably one of the best wild animal collections I have found that is suitable for a preschooler.  My 3yr old son received this as a gift for his 3rd birthday and absolutely loves it.  The DVD's are informative without being too explicit.  No zebras being eaten here! If you aren't sure about buying all four, I would definately recommend the Deep Sea Dive (for the fish fans) and Swinging Safari (for the wild animal fans).",1141603200,33,432,4.584415584415584
2295979,5,B0009K7R20,"We have watched this series of videos from the time our son was just over 1 year old. They have held his attention for the past 4 years now, and his Mom and I have enjoyed them as well. We would have to credit this series for being a big part of our junior scientist's long lasting interst in and knowledge of animals, the environment, geography, and biology. He learned all the continents and major (many minor as well) countries from the series and from seeking additional information from us and the library. We now have the entire series on DVD and they continue to be among his favorite videos (along with National Geographics' Kratt Brothers). If you love animals and want good quality, educational material for your toddler/pre-k/1st-2nd grade young one, you can't go wrong with this series!",1135641600,55,798,4.748201438848921
2295980,4,B0009K7R20,My two year old loves these movies. The best movie is the Swinging Safari.  The other three aren't as good.  One good thing about them is they have extra movies in the special features that are really good.  They are about as long as the actual movie.  I recommend them to all parents who have kids that like animals.,1126396800,12,317,4.322033898305085
2295981,2,B0009K7R20,"I did not like this dvd set because I thought it was going to show more animals in detail and explain what they do and how they live, this dvd just flashes animals across the screen and says very little. I was disappointed in it. I want to sell  it to someone else",1370908800,,264,3.981132075471698
2295982,5,B0009K7R20,My four year-old daughter loves to watch these and the boxed set is a great value.  She will choose these over princess favorites and I much prefer them as well.,1370476800,,161,4.366666666666666
2295983,5,B0009K7R20,"My 4 year old and 2 year old grandchildren always ask to watch Spin when they come for a visit. Wonderful photography, quick paced, and very informative.",1368316800,,153,4.703703703703703
2295984,5,B0009K7R20,"These movies are the best of the best for children as well as adults.  I purchased all but the dinosaur one on VHS for my youngest son when he was maybe 4 years old and he is now 22.  Our granddaughter inherited his set when she was maybe 4 or 5.  She absolutely loved them.  Over the years the movies were misplaced, so for a Christmas gift this year I purchased 2 sets on DVD.  My son and daughter said that they were the best Christmas gifts ever!",1357689600,,450,4.068181818181818
2295985,5,B0009K7R20,Another wonderful video by National Geographic.  The footage is fascinating and exciting as are all National Geographic films.  The photography is fantastic and this video will be watched over and over again by everyone.  I never hesitate to purchase videos offered by Nat Geo as they all are beautiful and suitable for any age to watch and thoroughly enjoy.  A beautiful MUST HAVE film!!,1353715200,,388,5.015625
2295986,2,B0009K7R20,"Our children love Animal Planet, but we don't like the commercials on television. We thought this would be a good alternative; however, the style of these shows are so rapid, bouncing from one clip to the next that the children don't really get an in-depth idea about the animals. These are too cutesy and the narration is odd. If your children are really into animals these may seem a bit limited for their appreciation. For what it's worth, our oldest is 3 & 1/2 and she loves to watch the real animal shows. We were looking for an alternative that would provide her quality information about animals without the commercials. Unfortunately what we've ended-up with is an oddly watered down ""kids"" video about animals. Our son, 18 months, seems to like the ""dance"" portion of each video, though.",1351814400,3,796,4.77536231884058
2295987,5,B0009K7R20,"I was given this series of four videos as a gift from my mother-in-law.  I currently teach first grade and have used these many times to discuss habitats, animals, and predators/prey. The students from my inner city school do not get to go to the zoo or vacation away from local areas.  Many times, these videos are the first time they have seen documentary-like footage of animals.  They love them! I often have to stop the video because of the questions and desire to learn more.  I would recommend this video to anyone who loves documentaries.  Dudley makes learning fun for the kids too! And I disagree with the review regarding the out of date songs. My kids go home singing them!!",1337990400,,686,4.590163934426229
2295988,5,B0009K7R20,"Very fast shipping
Nat Geo's really wild animals is great for kids who are interested in all kinds of animals, my son who is 8, loves the series.",1337126400,,145,4.214285714285714
2295989,2,B0009K7R20,"My 3.5 year old has become very interested in ocean and wildlife and has watched a couple of adult national geographics and loved them. I bought this set hoping that some of the more frightening material would be omitted and that the tapes would be more age appropriate overall. I'm a bit disappointed. The videos are narrated by an animated spinning globe with a lot of kid rock type original music, numerous film cuts and at points the tapes just become so frenetic that they are downright agitating. It's as if National Geographic went overboard assuming kids have absolutely no attention span or interest in really learning about animals. The Rainforest is the best as I can tell, not too annoying. But in all the videos, short segments of educational footage are interspersed with gimmicky loud ones--e.g., on the dinosaurs video (which has very few dinosaurs) there is a very long ""mock-black and white horror movie"" segment with vampire footage that is just downright inappropriate for this kind of video and unnecessary. The point is to illustrate that vampire bats aren't really vampires, but the whole thing is overwrought. My son didn't know anything about vampires, but thanks to National Geographic, now he does. If I am able to return these I will. National Geographic should give kids a little more credit.",1330387200,8,1321,4.954954954954955
2295990,5,B0009K7R20,"My kids absolutely love this set; almost too much as I can recite about every word of the narration.  Its perfect for their attention span, showing images of the animals that most kids love, explaining important but simple facts with music incorporated. And most importantly, it manages to leave out the gore, but explain the circle of life and how some animals prey on others. I can't say that they are enamored with the dinosaur version, but the other 3 are huge hits.",1329436800,,470,4.662650602409639
2295991,5,B0009K7R20,"I have even more of National Geographic's Really Wild Animals. Your host Spin, the cartoon globe, guides you through different habitats showing you the different animals that live there, including prehistoric creatures. The songs in these programs are extremely catchy! I could sing and dance to them long after the programs are up. Any animal/cartoon lover should have this in their home. Not only is it educational, but also very entertaining as well. Buy this!",1314576000,,463,5.1866666666666665
2295992,4,B0009K7R20,"I have this series on VHS and we LOVE IT.  My kids have had it since they were 3 and 2 and now they are 6 and 5 and I am upgrading to the DVD version!  They don't every get bored with it and they learn a lot. Honestly I love it too. The songs are great and the video is beautiful... just what you would expect from national geographic. I don't have to worry about animal mating or eating one another and the facts are straight.  That said, I am a Christian and I believe in Creation. I have had to therefore weed a few of the videos out of our collection. I thought because my kids were well grounded they would just shrug it off as I would, but I am an adult and my filter works a little better than theirs. We were talking about kangaroos once and my daughter said, ""Mom did you know that all kangaroos once lived in trees and most of them jumped out of the trees except one kind..."" So we no longer have the ""Down Under"" video... that said, We still LOVE THEM!  The other video series we enjoy is Zoo Life with Jack Hannah... it's a little dated and has the same need to weed out the evolution, but they too are great and keep your kids learning and intrigued!  Hope you enjoy the videos!",1303430400,2,1191,4.051063829787234
2295993,4,B0009K7R20,"My 7 month old didn't like these videos at first viewing them when he was 5 months, but we kept introducing them slowly and now he watches the ""really wild animals"" everyday. Thats the one to buy if you can only afford to buy one. He doesn't like the others in the set yet, gets scared of the sharks but i think can handle them in a few more months. I'll let you know.",1285891200,,368,3.9864864864864864
2295994,5,B0009K7R20,My sons are 5 and 8 years old and have truly enjoyed these DVD's for over 3 years now. All 4 DVD's are both entertaining and educational. The songs are cute. I think the price is fantastic for what you get and this DVD set makes a great gift for children 3-6 years old.,1259020800,2,269,4.0

2296000,4,B0009K7R20,"National Geographic standards applied to the younger age group. Fabulous photography, age appropriate information, and very catchy songs. Well packaged and each one consistently a quality production. The only downside is they didn't make more of this series.",1209513600,3,258,5.815789473684211
8062238,3,B0009K7R20,Seller delivered!! Fast shipping. Entertaining DVD but narrator iritating!  Annoying commentary and distracting.  Not the best format for learning!  Too fast and fragmented.,1495065600,,173,6.434782608695652
