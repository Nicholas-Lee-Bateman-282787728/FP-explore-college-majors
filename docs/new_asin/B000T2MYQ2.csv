The 2007 release is exactly the same as the 2011.
This is the same old VHS sourced DVD that is so common.
A crappy videotape on DVD looks like a crappy videotape on DVD.
This film deserves better.
I look forward to a careful restoration.

Maybe someday.

Some of the best films are the most ignored and this is one.",1513555200,,338,4.435483870967742
8207591,5,B000T2MYQ2,"Why isn't this movie available for streaming or on DVD? I first stumbled on it on cable (Cinemax) many years ago. Haunting film that get's under your skin. Crispin Glover is excellent!...plays a .very flawed, lost character who loves art, music, poetry, and longs to be seen as an artist himself, to the point of stealing credit for some real heartfelt, original, highly mature poetry from a mute poet friend who is so isolated and lonely, he doesn't seem to mind Crispin stealing his work and getting all of the undeserved glory. A movie with very serious undertones and a study of insecurities among creative people on various levels. I think it's a great film.  Crispin Glover's best performance in my opinion! I miss seeing it since it is only available on worn out VHS tape...A Shame!!!",1501632000,,791,4.773722627737226
8207592,4,B000T2MYQ2,"The quality of the video is marginal but watchable. The background of music by DeBussy is wonderful. The simplicity of expectation is unique. This is not a film for everyone. However, if you grew up with something missing and noticed yourself drifting, in the post teen years or well beyond, there is a tale here to relate to with an ethereal component to sort of guess at to maybe answer the question of why it all had to be this way. this is a simple yet complex, rather miraculous film which I'd love to see show up on DVD with better sound especially instead of some of the garbage they are dredging for that medium. I can watch this film over and over and never quite get it or get enough of it.",1049846400,10,700,4.2706766917293235
