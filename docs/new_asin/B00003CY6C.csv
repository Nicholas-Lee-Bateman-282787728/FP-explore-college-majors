1294345,5,B00003CY6C,"If you were a fan of American Pie, this is a ""must see""!  The story picks up a year later, after the gang's first year of college, but the gross-outs and the laughs pick up right where they left off.  I suggest seeing American Pie before viewing American Pie 2. If you don't, you'll still enjoy lots of laughs, but the first film goes a long way toward setting up the story lines for the sequel. Everyone's back... even Stiffler's Mom... and pretty much everyone gets what they're looking for!  I had to see it twice in the theatre.  My sides hurt for hours!  Were we ever really that awkward?!?!  Watch it and have fun.",1004486400,,620,4.3478260869565215
1294346,5,B00003CY6C,"When I saw the first movie, I thought it sucked bigtime! Not only because it was just not mature at all, it was just of the not so intelligent nature.
The second movie on the other hand, still has that macho male humour, but does have room for some romantic, and touching moments as well. The movie is so much better than the first movie, that this is in fact the first time I think in my history of movies that a sequal is better than the first movie.
Plenty of laughs, adrenaline pumping music and behaviour, but also with a pinch of romance, and heart which the first movie lacked.
Great movie, with a ""parental discression should is advised"" note",1004140800,,650,4.380165289256198

Jim is in his college room. His roommates have already moved out. He is in bed with Natalie (Joelle Carter) who wants to have sex.  Finally! Is this it?  Will Jim finally get to score?  It will only be his second time. The legs are up. Jim is in position. But oh no.  His father (Eugene Levy) comes through the door in a surprise visit. Hearing his father's voice, in reaction, Jim hits his head on the wall. Then his mother (Molly Cheek) walks in. She drops a piece of apple pie in Tupperware on the floor. Seeing Jim with Natalie, she is horrified. Then Natalie's parents (Larry Drake, Lee Garlington) come into the room.
 Not a good sexual experience for Jim to remember. No score.
  It's the end of the first college year. Jim and his friends, Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) are back in their hometown.  Everyone had a sexual experience in college.
  There might still be some luck for Jim. Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) calls him and wants to see him at the end of summer.

1294854,3,B00003CY6C,"Everybody is back and gave a good effort, but most scenes are too setup to be enjoyable. The movie seemed lackluster and draggy with no real focus like the first Pie had. Would've liked the gang completely in a college setting for number 2.",1397606400,,240,4.4772727272727275

1294860,5,B00003CY6C,"This is one of my favorites, if not my favorite American Pie film. It is absolutely hilarious and worth your time. Before you watch this film, watch the original American Pie movie first so that this film makes more sense. This is the sequel to American Pie.

I definitely suggest watching all four movies in order. (American Pie, American Pie 2(this one), American Wedding, and American Reunion) They have the same cast for each movie and the movies build on each other. The spinoffs (Naked Mile, Band Camp, and Beta House) have different cast members but the same general theme. The three spinoff movies are also funny, but not nearly as good as the other four.

If you watch the unrated version, do prepare yourself for nudity.

I have watched this movie a few times and it makes me laugh every time.",1386374400,2,803,4.640845070422535

1295160,3,B00003CY6C,"This movie goes to the edge of the rating scale simply because the direction is terrible.  Director Rogers takes on this film like a child with his first shotgun.  There is extraordinarily poor taste in humor and even worse transitions to other scenes. I left the movie feeling embarrassed for the actors that had to endure such incredible lack of direction along with such a paltry story line.  It is clear that this movie could have been great like the first one, but when things didn't work out performance-wise, suddenly a bit of nudity had to be thrown in along with crass humor.  What made the original so nice was that it wasn't all in-your-face-poor-taste-sexual-suggestiveness.  The original was suggestive, but the key was to leave it up to your imagination, and give the scene opportunity to play itself out in your mind.  Unfortunately, this move had none of that appeal.

Funny parts and reprised roles make this movie bearable.  Jason Biggs (Jim) pulls his own weight, as well as Thomas (Finch) and Levy (Jim's Father) who is brilliant once again.  Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) does an overall good job with the dialogue, but appears at times that she gets unfamiliar with the character.  Tara Reid and Shannon Elizabeth look awful and could have used a little more work in the makeup room.

If you go see this movie, be prepared for all-out crudity and don't expect the same performance quality.  Although this movie may appeal to die-hards, most of the teens out there and some others, it was a disappointment to me.  Still, I liked many parts, but just didn't think it even came close to measuring up to the first.  Perhaps if the Weitz brothers had directed it, this movie would have been as good as the first.  But hey, mistakes happen.",1355097600,,1753,4.758278145695364

Like the original film, this movie plays like a series of awkward and embarrassing sexual moments for its cast.  Its like each scene is a new comedic sexual mishap.  My favorite scene is the one involving the ""lesbians"" who promise the boys some hot lesbian action if the boys play along with their game.  The two actresses who play them are incredibly good looking and are the hottest women in the film by far.  They were certainly a pleasure to watch.  Stiffler seems to have a larger role in this installment and he is probably my favorite character.  The guy is hilarious! Eugene Levy returns as Jim's Dad and continues to embarrass Jim to death at the worst possible times.

1295246,3,B00003CY6C,"The one detractor I have with the `American Pie' films (or at least the first two) is that they don't ware well.  I say `the first two' mainly because the third feature film (and the subsequent `straight to video' sequels) is atrocious even the first time.  The first two films are enjoyable in their own right the first go around, but neither film has true `repeat power'.  In other words; when you watch it the second time you struggle to remember why you raved it the first.  They just don't age with grace.  The laughs aren't as consistent the second go around, and while some say that this sequel is a peg above the first, I disagree.  The laughs seem somewhat regurgitated (the superglue scene was a ridiculous attempt to capitalize off of the first films iconic apple pie scene) and the premise seems even more ridiculous.  The first film had some edge to it, and certainly an ample amount of uniqueness.  A second, third and fourth viewing of the original show its flaws, but this second film doesn't need so many chances; you can spot the flaws on the initial viewing.  Still, Jason Biggs had a knack for this kind of humor, and he doesn't disappoint, and Eugene Levy will always be `Jim's Dad' and for that I am grateful, even if his character becomes somewhat one-note over time.  It has a certain degree of fun here, so don't begrudge it before you see it, but once is more than enough.",1304380800,,1398,4.511904761904762
1295247,4,B00003CY6C,"I deliberately held off reviewing American Pie 2 for the last nine years because I simply couldn't appreciate it back then. You see, back in 2001 a movie focusing around a bunch of college students partying, getting drunk and hooking up with chicks just seemed pretty pointless and a waste of tape to me. It's not a strong enough idea for a storyline.  I still honestly believe that, however the storytelling here is at *least* better than most of the college comedies being passed off as top of the line humor these days.

Oh and it's definitely true that the entirety of American Pie 2 is filled to the brim with typical immature college humor. Some of it definitely feels like total fluff to me.

However at least it has certain hilarious scenes to save the film from utter disaster such as a trumpet solo during a band performance, a super glue ""tough time"" in the bedroom involving one of the guys, a certain somewhat overlong walkie talkie moment that the entire town happens to overhear, and countless little jokes here and there that barely bring my overall rating to a 4 out of 5. Just barely.

On the flipside, at least the girls are really attractive (especially that one redhead and the girl with a European accent- oh man to be a teenager again!) and the soundtrack is pretty good. Most of the songs used in the movie reflect the time period in which they were created and released, so the memories are nice.

Just a barely passable style of comedy though. Calling it ""movie of the year"" or whatever is a gross exaggeration.",1289952000,,1537,4.574545454545454

The film centers on four best friends who embark on a camp during their first summer after their freshman year at college. Not Oscar worthy by any means, the movie is filled with sex crazed teenagers who drink and simply try to have a good time with hilarious results. Seann William Scott, who had a minor role in the original, steals the film as the funny and foul-mouthed Stifler and Scott would go on to a wonderful movie career because of this role. There are a ton of bonuses on the DVD including a documentary on the making of ""American Pie 2"", screen tests from the first ""American Pie"", videos, trailers, outtakes, and more.

After a party at Stiflers, that almost exactly resembles the one from the first movie, the gang decides to take their adventures to a beach house and spend the summer there.  While they are trying to find jobs and throw beach parties, the boys have some of their own dilemmas at hand they need to deal with. Jim finds out that Nadia is back in the states after she got booted from them after their internet debacle. Jim has only had sex one and half times since that incident though. So to try and get himself prepared for Nadia, he takes on the aid of Michelle, the band geek that rocked his world from a year ago. As she begins to teach him the ways of sexual behavior, they themselves begin to realize that maybe they are more than they think they are to one another. Kevin, after splitting from Vicky, has to get over his feeling for her once she shows up at the house to have fun. Because for her, they are just friends, which is why she now has a new boy in her life. Oz has to deal with a long distance relationship with Heather since she went away for the summer. It doesn't help though that his best friend Stifler is constantly trying to get him to have sex with any girl within a 3 yard radius of them. Speaking of Stifler, he's still coping with the fact that Finch had sex with his mom last year. And Finch is having withdrawals from not being with Stifler's mom.

For the longest time I thought that part 1 was the better of these 2. I seriously think I've been wrong this whole time. After watching these back to back last night, I can whole heartedly tell you I laughed a lot more with part 2. The jokes are better and even raunchier. The embarrassments Jim go through are hilarious (good god the super glue scene). The girls are hotter. And Stifle maybe just a tad over the top, but is still a lot better in part 2. When he grabs that dildo and shakes it while running through that house, I could not stop laughing. And when he says he forgot where he found it cause of all the excitement from when he found it was just hilarious. The lesbian scene was just laugh out loud funny also.

In the end, I would definitely own this. Just remember though, if you aren't into raunchy and crude comedy, just stay away.

P.S. - There is no way any single straight man would have walked out of that light house without having done something with Nadia. Just no way.",1237334400,2,2462,4.254273504273504

And last but definitely not least, Paul Finch is still obsessed with Steve Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom (Jennifer Coolidge).  This summer (this movie) is packed with sex jokes, hilarious one-liners, and so much more.

1295410,3,B00003CY6C,"As far as sequels go American Pie 2 is no disaster, but it lacks the purpose of the original, and some of its moral grounding. The gang is on break, and decide to rent a beach house and throw a huge party. That's about it. The problem is that while everyone came back for the sequel, most of the cast has nothing to do. Most of the girls are just cameos for the guys to sleep with in the end, and Chris Klein and Thomas Ian Nicholas kind of just stand around. Seann William Scott and Eddie Kaye Thomas had breakout characters in the first one, and here they seem overused. At least Jason Biggs picks up the slack with a developing romance with Alyson Hannigan's character. And Eugene Levy's still a riot.

The dvd is stuffed with multiple commentary tracks, and the packaging flaunts this with ""10 hours of entertainment."" There are also some decent blooper reels and featurettes. American Pie 2 isn't as great as the original, but as a reunion of loveable characters in wacky situations, it's at least worth a rental.",1153440000,3,1018,4.5027027027027025

1295412,5,B00003CY6C,"It usually a given fact that sequels are never as good as the original film and unfortunately with American Pie 2 this is very much the case.

That's not necessarily because the film is particularly worse than the first but some of the stock jokes just don't have the impact as when seeing them for the first time round, and when comparisons can be directly drawn with some of the jokes of the original the second time they are presented that can only come across slightly watered down.

That said it is still an extremely funny and sweet film and one of the best features of this sequel is that it features, to a man, all the main characters from the first film, indeed it doesn't just stop there but also manages to cram in a few of the minor character for good measure also. In many senses it hasn't changed from the original at all, it still has the sweetest nature of all the young-college-brat-frat-gross-out films of its era and still conjures up the most embarrassing situations for its stars. The jokes still make you laugh out loud and the romantic interludes still make you go ""arrrrrhh""

Again another nice touch from the film makers is that they haven't tried to contrive any of the new situations by changing the character traits from the first film. So Oz and Kevin for example aren't changed back into girl hunting lads again, but both struggle with sorting out more permanent relationships. What the film makers have also done though is bring some of the background characters to the fore greatly and let them run away with some of the spotlight. Stifler is a prime example of this. Great also to see bother Jessica (who is again criminally under used) and The Shermanator back for roles.",1151107200,,1705,4.6019736842105265
1295413,4,B00003CY6C,"Once again, the boys from American Pie have reunited to create a raunchy good time.  Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch have returned from their first year of college to rent a beach house for the summer and continue their smutty adventures as only horny teenage boys can.  Having successfully left their virginity in the dust by the time they finished high school, they wish to continue their newfound ""stud status"" by hosting parties at their parentless, ruleless rental property.  Because they can't afford to rent over the summer with just the four of them, they include the irrepresible, incorigable Stiffler.  It makes for some more mishaps, continued adventures in smut and testosterone soaked humor.

Still, this was a good time.  Oz and Kevin's relationships faded into the background, Finch is pinning away for Stiffler's Mom and is planning a tantric encounter if and when he sees her again, and once again Jim was the focus.  Jim, the hapless, lovable loser, is floundering through their situation while the others seem happy and successful.  He is going to be reunited with Nadia, the nubile exchange student whose awkward encounter was accidentally broadcast on the Internet in the last movie (This antic is repeated with Kevin and Stiffler's walkie talkies.).  She had forgotten about it as she still wants to bed Jim, but he discovers that he doesn't want to beautiful Nadia but the band camp geek, Michelle, who hung him out to dry in the first movie.

I give this 4 stars because of the humor, otherwise the story lines were a little too silly and too unbelievable.  I have a hard time believing that any guy in Jim's position would pass up a chance with a girl like Nadia, whether or not he would go back to Michelle.  Kevin seems ernest enough in his value of Tara Reid as a friend even though they are no longer romaniticly linked, but I would have liked to have seen the relationship progress over the years, even weeks.  Oz?  Well, Oz was a happy every guy, but as he continued his realtionship with his girlfriend abroad, there was no drama or challenge.

Jim (Jason Biggs) has learned some stuff over the last two years, and now is anxious for more. The plan: him, Stifler (Sean William Scott), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Kevin (Eddie Kaye Thomas) will rent a summer house in Lake Michigan and invite some of the hottest babes in town over for some fun. Sounds like the perfect plan.

I especially loved the commentary by Mena Suvari (Heather), Jason Biggs (Jim) and Thoman Ian Nicholas (Kevin). This is the first time I've ever heard commentary in a movie that I've enjoyed. It's great to hear the actors comment and tease eachother on their work in such a fun, light hearted way. I kept laughing throughout the whole thing. However, the commentary by Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finch) was extremely boring and pointless. It felt like watching a movie in the theater with someone making random comments every 20 minutes. In other words, his commentary was mostly looooong lapses of silence and then he'd say something random. Maybe the problem was that Eddie did the commentary by himself, maybe if they'd put him with another actor it would've been more lively. It would've been nice if they'd put him with Alyson Hannigan (Michelle) and Sean William Scott (Stifler).

Say that to yourself, Good Sequel. It doesnt sound right.
Well Jim is back again! With Finch, Kevin, Oz and the Stiffmeister. They all have finished their first year of college and are going on a vacation. They all meet each other up at a reunion at Stifflers house. The party is off the hook! Stiffler gets pissed on it so funny. So Kevin calls his brother a few days later to ask him a few questions, so Kev's brother tells him to rent a house at the beach. At the same time Jim gets a phone call from Nadia. She's in New York and she wants to see him. On the internet again? Cumming early again? NO! He's going to invite her up to the beach house.
They get to the house (the gang  (Oz ,Kevin, Finch, Stiffler and Jim)) They get a job there and they have tons and loads of fun they meet a pair of lesbians . They have a party, Jim meets up with Nadia but things DONT go as planned Watch this funny comdey, recommended for all who liked the first.",1074816000,,1254,4.076923076923077

Also, throughout the movie we keep expecting Stiffler's to make it to the scene.  Will she make it?  Eugene Levi is hilarious as Jason Bigg's father, imparting his words of wisdom about everything from pleasing a woman to ensuring that his son's private parts will be in working order when Nadia arrives.",1074729600,,725,4.446969696969697

But the American Pie trilogy definitely aren't Disney movies! I enjoyed this sequel but not as much as the original. OK, all the good characters are back from the first, with Jim's Dad getting a bigger slice of the action in this movie. He was great in the first movie.
However, this movie isn't focused as much on sex as the first one was. They've all lost their virginities now, so I suppose it's still being able to get laid the directors are focusing on. Thankfully, all the cringe-worthy moments have been kept, including the worse one EVER - Stifler thinking he's getting champagne poured on his head and not being able to taste the bubbles. You have to see it to believe it.
You've got the ongoing storyline with Jim and Nadia - and anyone who's seen the third cover of American Pie The Wedding, knows nothing happens there! And one of the sweetest moments happens right at the end of the movie, which paves the way for the third one.
You also see phone sex happening - don't do if you have more than one phone in the house - threesomes, girl on girl action, and nearly some guy on guy action!!!

 The cast are now in college, Jim is gettng himself a piece when his dad comes to pick him and surprises Jim by coming in while his son is having sex. Oh what a embarassing moment, then her parents come in and discover the scene. Oh Jim, first it was the pie, now this.
 Now the crew are going on summer break, Heather is going to Europe for studies, which leaves Oz alone, which is ok since they have a good and steady relationship. Oh then comes Stifner, who leads Oz to one of the classes to see what kind of underwear a certain girl is wearing, it is roses to be more exact. So then the crew comes back home, then like usual, Stifer throws a party with high school seniors mixed with college freshmen, then two girls go to Jim and they say this and I quote: ""Hey I remember you."" Jim then looks at them and says ""Yeah you do?"" ""You were that guy who blew his load all over the internet,"" they start laughing. ""Oh Nadia don't go."" mocking Jim.
Then Stifler gets a girl drunk, and leads her to the back porch for a drink of champange. Then a guy who has to take a piss really badly knocks over one of the flower pots knocking out the girl who was going to spill champange down his face, then the guys starts peeing, and Stifer saids this: ""Oh how did you get it so warm?"" referring to the champange. Then Stifner finds out the truth: he got peed on. The cops shut down the party, and now there is nowhere for them to party, so Kevin talks to his older brother, and tells him about this summer house, so they pack up with Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch going, but there is one problem, they cannot afford the rent for the summer, so they have to bring 'the almighty Stifner'.
So they get the house, and start working for a painting company, and Stifner see's their two clients which they give each other a peck on the cheek, now being Stifer, he thinks that they are LESBIANS! So he sneaks into their room, with Jim and Finch trying to get him out of there, but Kevin says that they are coming back, so they try to distract the girls, but no luck, but in the process Stifner finds a sex toy, and he goes around the house with it in the air. Now they have to hide, and the fun begins. You have to see the movie to understand what I am talking about. Now as they get set up for the party, Nadia is heading to the house to get it on with Jim since last time they coulnt because Jim had a 'little accident', guys know what I am talking about on this one.
Finch is also getting prepared for Stifer's mom, since she told her son that she is coming over, but does not know when. Then the party comes forward. Nadia comes, and Jim finds a new love; Michelle, and he tries to take a couple of lessons from Michelle to make good love to Nadia, but in the process he falls in love with Michelle, and the party continues. All of the guys except for Finch gets laid, but here comes the shock of the end: when they are heading home, a sliver 2002 Mersades pulls up in the driveway, and Finch knows who it is. So Stifner's mom ask him this: ""you wanna get it on?"" Finch replies. ""You better clear your schedule."" He tells the guys he will be back in a couple of days, and Stifner sees the car, asking the guys who was it. ""Oh they were looking for the lake."" Stifner then points to the lake , and he nows knows what happens. The End.",1073347200,,3591,4.099431818181818

The high school students from the original are now college students who are on summer vacation.  Much drama occurs when they rent a summer cabin....with Stifler(Seann William Scott).  All wars and attempted sexual acts have their hilarious outtakes.  This sequel mostly explores Jim (Jason Biggs) trying to win Nadia's (Shannon Elizabeth) heart in time for a party.  Many himulating mistakes teach him where his heart really is.

Well, then you'll be happy to hear that American Pie 2 isn't one of those movies.  The plot, which doesn't play a significant part in either, is different: the four friends, back from their first year of college, have decided to rent a lake house on Lake Michigan and throw the biggest and best party that the town has ever seen.  Also, Jim (Jason Biggs) is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) the hot Czech girl that he almost scored with the previous  year, and he is taking lessons on how to please girls from Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), his prom date.  During these sequences, we, the audience, begin to realize that Jim and Michelle are meant to be, and part of the fun is watching how oblivious they are to it.  But the best part is, the entire cast is back, although, there is a shift in importance of characters.  The four main guys don't change much, but Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) does get a little weirder.  Stifler (Seann William Scott) becomes a bigger character in this one, though.  He still isn't part of the group, but he is in more scenes and he's in on the deal this time.  The girls are a whole different story.  In the first movie, they were given significant screentime and they appeared in scenes by themselves.  Now, the only girl who you can say has ""significant"" screentime is Michelle, the girl (of the five main ones) who had the smallest role in the first one.  Also, there is only one big scene with only girls, and it is with Vicky and Jessica (Tara Reid and Natasha Lyonne).  Michelle is by herself for a few moments at the end, but then Jim arrives to whisk her away.  All in all, this movie is hilarious, just as good, if not better than, the first.

The Hollywood machine cares little about innovation, they only care about dollars.  So when this sorta funny, sorta coming-of-age story called ""American Pie"" makes all kinds of money at the box office, naturally there will be a sequel.  There's still some change under the sofa, after all.
The first film was occasionally funny, half-lighthearted drama, half-""Porky's Revenge""... And with SCTV alumnus Eugene Levy in tow, and Natasha Lyonne as the old soul of the piece, it did a credible enough job to pack us in the theatres,
This movie has nothing appealing about it, and certainly isn't worth owning--the writing (although it was never supposed to be Shakespeare) has degenerated to third-rate Farrelly Brothers cast-offs, and none of the actors are doing more than walking through their parts.  Jason Biggs has the most to do, but you can bet if there's an American Pie 4, he'll be in it.  At this point he knows he's gotta take what he can get.

1295725,4,B00003CY6C,"Everyone knows how sequels go. You take what you had in the first, and you do more of it. This is why I feel that this film is a lot crasser than the wonderful original. While the first film was able to balance the raunch and crudeness with an intelligent script that had heart and some truly hilarious moments, this film doesn't achieve the success of the first. But it is still truly enjoyable. What I like best about this movie, is how it continues the lives of these characters in a normal, realistic manner. The first film showcased the relationships and friendships of young teens in high school, and this one develops the story as they are now older and in college. Once your in college, things change. Some people go down seperate paths, and the bond isn't as strong as it used to be. The film shows this as our friends in the film try to stay together and to have a great summer. The plot(if there is one), is fairly simple and formulaic. Our returning faves, Jim(Jason Biggs), Stifler(Sean William Scott), Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz(Chris Klein), and Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), have finished their first year in college. They decide to get together and have one big summer blow out by staying at a beach house and having fun. The females from the first film join in on the fun. While there, the boys decide to paint houses to earn some extra cash. The females, with the exception of band geek Michelle(the hysterical Alyson Hannigan), seem to take the backseat in this film to the guys. Shannon Elizabeth has a bigger part, but poor Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, and Natash Lyonne seem to just be there to hang around. The development of the relationship between Jim and Michelle is wonderful. One of the bigger highlights of the film. The problem with the film is that it doesn't seem as well structured as the first. It is very competently performed, but the heart of the first film just isn't there. There are some nice scenes with Jim and his dad(the brilliant Eugene Levy), but it doesn't hit the mark like in the original. The raunch factor is there in all it's glory, but it's not as easy to take in this one as it was in the first. It's pushing it too hard. The film is definitley funny, but the spirit just doesn't seem to be there. The upcoming third film sounds as if it will be a lot better. I sure hope so. The best performance in the entire film is from Hannigan as Michelle. She has proven to be a brilliant, emmy worthy actress on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", and her performance is just as solid here. She brings a lot more layers and depth to Michelle here. She is phenomenal and wonderful to watch. The look on her face when she gets in her car after helping Jim get Nadia is priceless. That said, everyone does a good job. They make their characters fun to watch and can really make the audience feel like they are, in certain ways, them and their friends. AP2 is not nuclear science, and while many people are quick to judge and condemn the film, maybe they should just relax a bit and let the young people on screen have fun, and the ones in the audience too. As we will see in AP3, adulthood is just around the corner. Let's enjoy the innocence of youth while it lasts.",1052352000,,3198,4.440476190476191
1295726,1,B00003CY6C,"Ever wonder why women and gays seem to be treated less equally? Well you can thank movies like this one that help contribute to that problem.
This movie helps the overrated view of lesbians even more. Lesbians are normal people like everyone else, but it seems like society has programmed men to think it is one of the definitions of ""sexy."" Lesbians have not become just normal people, but this huge sex symbol. Is this what the gay community wants, for lesbians to be continously exploited? They promote just that in this movie, with the stereotypical view of lesbians today... This not only hurts normal, every-day lesbian women, but also heterosexual women, because this type of stereotpical view helps strengthen sexism in today's culture.
And, ironically (or maybe not) gay men are treated as the exact opposite. The tone in the movie suggests that while the lesbians are extremely sexy and perfectly acceptable, that the idea of two gay men is disgusting and used for humor only...
This movie is EXACTLY how gay society is portrayed by the media. Lesbians sexy and acceptable, gay men disgusting and funny. I KNOW that the whole movie isn't about gay and lesbians, I'm just pointing out a certain aspect of the movie that annoys me to death because the same concept is shoved in my face every day by the media.
Unlike the first ""American Pie,"" this movie did not have an oune of intelligence. I am definitely not a fan of the original, but the levels they sunk to in this movie to outdo the first were [weak], sick, and equaled out to a lot less enjoyable and fun to watch as the original movie. Like someone else said, this was ""re-heated pie."" This was definitely not an improvement. The only enjoyable cast member was Eugene Levy, and as much as I'm a fan of his, it's hard to be in a movie like this.
To close things up, I am not trying to be overanalytical (although I might be too late), but I am just pointing out the obvious. Why does the media portray lesbian women as sexy? Because lesbians make them money. Why does the media portray gay men as disgusting and funny? Because gay jokes sell.

1295732,4,B00003CY6C,"I am using ""American Pie"" in my Popular Culture class so I figured I should check out the sequel.  You have to admit that this is not a sequel that tries to produce a carbon copy of the original.  The first time around there was the ""pact,"" and for round two there is just an attempt to have a good time during the summer.
The entire cast is back for ""American Pie 2"" but there are two major differences in terms of the character dynamics.  First, this is really ""American Pie 2B,"" with the emphasis on the boys rather than a balance between the sexes.  Mena Suvari's Heather is almost down to a cameo and there is only one decent girl talk between Vicky (Tara Reid) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) this time around (on the ""Rule of 3"").  However, there is much more of Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and everybody knows that there is no way I am going to complain about that.  Second, in ""American Pie"" the focus was clearly on the characters of Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas).  But this time around the biggest plot threads have to deal with Jim, Stifler (Seann William Scott), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas).  That shift along is guaranteed to change the dynamic of the film, because you are never going to be able to take Stifler seriously, or Finch, for that matter.
The reason I am using ""American Pie"" in class is because I have not made my mind about that film: it starts off proclaiming itself to be a standard film where a bunch of high school boys try to get laid.  But then along the way it seems the boys learn about love, or at least there is more to sex than getting laid.  But then again, they do get laid.  The same principle is at work in this film at well as there are ""serious issues.""  Can Kevin and Vicky just be friends in the aftermath of their breakup?  Can Oz and Heather survive her being in Spain for most of the summer?  Can Jason make Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) happy when she shows up to see him at the end of the summer?  Can we make it through all the extras on this DVD?
However, the big case study comes in what fans picked as the #1 ""American Pie"" scene ever, the ""lesbian scene,"" where the boys want to see a couple of young women they think are lesbians.  The girls are willing to perform, provided the boys do a little performing themselves.  Again, we are back to the quandary: is this a critique of such adolescent libido or an exploitation of the same?  Or is it just standard Hollywood marketing?  After all there Stifler is still having problems with body liquids and whether he is with another or by himself sex is only one problem after another for Jim.  So, you decide.

I laughed a lot, the general feeling is that the cast is really enjoying themselves and is tuned to the task ahead. Very good indeed.
 heard they are preparing a third one (Called AMERICAN WEDDING, I guess). I hope the third part of the ""trilogy"" be as godd as the frst two movies.
Also, this was  a message to the Wayan Brothers, who [messed] up totally the second SCARY MOVIE. It proved that they could have written a better sequel.",1043625600,6,546,4.29126213592233
1295814,4,B00003CY6C,"I'm not a big fan of sequels.  It's usually a frantic attempt of hollywood to squeeze more big bucks out of a successful first movie, and they usually fail miserably, especially where the story is concerned.  American Pie 2 is no exception in regards to the story.  It has a pretty flimsy plot, and seems to drag some of the gags on a little too long.  However, AP2's gags are even funnier than the original movie!  Which, to me, makes AP2 even more enjoyable than the original!  After all, when I watch movies such as these, I don't really expect any great stories in them.  I only look forward to the laughs, and AP2 delivers superbly!
However, the biggest problem I had with this movie is with a few of the characters.  To be precise, the character of Heather, portrayed by Mena Suvari.  In the original, she was a main character in the story, and played it brilliantly.  In AP2, she's reduced to barely a supporting character, and most of her lines are spoken through phone conversations with ""Oz"".  And what did the producers do to her appearance?  She was extremely cute in the original, but in this movie her appearance is less than appealing, and seems to get worse as the movie progresses.  I know I'm being a bit picky here, but I had to give a reason why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars, and this was the main reason.
However, it certainly doesn't take away from the laughs in the movie.  If you liked the first movie, you'll love this one.  Jason Biggs is the perfect actor to play a guy in which bad and embarrassing things happen to.  Eugene Levy as his father is just as funny in this movie as well.
There will be an American Pie 3 (American Wedding), due for release in August 2003.  I get a sinking feeling that they should've quit while they were ahead, as half the cast will not be in the 3rd movie.  Without all the regular characters, any future sequels can't possibly equal the first 2 movies.  But, I could be wrong - after all, I wasn't expecting a lot from AP2.

This movie tones down the nudity here in the R version.  Although the characters still have hang-ups about sex, it is not the same degree we saw in the first movie.  All of the same characters appear again, but the women from the first movie don't have the presence of the last, with the exception of Alyson Hannigan's character.  It feels as if they were included into the movie as more of an afterthought.
The movie doesn't really offer anything new.  The trailers shown on TV show most of the humor for the movie.  This is something to watch on cable, but I would not recommend buying it.",1040860800,,828,4.3441558441558445

It's exactly a year after they all left each other to go to college and now life seems a little bring considering that they all have nothing to do on their summer vacation. As usual, Kevin comes up with a plan! Rent a house on the beach and have a summer of fun, sex and hilarity!
All of the guys have their respective lives now. Oz has his girl (Mena Suvari), Finch still laments about his one (Stiffler's mom), Kevin wishes he still had his girl (Tara Reid), Stiffler wants to kill Finch and of course, Jim still thinks about Nadia, the one that slipt away. In this one, Jim gets his second chance because out of the blue, Nadia calls him up amd tells him that she'll be coming back to see him. Jim , worried that he won't be able to satisfy her needs, goes back to his one (at band camp) Michelle. With a little bit of training and helpful ""hands on"" learning, Michelle shows Jim the ropes and shows him where he made his mistakes on their one night of passion a year ago.
Seriously, American Pie 2 is one of the best sequels to a comedy I've ever seen. Again a lot of sexual humor and physical comediy, not as many poop and fart jokes as before and a lot more getting to know the rest of the guys instead of it being just Jim.
Now of course, you have to see American Pie first otherwise you totally throw off the movie and there will be a lot that either won't be funny to you or you just won't get it. So remember, before you watch American Pie 2, make sure you watch American Pie.

""American Pie"" was a hilarious, but still semi-truthful, look at teen sexuality.  It was clever, well written, and accomplished the rare feat of not treating it's audience like dullards.  ""American Pie 2,"" on the other hand, is just basically warmed-over gags seemingly left out of it's predeccessor's script.  Yes, many of these gags are hilarious and fun to watch, but gone is the original's creative writing and plot.  This film just seems to be the writer saying, ""Hey, let's do the exact same thing, but this time at the beach!""  As far as the cast goes, most of the actors do an honorable job staying true to their original characters, with the glaring exception of Chris Klein, who exudes this cheesy ""sensitive"" act of a pretty-boy with zero acting chops.  However, Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, and Eddie Kaye Thomas, most notably, have the potential to become great comic actors.  Also, Eugene Levy (the best part of the first film), is just as hilarious.  Basically, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one, but I can guarantee after the hype for the sequel dies down, it will be forgotton long before the original.",1031529600,,1253,4.732718894009216

Her role is expanded in this sequel, and Hannigan walks off with the whole movie under her arm. She's as sweet and goofy as Willow with way fewer inhibitions. She lustily helps Jason Biggs go after the exotic Shannon Elizabeth, all the while secretly pining for him herself.

1295871,3,B00003CY6C,"Remakes are rarely as good as the originals, and this movie is not exception... There are many, many scenes that just left me completely cold, and that I had to suffer through with considerable patience.  I liked the first film, but this one wasn't anywhere near up to the level of the first.
Many of the best scenes featured either or both Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy.  Like in the first film, Levy completely steals every scene in which he appears, as the father who is way, way too open-minded for the good of the relationship with his son.  Although this remake is not nearly as funny as the original, the scene in which Jason Biggs puts super glue to ill use is totally hysterical.
One of the reasons the sequel isn't as funny is the fact that the relationships between the various guys and their gals aren't developed as much as in the original.  The key element in these films is the irony between the intended sybaritism of the four (or five, if you count Stifler), and their basic monogamy.  But the impact of the monogamy comes from the tightness of the relationship with each guy's significant other, and apart from Biggs and Alyson Hannigan's characters, none of them are really developed in this one.
Overall, not a terrible film.  And fans of the original won't feel too terribly disappointed by the first.  In fact, if the more scatological and lascivious moments of the original were the parts that someone most enjoyed, one might like the sequel as much or more.

Sorry I can't tell you the plot.  I really wish I could, but there's one small problem.  There is none.  Usually that helps a movie.
All I could squeeze out of it is that things are changing for them after high school and Kevin feels that they need to stay together.  So he asks his older brother for advice and then rents a lake house for the summer and they have wild parties etc.etc.

1296005,4,B00003CY6C,"This is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years and one of the few sequels that r good. My favorite parts are when Stifler finds a blue dildo- yes, i said dildo,I also like Stifler's horny little brother trying to be a pimp. But the best scene has to be the superglue scene when Jim uses it as lubricant. The special features are just as good and they are:
1. The Making of American Pie 2- It's funny, but boring at times
2. Outtakes and deleted scenes- The outtakes are hillarious, especially when Jim has a swearing fit over Stifler's mom. The deleted scenes, however leave a lot to be desired.
3. Auditions from American Pie- In my opinion this should be on the first movie's dvd.
4. Behind the scenes- this is funny, sort of
5. Top 10 scenes of all time from American Pie 1 and 2- This is an awesome feature, but they should just show the whole scene instead of 15-20 seconds of it.
6. Best lines from the movie- This lets you select from a list of lines said in the movie and go right to that part of the movie.

1296006,2,B00003CY6C,"My mind has played a trick on me, not that that's a newsworthy event. Halfway through American Pie 2, I thought to myself how much better and funnier the original was. I just looked up my review, and I didn't much like it, for much the same reason I didn't care for the sequel. In both movies, the characters have such a clinical view of sex. The way I see it, if you have neither romance nor passion, the whole subject of sex is pretty tame, not to mention unimportant. Still, this second helping does bring back the original's main asset, which is a bright, talented and likable young cast. They are fun to watch and give the material their best shots. The reason it's not as good is simply that the jokes overall are not very inspired. Since this is a comedy, that's a big problem.
Jim [Jason Biggs] and his pals have just finished their first year of college. Now a summer, with its promise of booze, babes and parties, is ahead. One of Jim's friends decides the gang should rent a beach house on Lake Michigan, thus saving them from the horror of spending the summer with their parents. Nadia [Shannon Elizabeth], the exchange student Jim had some very embarrassing moments with live on the Net in the first movie, is traveling in Europe for the summer. She tells him she'll come to see him at the end of summer. Terrified that he will once again not perform up to her expectations, Jim seeks the help of Michelle [Alyson Hannigan], who is now a counselor at a nearby band camp. Michelle, as loony and out there as ever, agrees to 'train' him. Meanwhile, Stifler [Sean Scott Williams] remains a lovable macho idiot, Oz [Chris Klein] is still going with Jessica [Natasha Lyonne], Kevin [Thomas Ian Nichol] is now unhappily single, and Paul [Eddie Kaye Thomas] pines for Stifler's Mom.
While Universal Studios was able to reassemble the original cast, which was perhaps contractually obligated to do so, it could not get the writer and the director back. This may explain why the first one is more sophisticated, funnier and and less flawed than the sequel.
Jason Biggs is a good actor with a gift for physical comedy. Alyson Hannigan's character, Michelle, is forced to morph into a more normal girl. This change dilutes her part, but Hannigan is still often wickedly funny. Sean William Scott has a field day as Stifler, who has a much larger role this time. In an uncredited role, Jennifer Coolidge returns as Stifler's Mom. Coolidge is one of the best comedic actresses around, and it's too bad she is in just one scene. The cast really is good; in fact, it's more talent than the movie deserves. It gives it an illusion of quality.
There are a few scenes that work really well. I admit to laughing out loud during them. Others come off as awkward and underwritten. I found the movie to be rather provincial in its attitude towards sex, but I may simply be too jaded, since the movie was as big a hit overseas as it was here. On the other hand, the term 'provincial' is not one that applies solely to America.
The 'controversial' scene in the original involved Jim and a warm apple pie. This time around it is about Jim's close encounter with a tube of super glue. I mention this because, when you see the movie, I want you to answer this question: How on earth did Jim get his shoes back on?",1015718400,2,3299,4.518394648829432

if you liked the first one, you may like this.  i thought the first one was marginally funny.  i personally think i'm too intelligent for this movie.  the humor was soporific and generally appeals to the LCD in everyone.  it just so happens my LCD is way above most people Highest Common Denominator.

1296010,4,B00003CY6C,"Sequels like this one generally fall flat of the original.  Often the spark of what made #1 so good is lost and all you are left with is recycled punchlines.
This is not the case with AP2.  The laughs are genuine and original.  While American Pie had everything to do with the nerdy Jim, AP2 really centers it's energy around Stiffler.  Basically, there is a new star in the sequel.  A character like Stiffler works so well because he's that friend we all have that annoys us to no end - but you never want to be without him!
The only real downside to this movie is the absence of some original characters.  Oh, they're all there...but some are really in cameo form.  The female leads are almost non-factors.  They seem to be there just to pick up the paycheck.

This movie was just as good if not better than the first.  It keeps the same style humor as the first but thickens the plot on a more mature level.  The guys in the movie are now older and instead of just trying to get laid they try to rekindle the relationship they had the previous year before they all left for college.  Stifler once again brings his humor with but is given more of a part in this movie making it that much better.  Oz and Heather don't get as big of parts in this one but that can be a good thing.  I wasn't very impressed with their parts but they do add a more serious note to the movie.  Jim as usual finds himself in some of the most embarassing sexual blunders.  Kevin is still trying to bring back old times and of course Finch is on a quest to get Stiflers Mom back.

1296060,4,B00003CY6C,"(Slight spoiler of previous movie)
The surprise hit American Pie had some surprising comic substance that appealed to some who had expected the premise to imply an impalatable dose of ""raunchiness"". But the first movie did focus heavily on light comedy. Its most uncomfortable thing for me was the fact that the jock among the main characters was the one to apparently win true love in the course of the movie. In light of serious questions about adulation of jocks (in, for example, the wake of the Columbine School disaster) I thought any movie should give the issue some thought, not just casually invoking stock outcomes. The jock as winner syndrome therein, was it without conscious planning? Or was it supposed to be realism? If the latter, who really wants or needs realism in a thoroughly irreverent light comedy? But the sequel deos take different turns, possibly explaining why there might have been a hint of realism in the original - a possible explanantion, though I'm not saying a completely adequate resolution of my one main problem with the original. Anyhow, this sequel follows the continuing adventures of the main characters we met in the first film. Although comedy still abounds, there's some serious drama here, even some taking on of a more somber tone. As some of the characters mature, there's a bit of nostalgia about how their wildly adventurous high school days are over. Their outcomes are not always what the audience expected or necessarily hoped for. Some other characters may seem to mature little if at all. Those two contrasting situations may indeed be a dose of realism. And that as well as the jock as winner syndrome early on in the first movie may form part of an overall perspective of realism when we see the two movies collectively. Was that all planned in advance? I'm not sure how that generally works. Are sequels generally an afterthought or part of a complete story palnned from the start?",1014076800,,1938,4.858006042296073

It's all awkward situations and insane predicaments that only the most clumsy or insane would get involved in.  The whole cast returns as was probably written in their contracts for the first one.  The ""gross-out"" humor is in full-effect, but it isn't as flagrantly rancid as the first one.  But bodily fluids still play a prominent role.  It's funny and entertaining throughout, with a few memorable one-liners.  The plot isn't as strong as the first one, it plays out just as a summer filled with sex and mischief with no point which isn't really a problem I guess.

To me AP2 is even better than the first. American Pie contained more of the everyday sexual encounters that teenage comedies now have. When I saw the first movie I wasn't really up for it because I already knew what was going to happen (except for the bedroom part). But, For American Pie 2, I was really surprised that even though it still had sexual situations (which I thought was even funnier that the first) it also had heart.
It really made me realise that the characters have grown up and are taking things a bit more seriously. From their relationship with friends and family.

You really do need to see AP1 to fully appreciate the humor of AP2 as many of the jokes are continuations of jokes from AP1. The main plot concerns what happens when the boys finish their first year of college. They return home and start doing the same things they did before, including going to high school parties. But then they realize that things change, and they all grow and change in funny and believable ways (well, almost all of them grow up).
Unfortunately, two of the most likeable characters/actors from the first film (Chris Klein and Mena Suvari) have small parts and few laughs. Instead, Michelle (one time at band camp...) and Stifler are given larger roles and more laughs.
The DVD is packed with goodies. Casting tapes from AP1 of many of the stars are included and you can definitely see why they got the parts. Outakes and deleted scenes are also included and add much humor. In addition, the 10 funniest scenes (as voted by internet audiences) from AP1 and AP2 are counted down.

This time the role of Stiffler is expanded and Shannon Elizabeth (who's accent is hard to watch, anyway) and Tara Reid's characters are pushed into the background, making your wonder why they were asked back in the first place.  This one has a little more heart and more outrageous gags (blue dildos, phone sex,lesbianism...superglue?) and what rocks about this movie is that the girls take control and exploit the guys libidos for a few laughs.

1296190,5,B00003CY6C,"The first American Pie started the trend, but American Pie 2 has even more laughs.  And it has retained and amplified one important aspect of the original, a somewhat cornball sentimentality that offers a nice counterbalance to the gross sight gags and pervasive atmosphere of salaciousness.
Jason Biggs continues to throw himself into the most embarrassing of situations with admirable gusto, and the movie hinges on his ability to play Jim's most humiliating shenanigans with an odd but appealing, dogged dignity...even when wearing only his drawers.  His comic timing is even better than last time, and the movie's best moments come of his straight-faced delivery.  And in this sequel you can see how Alyson Hannigan managed to walk off with the most famous line in the original:  Given much more weight in American Pie 2, Hannigan is a delight, playing Michelle's offbeat geekiness but hidden warmth to perfection.  And her deadpan delivery (the ""trumpet"" line is bound to become another classic) is beautiful as always.  Shannon Elizabeth is surprisingly lacklustre, and Tara Reid is still stuck with the most boring character of the bunch, but otherwise the rest of the supporting cast (Seann William Scott is especially good, reprising uber-jock Stifler) is great, and the sight and verbal gags come faster and tighter than in the original, with the benefit of familiar characters.  The famous central gag (won't give it away) had me belly-laughing for a solid minute, something I haven't done since the first time I saw Clerks.
No, it's not cerebral, nor is it an unprecedented classic.  But for a good rowdy night of teen comedy, American Pie 2 hits the spot.",1012003200,10,1668,5.062043795620438
1296191,4,B00003CY6C,"As sequels go, this isn't too bad.  Most sequels underperform the original by a good margin, but this one falls off only slightly.  In many places the comedy in APII is better than the first.  However, it is mostly just raunchier.  What is missing here is any attempt at creating a plot.  The first film had a clear and consistent plot that revolved around ""The Pact"".  It also had a candor about it that was very representative of high school life with all its braggadocio, bravado and hidden insecurities.  With the exception of Jim (Jason Biggs) who retains his performance anxiety from the last film, all the innocence is gone from this film and with it much of the charm.  Most of the cast members are back, but the cohesiveness is missing along with some of the synergy.
That doesn't mean it is without laughs because outrageous sex skits will always be funny (as long as they don't get too gross, like Scary Movie) and this film has them in abundance.  Some miss but most hit.  You could see the super glue bit coming a mile away, but it is still hilarious.  The phone sex scene isn't.  Still, the best scenes in the film are not the raunchy ones, but the sex lessons given to Jim by his friendly band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).
Jason Biggs leads the ensemble with another terrific performance of a guy obsessed with performance.  Biggs is the actor with the most nuance in the cast, capable of both outrageous and subtle humor.  Shannon Elizabeth is sidelined as the Nadia, being more of an object than an active participant in this film.  Chris Klein is also marginalized with very few scenes worth mentioning.  Seann William Scott is back as Stifler, more outrageous than ever.  This time he goes too far making the character's crudeness and untamed libido so obnoxious that it stops being funny.  Eddie Kaye Thomas isn't given much to work with the way Finch is written this time, being more bizarre than comical.  Once again, Alyson Hannigan steals the show as Michelle, the queen of band camp.  Her wide eyed facial expressions are priceless and her comic timing is impeccable.  Hannigan and Biggs have fantastic chemistry and play off one another so well that they could have been a vaudeville act.  Eugene Levy is marvelous as Jim's well meaning but hopelessly square dad.
This film meanders a great deal and misses the freshness of the first film, but is still packed with plenty of fun.  I rated it a 7/10.  For those not offended by crass language and sexually explicit humor, it will probably be a great time.",1012003200,3,2534,4.655405405405405

1296193,3,B00003CY6C,"While it was nice to see ""the gang"" back together again reprising their roles, it appeared immediately that American Pie 2 was a rehash of the first in lesser grade. Back home for summer from their first year as college students, the gang is out for more ways to get some action - obviously college taught them nothing. Each member is still attached to the previous episode of high school charm and humor. So much so, that they keep bringing up past events as if they would be funny again. I remember thinking as I was watching the film, those were funny moments, but why are they not funny here? I realized they were not funny because they were memories. As the moral of the story later sets in, that one cannot live in the past and cling to memories, so should have the writers considered this when writing the script. I would like to further note that I got the distinct impression that all of the actors held a sense of self-consciousness in thier acting. Most notably Michelle, the band camp girl. It was as if Michelle and the rest of the crew were going through some sort of thespian puberty; highly aware of their popularity and the comradery that they are supposed to have with each other. This did not ring through for me like the first one did. I sensed in the first one they were all true friends, as if they grew up with each other. While in this film, they were getting the job done to get paid and go home. My expectations to laugh uncontrolably may have set my ability to be highly critical of the film, and I really wanted to laugh, however, I felt that all of the humor missed the mark by a few inches. The situational humor versus the ""memorial"" humor is obviously the key to its success, as the first American Pie demonstrated each moment to be as funny as the next.

I did love the expansion of Alyson Hannigan's part and Jim's realization that they are more similar than he originally thought. That is what made the DVD worth a purchase rather than a rental.
Mena Suvari only makes a few brief appearances which is a shame. Tara Reid only makes a few brief appearances
which is a blessing. Tara Reid sucks the life out of any scene that she is in. Case in point, her ex and her agree to be friends and he leans in to kiss her - instead of merely doing a ""hey, wait, what gives"" reaction she acts like a beaten puppy as she whimpers, ""Whoa, friends, ...right?"" 1/2 the fault of bad acting - 1/2 the fault of weak directing.
I did discover that it was better on second and third viewing because I could enjoy it more on it's own merit and it was allowed to step out of the shadow of AP1.
So in short the cast was pretty solid with the exception of Reid (but she was a small part.) Special attention goes out to Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, and the Jennifer Coolidge's (Stifler's mom) cameo. The directing was rather weak and the story could use tightening. Still, there were several funny moments and a few that were really laugh out loud funny so I do recommend this DVD overall.",1011571200,,1386,4.233962264150944
1296196,5,B00003CY6C,"Quite honestly, after seeing the ""unrated"" version of the first movie (the pie scene's a /bit/ different, for those that don't know, among a few other things), I honestly don't see a whole lot different about this one over the original movie (though I honestly haven't compared them side-by-side); perhaps a slight bit more nudity, but... *shrug*
In any case, this is a GREAT movie that can easily stand on its own without the first (though it does nicely continue the series with all your favorite characters).",1011484800,,511,4.885057471264368
1296197,4,B00003CY6C,"I definitely thought this second movie was funnier than the first with their little catch phrases and over the top sexual humor. I liked how they were pushing the Stifler character to the limits of homophobia all in the name of seeing some lesbian action. The things some guys will do, huh? :) Anyways, it's a nice little teen movie that again is reminiscent with the old 80's teen sex movies updated to the 21st century. While I know the story centers around the four main guys, it was kinda disappointing not to see more screen time from Mena and the rest of the girls. But, Alysson Hannigan definitely got more character time and was a welcome sight. I always thought she has a nice range of skills in the dramatic and comedic roles.
Anyways, as for the rest of the dvd, we get a  full complement of extras from the standard bios, alternate languages, subtitles to the special ""Making of..,"" deleted scenes, outtakes, collection of catch phrases and favorite scenes, and one music video. I found the one included music video kinda disappointing cause AP 2 had some great soundtrack and would have liked to have seen the videos from the other artists as well. They also have four separate commentary tracks from the director, the writer, Jason/Mena/???, and Eddie Kaye Thomas so if you have some spare time you can review the movie with their impressions. Definitely, a nice good humurous movie that'll make you relieve some of the funny parts of your own adolesence.",1011484800,,1469,4.715953307392996
1296257,3,B00003CY6C,"The big summer sensation a couple of years back was 'American Pie', so before you know it a sequel was released.  Here we have Jim (Jason Biggs) again struggling to get the girls and along with friends Chris Klein, Sean William Scott and Alyson Hannigan prepares himself for another meeting with European beauty Nadia.  So off they go to a beach house for some fun.
What's good about this movie is that the whole cast of the first movie are all here and the cast is actually very good, especially considering it's a teen movie.  Biggs is great as the goofy Jim, Eugene Levy is one of the highlights of the movie as Jim's understanding father and Alyson Hannigan has a bigger role that she plays to great effect.  This all helps to make the audience care for the flawed characters on the screen, and isn't it nice to see flawed characters for a change?
Unfortunately though, the humour is purely of the gross-out kind, making you cry out in disgust or nervously laugh at the various embarrassing situations.  This all means that it's really just a sweet but effective movie that never quite hits the comic highs of the first.  It's certainly not unenjoyable though, is never overly nice and its frank display of adolesence is refreshing.",1011484800,,1236,4.646788990825688

At times you might find yourself thinking 'okay..this is too much..'but  the film quickly redeems itself when it finds it's heart again and regains some balance .

1296263,5,B00003CY6C,American Pie 2 is just another fact that sometimes sequels are better than their predecessors. I laughed so hard I nearly had an accident Seann W. Scott who plays Stiffler is without a doubt the funniest person in the whole film. My favorite scene is when Stiffler is playing football with a bunch of girls and while he's staring at Finch gets hit in the nuts. I recommend this hilarious film to anyone that needs a good laugh.,1011052800,,427,4.487179487179487
1296264,5,B00003CY6C,"AP2 is better and funnier than the first bar none. Although there is less of a story behind it. It is packed with so much crudeness which keeps you holding your stomach asking what could possibly happen next. There is more involvement with females this time (other than the original). The original females don't play as big a role in this one, which is fine because they dominated the first one. This movie is a guarantee 5 star and a must buy....can't wait for AP3!!!",1010966400,,468,4.517647058823529

If you go into the film knowing that you won't be as shocked as you were for AP1, then you will love it.  Since AP1 set the new teen comedy standard this type of humor has been run through the mill, but with the entire cast back and a great story line and a feeling of intimacy with the characters, this movie is hilarious and emotionally gratifying.  Watch it and expect to laugh a lot.  Great comedy.",1009929600,,576,4.053097345132743
1296324,5,B00003CY6C,"I went to this movie after seeing American Pie because I am totally obsessed with anything that has to do with Seann William Scott, or as many people know him as, Steve Stifler. American Pie 2 may have less of the element of surprise, considering Jason Biggs played with the pie in the first one, but AP2 still has lots of laughs. There is, for instance, the scene with Stifler, Finch and Jim meeting the two so-called lesbians, the scene where Jim glues his hand to his unmentionables, as well as others. It kept me entertained and smiling. I went in for Seann William Scott and came out, not only with satisfaction after watching him on the big screen again, but with much more as well. Jason Biggs, Seann and Alyson Hannigan are the stand-outs in this film and they kept me laughing the whole way through. This movie wasn't made for young children (HELLO?! it's R, it should clue people in that it's not for children) and it wasn't made so it could win an Oscar or Academy Award or anything. It was just a movie made to entertain people so you can go out and watch an adolescent teen comedy. If you like a good comedy, check American Pie 2 out.",1009929600,,1147,4.389671361502347
1296325,4,B00003CY6C,"""American Pie 2"" is a very hard film to review. Why? Because, on a purely filmmaking level, it is not as good a movie as the first. It has a weaker (almost non-existent) story, almost completely ignores all of the female characters from the first film, and has very little purpose other than to entertain. On the other hand, somehow it manages to be exponentially more fun than the first film, which, although I loved it, was weighed down by its moral that sex is not as good as its cracked up to be, unless it's with someone you love. It is more fun than the first film, more hilariously, gutbustingly funny, and is also one of the few sequels that (1) should not be missed and (2) is a logical extension of the first film. What do I mean by that? This sequel wisely picks up jokes and story threads from the first movie, and reworks and twists them in ways that make them even funnier. One would never guess watching the first film how some throwaway lines and jokes pay off in this second film. More than most sequels, this is a truly a companion movie to the first.
Another great idea is how the small, yet extremely popular character of Michelle (the band-camp girl) from the first movie, is expanded into a much fuller, more poignant character in this, the second film.
I will guarantee you that, if you have an open mind for humor, and enjoyed the first film, you will have a great time with this movie. Finally a comedy sequel that is equal or better than its predecessor!",1009411200,18,1480,4.405109489051095
1296326,4,B00003CY6C,"American Pie was a classic and remains one of the funniest movies of the past few years. American Pie 2 is a step down from the original but it is still very funny. All the original cast members are back and it still has the same gross out jokes. They do get a bit old, alot of the jokes are the same jokes we laughed at in the first one. However the cast is so charming that you can't help but laugh at them. Alyson Haningan is by far the best of the bunch, and she gets twice as much screen time in the sequel. I do have to say THANK THE LORD that Tara Reid is not in it as much. She is by far the most annoying of the bunch and has a little to do. Overall I laughed out loud quite a few times and would definetly recommend it.",1008979200,,729,3.8026315789473686

Two weeks ago, I knew that in this website I could pre-order this movie. It was amazing to know that. I think there will be two versions of the movie: the first released will be the unrated version which will contains footage material cut from the theatrical exhibition; and the second one the version who could see in theaters. My decision is declined for the unrated version. I will buy this for two reasons: I got ""American Pie: Unrated Version"" and I want to see which escenes was censored by the MPAA.
I live in Spain and I don't think the international version of the Universal movie was censored too, because there are a lot of sexual scenes. But some case, I will buy this R version and I compared the theatrical and the DVD .
I know in USA the film was censored but I think that cut scenes
wasn't any trouble to see.
I expect on January 15, 2002, the release of the ""American Pie 2: Unrated Version"" on DVD in candles.

1296331,2,B00003CY6C,"If you liked American Pie (the original) because it was a somewhat unique comedy, this film will disappoint you.
I expected very little when I saw the first film, and came away surprised. It actually had a storyline and wasn't just a string of crude jokes thrown together in a random sequence (what I was expecting). I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs - the one that opened the movie literally brought tears to my eyes (of laughter, not joy).
American Pie 2? Well, the crude jokes are there, but unlike the original, you can seeing them coming well in advance which takes some of the zing out of them.
Case in point: During a party scene, one guy urinates off the balcony onto Stiffler's head. I'm sorry, but the set-up on this gag took so long that if you didn't see it coming 5 minutes in advance, you may be a good candidate for junior college.
And unfortunately, most of the other scenes were equally predictable. I started thinking I might be clairvoyant halfway through the the movie I got so good at ""predicting"" what was going to occur next.
Some jokes in the second film ARE truly funny (I did like the scenes from band camp), but the lack of a storyline makes the act of sitting through it a truly unpleasant experience for anyone who isn't under 16 and male.
I used to rate movies by the number of times I looked at my watch during the film. I.e., if I sit there for two hours and never once look at my watch, it's a great film.
I looked at my watch five times during the 1.5 hours of American Pie 2 - something I haven't done since The Man Who Knew Too Little was in theatres. I want my 90 minutes back.",1006905600,5,1647,4.316129032258065

I like high school and college comedies and I can see the good in American Pie 2 (and the first film), like the quality characters, genuinely amusing parts, the fun rockin soundtrack and the beauty of some of the girls, like Mena Suvari & Lisa Arturo, but theres just too much raunch. The over-the-top sleazy/vulgar parts ruin the good, for me anyway. Its a shame; what a waste.
