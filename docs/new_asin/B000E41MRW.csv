8105757,4,B000E41MRW,"Bill Plympton's animation style never ceases to amaze me, although I really didn't care too much for his amateurish student films.",1375056000,,130,5.238095238095238
8105758,5,B000E41MRW,"I've loved Bill Plympton's work for years. Was completely estatic to find a collection of his work!

The seller almost didn't give the collection enough credit :)

A on quality, speed and packaging. A great find! :)",1355616000,,215,4.783783783783784
8105759,2,B000E41MRW,"""Your Face"" from 1987 is three minutes of inspired jittery scribbly animated brilliance: it's strange, funny, even somehow grotesquely lovely. But the rest of this stuff? His previous efforts range from mildly amusing to embarrassingly amateurish. After ""Your Face,"" Plympton increasingly coasts along on endless variations of the same two or three ideas. And in the meantime, unfortunately, he animated one of the worst music videos I've ever seen: Peter Himmelman's ""245 Days."" Plus, the ""bonus feature"" documentary profiles of Plympton are unwatchably bland and boring. Should have combined the best of this material with Plympton's feature-length film The Tune to create a much more appealing Plymptoons DVD.",1153094400,3,712,5.601851851851852

Self Portrait / The Turn On / Lucas, The Ear of Corn / Boomtown / Drawing Lesson #2 / Your Face / Love in the Fast Lane / One of those Days / How to Kiss / 25 Ways to Quit Smoking / 245 Days / Noodle Ear / Human Rights / Environmental / Trivial Pursuit #1 / Trivial Pursuit #2 / Sugar Delight #1 / Sugar Delight #2 / Previous Lives #1 / Previous Lives #2 / Plymptoons.

Sounds familiar? Yes! you are right! exactly the same content as in Sling Shot's ""Plymptoons - The Complete Works of Bill Plympton (1991)"".

Is there something really different there? Oh! I guess you can consider the new title of the DVD an the new cover design (courtesy of New Video). ""Plus"" two Exclusive Bill Plympton Documentaries; Sketch Gallery; Animator Biography; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection.

If you already own Sling Shot's version of Plymptoon works  be warned. But if this is the first time you hear of this title... it could be a ""new"" opportunity to (re)discover Bill Plympton.

I hope distribuitors find more resources to make a DVD reedition worth.",1139270400,18,1062,4.505208333333333
