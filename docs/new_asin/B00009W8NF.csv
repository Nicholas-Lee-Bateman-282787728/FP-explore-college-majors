1892774,5,B00009W8NF,This is one of the funniest stand up routines I have every seen. This is a worthy addition to any video collection and will become a classic.,1076457600,5,141,4.2592592592592595
1892775,5,B00009W8NF,"This is one of the best Stand ups ever i could not stop laughing at it.  I watch it again and again, evertime someone comes over i make sure they have seen it.  If you like stand up at all this is one to add to your colection.  I just can't wait until he does another one.",1076198400,4,272,3.736842105263158
1892776,5,B00009W8NF,"Kevin James is very TALENTED! He is such a natural on stage.
It's nice to know that you can buy a stand up routine in this day
and age and enjoy it with mixed company and not blush with embarressment because of cursing and x-rated content. The matierial is hysterical, I had tears coming down my face. I
am a big fan of the sitcom King Of Queens, alot of the skits
are very reminicent of some of the routines they do on the show.
A great purchase if your looking for intelligent clean comedy.",1073001600,26,492,4.189473684210526
1892777,5,B00009W8NF,"How big are muffins going to get before we join hands across America?!?!?
Kevin James - Sweat the Small Stuff has to be the funniest stand-up that I have seen in all my years, and it's not just funny when you watch it either!  When you get excited about having exact change at the drive through, or when you see your food coming at a restaurant you'll know why!  You just can't go wrong with this DVD, you will watch it over and over and over again and still laugh till you drop.  Then you'll go to the airport and laugh even more when you see some of the things in real life!  I Highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to laugh, you don't have to be a Kevin James fan to enjoy his stand up comedy.  You'll end up buying this for your friends, family (97% family friendly), and neighbors and they will love you for it!
The bonus material has some appearances of Mr. James on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, which are pretty fun too.  Kevin is like the fun brother inlaw that gives you a reason to attend those dreaded family functions.
Kevin James rated number 89 on Comedy Centrals 100 funniest stand up comedians, IMHO he's WAY funnier than that, he should have ranked in the low teens!
When I'm mad and someone asks for a phone number, I use BAD phone number rhythm, just to annoy them and it makes me feel better.  Thanks Kevin!",1072742400,25,1339,4.248031496062992
1892778,5,B00009W8NF,"Absolutely hilarious -- Kevin James is a master of comedy on stage. I've seen some of his sitcoms (King of Queens) and didn't find them too funny; actually they were a disappointment for me because I was comparing them to his standup which I saw first. All in all, this is a worthy purchase because you will want to watch it again and again; then you'll have to show it to your friends.",1072483200,3,386,4.301369863013699
1892779,5,B00009W8NF,"We have watched Kevin James repeatedly and still laugh EVERY time! Everyone can relate to his humor, our teenager thinks Kevin James is the ""funniest man on earth""! We even laugh when we are in situations that he discusses in his routine; airports, banks, jet-skiing, deli food, fast-food drive throughs. Everyday stuff that we might find mundane, Kevin James makes hilarious. You cannot watch this without wanting to share it with others! No crude language or mature content, great for the whole family. This is funnier than any stand-up routine you have ever enjoyed!",1072224000,5,569,5.0638297872340425
1892780,5,B00009W8NF,"Kevin James doesn't get on the mic too often, but when he does it was definitly worth the wait. In probably the best Comedy Central full length special to date watch Kevin James attack the DMV, airports, male ego, and a females obsession with greeting cards. 5 stars, and two thumbs way up for Sweat The Small Stuff!",1057190400,15,316,4.4655172413793105

1892815,5,B00009W8NF,"Very funny especially the sound effects he does (bear noises, jet ski and choking on popcorn). I liked that it had very little bad language also. Have seen in four times and laughed hard all four times",1409788800,,201,4.45945945945946

1892818,1,B00009W8NF,I purchased this item thru amazon prime and 7 days later I check the tracking status AGAIN and it says scheduled to ship sometime between Feb 8 and Feb 25. Are you kidding me?! Oh hey it's a dvd but we'll get to it when we feel like it! I would've gladly paid extra for shipping if I had known this seller was going to take their time getting it shipped. I'm so disappointed that this is even an OPTION that I wanted to make sure everyone knows that this seller clearly doesn't know much about what they're doing so I would DEFINITELY not use them again. Goodwill Industries of Denver is who I purchased thru. I've seen this stand up before Kevin James is hilarious just be sure to order it from the right person!!!!!!,1391731200,,718,4.286764705882353
1892819,5,B00009W8NF,"This show is so hard to get in DVD format ... in ANY format so if you can find it, grab it!  Kevin James is hilarious and has a clean show.",1379548800,,139,3.4838709677419355
1892820,4,B00009W8NF,"I took my wife to the 2nd Kevin James show at the Tulsa Convention Center on Sunday Sept. 8, 2013. Very funny! On the bad side $115.oo tickets and he was on stage maybe an hour. Show was supposed to start at 7:30 got started about 7:45 and warm up act and Kevin were done by 9:00. Kind of Dissappointing for that kind of money.

1892832,5,B00009W8NF,This is my favorite stand up dvd I own. I've watched it over and over for 10 years now and I absolutely love it. It brings me to tears with laughter. Kevin James is just amazing!,1366588800,,178,3.9722222222222223
1892833,4,B00009W8NF,Kevin James is hilarious! He cracks me up to the point of actual tears. The only thing that holds me back from 5 stars is how they didn't just play the show straight through. It showed where the commercials would be. If you like Kevin James on TV you will really enjoy this comedy special.,1361664000,,289,4.2727272727272725

1892835,5,B00009W8NF,"I love this DVD. I saw it a long time ago when it aired on Comedy Central, but it's been impossible to find elsewhere. Netflix doesn't even offer it (yet...). I was glad to find a real copy of it, and of course I love it! It's great because a lot of comedians rely on dirty jokes and vulgarity to be funny, but this entire DVD is clean and family friendly. Hilarious!",1357603200,,367,4.111111111111111
1892836,2,B00009W8NF,"Kevin James is the best.  This video was a disappointment.  I didn't even finish watching it.  I guess i was expecting too much...wasn't the King of Queens, that's for sure.",1357603200,,173,4.7
1892837,4,B00009W8NF,"This DVD is funny but leaves you asking ""Is this it?""  Seems like a very short CD for the money.",1356912000,,96,3.8
1892838,3,B00009W8NF,"I got this in good time. However, not sure how the DVD plays as it is a Christmas gift for my husband. He is a HUGE Kevin James fan and I hate that Comedy Central did not release but a few copies.",1354838400,,196,3.6904761904761907
1892839,5,B00009W8NF,"I saw this on tv a few years back and had always wanted to see it again. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be that many copies out there; and the ones that I could find were not exactly cheap. I finally found one for about $30 and invited some friends over and we all LOVED IT! Kevin James knows how to hit an audience with material that we can all relate too. He takes those little things that we call stress and turns it into a hilarious experience!! Now, every time one of these ""little things"" happens I can't help but laugh! All I can think of are his jokes.
On the downside, it is much shorter than most..
I still highly recommend this for Kevin James lovers.",1318204800,,666,4.2109375
1892840,5,B00009W8NF,We saw this on Comedy Central a couple years ago and have been looking for it on DVD ever since.  So glad to get this and laugh (and laugh and laugh) again!,1317513600,,156,3.875
1892851,1,B00009W8NF,"I was so happy to have found Kevin James ""Sweatn' the small stuff"" on DVD for a reasonable price.  But come to find out this copy had been fabricated.  The disk was a DVD-R and the cover was made by computer.  Not impressed paying $50 for a burnt copy.  They could at least admit that it was not issued be Comedy Central, I think there's a copyright issue here.......",1314576000,4,367,4.27536231884058
1892852,5,B00009W8NF,"Kevin James is a wonderful comic in the vein of Bill Cosby or Sinbad. Artists who can set up a scene, make you laugh till you're blue in the face, and never utter a curse. My only complaint is that he doesn't have more stand up films. The dvd arrived before the scheduled time, and the quality was terrific!",1302480000,,307,4.220338983050848

1892855,5,B00009W8NF,"Kevin James is the best! On the DVD case it should say, ""Caution, you will laugh your head off!"" If your looking for some good clean comedy, that you can actually laugh at, this is the DVD for you. No need to feel uncomfortable when watching with the family wheather they be young or old. Kevin James knows how to put o smile on your face, even when your feeling down. And whats best about it is that it never gets old. Sure the price is alittle crazy but it is a must see. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good time. Like they say, ""Laughter is the best medicine."" And Kevin James, he gets it!",1290384000,,616,4.099173553719008
1892856,5,B00009W8NF,This video is the funniest routine I have seen in years! I could totally relate to what he was saying. I guess that is what made it so funny to me. I have had a blast watching it with family and friends. I would highly recommend for older kids and adults. There was a little language in it.,1290124800,,290,4.017241379310345
1892857,5,B00009W8NF,Kevin James: I love him.  This is a DVD to watch with your parents & not feel embarrassed.  He puts out true life comedy that everyone can relate to in a way that is belly laugh funny while keeping it clean for all ages.,1283126400,,220,3.977272727272727

1892859,5,B00009W8NF,Kevin James is so funny....I loved The King of Queens....his stand up comedy is just as funny if not more at times....This DVD is great for the comedy collection....,1272153600,,165,4.724137931034483

1892861,5,B00009W8NF,"Kevin James is so funny in this video! He puts the awkward moments in life that everyone has been through and makes you laugh about them! :) I loved this DVD and watch it over and over when I need a laugh, or if I don't! Good job Kevin James! It's a little over-priced, only because there aren't many available but I think it's worth if you like Kevin James.",1262304000,,358,4.128571428571429
1892862,5,B00009W8NF,"Great video Kevin James is very funny. Best Comedian I've seen in a long time. There is little or no swearing so it's good for the whole family, hard to find that quality these day's.",1261353600,,183,4.257142857142857

1892864,3,B00009W8NF,"Ok While Kevin James is a fat funny man, to pay 80 dollars for an hour or so dvd that i've seen on comedy central on the daily is absolutely ridiculous. You are basically paying more than a dollar per minute. Even a movie Dvd costs no more than [...] bucks. Who pays this much to watch stand up, He is not even Katt Williams and Katt is way cheaper.",1245110400,,349,4.0
1892865,5,B00009W8NF,"OMG, this is the funniest stand up I have ever seen.  I mean, I always loved Kevin James on King of Queens and thought he was really funny, but this show was hysterical.  It came on one night when I couldn't sleep and my husband was asleep next to me.  I ended up laughing so hard and out loud that I woke himn several times.  There I was, watching it by myself and I could not contain myself. I actually had tears rolling down my face.  This. guy is unbelievable!  My favorite is when he takes the jokes a step further, meaning he will do a joke, then make a face to go with it and everyone will laugh, but then he takes it a step further and just stays there like that for a longer period of time.  IT is so funny.  My life hasn't been very happy lately and I cannot remember when I ever laughed that hard.  I really needed a good laugh!  Thanks, Kevin!  Everyone should see this stand up show!

1892866,1,B00009W8NF,"I've owned this stand-up routine on VHS for several years now, since shortly after it first aired on Comedy Central. What I'm having a hard time understanding is why this is so incredibly expensive! It's absolutely ridiculous. There are plenty of other stand-up comedy DVDs on this site that haven't really been in circulation for some time, and yet you can still get them for under twenty bucks. What's the big deal about this one?

Come on, TPTB @ Amazon. Use your brains and realize we're not going to spend a hundred bucks for 45-minutes of stand-up.",1243814400,4,554,4.711340206185567

Barely any words are spoken, and it was all hilarious. The act does fall flat at times, the water-skiing part was not the best. But, the cheap underwear, greeting cards and little things to bring up after a date: they were all hilarious.",1220659200,,381,4.305555555555555

Very funny stuff!",1216857600,,318,4.283333333333333
1892881,5,B00009W8NF,Kevin James is the funniest guy I have ever had the pleasure to listen to.  Just one thing that confuses me is why is this DVD so exspensive.  His stand-up is like an hour long and it costs about $70 to see it.  Many other popular comedians have DVD stand-ups that run about $15-$20 with the same amount of playing time.  I just don't understand.,1200096000,,346,4.276923076923077

Much of his routine is like what he did in Kings of Queens, but he takes it a step further. He really gets into any situation and makes it asburd, yet still credible.

One of funniest bits is on phone number giving rhythym and etiquette, followed by his jet ski routine.

If you enjoy stand-up, or even if you don't, buy this video. You'll watch and rewatch it over and over.",1149984000,3,537,4.35

1892888,4,B00009W8NF,"You can definitely see that Kevin James is the star in a hit sitcom because the things he acts out he acts out well. If you know King of Queens this show won't really come as a surprise: many of the situations could be episodes.

The bits are not highly original. He is definitely not the first to make jokes about standing in line in the bank or at the airport. Some jokes are almost exactly the same as George Carlin once made for example.

The biggest difference between someone like Carlin and James is that James is very clean. No swear words at all.

Of course many of the bits are about food. The part about eating a big mac is hilarious, especially how he acts it out.

It's worth seeing, especially if you like Doug Heffernan.",1132012800,5,735,4.304347826086956

Makes observations that are simple and not funny.
Makes like one or two facial expressions.
Has one talking voice, and one yelling voice, no variation...

It was sad to see the people in the audience laughing so hard about NOTHING FUNNY. Oh man, waste of my time. Please, don't waste yours. (Or your money. This Dvd is surprisingly expensive...)

What he has to offer is his oversized energy and enthusiasm.
