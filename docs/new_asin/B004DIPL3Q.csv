4332546,5,B004DIPL3Q,"The music has been covered by reviewers better versed in critiqueing Wagner than me, I am a casual classical listener and love showpieces. This is a reference quality bluray audio and video recording, more amazing that it was recorded 12 years ago. This disk has given me a greater appreciation of Wagner, Maazel the BP orchestra and this piece than ANY other classical music I have purchased for one big reason, I can see which instrument(s) are playing to make the music I am hearing. Highly recommended. This is the best $9 I have EVER spent on clasical music.",1350518400,6,563,4.696969696969697
4332547,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Even if you know nothing about The Ring, or more, you think Wagner is too difficult for you, this Blu-ray will definitely change your mind.  I watched and listened to the music assuming I know nothing about The Ring. The drama is in the music itself. If you don't know the plot (a summary is given in the pamphlet accompanying the disc) you will be imagining things that may be happening. It may be a totally different story than the one Wagner created, but it will captivate you during the 80 minutes this compilation lasts. You will probably recognize some of the music as it has been used in movies, commercials, etc.
For those that know the plots and the music, you will go through the whole cycle in 80 minutes. It does not replace the complete cycle with voices, productions and everything that an opera encompass, but it does a very good job at letting us enjoy the music and the drama it represents.
The Blu-ray surround sound is just perfect, in particular for those like me who listen to it in full volume.  The camera work adds to the enjoyment of the music. Looking at the players while listening to the music makes you feel you are really there.
I strongly recommend this Blu-ray to those who already know The Ring and in particular to those who don't know it or are hesitant to try Wagner.",1349222400,20,1303,4.470588235294118
4332548,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Lorin Maazel considered requests to create a synthesis of Wagner's Ring cycle as a continuous `Ring without Words' twice before finally agreeing to the request made by the recording company, Telarc, in 1987. The resultant 75 minute recording proved to be a big seller and in Maazel's opinion it helped to create a new audience for the operas.

In creating this continuous synthesis Maazel attempted to produce a reduced version which followed strict chronological order and which introduced all the main themes and motifs without adding a single note not written by Wagner. In this he reinforced Wieland Wagner's view (Wagner's Grandson) that the essence of the work lies in the orchestral score.

Weiland Wagner's view is worth considering in this context and can be quoted as stated to Maazel at a rehearsal of the Ring as `The orchestra, that's where it all is - the text behind the text, the universal subconscious that binds Wagner's personae one to another and to the proto-ego of legend ....'

As one who has known The Ring cycle for around 40 years or so this synthesis is both impressive and intriguing. It is also successful in terms of what was attempted as in paragraphs 1-2 above. It is impressive because it covers so many of the key moments and intriguing because it jumps unexpectedly from one key point to another without including what you would expect to hear next! It becomes a sort of quiz - spot the excerpt, and a rather enjoyable one too!

The whole experience is enormously enhanced by the wonderful playing of the Berlin Philharmonic at full strength. Four harps is an impressive sight not to mention vast ranks of strings and incisively burnished brass. If ever an orchestra was born to play this music it has to be this one. The visual impact provides a real advantage over audio only reproduction.

In terms of reproduction, this early example of high definition recording from 2000 is a complete success with crisp imaging of considerable clarity and fully involving camera work. The sound is wide ranging and presented in DTS-HD 5.1 as well as stereo. There is a short bonus in which Maazel says much of what is relayed above and which is even more fully covered in the sleeve notes.

As a keen Wagner Ring enthusiast, I still found this a very enjoyable experience for all the reasons above. I would expect it to give much pleasure to all but the most hardened of purists and, in addition, it might be a very useful way of getting to know the basics of the opera cycle as an introduction in miniature so to speak. For all the above reasons therefore, and in my own personal opinion, it seems only reasonable to rate this as a 5 star issue.

In conclusion, I would suggest that this fine disc should, at the very least, warrant serious consideration from purchasers interested in this popular program.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

A wonderful review. I was at first thinking of the Ring exposition I heard in college, which was definitely with words and accompanied by the London Philharmonic. That was in the 1960s and long before digital recordings. I look forward to this recording all the more. (see below)

You have raised some very relevant issues concerning the utility and the mechanics of reviews by Amazon clients. I thoroughly agree with your thoughtful criteria, and I am angry beyond measure by the cynical lack of responsibility in the away Amazon manages this potentially invaluable resource ............  Opinions are useless unless they are the product of educated minds, and a star-scoring system is fraudulent unless all those who apply it have agreed to detailed criteria for each level. (see below)

You hit it right on............... Anyway, keep up the good work. Your very intelligent review persuaded me to buy this when I was of two minds before. (see below)

4332550,4,B004DIPL3Q,"This review is to add a few observations to the general consensus, with which I agree. No one should be dissuaded from purchasing this because I give it, in effect, an A rather than an A-plus.

Maazel lets the music speak for itself. Nothing is over-dramatized, and there were times that I missed the extra punch that some conductors (Solti & Szell, for examples) have given various phrases. The orchestra, not unexpectedly, played gloriously. Oddly, the Philharmonie Berlin was not filled to capacity for this event.

The remainder of my comments deals with the technical quality of the audio, video, and authoring of this Blu-ray disc:

I first have to express surprise that this 2000 performance was captured in HD--I didn't know it went back that far. I would not have been surprised if this were a film transfer since 35mm film is inherently HD, but this is a direct-to-video recording, and it is quite detailed.

The audio, wonderful as it is, could have been better. This may be the only time I have preferred the LPCM stereo track to DTS-HD-MA, the latter adding almost nothing to a sense of space, while slightly muffling things, especially the first violins. The volume adjustments and balances in the microphone mix from the various sections of the orchestra, while too subtle to notice in themselves, had the overall effect of preventing crescendos and climaxes from reaching their full dynamic potential.

The Blu-ray mastering is slightly botched in several ways: (1) in spite of the disc's relative austerity of features, it seems to have been authored with Java, unnecessarily slowing its load time. (2) The authoring language prevents any kind of resume capability should you turn the player off; likewise, there is no bookmarking feature, although one can resume by going to a specific chapter from the menu. Along with this, the disc provides the player with no memory of its audio setting, should one happen not to listen to all of it at once. (3) Time, chapter, and title information are not made available to the player for display either on-screen or on the device's on status window. All this makes it rather inconvenient to divide one's viewing of the 75-minute performance into shorter listening sessions; but considering that the cumulative effect is greater when hearing it all in one seating, these limitations could be considered a good thing. Certainly the audience gets few breaks in the Ring operas themselves, Das Rheingold, for instance being one 2-and-a-half-hour bladder-testing act! Better though, to give the home-theater audience a choice.

I hope that these comments may be of interest to some and that they may somehow filter through to EuroArts, who needs to clean up their act a bit, although I must express profound appreciation to them for stepping in where DG, London, Philips, EMI, & Sony have all failed, namely in providing an adequate number of classical-music Blu-ray releases. From that standpoint, and others, we are very lucky indeed to have this disc.",1313107200,14,3007,5.0160320641282565
4332551,4,B004DIPL3Q,"As a lover of Wagner's music was inescapable the acquisition of the Blu Ray synthesis of the Ring conducted by Maazel with Berlin. Maazel has also distinguished itself by making orchestral version of Tanhauser (Maazel, Tanhauser Without Words, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, 1990, Sony). These versions have led to opposing views that reject (pure Wagnerists) although welcome for other people. I think that in general are welcome, as the first step in attracting new audiences to the Wagnerian operas, which length and complexity can be frightening to the uninitiated.

The Ring without words have few precedents. A version of Leopold Stokowski (partial recording in: Stokowski, London Symphony, 1966, Decca) and  Jos&eacute; Serebrier ( symphonic fragments of the Ring, edited by Stokowski, on a Naxos recording of 2006 with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, with support from the Leopold Stokowski Society). These recordings are fragmented and cannot be compared in magnitude with the Maazel synthesis.

Maazel himself offered his The Ring Without Words in 1988 for Telarc, conducting  the Berlin Philharmonic. This is a recording of almost 70 minutes filled with energy and strength, impacting sound. The video version of 2000 (Blu Ray) has the advantage of offering more music, lasting 83 minutes (13 minutes longer than audio version), in addition to see the director and the orchestra, in high resolution of video.

However, the orchestra is not the same of 1988, now with several new players. Several passages do not have the same force and impact of the audio version. Maazel seems very rigid, even at very expressive moments of the Wagnerian saga. As another reviewer said, striking is the many empty seats in the auditorium, in a country with many wagnerians.

In general, this Blu Ray are welcomed by the work and the synthesis that can attract new interested in the powerful music of Wagner, but this version does not have the force and charm of the audio version of 1988.",1309737600,4,1987,5.19375
4332552,5,B004DIPL3Q,"As is always the case, the Berlin Philharmonic is stunning in it's gorgeous sound.  Lorin Maazel leads the band in the ""complete"" Ring without the singing.  He has arranged most of the major scenes as a continuous wall of magnificence.  Anyone familiar with the Ring will be thoroughly thrilled with this performance.  The orchestra has hired the necessary additional players required by this magnificent music.  I kept imagining how Wagner would have responded to this treatment. Of course, he would probably taken exception to it, as he did with almost everything.  But, I think he would have embraced Mr. Maazel at the end and thanked him, nonetheless.  The DVD is a good introduction to Wagner's music for those who might be reluctant to see or hear the operas.  The various conductors who have waved the stick at this orchestra have transformed the Berlin Philharmonic into a personable and humane organization.  I have ALL of their DVDs (from Amazon) and enjoy them every time I see them, even for the umpteenth time.  Claudio Abbado, and now Sir Simon Rattle, have done wonders to make this group the stirring ensemble it is today.  It is too bad that Lorin Maazel has not done enough with them, at least as far as DVDs are concerned.  The only negative impression I had was that the hall was not packed.  There were many empty seats in the house and I wondered why.  Those who did not attend certainly missed a great performance. I,for one, was re-introduced to this wonderful music, even though I have been a rabid opera lover for decades!",1298073600,9,1548,4.7706766917293235
4332553,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Wagner's Ring ""without words"" is not a novel concept: Stokowski and some of his fellow-conductors have performed orchestral ""syntheses"" of Wagner operas, especially during the 1960s and later. There is nothing sacrilegious about orchestral excerpts from operas, though some critics have sneered at the so-called ""bleeding chunks"". Orchestral excerpts and syntheses will particularly please those who, for one reason or another, have trouble sitting through these endless operas - especially when they are celebrated on consecrated ground in Bayreuth. Maazel and the Berliner Philharmoniker (in huge complement) have recorded this performance in 2000 in the Berlin Philharmonie in excellent video and audio. It is a 78-minute tour de force, for the then 70-year old conductor as well as for the musicians who follow him on the beat and who often have to play grueling long fffs or harmonically challenging passages. In brief: they all work a small miracle, and the performance turns out to be stellar, passionate, powerful, ravishingly beautiful and utterly moving. Maazel lets you feel that underneath Wagner's amassed brass there is existential angst and there lurks the fear of a new era, hand in hand with this poignantly nostalgic last blossoming of late Romanticism. When the performance comes to a close, you will know that this is indeed the twilight of an epoch, for better or for worse. Get it while you can.",1296172800,21,1417,5.274336283185841
4332554,5,B004DIPL3Q,"There is little question in my mind that the most glorious music qua music in Wagner's Ring cycle resides in the sumptuous orchestral 'accompaniment'. Indeed, like many I have enjoyed the orchestral portion of the Ring much more than I have the entire theatrical production itself. Others, like Stokowski, have felt the same way; Stoky made a condensed version of the Ring for orchestra alone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-From-the-Ring/dp/B000000WO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music From the Ring</a>. Loren Maazel did, too, (at the behest of Wieland Wagner no less!) and that's what we get here with Maazel conducting the magnificent Berliner Philharmoniker, a live concert in 2000. (Actually the DVD is taken from TWO live performances from October 17 & 18, 2000.) One big difference between Stokowski's and Maazel's arrangements is that Maazel's is played straight through with no pauses, whereas Stoky's treats each section as complete in itself and with some additional music for endings and the like provided by Stokowski. Maazel has not added a single note of his own. Sometimes this makes for awkward transitions between sections, but this does not in itself ruin the whole. Further, Maazel has provided, in the booklet, a kind of synopsis for each section so that one has an idea of the action as one goes along.

Of course Wagner was a genius of the orchestration and there are few orchestras in the world who can do his music as much justice as the Berliner Philharmoniker; their playing is simply marvelous, rich and voluptuous. One is struck, in this neatly filmed DVD, by how young many of the players of the BPO are and how much enjoyment they are getting from their own participation. Of course, by 2000 the orchestra had undergone massive personnel changes. It's amusing, for instance, to see the marvelous principal oboist, Albrecht Mayer, as a practically baby-faced very young man.

One could wonder whether having a visual record of what is primarily an auditory experience, namely the performance of an orchestral work, is worth having. I submit that it is. This is an endlessly fascinating experience, or at least it was for me. But best of all, we don't have to deal with all those tiresome singers and all that bothersome stage action. And it only takes 75 minutes to get through the whole Ring!

4332557,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Richard Wagner chose to describe his operatic creations as ""Music Dramas"". And the visual and singing aspects of his operas were vital to the overall appreciation of his works. In the special opera house, Festspielhaus, Bayreuth, Germany, that Wagner personally designed just for the production of his own works, the orchestra pit was covered in such a way that the orchestra could not be seen by the audience. This feature made his musical compositions even more prominent. This intense performance, without the staging and singing, provides an invaluable tool to the better comprehension of his mastery of orchestral arrangement and the emotional color that his music uses to enhance the experience of the audience. If you listen to this orchestral performance before approaching the operas in their entirety your understanding of the individual operas will be invaluably benefited.",1382140800,,884,5.413043478260869
4332558,3,B004DIPL3Q,"To start you need to know I've been hooked on the Ring cycle for over 35 years. I know what note follows the previous note. My mind plays the music inside itself. Wagner was a master of transitions, from one scene to the next, and this is where this performance fails. There are no transitions. This recording abruptly jumps from one theme to the next, and is somewhat nerve racking in its incompleteness. I had watched this complete program on Youtube before I bought it, so I knew what I was getting. I wanted to hear this with the Blu-ray audio. I was very impressed with the audio on the Met's new Ring production. This recording makes me wish the Met productions Blu-ray, had an orchestral track only, Yes all 15 hours of it! My love of Wagner's music began with the prelude to Act 3 of Lohengrin, which strangely enough was part of the sound track for the Beatles movie ""Help"".",1382054400,2,883,4.45679012345679

The Berlin Philharmonic remains one of my absolute favorite groups and their playing was stellar as usual.  It's just that Maestro Mazel's personal arrangement from this massive operatic opus wasn't always as smooth as one might hope - some of the transitions from one operatic section to another were a bit on the abrupt side.  It's a disc I enjoyed watching and definitely continue to watch over the years, but it's not my favorite - as good as it is.",1371513600,,775,4.635036496350365
4332561,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Listening to The Ring Without Words made me realize that Wagner's Ring was not strictly German. In fact it is mainly based on Norse Legends from Iceland and other Scandinavian countries. The Norsemen sailed their elegant ships all over the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. They raided monasteries in coastal England, where they found lots of gold. They built the city of Dublin. They sailed their ships on the rivers of Russia and played a major role in the development of that great country. The Nor(se)men in France in 1066 under William the Conqueror built castles all over England and Ireland. After 1066 the Normans moved their base of operations into the Mediterranean Sea, conquering Sicily and other islands.
Today Swedes play a major role in American cities. My sister married one. If you look at the telephone directory for Rock Island,IL,where I grew up, you will see more names like Swanson, Swenson and Johnson than Jones or Smith.
For me, the heart of The Ring is Die Valkure, women warriors like the Amazons of Brazil. I see the women playing in the orchestra, which would have been impossible a century ago. When we get to the end of the Ring, we see the god Wotan, not wise or powerful, but instead making a giant mess of things like the Greek gods did. His daughter Brunnhilde was the model for Athena.

4332566,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Lorin Maazel conducts the Berlin Philharmonic in what Maazel has termed a ""symphonic synthesis"", a suite of the most familiar themes from Wagner's four-night Ring Cycle. The resulting distillation arranged by Maazel is a thrilling non-stop 74 minute musical experience, chronologically telling the story of the highlights of the Ring in music only. This is a great introduction to Wagner's music for the beginner, and a pleasant evening of fine memories for a veteran Wagner fan.

As might be expected from Maazel and the Berlin Philharmonic, the music and its presentation on this Blu-ray disc are top-notch. Other aspects of the production are strange, but do not materially detract from its enjoyment. The disc has no time tracking of any kind, and even the normal timer on the player does not display. Tiny print on the case claims 83 minutes of ""program"" which is likely a typo, as the program is actually 75 minutes, nearly 74 of which is music. One can access the ""chapters' on the disc to ascertain what piece of music is playing and thus where we are in the chronological presentation of the themes, or in order to select a different piece. Experimentation is required to determine how to access this feature and then remove it from the screen without causing the playback to return to the Main Menu; the correct sequence seems to be ""pop-up menu"", select ""chapters"", ""pop-up menu"".  The program listing is available in the booklet that comes with the disc, which also contains a good outline of the story that is being told by the music.

There is no explanation on the disc, nor anything in the enclosed booklet, that reveals the circumstances of this recording. Why, for example, are there empty seats in the house, people seemingly seated in random places like behind the orchestra, many audience members quite casually dressed, and the principal cellist lacking his white bow tie? It almost looks like a dress rehearsal, but no matter, the music is magnificent. Only one ""bonus feature"" is offered, a brief commentary by Maazel on the genesis of the idea for a synthesis of the Ring's music, and the philosophy behind its production.

The stern-faced Maazel stands before the Berlin Philharmonic, and together they deliver well over an hour of exceptional music. As stipulated by Wagner, the orchestra is very large, with four clarinets instead of the usual two, three oboes and an English horn instead of two oboes, four harps instead of one (or none), eight French horns instead of four, two sets of timpani instead of one, and so on through the instrumental lineup. The resultant sound is massive, and glorious. The modest price of this Blu-ray makes it more affordable than a CD, the music quality is great, and the high-definition video is a bonus.

4332574,5,B004DIPL3Q,"Whenever a great work is summarized, or truncated,  the serious reader or listener is skeptical.  The Ring in its glorious 16 hour stretch is a feast for the converted, but often is too much for a  beginner trying to grapple with a large and complex cultural monument.  The Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Lorin Maazel  plays direct quotes from the Ring that are lifted from the orchestral score of the four operas in the order in which Wagner composed them.  The result is a highly organic presentation of the major leitmotifs and important orchestral interludes of the Ring. As such it is an important achievement which will help in  promoting The Ring and winning for it a new generation of admirers.

I appreciate the fact that Maazel in stitching the excerpts together did not alter anything that Wagner wrote, nor did he add any superfluous material.

The result is a compelling sonic  introduction to the musical building blocks of The Ring.  I would have added subtitles to the film which would identify what elements of the RIng were being presented as they were being performed in real time.  This information is available in the notes which come with the DVD, but how much more enllighting they would be if they appeared on the screen as the musicians were playing each excerpt.  This improvement  would be welcome especially by teachers who use the DVD as part of a lesson plan on Wagner's compositional devices and orchestration.

Highly recommended.",1351036800,24,1474,4.887096774193548
8425342,3,B004DIPL3Q,"This Ring without Words (opera without lyrics) is a good idea.  Overall it's OK in the spirit of Stokowski's old Symphonic Syntheses of Wagner.  There are some sections of the Ring that I would have added and others are shortened, so at the end of the day I guess I'd rather assemble my own ""suite"" from other sources.  I like it better than the Neeme Jrvi recording of another ""suite.""

As a video, for those of us weaned on Bernstein's TV (particularly children's) concerts, Maazel is a better conductor to listen to than to watch.  He conducts this complicated assembly of ""bleeding chunks"" from memory which, given the number of tempo changes, is pretty impressive.  But he really has one facial expression...which is rather stern.  I have a sister who is a cellist who performed at the Blossom Festival during the transition from George Szell to Lorin Maazel.  She reported back then that most of her peers didn't feel he was a very nice guy...and that's sorta the way he shows up on screen.

BUT the Blu-Ray is from the BPO's HD setup at the Philharmonie (in Berlin) and is technically fabulous.

I had seen some of this concert on You Tube (in decidedly lower resolution), so I knew what I was getting into.  It's a great souvenir of an ""experiment in Wagner reduction"" but buying the Met Blu-Rays of their production with ""the machine"" is much more rewarding.  If you're a great Maazel fan and a Wagner fan then you're probably the ""target market"" for this...but I'm not sure that population is very large.",1470873600,,1514,4.6716981132075475
8425343,5,B004DIPL3Q,This Blu-ray is an incredible value.  Maazel's beautifully realized symphonic cycle is played with great gusto and sensitivity (especially the woodwinds and brass solos).  Not sure why the audience is so small for a Berliner concert but it gives the audio more resonance and punch.,1464048000,,281,5.222222222222222

8425345,5,B004DIPL3Q,"I've enjoyed the Telarc CD for years and recently got the Blu Ray concert recording. It will be forever one of my favorites. It has been a year now that Maazel died. In 1975, my son was but a nursing babe-in-arms. I took my wife and the baby to Hoch Auditorium at the University of Kansas for a concert by the touring Cleveland Orchestra led by conductor Loren Maazel. We had seats down front and when Maazel came out to stand on the podium at the edge of the stage, he glanced down and noticed my wife nursing the baby, modestly covered by a blanket. Maazel's usual serious expression changed to a beaming smile. He nodded in our direction, turned and facing the orchestra, began the concert. I like to think he was conducting just for us that evening so long ago.",1442361600,,765,4.394366197183099

Whoever said this instrumental only, no libretto version is the essence of the Ring missed the point of why this opera is so very much loved, even by those who are not German speakers:  it is the songs sung by the gods, the Valkyries, etc., that makes this work such a compellingly attractive drama.  The music by itself is insipid by comparison with the full Monty.",1429920000,,448,4.439024390243903
8425349,3,B004DIPL3Q,"I love Wagner's music, and I do enjoy Maazel's condensation of it. But on this recording, Maazel seems bored, and so do the musicians and the audience in the half empty hall. I have since listened to the music without watching the video, and found the music and sound to be OK. The video is below par, as one frequently sees microphones and video cameras; the images also seemed to me to be a bit ""soft"".

Perhaps my negative comments are cause by my recently rewatching what I consider to be the finest live concert video recording of classical music extant: Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Mahler's 2nd Symphony.",1417737600,,631,4.684684684684685

How this made it to the market is a mystery.  The hall is about half full of folks who might have been paid to attend.  The orchestra can't wait to get a beer.  I'm not sure Maazel is enjoying himself.  Frankly, I came away wondering whether the piece is any good.",1415577600,,400,4.116883116883117
