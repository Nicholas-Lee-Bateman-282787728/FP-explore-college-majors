8612388,5,B00F57HVPK,I will be showing this in my class about editing/film making.  I can not possibly imagine a better example for my students to see.  Amazing work and amazing content.,1424131200,3,165,4.655172413793103
8612389,5,B00F57HVPK,"Peter's approach to filmmaking was profound, original, and satisfyingly minimalist. His two short films about his father and mother, in particular, are unforgettable portraits. These two figures seem as archetypal, lonely and distant as much-studied planets, and Peter's stance toward them brings home the enduring mystery of those closest to one's own formation, once they depart. His films form a whole that poses profound questions about the nature of existence.  All this is done without flamboyance or pretension, using the simple strength of plain language and imagery.",1392595200,8,575,5.609195402298851
8612390,5,B00F57HVPK,"I'm not being hyperbolic. Watch this space, and hopefully within a short time you'lll have a chance to see what I mean for yourself. I conducted the two interviews (with the help of Mehrnaz Saeed-Vafa), which were arranged by Peter himself with the help of some others, but this isn't why I'm ranking this package as highly as I do. I discovered the first four of the films on this set over a quarter of a century ago, and they've continued to grow for me ever since then. There will obviously be more to say once this set becomes available, but I'm very happy to see that it's on the way.",1381104000,14,589,4.315315315315315
