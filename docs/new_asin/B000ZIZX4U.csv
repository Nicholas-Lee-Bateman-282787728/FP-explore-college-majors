8235528,4,B000ZIZX4U,"In the past, games have been missing game footage. This DVD has every play. They only edited out one huddle of 32 seconds, but all downs are there. The quality seems like they could put out something better, but it is overall good......I still wish they would just add a 2nd disc and put the entire ORIGINAL feed of the game for sale. They edit out pre game and other things in the game.",1293840000,,387,4.243243243243243
