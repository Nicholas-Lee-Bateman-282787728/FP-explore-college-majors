Anyways, I have the DVD and I have to say it is nothing less than fantastic, and brilliantly made for a very low budget film. Pleasantly surprised is the right phrasing.
Anyways, always wondered what James Hergott was up to these days",1298937600,,381,4.536231884057971
8104561,3,B000E2B04Y,"I thought the movie had a very interesting storyline behind it however, I thought there was way too much screaming and yelling throughout the movie which distracted from the storyline. Most of the arguments and fighting looked too staged and there didn't appear to be a legitimate reason behind most of these arguments. Recognizing that the film was a low budget operation, I thought it was well done and well worth watching and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. Nice job Mr. Hergott....I personally think that you and your company have huge potential in the entertainment industry.",1140739200,,590,5.030612244897959
8104562,5,B000E2B04Y,"My husband and I saw ""All That I Need"" during its limited release in Scottsdale.  It was an interesting commentary on get-rich-quick schemes and how friendships and relationships of all types can fall apart when money is involved.  I myself learned my lesson a long time ago when it comes to money with friends, so it kindof drives home the point when seeing it in ""All That I Need"".

It's funny, dramatic, and tense all at the same time.  It's not a large scale production picture, more of an independent film, and does its job for a smaller film.  There was a lot of buzz for it around the Scottsdale area, I heard about it on a radio station, but it didn't stay long.  I guess you have to have a multi-million dollar ad campaign to stay in the theaters for more than a couple of weeks now.

It contains some foul language and sexual situations, but overall, it's not offensive in the least for its R rating.

I gave it a 5, I would've given it a 4.5, because it's far from perfect, but amazon doesn't offer a half-star option.  I'm feeling generous so I rounded up.

Check this out when it comes out on DVD, you won't be disappointed!

8104563,5,B000E2B04Y,"I should start out by saying I had no idea what I was going to see when I walked into the theater to see ""All That I Need"".  We had either seen everything else or didn't want to see a kid's movie, so we decided to check this movie out.  The only other movie I had ever walked into without a general knowledge of the plot from the trailer was ""From Dusk til' Dawn"".  If you've ever seen that, imagine not knowing anything about the vampire aspect until the crazy medusa chick bites on Quentin.  Yeah, freaked me out.

But I digress.

Fortunately ""All That I Need"" had no vampires.  What it did have, however, was my attention through the whole thing.  It's a documentary type movie about pyramid schemes.  Since I had no knowledge of it to begin with, it was kinda hard to follow at first, but once you understand what is going on (which is conveniently explained in the dialogue), it really kinda sucks you in.  This is no big budget blockbuster (say that five times fast), it's a cleverly conceived independent film that only got a limited run in the theaters, much less than it deserved.  I won't go into anymore details or spoil the rest of it for you.  Since it soon will be out on DVD, I can actually tell people to rent or buy it instead of going through the whole thing because I never thought they'd be able to see it (Sorry Matt!).

Anyway, hope you found this helpful.",1136764800,3,1378,4.315175097276264
8104564,5,B000E2B04Y,I can't wait for this to come out on DVD.  I saw it in Irvine during its limited release.  What a great film!  Its not your usual feature film.  Its like a documentary that goes further than that and gets truly outrageous.  What an essay on the effects of greed.,1136419200,5,262,4.16
