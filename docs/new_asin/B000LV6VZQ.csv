2714523,4,B000LV6VZQ,"I bought most of the series from a guy on ebay. The quality was pretty good overall, certainly worth the $50 I paid for 100 episodes, including the pilot.

The show itself does a nice job of capturing the time. Malden and Douglas were a good tandem.

The 4 act structure was the norm back then. Surf the net a little before you pay 35+ bucks for half a season",1168214400,14,359,4.114285714285714
2714524,3,B000LV6VZQ,"SOSF was one of the best cop shows on TV and exemplified the 70s. Many of us who lived through that era and enjoyed the shows were salivating over the eventual (and LONG OVERDUE) DVD release. When I read an IMDB blog that Amazon had it on pre-order, I rushed to the site.

I was thoroughly disappointed and disgusted that this DVD is PART ONE of Season One! Part One!!! And the price is what you'd expect to pay for a full season on most other TV series, except some like Wiseguy, whose distributors were clearly trying to bloodsuck money from the fans. Clearly, that is the case here, too: when a fan get the full Season One, he/she will pay double. I won't: I'll wait until an Amazon seller drops it down to half price and get it then.

SHAME!!",1167955200,79,746,4.283687943262412

2714526,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Really enjoyed watching these episodes of Streets of San Francisco.
Only complaint, like others, is the way the seasons are being sold. Warner is trying to squeeze as much money out of buyers as they can by parsing them out by discs, instead of selling complete dvd collections of the series",1473292800,2,291,4.7254901960784315

2714535,3,B000LV6VZQ,"I've spoken to a number of people that share my opinion here.

When we were younger, i.e., when this show was playing in prime time or when we watched it in syndication way back when, we were big fans of this show. And why not? How could you go wrong? It's a Quinn Martin production, with the great Karl Malden in the driver's seat.

I watch it now, and I just can't get into it. I get bored with it very quickly. Is it the unremarkable production values (sets, lighting)? Is it the lack of whiplash editing? Yes, things have changed remarkably since then (the show premiered in the early 70's), and cop shows are way different today. However, if this's the case, I should probably dislike other shows from that era that share the same type of production values and lack of whiplash editing. Tough one.

Three stars now, five stars back then. I used to like this show a lot and could never really get enough of it.",1425772800,2,914,4.364705882352941

2714560,4,B000LV6VZQ,"I would've liked to give THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO SEASON 1, VOL. 1 the full five stars but the splitting of the season into two volumes is really stupid. Sure, this volume is priced under $10 and I was actually able to get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Streets-of-San-Francisco-Season-1-Vol-2/dp/B000RZIGSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Streets of San Francisco - Season 1, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;while it was under $10 on sale (though I see the price went up), however subsequent seasons -- also split into two volumes -- are priced just under $30 each. So saving consumers money wasn't the reason for doing this. I just bought Season 2, vol. 1&2, and it cost nearly $70.

Anyway, the series itself is better than I remember it, though I was a child when it aired, and the picture and sound quality on these DVDs are great.

Each episode is presented in four acts and an epilog, and Karl Malden and Michael Douglas have great onscreen chemistry together, one playing the older and wiser veteran of the SFPD (Malden), while the other plays the young hotshot college graduate detective (Douglas), who is a rookie in comparison. The story lines are riveting and the cinematography is fantastic!

When they say ""The Streets of San Francisco"" they mean it! There are plenty of action and outdoor shots all around the Bay Area and I think this is the best part of the show. I always enjoy seeing real street scenery versus a sound-stage, whenever possible, especially of older shows from the 60s-70s, and this show does a spectacular job of doing it.

Like New York City was the fifth character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Gift-Set/dp/B0011UBDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Gift Set)</a>, Karl Malden acknowledges that San Francisco is the third character in THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO in the bonus Archerd interview.

2714563,3,B000LV6VZQ,"The series itself is great, and the quality on the discs was pretty good considering the age of the show.

The problem was the shipping container.  This and two other dvds I ordered were crammed into a tiny box with almost no padding at all.  When I opened it, Streets of San Francisco had been squashed and all the disc cases and holding clips cracked and broken.  The discs were lightly scratched but still played, however the packaging was now useless.

Amazon is too cheap on protecting relatively fragile products, and their choices of shipping partners is quite lousy.  This isn't the first product I've had to return because of shoddy packaging and/or handling by their third or fourth party shippers, i.e. ONTRAC.  If you've ever dealt with ONTRAC you know what I mean.

Did I mention that because it wasn't SOLD by Amazon but only FULFILLED by Amazon, I could get no replacement?  My only option was return for refund.  Keep that in mind too if it's not sold by Amazon directly.

Apparently, none of you are old enough to remember how many more episodes a season lasted and how many FEWER commercials they had back then!  One I looked at had 32 episodes/season compared to 23 now.  We also used to have about 10-15 mins of commercials per hour while today it's more like 20-25!  It's also possible that the older video needs more extensive (and expensive) restoration to bring to DVD.

Do the math and divide the price by the number of episodes and THEN compare to the per-episode pricing of newer (and more poorly written) shows and you'll find that you are getting a pretty good value on these!

Karl Malden (Inspector Stone) plays the mentor & uncle-type figure to the young & handsome ""Inspector Keller"" played by Michael Douglas. Both play off each beautifully & rarely clash despite their age & generational differences. Many Hollywood stars (either already established or just being discovered) appeared on the series.

Here Karl Malden and a Young Micheal douglass are partners with the SFPD and from the theme music on you will enjoy these shows. I fly through these stories and just enjoy the 70's stories and how they were told. The acting is very good and in the 70s shows the members of the cast were so much more limited. The main stars of the programs dominant the screen time which I love. It was a good time as a kid and just pure enjoyment too look back and get a perspective on the stories as an adult. I enjoy them very much . It also great to see some of the guest stars that were growing toward roles that would later define them. This show is great. Get it and enjoy .

2714569,5,B000LV6VZQ,"""The Streets of San Francisco"" aired for five seasons on ABC.  This DVD set contains the movie-length pilot episode and the first 13 hour-long episodes that were broadcast from September 1972 to January 1973 during the show's first season.

The show stars a pair of Academy Award-winning actors in Karl Malden, who plays Lieutenant Mike Stone, and Michael Douglas, who plays Steve Keller, Stone's much younger assistant.  Stone is very street-wise and relies on hunches and intuition, and mentors the college-educated Keller as they solve murders in these action-packed episodes.  ""Streets"" was filmed on location, and does a superb job of incorporating the scenery and some of the famous landmarks of San Francisco and the Bay Area into the show.

Also included is an interview with Malden and Douglas from 1972.  The show even has a cool theme song, and it was fun to see the period cars and clothing styles of the time.  ""The Streets of San Francisco"" is not as famous as some other 1970s crime dramas, but the show finished ranked in the Top 30 for three straight seasons, so it must have had a devoted audience for a time.

2714576,5,B000LV6VZQ,"This is the first half-season's worth of ABC's classic '70's police series, ""The Streets of San Francisco."" For the uninitiated, ""Streets"" was a police drama that starred famed actor Karl Malden as Lt. Mike Stone, a 23-year veteran detective of the San Francisco Police Department. Michael Douglas (who currently does the opening V/O for ""NBC Nightly News"") costarred as his young partner, Inspector Steve Keller. Together, they patrolled the City by the Bay, with Stone acting as a mentor, a father figure if you will, to the rookie Keller. This first half-season's worth (I say that because this series was cut into volumes for DVD release) spanned from Sep. 1972 to the first week of 1973, and included the following outings:

Pilot (a.k.a. ""The Streets of San Francisco"") (9-16-72)

""The Thirty-Year Pin"" (9-23-72)

""The First Day of Forever"" (9-30-72)

""45 Minutes from Home"" (10-7-72)

""Whose Little Boy Are You?"" (10-14-72)

""Tower Beyond Tragedy"" (10-28-72)

""Hall of Mirrors"" (11-4-72)

""Timelock"" (11-11-72)

""In The Midst of Strangers"" (11-25-72)

""The Takers"" (12-2-72)

""The Year of the Locusts"" (12-9-72)

""The Bullet"" (12-16-72)

""Bitter Wine"" (12-23-72)

""A Trout in the Milk"" (1-6-73)

All of the abovementioned outings (including the pilot) are contained on four single-sided discs in two slipcases. The discs are packaged against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge at night. The first and third discs have images of Karl Malden; the second and last discs have images of Michael Douglas. The discs have the names of the outings on the left at the top. The fronts of the slipcases have images from the series on top, the release title near the top, and the disc numbers at the bottom, all against another backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge. The episode listings are on the back of each slipcase. The box says that the first 16 outings of #1 are included; I didn't count 16. I counted only the pilot and 13 regular outings, for a total of 14. Perhaps Paramount thought that the pilot could be split into two separate outings for syndication-- who knows?

This first release has two bonuses, both on Disc 1. The first is a ""pilot presentation"" that details what the series is about, and introduces the characters. Clips from the pilot are used in this 9-min. feature. The other is a short interview conducted by famed entertainment writer Army Archerd with Malden and Douglas; the setting is that of Stone's office.

A lot of people here have been disappointed in the fact that this series was cut in volumes for DVD release. They bemoan the fact that you're paying full-season prices for only half-season releases, therein paying the price of two normal full-season releases to get a full season's worth of a volume series. This is seen by some people, I believe, as a profit-maximizing measure for Paramount. The volume format (as used for this series and several others), once you finish all of the outings in a specific volume, leaves you wanting more. I know I am-- this first release of ""Streets"" had some pretty darn good entertainment for a `70's series.

In short, despite the fact that ""Streets"" was cut in volumes for DVD release, this first release gets my personal purchase recommendation because of the sheer entertainment value.",1229126400,7,3260,4.961397058823529
2714577,5,B000LV6VZQ,"After watching the whole first season and half of the second, I now realize why I don't care for the new shows.

2714578,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Excellent to see this out at last on DVD, even if I do have to buy an import.  It hasn't been on TV over here for years. My all time favourite cop show. Having been to SF, it's nice to see some of the landmarks again.",1219795200,2,217,3.717391304347826
2714579,5,B000LV6VZQ,"I'll let others describe the episodes.  Presumably, you are here because you already know something about this maverick 1970's cop TV drama, and my rating reflects you are that type of person.  If your idea of good TV is I Survived A Japanese Game Show, this may not be for you.  In addition to Hawaii Five-0, another good series of this era now on DVD is The Rookies.

What I noticed immediately was the sound and video transfer to DVD was excellent.  It's almost creepy to see SOSF in such high fidelity.  The episodes make a lot more sense now that I've grown up and understand a bit more about inner city, 1970's culture!  And to me, they seem to hold up very well.  The writing is very good.  Some language and clothing styles are a bit dated (well heck, that's part of the fun), but the stories move along, particularly without commercials butting in every 10 minutes.  There are also several moments of humor in many episodes.

I've visit San Fran a few times in the last two years, and it's wonderful to see some of the shots of neighborhoods.  If you enjoy this nostalgia or even live there or have lived there, I think you'll get some bonus enjoyment from the series.  And seeing those big Chryslers and Matadors fly two feet off the ground while driving down hills with 30 degree inclines...it's a thing of beauty.",1215475200,4,1325,4.493723849372385
2714580,5,B000LV6VZQ,"""The Streets of San Francisco"" was one of the best cop shows of the 1970s and its wonderful that it is finally available on DVD. The formula was similar to other cops shows, but seemed to have more realistic story lines. This release marks the first time the Pilot has been seen in many years. When the episodes re-air on TV, the pilot is usually not shown since it was 98 minutes long, so it was a definite treat to see how the show started and what made the show so interesting.

I think the reason that Karl Malden's Mike Stone and Michael Douglas' Steve Keller worked so well is because their characters were completely different - Stone was raised on the streets of San Francisco and Keller was a college educated cop, but yet they had one thing in common, the pursuit of justice. I think it also helped that Karl Malden knew Michael's father, legendary actor Kirk Douglas, since before Michael was born. The chemistry between the two actors was undeniable and you could tell they both had fun shooting together, which was made even more evident after Douglas left the series at the beginning of the shows final season and was replaced by actor Richard Hatch.

The colors and audio have been enhanced on this DVD and makes the show look even better than it originally aired back in the early 1970s on ABC. This show was well renowned for its ability to get major guest stars and even have stars who later became famous in their own right, years after appearing.

Also included are two special features. One features Douglas and Malden being interviewed on the set of the show by legendary interviewer Army Archerd before the show began airing in September 1972. The other is a 9 minute Pilot Presentation which summarizes what the show is about. Both are thoroughly entertaining and wonderful to see all these years later. All in all this DVD set is a wonderful trip back in time to the good ol days of partner crime drama.",1198108800,2,1928,4.566473988439307
2714581,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Agreeing with nearly every reviewer here about the quality of the show and the greediness of Paramount to not have the whole first season on these discs for the price you'd normally pay for a complete season, I have to add alittle about the show's appeal to someone who wasn't aloive at the time of its airing. I grew up in the 80s, but the residual culture of the 70s was quite strong in my neighborhood and childhood television experience. Watching this show brings me right back to all that was well with the world of my youth with its fros, leisure suits, big cars, loud colors and cymbol tinking sound tracks when the cops sneek around at night. And i love how you can see the mics under the casts' shirts and the camera in the windows' reflections. Or how the dead can be seen breathing or blinking. So refreshing compared to the over-hyped and over-gross details of death, murder and sex that are soooooo pervasive today. And the camera work is great. No jumping aorund like Law and Order to give you a headache! Oh how I wish the 70s and early 80s were still here. Every age has it's own sense of innocence when thought back upon, and this show captures that for me. Sounds wierd, but maybe you understand too.

The plots of SoSF are pretty good, the pace relaxing and the acting/guest appearances are superb. Buy this set (used?) or get it like I did at the library. Good times indeed! Enjoy!",1180915200,30,1401,4.45136186770428

2714591,4,B000LV6VZQ,"Great series. Great San Francisco locations.  As a Bay Area native, who can resist this detective series brilliantly acted and, to some degree, a fairly realistic protrayal of the procedural aspects of routine police work.  Much has already been said about the perfect casting of Malden and Douglas in their respective roles, but also for the number of quality guest stars that are featured; in fact, many who were household names during the 50's,60's, and 70's--Edmund O'Brien, Janice Rule, James Stacey, William Windom, David Soul, Paul Michael Glaser, Andrew Duggan, Edward Mulhare, and Stephanie Powers to name a few in this first distinguished set.

I am particularly fond of one episode in this set, ""The Bullet,"" a episode about a blackmailed professor who is shot and refuses to have the bullet extracted for fear of adverse publicity and loss of his tenure.  The college campus is none other than my alma mater, the University of San Francisco.  (In another season, historic Ralston Hall in Belmont, CA, on the campus of Notre Dame de Namur University where I also attended, served as the setting for yet another episode of ""Streets."")

The series served a springboard for Academy Award winner Douglas' foray into motion pictures. The series would enjoy a tremendous long run with Richard Hatch (Battlestar Galatica) taking over Douglas' role. But the series quickly fizzled as clearly the chemistry between Malden and Douglas was absent.

Douglas would leave the series to star in two very important movies that would launch his film career: ""Coma"" (1978) and following that, ""The China Syndrome"" with Jack Lemmon and Jane Fonda.

This box set would easily earn 5 stars had CBS DVD been more generous and released all of season one, and not just the first 16 episodes and really some very paltry extras: a promo for the pilot episode and a pretty useless Army Archerd (who was he anyway?) interview--obviously a PR piece for Quinn Martin.  A commentary with Michael Douglas would have been most welcome and expected.",1178755200,4,2026,5.023880597014926
2714592,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Well, maybe for some of you is a stretch, but when it is in rotation on one of our local UHF stations, invariably it is a print that shows it's age. You notice these things when you don't have cable or satelite, etc.

The re-mastering job is nothing short of masterful. This show, always a favorite of mine, is one I never seem to tire of. The guest stars, supporting cast, and the beautiful locale all seal the deal. I even enjoy it more when they are driving past a service station and you see the gas prices of $0.37!",1177891200,3,520,4.2
2714593,5,B000LV6VZQ,"During the final part of Act IV of the Thirty Year Pin, I was literally breathless for about five minutes, it was so tense!  I can't honestly think of the last time I watched a modern drama and sat perfectly still for that long.

I remember watching this in syndication as a youngster, and frankly, it's better than I remember.  The old cop/young cop dynamic is great, and well played by Malden and Douglas.

This is old fashioned television with long, long shots and takes, few cuts, actors acting with their whole bodies/body language/walk and all that.  Unlike a lot of modern shows--tension comes from the story instead of frenetic editing.  Some episodes have these amazing 2 and a half minute tracking shots where Malden and Douglas walk and talk, pause and talk, walk and talk with no editing cuts--it's all one take!  It's down a corridor to end at the boss's office in the pilot, and there's one outside near fisherman's wharf in 45 minutes from home.  It's really something to see and gives the show a different feeling from modern tv.

Something I only noticed after watching a few episodes--the opening credits are sort of a day in San Franciso--it's morning at the start, you cross the bridge and hit the wharf, daytime city scenes follow with the cops.  It's afternoon about the time the guest stars roll around, and it all ends with nightime along the roads of the red light district.  Very cool, indeed!

You can't go wrong with this set--I'm enjoying it more than I thought I would.  Malden and Douglas are giving it their all, San Francisco is beautiful, and the 70s look mighty gritty.",1177459200,12,1604,4.665480427046264

The Streets of San Francisco is just brillant TV! Great writing, great acting, and great scenery - vintage 70's San Francisco! The set DOES include the two hour pilot, and the transfer is crystal clear, the audio is on par for mono 70's TV, not great but certainly listenable! Back in the 70's I don't think the audio engineers expected we would be watching their programs in 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround systems in our home theaters or living rooms. I also don't approve of splitting the Season into 2 parts, I stopped buying a lot of Fox-TV on DVD (such as the Irwin Allen series - Lost In Space, Voyage to The Bottom Of The Sea, etc.)for that reason. I am glad I purchased The Streets of San Francisco - I have enjoyed it so much! Please release the next season as a complete box set, not split into parts please Paramount.

What I don't get though is this, the production clearly states it was made by ""Warner Brothers"", it aired on ABC -TV in the 70's, so how did it become a CBS-DVD / Paramount release? That's weird.",1177200000,6,1221,4.450892857142857

refuse to ship for more than five weeks.  My guess is that with all the
discounted items, they feel they aren't making enough profit off of me to
ship the items to me in a timely manner.  They seem to WANT me to cancel
to avoid fulfilling my order at the price they advertised.

Oh well, I used to like Amazon - but I can certainly obtain all of the
items I wanted locally, for about the same price, in one day.  [...]

This is great, I love watching this show and looking at the San Francisco I grew up in and comparing it to the city today.  Notice all the vacant lots around town, I used to play in a lot of those lots and catch lizards when I was a kid, seriously.  I also played in some of the boarded up victorians which were torn down and some floated across the bay to build new cheap stuff,and they call that progress! Get real. Anyway, I'm happy with the picture quality, Malden's eyes are so piercing blue, and I noticed it's a CBS video?  I guess it took time for it to come out since CBS didn't want to let go of it (sell it)?  The only thing that bothers me in the series is that sometimes it shows them in Portrero Hill, and then 5 minutes later they have droven all the way to North Beach, impossible even back then with only 1/2 the traffic and cars. Why they make flaws like this I have no idea, same flaw showed up in Dirty Harry Movie when Clint chases a guy through North Beach, and then it shows the streets at 24th and Mission, and then back to North beach in the same foot chase... These flaws are sometimes irritating if one knows the city like me.",1176595200,,1222,4.139240506329114

Second, the quality of the video is really surprisingly good. Third, seeing San Francisco in 1972 is like time travel - worth the price of the DVD right there.

This show wasn't produced on fake soundstages or in Los Angeles, as was McMillan and Wife. This was done all right here in San Francisco. As a current longtime resident of this city, I'm intrigued at how life was here back then.

Karl Malden and Michael Douglas were a great team together and although this show was made following a simple forumula, they made the best of it. It isn't Masterpiece Theatre, but it does the job better than a lot of old cop shows.",1176249600,8,755,4.385714285714286
2714611,4,B000LV6VZQ,"I'm surprised that this Quinn Martin production has come to DVD with so many other Martin shows (""The Invaders"", ""The Fugitive) left in limbo. I'm going to give this 4 stars for the series, 3 for the extras and 2 for only giving us half a season. I don't want to discourage fans from buying it because studios usually release these half season sets to gage whether or not it will sell well enough to keep putting it out.

Regardless, ""Streets"" was a fine series and introduced Michael Douglas to many people. The real star here though is Karl Malden who LIVES in the skin of his character of Lt. Mike Stone. Actually shot on location in San Francisco, the show may have aged a bit but the performances, writing, guest stars and deft direction by a parade of TV veterans keeps the show entertaining despite the passage of time. I was always a fan of this show and while the passage of time has diminished many great shows, this wouldn't be one of them. Sure, it's not geared towards our ""story arc"" based audience but the episodic nature of the series works well for this series quite well.

 The show looks pretty good here with nice colors and image quality. Some of the shots look a bit soft here and there but overall the show continues to look very good. The original mono audio sounds clear as well. I still love that propulsive opening theme music.

We don't get any featurettes or commentary tracks (a pity because it would be interesting to hear Douglas' assessment 30 plus years later of his performance and that incredible hair). We go get a nice vintage interview from 1972 with Douglas and Malden on the set of the show. We also get a ""pilot presentation"" reel.

Although lacking in new special features, the vintage ones are quite good for this set. Paramount/CBS unfortunately has taken the strategy that Fox has with many of their vintage shows and decided to release this (along with ""The Untouchables"") in half season sets which will be frustrating for fans of the show. I just hope it doesn't discourage too many fans from purchasing this set as they are no doubt looking at sales to gage the release of the rest of the seasons of the series.",1176163200,13,2160,4.5424164524421595

Martin was the producer for such popular series as The Untouchables, The FBI, Cannon, and Barnaby Jones.

The Streets of San Francisco followed the pattern of most of Martin's shows. There were divided into three acts and an epilogue, and the guest stars were introduced at the beginning of each episode. The show feature veteran, Oscar-winning actor Karl Malden (who during this time starred in a series of popular commercials for American Express credit cards) and Michael Douglas, son of Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas.

Malden played veteran SF homicide cop Mike Stone, who was newly paired with rookie detective Steven Keller, played by Douglas. Following the Naked City model of police dramas, Stone showed the green Keller the ropes of policing the city while Keller used his criminology decree and understanding of modern technology to balance the equation. Darleen Carr has an occasional role as Stone daughter and Keller's eventual love interest.

This was a solid, enjoyable series and the teaming of Malden and Douglas was an excellent one. This show is one that is still entertaining almost forty years later.",1173052800,4,1327,5.25
2714620,2,B000LV6VZQ,I continue to REFUSE to purchase Season DVD sets broken into volumes! It's rediculous and GREEDY!  The price will drop as they sit on the shelves!,1172534400,18,146,4.615384615384615
2714621,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Okay..

  Remember, this is a T.V show..so..it is tame and somewhat..less..than we currently expect..obviously..in terms of plot etc..SO what OTHER aspects warrent the purchase?

  Well..for me, and..for anyone who was born, lived/lives in Northern California..or The City as it's known by almost everyone North of Frisco..well..this is a treat..

  See the City BEFORE it bacame what it is today..which is..a TREND..a place to live for people who simply PURCHASED it AWAY from the people who built it..it's hard to imagine Gentrification of a WHOLE CITY..but so it is..thank the force of benevolent intelligence for Prop 13..or no one born in California without a silver spoon would still be here..and in this series..you get the tour..""Old Frisco""

  Episodes that include old Murals..(like the ""Jo Boc"" mural by R.Crumb on the Mission Community Center..Douglas and Malden have a scene in front of it..and of course...it is GONE today..) and the streets of San Francisco..of course..as seen in perhaps the HEYDAY of the city...

  For me, born in the city in '68..it is a treat to see the city of my childhood..the Purple Hippo Restaurant, the old Frisco..the way it was before ""Yuppies"" ruined it forever..

  Also, this series is worth the Guest Star list...Our...illustrious(?) Governor...Der Arnold...appears..and MANY others..well worth it as a window into the history of the city, and of American culture..c'mon..it's The Streets of San Francisco...circa the 70's....it's great..and heartbreaking at the same time...",1169510400,28,1524,5.44017094017094
2714622,4,B000LV6VZQ,"THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO was one of the best crime dramas of the 70's, featuring screen veteran Karl Malden as Lieutenant Mike Stone and rising star Michael Douglas as Inspector Steve Keller. The series was produced by Quinn Martin and filmed on location in the City By The Bay.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about STREETS, besides the solid scripts and beautiful location scenery, was its powerhouse roster of guest stars. The series featured performances by many top actors from both new and old Hollywood, including Martin Sheen, Joseph Cotten, James Woods, Ida Lupino, John Ritter, Leslie Nielsen, Patty Duke, Nick Nolte, Rick Nelson, Larry Hagman and even a young Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Michael Douglas left the series in 1976 to pursue a movie career. His final episode was the two-part fifth season premiere, ""The Thrill Killers"", about a radical organization that kidnaps an entire jury. The story was inspired by the Patricia Hearst kidnapping case, which was still making headlines at the time. Douglas was replaced by Richard Hatch for the final year.

The first season has quite a number of outstanding segments, and it's great to see it finally coming out on DVD.  Praise should go to the artist who did the cover design -- it's one of the coolest DVD covers I've seen in quite some time.  Yes, having the season split up into two separate volumes is questionable, but regardless of how it's released, THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO is definitely worth adding to anyone's classic TV collection.",1168300800,69,1515,4.996031746031746
8164405,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Great series! BUT - i've gone through two versions of this (Amazon replacements) and disc 2 will not play in my blu-ray player (these are regular DVDs). I've read other reviews having similar problems. It will play in my computer disc drive no problem, so there's that. Just be forewarned that you may experience playback issues on some of the discs. Disc 2 seems to be authored differently than the others in the set. Very strange.

But - for ""shot entirely on location in San Francisco"" - you can't beat it. It's SF of old, before redevelopment, gentrification and all the rest. Still full of Southern Pacific railroad tracks embedded everywhere in the gritty parts of town. Enjoy!",1526256000,,683,4.788135593220339

8164407,5,B000LV6VZQ,"Picture quality is remastered and drop dead gorgeous. A bargain of a price i you pay $10 or less since the complete series is also available in a box set for $50 (all five seasons). Not much in the way of bonus extras in this DVD set but fear not! James Rosin wrote a book about THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO that documents the history of the television program, with lots of trivia. Mr. Rosin went so far as to interview Michael Douglas, Richard Hatch, producers John Wilder and Cliff Gould, Ed Hume who wrote the television pilot that launched the series, directors William Hale and Walter Grauman, write D.C. Fontana, script supervisor Michale Preece, and many others. He lets their recollections tell the story in chronological order. Included are production schedules, Broadcast Standard Memos, research reports, an episode guide and lots of behind-the-scenes photographs. The book is also available on Amazon.com If you plan to buy this DVD set, I recommend you buy the book as well as a perfect companion. Treat yourself.",1514937600,,1027,4.908045977011494

It was a series of it's time, I just find it rather badly written and over-acted now. Guess it's all relative to it's time.
still fun, tho",1486080000,,202,4.205128205128205
