4396198,4,B004K9WZJG,I really enjoyed this dvd. Nice wide open spaces and wonderful scenery. Has the added options of exploring the area with information on the way. Well done.,1333756800,3,155,4.777777777777778
4396199,4,B004K9WZJG,"Even though we can view the reviews about this item, we can't buy it and have it shipped to a Canadian address.  Why can't this item be shipped to Canadian addresses?",1326585600,,166,4.354838709677419
4396200,5,B004K9WZJG,"I am quite enjoying this video.  It's almost like hiking outside, and in the gorgeous scenery of Ireland at that!  All while being safe, sound and comfortable in my home...what a great concept.  I hope they make more TrekIreland videos...I would LOVE to explore more of Ireland in this manner.",1326240000,7,293,4.82
4396201,5,B004K9WZJG,"As I have walked these paths MANY times, when not disabled...I wanted a
reminder and encouragement. Both accomplished!
Not at all shaky...but good steady filming.
WELL DONE!",1307836800,6,173,5.444444444444445
4396202,2,B004K9WZJG,"Too slow I was expecting  it to be faster, it was too slow in the beginning which bored me from the start. The scenery was beautiful and it was informative.",1362873600,,156,4.2
4396203,5,B004K9WZJG,"I bought this for my mother as a birthday present, and she's had a wonderful time walking on the treadmill while watching it. The scenery is varied and interesting so she doesn't get bored, and she also likes the parts where the host stops and gives you some information on where you are. All in all, I recommend this for anyone who wants to keep themselves occupied while walking on the treadmill.",1362355200,,398,4.541666666666667
4396204,5,B004K9WZJG,"This DvD is precisely what I was looking for. Lets face it, you can only listen to the same workout mix so many times.

I have a 54"" Samsung DLP tv setup right in front of my treadmill and play this DvD, as I exercise, it's about as good as being there without the incredibly long flight. :) I would highly recommend this video, and will def be on the lookout for the next in this series.",1362096000,5,388,4.038961038961039
4396205,5,B004K9WZJG,I really liked this DVD. I liked the ability to choose trails and the ability to stop and listen to the historical story of the area.,1361318400,,133,4.153846153846154
4396206,3,B004K9WZJG,"Nice workout.  Very nice scenery and I love that you can get details as you go, but then I tend to stop walking to listen!  All in all a good change from my normal aerobics/walking videos.",1360022400,,188,4.194444444444445
4396207,5,B004K9WZJG,I really enjoy this DVD.  It really does feel like I'm taking a hike through the forest.  I can ' t wait to see more in this series.,1357257600,4,132,3.6785714285714284
4396208,2,B004K9WZJG,"I found this video impossible to walk with because the camera moves so slowly. I like to start at 3.5 mph, but that was way too fast; the rate in the video was more like 1 mph. It felt like I was stumbling because the scenery was moving by so slowly, compared to the speed at which I was walking. I tried all the walks, and they're all painfully slow; even the one called ""Miner's Road Run"" seems to be the same speed as the others, with the sound of a jogger's feet hitting the path being the only difference.

I looked all over the packaging and the DVD to see if there was some option somewhere, somehow, to make it go faster, but no luck.

I noticed too there are often moments where the video does this sort of blurred transition - hard to describe - where it seems like they had to edit out a hiker or something. It broke the walking mood for me. In some places it happens every few seconds. Even the ""babbling brook"" warm up, where it's just a shot of a brook like you're standing still and looking at it, is pieced together like this, and it's only five minutes long. By the way, it irritated me, too, that the menu doesn't say how long each walk is, or if it's even a walk at all (""Sunrise"" is also a motionless view).

Also, the ""additional information"" icon that pops up once in a while is gigantic and crude. When you click it, you get the guy standing still in front of a view and talking to you, so again, it breaks the whole walking mood thing. It would've been so easy to put the guidebook stuff on an alternate audio track. I did like that the audio was just the ambient sounds of the trail, not cheesy music or ""encouraging words.""

Overall, it seems to be nicely done, and the views are certainly lovely and restful, but the super-slow pace makes this unusable for me.",1357171200,4,1787,4.216374269005848
4396209,5,B004K9WZJG,"I love they way Trek Ireland organizes their video's, you can just let is run and enjoy your workout, or you can explore the area at almost every turn.",1353888000,3,151,4.241379310344827
4396210,4,B004K9WZJG,don't even remember buying this.. January's almost here - I'll have to look for it. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new.,1353542400,,144,4.37037037037037
4396211,5,B004K9WZJG,I purchased this DVD to use on my treadmill and was so excited to recieve it. Unfortunately something was wrong with the DVD but I contacted Jake and he sent me a new DVD at no additional charge and it worked perfectly! Not only did he send me a new DVD but he checked up on the situation to make sure I was satisfied. Jake obviously loves his work and wants to share it with anyone interested in his beautiful country. I would definately recommend the DVD's and working with Jake.,1344556800,3,481,4.2967032967032965
8432641,5,B004K9WZJG,fantastic! Makes walking on my treadmill a really great experience.,1437177600,,67,5.8
8432642,2,B004K9WZJG,"Compared to DVDs like the ones by Virtual Active or Virtual Walks, this is so boring!  And the fact that the camera bounces up and down slightly makes me dizzy too.  I would not recommend this.",1407024000,,193,4.333333333333333
8432643,4,B004K9WZJG,"This is the first DVD Treadmill workout I've ever seen or purchased.

I like this DVD, because I was able to check out sights that having been there, didn't see originally.  I also like the option to listen to the tour guide.

The downside is, it's a wee bit awkward if your pace is faster than that of the DVD, but still doable.  Also, I wish the workouts were a little bit longer.

I would recommend this DVD treadmill workout, and if you didn't want to hear the tour guide, I would suggest listening to your own tunes while enjoying the walk.",1395878400,,545,4.303921568627451
8432644,2,B004K9WZJG,"Parts of the video are filmed on a woods trail. A continuous tunnel of trees is sort of boring. OTH where the scenery is more open, the view is much more enjoyable. Overall, the forested trails are not very interesting and detract from the overall experience. I think I would have been much more involved in the video if the director had filmed a hiker walking the path.",1393027200,,370,4.455882352941177
8432645,4,B004K9WZJG,"I really enjoy this dvd, I like that It is interactive, I can pick a trail, listen to the history, or just walk.  I am going to find more like this.  Thanks.",1392854400,,157,3.875
8432646,5,B004K9WZJG,"This is wonderful, it inspires me to walk! The quietness for me can also be a time of reflection and prayer! WE visited Ireland and were in love with the country. This takes me back every time. Can't wait to get more!",1390608000,,217,4.190476190476191
8432647,2,B004K9WZJG,I was disappointed with the DVD. I guess I had expected something more along the lines of Virtual Active DVD's,1388707200,,110,4.55
8432648,2,B004K9WZJG,"poorly spliced and edited.  jumpy and has cuts.  scenes of Ireland are beautiful, but hard to watch with the unsteady camera work.",1369353600,,130,4.863636363636363
8432649,5,B004K9WZJG,This is a great walking DVD.  You get to see the beautiful countryside of Ireland plus you have a tour guide who at various points during the DVD gives you a bit of the history of the different sites (if you so chose or you can bypass him) featured.  Very enjoyable - thanks!,1368489600,,275,4.169811320754717
8432650,5,B004K9WZJG,"TREK IRELAND

This DVD is a welcomed and enjoyable addition to my otherwise boring treadmill workouts. Others have commented that the pace is too slow. For me personally, it is not overly important if I move faster than the video pace, I can still judge my distance and progress by where I am on the trail accompanied with my treadmill readouts. Also, a greatly appreciated unintended benefit is not being chased along by blood sucking insects. Is it just me, or do the mosquitoes get worse every year?
The scenery in the DVD has a pleasant and relaxing stress relieving quality to it. The guide buttons give insight to local Irish history along with the added benefit of extending your workout time. Here is a tip, on the Poulanaas Waterfall & Spinc trail, when, at a fork in the trail, you click on the guide button, the guide says, ""from here you can take the left trail that goes up to the Spinc and offers fantastic views of the upper and lower lakes,"" let me just say, it is a powerful long and steep climb for a view where the distant lake takes on the same appearance as a puddle on my tree-lawn after a heavy rain, if your making the climb for the workout, great, if your making the climb for the view, save your strength.
Trek Ireland is somewhat of an unexpected paradox, if you are into yoga, or meditation, you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD, as it melds that same serenity along with a vigorous self-paced cardio workout. To paraphrase an Irish toast; ""if you run fast enough you can be in heaven a half an hour before the devil knows your dead."" I'm not sure if that is true, but it can't hurt to try. I give this Trek Ireland 5 stars, you will enjoy breaking a very placid and invigorating sweat.
Ta la iontach!
