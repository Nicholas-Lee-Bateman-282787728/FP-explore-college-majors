49643,4,0783114907,"This is one of my Top Ten favorites of all time. I am a huge Patsy Cline fan and although this movie is just a dramatization of the actual events of this remarkable woman's life, I feel that Jessica Lange portrays Patsy with  the spunk that Patsy herself was known to be filled with. If you loved Coal  Minor's Daughter and you are a Country Music fan or if you just love a  great movie this is a must own for you.",914803200,2,414,4.024390243902439

49680,5,0783114907,"Patsy Cline, in my estimation, was the greatest woman country-western singer who ever lived. The fact that she died so young in that airplane crash took away a great talent. I'd bet she could have been singing well into her senior years and not have lost a thing from her outstanding voice.  It is too bad that Charlie Dick lived up to his last name.  He didn't make her life any easier, that's for sure.",1516752000,,404,4.373333333333333

49721,5,0783114907,"Jessica Lange should have gotten an Academy Award, but was cheated because they gave one the year before for Coal Miner's daughter.
Jessica was much better. The chemistry between Jessica and Ed Harris was so great. If you are a cigarette smoker and needed a match, you could have just lite it of your TV screen while those two played scenes together.
Great supporting cast as well. 5 Stars BIGTIME!",1501027200,,398,4.7

49723,5,0783114907,"I watched this movie when it came out in the 80s. I've always been a Patsy Cline fan. Jessica Lange is great as Patsy. As a matter of fact all of the cast are perfect in their roles. I'm glad they used Patsy's own voice for the music in this film as no one else in the world has a voice like her. I saw Beverly Diangelo in Coal Miner's daughter but I didn't like her portrayal of Patsy as much nor that she sang Patsy's songs herself. Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones are amazing in that one though. I definitely recommend both movies. A little Easter egg, in one scene where a pregnant Patsy stands over a record player you can see a framed picture of Dolly Parton as a child on the mantle above the fireplace.",1498694400,,711,4.122302158273381

49806,2,0783114907,"Young Ed Harris has a coon to make some time with Patsy Cline. Only because that is the singer's name; however, it's Jessica Lange providing a normal teenage? girl with a hankering to be a star and have some funtimes she can geegaw about to her mom.

Patsy Cline as played here, is flat and normal, spiced with constant dose of cliche, and corny yodeling jutting in each song, like Jay Leno's famous chin. Patsy Cline I know of has life, in a flat cover pic, and attitude with depth. I also, besides the character/s, a loss, was expecting some lovingly shot rambles and long shots in a Tennessee setting. The movie promisingly began with a city lane of cars and houses.

I'll never know. I bought a used VHS, stopped at about 15 minutes and I made it no farther. I don't mind a Hollywood picture, or story, but this is cornball with a spicy perfume.",1470268800,,849,4.401273885350318

49841,5,0783114907,"This is another movie about a well known country singer Patsy Cline played by Jessica Lange.
I never thought that she is a pretty actress but whenever she appears in the movie, she rocks the screen. That is her.
This movie is not an excepttion. I don't know the singing part was dubbed or she really sang but it was really touched me deeply.
Later I found out that the singing parts are all PAtsy's true songs.
Anyway, not like other singers, she had a pretty rough life. She had a car accident and had to rest for awhile when she becomes famouse and it took a prett amount of time to go back in businesss, and it was a plane crash that she died when she was in her peak.
In nowadays I fell deeply in love with country music. It's been like this for over maybe 5 years. It reminds me of American rural life which I've never experienced but I do know how peaceful it will be.
I am not white but I can feel it.
Ed Harris is doing his job well as usual. She was a bit young in this film.
The story flew well and for 2 hours even though I watched this film at 12 am, I never felt boring.
This film can be comparable to Coal Miner's Daughter in a good way.
If you like music and you are a music fan, this is a fine present for you.
But this time it's going to be a sad movie.",1458950400,2,1270,3.945525291828794

When the ancient master tape came to light this movie had to be made. The audio quality of her recording tracks was superb, but the accompaniment was not always up to present day standards.  So, a new mix was made using her original tracks and newly recorded accompaniment.  A technical masterpiece.  Also. kudos to Jessica Lange for flawless lip syncing.
Of course Patsy's singing is the best.  The plot is loosely based on her life, but follows most closely with the emotions of the songs.",1453507200,,653,4.701754385964913

50045,5,0783114907,This is a good solid movie that covers the few years of the singing career of Patsy Cline. Ed Harris and Jessica Lange  give very strong performances with neither one over shadowing the performance of the other. Of course the singing voice of Patsy Cline lifts the movie to  5 star rating. The tragedy of her death at such a young age is also the tragedy of the loss of one of the greatest and most beautiful singing voices of all time.,1420675200,3,436,4.304878048780488

50064,4,0783114907,"Jessica Lange hits all the right notes in this great movie about Patsy Cline's rise to country music fame.  Even if you just close your eyes and listen to the music, Patsy Cline's singing is wonderful, even if you don't like country music. I think there are some historic inaccuracies in the movie, but the truest part of the movie is Patsy's pure voice and vocalistic style.  The movie makes you feel like you know Patsy a bit, and since her life was tragically cut short, the movie keeps her present, and as always her voice is sublime.

50216,5,0783114907,"Sweet Dreams is a dream of a movie. Jessica Lange radiates in this film, as she does in most of her films, the exuberant and vibrant joy of a child on the night before Christmas. And the emotion always seems completely genuine, as if it comes from the actress as a person rather than from an actress in a role. Lange's chemistry with Ed Harris and Ann Wedgeworth, who plays Cline's mother, is fine indeed, and among the three of them passes an abundance of truly amusing (and often raunchy) on-screen humor. Lange lip-syncs all of the songs masterfully. You can see that her heart was in every note. You can't ever tell that she's lip syncing.

The production design in this film is marvelous. The downright grubbiness of the various environments Cline inhabited is extraordinarily convincing. There is not a single scene in the entire movie that looks like a stage set.

Karel Reisz was a director of great sensitivity. His films seem to leap off the screen into real life. If you're old enough to remember when Patsy Cline's voice papered the air waves, by all means see this. And if you're not, after you watch Sweet Dreams you may wish that you were. Cline was a musician of emotional power.

John Goodman, in this early film role for him, is charmingly funny, and in fact everyone in the film seems perfectly cast. This one's a winner. This one's worth your nickel.",1379376000,4,1370,4.60655737704918

Then I realized that she was only 30 years old when she died. She never had the chance to live up to her potential, to stop making so many mistakes. And, I realized that with her background and lack of education she was apparently never exposed to any other lifestyle. She must have married her first husband at a very young age. I always had the impression that she was widely loved by fellow artists and the other people she worked with. This is not portrayed in the movie. Rather, she is portrayed as being hard to get along with in some instances. I think they missed the boat on a lot of the characterization of this wonderful singer.",1368230400,,759,4.382978723404255

50243,4,0783114907,"I had just finished Honky Tonk Angel when I'd watched this movie for the second time, so some of the inaccuracies where hard to take.  Maybe it was the 80's when women women were just starting to come out of the victim mentality that bothered me so much.  Sure Patsy had her ups and downs with her second husband Charlie Dick, but if he was as horrible in real life as he was portrayed in the movie, then a woman strong enough to make it as a singer, surely would have thrown his sorry self out early on.  From what I read in the book, Patsy was more than able to handle herself, and was quite coarse herself.

On film, she's a sweet victim with an amazing voice.  Hardly what her friends said.  Patsy actually balked against doing a pop song like Walking After Midnight.  She said she felt like a prostitute doing pop. All she wanted to do was country, which she did at first. The film only concentrated on the pop hits she sang, not the country songs she loved so much.

Jessica Lange did an outstanding job of portraying Patsy, though she's far too attractive than Patsy ever was.  But it was the lip-syncing that was really irritating.  I know it's not easy to do, but Jessica Lange isn't even a singer, so she always looked like she was faking it to me.

Ed Harris as Charlie Dick was also outstanding.  He radiates charm and likeablity, and onscreen, he and Lange look like a real couple in love, yet unable to get along because of their insecurities.  They both get it right as a couple, allowing the audience to believe that they just can't keep away from each other.

In the end of the film(I'm sure everyone knows the story of how Patsy died by now) the plane crashes into a mountain creating a fireball that destroys everything.  In actuality, the pilot(rumored to be having an affair with Patsy) didn't listen and took the plane up in bad weather.  Since he was not instrument trained, he got turned upside down and excelerated  into the ground.  Bodies were found, and people were stealing pieces of the plane and the passengers things right afterwards.  Putting this in the movie would have made a more poignant ending.

The movie works because of Patsy's music, and the excellent acting and chemistry of Jessica Lange and Ed Harris.  With lesser actors, it might not be worth watching.",1357430400,4,2300,4.493975903614458

50280,5,0783114907,"""...instead of having sweet dreams about you.""  Jessica Lange stars as the unforgettable Patsy Cline in this very entertaining, rags-to-riches bio pic.  The story opens in the fifties, and Patsy is singing in small-time honky tonks in Virginia.  There, she meets charming Charlie Dick (Ed Harris) who woos her and they soon marry.  The marriage is rocky and intense, Patsy's career takes off,  and her songs go national.

Patsy's original recordings are heard throughout the movie and, if you're a fan, you'll absolutely love hearing them again.  Lange gives a very good performance as the spirited Patsy and was nominated for Best Actress, but for me, Ed Harris steals the show.  He plays Charlie as a rough and rowdy, uncouth but lovable man and is totally charismatic.  Look closely and spot a thin John Goodman in a small part.

Though the story is equal parts fact and fiction, it is very enjoyable with a fast-paced script and, most of all, Patsy's memorable songs.  Highly recommended.",1337126400,,992,4.951515151515151

50294,5,0783114907,"""Sweet Dreams"" and ""The Coal Miner's Daughter"" are the two best movies about female Country Music legends. It is only natural to compare them,particularly since they were actually close friends. I found it surprising that even though Patsy Cline was included in ""The Coal Miner's Daughter"";there was no appearance of Loretta Lynn in ""Sweet Dreams"".Beverly D'Angelo made a suprelative performance in portraying Patsy Cline and actually sang Patsy's songs. Jessica Lange also superalatively portrayed Patsy Cline but lip synked her songs and what we heard were onrginal recordings by Patsy herself.
 Both of these movies do an excellent job of showing the difficult ,though meteoric climb from obscurity to fame and legend. Both of these stars came from humble beginnings and like so many who reach the top in entertainment;it is not without great personal sacrifice to both themselves and their families.
 They provide great entertainment to all of us and for that we owe them much respect and owe them a great debt of gratitude.

But the music and 'general' story line captivated me.  I became a genuine Cline fanatic- and am still one to this day.  It's very likely I would have never heard of Patsy Cline if it weren't for this movie.  I wonder how many others could say the same?

I would recommend this film to anyone, but would caution them to view it for what it is- Hollywood entertainment 'based' on Patsy Cline's life.  It is by no means a documentary.",1299110400,,735,4.345588235294118
50301,3,0783114907,"I had recently watched (again) the story of Loretta Lynn in Coal Miners Daughter. As always I enjoyed the film very much.  Deciding it would make a great addition to my movie collection I bought it on Amazon. While purchasing it I noticed and decided to also buy Sweet Dreams which I saw is the story of Patsy Cline.  Patsy Cline had a small part in the Coal Miners Daughter and Loretta even went on to name one of her twins after Patsy.  They seemed to be close friends.  I love Patsy Cline!

While watching Sweet Dreams I could only hope that half of it was Hollywooded up.  Not to take away from Patsy's incredible talent and voice I just had no idea she had lived such a wild and crazy life; leaving what looked to be a husband that would have let her do anything to marry an abusive, cocky man which I held no good feelings for through the entire movie.  Anyway, knowing her tragic end, in the scene where she is telling her Mom she doesn't know what to do with her life I could only think that her life was about to be over so she never really had to figure it all out.  The movie is well acted but certainly took away the rose colored picture I had in my mind of the legend that is Patsy Cline.  I think I may try to find a biography on her to see how acurate this movie portrayed her and her life.  It left me wanting to know what happened to her children.  I don't really care what happened to Charlie but I do wonder about her first husband.

There is a lot of swearing (the GD word) and I wonder if she was really like that.  Any relationship with Loretta Lynn is not mentioned in this film.",1296432000,2,1602,4.112540192926045

50327,3,0783114907,"When Hilda Hensely (Patsy's mother) saw this movie she said, ""I saw it once.  That was enough for me.""
  Hollywood took all the dramatic liberties and artistic license it could in the making of this movie.  Jessica Lange's performance is one of her best but her watching her lip-synch while Cline's real voice was heard on the Soundtrack is distracting as their voices are entirely different. Lange tends to overdo it on the lip-syching and one can tell she is doing it.  Not good.  No disrespect to Lange but they should have hired an actress who could sing....like Sissy Spacek who sang all of Loretta Lynn's songs on ""Coal Miner's Daughter.""
  Ed Harris plays Charlie Dick well enough but is extremely unlikeable.  It is inacurrate at all counts to portray him as a wife-beater.  Sure, Patsy had Charlie arrested a couple of times but their relationship was NOT as volatile as portrayed here.  Ask any of Patsy's contemporaries who are still alive...they will corroborate this.
  Many inacurracies taken on this film.  Instead of making it ""Patsy and Charlie focused"" they should have done better by portraying Patsy's struggles to rise to fame in her career.....she went through a lot before she finally hit it big.  This is glossed over and given minute status in the film.
  The plane crash was over-dramatized and totally inacurrate.  It happened at night during a rainstorm....not during the day and the motor did not conk out prior to the crash!
  I would have like to have seen more interaction between Patsy and her siblings as well.  There was almost none except the car crash (also inaccurately depicted) with her brother and none with her sister Sylvia (a simple presentation of a gift for her high school graduation doesn't count).
  The best things about this film are:

1.  Ann Wedgeworth's portrayal of HIlda Hensley, Patsy's mother.  SHe is superb!!  SHe should have at least gotten an Oscar nomination for her portrayal.  She steals every scene she's in.

2.  The recreation of the Grand Ole OPry.

3.  The Music...the Soundtrack....great.

There is extreme profanity and sexual content in this film.  Definitely not for the kiddies!",1216771200,4,2153,4.921787709497207
50328,4,0783114907,"Before I saw ""Sweet Dreams,"" I knew that Patsy Cline had a string of country-pop hits like ""I Fall To Pieces"" and ""Crazy""; and I knew that she died in a tragic plane crash in 1963. After I saw this movie, I was hooked-- a Patsy Cline fan for life!
  This movie seems rather obviously inspired by the earlier success of Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn in ""Coal Miner's Daughter."" In ""Daughter,"" Beverly D'Angelo played Patsy Cline and sang her own vocals. As good as D'Angelo was, (she received an Oscar nomination) you won't miss her here. Jessica Lange gives a full-bodied performance. She is not required to sing. What actress, no matter how talented, could hope to match the incomparable emotion and sound of Patsy Cline's singing voice? Instead, Jessica Lange lip-sinc's to Patsy Cline's vocals-- to absolute perfection; in much the same manner as Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis lip-sinced to Judy Garland's legendary vocals in the superior 2001 TV biopic ""Me And My Shadows: Life With Judy Garland.""
  Karel Reisz's  1985  biopic is very selective about which aspects of Patsy's life are depicted. None of Patsy's friends, such as Loretta Lynn, are portrayed here. Spanning 1956-1963, the movie focuses firmly on Patsy's struggle to the top of the music  charts and her tumultuous, violent  marriage to Charlie Dick. Ed Harris matches Lange in intensity all the way as heavy drinking, hard partying Charlie. The film depicts Patsy and Charlie as living, loving, and fighting with a passion. Ann Wedgeworth gives a strong supporting performance as Hilda Hensley, Patsy's mother, and John Goodman (from ""Roseanne"" and Lange's TV version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"") appears as one of Charlie's drinking buddies.
  I love how  Jessica Lange portrays Patsy as a spirited,  vulnerable, but extremely vibrant woman who seldom takes ""stuff"" from anybody.  Like Sissy Spacek and Beverly D'Angelo before her, Jessica Lange received a much deserved Oscar nomination; and this is my favorite of Jessica Lange's movies and performances.  When Charlie first sees her, he says, ""Hey, I want you to get your coat, get in my car so we can get to know each other."" Patsy instantly responds, ""You want a lot, don't ya. Well, people in hell want ice water. That don't mean they get it!"" She describes Charlie to her mother as ""some clown with hot britches."" Encountering Charlie for the second time at a bar, shrewd Patsy sizes him up perfectly, saying she knows exactly what he wants in the backseat of his car.
  Much later, when Charlie lamely tries to explain why their house is a drunken mess, an exhausted Patsy (she has returned home from touring on the road) replies, ""Obviouly, you've got me confused with someone who gives a s##%%t.""
  Patsy says she wants it all, and the film takes the firm position that Patsy definitely deserved to have it all. As we watch the film, we root for Patsy to succeed in her music career, in life, and in love. Reality is, of course, much uglier than that.  Patsy may have wished for a house with yellow roses, but her life was definitely not a bed of roses. The worst thing about the script (traveling down an overly-familiar show-business biopic path) is that we see, or already know well, where it is going. The film may soften people and events, but it never completely sanitizes them for audience comfort.  Scenes of  drunken Charlie beating Patsy up,  and the plane crash that killed Patsy and three others, are harrowing to watch. However, our knowledge of the bittersweet facts of Patsy Cline's life gives the intense performances an undercurrent of heartbreaking sadness. You will never forget Patsy Cline's incredible voice  or Jessica Lange's  incredible performance.",1216252800,,3705,4.910112359550562

Even if you are not a big Patsy Cline fan, you will still be mesmerized by this story of her rise to fame.

Back in her day, you actually had to put more footwork into selling youself to the music industry, It wasn't like it is today. You didn't just get famous with a few phone calls and favors down the line. You actually had to have raw talent, the thing so many singers are lacking today, and boy did she have it !!!

Of course, through this movie, it is Patsy's true voice with Jessica Lange lip synching to it. I just love her crystal clear voice. Especially in ""Sweet Dreams"",  ""Crazy"" and "" I fall to Pieces"". We also get to hear ""Walkin after Midnight"" as well as many other favorites.

Her story is pretty intriguing, too. Of her rise to fame, her marriage, her children, and then her sad plane crash.

50349,3,0783114907,"It's just a waste of time to quibble about the minor boosts given to dramatization at the expense of absolute accuracy regarding this film. (The most notable fact being that Cline looked much more like Bette Midler than Jessica Lange.)

But the point was never about how she mistakenly married a wife-beating weasel or what she said just before she made a big smudge on a mountain somewhere. (By the way, why was there a ""benefit for a disc jockey"" that Cline's ill-fated plane had to go to, anyway? Didn't DJ's make enough big money even back then?) But all that matters is that this movie points new fans to the incredible sound stylings of Cline herself.

And the producers thankfully opted to keep only Cline's original tunes in this one, instead of putting Lange through some forced vocal training to imitate her. Cline could never be completely imitated anyway, and decades later we can see that her quality still endures. Sure, we'll never forget other swingin' young '50s and early '60s country and/or pop stars, like Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Bobby Darrin. And Patsy was one of 'em too!

Maybe one other point does need restating anyway, at the risk of being too obvious - hey, entertainers - whenever possible, stay the heck out of airplanes! If your career demands that you always get flown to your gigs instead of driven, then it's going way too fast. Nobody should be in that much of a hurry. You've got decades of a very rich life ahead of you - don't blow it all on a fiery crash in some crazy contraption invented by those nutty Wright brothers.

50350,3,0783114907,"Hollywood made it: embellished, out of context and sometimes very inaccurate. Ask anyone who knew Patsy Cline or read Ellis Nassour's 1993 bestseller, ""Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline"" and you'll see a much more beloved, complex Patsy Cline than what director Karel Reisz offers here. Filmed in 1985 in Virginia and Nashville, the main focus of the film is on Cline's second marriage to the love of her life, Charlie Dick, the father of her beloved children. It begins with their meeting and takes you on a short journey of how her career mixed with their marriage. All in all, the film, based on the extensive research I've done, is probably 40% accurate and her family and friends seem all but supportive of the film's story. Instead of showing the triumphant side of Cline - the woman who fought from an early age to leave her humble beginnings and realize her dream as a singer (and would become one of the best voices of all time) - it focuses on all of the tragedy of her life. But you know, trash sells. ""Sweet Dreams"" wasn't the box office smash it could have been. Jessica Lange's performance was well deserving of the Academy Award nomination that she recieved (she claims that the role of Patsy Cline was her favorite ever), although NOBODY could imitate someone as gifted and complex as Patsy Cline. It's worth a watch if you're a true Patsy Cline fan, but do yourself a favor and read Ellis Nassour's book, ""Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline"" or buy the DVD documentary ""Remembering Patsy"". ""Sweet Dreams"" only scrapes the surface of the woman she was. In Nassour's book and the DVD documentary, you'll see a side to Patsy Cline that even Hollywood could never portray. They tried. And failed.",1102118400,4,1744,4.684039087947883

She captures the spirit and spunk of Patsy, and Ed Harris does a good job as Charlie Dick, Patsy's less than cordial husband. I can't believe people actually think Beverly D'Angelo was a better Patsy Cline in Coal Miner's Daughter.  She didn't even come close. I also am glad that Lange did not use her own voice, but on perhaps a few hidden tracks in film. This is because this film has converted many into liking Patsy Cline because all her original vocals are on here. People who can't stand Country Music have drawn to her music through this medium. So I have to say all in all its a good film.",1096848000,5,876,4.27710843373494
50352,4,0783114907,"Why haven't I seen or heard of this film before now?  I am a big fan of Jessica Lange.  Anyway, perhaps i was too young to be interested in the storyline when it was first shown in cinemas in 1985.

Sweet Dreams is the story of Patsy Cline, or should I say about her relationship with husband (Ed Harris) which dominates most of the film.  Many have questioned the authenticity of the relationship displayed in the film, claiming it to be one-sided.  Who knows for sure.  What I can tell you is that Jessica Lange is outstanding in her role (although I did miss her blonde hair).

Jessica lip-synchs during the singing scenes, and does this quite well (except for the odd occassion).

SWEET DREAMS is a very watchable movie that is better than I expected.  I thought the reason I hadn't heard of it before was because it might have been a bad film.

DVD SUMMARY:  My summary of the DVD is based on the Australian release.  While it should gets 5 stars for its anamorphic widescreen transfer, the transfer is not sharp, often quite bland.  However, near the end of the film the transfer starts to get sharper.  No extras at all on the DVD, not even a trailer.  Also noted is that the chapter selection does not work.  Aside from these issues, the DVD is worth owning or seeing for Jessica Lange's fine performance alone.",1091318400,4,1319,4.4789915966386555

50364,5,0783114907,"The beauty of this film, accurate or not, lies in the love story at its core and Jessica Lange's unforgettable portrayal of Patsy Cline as an ideal character. Lange's Patsy Cline is a human being who loves so much that she is willing to stay with an abusive husband. Her heart was so big and yet in her lifetime she was hurt so much. The heart of this movie lies in its belief in the ideal, and there are people out there who love much more than others, unconditionally, and sadly many times they pay in heartache for the flaws in those they love.
Whether the character in the film is the real Patsy Cline or not, it is a sincere and unforgettable portrayal by Jessica Lange, and that Patsy was a romantic is something that most of her fans want to believe. Sweet Dreams is a glorious film that will have you thinking back to it and contrasting the themes to those in your life long after it is finished, much like Jessica Lange's Frances.  Somehow, Lange always manages to convey true inner beauty, which is what you will find in this film. What we can learn from this film is that if we are ever lucky enough to find someone in our life who can love so fully and unconditionally, we must never take them for granted.",1073952000,2,1218,4.318777292576419

50366,4,0783114907,"Reality is generally more complicated than any motion picture can possibly convey--and such is the case with SWEET DREAMS, the 1985 bio-pic of singer Patsy Cline, which ran into a firestorm of criticism at the time of its release.  For Patsy Cline was not a figure from the remote past.  She and her life were extremely well recalled by family, friends, and co-workers, and one and all attacked the film as an extremely inaccurate portrait of her, her husband Charlie, and her life and career.
To a certain extent, the validity of these complaints about the film are a matter of opinion.  But it does seem likely that the script softened Cline's harder edges and over-emphasized the stormy nature of her marriage in order to cast her in the role of victim.  What isn't opinion is the way the film treats her career: it didn't happen like that, and while the film presents her as a great star at the time of her death in truth she had released only a handful of widely distributed records by 1963--and while some of them were big hits, they weren't quite as big as you might think.  Even the celebrated ""Sweet Dreams"" never made it to the top spot on any music chart, and it was not until well after her death that she received full recognition for her remarkable work.
So instead of truth, or even a good approximation of it, SWEET DREAMS gives us the legend, the folk tale of the rough-and-tumble girl with the big, emotional voice who came from no where, married an abusive husband, and leaped into stardom that was cut short by an untimely death.  And as legend, the film works very well.
The weak point of the film is the script, which plays largely to a ""domestic drama"" aspect and tends to smooth out the characters in a ""santized for your protection"" sort of way.  The direction and cinematography are no great shakes either, and ultimately SWEET DREAMS looks very much like a made-for-television movie.  But the cast carries it off in fine style.  Jessica Lang looks no more like Patsy Cline than I do, and her lip-scynchs to Cline's work is rather hit-and-miss, but she gives a truly memorable performance; Ed Harris equals her in the role of husband Charlie, and together they create a synergy that has tremendous power.  The supporting cast is also quite good, with Ann Wedgeworth a standout in the role of Cline's mother Hilda.
And then there is that soundtrack.  Even if you've heard all these songs a thousand times, they're still worth hearing again.  Patsy Cline was truly an amazing artist.  But the film does something odd with them: the bulk of the story is set during the 1950s, but there is not a 1950s-era Cline vocal to be heard in the entire film, everything is taken from her glory years at MCA between 1960 and 1963.  And very often it seemed to me that the original scoring of Cline's songs had been replaced with new arrangements.
And that, ultimately, is rather typical of the film as a whole.  Just a little change here, just a little inaccuracy there, and while they all seem slight individually, they add up to a fairly significant distortion collectively.  The performances make it worth watching, and they bring it in at a solid four stars.  But if you're expecting anything more than the glossy legend of Patsy Cline, you won't find it here.

(Even if you aren't a fan, I defy you not too be moved by the voice.)
Patsy Cline broke a lot of rules and opened a lot of doors for many female country singers ( Dottie West, Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette to name a few ).
 Strong performances by both leads and the supporting cast keep the film flowing well.
 If you can forgive the few inaccuries and fabrications (The re-creation of Patsy's last moments and minor details of her personal life) you will enjoy this inspiring rags-to-riches story.",1017014400,2,571,4.643564356435643

50369,5,0783114907,"This movie, featuring great performances by Jessica Lange as Patsy Cline, and Ed Harris as Charley Dick, Cline's husband, chronicles the life and times of Patsy Cline, her rise to stardom, and her all too brief hold on it.

Jessica Lange gives a wonderful, believable performance as Patsy Cline. Ed Harris, as her hard drinking, womanizing, and ultimately abusive husband, plays his role to perfection. John Goodman has a small role in the film as Charley Dick's good ol' boy, meat head friend.

The movie shows how this poorly educated, young woman with a throaty and achingly rich voice went on to become one of the greatest crossover talents ever to come out of Nashville. Her flame burned brightly for several years, until it was extinguished when a plane in which she was a passenger crashed headlong into a mountain.

Her music runs throughout the entire film. If you are not a Patsy Cline fan when you first sit down to view this film, then you surely will be by the time you finish doing so. No one sang with more feeling than Patsy Cline, and she evidently lived her life the same way. This is a terrific movie and well worth watching!",981158400,73,1144,4.625615763546798
50370,4,0783114907,"I just saw this and was impressed with Jessica Lange's controlled performance as Patsy Cline. Her work here is one of the best I've seen from her in a long while, but the weak supporting cast do nothing to help her out. Ed Harris is thoroughly wasted in a role that is both badly written and executed.
Jessica Lange seems to do well in biographical roles, and as Cline she is thoroughly convincing. The only sore points in the film are the climax (the scene where Lange boards a plane and plunges to her death came too quickly and got over too fast) and the fact that Lange's doesn't lip-sync very well. I couldn't believe that it was she who was singing those songs, even if it wasn't really her, of course. On the other hand, the dialogue is good and the direction is great. Certainly worth watching. I am told that Jessica Lange was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this film in 1986. She didn't win.",980640000,3,909,4.384615384615385

50372,3,0783114907,"Patsyfans are gonna buy this no matter what... But it coulda been better. Everything about this production says ""TV Movie""...except for the movie-level stars - Ed Harris and Jessica Lange. There's a lack of  chemistry between them, and Lange, 36 years old when this film was made, is  too old and worn to portray the young Patsy. In some scenes where Patsy has  shorter curly black hair she looks like Chita Rivera!! Important details  about her life are glossed over, abstracted, or downright fabricated. Was  it necessary to recreate what happened on board the plane during its last  moments? Did Patsy really cry out ""Charlie"" moments before the  crash? Showing something like this is so tabloid, and not as artfully  depicted as in Coal Miner's Daughter.  It only makes you wonder what she  really cried. (""Awwww Sheeeiittt!!"" was probably more like it)  Didn't the plane go down on a hill, and not smack dab into a stone mountain  face that looks like future expansion for Mt. Rushmore?  Didn't Patsy's car  crash head on into another car , not get blind-sided by a big truck?  Did  Charlie really drag Patsy out in the middle of the night to dance in the  rain in front of the bar where they first met? Very little emphasis is  given to the mechanics of Patsy's rise to the top, which was handled so  well in ""Coal Miner's Daughter"". Patsy is seen cooking as much as  singing..Her career is treated as some sort of factory job to provide a  background to fights with her husband. We never get much of a sense of life  on the road, or Patsy's legendary interaction with audiences. It's strange  watching her sit in a broken down house wearing a bathrobe, smoking a  cigarette, and talking about her hit records.. And at the end, there was no  epilogue saying what happened to her children..did her husband ever  remarry. Even ""American Graffitti"" provided an epilogue, and  those characters weren't even real.  Typical of the way this film's lack of  artistry is one scene where a Buddy Holly song is playing in the background  unrelated to the action other than just being background music. Was the  irony lost on somebody somewhere? If it wasn't, did someone think that  throwing one of his songs onto the soundtrack would provide some dramatic  effect all on its own?  Think of how powerful one strategically placed  Buddy Holly song could have been in this film.  You didn't have to know who  Loretta Lynn was to enjoy Coal Miner's Daughter...but you have to be a very  devoted Patsyfan to get anything out of this film.  Patsy deserved better  than this.",935798400,3,2564,4.712669683257919
