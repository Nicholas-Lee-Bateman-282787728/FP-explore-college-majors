3594018,5,B001G0MFJM,"I first started watching NCIS somewhere in Season 2.  I liked that much that I now have the complete 5 seasons and cannot wait until season 6 is released.  Even my wife who does not watch TV that much keeps on reminding me when NCIS is showing on TV.  It has to be one of the best shows around.  Come on guys push for Season 6 to be transferred to Disc

3594020,5,B001G0MFJM,"I think this TV show NCIS is the best thing on TV. It has been along time that a TV show has caught my eyes ""WOW"". I normaly do not watch any TV. But this show is GREAT Super HOT,HOT>>>>. I started watching this show, and i find myself wanting more and more of NCIS. Thank you very much. By the way ""Go Gibbs & your wonderful NCIS team,stop them ALL Gibbs from comitting any more crimes & lies.....out there.....",1228608000,2,412,4.1625
3594021,5,B001G0MFJM,I was a fan of Jag and now the NCIS being a spin off of Jag it's got to be great.  I thing it is very down to earth and relaxing.  The team works as one like they are supposed to do.  They may have family's away from NCIS but this is also their family.,1224979200,2,252,3.5454545454545454
3594022,5,B001G0MFJM,"This show is the show of all shows. It is very well written and the actors are perfect. Nobody could ever replace Mark Harmon who is one of the finest actors of all times, not to mention, good looking. He is a natural born actor and makes NCIS. I also like the team. Tony, Ziva, Tim, Abby, Doctor Mallard and Palmer are not replaceable in my eyes. The writers of the show should be really proud of themselves for their creative thinking and how they put the show together. I hope this show stays on for many years to come. I bought all of the tapes for every season and always watch the show either on TV or my tapes. I think I have ""Gibbs fever""...Bettye Clark",1312848000,,661,4.21259842519685

3594032,1,B001G0MFJM,"Well I have previously written a very good review at the urging of the seller.  I did not mind doing so as I had received the product as promised.  Little did I know that they were not usable.  The first season was great, not a single problem.... the second season was good as well, there seemed to be a couple of minor glitches in a few disks, heck just thought it was my DVD player.  Then the big problems came, of course I had the disks for a few weeks by then, but I contact the seller, and let him know what was going on.  He did not respond for a couple of weeks and I emailed a rather nasty email, and he suddenly responded, with apologies and words of correcting the problem.  The problem is that seasons, 3, 4, 5 are unusable.  I have not checked season 6 yet, as I wished to watch them in a row.  The seller asked for my address and I sent it the next day, that has been another couple of weeks ago.  So I paid over a hundred dollars for 2 seasons of NCIS.  Not to mention the fact that I have now ordered season 3, and 4 all over again from other Amazon sellers.  I just checked season 5 tonight and was able to watch almost one whole disc while the others are not even loading.  Again I checked my DVD player, cleaned it well even before cleaning it I tried another DVD.  No problem with the DVD player.  I guess I will just have to order season 5 and probably 6 from another dealer.  Just do not want this to happen to anyone else.  Really did attempt to get this situation worked out with the seller.  Anyway... just be wary of what you are purchasing through him.",1288569600,3,1578,4.087947882736156

3594034,1,B001G0MFJM,I have never been so totally ripped off before. The DVD's were supposed to be new. They were junk. Most of them wouldn't play at all. Some crackjed as they were being removed from the case. The case looked new but was an obvious Knock-off. The real NCIS DVD's come in a totally different case.

3594036,5,B001G0MFJM,"NCIS, the crime thriller, has been around for 7 seasons!!! That alone should tell you how great it is!

3594050,5,B001G0MFJM,"My fiance and I have not watched too many other CSI type shows together since she really didn't like or get into them. The very first time we watched NCIS together we were both 100% hooked. The last seriers we watch from start to finish was Friends and we thought that was going to be hard to beat. We are definetly now die hard NCIS Fans. The charters are all top notch and we continually dispute who is our favorite because they are all just that good! We also enjoy the different episodes as they continue to find unique situations every week. I totally recommend buying the series on DVD versus trying to watch it weekly, even if you have it recorded. There is nothing better then watching it un-interrupted from season 1 on. By far the best ever series the movie / TV industry has ever put out. (of course our opinion!)",1276732800,,824,4.392156862745098

Another concern I had was the quality of recordings but after watching all the cds I didn't find any errors of any kind.  I agree with the reviewer that there are breaks in each show but these I attribute to commercial breaks for broadcasting.  Not a problem.

3594069,5,B001G0MFJM,"NCIS has been one of the leading network TV shows for the last few seasons.  With its colorful cast and fascinating story lines, NCIS proves to be ""more addicting than pistachios."" NCIS is based out of Washington, DC but the crimes that they investigate take them all over the country and even the world.

 The characters that make up the NCIS team are truly what make the show. The team is made up primarily of 6 main characters. The team leader, Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, is an ex-marine gunnery sergeant who proves to be a brilliant investigator whose gut is famous.  Under him are his three agents Special Agents DiNozzo, McGee, and Todd (seasons 1+2) or David (seasons 3-7). Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo is the senior field agent and never lets anyone forget it. His personality is best compared to that of an overgrown frat boy. Despite his immaturity, Tony brings his experience working with the Baltimore Police Department adding great experience to the team. The third member of the team is Special Agent Timothy McGee, aka Probie. McGee joined the team half way through the first season bringing with him a MIT education in computer sciences that he uses to track criminals and access pretty much any information that was ever digitalized, if it's out there McGee will find it. He takes flack from Tony for being a geek, often to the point of calling him McGeek, but McGee doesn't let it get him down. The team of special agents can be rounded out by the only female on the team. In seasons one and two this position is filled by Kate Todd, an ex-secret service agent who joins the team in season one after being fired from the Secret Service for helping agents Gibbs and DiNozzo get the body of a dead marine off Air Force One. She is a feisty agent who is always trying to to prove to Tony that she can do anything just as well as any man. Kate takes her job very seriously and this ends up saving Agent Gibbs life, but costing her her own at the end of season two. After Kate's death this position is filled by Mossad Liaison Officer Ziva David. Ziva is a trained assassin from Israel who has issues avoiding using force to get the answers she wants. While this rounds out the team of agents their support staff is just as important and even more colorful.

 They are supported by Medical Examiner Dr. Donald Mallard, Ducky and Forensic Scientist Abby Scuito. Ducky is an older gentleman from Scotland who has seen everything and is not afraid to let anyone know. Every case reminds him of something that he has seen before and the story of that situation precedes every briefing Gibbs receives, whether he wants to hear it or not. Ducky is known for his expertise in allowing the dead to tell their stories. He is a proper gentleman and is always sporting a bow tie, except the one time that he was seeing a younger woman and traded the bow tie for a younger looking neck tie for a few weeks. Upstairs from Ducky's autopsy is Abby. Abby is an amazing forensic scientist who never allows anything to go unprocessed and will do it all double time as soon as Gibbs asks. Abby's blood must be type caffeine as she lives off a highly caffeinated drink called caf-pow, which Gibbs brings her every time he needs answers. Abby is one of the happiest people you will ever find yet she has a very extreme sense of style and living. Abby dresses very gothic and even sleeps in a coffin. She is fascinated by death yet so warm and caring. Tony describes Abby as ""a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron smothered in contradictions in terms."" She shares wonderful relationships with all the members of the team, particularly Gibbs who is very protective of Abby and seems to see her as a daughter figure. Between these two any evidence that exists will be found and linked to anything and everything it can be to catch the criminals.

  These six team members always seem to be able to figure out what happened and who is responsible. The rimes that are depicted can often be very troubling and even gruesome at times and watchers of NCIS should be cautions but that should not stop a mature viewer from at least giving NCIS a chance. While NCIS may seem like just another crime show, the characters truly set it far above any other show out there.",1269475200,11,4252,4.533246414602347
3594070,5,B001G0MFJM,"This series is quite excellent, however some of the plot lines are definitely less than inspiring in latter seasons and I can see why Harmon and Bellisario had their recent disagreement followed by Bellisario taking a step back to keep Harmon aboard.

* Season 5 Spoilers Below, you have been warned *

In season 5 I had some definite problems with how Jenny's character changed from a reasonable woman and intelligent Director to an obsessed woman who wasn't willing to acknowledge or adapt to newly revealed information as far as Rene Benoit was concerned which made her much less effective as a Director - the excessive focus on that plot arc soured me on the character as well as giving me some doubts about Tony who was also involved.

She created trust issues between Gibbs and his team as well as put her own judgment into question with a series of bad decisions that didn't really make a hell of a lot of sense with the information that she would have had available to her - I had liked her previously and I think the writers had a distinct failure to keep within the established character in what I consider to be a failed plot arc.

There were simply too many loose details with too many unreasonable actions attributed to her and caused as a result of the plot line and it turned me off of the show somewhat - its taken me weeks to get through season 5 when I devoured season 1-4 in days. I haven't watched season 6+ as of yet, however I'm certain now that it has been resolved it will return to the quality I expected and enjoyed beforehand.

I wish that they had resolved the situation about Jenny's father with some credibility - it was obvious he's alive up to the point I've seen (that may change with more information later; I'm not sure) as fingerprints that weren't damn recent wouldn't be around after the amount of time he was supposed to be dead on a bottle of whiskey.

Overall, I heartily recommend this show other than the plot issues mentioned. Vance also becomes an issue later on from what I understand and breaks up the team for a while with no real reason for doing so other than to cause some sort of trouble - I haven't seen it yet, but the interplay of the team is what makes the show so great compared to CSI or Law and Order (both of which I'm not terribly fond of).",1268438400,3,2301,4.402352941176471

HOWEVER, if you add up the current prices of the individual seasons, it will cost you about $20 LESS than if you buy this set at $180. I know Amazon is listing this as a savings but not at current prices. So buy the individual seasons and get them for about $161 (that's seasons 1-6), and dive in! I can't get enough of this show, but even I like to save a little when I can. So, because of price I would give this 4 Stars.

I researched the UPC and found several do not match true items. I would like to return all 6 seasons for a full refund because these are not new items. I would like directions on what must be done to correct this situation. Any help you can give me in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

3594095,3,B001G0MFJM,"I've enjoyed this series since it was doing reruns the first summer it aired.  It's a great show and the characters are entertaining, individualistic, and just down right likeable.  However, in the last two seasons I've found that there is that special something missing.  No, it's not Jen Shepards character either.  I was rather glad to see her go.  This new dude, Leon, is much better and seems like he has a handle on things where her character was all over the board and not believeable in that kind of position.  I'm a women and women in those kinds of directorial rolls, yeah, not so much.  Anyway, I've noticed something is just missing since the writers strike.  There's something off with the characters.  I watch shows from the first 4 seasons and it's there, but once 5 and 6 hit, it's almost totally lacking.  I wish they'd get that back.  Don't know if certain writers aren't there anymore or that, because of the strike and the break they had the writers lost their mojo..?  It's disappointing but, I still watch the show.  Even though they're more blasie and never really leave me going WOW!!  like the first 4 seasons.  The only head knocker about the 6th season was the finale, the very end with Ziva tied up, beaten and, in general, not looking so hot.

The same thing happened to CSI: MIAMI.  Great first few seasons and then...they changed the format or something.  It became iffy, at best.

Oh well, here's hoping for next season.  Now I saw they're going to have an NCIS: LA..jezz people, come up with some new ideas already!  They had that pilot in with the original NCIS and I wasn't impressed with the characters or the idea (even though I like LL Cool J and Chris ODonnel)...once again, not so much.  Recylced ideas, how's that original??",1243296000,7,1765,4.607717041800643

I wanted to see the episodes from the beginning to get the time line of events, so I ordered the first five seasons and am now waiting for the sixth to be released. I am so hooked on this show that I hope it never ends. The dynamics between the characters is what makes this show so special. I love Tony, I wish he and Ms. David would hook up. I was sad when Kate was killed. Abby is a hoot. McGee reminds me of a sweet puppy. I think the show is held together because of the boss, Gibbs. Let us just face it, they are all wonderful. I am surprised it took me 5 years to hear about the show. My sister told me that if I would watch it I would never watch anything else. She was right. I love that the USA Station has back to back episodes on every day. Some of the shows I have seen 2 or 3 times and still love them.",1242604800,2,944,3.748743718592965

I started watching this show only recently and became so addicted that I bought all of the seasons on dvd.  My husband, in-laws and brother-in-law are all now addicted to it as well.  I can't wait for this season to be released on dvd and for the next season to start!  I usually don't watch tv shows during the season, I typically wait until the season is over and the dvd's are released, but I just haven't been able to wait for season 6, I've actually been watching it on tv (and then on my laptop while at work!!)

The cast works so well together.  The dynamics of the the characters - the best I've seen since Firefly.  The way they love each other as a family, look out for each other, rip on each other, joke around, work so flawlessly.  This is by far the BEST crime show procedural I've ever seen.  It's actually very believable.  I mean, besides having to solve a crime in such a short time frame.

The music is great, the camera angles, the editing, the everything.  This show is amazing!  I hope it stays on for as LONG as it can.  It's gained 5 new viewers this season alone.

My thanks goes out to the cast and crew for the superb job done on this television show.",1241049600,27,1249,4.251063829787234
