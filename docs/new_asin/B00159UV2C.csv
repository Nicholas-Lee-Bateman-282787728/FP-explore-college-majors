8257919,5,B00159UV2C,"Ten Tigers from Kwantung-also stars Ku Feng, Fu Sheng, Lu Feng, Sun Chien, Lo Meng, Chiang Sheng, and many more Shaw Brothers stars. Ming Dynasty heroes hide a rebel leader to help him continue his fight against the Qin Dynasty. Fights begin as misunderstandings between two groups of loyal Ming followers, who are eventually united for their cause. A subplot about these exploits begins as  the ""Tiger's"" students share the story through flashbacks following the murder of a comrade. Chin Siu Ho plays one of these students, whose fighting skills are also showcased in Jet Li's Fist of Legend.
Duel of the Iron Fist-another Ti Lung & David Chiang collaboration directed by Chang Cheh. Story revolves aroung Ren Jia, a gang member whose Godfather is murdered, is ostracized, and seeks revenge for the Godfather's death. He teams us reluctantly with the Rover, to get his retribution for the heinous death. Also features Ku Feng and Yu Hui.
The Blood Brothers-David Chiang & Chen Kuan-tai are highwaymen who meet Ti Lung on the road, attempt to rob him, and end up joining Ti Lung creating a large gang of conscripted men. Ti-Lung plays a cad who uses others to further his career and status. In addition, he secretly has an affair with the wife of one of his blood brothers. Therefore, he will do everything to retain his power. Ti Lung won an asian actors award for this movie.
Seven Soldiers of Kung Fu-aka All Men are Brothers follows the Liang Shan heroes of the 12th century. This story follows on the heels of the Water Margin. David Chiang, Chen Kuan-tai, Wang Chung, Wang Kuang, et al are spies who help determine the best plan to attack Guangzhou, a seemingly impenetrable fortress, to capture Emperor Fang. The heores unite to accomplish the impossible.

These are some highly-featured works of Ti Lung. Another recommendation for fans of the Water Margin is Delightful Forest, a story about Wu Sung explaining his eventual disguise as a monk (although not how he joined the Liang Shan bandits). Anyone new to the Shaw Brothers movies of late 1960s to 1980s would enjoy this set, and I gave this collection 5 stars.

The collection is completely dubbed into English, also is displayed in 16:9 ratio. It contains some previews for other Shaw Brothers titles. Videos are clear and clean having been digitally remastered. Good value for four titles.",1323302400,2,2356,4.870324189526184
8257920,5,B00159UV2C,"One of the great values of all time: four classic Shaw Brothers martial arts dramas from the golden age of Wuxia, all directed by the master of the Kung Fu film, Chang Cheh, and starring the one of the greatest stars of 1970s Asian cinema, Ti Lung. Three of the films also star Ti's frequent screen partner, the great David Chiang. (Throw in some Alexander Fu Sheng and The Venoms for good measure.) These are the beautifully restored Celestial editions. A must-own set for any serious fan of classic martial arts movies. The only downside: these are all English dubs with no other langange options.",1256774400,4,599,4.714285714285714
