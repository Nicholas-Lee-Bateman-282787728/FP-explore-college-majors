8363910,4,B001NFNQWU,"Lots of fun Gamera footage, great old skool special effects, and some odd ""boardroom"" footage with 10 - 15 white guys sitting around a table endlessly discussing how they're going to deal with Gamera.",1396742400,,200,4.911764705882353
8363911,3,B001NFNQWU,"A flight of Soviet bombers ""accidentally"" flies over Alaska.  U.S. interceptors shoot one of the planes down, causing a low-yield nuclear explosion.  The nuclear explosion wakes a giant prehistoric turtle called Gammera by the local Inuit.  Gammera attacks a model ship, flaming it with bad breath for good measure.  Fortunately, the crew abandoned ship just in time.  What excitement!  Did I tell you that this turtle is so cool that it walks on two legs?  Clever trick for a turtle.

This movie digresses for a while as Gammera is walking or flying in parts unknown.  Various characters, including Brian Donlevy as General Terry Arnold and Albert Dekker as the Secretary of Defense, debate the existence of Gammera.  This movie is relatively early in the monster genre because, as any self-respecting scientist of today knows, giant monsters exist and they are nearly all genetically programmed to attack Japan for reasons that scientists have yet to discover.  Eventually the scientists and authorities bow to the overwhelming scientific evidence (footprints, sketches by small boys, anonymous phone calls, possibly including one from Kolchak, the Night Stalker) and recognize something must be done about this giant menace!

Gammera rescues a small boy (bless the monster's heart) before going off and frying a bunch of people in a Tokyo apartment building (this is one quirky turtle).  To prepare for toasting Tokyo, Gammera destroys a geothermal plant and chows down on the flames.  I guess Gammera likes hot food.  Somewhere around this point in the movie a scientist establishes that (drum roll) Gammera is not like other creatures!

The excitement builds as Gammera lands at a totally cool model airport and then begins to stomp around an excellent model of Tokyo.  We catch a bit of a song titled ""Gammera"" that sounds suspiciously (to me) like the theme from the 1960s television series ""Batman.""  It could be coincidence, or not.

Of course there has to be a plan to deal with Gammera, since all attempts to stop him have failed.  Enter Plan Z!  Before Plan Z we see model trains and a model laboratory and more models of other stuff, and then we see the Plan Z model.  Woo hoo!  This stuff is great!  Of course, I have to leave the suspense of Plan Z to the viewer to discover.

After the success of Toho studios with ""Godzilla,"" other Japanese studios attempted to capitalize on the monster fad.  Modern audiences will find this attempt at giant monster horror more humorous than scary given today's sophisticated special effects.  However, the models in the movie are excellent, and the laughs this movie generates for adults is worth a watch (or in my case, several watches).  Young children, on the other hand, may find this movie frightening (I know I did way back in the 60s), so just because you may not find the movie frightening, do not assume the little ones will not.

This movie comes in several title flavors.  There is ""Gamera,"" ""Giant Monster Gamera,"" ""Gammera the Invincible,"" and ""Gamera:  The Giant Monster.""  One or two titles are for the original production, one title is for the first U.S. release, and one title is for a re-release.

They just do not make movies like this any more.  Thank goodness for that!

Enjoy!",1339891200,,3251,4.913602941176471
