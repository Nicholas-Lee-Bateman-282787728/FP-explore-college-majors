1420679,2,B00005B2Z3,"""Crazy Horse and Custer--The Untold Story"" is actually a repackaging of the pilot and first few episodes of the 1966(?) ABC-TV series, ""Custer,"" starring Wayne Mauder, Slim Pickens, and a bunch of other first-rate and quickly-recognized character actors.
ABC thought it was on to something: let's take a time-honored TV form (the western) but give ""the kids"" someone they can relate to--a rebellious, long-haired action hero.  Thus, the idea to base a series on Lt. Colonel (nee General) George Armstrong Custer was born.  On paper, it looked like a great idea; Custer had for many years been revered as a great Civil War general (which he was) and effective Indian fighter (which he wasn't) who died, ""tragically,"" at Little Big Horn.
Alas, by the time the series hit the air, Custer wasn't such a hero.  Rather, he became a symbol for the terrible treatment of Native Americans.  Also, he was being seen less as a lovable rebel and more as a megalomaniacal officer who effectively murdered the entire 7th Calvary with his recklessness at Little Big Horn.  Richard Mulligan's portrayal in ""Little Big Man"" was probably only slightly exaggerated.
All that having been said, the show had promise...a lot of stock western kind of action, but with a slight edge.  Relatively accurate historically, too, as far as character names and such.  Many liberties are taken, however, in the name of ""good TV.""  The biggest drawback, as one reviewer noted, is the really poor quality of the print used.  I've seen older TV shows with better footage.
The series didn't run that long.  Personally, I wouldn't mind a DVD release of all the shows, with upgraded prints.  In the meantime, we have to settle for this.",1057190400,3,1698,4.922807017543859
1420680,1,B00005B2Z3,"Thinking this was some obscure italian western I might enjoy,WRONG.Crazy Horse & Custer, turns out to be some old T.V.film from somewhere,Made in the U.S.A. The film is interesting in a strange sort of way but let down by a really lousy transfer.

7936506,4,B00005B2Z3,Not the best quality.  Not HD but better than nothing.  Takes me back a long time.  1967 or so.  But arrived in good shape and in a timely manner.,1416787200,,146,3.9310344827586206
7936507,2,B00005B2Z3,"Not meant to be accurate, but a nice old cowboy and indian story.
When I saw 2001 on the DVD, I thought it might include ideas and facts from Stephen Ambrose book.
Too bad for me.",1241308800,,179,4.0

7936509,4,B00005B2Z3,"A decent Western, Crazy Horse and Custer, brings to the screen the story of the well known Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, one of the most controversial American historical figures of all time.  Hero or Villain?  Well that's easy; neither and both, since one's hero is another's villain, case closed. And speaking of, this is a pro-Custer approach.

The cast carry out their performances well enough, (though ""Late Sixties"" is written all over it...) the only exception being the general who is not that convincing in his role.

The dialogues could have been better too.

Nevertheless, the plot, the setting, the battles and the costumes are all above average.

Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!

For wonderful Westerns I would strongly recommend The Outlaw Josey Wales, Major Dundee and The Undefeated.",1143849600,4,905,5.157534246575342
7936510,2,B00005B2Z3,"is probably wrong.  Including this movie.

This ""movie"" from the 1967 ABC series ""Custer"" is just plain wrong in everything. Poorly produced, Indians all wrong even when the series was trying to make them sympathetic.  Custer as a single man, no mention of family (which was the core of his life) because that would have been too restraining for the TV show.

I gave it a 2 as a curiousity of the time.

And FYI it's Wayne MauNder.  Who went on to another tv western then disappeared.  I believe he was a record producer into the 90's.",1134604800,,535,4.453608247422681
7936511,2,B00005B2Z3,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI release of this film.
Pulled from the 17 episode ABC series from 1967, ""Crazy Horse and Custer: The Untold Story"" is a pleasing way to spend 90 minutes if you're a fan of the western genre. We've all heard the story about the battle of the Little Big Horn, but this movie introduces us to the main characters of that battle long before that ill fated meeting. It shows how Lt. Col. George Custer took a rag tag bunch of soldiers and made them into the fine Seventh Cavalry unit they were. It also takes the viewer to the first meeting between Custer and Crazy Horse and how they had to be allies if they were to live to meet later.
Starring Wayne Mauder (who?) with Slim Pickens (under utilized) and Michael Dante as Crazy Horse, the cast features Mary Ann Mobley and the venerable Robert F. Simon.
The print featured in this release was bought by a company called Liberty Entertainment who put a title on in the beginning and end and chopped out any reference to 20th Century Fox who originally produced it. The print itself looked like it had been bicycled around and the opening credits just might make you seasick from the motion. The color is fair and once you get into the film the print is not too scratched. Not bad for the price you pay.
This movie besides being available individually is also in a 10 pack called ""The Wild West"". For about triple the price of this, you can get 10 pretty decent westerns. You can view this item on Amazon.com ....",1079049600,9,1532,4.41696113074205
7936512,5,B00005B2Z3,"I give this a 5 star rating for several reasons.  The main one being that my Uncle is a co-star in this movie.  He plays Captain Keogh.  His real name is Grant Woods.  This movie is also NOT a put together of the television series in the 60's called the Legend of Custer.  But it is the original movie retitled.  This is The Legend of Custer, the movie.  Just a fact or two.  My uncle had to learn to play the harmonica for this movie.  That is really him played the tunes.  And also he did his own stunts in this movie.
While the video tape leaves alot to be desired in terms of color and clarity. it means the world to me since my Uncle passed away a few years after completing this film.  If you like old ""B"" movies, you will enjoy this!",1072828800,3,740,4.0344827586206895
