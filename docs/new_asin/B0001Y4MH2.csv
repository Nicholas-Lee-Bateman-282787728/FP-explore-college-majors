8018113,4,B0001Y4MH2,Great film dealing with many issues a person facing from the past. Gina plays so well with drama and guilt in this role.,1263686400,,120,4.260869565217392
8018114,5,B0001Y4MH2,For anyone with ties to Czechoslovakia or an interest in the Holocaust this movie is a very moving story to watch.  I first saw it in 1999 and could watch it endless times.  Both lead characters played a very believable role.  Having stayed in Prague before the fall of communism I felt a deep connection with this movie and the story it told.,1207440000,,343,4.412698412698413
8018115,4,B0001Y4MH2,"The FABULOUS GINA GERSHON is usually stereotyped as some sort of sex/goddess,sex/temptress,but in this film she is finally given a role in which she is allowed to show her full range of acting skills,and she comes thru beautifully. GINA, in this tender love story set in post-communist Prague is vulnerable,sweet,tender and funny. For some reason, eight years later GINA is still NOT being used properly by the Hollywood executives. Rade Serbedzija is also excellant as GINAS' lover,his screnes with GINA are pure magic. I won't give away any of the plot,except to say the road to happiness for an American woman and Czech man is not easy. The DVD has exellent photography,but no extras-this is not acceptable",1144368000,3,709,5.068376068376068
8018116,2,B0001Y4MH2,"Set in the Czech Republic, in the 1990's not long after the fall of Communism and the advent of democracy in that country.
A pretty mediocre movie starring ...as a young American psychologist writer, and her romance with Jerzy , a former Czech dissident who is going up in the world.
Things become when it is revealed that her grandfather was a Nazi architect, noted for his cruelty , who is remembered by Jerzy's father , a holocaust survivor.
The storyline is interesting and the lead actor, ..., plays a powerful part as Jerzy ,and....is also a good actresses,  but the film is very dragged out in many parts , and does not quite pull together.",1041120000,4,647,4.577586206896552
8018117,4,B0001Y4MH2,"This 1997 film is filmed almost entirely in Prague.  There's  beauty here, but also a rather upsetting atmosphere of the city's former history dating back to the 1930s.  When an American doctor, played by Gina Gershon, goes there for a convention she meets a Czechoslovakian writer, played by Rade Serbedzha.  It doesn't take long for love to blossom.  But then she starts to delve into her own Czech roots.  What she discovers is not pleasant to learn.
There is a big theme here about war crimes and how they affect people down through the generations.  The film explores all this and gives the couple's romance a devastating twist.  Gina Gershon is beautiful, and I'm glad to see that she wore glasses in most of the scenes.  Rade Serbedzha is also good, and there is definitely electricity between the couple.  The script is quite good too, introducing the important details at just the right pace.
But, even though there was tension, I just didn't feel it.  I watched the whole thing feeling quite detached and knowing that I just wasn't getting pulled into the story. And so my recommendation for this film is only a mild one in spite of its interesting theme.",1037404800,7,1165,4.717821782178218
8018118,5,B0001Y4MH2,"I love the moving, heartfelt performances of
Gina Gershon and Rade Serbedzija in this touching
made for cable telefilm. GG and RS share wonderful
romantic chemistry. Rade Serbedzija is brilliant as Jiri-the
gentle, sweet middle-aged ""surprised by love"" Czech/Jewish ex-
dissident writer. The supporting cast of Eastern European actors all give very good performances. I fell in love with the
city of Prague after seeing it`s scenic beauty featured in this
telefilm. The soundtrack is beautiful(special mention to Boris Zelkin`s original score) and perfectly suited to each
scene. The film is not only a beautiful, touching romance but also
deals with the troubled pasts of both the lead characters and the
effects of the Holocost on future generations. The film is sen-
sitively directed by Roger S.Simon.
 Thank You Image Entertainment and Cinetel film for releasing
this telefilm on video and DVD.

8018119,3,B0001Y4MH2,"The story is interesting, the setting often beautiful and the acting is fine, but somehow the situation facing the main characters does not grab at one's heart as it should. I assume it must be the fault of the script and pacing of the movie.
The movie is about a love affair between an American doctor of Czech Jewish heritage and a prominent dissident Czech writer who meet in Prague. A canker in the rose is uncovered part way through the movie. The doctor's grandfather was not the suffering hero he said he was during the second world war. He was a Nazi collaborator who was particularly vicious toward the writer's father. He changed his name and his identity when he emigrated to the US.  When the love affair and the identity of the doctor's grandfather become known to the Czech community, the couple is hounded by the press and the writer's integrity is questioned. The main theme of the movie is: can their love survive both the shame of the past and the stress of the present?  A good movie if you want to see scenes of Praque and enjoy looking at its main actors, but I wish it had tugged my heartstrings more.",979257600,11,1123,4.4731707317073175
