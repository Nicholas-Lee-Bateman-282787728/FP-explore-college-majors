8150885,5,B000JJJONG,"Family Secrets came out in 1984. It starts Maureen Stapleton, Stefanie Powers & Melissa Gilbert. See if you can spot a brief appearance by Gary Sinise (CSI - NY) in only his second film! A young James Spader also has a part in the film. Maureen Stapleton, Stefanie Powers and Melissa Gilbert represent three generations of women who come together to face their secrets and fears they have kept buried throughout the years. Recently widowed, Stapleton invites her divorced daughter Powers, and Powers' illegitimate daughter Gilbert for a weekend get-together. The catalyst for the film's cascade of bickering, reminiscences, and regrets is Stapleton's announcement that she plans to move from the family home and into a condominium. Not rated, Vista Home Video; 96 minutes.
