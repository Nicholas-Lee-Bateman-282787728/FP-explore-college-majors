8072814,3,B000A2WDR6,"I enjoyed this movie.
It's far from a classic,
but it had a lot of action,
a pretty good plot,
stereotypical characters
acted just about right,
and, importantly,
did not take itself too
seriously, but just seriously
enough.
David Carradine realized his
character just about perfectly.

The story in a nutshell:
Police function has been
privatized and there is a
motley crew ""association""
of bounty hunters,
C.O.P.S., that compete with
each other for the payoff.
The association is rather odd
as it's pretty much every man
for himself,
but probably necessary as a
front for legitimacy.

Tucker (Carradine) is the best
of them, partly due to his
secret computer genius partner
who is also his adopted child
due to an unfortunate accident
that left him paralyzed as a
result of being mistakenly
shot by Tucker when he was six.
Tucker is a gun-slinging urban
cowboy guy who cruises around
in a Jeep Cherokee apprehending
fugitives from justice who
have been sentenced by the courts.
Surrender or die(usually) is
the choice the fugitives have as their
Miranda rights have been reduced
to ""You have the right to die
if you choose"".

C.O.P.S. is one rowdy bunch
of guys and gals.
They spend their leisure time
at the DMZ, a stripper bar
so named because they don't
kill each other there.

There are lots of chases that
cover the underbelly of the city
(appears to be L.A.);
underneath the freeway, alleys,
junkyards, etc.
There are lots of western style
shoot-outs.
Tucker has a high-tech clamp-on
hand weapon that is so ridiculous
it provides great camp.

There are badder than bad guys
who kill gleefully for personal
wealth and power,
shifting alliances and betrayals,
a rocket-propelled-grenade wielding
clergyman, and a 70's/80's West Coast
pop-culture sensibility.

Enjoy this one. I did.
Enough to desire
to check out the sequel.",1254873600,,1829,4.980327868852459
