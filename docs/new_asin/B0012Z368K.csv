3100942,3,B0012Z368K,"Carole (Rebecca Brooke) is a hip young married living in New York. She enjoys an ""open marriage"" with her husband Eddie (David Hausman), but usually restricts her playtime to one other couple, Anna (Chris Jordan) and Pete (porno mainstay Eric Edwards). Her old-fashioned mother Jennifer (the incredible Jennifer Welles - why can't we guys all have mothers like that?) comes for a visit, and is given a crash course in swinging lifestyles; sex with a younger man, quasi-lesbian sex and near incest with her own daughter (in no way believable as there's at most a two-to-three year age difference between Welles and Brooke). In the end, Mom bakes them all a cream pie and runs off with the delivery boy. The end.

All the earmarks of a Joe Sarno film are present in this soft, verging on hardcore sex picture. Followers of this auteur will note his sparse use of a music score, very conservative camera movements and insistence on a consistent storyline. Welles generates much sympathy as the frustrated mother. Her tentative attempts at kindling a friendship with the far too young delivery boy are especially poignant. Welles was a very beautiful and underrated actress who would slip from movie screens two years later after appearing in hardcore features.

Sarno ground out countless sex films throughout his illustrious career, and the usual consumer for this type of film was overly grateful to have a film with plot, acting and direction. This reviewer has always felt a sense of malaise hanging around most sex films. The actors, even if they're game and put forth a little extra effort, all appear keenly aware that the project at hand will not further their career, further their cause or endear them to their dear old Aunt Fanny. Welles and Jordan left the field shortly afterwards, whereas actor Eric Edwards would go on to spread his personality on countless shot-on-video project more than thirty years afterwards.

If ""adult films"" are your cup of tea, a Sarno feature usually delivers on the premise of being as close to a ""real movie"" as this genre gets. Some feel that Sarno's films have a sense of psychological realism that other films in this genre lack - or you may find his stuff clinical and detached as I do.

The DVD from Retro Seduction features an on-camera interview with Sarno, deleted scenes along with a cavalcade of Sarno trailers.",1208217600,37,2362,4.882793017456359

But this movie was actually pretty well acted despite the over the top, thought tittilating story line. LIkely a fairly good depiction of the 70's sexual liberation scene, which I find refreshing and sadly lacking from today's stodgy approach to sexuality. If you liked this era or wish it would return... you will love this movie. If you just like T and A... you will like this movie, too.",1397433600,2,471,4.552941176470588

Terrible acting, with unrealistic dialog, and the kind of background music you would encounter in one of those truly sleazy theaters that specialized in desperate audience.

The sex scenes are anything but interesting, being once again, contrived, heavy handed, and unrealistic.

Do I have to say more?  This film is guaranteed to disappoint you on every level.

3101018,1,B0012Z368K,"To say that this 1974 film is wretched gives the word a whole new meaning. Porn star Eric Edwards doesn't even list it in his filmography. No doubt he's ashamed. He should be. This is softcore tripe of the lowest order, reissued in 2006 as a disc, but it obviously was shot originally in super 8, saved on VHS, and then converted in someone's garage to DVD. Looking back over this, perhaps that gives the production values too much credit. Imagine a nudie sexploitation film written by two boys in high school who then shot it (mostly) in the woods and their mother's kitchen. Throw in a little incest and wife swapping just for fun. Use wooden characters. Try to determine which is worse, the acting or the dialog. Did I say that I didn't care for this film? Whatever I paid for it was too much. On the bright side, the guitar background music wasn't bad, and is included in a separate disc, as is a pretentious booklet about the production.

3101019,5,B0012Z368K,"Confessions of a Young American Housewife belongs in the same sphere as any number of mainstream films of the 70's that examined that decade's lifestyle revolutions (which began in the sixties but didn't become widespread until the Me Decade). Of course, its sexual content kept it out of the larger spotlight. Sexually, the film is softcore, although it plays like hardcore, meaning it is definitely not a bunch of tease. In any event, the movie is an intensified look at open marriages and smartly uses a soap opera style to maximize the middle class melodrama while subverting it at the same time. Director Sarno is also very adept at a form of stagey blocking in which all the actors face the camera but at staggered distances. It effectively shows each characters inner thoughts and processes as the incestuous logic of the swinger credo looms in. Which, incidentally, is a literal term here as a visiting mother (Jennifer Welles and her bombshell body playing the ultimate MILF) and her daughter grown progressively closer as a result of daughter facilitating mother's sexual re-awakening. Daughter is played by Mary Mendum aka Rebecca Brooke, who is a stunning visual presence. She seems to float ethereally as the camera explores her character's face -- a sexually open woman who is yet struggling with her staid, middle class upbringing. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in 70's cinema and/or sexual cinema. It's a gem that has been unearthed and presented in the high quality transfer it deserves.",1211673600,57,1519,5.031746031746032

Terrible acting, with unrealistic dialog, and the kind of background music you would encounter in one of those truly sleazy theaters that specialized in desperate audience.

This is softcore tripe of the lowest order, reissued in 2006 as a disc, but it obviously was shot originally in super 8, saved on VHS, and then converted in someone's garage to DVD. Looking back over this, perhaps that gives the production values too much credit. Imagine a nudie sexploitation film written by two boys in high school who then shot it (mostly) in the woods and their mother's kitchen. Throw in a little incest and wife swapping just for fun. Use wooden characters. Try to determine which is worse, the acting or the dialog. Did I say that I didn't care for this film? Whatever I paid for it was too much. On the bright side, the guitar background music wasn't bad, and is included in a separate disc, as is a pretentious booklet about the production.

3335516,5,B0012Z368K,"Confessions of a Young American Housewife belongs in the same sphere as any number of mainstream films of the 70's that examined that decade's lifestyle revolutions (which began in the sixties but didn't become widespread until the Me Decade). Of course, its sexual content kept it out of the larger spotlight. Sexually, the film is softcore, although it plays like hardcore, meaning it is definitely not a bunch of tease. In any event, the movie is an intensified look at open marriages and smartly uses a soap opera style to maximize the middle class melodrama while subverting it at the same time. Director Sarno is also very adept at a form of stagey blocking in which all the actors face the camera but at staggered distances. It effectively shows each characters inner thoughts and processes as the incestuous logic of the swinger credo looms in. Which, incidentally, is a literal term here as a visiting mother (Jennifer Welles and her bombshell body playing the ultimate MILF) and her daughter grown progressively closer as a result of daughter facilitating mother's sexual re-awakening. Daughter is played by Mary Mendum aka Rebecca Brooke, who is a stunning visual presence. She seems to float ethereally as the camera explores her character's face -- a sexually open woman who is yet struggling with her staid, middle class upbringing. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in 70's cinema and/or sexual cinema. It's a gem that has been unearthed and presented in the high quality transfer it deserves.",1211673600,57,1519,5.031746031746032
