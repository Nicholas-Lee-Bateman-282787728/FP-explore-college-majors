3588601,5,B001FSKE8E,I have been a ER fan for several years and I try not to miss a episode. I relate to the ER as a nurse. I will hate seeing this show end. It will be sadly missed.,1236988800,2,161,3.3783783783783785
3588602,5,B001FSKE8E,I'm a huge fan of ER and I don't know what I'll do when this current season ends. I have all the seasons out on dvd so far (1-10). I can't wait for the rest to come out to complete my collection. I fell in love with this show about 10 yrs ago. I love to re-watch this show over and over again. The storyline is good. I also think all newcomers to this show should invest into buying all seasons out (1-10). I think the show kept getting better and better every year. I would recommend to buying this season.,1236038400,,507,4.02970297029703

3588604,2,B001FSKE8E,"I came on board ER around season 3. I missed most of the hype boat and watched it through season 8. I caught up with the show on TNT and eventually bought a lot of the series. For those that have only been exposed to the series for a couple seasons near the end, PLEASE do yourselves a favor and go back and watch it from the beginning. In terms of themes and character arcs and just from a pure storytelling perspective, this show really did end around season 8. The seasons after that felt more like a spinoff series with some familiar characters and locales thrown in to make a buck off of the long time fans while trying to pull viewers from more contemporary shows.
Season 9 was more of an afterthought to a great series.",1233014400,10,726,4.268115942028985
3588605,5,B001FSKE8E,WHEN I FOUND ER ON TV FOUR YEARS AGO. I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. I COULDNT STOP WATCHING IT. IN FACT I WOULD CHANGE MY SCHEDULE AROUND SO I COULD WATCH THE RERUNS ON TV AND THEN I SOON FOUND OUT THAT THEY SHOWED NEW EPISODES ON THURSDAY NIGHTS. BUT LIKE THE PEOPLE ABOVE ME SAID I THINK THEY NEED TO KEEP THIS SHOW RUNNING FOR THE OTHER ER FANS THAT WATCH THIS. FOR THIS IS THE ONLY GOOD SHOW THAT IS LEFT TO WATCH. AND THE IN FEBRUARY THEY SHOULD RELEASE ALL OF THE REST OF THE SEASONS IN YEAR 2009.,1227052800,,502,3.8365384615384617
3588606,5,B001FSKE8E,"How nice of Warner Bros. to release this set immediately following the airing of ER's final episodes!

As a huge fan of the show, I have been looking forward to this release for a long time. Season 10 was the first season I watched all the way through in it's original airing on NBC. It did not disappoint!

In the first episode, we are introduced to a new character, med student Neela Rosgotra (I know I probably spelled that wrong). Her addition, as well as Linda Cardellini as nurse Sam Taggart and Scott Grimes (recurring until season 12) as med student Archie Morris, breathes new life into the veteran series.

Highlights of the season include (but aren't limited to) Bob Newhart in an Emmy nominated role as a suicidal patient who is losing his sight, a devastating disaster at the hospital, a depressed Mother who sets herself on fire, Abby and Neela's hellish NICU rotation, a tragic mistake on the part of Dr. Pratt, and in the intense season finale, Dr. Kovac springs into action at the scene of an accident.

This season is fantastic, but not perfect. There are a few problems that don't ruin the season, but I think it could've been better without them.

One problem is the writer's extend the Africa storyline too much. The second Africa episode of the series, The Lost, was a necessary and
powerful continuation of the cliffhanger that ended season 9. However,
since Noah Wyle wanted some time off to be with his wife (who was pregnant), the writer's decided to reverse the storyline and have Carter stay in Africa and bring Kovac back to Chicago. I just wish the writers would've created a different explanation for Carter's multi-episode absense instead of leaving him in Africa.

Another downside is while in Africa, Carter meets Kem Likasu. In the most dull and draggty episode of the series (one I haven't been able to watch a second time) we are treated to spending another hour in Africa, where the main point is actually given within the first five minutes of the episode: Carter got Kem pregnant. Kem is an annoying character. She's whiny and critical (wait until the episode where she spends some time
in Chicago). Thandie Newton is a talented actress, and I feel sorry
for her that Kem wasn't a better character. Also, as we'll see in season 11, she really gives Carter a run around. I know she had a miscarrage, but please. Her behavior from that point on made her seem extremely selfish.

So those are my main problems with this season. I know it seems like a spent more time talking about the low points than the high points, but trust me, most of this season is VERY GOOD. The only reason I spent so much time on what I disliked is because this season (and the entire series) is so good that low points are very noticeable. But compared to the lowpoints on other TV shows, season 10's minor flaws are nothing.

If you are an ER fan, you already know why this season is so good. If you're a newer fan who has been following the series on DVD, add this to your collection. It will keep you hooked.",1226361600,27,3025,4.558011049723757
3588607,5,B001FSKE8E,"ER is THE one and ONLY TV show that SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN OFF THE AIR.  With all the new garbage on TV they take the last show worth watching off.

3588726,3,B001FSKE8E,"Not one of my favorite seasons.  I do not like how they ended Carter and Abby's relationship.  I did not like the Africa storyline.  It changed Carter's character to a point of me no longer being sympathetic to him.  He had a pompousness about him and the way he paraded Kem around the ER...it just didn't feel right.  Almost forced.  She was constantly pawing at him and it was embarrassing to watch. I did not like the two of them together. I also thought the Romano storyline was so far-fetched and an unjust end to a great antagonist character of the series.  On the upside, I did like the new characters (Neela, Coop, etc.) and I also liked having Dr. Lewis back.  Her scenes with Bob Newhart where wonderful.  Best part of the season.  Getting back to Carter....one thing that really bugged me is for 9 seasons, he never flaunted his wealth and he spent the whole season basically wining and dining Kem.  Living at Gamma's ""castle"", putting the money down for the brownstone, staying at the fancy hotel, it just seemed so out of character.",1417132800,3,1045,4.564516129032258

3588743,5,B001FSKE8E,"Is this the season where ER jumps the shark?

I was not entirely happy with the ""middle of Africa"" episode at the end of last season, and I literally skipped over this season's episode which took place primarily in the Congo.

This is the first season for a new character, Neela Rasgotra, who will be with the show to the final season. She ends up paired up with Lockhart, since Neela knows the academic stuff, and Lockhart knows everything else.

The arc which really boosts the middle of the season is the three episode guest appearance by Bob Newhart, for which he was nominated for an emmy as best guest appearance in a drama.

This also seems to be a season where medicine takes a back seat to personal lives, tragedies, difficulties, and mistakes and cover ups. This seems to be about the same point in the seasons of Bones where the series seems to go slightly adrift. With Kerry Weaver in personal and professional deep water, the show does not have the kind of anchor of the earlier seasons when William H. Macy was Chief of the ER and Surgery and Aylward was Chief of Staff.

The last episode is another cliff-hanger, almost as tense as the end of season nine, but due to foolishness on the part of Pratt rather than on a medical mystery.

In general, the quality of ER episodes in general is so high, that even a slight drop off is hardly noticed. The brightest discovery is that the series has maintained its momentum in spite of having lost its top four characters from the first five seasons.",1387324800,3,1506,4.498168498168498

I just love the actors and actresses, seeing them so often makes me feel as if I know them personally.  I hate it though when one or two decide to leave at the end of a particular season, never to be seen in the ensuing years.  These movies are loaded with action !!  A typical trauma center with one emergency after another.  If you like to see doctors and nurses and other medical personnel doing their thing, these series are for you.  I actually am learning a lot by just watching, and comparing it to my own trips to an emergency room.  I truly love these movies.

3588760,5,B001FSKE8E,"I always feel kind of weird reviewing a book or TV series here because I feel it's more about the shopping experience. maybe I'm just weird like that. Here's why. What if there is a TV series which I can't stand, but I purchase it as a gift for a family member? Would it be fair to give this purchase a 1 star rating just because I can't stand it myself? No, it would not. Just like I think it's stupid for people to give a 1GB capacity player low stars because it can't hold 10,000 songs, it's not fair to give a TV series I don't like a low star rating here. So, all that being said, ER is a show which I've watched since the day it came out. I won't touch on, or comment about the good and bad points of the season, or the acting, or the character developments because as I've said, I don't feel right reviewing something like that when I feel it's more about the Amazon shopping experience for this type of purchase.

The purchase experience was very good. I ordered this season as a Christmas gift and it was delivered as expected, very fast,, the right packaging, ETC. So, for that I give it a 5 star rating.

BUTT, and a bare one at that, I like it anyway because my sister is an ER nurse and she says it is about one month of big city hospital happenings packed into one episode.

This season only got four stars because they keep cutting out in some episodes to deepest darkest Africa. (Give us a break, and cut out the save the world stuff!) Then they end the season with a car chase and shootout. Not up to the five star status of some previous seasons!

3588780,4,B001FSKE8E,"The show started to change around Season 9 from something that cared about medicine to something that belonged more on daytime TV.

However, in spite of this, there are some really bright spots in Season 10.  In my opinion, it features some of the best episodes until Season 15's ""Old Times"".

Please do not listen to the previous reviews about Africa and Thandie Newton.

Unfortunately, posting sites on the Internet for this show were sieged by `fans' that wanted to see Carter with Abby in all of their daytime TV soap opera nonsense glory.  As a result, their reviews generally portray all non-Abby based episodes as ""bad"".

Thanks to the mentality of these `fans', the show's 10th season gave us endless Abby whining and drama, as well as the unfortunate and over the top, jump-the-shark attack by a helicopter on the persnickety Romano.

Truly dismal stuff.

However, there are several high quality, original episodes in this season.

""The Lost"" is one of the best hours that have been produced on TV in years.  It was exciting, fast paced and informative; what good TV should be.

""Makemba"" combines the tortured existence of AIDS victims in central Africa with the tender and sweet act of falling in love. If you have ever wanted to join the Peace Corps or Doctors Without Borders, then this episode is for you.

This episode also introduces Thandie Newton which finally gives us a lead actress that is as equally expressive in her body and face as Noah Wyle's Dr. Carter.

The two seem well matched with her being someone that has sacrificed a comfortable life to help others after her father was brutally murdered.  And even at County General, she is willing to put herself in danger again to save an apartment full of tuberculosis victims.

We also have a mature relationship for Carter.  Gone are the petty arguments and whining that plagued him in Season 9 with Abby, and they have been replaced with a relationship with someone that doesn't hold a grudge simply because they have argued and who wants a family as much as he does.

The airport scene in ""Impulse Control"" was just recently restaged for Neela's Season 15 exit from the show but, as with most things, the original is the best.

""Midnight"" is consistently rated as one of the saddest episodes in ER history and Wyle and Newton do an excellent job of conveying pain in 2 opposite ways.  Wyle's is open and raw, whereas Newton's is confined and repressed although she reaches out and caresses and holds Carter's hand from time to time.

Susan's arc with Bob Newhart is also noteworthy.

Although these episodes are few, they really helped elevate the show back to the level of high quality drama.  They are worth the purchase price of the entire collection because you are likely to watch them again and again.  They really are that good.",1237766400,4,2812,4.7407407407407405

3588783,4,B001FSKE8E,"ER Season 10

After an extremely weak season nine that marked the first full season without the stabilizing force of the now deceased Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), whose absence is felt throughout a season that is fraught with one dimensional performances, limited storylines, and the shark jumping helicopter accident that lead to the ruining of one of the best antagonists on television, one might have easily seen season nine as the beginning of the end to this long-running television drama.

Luckily for fans of ER, the writers, producers, etc. bounced back with an extremely strong season filled with new cast members and well written stories for our veterans.

On March 3rd Warner Home Video released the complete tenth season of ER on a six disc set, and from the opening segment of the first episode of season ten ""Now What?"" in which Carter (Noah Wyle) returns from Africa to the bedside of Abby (Maura Tierney) in a moment so well crafted visually and musically to be described as nothing less than elegant, just before Abby awakes and rips carters heart out in a manner sure to make all men shudder, fans were notified that ER was truly back and that this season was to be something special.

For the most part season ten lives up to the expectations established by the opening segment of the first episode.  Though the second episode does not take place in the ER, but rather in Africa as Carter returns in search of Lukas (Goran Visnjic) body after the staff is informed of his death, it contains some of the most dramatic, well written, and well acted, moments of the series thus far.

The writing in season ten does, to an extent, return to the roots of the show, and allow for the stories of the patients to take more of the focus than in season nine, and this is a welcome relief. Yes, there are still plenty of wonderful storylines revolving around the cast including those already mentioned from the second episode, but the show was built on a balance of the two, and this season reflects a quality found in balance.

Bob Newhart makes several appearances in a heartfelt Emmy nominated performance as a suicidal elderly man, slowly losing his sight, who is befriended by Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield).  There are many other well written storylines that revolve around visitors to the ER including a mother who sets fire to herself in front of her son in ""Out of Africa"", a visit from some Amish teenagers in ""Missing"", the family in crisis in ""NICU"" and many more. Unfortunately not all the stories in season ten are golden.  Dr. Romano (Paul McCrane) now only has one arm, and though this situation creates some reasonably enjoyable moments as in ""Dear Abby"", the character is no longer as much fun as he used to be.  The writers have fixed something that was oh so far from broken, and it just does not work.  The final appearance of Dr. Romano in ""Freefall"" marks some of the worst writing of the season, and the loss of the best antagonist ever to hit the ER before or after.  McCrane deserves much praise for his performance, as the likes of the Rocket will not be seen again on television anytime soon.

There is great chemistry in the cast of season ten, but simply not enough for everyone to do. The cast would be thinned in coming years, and though some members will be missed, it is for the best. Though season ten marks the introduction of some fine new characters including Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris and Parminder Nagra as Neela Rasgotra, both of which play key roles in the success of the show beyond season ten, Linda Cardellini takes a bit longer to settle into her shoes as youthful take charge nurse Sam Taggert.  Taggerts storylines are simply too contrived during season ten, and the performance is inconsistent.

As in previous releases there is not a lot of bonus material.  For the most part the deleted scenes entitled ""Outpatient Outtakes"" have been deservedly deleted.  The exception may be the clips from ""Blood Relations"" where the scenes are actually enjoyable to watch after viewing the episode.  The one gag reel is cute at best.

Recommendation: Season ten is for both the true fan of the show or someone new to the ER. This is simply quality television to be enjoyed by all.",1237680000,4,4242,4.67741935483871
3588784,5,B001FSKE8E,"The first episode of Season 10, ""The Lost"", was astonishing and by itself worth the price of this set.  I have never seen such amazing, powerful writing and acting on the small screen.  I was absolutely blown away.

""The Lost"" is incredible on so many levels-- in portraying the insanity that was taking place in Africa through the eyes of individual people, in showing the friendship between Carter and Kovacs, and simply in illuminating so many things that are true about the human spirit.  It is scary, serious, tense, and full of unexpected twists.  By the end of this episode, Carter and Kovacs feel absolutely real.  You will be deeply moved and uplifted by the choices these characters make.  How often does any of us reach the end of a television program feeling that way?  This episode was an amazing milestone for the actors, writers, and audience.  If it was a film, I think it would be an Oscar nominee.  (One note for sensitive viewers-- this is a violence-filled episode, definitely not suitable pre-teens.  Violence includes sexual assault, systematic murder, etc. ...)

I do agree with another reviewer's comment that Carter's choices in the episodes after he returns from Africa are a bit frustrating-- not what we hope for.  But that's okay.  There's lots to love with the new characters, and lots of the great ER medical drama we've come to expect.

Highly recommended.",1237507200,2,1388,4.871794871794871
