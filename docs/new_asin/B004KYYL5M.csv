4398693,5,B004KYYL5M,"I just discovered the Animusic team and watched this BD. As I am a computer programmer, I can figure out the job they did and the time they spent to do this. And they thank their families in the end credits (for their patience I assume). Not only the animations are great but the musics too. You can find there electronic and classical musics, even a drums-set on track 8. I like the bonuses, especially the third animation.

I hope there will be a next one.",1300492800,3,458,4.325581395348837

4398707,4,B004KYYL5M,"A friend emailed a link to ""Resonant Chamber"" on YouTube about a year ago,
and I found it interesting enough to purchase it, and ""Pogo Sticks"", the only two tracks
available in iTunes.

Though purportedly ""HD"" in iTunes, the visual quality on this
""Animusic HD"" blu ray disc is very discernibly higher.

As nearly as I can tell, this disc is ""Animusic 2"", plus ""Pipe Dream"" from ""Animusic 1"",
all in HD versions.
Also included are three tracks in SD from ""Animusic 1"":  namely, ""Aqua Harp"", ""Drum Machine"", and
""Harmonic Voltage"", as well as other bonus material, discussing and displaying the technique.

I'm very glad to have this, especially in blu ray, but it's worth noting that, at least imho,
the visuals, while fascinating initially, are repetitive,
and the music, while suited to this format, is hardly revelatory or exquisite.

I do recommend these projects, but perhaps it is just as well that it takes these folks 5-8 years to complete
each one.  Small doses are prescribed.

'3' should be out next month, and I do look forward to it.",1391126400,,1046,4.777777777777778

4398721,3,B004KYYL5M,"I've got the original Animusic and was hoping for a bit more. This feeling comes from the style that is used on almost all of the songs; one of robots.  By that I mean that instead of the kind of clockwork playing that occurs in ""Pipe Dream' (from Animusic 1 and enhanced to HD), he/they use much more full robots or arms of robots playing the 'instruments' with nice light shows going on.
For me it's like ""Star Wars: A New Hope vs. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"", both are Star Wars, but IV is way better than I.",1358640000,2,514,4.191919191919192

8433588,4,B004KYYL5M,"TL;DR version:
HD: Pipe Dream and Animusic 2 in its entirety
SD: Aqua Harp, Drum Machine, Harmonic Voltage, other bonus stuff.
Buy on Animusic's website for $20.

Long version:

For all intents and purposes, this should be called ""Animusic 2 HD.""

I purchased from Animusic.com for $20, cutting out the middleman and funding Wayne and David directly, as it was $60 on Amazon at the time.

From the second I put in the disc, I was amazed even at the Heavy Light menu, showing off the video and audio quality but not advancing past the first minute to leave new viewers unaware of the awesomeness that ensues. Main program plays after being idle 5 minutes.

The main program begins with Pipe Dream 1, and then all the tracks from Animusic 2, all in such mind-blowing high definition that it's nearly indescribable. Even the fade-in for Starship Groove was impressive. The lights are vibrant, the darks are truly dark instead of pixelated crap. Even the textures on the pentagonal laser-speakers are visible. I haven't been this impressed with ""Groove"" since I saw it on PBS when I was 9 years old. Even as the ship drives past the camera at the end, you can almost feel the engines, even without an advanced audio setup.

I won't go into detail on the others, but be assured they're all equally mindblowing. Fiber Bundles was particularly orgasmic.

Bonus features: Before buying, I couldn't find details on exactly which Animusic 1 tracks were included in standard definition. They are
1. Aqua Harp
2. Drum Machine
3. Harmonic Voltage. I'm disappointed all tracks from both volumes weren't included at least in standard definition if not HD. I'm not sure of the technical reasoning behind it, but from what I know of Blu-Rays, they all could've fit AT LEAST in SD. Bonus features also include both ""Inside Animusic"" shorts from the video podcast as well as trailers for both volumes, and some alternate camera angles for Resonant Chamber, Gyro Drums, and both Pipe Dreams.

This is as far as I'm concerned an outstanding substitute for my Animusic 2 DVD, but I can't live without Future Retro, Stick Figures, and Acoustic Curves. Here's hoping they're included in Animusic 3, whenever that is...",1435536000,6,2194,4.847593582887701

8433590,5,B004KYYL5M,"First off, I bought directly from Animusic's site.  Much cheaper there.
Even if you have Animusic 1 and 2 DVDs, get this Blu Ray!

8433591,5,B004KYYL5M,"This HD album is great, and I highly recommend it, but why would you buy it here for $42.95 when you can get it for $19.95 at Animusic's website?",1424131200,2,145,4.0344827586206895
