510109,5,6302789648,"It is wartime England - 1944 - and Germany is bombarding Britain with her ghastly new V2s or ""doodlebugs"". In a small hospital the staff go about their business stoically enough but the place is seething with romantic tension. Nurse Linley's (Sally Gray) engagement with anaesthetist Dr Barnes (Trevor Howard) looks like it may be off as she agrees to go to the hospital dance with the womanising surgeon Eden (Leo Glenn). And Eden's ex, Sister Bates (Judy Campbell), is, understandably, none too happy and out to stir up a bit of trouble. Meanwhile a doodlebug has injured the local postman and he is brought in for surgery. His injuries are minor ones so it's a bit suspicious the way he suddenly dies as the nitrous oxide is administered. Sister Bates announces that she knows it is more than suspicious: it is murder and she has found the evidence to prove it. Soon after this announcement, she too is found dead. Along comes alarming full-of-himself Inspector Cockrill (Alastair Sim) from Scotland Yard to sort everything out.

This is a beautiful old whodunit, an absolute joy from start to finish. All the performances are excellent, but as was invariably the case, as soon as Alastair Sim appears on the scene, everyone else fades into the background besides that astonishing actor's mesmerizing screen presence. Watch it on a cold dark winter night in a cosy room with a big mug of cocoa and the `phone off the hook.",1096329600,6,1425,4.7926829268292686
510110,5,6302789648,"What a shame that in these days of films filled with violence, sex, and crappy acting that films like Green for Danger are so totally unappreciated, especially by this generation. Personally I have never seen a film with such brooding atmosphere in one scene and then such a light whimsical touch in others.  Alaistair Simm is a triumph throughout and at the zenith of his powers. Simms was a man who could turn the talent of a  classical actor to comedy drama with a verve that surely no current actors could replicate. I have so many favourite scenes from this film but Simm's summing up and his reaction to the final realisation is just fabulous.  A word must also be said for the tremendous support from a whole host of stalwart British character actors who only suffer moderately against Simms'performance.  Also the production and direction sets the scene beautifully -  without spending millions!!
I would recommend all film lovers to watch this on a cold dark night with a hot drink and a dash of fear.",1073433600,5,1010,4.715909090909091
510111,5,6302789648,"Alastair Sim is tragically remembered today for only one role:  he was without any question the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, and usually the only film that anyone today has seen featuring Sim is his 1951 turn in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  In fact, Sim starred in a wide range of comedic and dramatic roles in the 1940s and 1950s.  He was a familiar enough presence that Alec Guinness paid homage to him by doing a straightforward imitation of Sim  in the 1955 film THE LADYKILLERS, evening wearing false teeth to look more like Sim.
Sim managed to play in a large number of comedic suspense and mystery films.  He starred in a series of Inspector Hornleigh films in the early forties, he went on to play memorable roles in wartime mysteries such as COTTAGE TO LET (with a very young John Mills in a key role), GREEN FOR DANGER, AN INSPECTOR CALLS (in which he plays a ghostly police inspector), and THE GREEN MAN, in which Sim plays a congenial assassin.  But Sim also excelled in pure farce, and was magnificent in such films as THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE, LAUGHTER IN PARADISE, and the St. Trinian movies, which he played largely in drag.  Sim, with his large frame, lugubrious eyes, and marvelously dramatic voice, was a delight in every film he graced, but today is primarily known for Scrooge, as noted above.
There is actually a very good historical reason for the demise of Sim's reputation and of British cinema in general.  In the fifties and sixties, French auteur criticism came more and more to dominate European and American film criticism.  One of the central assumptions of auteur critics has been that British cinema, with the almost exclusive exception of pre-Hollywood Hitchcock and the workd of Michael Powell and Eric Pressburger, has been an aesthetic wasteland.  As an ardent fan of forties and fifties British cinema, I know that this is an utterly false representation of what was actually happening in England.  There were a number of excellent directors and a large number of superb actors and actresses who somehow or other were not siphoned off by Hollywood.
GREEN FOR DANGER is one of Sim's finest films.  The plot is largely superfluous.  A postman dies in an operation in WW II England, under shady circumstances, and the great Inspector Cockrill is called in to solve the mystery.  The movie is entirely a showcase for Sim's eccentric histrionics.  The movie sinks or swims entirely on how one responds to Sim:  if you love him (as I do), you will love this movie.  If you dislike Sim (I reaction that would utterly mystify me), you will dislike this film.
I strongly urge all lovers of film comedy to search this film out.  I especially recommend this to lovers of British cinema.  I will add that I believe this to be the best film that Alastair Sim ever made, though I would hasten to add that he made a dozen others very nearly as good.  They are large hard to find these days, but searching them out will definitely repay the effort.",1007078400,131,2967,4.680154142581888

510139,5,6302789648,"A marvelous thriller from 1946 that gives you an opportunity to watch Alastair Sim (Scrooge) and not have to wait for Christmas.  Sim never made any American films, and his British ones are hard to find, but if you are a fan of his you don't want to miss this superb Criterion re-issue.  ""Danger"" takes place in an English country hospital during WW11, and starts out slow, as any good mystery does, establishing all the character back stories so the audience doesn't know who the killer is.  But when the killer does strike, there's plenty of suspense, and it allows for Sim, as the Scotland Yard inspector, to take over.  Sim is absolutely fantastic, and he must be the most idiosyncratic actor ever. Americans should also recognize Trevor Howard and Leo Genn, as two of the doctors.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  I can only wish that Amazon will offer more Alastair Sim movies in the future.",1426118400,4,909,4.614906832298137

510144,5,6302789648,I saw this movie in the when I was a kid .  All I could remember was Leo Genn's marvelous voice.  I was concerned about the age of the movie: no worries!

510145,4,6302789648,"The film opens with a creepy voice-over, the voice informing us that of six main characters in a rural hospital, three doctors and three nurses,  one of the six  is a murderer and two people will die. The first death is that of  the local postman, amid shelling by German warplanes as this is during  World War II.

The circumstances are suspect, Inspector Cockrill is called upon to find who dunnit. Alistair Sim is such a huge presence it's as though he were orchestrating the plot, even directing the movie. As he always does, Sim throws himself into the role and when he is on stage there just is nobody else. His expressive eyes, his pratfalls like falling clumsily over a fence and then deftly leaping back over, his  distinct voice, that subtle sarcastic smile- he is a very formidable package indeed. The great Leo Genn who plays Doctor Eden is wasted in this movie, he does not have the opportunity or space  to be a great character, such as the  psychiatrist in ""The Snake Pit"" or even a supporting actor such as Starbuck in ""Moby Dick."" Trevor Howard as Doctor Barnes  appears rather a suspicious person at times, at other times a not overly adept lover, but he never quite gels. Several little dramas go on during the movie, Inspector Cockrill meanwhile keeps his suspects in line, calming their anxieties like a benevolent uncle but he laughs uproariously when the two medical doctors, Eden and Barnes, engage in a most inappropriate fist fight.

You will notice, as a modern viewer, that everybody including the doctors chain-smokes. The suspects are not gathered in a stately home library but in the operating room where the Inspector will Reveal All. The operating room itself doesn't appear very authentic but medicine has come a long way since 1944.

510148,4,6302789648,"The first half of the commentary is slightly better than the second half. It blends interpretive material about the film and the way the film is shot with background information about the participants (their lives and careers). The second half relies more heavily on this background material. Nevertheless, Bruce Eder makes his comments, even the most informational ones, interesting. He is especially good at making comparisons between the film and the novel on which it is based. He is also good (especially in the first half) at calling attention to little lines of dialogue that are especially sharp and witty and easily missed. One of these occurs when an anesthetist shows a police inspector the operating room where a murder occurred. He points out a cannister of nitrous oxide. ""Oh, yes--like what the dentist gives you--laughing gas,"" the inspector says. ""Right,"" says the doctor. ""Actually, the impurities cause the laughs."" And the inspector quickly replies: ""Just like in the music halls."" (What a good and useful theory about comedy, I thought. When we laugh, it is usually some little impurity of life that is making us smile.)",1402790400,,1141,5.106951871657754

The biggest surprise of the movie for me was the performance of the inspector, Alastair Sim, who played Scrooge in the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol. I was really surprised by his humorous, subtle performance in this movie. I hope more people get to know this actor's work. This movie is a great place to start.

510200,5,6302789648,"The down load and other DVD's work but the Criterion version is better.

It is the war 1944. A post man is almost dispatched by the terrible V1. He goes under surgery by a hand full of medical personnel including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and assisting nurses. He does not survive and has been almost certainly dispatched by one of the medical entourage.

One of the best complex murder mysteries. Everything you want in a mystery. I you watch and listen closely you find the means motive and execution method of the murder. Then we though in the fact everyone looks guilty and maybe is. Each character seems to carry a secret even it does not have a direct bearing on the victoms demise.

Based on a book by Christianna Brand published in 1944 set against the background of the London Blitz.  The screen play uses Inspector Cockrill (Alastair Sim) as the narrator.

Defiantly get the Criterion version with a very useful commentary by film scholar Bruce Eder, originally recorded in 1993 that is just as interesting as the film its self. You may even want to read the book.

Added to the numerous ways America rigs commerce in their favor I would add the limited quantity of British films available, while America devours ""Rocky,RockyII,Rocky III etc.,. This is a perfect mystery gem from Sidney Gilliat adding ingenious drama and suspense to the anxious lives of war-torn England, as seen from a handful of surgery workers. Alistair Sim, everybody's Dickens,(no fluke) appears here as the more-than-capable Inspector who will in time solve the unit's unexpected homicide case. Of course, it is more complex than that, with marital philandering, social-climbing, yes, careerism rearing their ugly heads throughout this isolated village happening, making it so real in your head that you will, in the hands of cinematographer Wilkie Cooper, believe this black-and-white masterpiece is in vivid color. There's also a wonderful cast of comely actresses (Sally Gray)in healthy competition for Trevor Howard's favor finely drawn so as to not compete with the building suspense or seem superfluous to the drama. The richness of character delineation here is rarely equaled in American cinema. You may, like me, realize after viewing this classic, that it more than inspired a future Dr. Kildare, Dr. Welby or even a Twilight Zone episode by its very originality.",1353196800,,1370,5.406542056074766
510212,5,6302789648,"A seemingly natural death is later found to be murder. Six persons were in the room at the time of the murder. All had motive and opportunity. We watch the murder happen along with the six people; yet, like them, we do not immediately understand how it was done, or by which one. We are not even certain it was murder.

A clever ""who dunnit and how?""

The film shows us five of the six people's motives for murder during the first 30-minutes of the 1-1/2-hour film; mostly jealous love triangles. The motive of the sixth person comes later. Just as the film starts to drag at 33-minutes; things take-off as murder is discovered and the killer must cover his/her tracks, and the clever police-inspector from Scotland-Yard arrives; played by Alastair Sim.

You will think about turning-off this film before the 33-minute mark, because it seems the film is going nowhere; but if you are patient; things take-off during the last hour of the film, and escalate. It becomes a battle of wits between the inspector and the murderer. The murderer is desperate, and will not hesitate to murder those discovering clues, meaning the other five people who were in the room at the time of the murder.

The suspense is genuine as the story reaches its climax in the operating room where the first murder is recreated.

The script is witty, at times downright hilarious.  Director Sidney Gilliat keeps things moving at a rapid pace, never allowing the audience to take a break from the mounting suspense.

The entire cast is excellent, with a standout performance by Alistair Sim as the eccentric inspector assigned to the case.  The most effective scenes take place in the operating room, where the masked actors are forced to rely solely on their eyes to convey their feelings.

This is a rich and whimsical British mystery, the type popular with fans of Agatha Christie, for instance.  It's set during the German blitz of Great Britain during World War II, and Gilliat backdrops the rather personal mystery held within an insular community with the Pavlovian terror of the bombings and the issue of world affairs in the heart of many a character's motivations.  Otherwise, the motive behind the movie is kind of a let down, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the fun behind ""whodunnit"".  The movie really gets started when Alastair Sim arrives as the quirky, wry investigator.  He's a scene-stealer in every way, surrounded as he his by the usual in characters with strong personalities too involved in their own ways to be more than just a little truthful.

510220,4,6302789648,"I always hate movies that open up with all of the cast introduced one by one wearing surgical masks.  But here, it works better than in its rivals, because of the suspense factor involved.  When Alistair Sim's narrating character, Inspector Cockrill, tells us that two of these people will soon be dead, and a third a murderer, naturally we get curious.  Yes, it is a bit of a stretch distinguishing between the four female characters, and in fact I think the screenwriters actually forgot to do much about one of them (or else some scenes hit the cutting room floor), but they are played by some tragically overlooked stars of England, so I enjoy myself just working out who is who.  When Freddie can't make up her mind between Trevor Howard, to whom she is engaged, or Leo Genn, the little Mike Myers lookalike who's supposedly a brilliant surgeon here, she's hard to sympathize with, and in fact she seems a bit of a tart.

She is played by the brilliant Sally Gray, whose own personal life was more dramatic than any two or three of her movies.  She was an up and coming starlet in the early 40s when a nervous collapse took her off the screen for four or five years.  GREEN FOR DANGER was only her third film after her dramatic comeback, and audiences would have been scrutinizing ""Freddie"" carefully, the way they did Gene Tierney in ADVISE AND CONSENT, for any lingering signs of instability.  It's still hard to understand how she got insured.  Gray seemed to want to travel deeper into neurosis after her cure, and of course the British cinema likewise had grown darker and more crime-driven.  Then we have Judy Campbell as Sister Bates, the tall actress with the Kay Francis look.  Campbell's films are few, she only made ten, but she is well known for her creative partnership with Noel Coward, for her introduction of ""A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,"" and for being the mother of the only and only Jane Birkin!  Little of Campbell's chic or cheer shows through the anguish of her characterization of the abandoned mistress here, but she certainly commands attention when she runs around the nurses and doctors dance crying to all and sundry that she has figured out the murder.

That bit is one of the screenplay's occasional clunkers.  Like the end when Cockrill asks all the suspects to re-enact the crime, using Freddie as bait.  The plot needs these things to happen, but Sidney Gilliatt's direction fails to disguise how convenient and unbelievable these developments are.

Sally Gray was to re-team with Christianna Brand (the author of the novel GREEN FOR DANGER and one of the certified Golden Age detective writers) on another film, the little seen THE MARK OF CAIN, directed by the fascinating Brian Desmond Hurst, that Criterion should release next.",1222819200,,2779,4.77035490605428

Postman Joseph Higgins (Moore Mariott) is knocked flat by a German buzz bomb during the height of World War II and finds himself scheduled for surgery at local hospital.  It should be a simple operation, but something goes wrong even before the first incision is made, and Higgins is suddenly dead on the table.  Sister Bates (Judy Campbell) announces, under the least inauspicious circumstances imaginable, that it was murder----and before you can say ""Scotland Yard"" Inspector Cockrill (Alistar Sim) is on the case.

Brand's novel is famous for its use of the hospital and operating room as settings, and at the time the plot was considered quite a twister too.  The latter may no longer be case, but the setting holds up extremely well in this film adaptation, largely thanks to a host of memorable performances, sold work from director Sidney Gilliat, and atmospheric cinematography by Wilkie Cooper.  The script, co-written by Gilliat and Claude Guerney, is a bit talky, but the cast works wonders with it, and the film will hold you attention to the end.

The Criterion DVD includes an interesting if somewhat too academic audio commentary and bonus feature; the transfer, however, is excellent, very crisp.  Strongly recommended for fans of the classic English murder mystery.

510254,5,6302789648,"Director Gilliat fashioned this atmospheric, intelligent murder mystery, beautifully restored and available for the first time via the Criterion Collection. ""Green"" maintains foreboding throughout, leavened by the superlative Sim's dry wit. Though his on-screen entrance occurs well into the film, Sim's Cockrill, a fearless detective who becomes terrified at the sound of buzz-bombs, still dominates the proceedings through his methodical paces to uncover the whys and wherefores of the case-and nab a murderer.",1182470400,2,512,6.027397260273973
510255,5,6302789648,"There's no denying ""Green For Danger"" is a winning, particularly witty murder mystery, a genre the Brits do markedly well. What singles this effort out more than anything else, I'd say - and in agreement with most earlier  reviewers here - is the presence, odd character and extraordinary voice of Alastair Sim. His police inspector is a wonderfully sarcastic fellow yet, as a human being, oddly detached. As Leo Genn and Trevor Howard begin a serious fight, for instance, rolling about on the floor of a hospital room and possibly about to do serious damage to one another, Sim, with great delight, pulls up a chair so he can more closely watch and enjoy the violence. What an unusual detective, this! Vocally, too, it's a joy to hear his plummy, over the top savoring of every syllable he utters. His voice, like Edith Evans,' is one of the great (here preserved) treasures of English stage and screen.",1174867200,7,904,4.75796178343949
510256,5,6302789648,Well criterion has done it again....the film looks terrific and im really glad they window boxed this so now you can view this film like it was intended...with that said the great Alister Sim as inspector cockrill and a bunch of worthy suspects that keep you guessing right till the end. If you haven't purchased this title i only have 1 thing to say....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????,1174780800,7,382,4.632352941176471
510257,5,6302789648,Alistair Sim has perpetrated a crime on movie fans. He has stolen the character of Cockrill and made a classic detective film. Then he stole the character back by not making any more. Thus he has robbed the movie public from taking further pleasure in any more gems. For the former we feel lucky for the latter we hold him accountable for the crime of theft. Twenty years in the slammer.  See this film and weep that they seldom make films like this any more.,1174521600,6,459,4.4

510260,5,6302789648,"This is a wonderful film, based on a wonderful novel by the wonderful Christianna Brand. It's a murder mystery set in a WWII British hospital operating theater--how's that for a locked room and a small group of suspects?!--and it's a perfect example of the Golden Age of British filmmaking.

GREEN FOR DANGER is rightly celebrated for its stylish direction, literate script, and excellent performances (especially Alastair Sim as the eccentric Inspector), but the new Criterion DVD really showcases what may be its greatest asset, the stunning black-and-white cinematography of Wilkie Cooper with cameraman Oswald Morris (Morris would go on to win 5 American and British Academy Awards in his career). Every shot, start to finish, is a thing of beauty. The mystery is clever, and Alastair Sim is fun, but this film is truly a visual work of art. The newly-restored Criterion print makes this abundantly clear. Suspenseful, entertaining, and gorgeous to look at--what more could you want in a mystery movie? Enjoy!

PS: If you can find them, track down and read some of Christianna Brand's mystery novels. She really is the unsung ""sister"" of Christie, Sayers, and Tey--and every bit as good.",1173484800,5,1191,5.134020618556701
510261,4,6302789648,"In entertaining little piece with good acting. The story line unfolds as in a book. It's a movie of the old genre, no gimmicks, no loud music, no pyrogenics, no high speed chases or crashes; just a good story well acted.

It's a 'Casablanca' type movie",1173484800,,252,4.478260869565218
510282,4,6302789648,"Great movie and all of the actors, particularly Sim, are great. The plot towards the end is rather ridiculous though and that is why I just give it 4 stars.  The whole proposition of reenacting the surgery where Higgins died just doesn't ring true.  Why would the killer try to kill the nurse during the same set of circumstances that Higgins was killed in, i. e. during the surgery?  This isn't believable.  The twist about the hyperdermic was neat though.",1173312000,,457,4.675
510283,3,6302789648,"Despite the critics, this is a very ordinary, grade B mystery.  The acting is mediocre, the plot is preposterous, and the budget was low.  It's probably Alastaire Sim who has prompted many viewers to rate this film highly.  He truly was a presence on the screen.  But he's much more persuasive in Scrooge and his several comedies, especially The Green Man.  An Inspector Calls is another Sim B mystery.  Neither is worth your time and money.  Better to buy Charlie Chan; at least those films contain some comedy.",1171756800,9,512,4.75
510284,5,6302789648,"Like one of the other reviewers, I recall the chapter-long discussion of this wonderful film in THE DETECTIVE IN FILM, a great book about movie mysteries that you can and SHOULD seek out at a second hand bookstore. It made me want to see the film and read the book. I know I'm paraphrasing the above film resource somewhat when I say that, in addition to the amazing performances by Alistair Sim as Inspector Cockrill and the other members of a terrific cast of suspects, the cinematography is fantastic. I cannot wait to see a clean print, such as I have come to expect from Criterion; the only prints I've seen have been old scratchy reels of film. There are many elements of the horror film used here, and the scenes where the murderer's travels are shown from that person's point of view are especially effective. What's more, as a devout mystery lover, I have to give kudos for the screenplay's retention of the complex and effective plot. This isn't one of those many mysteries of the 30's and 40's where the least likely suspect (usually some genial friend or father figure) turns out to be the killer, or where you know the murderer's identity because of the actor who plays the part. (Did Ralph Morgan ever NOT play the killer???)

I don't know if any of you have read Christianna Brand's Inspector Cockrill mysteries, so I'd like to take this opportunity to plug her ten or so mysteries as REALLY great! GREEN FOR DANGER is perhaps the best, with a marvelous denouement (the motive for the initial killing is startlingly original.) But the others all have their charms, especially TOUR DE FORCE, where Cockrill vacations on a tropical island and FOG OF DOUBT, with one of her most effective twist endings where you kick yourself at the end for not uncovering the killer's identity. There was a pattern to Brand's mysteries. She always began by setting up her closed circle of suspects and then telling you something to the effect that ""All of these are nice people, but two of them are future victims and one of them is a murderer."" And then Brand spreads the suspicion around so that you come to care about all these people and hope that NONE of them is brought to justice. Fortunately, Inspector Cockrill doesn't have such a kind heart. And that is, for me, the strength of Brand's writing. Agatha Christie may be more clever in her plotting and cluing, and Dorothy Sayers may be more literate. But Brand creates characters you like and care about, and the endings always leave you feeling sad that this closed circle of friends and family will never be the same due to the violent loss of several of its members.

So to all you mystery lovers out there, read the books and see this movie! It is, in my humble opinion, one of the ten best whodunnits ever produced on film. (I feel a list coming on!!)",1171411200,15,2812,4.5884691848906565
510285,5,6302789648,"I've seen the Criterion dvd of GREEN FOR DANGER and all I can say is ""thank you"" to Criterion for the care they lavished on it.  It is, without question, the finest video presentation ever seen of this brilliant film.  After years of watching dark, grainy 16mm prints on TV (and dark, grainy vhs copies and laserdiscs) it is truly wonderful to see this top-flight dvd.

The film is, of course, the penultimate British murder mystery, the best that has ever been done.  Let's face it: no movie that rates an entire chapter in a book (""The Detective Film"" by Everson) can be dismissed lightly.  Just get the disc and enjoy it.  Those reviewers who recommended you curl up on a cold and windy night with a cup of warm liquid and watch it have given you sage advice.

At last GREEN FOR DANGER's gorgeous cinematography by Wilkie Cooper can be appreciated for the thing of beauty that it is. It is not for nothing that the American Society of Cinematographers included this picture in their list of the Best Photographed Films of the 1940s.  Cooper's work is quite simply marvelous and is a textbook example of how to photograph a black and white film.  This beautiful dvd transfer also enables us to appreciate the fine sets by Peter Proud, an art director of enormous talent and ingenuity.

Criterion also cleaned up the soundtrack to an amazing degree.  I couldn't believe it at first when I heard it.  The dialog is now razor sharp and William Alwyn's music...oh, my goodness is it a nice score!

Here is one that is a must for your library.  Get it and enjoy it.  And if you like it (and I cannot imagine that you wouldn't) go order another wonderful Launder-Gilliat film I SEE A DARK STRANGER.  Again, thanks Criterion!",1171065600,29,1720,4.571895424836601
510286,5,6302789648,"The previous reviewers each got it right.  Sim does a brilliant star turn here.  ""Green for Danger"" was a well-known novel and then a stage play before it was a film.  For once, a sense of staginess sharpens the concentration and adds to the strength of the movie.  Also note that Sim is by no means the only actor worth watching in a superb ensemble cast.

This film, disgracefully chopped up into tiny bits between endless commercials, used to be a staple of broadcast TV in the 1950s, then it disappeared.  At about the age of ten I heard one particular spoken passage from the film that stayed with me for years:

TWO DREAMY LOVERS: (Murmuring) In such a night / Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls / And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, / Where Cressid lay that night.

SIM: (Interrupting) In such a night / Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well, / Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, / And ne'er a true one.

It was a distinct disappointment when I finally discovered that the lines were from Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"" and not original to ""Green for Danger.""",1170201600,5,1103,4.53030303030303
510287,5,6302789648,"Alastair Sim is tragically remembered today for only one role: he was without any question the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, and usually the only film that anyone today has seen featuring Sim is his 1951 turn in A CHRISTMAS CAROL. In fact, Sim starred in a wide range of comedic and dramatic roles in the 1940s and 1950s. He was a familiar enough presence that Alec Guinness paid homage to him by doing a straightforward imitation of Sim in the 1955 film THE LADYKILLERS, evening wearing false teeth to look more like Sim.

Sim managed to play in a large number of comedic suspense and mystery films. He starred in a series of Inspector Hornleigh films in the early forties, he went on to play memorable roles in wartime mysteries such as COTTAGE TO LET (with a very young John Mills in a key role), GREEN FOR DANGER, AN INSPECTOR CALLS (in which he plays a ghostly police inspector), and THE GREEN MAN, in which Sim plays a congenial assassin. But Sim also excelled in pure farce, and was magnificent in such films as THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE, LAUGHTER IN PARADISE, and the St. Trinian movies, which he played largely in drag. Sim, with his large frame, lugubrious eyes, and marvelously dramatic voice, was a delight in every film he graced, but today is primarily known for Scrooge, as noted above.

There is actually a very good historical reason for the demise of Sim's reputation and of British cinema in general. In the fifties and sixties, French auteur criticism came more and more to dominate European and American film criticism. One of the central assumptions of auteur critics has been that British cinema, with the almost exclusive exception of pre-Hollywood Hitchcock and the workd of Michael Powell and Eric Pressburger, has been an aesthetic wasteland. As an ardent fan of forties and fifties British cinema, I know that this is an utterly false representation of what was actually happening in England. There were a number of excellent directors and a large number of superb actors and actresses who somehow or other were not siphoned off by Hollywood.

GREEN FOR DANGER is one of Sim's finest films. The plot is largely superfluous. A postman dies in an operation in WW II England, under shady circumstances, and the great Inspector Cockrill is called in to solve the mystery. The movie is entirely a showcase for Sim's eccentric histrionics. The movie sinks or swims entirely on how one responds to Sim: if you love him (as I do), you will love this movie. If you dislike Sim (I reaction that would utterly mystify me), you will dislike this film.

I strongly urge all lovers of film comedy to search this film out. I especially recommend this to lovers of British cinema. I will add that I believe this to be the best film that Alastair Sim ever made, though I would hasten to add that he made a dozen others very nearly as good. They are large hard to find these days, but searching them out will definitely repay the effort.",1169596800,7,2951,4.680154142581888

Everything about this film, the acting, the writing, the direction, the photography - everything is world class. And Alastair Sim as Inspector Cockrill is the icing on the cake.  If I had any complaint to make against this film it would be this - Why didn't this film lead to a whole series of Inspector Cockrill films?  This is a wonderful piece of entertainment and I would urge any film fan not to miss it.",1164585600,61,584,4.429906542056075
510289,4,6302789648,"""Green for Danger"" is a nicely comported crime drama with an accomplished British cast taking place at the tail end of WW2.  In a countryside English hospital a series of murders has been committed with the operating room staff being suspect.  Featuring the mellifluous narration of the talented Alistair Sim who plays Scotland Yard investigating detective Inspector Cockrill, the film plays out casting suspicion on all the main characters.  Anaesthesiologist Dr. Barnes played by Trevor Howard and ladies man Mr. Eden, the surgeon played by Leo Genn are in competition for the affections of the nurses in the hospital played by Sally Gray, Rosamund John, Judy Campbell and Megs Jenkins.

When local postman Higgins played by Moore Marriott inexplicably dies on the operating table during a routine procedure, it becomes apparent that one of the five OR personnel is complicit.  Sister Bates played by Campbell also is killed after having figured out the identity of the murderer leaving four suspects.  Sim plans a scheme to flush out the murderer by staging a bogus operation which he hopes will repeat the mechanism by which the postman had succumbed.

Sim steals the show as the unconventional cop who much like famous TV detective Columbo apparently stumbles around while all the while has cleverly figured out the mystery of the murders.",1143849600,,1344,5.137614678899083

The Green Man and School for Scoundrels may be out on a DVD in the U.S. in the near future.  It was released a year or so ago in England.  Green for Danger has been released on DVD in England and you can get the the Sim movies from Amazon UK, with only a dollar or so more shipping charge.
