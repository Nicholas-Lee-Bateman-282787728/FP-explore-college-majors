3166994,5,B00171F6Q4,"Where on earth is Season Two of this excellent series?  I have Season One and love it to bits but Season Two was even better.  Also it is a 'family friendly' show with no real violence or bad language, and extremely well acted with great casts backing up Pete Duel and Ben Murphy as Smith and Jones.  Please release it soon.",1221177600,8,324,4.278688524590164
3166995,5,B00171F6Q4,"ASJ is one of my all-time favorite shows.  I bought Season 1 and it's great.  The only thing that bothers me is that sometimes it seems like a few frames are cut from the end of scenes because the dialog or images end a couple seconds too soon; if they had been held just a moment longer, the effect would have been better.  However, this in no way detracts from the overall beautiful job the DVD creators did.

I am eagerly awaiting the release of Season 2.  The only reason I can think of for the delay is that creating the DVD of a 35 year old TV show takes a lot of time to do well.  Maybe restoring the quality of the prints is proving to be very time-consuming.  However, it would be real nice if an anticipated release date were announced; that would go a long way to assuage fans' fears that we'll never see Season 2 on DVD.  And I agree with other reviewers that releasing Season 3 at the same time would be a great idea.

The Season 2 episodes reveal the emotional toll Curry and Heyes' quest for amnesty is taking on them.  Their bantering and humor are more evident as well.  Season 2 also includes stories with ideas that still resonate today: Smiler with a Gun, The Bounty Hunter, The McCreedy Bust--Going, Going, Gone, The Men That Corrupted Hadleyburg, to name a few.  The show is timeless and Season 2 (and Season 3) deserve to be seen again.  Bring out the DVD soon, please!",1215129600,6,1392,4.3076923076923075

3166997,5,B00171F6Q4,"Alias Smith & Jones is the greatest tv show of all time.
The writing and directing was just awesome. They don't
make shows like this anymore. It reminds me of the Rockford
Files for the witty humor and action but in western days.
Duel and Murphy were great together. I was shock and sad
when Duel died but I thought Roger Davis did pretty good
for being thrown in the series. He was also in one of the
best episodes ""smiler with a gun"" and was killed by Curry.
He was also the voice at the beginning of the series! listen!
It was still good until the end. I bought a bootleg of the
entire series years ago and while not top quality it's very
good and I still enjoy it. If and when they releas all 3 seasons
I will replace them & buy the better version but not until so why
don't they go ahead and release them? It's the same with other
popular series like Barnaby Jones, Cannon and other great shows
that have never seen the light of day.",1214524800,5,938,4.131147540983607
3166998,5,B00171F6Q4,My sentiments exactly. The thought of actually being able to own this series is just amazing. I've waited patiently and even worried that it might not happen. Maybe they are waiting to see how many of us have put this on our wish list at Amazon. I have also been waiting for the release of the rest of Big Valley. The first two came out within less than a year's time and then nothing for a year and a half now and still waiting.  I hope DVD's are still a usable format by the time we get the rest of the series or we'll be left waiting all over again. Just a thought. Good luck to us all!,1212969600,8,589,3.9915254237288136
3166999,5,B00171F6Q4,Okay... I ALSO concur with the above reviews and requests for the PROMPT release of not only Season 2 but also the final Season 3!!! WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG FOR BOTH?  I have had Season One since the DAY it came out and have been waiting well over a year for Season Two and so now I better also request that Season THREE also get released... Maybe you could offer a BUY SEASON 2 & 3 TOGETHER for a Special Low Price and I guarantee they will sell you out of stock!  GET WITH IT (as stated above) BEFORE WE FANS ARE ALL GONE!!!,1212969600,9,525,3.9904761904761905
3167000,5,B00171F6Q4,"Alias Smith and Jones Season II - the long desired second season is a must see!  Season one was full of fun, but season two is where we see our favorite outlaws in real action - Kid Curry gets in a quick draw fight and shotots the guy, out manuvering a relentless posse, learning more about the sordid pasts of Heyes and Curry, and Hannibal Heyes even gives us a little guitar action with the song ""Gift to Be Simple"", to name a few.  I've been hopping around the net, and it seems ANYTIME this season is brought up, fans are wailing, ""WHEN'S IT COMING????""

I am no exception.  I can only hope, the answer is SOON!

If you've never seen an Alias Smith and Jones show, you don't know what you're missing.  Pete Duel and Ben Murphy were the perfect pair to play these desperate outlaws trying to go straight.  This was made for TV in the 70's, so it's family safe - and their easy banter back and forth is enough to keep you laughing, while they steal you heart.  :)",1212192000,16,965,4.2349726775956285

Here's a link to the Amazon page about the AS&J Seasons 2 and 3 DVD set:

Pete Duel and Ben Murphy were great actors and their chemistry was great on the show! It's sad that Pete never got the chance to complete the second season. Maybe if he wouldn't have passed away in '71 at such a young age, the show would've went longer. I've been reading reviews for ""Alias Smith and Jones"" season 2 and I agree with them all. They're a lot of fans who want to see the second and third season release.
