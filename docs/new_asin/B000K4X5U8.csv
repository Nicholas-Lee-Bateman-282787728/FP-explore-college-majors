2682361,5,B000K4X5U8,I remember watching this great saturday morning show as a kid and loveing it. this is one show that still holds up well and my kids love it. thanks to bci eclipise for finding it and getting it out for a new generation to see.,1173139200,,226,4.044444444444444
2682362,5,B000K4X5U8,"I was thrilled to see that one of my all time favorite series ""Space Academy"" was coming out on DVD!!!  Naturally, I HAD to order it!!

Back when it was on, I had a HUGE crush on Ric Carrott who played Chris Gentry and I've always been a fan of Pamelyn Ferdin.

I hadn't seen the show since it was first broadcast - 29 years ago.  It was amazing how much I remembered - even whole scenes of dialog.

I'll admit I DIDN'T remember quite how melodramatic it was, but it WAS kids TV circa 1977 - even had some of the same music as animated Star Trek because it was the same production company.  And Jonathan Harris seemed be having his usual fun time chewing up the scenery.  I noticed they managed not to pull too many Lost in Space comments - but Robbie the Robot DOES pop up in one episode.

The SFX and model work (which were created by some of the group who did Star Wars) do hold up pretty well, but since I went through all the episodes in two marathon sessions (Leah made me go to bed after the first DVD)  I found myself forwarding through the Seeker launching and landing sequences and the opening and closing bits.

  The show was just as much fun as I remembered though.  I DID forward through parts of one episode called ""Space Hookey"" because the scenes were just TOO silly.  The story is that Loki and Peepo (the robot) play hookey and land on a rock inside a comet that chases them - they meet two balls of light that are supposed to be ""children"" on the planet who take over Loki and when they go back to the Academy - one of them passes to Gampu (Jonathan Harris) who starts skipping around and playing pirate.  He even has Chris and Laura arrested and threatens to have them walk the plank when they try to stop him from starting a war with another race.  Their ""daddy"" finally shows up (ala ""Squire of Gothos"") and takes them away to be punished.

They also filmed a ""Back to School at the Space Academy"" documentary.  It was fun to see how Eric Greene (Loki) has turned out to be a lawyer and an activist.  Brian Tochi (Tee Gar) is still acting and Ric Carrott (Chris) has become a computer specialist.  I'd never have recognized him on the street tho.  He's changed quite a bit, but still VERY handsome.  They also spoke to one of the producers and the SFX specialist. They didn't have anything with Ty Henderson (Paul) or either of the girls Maggie Cooper (Adrian) and Pamelyn Ferdin (Laura) dunno whether they weren't able to find them or they didn't want to participate.  It's a shame - I'd have loved to see them too.

 They dedicated the documentary to Jonathan Harris and all of them seemed to have very fond memories of him.

Now waiting for my next acquisition - Ark II!",1171756800,13,2696,4.31013916500994
2682363,5,B000K4X5U8,"What is the most striking about Space Academy on this DVD set, is how good the visual effects still look. These are effects on par with any of the motion control work done on Star Wars in 1977. This is without a doubt, quality work. The Seeker spaceships are weathered down and lit with convincing shadows and darkness in some shots, and some scenes have the Seeker doing complete 360 degree turns. We're even treated to a mini fleet of Seekers in the final episode spinning 360 in unison, and firing lasers. In some aspects, the work on this series is more sophisticated than Brian Johnson's work on Space: 1999, and comes close to par quality with John Dykstra's work on Star Wars. The makers of Space Academy had a camera system more sophisticated than Brian Johnson's, and not quite as sophisticated as John Dykstra's. The Seeker's engine exhaust flares before the camera, takes off and lands convincingly from it's bay, and sits in it's bay before take-off convincingly. I have yet to see CGI spaceship work that rivals Space Academy, Space: 1999, Battlestar Galactica, or Star Wars in its realism. Though Space Academy had a low budget, I tip my hat to its technical crew for creating realistic spaceship shots that built on the era of weathered down, realistically lit spacecraft miniatures with flared engine exhaust. The innovation and imagination of Space Academy's optical effects unit produced some of the most beautifully photographed and filmed spacecraft miniatures ever put on film. This was too good to be a mere Saturday morning children's show. And the miniature of the Academy asteroid is as iconic as the ""Draconia"" from Buck Rogers, the ""Galactica"" from the ""1978 Battlestar Galactica"" series, and ""Dracos Dragonship"" from ""Jason of Star Command.""",1169510400,14,1769,4.97972972972973
2682364,5,B000K4X5U8,"Who could forget that the year Star Wars blasted its way across cinemas that Space Academy launched on CBS Saturday mornings?  The SA was a man-made planetoid built upon a large asteroid in space that was navigated by way of an interstellar star drive and commanded by Lost In Space's Dr. Smith, Jonathan Harris, who played 300 year-old Commander Isaac Gampu.  The SA contained several really cool space shuttles or ""Seekers"" that allowed them to take off-campus expeditions to nearby planets.  The Seekers were basically designed after the Ark II vehicle (minus the wheels) which had been Filmation's previous live-action Saturday morning sci-fi entry.  The culturally diverse and co-ed students attending the SA included Lt. Adrian played by Maggie Cooper, Lt. Laura Gentry played by Pamelyn Ferdin (the voice of Lucy from the Peanuts and Sally on Sealab 2020) and her brother Captain Chris Gentry played by Ric Carrott, Lt. Paul Jerome played by Ty Henderson, Tee-Gar Soom played by Brian Tochi (the voice of Leonardo in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films), and Loki played by Eric Greene along with a funky robot named Peepo (voiced by She-Ra Erika Scheimer) who looked as though he could have been the distant cousin of Buck Rogers' Twiki. The students each had some kind of special skills and abilities like telekinesis and invisibility which were attributes used to overcome hostile situations and the stories generally involved plots that included some kind of moral for kids by teaching them the consequences about making the right choices but who really cared?  For its day, this show boasted some of the best visual effects on television (cheezy by today's standards of course) with detailed scale models and stop-motion aliens.  What kid wouldn't be intrigued by this show at that age?  Bell-bottoms and blue-screens never looked so passe but for those of us who were glued to the television every Saturday morning in the 1970's should find this old-school fun and a somewhat embarrassing nostalgic trip down memory lane.

In 1978, Space Academy was revamped into the successful spin-off serial Jason of Star Command starring Craig Littler as Jason and Sid Haig as the evil space pirate Dragos and it recycled the Space Academy sets and models which became Star Command under the command of Star Trek's James Doohan and the Seekers were ""upgraded"" into the sleeker Starfire crafts.  It was mentioned that Star Command was actually a special secret section of Space Academy although there was never any crossover between the two shows.

It's hard to believe that after 30 years BCI-Eclipse will finally release the complete series on DVD featuring all 15 episodes of this rarely-seen vintage 70's Saturday morning show on 4 discs including audio commentary on two episodes ""Phantom Planet"" and  ""Countdown"" with Filmation producer Lou Scheimer and stars Ric Carrott, Brian Tochi, Eric Greene, and Special Effects Supervisor Chuck Comisky, and hosted by Andy Mangels.

For some of the Star Wars fans you will recognize some of the early work of people who became apart of the Lucas team in set design.

2682368,4,B000K4X5U8,Another great saturday morning type show. I really liked seeing Jonathan Harris in something other than Lost in Space.

2682374,3,B000K4X5U8,"Though I'd never seen this show before, it was immediately familiar in both tone and style, not to mention for Johnathan Harris' overly dramatic mug. The show stars Harris (of Lost in Space fame) as Commander Gampu of the titular Space Academy, surrounded by a very ethnically diverse cast of young actors including Ric Carrott as Chris Gentry, Pamelyn Ferdin as Laura Gentry (Chris' psyonically connected twin sister), Maggie Cooper as Adrian, Brian Tochi (voice of Leonardo in the three live action TMNT movies as well as Toshiro Takashi from the Revenge of the Nerds movies and Cadet Nogata from the Police Academy Movies) as Tee Gar, Ty Henderson as Paul, and Eric Greene as the blue haired (well black haired with a slight blue dusting) Loki, an orphan picked up in the first episode from a desolate planet that is about to explode. The other character that rounded out the show was Peepo, voiced by Erika Scheimer, daughter of Lou Scheimer (who helped found Filmation and was executive producer on most of it's shows.)

The show ran for 15 episodes on Saturday mornings in 1977 and follows the adventures of the space cadets and their Commander as they seek out and explore space from their academy space station via their Seeker space ships (which is actually the recycled Ark II craft, and would later be used on Jason of Star Command, a loose spin-off of Space Academy.) Though the show is fairly dated in terms of wardrobe and hairstyles (they certainly didn't take a cue from Star Trek in this) it's immensely enjoyable in it's kid level Star Trek homages and campy light hearted-ness. One of the shows strengths is it's decent effects work with a mixture of really good shots (like a Seeker coming in for a landing in a docking bay) and some not so great ones, but all of it is almost on par with shows like Star Trek and Space 1999.

It's hard not to smile at the bad jokes and overly dramatic lines, which make it easy to look past the implausible plots and psuedo-scientific occurrences. Watching Chris and Laura psychically conversing or when Loki uses his infrared vision to spot particles of meteor dusk on the body of a seeker has a very campy charm. The only thing that really stood and kind of bugged me was the bile inducing amount of smiling the kids did. It's almost to a point where you can read a 1984-esque environment of fear into the acting style (you almost expect some of the characters to bust out with a line like, ""Keep smiling or Gampu will kill us with his death ray."") It's the perfect Saturday morning trash though, that is a stepping-stone to the more adult shows like Battlestar Galatica or Dr. Who, and at the end of the day is a perfect example of a very important part in nostalgia, which is that there are some things that are meant only for kids, and that can be very important. You see that type of mentality in things like Lunchables that come with Pop Rocks-esque fizzy toppings, or commercials for Apple Jacks, sometimes things don't need to be anything more than they appear, they don't need to make sense, they just need to be cool for kids.

Shows like this are also a great example of something a child can use as a basis for kick starting their imagination. That's something that's lost on children's television and it's inevitable merchandising today. I truly think that this is a lost art in that by not going into large amounts of researched detail it forces a kid to fill in the gaps of logic (sort of like Donnie Darko for kids, but with less disturbing and much more scientific uncertainty), which is something that low budget or highly logic jumping shows tend to invoke.

At the end of the day, though the show is flawed, it is mindless fun (maybe too much because of it's datedness) and that's about all I want out of a Saturday morning TV show anyway.  I will say that's sparked an interest in finding out what Jason of Star Command (which centers on a special ops-like extension of Space Academy) is like.",1175904000,9,3970,4.585915492957747

8154297,5,B000K4X5U8,"This is possibly the best live action cartoon ever made. In the year 3732, young cadets attend a school in space called Space Academy. Under the guidance of Commander Gampu, played by Jonathan Harris from Lost in Space of TV fame, they meet aliens, fly spaceships, and have many adventures. Airing on CBS in 1977, this was/is a ground-breaking live-action series from the masters of Saturday mornings called Filmation, the makers of Ark 2, Freedom Force, Space Sentinels, Blackstar, Jason of Star Command, and He-Man. With INCREDIBLE SPECIAL EFFECTS from the same people who made Star Wars(you read that right!)...I am going to repeat that; this was made for TV by the same people who made Star Wars! That is why people of all ages could watch this and not feel ashamed to enjoy a Saturday morning ""kid's show"". This reminds me somewhat of Space 1999 in that Space Academy is located on a ""planetoid"" and is not a spaceship although the Academy is motor powered and very mobile. On Space 1999, they were on the moon which is not powered to move but was naturally mobile. I have been watching cartoons for over 35 years and have NEVER, to this day, seen a better live-action series made for kids and teens. NEVER. The special effects, ship models, and sets look reasonable to VERY real every episode. Look for similarities in sets to Star Wars, especially in the hallways and control rooms. If you really want to see some ""star power"", check out Jason of Star Command who stars Scotty from Star Trek as the Commander of Star Command, a ""secret section of Space Academy"". You will be shocked at the high quality of this show. Most live-action kid's shows are horrible(bad effects, bad costumes, etc.) but this one will pleasantly shock you! Filmation was well known for the best live-action ""kid's shows"" ever made and this is their masterpiece!",1423699200,,1843,4.7625

Watching it as an adult, I found it a bit lacking in the plot lines, but I think that young people today would still enjoy it because it had good life lessons about togetherness and friendship and feel good stuff like that!
The Documentary at the end of the series was very interesting, but I wish they would have showed what all the cast members looked like today. Of course, Jonathan Harris is deceased now (the series is dedicated to his memory).

The models were OK but the spaceflight sequences were awful (I remember when I was a kid watching this trying to figure out why the spaceship was skidding). And didn't they have a science advisor for this program? Watching the first disc and listening to the Space Academy definition of a ""black hole"" resulted in the only laugh I could conjure at this program. I notice that sound effects and music were recycled from Star Trek, the Animated Series. Doctor Smith With That Seventies Hair couldn't save this show.

Still, at least it's not Ark II.",1362441600,,780,4.777777777777778

8154302,4,B000K4X5U8,"When you think of influential space science fiction from the 1970s, it's essentially a given to credit Star Wars and Star Trek for their timeless influence.  You may even want to go as far as to mention Flash Gordon or the original Battlestar Galactica.  However, kids back then were actually enjoying solid science fiction television on Saturday mornings intermingled with their cartoon fix thanks to Filmation, the company who would later earn accolades with animated shows like He-Man and She-Ra.

Enter Space Academy, a show that consisted only of 15 half-hour episodes but ran on broadcast television from 1977-1979.  This show followed up on the science fiction themes introduced the previous season's (1976) Ark II and in fact went as far as to recycle the front of the Ark II ground vehicle into the commonly seen space shuttle craft used by the Academy (the Seeker).

The show centered on a group of young adults with various powers, skills, and backgrounds that came together in Space Academy, a sort of Starfleet University built directly into a meteor. Under the guidance of Commander Isaac Gampu (who is equal parts father figure, high school principle and college professor), the crew of Space Academy daily routine involves encountered new life forms, planetary exploration and civilization integration.

Chris and Laura Gentry were the main cadets as the captain and (respectively) co-captain of SA's Blue Team.  Adrian Pryce-Jones was Chris's love interest and third in command.  Fourth in the chain was Paul Jerome, an African-American transferee from Red Team.  Finally rounding out the main cast was Asian Tee Gar Soom, who, in addition to possessing medical skills, boasted super-human strength.

One of the first beings they encountered was Loki, a young orphaned alien boy with the power of invisibility who joins the cast. Finally rounding out the team in their mission was Peepo, a small robot with a slightly sassy personality (not unlike say, R2-D2 but with a human voice).

The episodes themselves operated off a reoccurring formula without ever crossing the line into becoming formulaic.  And like all children's television programming at the time, Filmation was obligated to integrate sociological morality into the prose.  Fortunately the lessons taught here were never much of a stretch nor do they feel like an after-thought.  Considering that many of the plots centered on encountering new life forms or attempting to understand political or cultural systems not of earthen origin, the opportunity to present a positive message was never far off for the show's production team.

The effects, which should theoretically be the weakest link of the Space Academy chain, are surprisingly quite solid- particularly the in-space segments.  Thanks in no small part to special effects supervisor Chuck Comisky's efforts, the space scenes are truly on par with what we might expect from the original (1977 version of) Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  In other words they hold up well even today while being completely cutting edge at the time of their broadcast!

About the weakest visuals come in the form of a few stop-motion aliens and some fairly restricted sets (particularly the outdoor environments).  However, in the show's defense, there was a very deliberate effort to focus the core of each episode on solid story-telling; the type of material that does not require (or depend upon) visual gimmicks to be entertaining- in a sense, the complete opposite of the current Hollywood trend of releasing films that are devoid of substance but rife with computer-generated effects.

Plots and pacing could actually be pretty closely compared to the original Star Trek series in that rather than simply rely upon the ideals of the vastness of space/advanced technology, the viewer is treated to a human-driven, almost personal tale that just so happens to take place in a scientifically-solid futuristic environment.

While my review of this property may seem strangely past due (after all, after 28 years of lying dormant, the official DVD release happened back on January 16 2007 by a company that has since gone under itself), my reasoning is that since Navarre has actually gone in and rescued several of BCI Entertainment's orphaned titles for release (among these the 2002 He-Man collection and the animated Dungeons & Dragons series), there is hope they will pick up Filmation's live action shows as well.
I happen to have secured a copy of the 2007 BCI release, which, though becoming increasingly hard to find, still exists in the marketplace in some capacity.  Should you happen upon the 4-disc set (shown in photo), it is quite rife with special features and each of the 15 episodes is digitally remastered.  Among the goodies included:

In conclusion, I came away from Space Academy both pleasantly surprised and thoroughly convinced of its influence as a stepping-stone to what is considered contemporary science fiction.  While I'm not diluted enough to suspect today's CGI-charged youth will be able to overlook the technological limitations of the era in effort to appreciate the tight writing or positive message within, I can state with certainty that modern science fiction fan aficionados will find much to enjoy through this brief look into a more innocent time.  And those individuals who remember the program during its original broadcast era will undoubtedly cherish every moment of this collection.",1270339200,,5894,5.229299363057325

He must have been in constant disbelief that he was picked for the show! Ha! The acting is a bit weak and the sound effects are recycled from numerous other filmation productions, but the models and effects definitely stand out. The stages for planetside scenes look like they were robbed straight from the Lost in Space set! As far as the transfer, the colors really POP! on these new LCD screens.
