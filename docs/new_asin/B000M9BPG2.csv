2727448,5,B000M9BPG2,This is my favorite biblical movie!  Omar Sharif was perfect with the cast. I first saw it in Italian in Rai TV and was the first to get it on DVD with Portugese subtitles.  This is my second purchase as I loaned my lst one to a priest who shares it with the children of his school and I just couldn't ask for it back.  One of my favorite many scenes is Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus and of course Peter crying in Jesus' arms for denying him three times.  There are so many but I'll just say get it share it and enjoy!,1176595200,72,530,3.9716981132075473
2727449,5,B000M9BPG2,Enjoyed this movie alot. I bought it based on the 2 reviews on this site and after seeing it I agree with their reviews. Omar does a magnificent job as Peter. I recognized the actor that played Judas in Passion of the Christ as Matthias in St. Peter. After seeing this movie I can see why Jesus gave Peter the keys to heaven. Noone that has ever lived deserves it more than him.,1175731200,13,378,4.191780821917808
2727450,5,B000M9BPG2,"I have seen many movies about the Apostle Paul. This movie is the most accurate about Peter that I've ever seen. As my wife ans I watched it, we both said that this movie truly follows the New Testament about Peter's life. I reccomend this movie wholeheartedly. It would be a great movie for church congregations to watch together. Gary",1174348800,79,336,4.616666666666666
2727451,5,B000M9BPG2,"Excellent Movie, this movie taught me so much about the Apostles Peter, Paul and how they came to KNOW that Jesus Christ was son of God and the relationship Christ had with them.  I cried, Omar Sharif was a perfect Peter, as his eyes express so much of the feelings that were experienced when he denied Christ (3) times and also told him he loved him (3) times.  The pace of the movie is excellent, the acting superb, and most of all the historical representation (especially the Romans and the Christians),in this cinematic film captures the essence of Christ, and how those closest to him came to KNOW he was son of God and how the Holy Spirit touched those Christians after his resurecction.  I would highly recommend this film!",1170720000,123,731,4.607692307692307
2727452,5,B000M9BPG2,"This movie I first saw in Italian from RAI TV via satelite, it reached me, touched me, gave me faith and hope that Jesus will be there when it all happens again.  Omar Sharif has the same dewy emotion coming from his eyes that he did in Dr Zhivago when he looked out that broken window calling for Lara, he did an incredible job as St. Peter. The actor who plays the apostle Paul has such a transformation after the conversion on the road to Damascus that even looks physical, amazing.

I prayed to God for a copy of this movie in English so I could have it and watch it with my new husband. I asked for it to somehow reach me for my Christmas present from God (not santa claus) and LO & Behold I felt moved to check here at Amazon and there it was!!! ONE single copy in English! Unbelievable!

I will now pray for there to be many more becoming available because this story of the ACTS of the apostles is one that I have never seen made into a movie and what a movie it is!

Don't miss it, buy it, if you love our God you will watch it over and over again.

[...]God bless.",1167523200,3,1074,4.047169811320755
2727453,5,B000M9BPG2,"Watching this movie makes you realized how St. Peter devoted himself to all Jesus followers and how he loved Jesus. Although,no one knows the real story of our dear St. Peter,but we're all sure that he was a good person to everyone. He was so devoted spreading God's words. Yes,he made few mistakes but those mistakes has designed by God to makes him realize how important love and peace to all of us.",1502841600,2,401,4.506849315068493
2727454,4,B000M9BPG2,"I must agree with the first reviewer Mr Henri. We are watching a movie based on the bible, which is TRUTH. Why would They take what is true and make it false? Mark gave a perfect example regarding Saul. Those who know the good book know Saul was a horrible person. Chess stopped him dead in his tracks and asked, ""Saul, Saul why are you persecuting me""?
He was blinded and then cured . He changed his name and became ""Paul"", St Paul. Why the writer changed one of the most memorable , important parts of God's word boggles my mind.  If for no other reason then the stern warning God gave in the book of Revelation to anyone with audacity to add or take away from his word. I ask , what purpose it served to
change it? I loved the actors and most of the movie but not all of it.",1502755200,,777,4.078431372549019

2727456,3,B000M9BPG2,"I'm going to take the middle. Yes, it will inspire. No, it was not entirely accurate and had some flaws both theologically and with the presentation of the characters. For example, Saul did not go to the disciples to learn about Jesus. Instead, he was given divine insight and immediately began to preach the gospel. I found the acting a little wooden at times. As happens often, the book was better ;-)",1502409600,2,403,4.611111111111111

2727458,5,B000M9BPG2,Beautiful well done movie about the first pope and the beginning of the Church founded by Christ.,1502064000,,97,4.764705882352941
2727459,3,B000M9BPG2,"Anyone who knows their Bible knows that this movie has only snippets of accuracy.  It is quite apparent that the movie producers and writers have massaged the Biblical story of Peter and his role in the early church to fit the Roman Catholic Church narrative.  All you have to do is read the book of Acts to understand that Peter fades off the scene quite early and Paul takes the lead as the main character in the formation of the early church.  In fact, if you study the portion in Acts (which correlates with Galations) about the ""Jerusalem Council"", where Paul meets with the Apostles who were chosen by Christ, to discuss the message of grace he had been preaching to the Gentiles, you will recognize that Peter and the twelve were to take the gospel to the Jews, as Paul was to take his gospel of grace to the Gentiles.  As Paul says in the book of Romans; he was the Apostle to the GENTILES.

Unfortunately, the Roman Catholic Church has built their entire theology on the WRONG Apostle!!  But Peter better fits their works-based system of salvation since Peter was still adhering to the Mosaic law... as any good Jew at that time would do.  Thus, the Reformation was necessary so many years later to restore Paul's gospel of grace through faith in the death, burial and resurrection of Christ that the Roman Catholic Church repressed in their hierarchical stranglehold on Christian thought for the first 1500 years!  PAUL's MESSAGE is the foundation of the Christian Church.... NOT PETER'S MESSAGE!!  Paul's message (the ""mysteries"") about the Church as the Body of Christ and salvation by grace through faith was received by him first (by Christ Himself)... he wasn't taught it by anyone, including the 12 Apostles!  Thus, the very reason for the Jerusalem Council, because the 12 Apostles and the believing Jews were incredulous about Paul's authority as an Apostle of Christ and his message to the Gentiles about being saved by grace through faith.... plus NOTHING... not baptism; not circumcision; not law keeping, etc., etc.

So, although the movie got some things right; most notably the fact that Peter could not go to the Gentiles until Christ's vision to him about the sheet with 4 corners (completely absent in this movie) instructing him to go to Cornelius's house (a Gentile believer) to share with him the gospel of the Kingdom of Christ.  Peter's gospel message to Cornelius was different than Paul's... it was the gospel of the Kingdom, not Paul's message of Grace.... however, God saw fit to send Peter to share his gospel with Cornelius, making him the FIRST Gentile convert to be saved and to receive the Holy Spirit (contrary to most who believe that Gentiles were part of the church prior to this event... even during Christ's earthly ministry!).  This event,  Cornelius's conversion, happened 14 years prior to the Jerusalem Council.  Paul's gospel of God's grace and his teaching carries the main weight of gospel truth for today, not Peter's gospel of the Kingdom.  It is unfortunate that most Christians and nearly all Catholics fail to realize this.

I give the movie 3 stars for dramatic content, for great acting by the actor who played Peter, and for at least getting some things right, and for elevating the truth that Jesus is the Christ and Son of God and only through Him is salvation.  It could have been a great, great movie if not for the Roman Catholic bias that alters the truth about Peter's status and role in the early church, and the insistence that Peter was the main thrust of leadership in the early church's formation.  But how else could they justify their belief in Apostolic Succession and in making Peter the first ""Pope""??  .... a total aberration of New Testament Scripture.  ...Sorry to all you Roman Catholics, but it is true.  I still love you Catholics... I was one myself ...  please read your Bible and prove me wrong... I dare you! ;)",1502064000,5,3900,4.770833333333333

2727461,5,B000M9BPG2,"This was a wonderful inspiring movie based on the life of Jesus and the apostle Peter. When we as people can see the things of our faith depicted on film it adds so much more to our lives. I appreciate that the film stayed close to the word of God. Of course we can only imagine what life was actually like back then but when we get to hear the actual word of God being spoken, it is as the film says, to hear Jesus's voice is like a flame in your heart that NEVER goes out! BRAVO to the actors, Producers and all who undertook the endeavor!! May God BLESS you all...and everyone who watches this film. I know I was blessed. Thank you.",1501977600,,635,4.088

2727463,4,B000M9BPG2,"Apparently reusing the sets of the 'Rome' TV show, this is a spiritual sequel to the 1977 Jesus of Nazareth production, which was also characterized by the arrangement of a strong and moving central performance (then, from Robert Powell) in the midst of overdubbed actors of lesser caliber. Consider the strength of the central message, and it seems appropriate to forgive the production its faults.

The life of Peter, as with 'Jesus of Nazareth', is augmented slightly beyond what's recorded in Acts and the New Testament, but, as with the 1977 production, this is done with respect for the heart of the material and in the spirit of the message with which the story deals. Omar Sharif commits himself fully to the role of the founder of the Christian church, and makes an enduring impression. The re-used settings and scene dressings from 'Rome' give the tale a scope that such a production probably could not have afforded otherwise.",1501718400,,937,4.930379746835443

2727466,1,B000M9BPG2,Some people should not be allowed to take liberties with the Bible such as those taken in this movie.  I through it up to the point of it showing them pouring water over the heads as baptism.  There is no mention of pouring as being acceptable for baptism.  The very word baptizmo in Greek means immersion.  There were over liberties that I chose to overlook but this one I just couldn't.  So I quit.,1501372800,,400,4.351351351351352
2727467,5,B000M9BPG2,A beautiful moving story about Jesus and Peter.  I highly recommend.,1501372800,,68,5.181818181818182
2727468,3,B000M9BPG2,"The acting was good, but the movie was not true to the Bible.  I especially noted the way of baptism, which was not immersion as described in the scriptures. We are buried in Christ through the act of water immersion. There were many other untruths in the movie, and at the end when they showed Rome and the Vatican this had no place in the movie.  Peter himself said not to bow to him because he was only a man, and yet many times people knelt as if kissing the ring of the pope. Peter was not chosen to be crucified as a second, Jesus.  Jesus did not come to Peter, and say that He had to be crucified again through Peter.  There is only one man crucified for our sins, and it wasn't Peter. Crucifixion was also a typical way that Romans killed criminals in that day.  Peter, the man, the apostle asked to be crucified upside down because he did not feel worthy to be crucified in the same was as our Lord. Peter was a strong, Christian man and apostle.  When Peter spoke the truth about Jesus being the Son of God, and Jesus then said ""upon this rock I will build my church"" Jesus was referring to building His church on the truth of Peter's confession.  Jesus called Peter, the rock because He knew that Peter would be a strong advocate for the faith, and a leader for the apostles.  The best part of this movie was Omar Sharif's portrayal of Peter, there are not many actors like him.",1501286400,,1389,4.254752851711027
2727469,1,B000M9BPG2,Not biblically accurate.  Dubbing not in sync.,1501286400,2,46,5.571428571428571
2727470,5,B000M9BPG2,"Omar Sharif is brilliant as the Apostle Peter. Johannes Brandrup (Paul the Apostle) plays Jesus.

2727471,1,B000M9BPG2,"Terrible in so many ways.  Very poor acting.  Omar Sharif was never a great actor, but he did have screen presence.  Here he shows none of that.  To go from Doctor Zhivago and Funny Girl to this is a terrible come-down for him.  The dubbing was laughable, out of sync, and with bad pronunciations.  Despite how bad Sharif is in this, his acting is better than the others, who appear to be confused extras mouthing lines.  The story is not even in keeping with the Bible, at least as I remember it.  I could not take more than 40 minutes of this travesty.",1500854400,,554,4.310679611650485
2727472,2,B000M9BPG2,This movie has some very touching moments especially when it shows the disciples expressing the joy that Jesus is risen and is alive. However it does have some biblical timing issues and inaccuracies. It is still worth watching for what it does get right when it does. As with most Bible movies it is best to have your Bible open so that you may know the real truth rather than some filmmakers best intentions and good wishes.,1500681600,2,426,4.545454545454546

2727503,5,B000M9BPG2,"Omar Sharif stars as devoted disciple Peter in director Guilio Base's TV movie entitled,""St. Peter"" - a look at the tension that arose between the Christians and Romans following the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

As a dedicated follower of Christ, Peter spreads the message of the Christians across the land, often staying only one step ahead of those determined to persecute him. As the tension between the Christians and the Romans grows, blood runs in the streets and the apostles lose St. Paul to crucifixion. On the road to Damascus,he comes face-to-face with a stranger who shows him the only way wherein he must put himself on the cross in order to bring peace to Rome.

It was a great movie despite being more than 3 hours. It tells a story mainly of Peter. Aside from that,it also tells the story of the early Christians particularly the apostles,disciples and the risen Jesus. It may not be a powerful film but it still works as we get to appreciate Peter and his works. Sharif was perfect in the title role.",1416787200,,1029,4.679558011049724

2727510,3,B000M9BPG2,"St. Peter was a disappointment in terms of Scriptural accuracy and overly long. The fiction added to the account of the Apostle Peters life was pure torture and I had to force myself to watch the entire 197 minute film. While some Scripture was paraphrased from the book of Acts, the Gospels of John and Mark as well as some of Pauls epistles and used in the dialogue, it was jumbled up in time and place. There was also heavy emphasis on Roman Catholic doctrine throughout the movie which may be expected as it was an Italian production. But at times Peter was portrayed seemingly greater than our Lord. Many of the Biblical details were incorrect. For example, baptisms were shown being done with cups of water rather than full immersion as described in the Bible (see Matthew 3:16, Acts 8:39 for examples). The story of the Roman centurion Corneliuss conversion, which is very important as it is the first time a gentile was baptized into Christ, was totally botched. That scene did not mention or show Peters dream on the rooftop in Joppa were the Lord told him, ""What God has made clean, do not call common."" (Acts10:15b). The scene depicting this biblical episode had them running into each other on the street, when Cornelius was actually 35 or so miles away in Caesarea and had a vision telling him to send for Peter. (Acts 10:1). Then there is the little detail of Peters wife. One would never know that Peter was married (Mark 1:30) from the movie. Another area that bothered me was Paul going to Rome almost immediately after his dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. In the Biblical account Paul does not get to Rome until his 4th missionary journey, and only after spreading the Gospel throughout Asia Minor and Greece, establishing many churches along the way. Also, when they are together in Rome, Peter tells Paul to appeal to Caesar when he is in prison. But it was Paul himself who appealed to Caesar before he ever went to Rome (Acts 25:11). While the movie was stylish, the sets and costumes well done, and I admire Omar Sharif (the other actors were inferior) one could almost do as well from an accuracy standpoint watching Demetrius and the Gladiators. If you are looking for pure entertainment and enjoy epics, then buy the movie. If on the other hand, you are seeking a genuine portrayal of the Apostles life, beware this film.",1407542400,4,2359,4.673076923076923

2727557,3,B000M9BPG2,"I understand the criticism on the acting in this film.  The movies does start out really lame, until the introduction of Pauls' quest to hunt the Christians.
  Not enough power was shown in Pauls' conversion when Jesus spoke to him, but this was probably due to budget constraints. Omar Sherife, played Peter exceptionally well, I could really feel his compassion for all of Gods people, including the Pegans that Jesus wanted Peter to convert.  I noticed Omar Sherife shines better when he has a descent actor to play against or with.  The actor playing Perseus' son did a fine job, as well did the man who played the Gladiator who was wrestling with his forced killing of Gladiators, and his faith as a Christian. Overall Omar Sherife Carried this movie, his portrayal of Peter was very compassionate, and understanding.  When Peter was conflicted with his desire to leave Rome, and return to his family, and Christ had to appear to him, to remind him of who and what he really is, and who he serves, Omar pulled these scenes off Brilliantly. Overall I enjoyed this movie because Omar Sherrife captured the character and compassion of Peter perfectly, I really believed that Omars, Peter had the Holey Spirit.",1351209600,,1211,4.826086956521739

2727559,5,B000M9BPG2,"Omar Sharif is a brilliant actor. He has humanized Peter, with  faults & frailties. Wonderful movie for the family. I think most of us think of the apostles as almost super human. Some of them had wives/ children and worked very hard to keep it together as we do today. As the movie showed, some of them even had great differences of opion. Because they were not learned men, I think that's why they were chosen.",1344384000,4,412,4.421052631578948
2727560,5,B000M9BPG2,"Not perfect, but this is the best and most comprehensive film on St. Peter's life that I have ever seen. It has good music and beautiful photography. It is also fast-moving enough to keep teenagers interested. Less stodgy than ""Quo Vadis"" from the 1950s and less talky than ""Peter and Paul"" with Anthony Hopkins, this is the sort of movie that takes the BORING out of Bible. Omar Sharif is also the best Peter on film, conveying an intensity of contrition and humble love for Christ that carries this movie and distinguishes Sharif from the slightly self-righteous portrayals of actors who play the role in other films. He wisely makes Peter more real and relatable by emphasizing the character's weakness and self-doubts rather than his pride. It helps that the screenplay is nicely balanced to cover several phases of Peter's life. The movie's first half is loosely based on the ""Acts of the Apostles,"" while the second half follows Paul's letters and the historical traditions surrounding the fate of Peter in Rome. Unfortunately, the English voices on this Italian import are too obviously dubbed, sounding artificial at times. I also found myself wishing for more biblical material from Paul's letters and less fictionalized melodrama in the film's second half. But these are minor quibbles in a film that does more justice to Peter in himself than any previous movie. As you continue to watch the film, it's hard to look away from the beautiful scenes, making the acting and screenplay into minor distractions at best. The screenplay offers fresh interpretations on scenes from the Acts of the Apostles, while the acting offers clearly telegraphed emotions which lift the film beyond a mere Sunday school lesson. Stylistically, the director Giulio Base seems to favor the beauty of religious experiences over the talkiness/preachiness that infects much of this genre. This movie is filled with ""good scenes"" which carry the viewer along despite himself. Some of the most beautiful scenes include the opening shots of Christ and Peter, the empty tomb at the resurrection, Peter swimming to Jesus on the shore, the conversion of Paul, the apostles traveling the world to preach, the gospel flashbacks with Christ and Jesus throughout the film, Paul's trial and execution scenes, the gladiatorial scenes, the Lord's supper led by Peter, the ""Quo Vadis"" moment near the film's end, Peter's crucifixion, and the surprising final shot. If you love the Peter of the Bible, whose personality comes through very strongly here, you'll find it easy to love this film and to excuse its technical faults.",1343865600,5,2597,5.0843091334894615

Jesus told Peter he was the ""rock"" but he seemed more like a ""sponge""! I have watched this movie many times and as yet feel it's worthy of the man who plays the title.

However, you will not enjoy it if you do not already have a great love of St. Peter, our first Pope.  Some of the voices are obviously dubbed, much of the plot created out of thin air.  It is sentimental, and ""devout"" in the Catholic sense of the word.

Peter is portrayed very much in keeping with the feel of his New Testament letters.  Kind, fatherly, full of compassion and understanding, with deep remorse for his denials of Jesus on the night of the Last Supper.  The over-all message is one of forgiveness for human weakness and hope for the future.",1288137600,8,623,4.3652173913043475

Sharif plays Peter as we know him in Scripture: impetuous, doubting, convicted, scared and ultimately faithful.  And he does it with extraordinary sobriety, passion and reserve.  Any historian can argue the ""facts"" of this movie, but you have to be a real cynic to argue against the message.  This is a compelling and sympathetic treatment of the spread of Christianity after the passion, death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus.

2727618,2,B000M9BPG2,"I read the reviews.  I wanted to believe the good ones and ignore the bad ones. I should have listened to Fr. Ambrose.  Omar Sharif is a great actor, but too much of the movie differs from the true events in the Acts of the Apostles.  A little ad-lib is acceptable, but this movie changes events, invents situations which are almost heretical, and is simply not as moving as other biblical movies, such as Jesus of Nazareth.  The Bible is plenty interesting, why change it?  We actually couldn't finish watching it because every few minutes my husband and I were looking at each other with a ""that's not the way it happened"" expression.  One example is having Saint Peter see Jesus disguised as a beggar before Mary Magdalene comes to tell them of the Resurrection.  Later, some of the apostles are not in the room for the Pentecost, yet they still get the gift of Holy Spirit and are able to speak and understand other languages.  The Bible clearly says they were all gathered in one room.  Is this being too particular?  For some maybe, but for us watching the movie with our children, we didn't want to have to keep interrupting the movie to say, ""That's not the way it happened.""",1236384000,74,1183,4.537735849056604

2727620,2,B000M9BPG2,"First of all, this movie has one part in it that makes the movie worthy of watching once: Paul's conversion. The part where he reveals himself as a new follower of Christ to the other disciples bought tears to my eyes. But that's as good as it gets. The parts before and after were laughable b/c not only did they inaccurately portray scripture, but 2 of the actors chosen didn't look believable while they portrayed their roles. I mean, John the Apostle looked extremely feminine and much like Jake Gyllenhal. And when I think of Jake Gyllenhal, I immediately think of Brokeback Mountain. Not a good thing to think of during a religious film. The man who portrayed Christ looked like a tough guy who wouldn't think twice about beating you to a pulp for looking at him wrong. And call me crazy, but I just don't envision a loving, kindhearted Christ w/ a face resembling Clint Eastwood meets Arnold Shwartzenegger meets Gary Sinese in a bad mood. Also, the movie was dubbed horribly. The most laughable part of the movie was Peter's death, which isn't funny at all under normal circumstances, but was hilarious in this movie. Why? B/c during his crucifixion, he had on what looked like an insanely oversized Depends adult diaper, and nothing else. But the most hilarious part of it was the fact that his friend's, fellow disciples, and family were LITERALLY standing inches away FROM HIS FACE, looking at him while the soldier's nailed his hands to the cross and he slowly died. And they did it w/ no emotion whatsoever! I mean, doesn't it seem funny to you that a disciple of Christ was screaming and moaning in pain during his crucifixion, while his friends and family literally watched him die a few inches away? I mean, the soldiers almost didn't have enough room to nail his hands to the cross since they were standing so close! Geez! Overall, I would watch this film again b/c of the part of Paul's conversion, but that's about it. It was that bad!",1205971200,10,1954,4.63400576368876

2727624,1,B000M9BPG2,"Like another reviewer, we watched the movie for a little over an hour before turning it off in disgust.  It was so bad in so many different ways:
We all felt the acting and especially the dubbing so bad to be laughable. The Delivery was totally off; no emotion at all and mis-Pronunciation of key words in the Bible, e.g. Pilate and Sanhedrin come to mind.
Any one who has read ""The Book"" will not appreciate the liberties they have taken:  The centurion who pierced Jesus' side, The charge of Peter to ""tend the flock"", St. Paul and Pilate, key characters being introduced too early, etc. etc. etc.
""Jesus of Nazareth"" is on a totally different plane has far as I am concerned.  Now that was a great movie.  Very moving and very uplifting.  ""St. Peter"", on the other hand, lacks everything that made ""Jesus of Nazareth"" great.  The movie has no spirit, I was not moved by the miracles, the modern Bible translation is terrible, and there are too many deviations from the Bible itself.",1200873600,18,985,4.568181818181818
2727625,1,B000M9BPG2,"This movie failed on seemingly every possible point.

First, the quality of the film-making was low. On the DVD I had, not only was the audio out of sync with the video, a lot of the time, the audio and the subtitle didn't match the words the actors mouths were forming. Maybe this is a minor issue, but it seems to me that much of Christian film falls short on basic technical issues. Come on! How hard is it to simply do it right?

Second, the acting was pretty bad. Why is it that Christian ""deep thinking"" is always shown as horribly cheesy and melodramatic? Why can't we portray accurately the events described in the New Testament as well as Hollywood portrays their stories of sin and debauchery? Why can't righteousness or holiness look realistic?

Third, why can't we simply use the Bible as the authoritative script for any movies ""based"" on the Bible? I understand that there must be ""filler"" details that aren't to be found in the Bible, but does that mean that it's OK to blatantly contradict scripture? My wife and I turned off the movie about an hour and a half into it (which, by the way, it LESS THAN HALF of the way into the movie), and here are some simple ways in which the script deviates from scripture:

1. When Mary Magdalene comes to tell Peter and John that Jesus is gone, the movie portrays her as smiling to herself, as if she secretly suspects that Jesus is risen. In fact, John 20 clearly shows that Mary returns to the tomb, AFTER Peter and John, and is still weeping. She mistakes Jesus for the gardener, and only when he reveals Himself to her does her sorrow turn to joy.

2. The movie shows Jesus coming down the stairs (into the UPPER room, by the way) to reveal Himself to the disciples gathered there. John 20 clearly shows that the room was locked and the disciples were hiding in fear. Therefore, many people reasonably claim that Jesus simply appeared in their midst. Why not use that in the script?

3. Why was scripture not used for Peter's sermon at Pentecost? What he said in the movie didn't seem to be close to what Acts says that he said.

4. From where do the movie's script writers get the collusion between Saul (Paul) and Pilate? In fact, where do they get the story of Paul selling tents to Pilate? That seems a great stretch to me, especially given the clear zeal that Saul/Paul had as a Jew.

5. God's vision to Peter showing him both that the Jewish dietary restrictions were lifted and that God's gospel was meant for the Gentiles as well as Jews took place on a rooftop. Why contradict that in the movie?

6. The movie shows Paul submitting himself to Peter and asking Peter and the other disciples to teach him about Jesus' words. Galatians 1 CLEARLY shows that not only was Paul not taught the gospel by any man, but Paul EXPLICITLY states that he did not go up to those who were at Jerusalem, but went away into the desert. How can a Christian movie BLATANTLY contradict scripture?

At this point, my wife and I despaired of this movie providing any positive effect, so we turned it off.

Please don't watch this movie. It is inaccurate and poorly made. You'll do better to simply get an audio version of the New Testament and listen to the actual version of what happened.",1200268800,29,3234,4.455160744500846
2727626,4,B000M9BPG2,"Folks, this is yet another jewel by Italian Radio TV (RAI), a 2005 production abouot the life of St. Peter, starring Omar Sharif.

The good thing about this movie is that it portrays the origin and growth of the primitive Church in a manner that is credible and entertaining. The miraculous, when it occurs at all, is portrayed very soberly, matter-of-factly and prosaic. You will find no ""faith healing"" scenes or fiery preachers screaming hell and damnation, emotional repression, and the like. No, you will find a ""band of brothers"" led by a fisherman who learned to love first hand in the school of the Nazarene who once was dead and now, is alive.

St. Peter is ably portrayed by Omar Sharif, which I find a surprising choice because he's a Muslim. Sharif has had to suffer a bit for his choice of movie making. According to the Wikipedia, Sharif was born Michel Demitri Chalhoub in Alexandria, Egypt to Joseph Chalhoub, a timber merchant, and Claire (Saada), an Egyptian. The British news daily The Guardian reported back in 2005 ""that a message on a web forum used in the past by al-Qaida had a link to a site carrying the threat. 'Omar Sharif has stated that he has embraced the crusader idolatry,' it said. 'He is a crusader who is offending Islam and Muslims and receiving applause from the Italian people. I give you this advice, brothers, you must kill him.' Other messages posted to the site had protested at the appeal. The Guardian's article also highlighted Sharif's current ""unbeliever"" credentials.

Nevertheless, art is art and Sharif is an artist. His portrayal of St. Peter was of one of a strong, yet meek man. We don't get the sense of choleric angst we perceive in other portrayals of the Fisherman, such as the one portrayed by James Farentino in the 1977 miniseries, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, Sharif plays St. Peter as a man in search of love, true Christ-like love who then finds himself in the awesome and quite undeserved position of having to confer, define, and defend that love for thousands of others.

In a book I read awhile back, Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God by Jack Miles, I found an interesting thought. If a Person was born in this world and has nothing else in his calendar but one single appointment, and has an urgent message to share and only two years to do it, who will he choose to carry his message? Well, the answer is, anybody. Anybody would do, no matter how rustic his or her background or how culture. Anyone would do and that's what he did. He chose nobodies. These nobodies went ahead and changed the world by the power of their example and their speech, no swords, no invasions, no machinations with the high and mighty, no jihads, and no forced conversions. It was just themselves, the power of their idea, and the promise by the One that he ""will be with them until the end of the world"" and that's forever. St. Peter successfully captures the essence of the kerygma and its power to convince, change minds and convert.

Directed by Giulio Base, the movie has several scenic and signature moments. One of my favorites is when Peter, guided by Paul, meets the Christians in Antioch. He is taken to a second story hallway that opens like a balcony into an inner courtyard. Down in the courtyard you see the Christians of Antioch acclaiming him. Sharif affects a John Paul the Great gesture and raises his two hands slightly in front of him to greet them back as he smiles to them. The moment looks completely Papal and explains the spiritual attraction Catholics feel for the Bishop of Rome not necessarily because who he is personally, rather, because he is Peter. The scenes of Peter's martyrdom look like the paintings one might find in an old family Bible or in a Missal. They were beautifully done. The transition to a surprising finale was exquisite, going a long way to explain in pictures what we Catholic Christians believe and why regarding the person of St. Peter.

I just have one less-than-good thing to say about this movie and that is at times it becomes formulaic. The movie contains various subplots, one of them the love story between the good-hearted yet conflicted pagan man and the devoted, yet strong Christian woman. I saw this same subplot in another movie from these series I reviewed before, The Apocalypse - Starring Richard Harris. I suppose that I should expect these subplots but that doesn't mean I should like them. Nevertheless, these don't subtract anything from the movie's main premise.

St. Peter is worth your time and money. It is ideal for family viewing or watch with friends at home or at church. It can also become a good catechetical tool about the power and the meaning of Christian Love, a central theme in Pope Benedict's first encyclical. It can also be a great apologetic proof against those who thing impossible or highly unlikely that St. Peter every made it to Rome, much less becoming what we Catholics said he became: the first in a long line of very human men who are witnesses to the Resurrection of Christ.

2727634,3,B000M9BPG2,"I've got to admit that has a Bible scholar, I thought the first half of the movie followed the New Testament story about Peter (in the four gospels) fairly accurately, including the story of Peter in the Book of Acts.  Omar Sharif portrayed Peter better than any other Peter I have seen in Hollywood-style movies.  The location shots in Tunisia almost made me feel like I was in first century Palestine, especially the Lake Galilee segments.

As I recall, Peter was married, but nowhere in the movie is there any indication or mention of it.  The scene with the Day of Pentecost was very interesting to behold, and the screenplay by Salvatore Basile excellently avoids the controversial issue of glossalalia (speaking in tongues).

The issue of Paul versus Peter is treated gently, and Paul's anti-Jewish stance (acceptance of eating with Gentiles) contrasts beautifully with Peter's initial reluctance to accept Gentiles into the fold, but then reconsidering the message of love as told by the Savior.

The use of ""LIGHT"" to display the enlightening moments in the movie is superb: the resurrected Christ appears in a light-form, light descends on Peter as he blesses Cornelius (the centurion), Paul is blinded by the light, Peter experiences the risen Christ as a voice and a light in a dream-vision, and many other examples.

Every time Peter (Omar Sharif) remembers Christ, it's always as a living memory:  ""a voice that stays inside you;""  ""it is Jesus who guides our steps;"" ""we must act with our hearts, as Jesus taught us.""  A dramatic point in the story is when Peter takes the disciples to the boat and illustrates how they must all stick together if they are to spread the gospel; they must each hold the handle that steers the boat, and the metaphorical boat they must steer will unite them as brothers as they sail through calm and stormy waters.

The characters that portray the disciples are very believable, displaying human emotions and desires.

Chronology is interesting:  ""Antioch, some time later; Rome, years later.""  The resurrection and ascension seem to take place within a 24-hour period (as implied in the Gospels of Mark and Luke).

Where the story seems to take a turn into church tradition -- instead of what is actually found in the New Testament -- is where the disciples are sent to different countries (India, Egypt, etc).  That takes place in Chapter 11 (about 1hr 30minutes into the movie).  Paul is seen in Rome talking about the story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery. When someone asks him about what his voice was like, Paul answers, ""It's like a flame in the heart that keeps on burning.""  Here also Peter turns old, and Mary Magdalene (who plays a minor role) takes care of him.  And then Mark arrives from Rome to tell Peter that Paul is waiting for him in Rome, and that people in Rome want to meet him.  So Mark takes Peter to Rome.  The rest of the movie is totally apocryphal (taken from apocryphal literature), including the beheading of Paul, and the upside-down cross that Peter dies on (in Chapter 21).

There is a prolonged romance in Rome between Claudius and Sylvia, which could have been deleted--but Hollywood needed romance!  And there are gladiator scenes (ala Hollywood).  What happens in Rome during the second half of the movie is Hollywood's (and probably the Vatican's) depiction of what most people now accept as what probably happened to Paul and Peter in Rome.  As far as the movie goes, that almost seems like a continuation of the Book of Acts (according to Hollywood/Vatican).  So what the writer didn't tell the reader in the Book of Acts, the movies decided to tell us!

 So remember, even good biblical movies are in the end ""historical fiction.""",1177977600,13,3726,4.816037735849057

That, along with the horrible music editing and almost constant background music being at least a couple of volume levels too loud, makes this movie very, very hard to watch.  While Peter's life and influence is important to Christian history, the many, many biblical inaccuracies of this movie are also distractions that can't be ignored.  According to the Bible, Peter never was in Rome.  Some scholars think that when the scripture references say Babylon, they actually refer to Peter being in Rome, but others make a pretty good argument for Babylon meaning Babylon.  The Apostle Paul was in Rome for sure, but there is no account of him being beheaded.  He was assumed to be mayrted in that way, because he was a Roman citizen and therefore would not have been crucified. The ""sprinkling"" scenes are also very annoying.  Since to baptize literally means to immerse.  I think all the early Chistians were immersed, not ""sprinkled"".  That tradition of the Catholic church came much later.
