8685046,1,B00OUF4SR2,"Sheldon Marcus (Nicholas Gourdine) is a shy geeky poorly dressed computer genius who works for $12.50 answering phones. One night when media mogul Jonathan Xander (Dylan Christian) is publicly speaking for free to about a crowd of a dozen people, Sheldon interrupts and shows him that he is wrong. Xander sabotages Sheldon's life and forces him to work for him making in an hour what he used to earn in a week. Sheldon is supposed to run a social web site where people air their political views, are categorized, placed in groups of like people and are specifically marketed to, and possibly manipulated. Jonathan is a mover and shaker with all the world's power at his fingertips...At least I think that was the plot.

Jonathan is a crazy, a bit like Brad Pitt in ""12 Monkeys"" crazy. He is a heavy drinker, rubs his nose like he does coke, hurts people, and can't act. The supporting cast likewise had bad actors. The dialogue was fairly bad as the message of the film of media dominance controlling democratic outcome is lost. The only person who had decent lines was the air headed girlfriend which went something like this....""She said I was antagonistic, I told her I am not antagonistic, I'm a Baptist. She is so stupid."" I did like the film when she was on the screen.

In additional to questionable acting, the low budget prevented decent sound equipment. The indoor sound had an faint echo to it. For a media millionaire, Jonathan had a modest office and staff. The plot loses the message.
