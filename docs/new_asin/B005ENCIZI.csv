4666943,5,B005ENCIZI,Finally we can easily get a copy of Gamera 3 without paying 50-80 bucks for the crummy DVD. So how does the Blu-ray stack up? Well actually! Video is better than the DVD although not perfect. The transfer is grainy and has a lot of noise but it is a delight to see in HD quality. The sound? Perfect! 10 out of 10 on the Japanese DTS soundtrack. This is well worth the small pricetag and is truly a great finish to an amazing trilogy!,1317427200,2,433,4.105882352941176
4666944,5,B005ENCIZI,"I just pre-ordered mine today, so happy they are releasing this on blue ray and for an incredible cheap price, dvds of this are selling for as much as 60 bucks, craziness. The best installment in the Gamera series for a great price....cant go wrong with this one ;)",1314144000,3,265,4.428571428571429
4666945,5,B005ENCIZI,The final film in the impressive 90s Gamera trilogy. Showcases great storytelling and creature special effects. Also included on this disc is an almost unheard of special feature running nearly 3 hours. It has everything about the story genesis and special effects how-to you could ever want concerning the entire trilogy. A truly eye-opening and sometimes odd behind-the-scenes treat. Can't beat the price on this either. Great bargain!!!,1360886400,,439,5.470588235294118

4666947,4,B005ENCIZI,"Surprisingly well done for a kaiju, the plot actually has meat on its bones. Special effects in the last 30 years has come a long way from the early Godzilla movies.",1339459200,,165,4.354838709677419
4666948,3,B005ENCIZI,"Bought this for my husband as a christmas gift, he seems to be happy with it even though i never watched it so i cant give a movie review",1326758400,,137,3.7586206896551726
4666949,5,B005ENCIZI,"This was the third movie in the latest Gamera Trilogy.  What an incredible purchase this was.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and all aspects of this new Blu-ray transfer.  The story weaved in elements from the past two movies and was action packed.  On top of that is nearly two hours of fascinating extras.  More than you'll find on any standard movie purchase.  This included a behind-the-scenes making of the entire Gamera trilogy documentary.  From the actors in the monster suits to the skilled craftsmen that did all the miniature work.  Interviews with cast and crew as they worked.  This documentary alone was nearly two hours, and rivoting to watch.  If you are a fan of 'big monster' movies from Japanese filmmakers, you should love this blu-ray purchase.  Well worth it.",1324944000,,782,4.893129770992366
4666950,3,B005ENCIZI,"Do not know why the R rating, the effects where not that good, story could have been better the older gameras had a better story line this was not bad but if this is a reboot please try again",1322179200,,191,3.923076923076923
4666951,1,B005ENCIZI,"I love this movie but i cannot recommend the bluray as it's subtitles are incomplete, it completely skips lines of dialogue many many times throughout the whole film... disappointing to say the least.",1321747200,7,200,5.090909090909091
4666952,5,B005ENCIZI,"Sure there are too much mystical mumbo-jumbo and the main character is just plain boring and there are too many too long stretches where nothing really happens, but once the monsters show up, this film sports probably one of the best Japanese Monster movie effects. What else could you ask for?",1320624000,,294,4.784313725490196
4666953,3,B005ENCIZI,First of all I love Gamera.  I even have a pet tortoise named Gamera but we tried to watch the Blu ray tonight and can't get the english soundtrack to work.  We tried a few different ways and it always went back to Japanese.  I hope that they will fix this!!,1318809600,2,258,4.019607843137255
4666954,5,B005ENCIZI,"When I first watched ADV's dvd release of the Gamera trilogy, I was a little disappointed in ""Awakening Of Iris"" aka ""Revenge Of Iris"". My favorite has always been ""Advent Of Legion"" aka ""Attack Of Legion"" because of the long epic final fight at the end of the film; until now. I am a huge fan of Shusuke Kaneko's work in the film industry. Being a film student myself, I am always impressed with his film making (""Death Note"" 1 and 2, ""GMK-Giant Monsters All Out Attack"", etc.). He did wonders for the Gamera franchise and brought Godzilla back from mediocrity. With a recent viewing of Gamera 3 on blu-ray, it has now become one of my favorite kaiju films of all-time. I threw myself into the story and was completely sucked in. The blu-ray looks incredible. Many of the close ups of Gamera have that HD pop to them which make them look three dimensional. But be warned, the flashbacks the girl has of Gamera are very creepy and weird showcasing him in black 'n white and with all-white eyes; you might even say it is a little disturbing to the point of possible scaring young children. But other than that, Gamera 3 is an incredible film on many fronts. Epic fights, nice CGI for Gyaos, nice story and a creative new monster (Iris). My favorite modern kaiju films are ""GMK-Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"", ""Gamera: Awakening Of Iris"", ""Long And Dark-Haired Monster Geharha"", ""Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: The Movie"", ""Negadon Monster From Mars"", ""Gamera The Brave"", ""Gamera: Advent Of Legion"", ""Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S."", ""Big Man Japan"" and I like ""Godzilla Final Wars"" but that film had a little too much cheese and over-the-top stuff in it; though I am a fan of Ryuhei Kitamura as well. ""Death Kappa"" and ""Demeking"" are just aweful. I haven't seen ""Deep Sea Monster Reigo"" yet. Monster mayhem films like ""The Host"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Super 8"", ""Monsters"", ""Troll Hunter"", ""The Mist"", ""Chaw"", ""Sector 7"" are always a blast too.",1317686400,,1931,4.767164179104477
8468779,5,B005ENCIZI,This finale to the Gamera Trilogy and hot damn it hold nothing back! Its m got some of the best giant monster fights Ive ever seen and the story itself completes the trilogy! Gamera has never looked better than he does in this film! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great Kaiju film! Gamera rules!!!,1523577600,,310,4.456140350877193

8468782,1,B005ENCIZI,"English language option does not work.
When I watch a movie, I want to relax and enjoy, not strain my eyes and brain trying to read every word on the screen.",1410307200,,157,4.096774193548387
8468783,4,B005ENCIZI,"The first time that I saw this movie was at its North American premiere as part of a G-Fest event.  My nephew and his parents (who are not big monster enthusiasts) attended the showing and despite it being a Japanese language movie with subtitles my brother and his wife were both quite impressed and came away from the movie surprised that it wasn't a throwaway man-in-suit big battle explosion movie without any story or narrative.  As for me, I love me some Gamera and the film didn't disappoint though I do tire of the magical fantasy aspects where the protagonist can overcome anything with the screenplay simply invoking some element of ""magic"" or ""mana"" to cover the gap.  But I digress.

Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris is the third and final movie in Shusuke Kaneko 1990's Gamera movies.  Gamera is again humanities savior, fighting off a growing flock of Hyper Gyaos which are slightly modified/ evolved Gyaos that were introduced in the first film of this trilogy.  This fight that he's involved in causes Gamera to fight without regard to humanity's safety as he usually does and so he ends up reigning down as much terror and destruction as do the Gyaos.  In an opening and quite honestly thrilling sequence Gamera shoots some Gyaos out of the sky, with large flaming chunks of Gyaos flesh crashing into city buildings below and scattering the nighttime revelries of the Japanese inhabitants, and then Gamera lands in a blasting, earth pounding crash that shatters windows and sets off alarms for several city blocks around.  This is some thrilling stuff, with Kaneko and SPFX director Shinji Higuchi continuing to devote time and attention to drafting new angles and ways to see these titanic beings from different vantage points, including ant's eye (humans) perspectives and they do a great job.  The visual effects are a strong point in this feature's favor; Gamera himself has been given another makeover and he looks meaner and fiercer, more streamlined than ever before.  The storyline actually bookends the Gamera versus Gyaos contest and inserts another story, another monster, into the mix: the oddly beautiful, ethereal Iris.  Iris is another mystical monster of the earth, a demon of death of some ancient clan, and is awakened by a young lass who is at odds with the world due to early childhood trauma (she lost her parents in a fight he had with Gyaos, and she blames Gamera).  Just as Gamera had been anchored to humanity by a mystical/ emotional connection with a young girl so too Iris is anchored through this troubled young child and Iris draws on her hate for Gamera as it grows by consuming people and animal's life essences into a creature who threatens to take down the titanic tusked terrapin.  The connection that Iris has with its host human is like that of a succubus; it is seductive, strange, and deadly and is sure to generate some strong reactions from viewers.  The acting overall is decent for a movie like this though there may not be a whole lot for a western audience to attach to.  Director Kaneko gives nods to his former films that only fans are going to pick up on or care about but that shouldn't distract from a casual moviegoer's experience.

Also, a lot has been made of the poor sub-title job that was done.  For non-Japanese speakers who won't know any better I don't think that the sub par subtitle translations will make a difference.  I also believe that the company that released this has rectified this particular issue, but I can't say for certain.  It may be that there is now an English audio track available on some alternate release given that this movie has been re-released as part of a larger Gamera package.",1410048000,,3675,4.76813880126183
8468784,5,B005ENCIZI,"I LOVE this movie!!! I bought the subtitied import VHS version when it came out in 1999, and purchased the movie again when it came out in a Gamera 5-Disc region 2 DVD Box Set a year later ( for $277.00 ).  When I learned that this and the other 2 movies in the Gamera Trilogy were coming out on Blu-Ray, I couldn't wait to pick them up again.  When this film came out, a magazine reviewer called it ""The Finest Giant Monster Film Ever Made"".  That was quite a distinction back in 1999.  Is it still worthy of that title?  Well..let's just say that the movie is SUPERB, and displays a quality of film making FAR beyond it's budget.  If you haven't seen the other 2 films in the Gamera Trilogy ( ""Guardian of the Universe"" and ""Attack of the Legion"" ), then this film won't make any sense to you.  The Trilogy needs to be watched in it's entirety to appreciate this film.  I love Japanese Sci-Fi and am a Godzilla fan of the highest order.  This film blows the Godzilla films away in terms of effects and quality of film making.  There are better looking and sounding Blu-rays out there, to be sure.  After all, this film is nearly 15 years old and the blu-ray was remastered in hi-def.  Nevertheless, if you're a fan of the genre, this film stands VERY tall in the pack and is definitely worth your attention.",1391904000,3,1309,4.319672131147541
8468785,5,B005ENCIZI,"I think you have to love the godzilla genre to enjoy this movie. We certainly did. We hadn't seen it before, so it was a good view and we enjoyed a movie night at home with some popcorn.",1383004800,,186,3.9210526315789473
8468786,1,B005ENCIZI,Total waste of money. Japanese with hit or miss sub titles. This was for a kid's Godzilla collection so not a hit for a kid.,1378252800,,124,4.0
8468787,4,B005ENCIZI,"A massive engaging conclusion to the trilogy.

The Gamera trilogy really surprised me and made me a fan. A fitting conclusion and has extras for all three films included (extras were not included on the original double feature release).",1367625600,,236,5.051282051282051
8468788,2,B005ENCIZI,"Look, I loved the first two Gamera movies (I'm talking about the reboots, mind you, not the 60's ones), but much like the recent Chris Nolan Batman movies, the whole appeal of the first two seems to have been completely forgotten by the filmmakers by the time number three rolled around.

I can get behind the attempt at serious storytelling, but Revenge of Iris is too long, needlessly complex, thematically overblown and way WAY short on satisfying monster action.  The Gaos coming back was cool, but we mostly got to see a city burn, not a big monster fight.  The idea behind Iris was cool but the design was horrible.  Imagine Elton John designing his own Gundam Wing and you have the fullgrown Iris, who, btw, looks terrible in CGI.

Oh, did I mention the CGI arial battle?  So happy that's there.  If the Godzilla movie with Matthew Broderick taught filmmakers anything its that Kaiju fans LOVE it when their monsters are made by computers.  When Gamera and Iris aren't spinning blobs of CGI, they do NOTHING.  They literally just stand there resisting each other, looking all the world like one of those ""Neither of them are moving at all but, boy, something significant sure is taking place"" fights that they'd run on Dragonball Z for episodes at a time.

And don't get me started on that chick and her annoying, smug Andy Warhol-esque friend who show up just long enough to spout some nonsense and get killed.

I loved the first two.  LOVED THEM.  This one is just a bunch of bad anime cliches and two disappointing non-fights.  Avoid.

And before all you Kaiju nuts vote me down, leave a comment explaining WHY this movie is good.  Don't just tell me I ""don't get it.""  Tell me WHY I don't get it.

As far as the BluRay release goes, the picture looks great, the sound and dubbing is good, and as others have stated, the languages are difficult to change and the subtitling is hilariously incomplete (turn it on and have the English dub playing to see just how incomplete) but for what you pay for, there's not much to complain about.  Other than the movie sucking, that is, but I already did that...",1363392000,2,2110,4.578666666666667
