I was bored with my life already moving around so much but i got a sense of adventure while interested in this story of a boy discovering a junkyard area built into metal towers by an old man. The boy does his best to clean up the area and claim it his own until the city officials take notice and threaten to tear it down. When i first found out about the theivery of property taxes i knew i would never own a home traditionally the city is not my friend. The struggle you deal with in childhood follows you into adulthood you're just constantly paying ""THE MAN"" unless you find a way to live off the grid. The world is a trap if you're not good at playing the game and conforming. Its a plastic lifestyle. If i won the lottery i would re design my lifestyle more simple off the grid independent as possible in the country. Life is about where you can place yourself before it places you in the inevitable.",1386633600,,959,4.217391304347826
