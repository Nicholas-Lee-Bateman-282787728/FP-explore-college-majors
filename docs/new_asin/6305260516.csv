8371154,1,6305260516,This movie was tripe! It is worse than SYFY originals and they bite! If you have a 4 year old his might entertain him/her long enough for you to blow your nose.lol,1393372800,,163,4.125
8371155,1,6305260516,"Well, if you are looking for a good movie to make fun of, this is certainly it.  The plot is rather ridiculous, and lacks realism to the max.  Somehow a plane is struck by lighting, and this destroys several control components, and injurs the pilots.  Somehow, the lights and radio are still functional, but a hole has been ripped in the side of the plane.  But it's a good thing that the hole only sucks things out at oppoutune moments, but allows the girl to walk by without flying out of the plane on several occasions.  And it's a good thing she has a cell-phone on board, for when the radio mysteriously explodes.  And since there was no ""do not attempt these stunts at home"" disclaimer, I think I'll try jumping off the back of a refueling plane onto the landing gear of a nearby plane, hopefully suffering no personal injury, despite the high velocity at which I would be traveling.
Yes, a bad movie, but definitely worth seeing, it's a good laugh.
Oh yeah, and the box looks a whole lot like the box for Turbulence, another awesomely bad movie.",1078012800,4,1052,4.481675392670157
8371156,1,6305260516,"they should put this movie on mystery science theatre.  must have been the funniest movie to make comment at i've ever seen.  it had the most ridiculous plot.  how come they didn't bring any profesionals in to help out.  instead the air traffic controler guides her in.  yeah, this is a keeper.  be lookin for it on next year's oscars.",988502400,3,335,4.5
