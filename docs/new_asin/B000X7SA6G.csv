I loved the movie. It was about a famous bullfighter who expected his son, (Ricardo Montalban) to follow in his footsteps. But his son wanted to be a composer and a musician. His daughter wanted to be a bullfighter! The son disappears, and his twin sister decides to fulfill his obligations in the bull ring keeping her identity a secret and posing s her brother. She does this to conceal from their father that the son has run away, but she also hopes to lure her brother back by impersonating him.  It was a wonderful, fun movie and I always hoped to see it again. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that this ""Fiesta"" was not the one I was expecting.",1401926400,,826,4.619047619047619
8227075,5,B000X7SA6G,"I don't agree with other reviewer's opinion saying this is a spoof. It is a comedy, indeed, and I agree this doesn't look like a Mexican movie made by Mexicans, but rather a Hollywood-made Mexican movie; however, one can see they made the effort to keep it as authentic as possible - even with the heavy Hollywood references of the epoch. I love the movie: it is fun, colorful, short, full of music and beautiful voices. And one gets the rare chance to see Jorge Negrete speaking in a very fluent English, throughout an entire movie. A unique treat for the true Mexican cinema fan.",1395705600,,581,4.542857142857143

8227077,1,B000X7SA6G,"I am a fan of Jorge Negrete - one of the great Chart is of the Golden Era of Mexican Movies. When I discovered this movie (which I never heard of in my life), I thought I discovered a treasure. Imagine to hear Negrete sing in an American film, no less, in Technicolor! What I found was a spoof of Mexican culture acted out by a bunch of clowns. The dancing grotesque and the fluidity of a bad pot of ""Chili"" SIN CARNE - like the old lady in the Wendy's commercial would say: WHERE IS THE BEEF! By the way, the actors pronounced the leading actress name so poorly (Cholita), that it s founded like CHORIZA - A FEMALE SAUSAGE!

It is no wonder this film never was shown in theatres.... I give it not a star but a BLACK HOLE!",1378080000,,722,4.084507042253521
