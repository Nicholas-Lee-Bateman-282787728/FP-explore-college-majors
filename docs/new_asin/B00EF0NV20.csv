8604885,5,B00EF0NV20,"This new version of Pound Puppies (from The Hub Network and Hasbro Studios) is a great, extremely underrated show. The series has sharp humor, appealing characters, a terrific voice cast, and sweet, touching story-lines.

The series stars the voices of Eric McCormack, Yvette Nicole Brown, Michael Rapaport, John DiMaggio, Alanna Ubach, Ren Auberjonois, and M. Emmet Walsh.

The episodes on this disc are;

""I Heard the Barks on Christmas Eve""
""I Never Barked for My Father""
""Barlow""
""Good, Dog McLeish!""
""The Prince and the Pupper""

(You will notice that the last episode, ""The Prince and the Pupper"", has very rough, rigid animation compared to the rest of the episodes on the disc. After the airing of it, the animation studio changed, and the series now has clean, fluid animation)

If you are a fan of this show, then you will definitely want to purchase this DVD.",1376179200,4,869,4.924657534246576
