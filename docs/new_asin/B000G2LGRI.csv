It is about a single, but pivotal, mammoth battle between Roman legions under Varus and and a German army made up of troups from several tribes under Arminius.  Arminius had served previously in a Roman auxiliary, and was acquainted with Varus who considered him to be a friend.  The battle took place in 9 A.D. between the Rhine and Elba rivers in Teutoburg Forrest, and would devestate the Roman army.  It affected the entire Roman empire. Gleaned from internet information: ""Augustus, 72 years old at the time of the Varus disaster lamented the loss of his 3 legions until the time of his death. According to Suetonius, ""He was so greatly affected that for several months in succession he cut neither his beard nor his hair, and sometimes he could dash his head against a door, crying ""Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!"" Though punitive campaigns under Germanicus, later conducted during the reign of Tiberius, would eventually return the lost eagles, the Germanic victory forever signaled the end of Roman expansion into Germania. In fact, the 3 legions lost were never replaced, at least not the legionary numbers XVII, XVIII and XVIIII. For a considerable period of time, the active legionary roster was cut to 25 rather than 28.""
Archaeologists have found many artifacts on and near the site of the battle in Teutoburg Forrest.",1217116800,3,1481,4.931726907630522
