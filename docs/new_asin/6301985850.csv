7819270,1,6301985850,"The police arrest a healthy youngish man (without an arrest warrant) and take him to the police station to try to extort a confession to a crime he says he knows nothing about. Several hours later they deliver his body to his wife. He died in police custody from blows to the head.

The movie is of the most incredibly stupid, manipulated I have seen in decades. The magistrate, though he considers himself brilliant and suspects the policemen (how else could the arrested man die?), does nothing to prevent the police murderers from tampering with the witnesses and evidence. In real life, a post mortem would have settled the issue once and for all.

Don't waste your time on this trash movie.",1293235200,,695,4.688524590163935
