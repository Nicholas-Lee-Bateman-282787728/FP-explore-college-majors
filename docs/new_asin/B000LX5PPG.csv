Great gift Idea for RVB fans",1418601600,,162,4.225806451612903
8164760,4,B000LX5PPG,"Have you ever wanted to see a wacky sitcom based on ""Halo""?

I haven't. You probably haven't either.

But we got one anyway. And in the machinima webseries ""Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles,"" we're introduced to the bumbling space marines who fight for domination of a barren canyon that nobody really cares about, on an otherwise deserted planet. Pretty much nothing actually gets accomplished (except a few accidental deaths), but it's pretty hilarious nothingness -- and it lays the groundwork for the story arcs of seasons to come.

In the future, there is some kind of vague civil war going on, and so the two sides have stationed troops at Blood Gulch Canyon -- one Blue station, and one Red station. Most of the time, the troops just hang around annoying each other. But in this case, the Red Team has just gotten a new jeep that Sarge (Matt Hullum) christens the ""Warthog,"" as well as a new rookie called Donut. The Blues are getting a tank.

Then Donut gets confused, wanders into the Blue base and is accidentally given the flag -- which sparks off a bizarre battle between the two sides that ends up killing the de facto Blue leader Church. It's not a huge spoiler; he dies pretty early.

Blue soldier Tucker calls for reinforcements, and they get the black-armored, foul-mouthed death machine Tex... who has an odd connection to the now-ghostly Church. The on-and-off conflict between them is further complicated by the discovery of a lifelike robot, a near-death experience (""... you'd rub my neck with aloe vera?!""), lightish red armor, a teleporter, and an AI that is influencing Tex from inside her armor.

While later seasons became more plot-based, ""Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles"" is gloriously plotless mayhem, with the occasional battle scene or wacky conflict. Most of the season falls under two basic categories:
1. Characters running around causing massive damage to themselves and others.
2. Characters hanging around having conversations completely unrelated to the war they're supposed to be fighting (""Did the fact he never talks get to you?"" ""I just thought he was a silent guy."" ""Not even that he drinks motor oil and sleeps standing up?"" ""I thought he was just trying to impress me"").

I can only assume that the Red and Blue groups were sent to this planet so that they wouldn't be a handicap to the more competent space marines, because these guys are hilariously awful. Some are idiots (Donut, Caboose), Sarge is somewhat insane (he believes pumas are mythical), Grif is lazy and Simmons has his lips firmly planted on Sarge's behind. The most competent one of the bunch is Church, who always seems to be on the verge of snapping -- even from beyond the grave. Or the not-grave, since his teammates are too dim to bury his body.

But amidst all the chaos and wackiness (""It's not pink! It's LIGHTISH RED!""), there is a little thread of actual plot. Two characters die in remarkably tidy ways... well, three, but one of them is revived from the brink of death. And there is the whole matter of the mysterious AI that is influencing Tex -- it's not a huge part of the story, but it clearly is meant to be the beginning of an arc. And it's more serious than most of the goings-on.

""Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles"" is a fun way to kick off this gloriously wacky little web-series, which proves that awkward CGI animation can't trump good writing. Just remember: You can't pick up chicks in a tank.",1410393600,,3495,4.688417618270799
8164761,4,B000LX5PPG,"Wonderful reminds me off the classic days of watching it online on RvB.com. A wonderful collector's item; Highly recommended, only topped by the Blu-Ray version.",1407283200,,161,5.48
8164762,5,B000LX5PPG,These guys have hit my funny bone time and time again. I will continue to buy this series as long as it goes on.,1382400000,,112,3.7083333333333335
8164763,5,B000LX5PPG,"Not sure if this is actually a Special Edition Season 1 for nine dollars, or just a stock photo. If it is the real deal, these are exceedingly rare. The ""Special Edition"" was a joke we put on the first run of DVDs because we didn't yet know there would be a Season Two. So, calling the DVD Season One didn't make any sense. It was just ""the Red vs Blue DVD"" back then. If you have a Special Edition it means that you have one of the first 10,000 DVDs ever made. It also means that either @gus, @geoff or me personally mailed it to you. In a way, the Special Edition joke actually came to mean something. I don't even own one anymore.

BUT buyer beware. This may not be an actual Special Edition DVD. It may just be a photo they pulled to represent the product, not knowing the distinction.",1365724800,6,789,4.1568627450980395
8164764,5,B000LX5PPG,"So the title of this dvd can be confusing, but it's simply RVB Season 1. It includes some extras like the PSAs and if you love Red VS Blue, then you probably have this DVD already, but if never watched RVB, you can just go on Roosterteeth's website and watch the videos. If you want one for your collection, then I recommend buying the remastered version that came out a while ago.",1314403200,6,381,4.305555555555555
