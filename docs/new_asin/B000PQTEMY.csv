2827495,4,B000PQTEMY,"I originally viewed this film back in 1974, when it was released, and when I was just 13 yrs old.  I wanted to see if it was as terrifying now as it was then.  Although dated and a little cheesy, it was still pretty disturbing.",1410739200,,227,4.022222222222222
2827496,1,B000PQTEMY,"This version is absolutely worthless. Maybe one day some company will re release it on blu ray or even a good DVD, but don't buy this. The audio doesn't sync up with the picture, and the picture quality looks like a VHS from the 80's, it's very dark, quiet and muddy looking, there is also no menu or any other features. If you can get the split DVD with Motel Hell, go for that or wait for a re release, as my favourite B movie, it deserves much better than this. Don't waste your money here.",1409097600,7,493,4.145833333333333
2827497,4,B000PQTEMY,"I have Deranged solo, without Motel Hell, and I must say, I enjoyed it (more than Motel Hell, which I've also seen). Roberts Blossom's performance is worth the price of admission to this little necrophelia-fest. Really, the whole show is Roberts Blossom, who's even creepier than Leatherface. Two production issues detract: some scenes are too dark and murky, and the sound sync isn't good, sometimes off by as much as a second. Best line of the movie? Ol' Ezra displays his finely tuned sense of humour when he plucks on a violin and says, ""That isn't cat gut."" The whole family will chuckle. P.S. Fans of this flik might also like Skinned Alive, with the delightful Mary Jackson.",1408579200,,681,4.779661016949152

But...another day! I was ill and stuck inside it popped up again so I let go! This time and not take it so seriously and be entertained!!!! It is hilarious! I haven't laughed or responded back to a movie like this in years! I'm sure my neighbors think something isn't quite right with me as I watched it! Ezra made the movie! His performance was A1! The ""journalist"" that keeps popping up makes me crack up! It makes the story pretend .true or not true its annoying and messes with the flow! ""Ezra"" brings us back to his messed up reality and is creepy! Very bloody also funny at times especially as he tries to ""feed mother"" Linda Blair's left overs! the bright orange blood spewing from her mouth was gross and a bit funny! You have to give this movie a chance! Some of the quotes he says I am still cleaning up my tears from laughing! He should be right up there with Freddie or Michael Meyers! I am going to watch this movie again after I send in this review! So to wrap it up! Don't take it too seriously in the beginning they are helping us to get into his demented brain! It works! Then if you love being creeped out and scared its a coming"" sir or ma'am!"" Ezra is a good son! Even better than Mr. Bates in psycho!

2827501,3,B000PQTEMY,"I'm seeing that most of the reviews are for the double feature of Deranged/Motel Hell, however, I'm only reviewing the Deranged film, since I've not seen Motel Hell nor do I own that double feature DVD. Deranged is one of the better, if not one of the best film adaptations of a real life serial killer. Made in 1974, this movie is basically the story of Ed Gein, with only the names and locations changed. What makes this film better than a lot of others is the accuracy of the real events and crimes of Ed Gein himself. Not saying its 100% accurate, but it comes a lot closer than any of the other Ed Gein based films that I've seen. And just as a standalone film, even if you don't have any knowledge of the crimes its based upon, it's still a solid film. Roberts Blossom does a really good performance as the Ezra (Ed). Its a fairly short film, and a narrator begins the film explaining the back story of Ezra, and periodically comes in and gives the audience more information regarding the events and crimes of the main protagonist. Though warned at the beginning of the film by the narrator that this film may not be for the ""squeamish"", its really not much of a gorefest at all. Actually it could have, and should have been much more graphic,considering the actual crimes the movie is based upon. Perhaps the director wasn't going for that shock value, or maybe it was for budgetary reasons, nonetheless, what effects are in the film aren't bad for it's time. Though when compared to something like legendary The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (loosely based on Ed Gein), which came out that same year and was done on a low budget, this film's effects don't reach that level of creepiness and authenticity. Though few films do. Like I've said, if you're looking for a fairly accurate account of the crimes of Ed Gein, or if you just simply want to watch a solid horror/thriller flick, then I suggest you check this one out. Again, to me, its much better than a lot of these B-movies being made about Gein and a lot of other real-life serial killers.",1310774400,,2049,4.49597855227882
2827502,5,B000PQTEMY,"Since I've lived fairly close to Plainfield almost my entire life, and knew several people who knew Ed Gein in life, I always had an interest in Ed Gein.  However, there are very few films that depict his life with any degree of accuracy.  This is one of them, despite the fact that they changed his name to Ezra Cobb.  And for an 80's B movie, this is really well done.  The filmmakers took some liberties, of course, but still pulled off a very accurate portrayal.

The actor they got to play Gein/Cobb was perfect for the role.",1186185600,3,530,4.36734693877551

2827504,5,B000PQTEMY,"DERANGED is one of the better films based on the exploits of Ed Gein. Roberts Blossom plays Ezra Cobb, an unbalanced man in a small rural town. When his hyper-religious mother dies, Ezra has a difficult time adjusting to her absence. So much so, that he digs up her corpse, returns it to her old room, and carries on as though she never left! Now, If Cobb had merely done this, as bizarre as it is, he would at least have remained harmless. Alas, things just aren't right in old Ezra's brain-basket, and he begins murdering women in heinous ways. DERANGED is an odd film from 1974, made in a semi-documentary style, complete w/ intermittent intrusions by a bespectacled narrator. Surprisingly grim and ultimately ghoulish, DERANGED delivers its shivers honestly. Blossom's portrayal is quite realistic, as he never strays too far from his backward, seemingly non-threatening persona. Rather than taking the ""wild-eyed maniac"" approach, Cobb comes across more as a pitiful creature who just may kill you if you're not careful. Funny in spots, the humor comes mostly from the obliviousness of most of Ezra's friends and relatives, who write off his obvious insanity as mere eccentricity. Recommended for horror fans, especially those enamored w/ Gein lore / films. DERANGED belongs right along side PSYCHO, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, etc. ...",1442880000,2,1338,5.086363636363636

Movie Review: I TRIED AND TRIED to like this movie but I couldn't get into it. It was paced extremely slow, the nerdy f****r narrating was annoying as hell, the characters suck and so forth. The lead actor was not convincing as a killer.......... UH! This movie bored me to s#!+! I HATE IT SO KISS MY FAT BLUBBERY WALRUS A$$!!

2827508,5,B000PQTEMY,"Deranged is one of those films over the course of 20 years (Between Tape Traders, & Horror Message Boards) It has gained much more attention and it should, it's very much under-rated!
Deranged is a 1974 oddity of a Film
It Pre-Dates the Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre by only a year!
It's also the first real Biography about a real life Boogie Man  (Ed Gein who you can't call a serial killer due to the fact I'm pretty sure he only killed two woman. But, what the local police found at Ed Farmhouse changed the ""wholesome"" Clean ""Leave It to Beaver"" type Americana forever
Ed Gein was proof real monster's were your next door neighbors!
This films tries to paint a picture of the lead up to his Infamous arrest... IMO it does it pretty good
Somethings about this film are very strange and disjointing (The man in the trench coat who walks into frame who is Narrating the film, the score is flat out creepy loops of a  pipe organ-based hymn play throughout) Sounds like funeral music
This film was very much a Indie Film (when there really was no such thing as Indies)
The F/X and Gore are strong.....Tom Savini created the  make-up effects I'm pretty sure this is his first real jobs in the film industry
If your a Old school Horror Fan (1970's to late 90's your enjoy this film for what it is)

Roberts Blossom  (Escape from Alcatraz,  Close Encounters of the Third Kind,  Home Alone,  The Quick and the Dead) Plays  Ezra Cobb
aka Ed Gein
His performance is really good it's very Organic and a bit creepy  this is 1974 there's been very few Modern Horror Films/Slashers besides Psycho!
(There's a story about Deranged being brought up to Mr. Blossom  during the filming of the Quick and the Dead on the Arrow Video BR Needless to say he wasn't proud of this film) which is kind of sad cause he was one of the first 3 dimensional character during the modern Horror Age!

What fan's might not know about this Flick there are two Official Home Video Blu Ray's of this film
Originally it was Distributed by Arrow Home Video out of the UK  2 years ago (2013)  it's Region (B) But, if you have a region free player (you're gold)
then  Kino Lorber got the license to release it in North America (Region A)
Never bought anything from Kino Lorber I never heard of them But, the US Blu Ray is actually very strong
It has some Great Exclusives that the previous Arrow Video Version doesn't
The BR actually arrived yesterday (Not wet or Damaged) Thank God
I had a few min and pop it into the Player the reviews saying it look bad are  either Trolling or they might wanna run a BR Disc Cleaner through there system
The Kino BR looks very good I only scanned through a few scenes (It might be in fact the same HD Transfer Arrow Video put out
Arrow has in the past done HQ HD Transfers then give the film to US Distributors at a cost I'd think (This happened with Demons & Demons II)
No matter what BR you pick they BOTH look awesome (Compared to the Horrid DVD put out by MGM on a double feature build) and the dvd looked amazing Compared to the Old Uncut  VHS Bootleg I had before the dvd

Now I'm gonna give a quick run down on both BR and what each version offers the consumer/fans

Kino Lorber Blu Ray Version:
the Uncut version  (1.85:1)  -1920x1080p
**Audio Commentary by writer and co-director Alan Ormsby
**Audio Commentary by Film Historian Richard Harland Smith,
**Interview with Producer Tom Karr,
*Original Theatrical Trailer
All these extras minus the Trailer are Exclusives to this Disc! Lots of very cool stuff (MGM would've never done this)

The Arrow Video Blu Ray:  (Has alt. cover art you can flip the cover much like Scream Factory has been doing with there BR's Arrow has been doing it much longer Trust me!)
HD Blu Ray (1080p) & Standard definition dvd
Unrated/Uncut version featuring the infamous 'brain-scooping scene"" available uncut in the UK for the first time!
*Optional English SDH subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing
**Audio Commentary w/ Special effects artist Tom Savini
*Introduction to the film by Savini
**A Blossoming Brilliance: Scott Spiegel (Intruder, Evil Dead II) speaks about Deranged
star Roberts Blossom and the lasting legacy of this gore-soaked gem
**Ed Gein: From Murderer to Movies-
**Laurence R. Harvey (The Human Centipede II) discuss the lurid legacy of the Wisconsin serial killer and the secrets of portraying a cinematic psychopath....
**The Wages of Sin-- Making of featurette comprising newly transferred 16mm production footage and a archive interview with director Jeff Gillen
**Original Trailer,
*Still gallery,

Over all in my honest opinion both BR are  real must owns! Do to the fact you get a lot of exclusive extras for both versions
If you're not sure snag the US Version ASAP while the price is super low it's without a doubt worth it just for the extras alone
Then go from there either you will  love it or hate it  (A Film like this has no common ground)

The $11.99 price drop makes this  a must have for all Horror Fans  9/10
In 2000 a small indie film company put out Ed Gein it's no where near as good as Deranged",1438905600,11,5082,4.552747252747253

8192904,3,B000PQTEMY,"Having seen Ed Gein (2000) not that long ago I was pointed towards Deranged so ordered the Arrow Video Blu-ray version from the UK. I got around to watching it last night and I'm still not sure what to make of it.

 Yes it's probably the truest representation of the Ed Gein story although I couldn't get past the digging up his mother aspect which is central to the movie but something Gein never did. With the interjections of the reporter addressing the audience whilst the actors are still sitting there in shot it gave the movie a very amateurish theatre play aspect to it I couldn't also shake. Like an old-time cheesy midday movie but about Ed Gein.

 I thought Roberts Blossom was very good as Ed Gein from what I understand of Gein he was true to him being a meek, simple almost sickly type middle-aged man who you also felt some compassion for. Once his domineering mother died he was like a sick little boy left to fend for himself in a world he didn't really understand where with no guiding hand his mental illnesses consumed him. I noticed the death of Ed's brother wasn't touched on in Deranged and Ed himself was always suspected of being his killer.

 The Arrow Video BR package really is sublime the movie looks really good despite being more than 40 years old now, it's the unrated version with the pretty gnarly 'brain-scooping scene' and has special features like an audio commentary with Tom Savini, 'A Blossoming Brilliance' about a ten minute interview with Scott Spiegel talking a bit too excitedly about Deranged's legacy, 'Ed Gein: From Murderer to Movies' which features Laurence R. Harvey (The Human Centipede II & III) talking about Ed Gein's legacy and how some horror fans unfortunately end up celebrating real-life serial killers which I agree with him entirely.

 The package also features 'The Wages of Sin' a making of segment with an old interview with director Jeff Gillen and trailer and stills gallery. The booklet that comes with it is excellent I found Stephen Thrower's detailed piece on Deranged fascinating along with Calum Waddell's archived interview with producer Bob Clark who at the time disowned the movie having his name removed from it but before his untimely death had started to see the movie in a better light and of course The Gore-met's article on the history of Ed Gein in cinema re-printed from an issue of Rue Morgue (I need to see that recent Ed Gein musical now!).

 The package of this release from the transfer, special features and booklet is fantastic but my only gripe is the movie itself. I can see how for it it's time it would've been something else but looks like a family picnic (almost literally) compared to most modern day horror movies.

 On the whole a large amount of creative licence was taken with Deranged with Ed exhuming the corpse of his mother. However I'm glad I've seen it especially in such an elaborate package but feel a truly representative Ed Gein movie has yet to be made.",1463702400,,2966,4.6826923076923075

8192906,4,B000PQTEMY,"BOTTOM LINE: The gruesome events depicted in DERANGED are based on true events, which makes the film even more disturbing than it otherwise normally would be. Still, it's an interesting slice-of-life from the unbalanced side of the tracks. It certainly isn't for everyone. Slasher fans might be disappointed in the fake, old school gore and the lack of nudity or action. Truth is stranger than fiction though, so if this sort of thing floats your boat then it's well worth a look. Ed Gein's exploits inspired this film, plus the classic Psycho (the book & movie), Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the ""Buffalo Bill"" character from Silence of The Lambs, all of their countless sequels & prequels and the endless blood-red ocean of knock-offs & imitators that continue to flood theaters and home video shelves to this day, some 60+ years later. Of those films, DERANGED is among the first & most truthful ...for whatever that's worth. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Ezra Cobb is an unassuming middle-aged man who by all outward appearances is a devoted son to his ailing, Bible-thumping mother; living a quiet life as a farmer and occasional handyman in a tiny rural midwest community. He doesn't seem to be the brightest crayon in the box, has few friends and no apparent interest in women; says they're all evil and so forth. But hey, that's just old Ez for ya, right? In truth Cobb is a unhinged individual with a very fragile hold on his sanity. After his beloved mother's death he eventually topples over the edge, plunging headfirst into the most depraved depths; committing acts of inhuman torture and sadism that were - and still are - almost unimaginable.

THOUGHTS: This amateurish, utterly disturbing motion picture is likely the closest portrayal of the true account of infamous Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein put on film, at least until the Steve Railsback-starring movie made in 2000. No one could ever suspect or believe, in even their most horrific nightmares, what ghastly acts and atrocities the plain-looking Gein had perpetrated. The events and ramifications of his ghoulish activities continue to shock & sicken American more than 60 years later. The film is interesting and quite unsensational in many ways, but typical explicit shock & exploitation fare in so many others. Roberts Blossom is amazing in the lead role as Cobb. He is the kind of guy you see around town and probably know one or two fellas like him. You could never think such a shy, simple man could ever be capable of anything untoward, could you? That was the key to his ""success"" as a killer. Who'da thunk it of a fellow like Gein/Cobb. Blossom is an interesting-looking actor with a memorable face. Whether his mannerisms were specifically created for the role of Cobb or if they're simply a part of who Blossoms is, we may never know. Either way they add layers to what could otherwise be a one-note performance in the vein of ""Leatherface"" from Texas Chainsaw Massacre: memorable only for what he does. Cobb on the other hand was a character well before he went south. One you might actually find yourself liking! The rest of the film is ups & downs. The other actors, especially the woman, are amateurish and it hurts the film overall, particularly the over-the-top fat chick who foolishly tries to get into Cobb's pants. The neighbors who take pity on Ezra and are the closest things he has to friends are both pretty good. The production design is admirable. The dilapidated house Cobb and his mother occupy feels very earthy and real, not like a set. The gore effects are minimal but stomach-churning in their effectiveness. A young Tom Savini is credited with them, so that makes sense. For me the real misfire of the film is the annoying inclusion of a ""news reporter"" / narrator character. He's on-screen a few times and a voice-over in others. It would have been better to just tell the story straightforward without this guy, or else go the full documentary style approach but DERANGED tries to straddle both sides of the fence and it doesn't work particularly well.

THE BLU-RAY: As these things go the Kino Lorber hi-def release for DERANGED is a pretty good one. The picture is strong and in sharp focus most of the time. Blacks are solid & inky, mid-tones are level and the artifacting & pixelation are kept to a minimum. Some video noise is seen from time to time but not to the detriment of the overall viewing experience. Sound is even but on the soft side. Bonus feature include 2 audio commentaries: one by writer/co-director Alan Ormsby, the other by film historian Richard H. Smith. An interview with the film's producer is also on tap, along with the original theatrical trailer. Sadly, the excellent documentary that was included with the old VHS release of DERANGED has not been made available here. It was a strictly amateur affair featuring home movie footage of the town of Plainfield, WI and surrounding areas tied to the Gein case, with voiceover narration detailing the accounts of the crimes and what became of Gein afterwards. Fascinating stuff. Too bad it didn't get included but given it's crude nature I can understand why the crew at Kino Lorber chose not to bother.",1451520000,2,5175,4.818897637795276
