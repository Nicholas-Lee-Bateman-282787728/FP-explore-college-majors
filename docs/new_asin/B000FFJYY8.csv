Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of source material (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

Based on Erle Stanley Garner's book and the tribunal he founded in 1948, THE COURT OF LAST RESORT had a 26-episode, one-season run on the NBC NETWORK (1957-58), and was rebroadcast on ABC in 1959-60.

Not every investigation on this drama resulted in reversal of a conviction or a new trial. Some of the accused were proved guilty. That uncertainty in outcomes was the main appeal of  ""Last Resort."" The main character is investigator Sam Larson (Lyle Bettger). Garner and sixother real people on the Court are portrayed by actors.

That it only lasted a single season is unfortunate, for this was a well-made and acted TV program. Highly recommended.
