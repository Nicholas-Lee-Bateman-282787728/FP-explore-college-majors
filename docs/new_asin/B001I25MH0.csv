8310330,5,B001I25MH0,"I'm reviewing the entire series here instead of on all 3 sets that you must purchase to complete the set / collection. All in all it was a solid series. It wasn't AMAZING; it also, was not a waste of my time. GSA is somewhere in the middle, yet able to fully hold my attention through to the end. And in my opinion the artwork is excellent. As are both languages (Japanese track and the English dub - everyone deserves to take a bow as they've done a fantastic job...no phoning it in. Everyone brought their ""A"".

To completely over-simplify my review, basically we have a band of monster hunters (the monsters are called youi (pronounced Yow-ie)) who defeat them as quick as they come, and are rewarded with the youi flesh (literally just falling to the ground in front of them at every kill, heh) to dine on. The reason for this is built in perfectly...because once the youi flesh is tasted, everything else tastes like dirt and they are never satisfied (unless dining on the youi meat). The main character, Ryuudou Yukiatsu is a former samurai turned vagabond, turned whatever gets him through the day...he's just living his life. But he has the power of the Ayashi which can draw out the ""character"" or symbol for the youi and pretty much anything / anyone he puts his hands on. This ""character drawing out technique"" is pretty much where the weapon comes from that is necessary to destroy the youi.

And while relatively incomplete, I'm going to stop there with anything else interior to the series because I simply don't want to give anything away. While I stated (and stand by it) the series is in fact ""somewhere in the middle"" and worth watching, it is NOT complex. As such, too many segues or getting chatty about what happens episode to episode, I feel will dull the edge so to speak.

Fortunately, I went into the series 100% blind - I knew nothing about it, and frankly I liked the box more than anything and just bought it. Just as fortunately, it was a good show! Moving on from the show to the actual discs and the box......I could NOT BE MORE PLEASED!! As a collector, I absolutely love the case for GSA. Mine arrived in perfect shape, it fits very snugly but not so much any of the pseudo-cardboard has to be bent to open or close it as some have mentioned. It's plenty easy to pull the top up and reseal the discs and cases. (There is also a manga volume in the box which you have to remove to fit all the disc cases.) As a shelf item, it's one of my favorites on display just by the sheer aesthetics of it!)

If you are a collector as well, you cannot beat the price for both a good series to watch as well as adding a truly nifty ""boxset"" item to your shelves!!",1424995200,,2682,4.390342052313883
8310331,5,B001I25MH0,Lots of bonus materials in this boxed set.,1420329600,,42,4.375
8310332,5,B001I25MH0,"I was surprise how big the box was for the limited edition set. I wasn't expecting the manga to come with it to.
One of my favorite animes because of the great voice casting in the series. It came on time and it was in great condition.",1395100800,,235,4.0212765957446805
8310333,4,B001I25MH0,"I took a chance on this anime due to my lack of knowledge on this series and small amount of reviews.  I bought this box set, which I believe will house parts 2 and 3 (then they arrive...already ordered them!)  I wasn't sure what to expect but this anime is good so far.  I'm on episode 5 but already enjoying it.  In my opinion, I didn't quite get the description until I started watching it and looking forward to watching the rest.  Interesting concept of using the power behind a word.  Ayashi has the ability to bring the word to life, so to speak, and it become a weapon to defeat the youi.  Not a lot of blood and guts so far but half naked men in the bathhouse of the 1st episode (don't get your hopes up... they were old lazy men).So far I haven't heard bad language.",1367539200,,776,4.167785234899329
8310334,5,B001I25MH0,"Got this for $2.19, using a gift card I earned free here: swagbucks.com/refer/Animallady1234.
This set comes two DVDs, volumes 1 and 2, volume 1 of the manga and a guide book. The anime and manga are a little different, but both are still good. It should come with instructions on how to open it though. Took me a few minutes to figure it out, almost ripping the top off. The easiest way to open it is to hold both the top and base at the same time, sliding them apart. But make sure it's upright when you do, or the DVDs and books will fall out.",1360627200,2,546,4.160377358490566
