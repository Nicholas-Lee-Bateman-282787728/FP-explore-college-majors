The whole series should be on PBS at least once a month and I guarantee you'll raise some serious money with these awesome panoramic video's of Switzerland and the surrouding areas . Unfortunately ""NO ONE"" has made these available on cd and could make a fortune just re-formating these on CD to sell on the PBS stations . Watch just one and you'll know what I mean . IT will take your breath away . The Best travel videos I have ever seen as far as scenic area's go . ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ! Sincerly, Pat Simmons",1221955200,,575,4.383177570093458
7904598,4,B000006PRR,"We're not train buffs, but we are *Alps* buffs, and I did live in Switzerland as a teenager. We *love* these videos and watch them quite often. Many times we'll put them on at bedtime and relax to views of our  favorite alpine locations before dozing off. We also find them to be great  conversation starters. We recently ran them with the sound muted during a  dinner party. Gradually the conversation turned to the Swiss Alps as our  guest got caught up in the obvious beauty. We enjoy reliving our travels  there each time we watch and share our stories with friends. The only flaw  is perhaps an excess of arcane detail about train model numbers and voltage  and kiloherz and the like that suffuses the narrative.",958953600,,717,4.5984251968503935
