1393893,3,B000054P96,Very weird movie and intentionally so I would imagine. I tried twice to watch to through and never made it. Lose interest about 1/3 way in,1402012800,,138,4.346153846153846
1393894,4,B000054P96,It was a crazy kinda sexual dubbed show. Interesting to say the least!! If it was in English might have been even better.,1399248000,,121,4.304347826086956
1393895,5,B000054P96,"It seems to me that many seem to discredit Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday for a number of fairly juvenile reasons. Some are understandable if we look at the pacing, the unrealistic scenario on which it is based, and so forth. Other issues like it's masochistic and depressing nature are not reasons to dislike a film from an objective standpoint. Indeed, I was lured to the film first by it's title (which I find to be thought provoking: why do I not want to die on a Sunday?) and the main actor Jean-Marc Barr who has performed in a number of films I've enjoyed. It is worth mentioning that I come into the film from a relatively bleak worldview and carry a load of depression daily, so I found this exploration of such sensations to be wholly pleasurable given my subjective experience of the world.

With that said, it's not for everyone. At times it is heavy handed. The spiritual property of sex to revitalize the dead is something many will find more comical than serious, but if you are able to empty your mind of the notion that this is just some hammy, French flick look to induce a sense of soft-core porn and depress you for it's own sake, then perhaps you will find something more enjoyable.

Of course, if you're peering into it's lack of a rating and expecting hardcore sex scenes and grotesque violence, you are also in the wrong place. The film is far more psychological, and in this way the film works best. Death in the film is not particularly violent, bloody, gory, etc.; but it's poignant. Sex is brutal, but again, not in a pornographic way; but the film explores the sadomasochistic nature of the relationship that unfolds early on.

Now, don't look at my 5 star rating and think I find the film to be perfect. I do not. But, as a ride that heavy relies on emotions and the subjective experience to coincide with what it is telling us, the film is pleasurable and easily a French language film I can relate to and enjoy.",1395619200,,1941,4.446629213483146
1393896,2,B000054P96,Why do so many French films come across as badly acted soft core porn. I also tend to notice that all French actresses have small breasts,1390089600,2,137,4.3076923076923075
1393897,2,B000054P96,"Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday is a maybe OK idea in search of a proper execution, pun intended. The film cannot find its feet amid the swirling winds of half-baked declarations on the true nature of life and love. The director has placed his words in any available mouth - pun also intended - with no rhyme nor reason undercutting any attempt at finding real characterizations for his actors. Everyone in this is a philosopher regardless of who they actually might be. It's a puppet show, and the strings keep getting tangled up. Why did certain characters suddenly burst out with some idea? Was it part of who they were? And why did they speak so much about sex when so little of it is ever shown? Is this Didier LePecheur being coy? And the friend with AIDS? How very 1992. Seriously, this movie just pissed me off. No, it didn't ""make me think"" because I've thought about all this sophomoric crap more than I ever needed to, and there are certainly no new thoughts presented here nor even old ones presented in a new way. It's a hodge-podge. You can't simply line up ten characters and then give each of them a paragraph of your all-nighter dorm chats to spout. I've given it 2 stars for the idea that started it off.",1328832000,,1219,4.4222222222222225
1393898,2,B000054P96,"It opens in club-land; flashing lights and writhing bodies. The protagonists work in a hospital, in the morgue. An event takes place that sets off a chain of responses; one, stunningly surprising. To mention the event would give the entire plot away. The plot becomes divergent. Weird things start happening. I continued watching, wondering what the point might be. It's certainly complicated. Club-land returns. More unfathomable stuff follows and then... It's a curious film on which the point was certainly missed by me.",1318464000,,523,5.313253012048193
1393899,1,B000054P96,"What can you say about a bunch of people sitting around and watching a friend die from Aids. The story was dismal from start to finish. The characters were unlikeable for the most part. This is one I would file in my BIG MISTAKE folder, as it was a big mistake to have ordered it. Some might call it ""Avant Garde"", but I call it trash and a complte waste of the actor's & director's time to make it.",1233273600,3,399,4.063291139240507

7931090,4,B000054P96,"A really bizarre movie...SM, ennui, necrophilia and wacky french existentialism all wrapped into one as the characters try to answer the question of WTF?",1446508800,,153,5.416666666666667

7931092,3,B000054P96,A fair film.  I have seen better and I have seen worse,1425772800,,54,3.5
7931093,2,B000054P96,Did not like the storyline,1425081600,,26,4.4
7931094,4,B000054P96,"This movie started slow, but that was part of the plot. The main male character seemed to lead you down a path that was truly believable when a man tries to deny the fact that he cannot have sex without some type of emotional feelings, but like in real life, many of us learn this way too late. This is a French film that makes you think about sex, love, life and envy - well made.",1413331200,,381,4.026315789473684

7931096,4,B000054P96,Very strange movie that grabs you and keeps you wondering hat can the main actor possibly do now. Then you end up finding out that he's not a bad guy but broken and does strange things to survive.,1403568000,,196,4.184210526315789
7931097,3,B000054P96,"It was an interesting movie, but I wouldn't watch it again, not that interesting.  Did keep my attention throughout the movie.",1402876800,,126,5.0
