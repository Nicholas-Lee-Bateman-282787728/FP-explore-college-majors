2769972,5,B000NJMJYS,"Nice!  They work great.  I have to add that we purchased from H/D sensors that screw into the socket and they didn't work.  We knew it was because we have a large light pole right above one of our outside lights, but we really wanted sensoref lights on the garage, for obvious reasons.

So... We took a chance & ordered these bulbs.  SO pleasantly surprised they work.

2770014,5,B000NJMJYS,This is a great DVD for my 3 1/2 year old son. He especially loves the section on street sweepers and garbage trucks. And it is very educational to teach kids and adults watching with them about how things are done through the whole process. The only complaint my son had was that they don't play the MM song on this one as much and he was upset not to be able to sing along. This is not necessarily a bad thing for the parents :-),1402876800,,431,4.023255813953488

2770040,5,B000NJMJYS,My grandson is crazy about firetrucks and big machines. He loves this video. It has the sounds he likes and it is told in a format that he can understand.

It's about 90 minutes of REAL city vehicles doing what they do while given character voices and names. It features 3 segments: Firetrucks, In the City (street sweepers, tree trimmers, etc.) and big tractors. My son has learned so much about what these vehicles do and points them out when we're in town!

This has three different scenes...the Firetruck, Street Sweeper & the Garbage truck. He likes the Garbage one the best and he will watch all three all day. Filmed in Canada in an earlier period but still quite entertaining. Us adults learned quite a bit about the different jobs and what is involved.

2770079,4,B000NJMJYS,"This is a great video.  I highly recommend it for those that like trucks and, well, more trucks.  It opens with the fire trucks, which is a bit of a bore.  Not a lot of action, but informative nonetheless. It does have fire trucks, though.  Always good.  Then there is the city maintenance fleet vehicles.  Pretty cool.  Last but not least there is the garbage dump.  Excellent.  What a finish.
This is well made and entertaining video.  I could watch this all day.  Heck, I have watched it all day.  We got this because we liked the other Mighty Machines video, ""Diggers and Dozers"" so much.  That was a five star flick.  These Canadians can sure make good truck videos.  I only gave Lights and Ladders four stars because the fire house portion was a little flat.  Other than that it's great.
I should add that my two and a half year old son loves this video too and gives it five stars.  Much more mileage than both Curious George and Thomas combined.",1209427200,,953,4.416184971098266

8178544,5,B000NJMJYS,"Fantastic Mighty Machines DVD! Product arrived brand new in a sealed DVD case. Great quality and price. My 3 y/o received this on Easter and has watched it about 15 times, no joke! I don't mind watching it with him, just wish they would remake the Mighty Machine series with updated trucks and equipment but thats a completely different topic. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys watching fire trucks, street sweepers, stump grinders, cherry pickers, garbage trucks, etc.",1523318400,,490,4.987804878048781

He's ASD so he's particular about everything.  The case was in great shape, the covers were not marked and still vibrant.  The DVD in great shape.  He's watching it right now again for the third time.  It came on time (thankfully, because I didn't order until late).  He couldn't wait to pull it from the package!",1490054400,,487,4.274725274725275
