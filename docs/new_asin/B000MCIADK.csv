2728140,4,B000MCIADK,"I really love this movie. The story is simple, but heartfelt. Crystal Kwok is just beautiful and wonderful as a recently graduated young girl who returns to her village in rural China, and grapples with whether she should believe in Jesus or be part of the political system. She wavers one way and then the other, asks difficult questions and is sceptical of the answers until the abuses of the political system drive her to faith.",1238025600,10,431,4.684210526315789
2728141,5,B000MCIADK,"The Modern Day Book Of Acts! We Should All Be So Blessed To Experience This Film And Far More Blessed To Experience Persecution Such As What Is Presented In This Film. Key Points On Why This Movie Is Above Most/If Not All Most So Called ""Christian Films:""

1) Scripturally Based, Solid Doctrine Used & Presented In Films Entirety.

2) Accurate & Factual Information On Christians In China, The Chinese Communist Party, And How They Treat/Deal With Christians And Other Chinese In The Country.

3) Excellent Acting And Overall Performance.

I Would Recommend This Movie To Any Christian, From: Well Rooted In The Faith To The Babies In The Faith (Such As Myself), To Even The Luke Warm Majority That Think They're Saved. This Movie Will Cause You To Examine Yourself (2 Cor 13:5) And Start To Hopefully 'Make Every Effort To Walk The Narrow Path.'

See This Movie Christian Or Not, Be Encouraged.",1174867200,32,895,4.823529411764706
8167761,5,B000MCIADK,"Please, more movies like this one. My family fled the Cuban revolution and I was raised Catholic, but in USA comfort, my father scoring a job with the government, and materialism snared me in its comfortable sexual cynical web so that although I loved Christ and believed in Him, I didn't feel urgently compelled to follow him because I was so grateful I wasn't stuck in atheist Cuba, closing church after church and imprisoning its citizens.,  I was free to live the American dream, where Christianity was watered down to some cool soda pop Jesus and reality was scientific materialism - just like in China, but much more subtle - still sticking to Christian values even while dismissing them deep down. The church may be dwindling in the States, but it is growing in China, Africa, the Middle East, and dreams are involved. Lucid dreams is how the Holy Spirit came to me. Miracles are happening everywhere all the time. Excellent - blessedly smaltz free - film.",1524873600,,963,4.766467065868263

8167764,5,B000MCIADK,I love this video... and have bought several to give away.  Very simple Christian message.  And a good insight on the life in China in the 1990's in rural China.,1432771200,,161,4.333333333333333

8167767,4,B000MCIADK,this DVD showed the reality of persecution and is worth getting; the ending could have been improved as it was rather abrupt,1316908800,2,124,4.681818181818182
8167768,4,B000MCIADK,"The only reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5, is because, even though it is excellent, it is also very disturbing; and it should be disturbing.  You will not read in the media about the way China treats it's citizens, especially those who profess Jesus Christ. And to see this movie portraying persecution of Christians, brings it closer to home.  We still have some religious freedom in the USA, but it is rapidly eroding, and in the end, God will give us the strength to face whatever happens, just as He did for the young girl in Bamboo in Winter, which is based on a true story.",1276041600,7,585,4.3577981651376145
8167769,5,B000MCIADK,"A truly moving picture of man (in this particular case a woman is the key character) adding the third and vital part of the trinity that makes a human whole. Many have body and mind but most in this world are limited to being just that - two thirds of what God created them to be. This story is a real example of the transforming power of God's third part, the Holy Spirit working in the life of the young college graduate possessing a wonderful mind and a body at it's physical peak; she is transformed from bold, independent, pretty, smart and lost to a gracious, generous, loving, complete child of God. She recognizes that nothing this world has to offer compares to the joy of knowing Jesus Christ personally. She no longer questions her purpose or fears her future. All is known and even in the valleys that inevitably lie on the road ahead of her, she will not falter in the new, real, vibrant faith that has become her all in all. It will move those with ears to hear to truth that has been setting captive hearts free from the beginning of God's creation. Watch this great film with an open heart - that God shaped missing third of you just might be filled and if it has already been filled you'll be blessed and encouraged by the testimony of how God works in ways that are beyond worldly comprehension. God is truly the the great ""I Am"" the only one who truly completes us. (yes, Tom I'm afraid it's true!)",1259107200,4,1417,4.371212121212121
