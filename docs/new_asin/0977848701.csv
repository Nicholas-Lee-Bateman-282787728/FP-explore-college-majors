7794842,5,0977848701,"My middle school students were glued to the screen the ENTIRE time while watching this true account of Henry Box Brown. It was hard for many of them to believe to lengths he took to ensure his freedom. I learned more about Henry Box Brown than I already previously knew. The narration by actress Alfre Woodard was phenomenal and engaging! We also enjoyed the ""Extras"" and had a great discussion about what it meant to be a slave and what it meant to be free.

I recommend this video for parents and teachers to use, but not just for purposes of educating young people about this man's determination to be a free man and not a slave, but about what it means to persevere through adversity.",1462233600,,688,4.4603174603174605

7794845,3,0977848701,"I received this DVD in a timely manner.  The story of Henry Box Brown was told in a poem format. Although I feel
it is wonderful to tell stories of our African Ancestors, sometimes how it is presented takes away from the seriousness
of their plight, While I give credit to the producers of this DVD, I feel our children need to be presented with a less
jovial picture and see how truly dangerous it was for Henry to do what he did. I did not like the talking animals and
the light-heartedness of this DVD.  Now, it must be kept in mind that I am reviewing the actual DVD, not the seller.
The seller did their job and did a great job at that!",1393804800,3,641,4.12
7794846,5,0977848701,"Great little video. I bought another by the same company Blackberry. They produced ""Garrett's Gift, the story of inventor Garrett Morgan. He was the inventor of the stop light. This video is about Henry ""Box"" Brown. He mailed himself to freedom. Great story! These videos make explaining about African American history easy for the youngest viewer. I teach lower elementary and these videos are entertaining as well as informative. I hope the video company continues on their journey with the best. This is a must have for any school library.",1301788800,,542,5.033333333333333
7794847,5,0977848701,"I first saw this film on HBO last February and have been hunting it down ever since. I am a kindergarten teacher and simply adore how this video was done---everything from the look to the content length was very appropriate for children five and up. It would be great for a four year old too with some parent question and answer time following the viewing. I will be using it in my classroom this year and am also going to purchase Garrett's Gift which is another story produced by the same company that chronicles the many inventions of Garrett Morgan including his most famous---the traffic light. This film was also featured on HBO and is now available on DVD. It is, as The Journey of Henry Box Brown, very appropriate for young children and also features some really great jazz music to accompany the film. Both DVDs are a must have in helping young children learn more about African American History.",1218585600,,906,4.633540372670807
