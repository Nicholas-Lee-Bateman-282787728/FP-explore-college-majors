8178957,4,B000NJVXAO,"I am a huge fan of the ""Bad Movie Police"" series and J. R. Bookwalter's early 1990's films in general. These two are on a single disc and lack some of the extras found on the first three releases in the series, but still have great commentary tracks.

""Zombie Cop"" stars the good-humored James Black as ""Doctor Death,"" a criminal made of pure evil who becomes embroiled in a battle with two police officers, one of whom, obviously, is freshly undead.

""Maximum Impact"" is the darker of the two, believe it or not. It concerns a mild-mannered businessman who becomes involved with a gang of sadistic thugs, resulting in extensive mayhem and bloodshed. It has some genuinely creepy moments, unlike the other films in the series, and is my least favorite of the five released thus far under the ""Bad Movie Police"" banner.

As always, the highlights of these films are the hilarious yet insightful commentary tracks, here featuring director and producer Bookwalter, producer Scott Plummer, and actors Ken Jarosz, Jo Norcia, and Bill Morrison. Although these are not my favorites of the series largely due to their distinctly lower camp value and higher horror content, they are recommended without qualification for either horror fans, or fans of low budget filmmaking.",1193529600,2,1265,4.985781990521327
