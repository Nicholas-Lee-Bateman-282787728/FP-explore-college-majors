94811,5,0790734419,"This tale of a Florida Black town and racism and hatred gone unchecked is one of the most powerful, emotional films I have ever seen.  You won't hear  about this tragic event in public school, that's for certain.  A  certifiable massacre, brought about by a WHITE woman's infidelities, this  movie still resounds in my head after only one viewing.  Ving Rhames as the  heroic ""Mr. Man"" helps save some of Rosewood's citizens from  slaughter, but he can't prevent the horror the white mob brings to the  town.  A haunting example of ignorance unchecked, it's hard to decide  whether this is a drama or a horror film.  Jon Voight's portrayal of the  reluctant shopkeeper is stellar, and the entire cast is wonderful.  John  Singleton makes great movies that sadly get overlooked.  This movie should  be known everywhere for it's unflinching depiction of a terrible stain on  America's history.  A film that would be dangerous to forget.",966816000,13,934,4.909677419354839
94812,5,0790734419,"This is a fantastic movie of which I knew nothing until a clerk in my rental accidently gave it to me, instead of a movie I wanted to rent. I noticed her mistake when I got home, but after watching this film I was  only glad that she made that mistake and pulled this movie from a drawer,  where it was stuck. It was not put on the shelves, I must say.... One of  the reviewers already gave brief synopsis, so I'll just add that I cried  throughout most of the film. I felt angry, sad and heavy with grief, but I  forced myself to watch it, no matter how much pain or shame I felt. I am  neither white american nor black, but the pain and the shame I felt are  universal emoitons.... two emotions all people should feel, after watching  this film...in this case these emotions are about humongous injustice that  passed unnoticed for so long...  Apart from a lesson to be learnt, this  film  also works well on all cinematic levels: story is told well, actors  are good, etc. Very powerful!",957916800,5,990,4.315217391304348
94813,4,0790734419,"This movie got me hot. It mad me mad at the way black people were treated back in the past. Watch this movie if you want to get heated and ready to knock the s**t out of somebody. Never forget your past, or you'll be doomed  to repeat it.",947894400,3,238,3.857142857142857
94814,5,0790734419,"It could be argued that some of the black characters are far from above reproach.  Esther Rolle's decision not to report the incident, Ving Rhames' (and others) desire to initially run from the conflict, or you could look  at the promiscuity of Don Cheadle's sister's character who has an  adulterous affair with Jon Voight.  Superficially these may appear to be  character flaws.  That is unless you account for the reality of pervasive  racism that  exists in America (forget about just the South) by both the  general populous and public officials in particular.  The harsh truth is  that black people didn't have the luxury to be (much) less than virtuous as  it could too often result in imprisonment, financial ruin, beatings or  lynchings.  And even with all of the so called virtue exhibited by the  black characters an accusation by a white woman was accepted even in lieu  of truths known by other white characters.  If that could happen to  characters who were above reproach I hate to imagine what would have  happened to less virtuous characters.  If they were virtuous it's only  because their very survival depended on it.  This theme has repeated itself  all too often and all too recently for a thinking individual to believe  that these types of incidents couldn't happen today.
The most deplorable  fact is how long it took for the government to even acknowledge the horror  and injustice of this and other events such as the destruction of Black  Wall Street in Kansas City.  That is another element of why blacks so often  had to conduct themselves in a seemingly reproachless manner.
And Mr.  Singleton need not be criticized for the 'stereotypical' portrayals of  southern racists.  It was and is accurate.  Just as it's accurate to  demonstrate that there were and are whites who were fair minded and  exhibited tremendous bravery of their own account.
There is nothing  'happy' about this movie at all.  Look at the countless number of lives  that were either ruined or ended because of our collective disease.  The  final conflict underscores the real tragedy that racism is.  It destroys  the lives and humanity of all it's participant's be they perpetrators or  victims.  How many children lost their parents?  How many individuals lost  their livelihood or savings?  How many families were destroyed?
That  notwithstanding it is a monumental achievment for Mr. Singleton if not  necessarily a cinematic masterpiece.  But who ever said that history has to  be exiciting or uplifting?  It's just what is.  For that Mr. Singleton  deserves the highest commendation just to get a film of this nature made  let alone telling a too often suppressed and ignored part of our history.  For that I give it 5 stars.  However, there are many nuances to the film  which I personally only recognized after multiple viewings.  It's an  experience that should be viewed, discussed and reflected upon.  That's  certainly something I can't say about much of what's coming out of  Hollywood today.
What I wonder about is how many actual Rosewood's have  occured that have never been recorded or recognized.",947203200,81,3116,4.974559686888454
94815,3,0790734419,"Rosewood's incendiary topic is historically-based and centers around a one-horse Florida town that in 1923 was the sight of a brutal white-on-black massacre. What a good movie can do is illuminate the  conflict, cast an eye on the suspicious and ultimately destructive forces  that laid seige to the town and set-off a wave of racist brutality.  The  quandry in this sort of movie is how to make a racist unique and avoid  stereotypes. Director John Singleton and screenwriter Gregory Poirer's  answers are inconclusive. Their gun-toting dolts chew ta-ba-kee, toss  around the n-word like a football, and wear suspenders that accentuate  their bloated beer-bellies. For the most part they're not real enough, but  the terror they perpetrate is.
Rhames is electrifying in a difficult  role; Voight is all nerves and nuance. John Singleton has, as usual, chosen  a provocative topic. It's a big screen natural. What weakens his work is  his inability to speak for a group while never forgetting the individual.  It's a tough balance, but Singleton's heroes are above reproach and thus  rarely believable. In this often stunning work, racial pride takes  precedence over moral complexity. Lessons can be taught less obviously than  that.",946339200,3,1234,5.251282051282051

94883,4,0790734419,"It sickens me how hateful and ignorant people actually were.  I am so fortunate I never had to witness injustice like this. I'm so glad I didn't live back in those times. I am half way through the film and not certain if I can continue. I watched it for the history, but am unsure if I can handle anything more violent than Ive seen so far. It begins with Jon Voight cheating on his wife by having sex with a young black woman.  **Spoiler *** almost too much violence by half time. Such as...1. When the man and boy shot the hog and dragged it behind them as they walked. 2. The woman who was beaten by the boyfriend, then cried rape. 3. The first young black man who had a rope around his neck. A bit too much for my taste so far, but decided to give it 15 more minutes before I quit. I quit. Much too violent for me.*** Half way there is a murdered young man who had his body parts cut off. The film is kind enough not to show this, but this is quite enough for me to continue.",1503705600,,979,3.989795918367347

94907,3,0790734419,My family is one of the only white families to have lived in Roeswood.  My great great grandfather was the sheriff.  He was the one that went from house to house telling people a Mon was coming. While he was trying to get people out of Roeswood he was shot by a member of the mob and died.  It saddens me that as the report above as one of the fact is that families got reparations....well since I am white I have not seen a dime...even though my family member died protecting the people of Roeswood.  My family goes to where Roeswood was located and we place flowers to honor throws who are gone.  Ot was an American tragedy that this happened.  All I have left of my grandfather is a cedar chest that he made while he live in Roeswood.  Please remember while watching this that these are real people with real stories to tell.  The director defiantly has used his creative license in this film.,1501804800,,896,4.323353293413174

94941,4,0790734419,"In 1923, a prosperous black town in Florida was burned to the ground, its people hunted and murdered, all because a white woman falsely claimed that a black man sexually assaulted her. This woman's husband knew deep down she was a tramp but chose not to face up to it. Shocking to learn another man who initiated,ignited the townspeople to violently react in this manner was aware of the truth from the beginning.

Hard to watch but a excellent movie. Great acting and storyline that's difficult to watch. The movie demonstrates just how cruel people can be when it comes racism. I'm a movie buff but had never seen this film. Heart wrenching to watch one human being treating another like an animal. Sparing no one, burying those they killed in a mass grave. The terrible acts that were committed reminded me of the horrible, mind boggling history of the holocaust.

One shining light was the young child who lost respect for his cruel, prejudiced father teaching him to follow in his footsteps by example utilizing  bullying tactics. This man was the worst of them all.",1491004800,4,1071,4.747311827956989

It is a reminder that for some it is difficult to separate racism from their religion. When hate takes over, nothing seems to stop it unless of course you have either 45 caliber pistols or a rifle in your reach. Wives kissing their husbands as if they are going off to war, and their men racing around trying to look as if they knew what they were doing, which was absurd.",1444608000,,505,4.382978723404255

The real shame is that learning of this atrocity is not required material for every child, to learn the history of our nation and of the terrible acts that were committed. We have idiots driving around with American and Confederate flags saying ""oh, it's not racist"" and they have absolutely no idea just how racist it really is.

This movie is a fantastic teaching tool to explain to children how things used to be and why they should never be that way again. This film is so good it invites you to research for yourself the facts about what happened to the town of Rosewood, Florida.

It is a strong raw look at the race riots of the 1920's and though it is Hollywood's view, it compliments the primary source newspaper accounts of race riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma 1921 and Detroit 1919. The film is a look at an era that is often looked over.",1403568000,,298,4.245614035087719
95519,5,0790734419,I saw this movie years ago but recently decided to view it again after having done extensive research on lynching over the past few years.  This movie matches the descriptions of the lynch mob mentality and how African Americans were systematically hunted and targeted for unspeakable violence.  Also notable is how Singleton showed the crushing of innocence of white children at the hands of their blood-thirsty parents and how racism was passed from one generation to the next.  This movie is library-worthy.,1400025600,,510,5.195121951219512

He chose to put blame where he lacked and it was the truth. He needed to see his wife as an wholesome lady, when he knew all along she was the town tramp.

95781,3,0790734419,"The problem with Rosewood, based on a massacre that happened in 1923 after a black man allegedly beat and raped a white woman, is that it goes on for too long. Its a few days condensed to about 140 minutes, but the plot couldve rolled more productively in two-thirds the time.

Theres lots of unnecessary filler, including subtle hints of a very unnecessary romance, but the action scenes; if black people being lynched, shot and hung qualifies as such; are generally worth the wait. If its not entertainment, its at least something interesting to watch.

Ill just add that the south back then wasn't only filled with racists; the whites were racist toward the blacks and the blacks were racist right back; but also sexists and ageists as the lives of men were considered expendable in comparison to the lives of women and children.

95782,5,0790734419,"Historically the film may not be completely accurate but for the most part the film is dead on and for such a topic as extreme racism and ignorance this film hits it all on the head. The film is set in the 1920's directed by John Singleton of (Boyz in The Hood) fame, the plot erupts when a white woman tells a vicious lie, and the lie spreads like wildfire affecting the entire community of Rosewood and especially the black community. That is a very brief synopsis without giving away the story and the twists that occur along the way. Expet alot of tears and anger while watching the film, i don't think there has ever been a story like rosewood depicted in hollywood and i doubt there will ever be another that accurately tells the truth, not pointing fingers at  a paticular group but simply tells the truth. The film is one of the most accurate films i have seen that does not lose ones attention, with a brilliant cast, Esther Rolle, Jon Voight, Ving Rhames and Don Cheadle. Its definately a film that will have you thinking and should be shown in schools and not only for black history month.

During the attack, survivors estimated, as many as eighteen African-Americans and two European-Americans were. Most of the buildings, including churches and a school, were burned. The community was abandoned and, in spite of permanent loss of land and homes, the citizens never returned. Women and children were rescued, as shown in this film, by the crew of the train that regularly stopped at the village. Given the three days of carnage, news of the events reached national newspaper attention. Reporters actually began to arrive on the scene. The governor of Florida was alarmed and asked the nearest local authorities if help was wanted from the National Guard; the sheriff replied that he didn't want help. After the event, the governor did convene an inquest, but no prosecutions or efforts to assist the refugees resulted.

Even without further attention from the outside world, the Rosewood Massacre would have been one of the most atrocious and obvious acts of ethnic/racial ""cleansing"" in America's history. In 1992, however, a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times uncovered evidence of the fate of Rosewood and published a story. That story led to national scrutiny. In 1993, aged survivors descendants of survivors of the Massacre sued the state of Florida for compensation. Confronted by undeniable evidence, the Florida Legislature passed a compensation bill of $2,100,000 and established a scholarship fund for Rosewood descendants. Public opinion in Florida was incensed at such acknowledgement of racism in the state's past; letters written to the legislators ran ten to one against any compensation or recognition of the truth.

95873,4,0790734419,"The event this movie was based on was so despicable that John Singleton (Director) had to add in fictional characters so it wouldn't look as shameful as Rosewood really was.

Some fictitious elements were...

1. Mann's (Ving Rhames) character was 200% fiction.  Not even loosely BASED on any historical person.  So the ending, when Mann was shooting at the mob from the train...never happened.

2. The emotional distraught of the racist Duke's (Bruce McGill) son, Emmit, was fictional and not based on anything historic.  Added for dramatic purposes obviously.

3. Sylvester (Don Cheatle) died in real life during the shootout and did not return heroically on a horse beside the train to pick Mann up.

As far as I know, the rest if pretty accurate..

In reality, during massacres like Rosewood, the heroes like Mann and Sylvester were the first to die.  But I knew when I saw him escape the lynching, cutting himself down, and shooting at mob when he was escaping on the train that his character was based on ""some"" fiction.  But then I found out his WHOLE character was fictional.  Singleton had to create a hero, or else Black folks would be killing people when the movie was over.  I wouldn't blame them.  I remember I could hardly sleep the night I saw the movie.  And during events like this, not one person faced any charges.  Not one!

Jon Voight, as always, gave a hell of a performance.  His character, John Wright, is obviously racist, but not a bigot.  But when he witnesses the lynching of folks he's known for years in his face, he has a change of heart and arranges his friends who owns the train that passes Rosewood to pick up the Black women and children.

Michael Rooker, as Sheriff Walker, did a great job as the law who could not control his town.  He, too, was racist, but still wanted order.

The Black Preacher in the movie was the typical religious Uncle Tom.  Proving Karl Marx's theory of religion's role in oppressive societies correct (as being the drug to keep oppressed people satisfied with a belief of an after-life).

Read about Black Wallstreet too.  I'd like to see a Director make a movie about that.

95874,5,0790734419,"Based on a true story of a historic outbreak of racist violence, ""Rosewood"" is a compelling movie even without the social significance.  The storyline is basically that a white woman falsely accuses a black man of rape, causing a whole town to go nuts.  Certain of the white citizens form a mob to administer ""justice"" and end up on a rampage, while 2 men try to hide the black citizens of the town and help them escape.

""Rosewood"" has many of the same emotional elements (heroism, cowardice, hatred, loss of control vs. disciplined honor, plenty of emotional tension) of ""Schindler's List"" or the old version of ""Titanic,"" ""A Night to Remember.""  Director John Singleton keeps the action moving, by keeping the more sensitive scenes short, and actually increasing their impact by his brevity.

John Voight is very believable as a reluctant hero, playing a shopkeeper who risks losing everything to help the terrified women and children of the town.  Ving Rhames does a good job as a black man returned from war who serve's as Voight's conscience and handles the action scenes.

A surprise stand-out is Bruce McGill (D-Day in Animal House, the sheriff in My Cousin Vinny) as the ""leader"" of the white mob.  McGill is convincing as one of the most disgusting characters I've ever seen on film.  He brings out the truly foul nature of hate, but manages to humanize his character by showing the personal costs of his hate as well as the social forces which led him to it.  The result is that you think he actually is the character he portrays.  The movie is worth it just for McGill's creepy character.",1126828800,11,1600,4.740072202166065
95875,5,0790734419,"Based on actual events, Rosewood relates the events that led to as many as 150 African Americans being murdered and burned out of their homes in Rosewood, Florida in 1923, by whites from a neighboring town.  All this happens because a white woman falsely accused a black man of raping her.

Truly a horrific tale, all the more so because it happened, although an accurate death count has never been determined.  This sad account went unknown for many years due to a cover up as well as resident's refusal to talk abou the events.  Director John Singleton probably takes a worst case scenario view of the body count and pure horror with burning bodies being hung by the neck and other such gruesome crimes.

Caught up in this chaotic story is Ving Rhames playing Mann, a former soldier who was merely passing through town and ends up having to fight for his life as well as heroically saving a number of children from the marauding racists.  Don Cheadle gives an outstanding performance as a Rosewood resident who proves smarter than the rednecks.

Jon Voight plays a local business owner who is sympathetic to the blacks and for that is labeld a ""_____"" lover by the other whites.  But Voight doesn't care and actually provides a safe harbor to several blacks after the attack begins.

Michael Rooker, who also played in Mississippi Burning gives a fine performance as sheriff Walker who while racist himself, finally realizes that the accusations were false but by then is unable to stop the mayhem.  Bruce McGill is the typical, fat, white redneck as Duke Purdy.

The film is beautifully shot and John Jenson deserves a big tip of the hat for his cinematography as he captured the small-town, ramshackle look of 1920's Florida that greatly lent to the film's look of authenticity.  Very powerful film. So sad yet an important film for people to watch, especially our young people as incidents like this should never be forgotten.",1109548800,42,1931,4.783132530120482

Whereas many innocent people most African Americans are killed, the touching drama of the story is how a black man and a white man lead a group of displaced black women and children to safety.  The scenes to capture the spirit on how African Americans have overcome some much prejudice and hardship.

Its good to see taht our prsent generation has preached toelrace for one's fellow man.  Lets hope that this continues an that movies like Rosewood can hopefully continue to educate people into the evils of prejudice.",1100563200,16,765,4.588235294117647
95897,5,0790734419,"I watched ""Rosewood"" in Texas when it came out in 1997.  Unfortunately, it was not well received at the time - in fact, I found it really difficult to find a theatre that featured the film.  Much like ""Roots"", this is a pivital movie, giving the viewers a snapshot of true events that occurred in Florida in 1922.  Of course some artistic license is taken.  At times, Vingh Raimes seems more like a super hero character....but the racist attitudes of the period seem to be accurately represented.  One other note, I just read the rant about republicans verses democrats and I have this to say.  It's funny how in modern times the republican party seems to celebrate the ""retro"" sensibilities of the 1950's when blacks just happened to be forced to ride on the back of the bus and received separate and unequal schooling. And when blacks also provided cheap labor as 2nd class citizens for whites who wanted to maintain their status as 1st class citizens of these United States....funny, no one really ever talks about how that power structure provided a world for middle class whites to flourish in before the modern civil rights movement took hold....a lopsided world missed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, but I digress....Anyway, the author of that rant fails to mention that during the 1960's, racist ""Dixiecrats"" like Strom Thurmond left the democratic party to join with the republicans who accepted him with open arms. And recently before his death, Strom was celebrated by fellow republican Trent Lott who wished aloud that Strom had been president. - When I lived in Texas, the people I knew who regularly used racial slurs, and drove around with confederate flag license plates always (and I mean always) claimed to be republican when the subject of politics came up.  The democratic party is no perfect party, but trying to make the republican party seem like a refuge and oasis for blacks just because Abe Lincoln once was a member is just plain ignorant!!!!",1099094400,19,1989,4.81524926686217
95898,3,0790734419,"This film reminds us of the horrors that the Southern Democrats inflicted upon African Americans. As Wayne Perryman reminds us in his book, ""Unfounded Loyalties"",

""One party and their abolitionist supporters believed the Bible instructed them to lay down their lives for the slaves, the other party and their supporters believed the Bible gave them the right to take the lives of blacks if they rebelled against being slaves.

...

""One party was heavily influenced by the Abolitionists and the radical wing of their party ... and the other party was influenced by the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups.

""One party and its supporters started the Freedman's Bureau and other programs to help build communities for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices to hinder those efforts and to destroy those communities (Wilmington, North Carolina).

""One party and its supporters established quality schools and colleges for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices that attempted to close some of those schools or diminish their quality.

""One party passed laws and Constitutional Amendments (13th , 14th , 15th) to include blacks as part of mainstream society, the other party passed laws to exclude them from the mainstream (Jim Crow Laws and Black Codes). ...""

Sadly, many do not know that that ""one party"" was the Republican Party, while the ""other party"" was the Democratic Party. I myself didn't know at the time I watched this stirring film. I suppose burning crosses make us assume the bad guys are aligned with the religious right. Unfortunately, the ""other party"" used a nonsensical interpretation of the ""curse of Ham"" to justify slavery; fortunately, ""one party"" saw through it.

This film is also a great example of how history is being rewritten or dumbed down. While many films have shown lynchings and other abuse of African Americans, they usually leave you with the impression that the bigots were ""Bible bashers"" ... as you can see, this is only half the truth. Very rarely are we reminded that it was Republicans who laid their lives on the line to defend blacks, based on their Christian faith.

We are all sinners. Perhaps the shameful past that the Democrats are trying to forget - indeed, most youngsters today do not need to forget, they haven't even been taught - will spur them onto greater deeds that may even outshine the ""one party"".",1088640000,8,2415,4.987562189054726

95900,5,0790734419,"""Rosewood"", starring Jon Voight and Ving Rhames, is a gripping true story about an all African-American town that was burned by an all white lynch mob in 1923, which killed many.  Its powerful message sends an eyeopening attack in audiences' hearts.  The filmmakers deserve tremendous respect for deeply exploring these chain of events to such levels.  This was highly necessary for people to understand the impact of violence and racism.  The intensity is so groundbreaking that it forces audiences inside the movie.  Their research is highly obvious, making it very educational.  The movie plot is brilliant, keeping the heart and soul alive in every scene:
A small town, Rosewood, is usually a peaceful, loving town.  In New Years Eve 1922, everything functioned as usual.  Around that time, a woman from a nearby town, Sumner, falsely accuses a black person of raping and assaulting her (it was actually a white man, but there was no rape).  Once word is out, all hell breaks loose.
The recreation of the town is perfect.  Every detail is flawless, including the styles of the early 1920's.  Every building structure and creation is flawless.  The costume designs are as flawless, looking like actual 1920's clothing.
The acting was intensely great.  Everyone offers their own heart and soul sense into this movie, making it more powerful.  Jon Voight and Ving Rhames capitalize the acting talents.  This is Rhames's best role in years.  His tough warrior image never fades for a second, which is very convincing.  His presentd talents were wrongfully overlooked in the 1997 Acadamy Awards for Best Supporting Actor.  Jon Voight's role as a man who comes to terms of what a true ally is.  His heartdrenching role forces audiences to feel his character's learning progress and emotions.
""Rosewood"" is a great movie for those looking for an factual intense drama.  This will surely educate audiences about reality.  This movie will become a classic in the near following years as it deserves.",1077148800,16,1994,5.0552147239263805

After watching the movie we took a ride to the site that was once Rosewood, the only remaining structure is mr. Wrights house, the town is gone, we walked through the area that was once Rosewood and tried to imagine it as it was in the movie, we then went to Sumner and saw the site that was once the mill,we found some relics there, along with some buildings that had housed the residents of Sumner who worked in the mill, we then visited Mr. Wrights grave in Sumner, all in all the movie was great as it taught my family and myself about the history of the town and how horrible racism was back then.",1075334400,62,873,4.2023809523809526
95902,3,0790734419,"Director John Singleton gets his opportunity to direct an epic black film in Rosewood and define himself as a black director. Unfortunately in this clumsy, clunky incomplete mess of a movie he shows us why he will never measure up to the high standards of black filmmaking Spike Lee established years ago with his definitive films, Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X.
The devil is in the details and they are a lot missing in Rosewood. In this story about a successful black town, the story focuses way too much on the white characters. A better director and screenwriter would have shown us a blanked and clear picture of what life was like in Rosewood Florida. I wanted to know why the African Americans lived in the town why they wanted to come there, what jobs they did, and who they were. Unfortunately Singleton doesn't answer any of these questions. Instead, he glosses over these details and gives us a hazy picture of a town that looks like any other in Jim Crow America. Worse he fills it with one-dimensional stock black characters. We get the old mammy, the schoolmarm, the angry black businessman and the new guy in town trying to start a new life for himself.  Even the white characters come off like White Southern stereotypes. The liberal shopkeeper, the redneck killer, the nervous sheriff, the indifferent judge and the evil white woman get a lot of screen time but do nothing with it. The story completely starts to fall apart after the white woman lies about the rape. The white characters go on a campy lynching rampage that is reminiscent of Godzilla destroying Tokyo; it's sad that John Singletons inept direction trivializes the tragic deaths of African Americans who were lynched during this era. This film is supposed to be based on real life events and real people and they are treated like action movie fodder by Singleton.  People we're supposed to care about die, but I didn't get to feel that way because I never got to know anyone because Singleton forgot to let us get to know anyone well enough in the first act of the film. The surviving women and children try to escape the rampage by hiding in the swamp. The remainder of the film devolves into a Jerry Bruckhiemer production as stuff burns up real good and we get a big chase scene as they try to get on a train out of town.  The part of the film that angers me most is the scene where the Ving Rhames character is being lynched. He tells his horse Booker T to go and then allows himself to be hung; however while being strangled he miraculously cuts himself down and escapes. This one scene shows us why Singleton will never be a great filmmaker; instead of giving us powerful visuals in a compelling story he treats the source material like a joke. This was supposed to be a film about real people who lived and died in a tragedy not some over the top action flick like Lethal Weapon.
It's a pity that great actors like Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Don Cheadle and the Late Esther Rolle had to work with Singleton on this project. They give good performances in spite of the shallow material. I wonder what they could have done with a better-written script and a more competent director. The material itself was very interesting and the project had a lot of potential. In the hands of Spike Lee, James Cameron, or Steven Spielberg this truly could have been an epic film. With them directing the film we would have gotten a clear picture of who the people were and what life was like in Rosewood Florida. For John Singleton this is truly a definitive film.  When given the tools to make a great film he makes something awful. This is not his Roots. This shows why he needs to go back to film school and learn the roots of filmmaking.",1072396800,,3717,4.535022354694486

It's hard for me as a person to watch this movie and not begin to have racist feelings to white people. But you know what i can't condem all white people as being this way because that's rediculoues. Yesterday or today i was watching the Movie ""Tears of the Sun"" Staring bruce willous and i don't know the whole story but my main focus was on these soilders that were white and there was a black dude in there also that were fighting some kind of war and i wish i knew what it was about but what i was looking at mostly in my mind and what i saw in the movie was these white soilders fighting to save these Libyan black people from these disgusting black libyan soilders that were killing the civilans for some reason. And i asked my self while i was watching this would i do the same thing for people that were white and it was a quick answer and they answer was yes. It kinda shocked me because it was no longer about white and black it was about right and wrong. The answer is i would without hesitating. If it was white people that were slaves in america under black people i would kill black slave owners and fight in a civil war to free white people in this country or any other. And this is what white people felt like when they fought in the civil war against the south. I now know that racism like homophobia is a bunch of bull. It's stupid . It really is stupid and i now don't even understand  why someone would want to hate someone because they are different than you.

95930,5,0790734419,"I loved this movie!  It's a historical drama, a social/political film, a character study, an exploration in the worst & best in human behavior, & a downright great action film!
I call this film ""A Later Day Western"" for several reasons.  First, it has a historical setting.  (Obviously, however, since it takes place in the '20's & NOT in the West, it can't rightfully be called a ""Western"", but I'll get to the similarities in a second!)  Second, like many great westerns, it examines social problems in a historical setting.  Third, though it has ""heroes"" & ""villains"", the good-guys aren't all good (Voight has serious character flaws & is gripped by fear, but he ultimately does ""the right thing"") & the bad-guys have real ""human"" motivations.  (The villain of the story is a dysfunctional, but loving father.)  Finally, The Ving Rhames character (admittedly, a fictional character), is a strong-willed, wandering veteran (on horse-back), trying to find peace, but reluctantly forced to make a stand for right.
The story is based loosely on the actual Rosewood Massacres of 1923 & it delivers on all counts.
My personal favorite character is John Voight's young (2nd) wife, who stands up to the bigots & earns the respect of her step-children.
This film, unlike many other films about race-prejudice, is BALANCED, showing not just ""bad rednecks"", but decent (Caucasian) neighbors of the local African-americans being (unjustly) persecuted for a ""rape"" of a white woman (which, by the way, never really happened.)  This movie reminded me of both ""Bad Day At Black Rock"" & ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""  Those were two great films & by combining elements from them with a real historical event (tragedy) with a strong cast, good script, & fast-paced direction makes for a great film!
It's too bad that this film wasn't a bigger hit.  If you buy this video, you WON'T be wasting your money.  It's not just a later-day western, it's a later-day classic.",1016928000,10,1948,4.963076923076923
95931,3,0790734419,"Shrtly before this film came out, I wrote an article on the actual Rosewood and Tulsa massacres. The film shows the destruction as being far worse than what it actually was and that business about John Voights affair with Miss Bousia and the character of ""Mr. Man"" never happened. This was dramatic license. However, if you want the real facts about the Rosewood Massacre, read Michael D'Orso's ""Like Judgement Day"" upon which this movie is based.
One of the other reviewers asked how many other Rosewoods were there. The answer was THOUSANDS between the 1860s and 1960s. Read  Ralph Ginzburg's ""100 Years of Lynchings"" for similar stories in other cities and towns. Also read Scott Ellsworth's ""Death in a Promised Land"" about the Tusla Massacre of 1921, which has yet to be filmed about aside from scant mention in some documentaries.",1006128000,19,836,4.929078014184397

Based on a true story of a small town in Florida in the 1920s where a white woman falsely accused a black man of raping her (it was really a white lover who beat her) and it resulted in a lynch mob on all the black people.  Excellent if not disturbing.,985651200,5,379,4.236111111111111
95935,4,0790734419,"Rosewood shows what happens when hatred runs unchecked, and how one lie, combined with hate, envy, and racial enmity, led to the destruction of an African American township in Florida.  As powerful as the movie is, the true story of Rosewood was probably even worse, given that the level torture, mutilation, and brutality inflicted on the Black residents of the town could never be properly put on-screen and released by a Hollywood studio.  The ratings system wouldn't allow it, and movie theaters don't want their patrons to get sick and leave the theater.
If there was any ""silver lining"" in this movie version of a horrid episode in American history, it is that Rosewood did an admirable job of reflecting what true mature manhood is all about.  True manhood in the movie is shown when men (Don Cheadle & Ving Rimes) provide for, serve, and protect their families and communities from outside forces of evil that seek to destroy them.  Don Cheadle's character was willing to give his life so his wife and family could escape from the lynch mob, and Mr. Mann was willing to sacrifice himself to get women, children, and elders to safety.  True manhood is exhibited when Mr. Mann takes a frightened young boy, gives him responsibility, and turns him into a leader.  True manhood also involves chosing to do the right thing despite your own personal prejudices and societal/peer pressure, as reflected by Jon Voight's character, and even in the brief scene of a lawman and his posse who turn back the lynch mob at the county line.  False manhood is reflected by the ringleader of the lynch mob, who tried to teach his son that manhood was composed learning how to torture, shoot, and kill other humans beings like animals, as well as drinking and acting like a fool. Ultimately, his son rejected that version of manhood.  Manhood may not be a popular topic in our politically correct times, but it was good to see a movie showing men exhibiting mature manhood by standing up to tyranny and evil and doing the right thing for their families and communities.
Rosewood is a powerful movie that angers and saddens you when you realize the events depicted on screen actually occured (and were far worse), but also encourages you when you see how a people can survive in the midst of murderous chaos when men stand up and be men.
To see the actual results of racially-inspired lynchings, torture, and murder, take a look at the lynching photography book ""Without Sanctuary"", or read ""Rituals of Blood"" by Orlando Patterson.  The scenes in ""Rosewood"" will pale by comparison.",972864000,75,2570,4.809523809523809
