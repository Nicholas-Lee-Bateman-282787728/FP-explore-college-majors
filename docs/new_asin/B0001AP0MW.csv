1985803,5,B0001AP0MW,"Wow- More than I expected from a movie.. Not only is there a plot, but it challenges your faith and teaches that miracles can also come from human relationships. The cast shines, especially Mare Winningham and Rueben Blades. I highly recommend this gem from first time director Salma Hayek..",1098662400,13,291,4.959183673469388
1985804,5,B0001AP0MW,"My husband and I loved this movie. He only watches action flicks, so I was so pleased that he got interested in this sweet film the other night when I turned it on.  What a beautiful story.  We all need to believe in miracles and this film reminds us of that fact.  I can't wait to share this great find with my friends and family.",1093392000,7,331,4.061538461538461
1985805,5,B0001AP0MW,"My wife and I watch wide varieties of epic drama, humor, musical and far too many violent dramas like Braveheart! This simple but profound story based upon the 12 yr old Mexican lad is greatly contrasted with all the others yet soon reaches out to tug at  the heart! Peter Fonda is the cooler counter-part for his sister Jane. Yet so keenly fitted as the low-key Catholic Priest and care-giver for young Jose` who slowly encounters a Helper for his dog and himself! I thought Ruben Blades and Mare Winningham were great drama fill-ins for contrasting their fascinating  stories alongside the Latino flavor of Jose. What a wonderfully spinning out of this simple but beautiful ending surprisingly wrapped-up for Mystery. We were Awed with Salma Hayek as first-time Director! Another Big Plus for retiree Chaplain Fred W Hood",1086652800,15,823,4.956521739130435
1985806,5,B0001AP0MW,"The Maldonado Miracle is a very good movie.  I watched it thinking I wouldn't like it, but in the end, I wanted to see it again.  The world needs more movies like this, with good morals and good plots.  There are too many movies out there with too much crap and filled with nothing but that.  The Maldonado Miracle is filled with goodness and good teachings.  I recomend this movie to everyone.",1084233600,6,394,4.416666666666667
1985817,4,B0001AP0MW,Good for a family movie night at church!  That's how we used it!  There was no cursing or other 'bad words' in the movie.,1273190400,,121,4.0
1985818,5,B0001AP0MW,"This  was one of the greatest most inspirational movies i have ever seen! it tells alot about the hardships of illegal immagrants which were shown by flashbacks. This particular story was about a 12 year old boy named Jose Maldonado Alvarez(Eddy Martin),along with his trusted dog Sanchez, who crossed the border of Mexico into the United States in search of his father, Hector Maldonado Alvarez, who sent him. Along the way he accidently causes a ""miracle"" in a dying town called San Ramos. The once nearly vacant town becomes crowded with visitors wanting to see the miracle. Jose must now confess.
  I would encourage anyone who watches this movie, to read the book. The book (as it usually is) was better than the movie because the movie had an alternative ending, and the movie skipped a few important parts. All in all this movie was great. Thanks for reading my review!",1272153600,3,876,4.788079470198675
1985819,5,B0001AP0MW,"I found this film on the shelf of the public library.  I had never heard of it and didn't expect much from Salma Hayak as a director.  However the cast:  Ruben Blades, Peter Fonda and Mare Winningham assured me that this must have some value.  Still, as I put it in the DVD player I feared it would be another sappy inspirational film, maybe a take off on the wonderful Milagro Beanfield War (which also featured Blades).

One of the good things about a DVD is you can always turn it off if you don't like it, so I took a chance.  At first I was still skeptical--another Mexican border town sentimental tale.  But I quickly got into it and, in very little time I was hooked.  The cast really helps.  Peter Fonda is an excellent priest!  His quiet gravity was charming, and yes, he is always sexy.  Mare Winningham has a relatively easy job, playing a stock character--the down-to-earth plain talking cafe owner with a heart of gold, but she does it perfectly, so no complaints there.  Ruben Blades, long a favorite of mine, is the rumpled looking bar owner, whose periodic small advances toward her have always met with her usual salty rejections.  The fact that they manage to progress past that point is one of the many miracles that occurs when the town is shaken up by the presence of blood on the crucifix in the church. There is a scene between them when Blades asks her if he can still come back and eat eggs at the diner, in which he is to-die-for adorable!

 The hero, is a small Mexican illegal who has crossed the border looking for his father.  He is played by a wonderful boy who, with Hayak's direction, avoids making the part overly cute or sentimental.

The story unfolds naturally and all of the major and minor players do a great job in contributing to the color and activity of the film.

In short the film is a simple reminder of the human need for hope, sometimes coming by signs and wonders.  I laughed and cried and was totally uplifted by watching it.  Cynics will hate it but that's their loss.  I highly recommend it to anyone who still possesses the ability to believe in miracles.",1218844800,2,2108,4.4516971279373365
1985820,4,B0001AP0MW,"I love movies that are simple and inspirational. This movie is one of those.  The setting is a town breathing its last breath and many of the local town folks are dealing with important life struggles.  Something unusual breathes new life into the town and the towns people.  Was it a coincidence or a miracle?

The acting is good, setting perfect and characters people can relate too.",1212969600,6,385,4.701492537313433
1985821,5,B0001AP0MW,"I used this with an adult church group. We worked around the question of, 'What is a miracle?' Everyone enjoyed it and discussion afterwards was lively. We came to the conclusion that God works many more subtle miracles in the everyday lives of people than spectacular events that are contrary to nature. Our group enjoyed this low budget film much more than such well known films as ""Amazing Grace"" and ""The Nativity Story.""",1206921600,5,425,4.835616438356165
1985822,5,B0001AP0MW,"While I try to steer clear of movies involving an extremely heavy religious message, I do occasionally gamble on a positive message involving film That may have religious undertones. Maldonado Miracle is not only the latter, but is a true masterpiece of human drama. By the film's end, we see a far more pleasing miracle than the appearance of the blood on the Christ statue that sets the stage for most of the film. It is a miracle of how the boy is rewarded for his perserverance, and the wonderful element of what appears to be chance that makes it all happen. Everyone performs above expectation, especially the boy. If you need a pick me up movie with excellent acting and direction, Maldonado Miracle should be high on your list.",1206144000,4,735,4.661538461538462
1985823,4,B0001AP0MW,"""The Maldonado Miracle"" is the story of a small and sleepy former mining town coming back to life, demonstrating how oftentimes people fail to see what's right in front of them. This is Salma Hayek's directorial debut, and I look forward to seeing more of her work. Peter Fonda is Father Russell, who is at a turning point in his life, as are most of the other major players. The relationship between bar owner Cruz (Ruben Blades) and coffee shop owner Maisie (Mare Winningham) is especially charming. The essential plot revolves around a young boy (Eddy Martin) in search of his father, hiding in the church with his dog. I'm keeping this information cryptic so as not to provide any spoilers. Suffice it to say that this portrayal is well done, with fine actors and the occasional surprise humor. It won't change your life, but it may uplift an evening.",1123200000,15,855,4.706666666666667
1985824,4,B0001AP0MW,"Salma Hayak's freshman directorial attempt is an entertaining film.  She comments in the DVD feature interview that it is difficult for women directors in Hollywood because it is a male-dominated profession.  However, this effort shows promise.  She also talks about how she searched to find Eddy Martin who plays Jose.  In his only screen role to date, Eddy does a fine job as the young boy who illegally crosses the border, befriended only by his dog, into a different American world.  Peter Fonda was first nominated for an Oscar as a screenwriter for ""Easy Rider"" in 1969.  It wasn't until his nomination for best actor in 1997 as the beekeeper in ""Ulee's Gold"" that his minimalist acting style was recognized for the intensity it generates on screen.  As Father Russell, he is a quiet brooding priest, about at a crisis of faith, who shepherds the small struggling church in San Ramos.  His performance is adept as in the scene where he faces reporters who want to know if there were a miracle.  Father Russell isn't sure and we see all the levels of conflict flash across Fonda's face as he considers what he believes, what he knows & what he should be saying.  Mare Winningham was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for ""Georgia"" in 1995.  As the diner proprietor Maisie, she shows great tenderness to the little boy Jose, attraction for Cruz, and secret unhappiness.  Panamanian singer/actor Ruben Blades who was in ""The Cradle Will Rock"" and James Redford's (Robert's son) freshman directorial film ""Spin,"" does a nice job as the town local who has feelings for Maisie.  Soledad St. Hilaire was in ""Real Women Have Curves"" and does an outstanding job here as Josephina who discovers the miracle and embellishes it.  Father Russell has an assistant, Brother Amos, played by Scott Michael Thomas who was in ""Hart's War"" with Colin Farrell & Bruce Willis and also in ""Flight of the Phoenix.""  He does a nice job as the novice whose hopeful attitude is one that the town lacks.  My other favorite in this cast was Bill Sage who plays Lyle, married to the town beautician with a 10-year childless marriage.  Sage was in ""American Psycho"" and has a new sci-fi pic ""The Girl from Monday"" coming out this year.  He does an excellent job showing all the levels from blue collar beer-drinking sports enthusiast, negative down-in-the-mouth guy with an attitude, to loving prospective father as he and wife Stella have their own little miracle.  Although his will be an unheralded role, he delivers an excellent performance.  His wife Stella is played by Christina Cabot who had a small role in ""The Italian Job.""  Hayak says that the picture is about hope.  There is a lack of it in the town until the arrival of Jose.  Based on a Theodore Taylor novel, it is a sweet story that cheers the spirit and warms the heart.  Enjoy!",1110240000,15,2834,4.760245901639344
1985825,1,B0001AP0MW,"While the story kept my interest somewhat, I disliked the ""message.""

*SPOILERS*

If the blood on the crucifix actually turned out to be the boy's blood, the story would have been much better.  However, it turned out not to be, and therefore was supposed to be a miracle.  At this time, God doesn't work through such miracles, as far as I know, so this was a disappointing movie.

There was also swearing and some immodest clothing.",1106352000,3,432,4.631578947368421

8009528,2,B0001AP0MW,"We couldn't watch the whole thing. While I have no doubt that the acting was good (I really like Mare Winningham) and I'm constantly on the look out for ""family friendly"" movies, the long extended camera focus on the catholic crucifix in the first 15 minutes made us say, ""shall we find another movie to watch.""  So just consider this ""review"" to be a warning for non-catholic families who looking for something family friendly: If you're at all inclined to hold to a ""no graven image"" conviction, you might want to choose something else.",1442448000,,538,4.723404255319149

8009534,5,B0001AP0MW,"I seldom watch a movie more than once, but I don't know how many times I've seen this.  I even bought it.  I'm not a Catholic (the movie revolves around an event in the Catholic church in a small town), but you don't need to be to understand it.  The humanity of the characters and the simple yet deep wisdom communicated are seldom seen in a movie.  It cuts through the religious facade (something common to humanity, not just the Catholic Church) to the core of life.  Peter Fonda is the old despairing priest; Mare Winningham and Ruben Blades play the owners of the cafe and the bar, respectively.  Recognizable character actors are too numerous to mention, each with a solid, believable, and memorable part; others you may not have heard of are equally good.  This is Salma Hayek's first effort at directing.  If she never makes another movie, she has said enough in this one to validate her entire career.
  A word to church people: Leave your theology in the bathroom and just watch the movie.",1365465600,4,999,4.593220338983051
8009535,5,B0001AP0MW,"Maldonado Miracle, The

This is a lovely film that I looked for  for years, after seeing it on British TV. It gently takes a swipe at human understanding (or lack of), chiding us also for wanting to be self-important whilst losing sight of what is really important in life, but then reminds us that if we stop looking for somebody to come in and make a grand gesture of change in our lives, we can see the small miracles that already have power in our lives. There are some truly fine performances here, especially in the on screen relationship between Mare Winningham and Ruben Blades. Peter Fonda's work here is every bit as crafted and lean as his earlier work in ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things."" Eddy Martin is a gem of a find as the young Mexican boy at the centre of events. Salma Hayek, as a debuting director, is to be commended.",1350000000,,847,4.423076923076923
8009536,4,B0001AP0MW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's very uplifting and family-friendly. There are some very emotional parts and some very funny parts. I also felt that they portrayed the priest with great respect, and that his views were just the way a Catholic priest should think. While a comparative movie like ""Miracle of Marcelino"" is pretty cheesy (and a little strange), I felt that this movie was very well done.",1302825600,,406,4.898550724637682
