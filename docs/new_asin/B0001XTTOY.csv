biological weapons.  Naturally this has been denied by the government.",1302739200,,156,6.090909090909091
2042952,5,B0001XTTOY,"Just received the DVD-R of this movie...suprisingly clear transfer. If you are a fan of this movie, you will not be disappointed. Not HD quality of course, but great nonetheless",1297987200,,177,4.933333333333334
2042953,4,B0001XTTOY,"Have always remembered liking this movie back in the 80's. Looked for it on Dvd for the past few years but could never find anything but a few overpriced vhs. I finally found this month that Warner Bros Shop online is offering it on a made to order to DVD and have put it out as one of their Warner Bros.archive dvd version that they offer. I ordered it, received it today and am watching it.. They did a nice DVD package job on it and the disc. (it is made to order but looks like a store bought version) It is not remastered and they state that on the site but it is taken from a very good quality Tape transfer.. so it has the feel and look of a VHS tape but on DVD. sharpness is pretty good on it. Color is good for the time period. Has some slightly washed colors in certain scenes but overall quite pleased with it since you can not get a remastered dvd or blu-ray. Plus the story/movie still holds up pretty well as I remembered it.. So if you want a copy but in DVD form.. Check it out.",1285545600,,994,4.025252525252525
2042954,4,B0001XTTOY,"Loved this movie when I saw it back in the '80s.  It's very reminiscent of an ""X-Files"" episode, only it was released 10 years before that series began.  The WBshop online now has ""Endangered Species"" on DVD.  This version has not been remastered or restored, but it has to be better than what is out there now.  Maybe if sales are good enough the DVD will be made available through other online retailers in the future.",1276819200,,420,4.4868421052631575
2042955,5,B0001XTTOY,"I saw this in original release, and am now looking to see it in VHS or DVD.

I have a soft spot for better than average B flicks set in the sticks, and this one fits the bill.

I dig stuff like ""The Fog"", and the TV classic, ""The Gargoyles"", basically anything red state and alien.

I'm gonna order it in VHS, and hope it fits my memory.

I really wish they'd put this out in DVD,

but am scouring old VHS rubbish bins.

Black helcopters and mutilated beef cattle, who can ask for anything more?",1117411200,5,495,4.104166666666667
2042956,5,B0001XTTOY,"One of the truly great conspiracy theories/mysteries/thrillers of all time. Set in Colorado, the overall plot revolves around the true story of mysterious cattle mutilations in the American West. Are they performed by devil worshipers, space aliens, Soviet Spetznaz? Whatever you think, it's a depiction of a skillful, powerful, high tech entity that threatens to destroy the townspeople along with its ranching livelihood. Director Alan Rudolph does a superb job that is rivaled by the likes of John Carpenter and Michael Mann. Though known better for ""Vega$"" and ""SWAT"", Robert Urich proves his ability outside of TV. The version I have is a grainy copy recorded off of an RCA Selektavision Video Disc in 1983 (anyone out there rember those things?). It would be great if MGM would digitally restore this to DVD (as it has done with other great movies that I thought were too dated and obscure to restore). Any Art Bell fans in the house? Check out this movie in the new and used section. I promise you won't be disappointed.",1102723200,13,1027,4.908045977011494

2042962,3,B0001XTTOY,"Alan Rudolph is a director with an odd filmography full offbeat, eccentric films like ""Breakfast of Champions"". Influenced by New Hollywood names like Robert Altman, Rudolph has never seemed to conform to expectations and takes every opportunity to deliver on the contrary.

Rudolph crafted a few horror films in his early career (the most infamous being the VERY despicable ""Terror Circus""), though most of them were hardly seen. In an interview, Rudolph expressed near embarrassment at his early horror films, saying they were--to put it nicely--not very good.

""Endangered Species"" came later in his career and, along with a more polished film than his earlier attempts at suspense, is a pretty solid thriller. Robert Urich and JoBeth Williams are two small town folks that stumble upon a horrifying government secret that involves cattle mutilation, black ops and mass cover ups. The sense of paranoia is well crafted; the night sequences with the helicopter pursuit are some tense stuff! The acting reminds me of a Larry Cohen film: quirky, raw and with an edge to it that you wouldn't see in a mainstream Hollywood film in 1983.

The downside is that the film gets too long in the tooth and the sequences where Urich deals with his ludicrously mature daughter don't ring true. His daughter comes off lie she was written to be much older and her sense of logic is far beyond what most kids her age would be able to comprehend. The biggest problem is that the pace of the movie gets bogged down in the middle where we could've used a few more ""horror"" sequences to build tension.

Even with its flaws, this movie is worth watching once so you can see how it all unfolds... And a movie worth watching once has a leg up on most films out there.",1411171200,,1746,4.752475247524752
2042963,5,B0001XTTOY,"RARE , hard to find TV movie from the '80's with a great TV star cast . What was the mystery of cattle mutilations ? This film offers one version - and is likely to be the REAL reason ! (?) . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .",1410307200,,212,3.7333333333333334

2042965,3,B0001XTTOY,"I had seen this movie a long time ago, but I could not remember how it ended. So I rented this movie and remembered why I really didn't think it was all that good. So personally its ok..",1397260800,,186,3.9210526315789473
2042966,4,B0001XTTOY,"""Endangered Species"" is one of the best Warner Archive DVDs, and I think it demands repeated viewings. How sad that good thrillers such as this one are getting so hard to find, like virgins in the soiled seas. I love Robert Urich's performance, and Jo Beth Williams (fresh off the brilliant ""Poltergeist"") turns in a competent performance too--why didn't she continue on in the horror/sf/mystery film vein that she occupied during the early 80s? The script is taut, like a sailor's rope, the suspense is fine, and the pacing is deliberate. A keeper for sure, but I have little else to add about the DVD, other than the presentation is of good quality from what appears to have been a VHS tape transfer.",1389312000,,702,4.715447154471545
2042974,5,B0001XTTOY,"Do not even try to buy from i-Deals Store unless you like having your time wasted & receiving lousy customer service. I placed an order & 8 days later it had not even shipped. I contacted them twice to inquire as to the disc's availability, since they had accepted the order, & got not the courtesy of any response whatsoever. After I cancelled the order through Amazon, i-Deals Store then e-mailed with their apologies, etc, & stated that the item had never actually been in stock (so here's another seller who tries to sell you what they don't even have). A complete waste of time to have dealt with these people. They are one of those who maintain a high rating by paying disgruntled customers to remove negative feedback.

2042978,4,B0001XTTOY,"When I first saw this movie back when it first came out (or was that when it was first available on VHS) it was scary. Cattle mutilations were in the news and the topical lessons were scary. Many years later, this story still absorbs.",1377734400,,234,4.340909090909091
2042979,5,B0001XTTOY,Remembered seeing this movie so was glad to find it again in video. Covers a subject that was/is still big news out west. Gives us an answer of sorts all the while leaving us wanting to know more.,1374710400,,196,4.184210526315789
2042980,4,B0001XTTOY,"This film, done during the peak of the cattle mutilations cases in the United States points out --although following a screenplay-- a hypothesis about how and most important why those cattle mutilations occur.

Two elements call our attention, because they have documentary value. They both appear with red characters on the screen. The first, at the beginning of the film, is the the resolution of the US Congress: ""In 1969 the Congress banned any further testing of chemical and germ warfare.""
The second, at the end of the film: ""Since the 1969 Congressional ban on chemical and germ warfare testing, there have been an estimated 10,000 recorded cattle mutilations....""

We have to have in mind that the film is from 1982, which means that there was an average of 769 cattle mutilations per year during a period of 13 years.

Cattle mutilations afterwards have also been claimed in other countries.

While some people with fantasy prone mentality tend to ascribe this kind of events to UFO activity, this film has the virtue to offer a much more reasonably explanation, that probably has more to do with the reality of what is going on. I applaud MGM and the filmmakers!",1346889600,3,1173,4.8793969849246235
2042981,4,B0001XTTOY,"Robert Urich is a bit over the top with his character.
