2891061,5,B000SULWK4,"One of the problems with director Ismael Rodriguez's films is that they tend to be too stuffy and pretentious, but not this film. Los Tres Huastecos/The Three Huastecos(1948)is so funny, breezy and enjoyable. Triplet brothers(The Andrade Brothers, all played by Pedro Infante with the help of doubles and VFX shots) band together to bring El Coyote, a serial killer, to justice. The film also has some of the catchiest musical/dance numbers ever...all done in the Mexican idiom. Also, the make up and hair stylists do a superb job making the late Blanca Estela Pavon look so photogenic and pretty! One musical number was referenced in Ustedes Los Ricos. This film is recommended!",1232496000,9,679,5.071428571428571

8206970,5,B000SULWK4,"If I had to pick 2-3 best movies of Pedro Infante this one would very likely be there.
The creativity and talent is amazing specially since it was from 1940's. Pedro does a great job in his acting and like always the musical part of the movie is one of the best parts.

One way to understand a culture is through its movies, this movie is one of those that can give you a good look at life in the rural area.",1357257600,,408,3.975609756097561
8206971,5,B000SULWK4,"Que se puede decir, estas son peliculas clasicas de la epoca de oro del Cine Mexicano. Me traen tantisimos recuerdos de mi niez. La calidad de las peliculas es muy buena.  y los 3 huastecos se a convertido en un icono de grandesa cinematografica Mexicana.

8206972,5,B000SULWK4,"These wonderful movies are in the DNA of all Mexicans and most other Latin peoples.
As a Brit married to a Peruvian, I was aware but didn't really get into them until sustained viewings whilst on separate holidays in the Dominican Republic and Mexico. There are some great TV channels out there that are constantly showing ""golden age"" movies.
I can't really add anything to the knowledgeable reviews already published except to say that these are great movies in their own right and are certainly not imitations of the Hollywood of that age.
Pedro Infante was always terrific (and some singer too!).
This wonderful film has a place in the affections of all Latins and I believe that the actress who played the little girl is still warmly remembered today for that role and has icon status in Mexico.
The DVDs generally have very good extras though don't expect perfect English sub-titles!
Any movie buff should have some of these in their collection. Me, I'm going to collect the lot!",1331769600,2,985,4.8
8206973,5,B000SULWK4,"I love this movie!  It has action, romance, and a happy ending.  Pedro Infante does a fantastic job of playing all three roles.  Great family movie for the golden era.",1328486400,,167,4.5
8206974,5,B000SULWK4,"The plot and dialogs are very simple and predictable but because of this is very easy to follow and agile. Full of funny characters and situations. Suitable and enjoyable for all ages. It is also loaded with what is trully mexican: The clothes, the towns, the parties, etc. The viewer gets a good sense of what was life like in a small and peaceful mexican town in at the begining of the XX century. A good sample of what is called ""The Golden Age of Mexican Cinema"".",1311206400,,467,4.379310344827586
8206975,5,B000SULWK4,"Esta es una pelicula clasica. Generaciones y generaciones hemos disfrutado del abundante humor y exelente actuacion, en especial la de Pedro Infante quien hace tres personajes con personalidades muy diferentes. Es una pelicula muy recomendable.",1308268800,,244,6.0
