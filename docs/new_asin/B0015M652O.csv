For that reason, you will enjoy and understand the movie better if you see some Kitano movies or his comedy shows.

My list of Kitano movies to watch would be FIREWORKS, KIKUJIRO, ZATOICHI(Kitano version), and BLOOD AND BONES (Kitano's best acting performance; Wonderful film but sexual violence).

In addition, it is helpful to know that there is an excessive dramatic behavior of dropping to the ground as a way to depict ""unexpected somewhat disappointing surprise that prompts to delight the reader/viewer""  in Japanese comic books and animation.

In watching this film, forget all expectations about how a movie should be constructed.  If you are too attached to logical storyline you might wonder why things are how it is just like one of the character in the movie does only to find a simple answer.

The film is visually spectacular in unexpected way. Watch for ideas and vision unique to Kitano. It will challenge, bend and tickle your brain as there are a lot of informations to be absorbed throughout the piece.",1236902400,,1098,4.908108108108108
