6462373,5,B00L1WJESA,"If you've heard anything about Found already, you've probably heard it being called a ""coming-of-age"" horror film.  It certainly is coming of age because this story has one of the best takes on bullying that I have ever seen in a movie.  Right now as a nation, we are still trying to find positive ways to help our youth stand-up against bullies without resorting to violence.  Think of the problems that came with bullying and then think of a ""worst case scenario"" and that to me sums up Found.

Certainly, the subject matter may be a bit too much for some people to stomach and it might even hit a little close to home for some viewers.  Some of you may have heard tons of great things about this and might find it to be a bit over-hyped.  I can tell you the best way to watch Found is in the dark, alone with your thoughts.  This isn't your average horror movie.  I don't think it's one you should hand pick for all your buddies to watch together at a get together.  Save something b-grade that you can riff together for that ;) Sure, it's filled with lots of great practical fx but I feel the story was made to make you think.

Overall, this is a very well done film for those that are seeking something original and daring with it's approach.  If you're a fan of indie horror gems, add this one to your collection!",1404777600,29,1319,4.299595141700405
6462374,5,B00L1WJESA,"Absolutely Amazing!  Despite the gore in this movie, the viewer is introduced to a drama with likable characters.  What begins as a Dahlmeresque scenario snowballs into extreme cinema.  This indie film will fall into line with other great horror movies such as Audition, House of the Devil, Repulsion, Entrance etc.  This is a solid, professional horror movie.  We need more like this!",1404604800,34,385,5.145161290322581
6462385,5,B00L1WJESA,"Nine Things About the Movie ""found.""

1. This is a very low-budget, amateur film. Let me put that out there right away. If movies made with no money are an automatic deal-breaker, then you can stop reading now.

But his movie is an example of why I like ultra-indie horror. Because if you can get past the low budget and all the awkwardness comes with it, you can sometimes find something with the guts and bravery to show us things you won't see anywhere else. This is one of those movies.

2. The movie starts simply. A 12-year-old boy named Marty tell us, ""My brother keeps a human head in his closet.""

3. The movie is about a nice suburban family with a racist father who has anger problems. Mom tries to keep the peace. Marty is getting bullied at school, and Marty's older brother Steve is apparently a serial killer.

For some reason, when Marty discovers Steve's secret, he doesn't tell anybody. He keeps it to himself, and finds an outlet for his feelings by becoming obsessed with extreme horror films and drawing pictures of brutal murder.

4. At first, the movie appears to be some kind of morbid coming-of-age story, about a boy learning how to navigate a more adult world. But it's not. Instead of realizing that life gets better, Marty is thrust unprotected into some of the deepest horrors that the human condition presents. In tone and theme, it is very similar to another piece of expert indie horror, Frailty.

5. One of the strengths of the film is in the details. Video rental stores and the obscure horror movie posters hanging on the bedroom walls. It's also unsettlingly honest about the semi-sexual element behind a lot of middle-school bullying.

7. One of the things that intrigued me about the film was the stylized title. The movie isn't called Found, it's called found., with a lower-case f and a period after the word. It wasn't until the end of the movie that I figured out why it was written that way. And then it sent shivers through my body.

7. The camera work is thought out well, even if it doesn't always work the way it was intended. Most of the acting is not that great. The exception to that is Gavin Brown, the kid that plays Marty. He's better than all the other actors put together, except maybe for Ethan Philbeck, who does well as the older brother Steve. We need to keep an eye on those two guys.

8. What surprised me the most is the gore and sadistic violence in the film. Not only the amount of it, but how well-done it is. There are scenes that will make some people seriously upset.

9. If you like upsetting horror films, and you don't need it to have Hollywood polish, then I recommend this one. In a world of flashy but empty jump-scares, this is a hidden gem that needs to be found.",1464998400,2,2740,4.470941883767535
6462386,4,B00L1WJESA,"I have to give this title four stars instead of five due to issues with the closed captioning.  If you are hard of hearing or are in an environment where turning the sound up isn't an option then you need to skip this film.  While the contents are great when you can hear the dialogue....you won't have any clue as to what is happening if you can't.  The closed captioning has a good 15-20 seconds delay so most of the time you are at a completely different scene when the captioning appears.

6462389,5,B00L1WJESA,This film is very underrated in my opinion. I actually saw Headless first which is partially shown and referenced here. A young kid is picked on in school and struggles with that. His older brother meanwhile is a serial killer which he discovered by accident. Now he attempts to hide the fact that he knowns the truth about his brother and maintain control of his young life. His older brother does the right thing in trying to make him stand up for himself but of course discovers that his younger brother knows the truth. The films climax you won't forget. You'll enjoy this film. Pick up headless as well if you're a gore hound!,1456099200,2,631,4.543859649122807

6462405,5,B00L1WJESA,"This film holds no punches and also, gives no mercy. ""Found"" is an underground gem that is hard to find, only ""found"" when someone seeks it out. I was introduced to this film by a friend of mine, I was told of the story which I thought sounded interesting, he put it on and I must say I was sucked in immediately. This movie is what would happen if, ""Super 8"", ""Stand By Me"", ""A Serbian Film"" and ""Frontieres"" all had a baby. Sound weird? Well, that's the best way I can describe it.

The movie has a coming of age story about a boy named Marty who is obsessed with comics and horror film. Marty is a misfit, bullied in school, he is the weird kid who likes creepy things, he is picked on by students and raises concerns of teachers. Marty learns that his brother, Steve, is a serial killer, making his life a horror film. The movie is very dark, it gets darker as it gets to the end, it starts off as a coming of age story but then turns into a disgusting gorefest at the end. It's magnificent.

I want to point out how much I admire the effort of it's director, Scott Schirmer, who made this movie for only $8,000. It certainly is a noticeably shoe string budget movie, however, the story is so amazing and the acting is so good, it's easy to look past it. In all honesty, the movie looked great, the only ""Noticeable"" thing about how low the budget is was how sometimes the audio levels seemed uneven. However, it was forgivable. I was impressed at the amazing performances that Scott Schirmer got out of his actors and also the shots were great, locations and tones gave it the unsettling dark feeling. The music score especially is amazing, it's eerie and gives off the tone of the movie.

There really isn't anything bad I can say about ""Found"" as an aspiring filmmaker, I was floored, obsessed with this movie since I saw it. It proved you do not need a multi-million dollar budget to make an awesome movie. Scott Schirmer made a great piece for only $8k, imagine what he can do for $1 Million.",1447891200,7,2001,4.330666666666667

6462407,2,B00L1WJESA,"This is a morbidly low budget, amateur film.  It looks like home video.  Here's the break down, one boob shot, a couple of gore scenes and the rest is just boring, badly acted dialogue scenes.  The only reason I gave this film 2 stars is because of the actress who plays Marty's mom, Phyllis Munro, she's a hot MILF.  Here's something that I don't get.  Why does Marty bother putting gloves on when he's touching the corpse?  I mean he yanks the gloves off by the fingers contaminating his hands anyways and then he stuffs the glove down the back of his pants.  Why bother with the gloves at all??  There's a really odd racial component to this movie that honestly could have been left out.  It doesn't add anything to the film other then an awkward racist quality.  Watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do.",1445126400,2,815,4.445945945945946

actors involved with this trash. Kiddie porn is illegal. Subjecting a child actor to the level of sex
and gore in a movie like this should be too !",1433635200,,340,4.074626865671642
6462411,5,B00L1WJESA,"The story delves deep into the nuances of family dynamic like nothing I have ever seen before. Marty is a boy transitioning into his own only to have to deal with bullying, loss of familiarity and the complete and utterly disturbing degradation  of family stability. found. is so much more than a horror story, it is a visual ode to a very deep and personal problem lying unmentioned, ignored or unnoticed within our world of paved pathways that guide us along our daily destinations dotted by manicured lawns and cookie-cutter homes. That problem which Schirmer brutally forces us to notice is the complete and utter break down of family cohesion. That one aspect of life that for many of us is an assumed respite, a place of safety and comfort-home, viciously ripped away to expose a darkness that in this film is unequivocally the birth of evil.

The story plays with you completely from the very beginning. It grabs at your emotional center and squeezes slowly but firmly all the while pushing you to the very edge of tense anguish as felt through the eyes and mind of a child. found has done something that so few movies are capable of, it made me reevaluate how I define horror. The characters are so modest and honest that you relate to them in a truly gripping way. It exposes the twisted nature of misguided youth forced to face life with very few answers and nearly absent representation. Then simultaneously placing you head first into racism and bullying. But wait, as if that wasn't enough to make this well defined nightmare affective there is an added element that forces you as a viewer to test your limit of what is acceptable horror. It is a question that people have argued for quite some time- are horror films warping young people? This is truly the first time that I have seen that subject matter carefully and poignantly dealt with in the horror industry in such an honest manner.

In my opinion this is truly a masterful tale of terror that carries a deeper message that needs to be addressed, and manages to do so in a fresh and exciting way. It carries all the emotion of surrealistic art film, complete brutality and gore of a horror film in the most systematically harmonious ways imaginable. There is an element of truth that this story pulsates from that creates an atmosphere so haunting and tragic. The film is held together by a chilling soundtrack that allows the story with all its components to flow seamlessly. Quite frankly I hope more people than just the horror community experiences this film because although the visuals are graphic the heart of the drama is one that needs to be exposed because the true nightmare of this film is the fact that it could very well be happening in your neighborhood or more disturbingly in your very home. I recommend that everyone who comes across this film-watch it!",1433462400,,2842,4.6913827655310625

6462428,4,B00L1WJESA,"Truly startling and disturbing. A very dark natured film that showcases a perfect flowing tale of horror and story. This is a film that works for the viewer with a down to earth nature. It's a film that plays with the viewers mind. A film that showcases how to make a movie and express original talent, story and direction.

Gavin Brown who plays Marty the young star, the main star of the film has a wonderful natural talent and gives a wonderful narration voice over throughout the film that gives the viewer a sense of a novel coming to live action on film. The written voice over, captures high quality, imagination and thought provoking story which tends to leave the viewer awestruck.

The movie showcases secrets. A family full of secrets and Marty who knows them all. His big brother tends to have a new decapitated head in his closet every couple days and Marty explores and wants to understand his brothers secret.

Found is what Hollywood needs, a true original idea that is perfect in great details and social issues and an underlining hypocritical reality that people are not what they seem. Scott Schirmer directed a low budget indie horror that gives so much to the viewer and the overall reality of film making in general. Schirmer gives the viewer the youth, the horror, the adventures and coming of age of youth all tied into one. The direction flows with a smooth ordeal that seems to feel like it's unfolding right before your eyes in real time; that is how good the direction is.

Gavin Brown I cannot speak enough about. This young talent is amazing. He is able to capture the youth and the imagination and exploration in trying to cope with his surroundings. The horror is believable, the idea of violence and murder sleeping in the next room and the fear that maybe your next makes the viewer on edge.

6462466,2,B00L1WJESA,"A great premise somewhat marred by wildly inconsistent acting and some fatal flaws at the script level - one example being the disappearance of the main character's schoolmate which goes unmentioned script-wise. It is never touched upon in a TV news segment, a conversation between the parents, a visit by the police, a moment at school or otherwise...something that would just not occur in suburban 21st century america. You could incorporate just two lines of dialogue in the film to address it, but they never do. The main actor (a young kid) gets better as he goes along, but simply does not have the experience or acting chops to convey the complexity of emotion that the scripts ambitions have. There is at least one draw dropping thing (a nudity shot) included towards the climax of the movie that perhaps should have been saved for when this new director has a better grasp on his material.  It's almost so outrageous and unexpected that it changes the movie from horror to camp in a blink of an eye. You'll know it when you see it! Kudos to Ethan Philbeck who plays the older brother, though. He is the actor who gives the movie 110%. It's almost unfair that he is surrounded by so much amateurism that seems tied to the constraints of the budget. I'm not disappointed I watched it.

A Lifetime movie would have been better than this film. I expected a more seemingly interesting storyline than was depicted. More so a story of bullying. Typical serial killer run of the mill story other than that. Nothing new there. The acting and writing horrible as well.

Then when I was going to turn it off it get a little better so I just left it on, the acting was horrible and the special effects were very lame!

6462516,1,B00L1WJESA,"I was so excited to see this movie when I purchased it because of all the great reviews it received,and the fact that I had never heard of it until it appeared under my amazon recommendations section. Well trust me when I tell you that out of all the movies I purchased that day, this was the absolute worst. The first thing I noticed was that it was extremely low budget with tons of horrible acting. I couldn't believe that I was watching the same movie that others had praised so much. It looked to me like someone shot this film with a personal camcorder for a class project. It's the type of movie that you would expect to find in the horror section of redbox. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar to see this, and the ending is the only part that justifies spending that much. Although I can respect honest reviews even if they are the polar opposite of my own, I would advise you not to be fooled by professional reviewers who are just trying to sell a product. You can tell most of those reviewers because they all have titles like (five stars!) followed by a one line review such as (wonderful) or (great) with no explanation as to why. I would tell anyone to take my advice and skip this movie, or to do yourself a favor and wait for it to come out on redbox.",1413676800,5,1266,4.235537190082645
6462517,4,B00L1WJESA,"This film's story will definately be etched in your mind after the credits. Social commentary mixed with horror: bullying and the deadly results from playing 'blind fool'. Even after all the school shootings and self-destruction, some adults still want to play blind fool or 'look the other way' which makes me as livid as the bullies themselves!
The gory violence will satisfy horror fans, but it's not for the squeamish...trust me on this! The script is an exaggeratted reality but not by too much and the horror isn't just regarding the violence, the whole story is disturbing enough in relation to today's culture.

Yes. Ok than, this film is about a kids coming of age story as he uncovers his brother is a killer. It actually had a solid story, incredible acting, and a plot that leads to a climatic ending. This is not a film you can play at home and look down at your phone through the boring parts texting because there are none. This film grabs you from the very beginning with a 'WTF' intro and keeps you at the edge of your seat till the very end. It has dark humor, drama, and truly terrifying scenes beyond what you have seen in other films. It is original and shocking. It gets under your skin in ways that many films can't touch and it surpasses every paranormal or found footage POV movie ever. It is that good and it goes THERE. This film is a BUY but don't watch it late at night or you will not be able to sleep. It is truly mind bending and the lead younger actor deserves major kudos for pulling off this terrifying role. I can't say anything else without giving away spoilers. Must watch!",1413417600,2,1038,4.274111675126903

I'm not even going to complain about the acting, though it wasn't great, it was good enough for this type of movie. The only horror part in the movie is the last 20 minutes, and the only thing good about it was the idea of it. It wasn't very entertaining. One ""professional"" review said something like ""So many decapitations!"" You don't see a single decapitation in the entire movie, all you see is some fake heads.

The best thing I can say about the movie is that the film's poster is artful. Only one actor's skill was above average. The movie circled the drain until I found myself in an unimpressive sewer of poor cinema - bad writing, acting and directing. Elements were thrown in from time to time, perhaps an attempt at cohesion. Doing so was like throwing eggs at a landfill. If Found is later rated, it should definitely be NC-17. But horror buffs be not fooled, it's not worth it.",1412035200,,607,4.577981651376147

6462529,1,B00L1WJESA,"It seems Amazon.com deleted the review I created for Found probably because I gave away the plot of the movie. Ok, in a nutshell the oldest son in this family basically loses his mind and starts beheading women. It seems he became twisted after he watched a movie called ""Headless"". In the movie the killer beheads women and then has coitus with the human head. Meanwhile the little brother rummages through his older serial killer brother's room when he is gone. He's just your typical snoopy kid. He goes through family members private stuff when they are not home. So the younger brother finds one of the heads in a bowling ball bag and he becomes aware of the fact that his brother has become a killer. I know this movie won awards but I also know the ISIS Muslims and their fans are beheading people left and right these days. And Muslims all over the Middle East are doing this also. Drug cartels in Mexico are also known to behead innocent people. This movie glorifies a ghastly form of murder. And this movie champions this sort of murder as an act of revenge to bullying. Also, the serial killer son calls blacks ""degenerates"" and that is why he singled them out for death. So keep glorifying this sort of cinematic sickness and I'll keep on telling you not to bother. Some of you think I am missing the point, that this is horror. Yes, I know it is horror but it is also sickening like I Spit On Your Grave and The Last House on the Left. If you like these kind of movies then maybe you could get some real killers to start actually filming the people they kill and torture in real life. There seems to be a real disconnect between horror fans and reality and this is what happened to the killer in the movie. The two boys loved to watch horror and the older brother lost his mind and started acting out what he had seen in a movie. And this happens to real people. Just try to remember Jeffery Dahmer, John Wayne Gaycey, Ted Bundy. Some sick people just need something like the genre of horror to desensitize them to how horrible this really is. Movies like this just compel sick minds in this direction. Humans do little more than to imitate other humans.

Anyway, enjoy the sick garbage. I destroyed my copy of the movie. I just wish some of you had a near death experience with a real serial killer and then this sort of movie would take on an entirely new meaning.",1411862400,3,2379,4.394557823129252
6462530,3,B00L1WJESA,"OK, I've been a true, or rather, a ""genuine"" horror fan for fifty years, and I have a very strong feeling that the people who rated this flick four or five stars must have been paid to do so. Accept for the young actors who play the kid and the killer in this quite disturbing movie, none of the other actors in the film can actually ""act."" The producers must have hired their family members and friends. The choreography for the fight scenes is totally lousy--the fakest I've seen in awhile. My friends and I threw more realistic punches in the neighborhood plays we put on when we were kids. To me, the biggest assets of the movie are the two young men who played the brothers--they totally save it from ending up as just another really low-budget horror movie. I admit the story line is quite intriguing and kept me wondering where the makers of the movie were actually going with it.  Blood and gore is taken to a new level I'd say, and I have to caution everyone--there is very, explicit male nudity as well as demented, sadistic sex scenes.  Even with the poor acting and fake fight scenes there's no mistaking that this is a ""Horror"" movie, and  I won't be forgetting it for a long, long time. I really hope the movie doesn't ""inspire"" anybody.
SPOILER ALERT: I previously neglected to mention the main issue I had with this movie because I didn't want to give too much away. However, after further contemplation I feel compelled to add this SPOILER ALERT. In this movie, the ""N"" word is quite hatefully used twice. The first time is bad enough, but the second time is in an extremely crude, indecent manner. I was so shocked by it, that even though the movie was approaching its climax, my overwhelming anticipation to see what the killer was going to do next was momentarily blacked-out and superseded by an immense curiosity leading me to question the writers' intentions. They could have used any one of a million reasons for the revengeful slaughters. The little kid's narration, the dysfunctional family, the blood, guts and perverted gore could have all been an excellent crescendo perhaps resulting in ""The horror movie that changed the world!"" If they had just changed one part of the script to read, "" ..I just can't stand bullies."" Oh well.",1411776000,4,2258,4.6259351620947635

No, is it super gory? Fairly (I have seen worse), is it different then anything out there? Most definitely.
A great serial killer story told by the perspective of a family member. I don't want to say too much about this film, because it is one you should see for yourself, however if you can get past the fact that this isn't a big Hollywood production, you will see much like I did the true brilliance of this film; characters that deal with real problems, that have genuine reactions, a plot that isn't very predictable, and for an indie film some of the best gore sequences that could even pass for the real deal. The extras on the DVD are great, you get to see the uncut versions of the horror films within the film, granted they are short, but for something that is a background piece in the movie it sure is fun to watch.

6462554,5,B00L1WJESA,"Sitting down to write my review of this unique film, I have so many mixed emotions, don't know
weather to give it one star or 5!

Marty is a twelve year old boy who has a morbid fascination with all things horror.

He draws graphically violent story board like pictures; his room is decorated with horror film things.

But, he is in a very strange and awkward situation, his older brother Steve is a serial killer.

The films exposition is mostly through the perspective of Marty, as he narrates his story in the first person. So we know right away that nothing really bad is going to happen to him.

In the beginning of the film, Marty takes his Moms rubber gloves, and sneaks into his brothers room to have another look at the severed head stuffed in a bowling ball bag, in the closet.
As Marty narrates, he is consumed with childlike fascination. He carefully removes the bag from the closet, unzips it, and inspects its contents.
He is concerned about making sure his brother doesnt suspect that the bag has been moved.
He is more concerned about placing the bag back in the closet exactly as he found it, while wearing his Moms gloves then he is about the fact that a person has been murdered.
I hope I don't end up like this he says in his narration.
People freak out when they see a fake rubber head prop, but he gets to see the real thing.
He knows his brother murdered this person, but he is too young to understand the consequences of violence, the emotions of love and passion. He has a childs apathy.

When a school bullys head ends up in the bowling ball bag later in the film, and Marty shows it to his sleepover friend, a deep secret has been broken. Steve discovers his brother knows, and the film spirals into ever increasing madness.

The film lacks the polish of a high budget production, but this actually gives the film a more real feel.
In this film, the graphic violence is not gratuitous, it makes sense, and the family conflicts and emotions work on many levels, social and psychological, and the story pulls you in.
I was wondering, what in the world is going to happen next right up until the truly bizarre ending, when I saw something I have never seen before in any American film (outside of porn) and had to do a double-take to find out if what I thought I saw, was really what I saw!
If you haven't seen the film, you will know what Im talking about when you see it.

I have never seen a film quite like this, Martys story, told in his own words, resonates a disturbing reality, an invisible reality, that no one wants to think about too deeply, because they may find something that hits too close to home.",1411516800,2,2637,4.389344262295082
6462555,5,B00L1WJESA,"I just finished one of the best movies Ive seen in 2014 thus far.  FOUND has won several awards at film festivals across the country, and I can understand why.  This brutal horror flick has some excellent gore, plenty of tension, and an ending that will haunt you long after the credits roll!

When I first heard about FOUND, a lot of hype was circling the film.  The fact that it had won so many awards was enough to make me take interest, but that can also be a bad thing; historically, films that win major awards are too artsy for me.  Thankfully, this film lives up to its hype and exceeds it.  This movie is a definite must-have for horror fans.

FOUND is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  Granted, it is a lower budget film, but you can barely tell.  The production team did a great job with the money they had, and they didn't skimp where it counted.

The acting is really good, and Im very impressed with the lead cast.  Gavin Brown portrays the main character, Marty, and he does a stellar job.  IMDB lists this role as his first, but I would have guessed he was a veteran actor.  Likewise, Ethan Philbeck does an excellent job as the older brother, Steve.  Both show versatility and range as actors, and I would wager they should look forward to long careers in Hollywood.

The special effects are eye-poppingly realistic, and I love them.  Theres plenty of carnage to go around in this flick, and it is very well done.  Theres no CG here as far as I can tell.  The blood spurts and the entrails shimmer.  You cant ask for much more.  I have to give a nod to the special effects team for their work because this film wouldnt have been nearly as good without it.

FOUND is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend every horror fan check it out as soon as possible.  With an epic storyline and some high caliber effects, this is a movie that people will be talking about for a long time.  The disc touts some cool special features, too, including two full-version movies that are shown within the film itself.  The film hits shelves next week, so make a note.",1410912000,2,2092,4.360103626943006

6462557,4,B00L1WJESA,"FOUND is the latest award-winning horror feature from director, Scott Schirmer. Winning Best Feature at Elviras Horror Hunt, this grisly film revolves around a young boy named Marty and his obsession for horror movies. Marty is bullied at school and his home life is a mess, but luckily for him, his passion for terror on the silver screen helps keep him grounded. As a secret is revealed about a family member, Marty must decide if he should put his family first or stand up for what is right.

With FOUND, Schirmer creates a unique film that hits on all cylinders. High levels of production value and acting are paired up nicely with the well thought out story. Marty is a great character that lets the true horror fans in the audience reminisce about the days of being a kid in love with movies. Gavin Brown, who plays Marty, is a great young actor with a bright future. His lines are delivered to perfection as none feel rushed or amateurish in any way. The big brother in the film, Steve, is played by Ethan Philbeck. As a stage actor, Philbeck takes to the screen with an amazing transformation into his character. Winning Best Actor at Elviras Horror Hunt at Hourrorhound in Indianapolis for his role, Philbeck hold nothing back. He gives by far and away one of the best performances Ive ever seen in an independent horror film. His performance must be seen to be believed.

The blood, gore and downright disturbing imagery found with this indie flick can rival any film as of late. The ending will make your skin crawl and if you have a weak stomach, you may need to look away. Although I couldn't take our eyes off the screen!",1409184000,,1635,4.57679180887372
6462558,4,B00L1WJESA,"Let me start by saying that the acting was pretty bad. HOWEVER, this didn't take away from the movie itself. It had a very old school ""VHS"" movie feel to it. From what I gather, this is what the filmmakers were going for? The sound and overall quality of the picture pretty much mimicked an old VHS tape you'd get from the rental store back in the day. That being said....this is a WEIRD movie! Not in a bad way. There are scenes in this movie that will make even the most hardcore horror fans cringe. My only real complaint with the movie was that I felt there were far too many loose ends. Too many questions remained, but then again, that might just be from my own thinking. Gavin Brown (the kid who played Marty) had the perfect facial expressions throughout the film. He also had the best response in history to the question ""Do you have something to say to him too?"". Overall I felt the movie did a good job of making me feel like I'd gone back in time and rented a video from my local store (always HATED Blockbuster, but that's besides the point).

Final Verdict: Watch it!",1408752000,,1081,4.325123152709359
6462559,5,B00L1WJESA,"Where to even begin with this movie?
""Found"" is a highly uniquely entertaining film that is often racially offensive and homophobic but it all plays a part in the plot. It has a lot of retro horror movie references and posters of movies like Without Warning, Popcorn and some others. It also shows a VHS collection with movies like Screamers and Uncle Sam to name a couple. Other horror films are mentioned as well. It all plays into the storyline which asks the frequently speculated question ""can horror films make you comment murder""?

The film centers on a family with a young son and his older brother who just happens to be a serial killer. The younger boy stumbles upon a bowling ball bag with a severed head in it and from there on gets more and more bold in his attempt to figure out what his older brother is up to.

Most of the gore which is quite over the top comes from a movie within this movie called ""Headless"" which the serial killer steals from a video store. Not to say there isn't gore in the film itself,there is. It is quite graphic in the depiction of a particular disgusting sexual act by the killer as well.

I found this film to be clever,shocking and different, something I would  certainly watch again.the acting was good enough especially by Ethan Philbeck who plays Steve the older brother /Serial Killer.",1408233600,20,1335,4.55

6462561,4,B00L1WJESA,"Marty, 12 years old is a young Horror obsessed pre-teen. He also knows about his older brother Steve's darkest secret: That Steve is a serial killer. Bullied at school and by his own father, perhaps Marty has found even more than a protector in his brother? The only problem is what might happen to him if Steve discovers what his younger bro knows.

FOUND isn't too far from perfection in the horror genre in my opinion. And it achieves this without even abusing the massacre and gore scenes. Don't panic gore hounds. This film will eventually deliver the goods. But what i liked the most about it is that i was glued to the screen from start to finish despite the slow burn style of FOUND. And it managed to scare me and disturb me even with so little. Because the film is a rare realistic portrait of a family, the most ordinary and average family at first sight, entangled in nothing but everyday problems. Some things that we as a society tend to ignore and/or shovel down deep inside and under the rugs.

If there are things that i've always found hard to stand both in real life and in movies are things like violence on Women, kids, animals, racism and of course the ever present and growing problem that is bullying. That bullying happens in school or at home in the confort of what should be a safe place, it has become a matter with such amplitude that teachers will ignore the bullied like there was nothing that can possibly be done to end a feud between 2 kids. That until a bullied kid finally replies to a bully, which often results into having a nice kid grounded, and sometimes worst: Beaten in return and/or perceived as a young waste of flesh by our society's great thinkers.

Briefly, bullying is such a nightmare and FOUND reflects that reality in such a scary way. This rarety in the Horror genre is to be witnessed at your own risks. This is not a subject matter that you bring to the table at dinner. And there is such a violence involved in this film that even the scenes where it is left to the viewer's imagination might enrage or disgust and disturb someone.",1407974400,2,2087,4.458115183246074

8663330,4,B00L1WJESA,"Once seen, FOUND will not soon be forgotten, for it is a horror movie that pulls no punches, and takes its premise all the way. Made for only eight thousand dollars, it delivers the kind of kick to the gut those high concept, CGI laden reboots, and remakes, populating the multiplexes wish they could give an audience. In every way, this movie is the antidote to the mediocrity of PG-13; in truth, if this film, which is unrated, were to be given a rating by the MPAA, it would surely be NC-17.  There is extreme gore of the very explicit 21st Century variety, but for me, the scenes of emotional horror and trauma were far worse; this movie goes to the heart of darkness, and then keeps on going.

We know what we are in for in the first scene, where Marty, a shy and bullied 5th Grader, finds a severed human head in a bag inside of his older brother Steves bedroom closet. Turns out his big bro is a serial killer, a fact to which Martys typically suburban parents are totally oblivious. Marty decides to keep this awful secret, for he loves his brother, the only member of the family with whom he can relate, but this proves to be a fateful mistake, as Marty, a kid who finds escape in horror movies, finds that his life is rapidly becoming one. Marty is no wisecracking tween from a Spielberg picture, but an emotionally immature and painfully withdrawn kid, very much like the ones you would find in any classroom in the real world. That is one of the reasons why this movie is so tough to take.

Serial killers have become a pop culture trope in the past few decades, and in many TV shows and movies they have morphed into a variant of the super villain, like the character of James Patrick March in AMERICAN HORROR STORY: HOTEL. But Steve is no Dexter, he is a nuclear bomb, and when he finally detonates, and his true nature is revealed, he will vaporize all those close to him and leave a wasteland of collateral damage for the survivors. There is torture, sadism, cannibalism, necrophilia, and full frontal, but the scenes of Marty being bullied have a special power to make the viewer squirm, as FOUND conveys the ugly truth that bullies, even when they are called out, never receive proper punishment; are never adequately paid back in equal measure for the pain they have dealt out. I found myself totally on Martys side when he turns on one of his tormentors and puts a brutal beat down on him, then stands his ground when chastised by adults.

Reportedly, FOUND was made for only $8,000 in Indiana, if so, then it is amazing what they did so much with so little. All credit to director Scott Schirmer and screenwriter, Todd Rigney, for putting big time Hollywood to shame. Some of the acting is not up to standard, but Gavin Brown as Marty, and Ethan Philbeck as Steve are spot on. And special thanks to S.A. Bradley at the Hell Bent for Horror podcast for steering me to this exceptional film. After watching it on Blu Ray, what I was feeling must have been akin to what the first audiences to see NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD felt when they walked out of the theater back in 1968.",1501545600,,3094,4.441901408450704

There is gore, but only to try and shock the viewers in a few scenes. The special effects however, are not all that and not enough for fans of gory horror films to be making such a big deal over.

8663332,2,B00L1WJESA,There's potential here and some pretty sick scenes. But the cast acting on the part of all but the 2 brothers is pretty distracting. If you're into loads of gore and shock value tactics this movie may be for you.,1480377600,,212,4.325
8663333,5,B00L1WJESA,It lives up to all the reviews in the trailer. Not action packed but more of a psychological Intensity to it.,1472947200,,109,4.238095238095238
8663334,2,B00L1WJESA,"Rented the film: way too many holes in the plot to justify recommending it: Kudos to Gavin Brown for an excellent job of acting in spite  of the awfulness of the plot. 1:  I hate it when screen writers have to have a good kid getting bullied; I work with young people and there are always reasons certain kids get bullied: ugly looks, ugly clothes, bad breath, smells bad, acts weird, girlish, mouthy, etc. Normal kids with good grades usually hang around other kids who are like them and rarely if ever get bullied. 2: Small town setting with multiple disappearances yet not one word in the movie if authorities are investigating these disappearances. A fifth grader disappears yet still not one word from the authorities on it. 3. The elder son becomes a serial killer and are we to believe it is because of the movies he watches and his dislike for certain minorities? 4. The parents are totally inept in the fact that they have not a clue as to what is going on in the bedroom right beside them? 5 The elder son brings home the severed heads of his victims, keeps them in a bowling bag in his closet, has no lock on his bedroom door and yet is not afraid of getting caught by the parents? I can list at least a dozen more holes in the plots but it would be useless. Just a poorly scripted movie.",1470700800,,1299,4.341563786008231
8663335,4,B00L1WJESA,"Extremely well done low budget flick.  It reminds me of a Lifetime for Women movie involving a serial killer son.  The film is through the eyes of a 12 year boy who struggles with bullying, growing up and coming to terms with his serial killer brother.  The acting was very good.  The story was slow at moments.  If you are looking for graphic gore, you won't be disappointed.  The music scored for the film was simple, but it worked very well.  The film is really character driven and less about the gore until later in the film.",1469923200,,530,4.402061855670103
8663336,5,B00L1WJESA,"I watched this a couple years ago on Amazon Video, during rental period I probably watched it 3 times. I've been thinking for a while that it was time to rent it again. When I ""found"" out what a great price I would get to buy it that was the way to go. I so love this movie! Most movies are a one watch gig for me so I don't buy dvd's often. This is one I will watch probably a few times a year. I also plan to rent the movie ""headless"" that was inspired by this awesome indie film buy I am saving that as a special reward when I get a few important chores done. I have seen a LOT of horror movies and this is one that sticks with you, I love that feeling coz it don't happen often!",1465257600,2,682,3.7762237762237763
