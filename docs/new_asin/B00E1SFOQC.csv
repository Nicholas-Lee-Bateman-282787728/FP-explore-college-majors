As I started to investigate the basics and learned quickly there are many things that can harm people if you aren't doing it right.

We ordered Kelly's DVD and since we only live about 15 mins away we setup a private session with her to learn more. Kelly sent her on her way inspired and excited with a few cones of henna the attached pics are of her first work on her own hand (she's a lefty like Dad) :)

I have a feeling my wife and I are going to have henna designs on us for many weeks to come lol, but seriously the DVD is full of great tips and information not to mention a nice history of the styles and origins, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning the art of Henna.

I attached a few pics of my daughters first work on herself after meeting with Kelly, it's her first work but I think it looks darn good and we were grateful for Kelly's DVD and private session.",1500768000,,1045,4.137931034482759
