The story begins with a steam train rolling through the desert at night. Men climb on box cars to reach a car with valuable goods. They open the door and throw out bales of raw silk, worth a lot of money. A watchman investigates, and is shot. The police are asked to watch for trucks in that area. One truck goes a little too fast around a curve and crashes. Can they stop another truck? The police chase this hijacked truck. Will Stony, Tucson, and Lullaby get the blame for the theft and murder? But the Three Mesquiteers turn the situation around and escape from the lawmen. Can they catch the real crooks and clear their names? There is drama and action at Mike's Garage. Two motorcycle cops chase them into the country. Outside of town they find a traveling medicine show; they join it. But they find a boom town that has gone bust.

Is there a surprise in town? Is that old geezer crazy like a fox? Can Lullaby and Tucson get supplies from the next town without being recognized? The sheriff chases them, but they escape. [Note how they fill the gas tank on that truck.] The boy follows his dog into that store, and hears too much. The Mesquiteers can't even call their lawyer! But they see the trucks and follow them. One truck is captured, the boy is freed. The other truck is chased. Lullaby captures the gang. There should be a happy ending with the capture of these dangerous criminals.

This is another barely average movie that has an interesting beginning but an implausible ending.",1287360000,,1529,4.532608695652174

Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of source material stock (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezeweed.
