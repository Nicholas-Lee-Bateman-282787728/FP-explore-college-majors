Presented the movie to her in a special ""English basket"" with all goodies from ""home"" including ""Are you being Served"" movies and british bisquits and candies.  Christmas was very special with the viewing of this movie, had many great laughs.",1168300800,,312,4.7592592592592595
904103,5,6304646127,"This set is great to give to someone for Christmas that doesn't own the entire set on DVD. The scene where the mannequin's robe comes open and flashes Mr. Humphries is a classic.  It always has me rolling on the floor.  This DVD is great to help you get in the Christmas mood.  I love watching the BBC Christmas comedies.  I pull them out at Thanksgiving every year.  GREAT to decorate the tree by.  Another great Christmas DVD is the ""Keeping Up Appearances Deck the Halls with Hyacinth.""  It also makes a great gift!",1157328000,18,518,4.446808510638298
904104,1,6304646127,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Are You Being Served?  I have most of the episodes memorized but this is a total rip off.  The episodes shown here are available with the regular series DVDs and the quality is very poor.  The ""On Set Interview"" lasts about 4 minutes and involves some reporter asking cast members if they like being on the show. DUH!  Get the series, the movie and the sequel but forget this thing.",1129680000,37,409,4.342105263157895

Let's set the department store aglow in holiday designs. Let's watch Mr. Grace treat the staff to a Christmas lunch filled with fun and havoc....boy was that a luncheon we won't forget.  Just like the set of 7 volumes, this Christmas edition will not disappoint. I love English comedies! And so will you as it will hook you into watching and loving the holidays even more. Well worth it....highly recommended.",1000425600,9,573,4.907216494845361
904108,5,6304646127,"Ever since I first discovered this great series, I have wanted to see the Christmas shows. My local PBS never aired them and until I found this collection I was out of luck. I'm glad I found them! The shows are great, they are all must sees. I really wish that instead of 'Top Hat and Tails' they would have put on another Christmas special, 'the Punch and Judy Affair.' 'Top Hat and Tails' is technically not a Christmas special. 'Christmas Crackers' is my favorite on the tape, but 'Father Christmas Affair' is still excellent. The musical at the end of 'Christmas Crackers' is funny in standard AYBS style, but also quaint and nostalgic. Overall, this is a fine holiday collection from Britain's funniest!",946857600,7,708,4.717741935483871
904109,5,6304646127,"My two PBS stations in my rural area show AYBS?, but for some reson they never show any of the christmas episodes.

These four Christmas shows are a wonderful introduction to watching the entire series with the cast camping it up in wild storybook characters and hoofing it up in dance routines... and then there are those crazy mechanical store displays that go haywire and the awful cafeteria food!

Keeping in mind however, that British humour is somewhat different than that of the USA in as much as they take more risks with gestures and language. But also to note, there is no vulgarity of any kind that I could see and if there was, it would be in the Are you being served tradition...",1231200000,,551,4.425742574257426

7875180,5,6304646127,"This is a set of four ""Christmas Specials"" from the series. So if you own the entire set, you'll already have these episodes. In England, they often have Christmas specials for tv series, but they needn't necessarily be about Christmas. The first of these, ""Christmas Crackers"", is from 1975 and has the staff wearing fancy costumes for Christmas, following a harrowing Grace Brothers holiday canteen dinner. Next is ""The Father Christmas Affair"" when Mr. Grainger accidently stains his face dark brown. ""Happy Returns"" is a Mr. Grace birthday episode, as the staff have to learn a pantomime review. Finally, the ""Punch and Judy Affair"" is an extended episode where the staff put on a childrens' puppet show. So there you have it. If you own the complete series, you'll already have these. As a stand alone product, they are still enjoyable and feature the cast in some unusual costumes. Trevor Bannister features in all the specials, but Mr. Grainger is only in the first two.",1456358400,,977,4.927272727272728

Of course, Mr. Humphreys is my favorite but Mrs. Slocum makes me less sad to be approaching my seventies.  Her hair is awesome, as in the past I have had many colors, but she has me beat with her green and pink hair.  The episodes such as Christmas Crackers and The Father Christmas Affair are delightful but the piece'de resistance, The Punch and Judy Affair, is the best.  So funny and seemed like a lot of the script seemed to be ad-libbed  by the terrific actors, most of which have been on the show since the beginning.  Been a fan for years and loved watching it.  I wish I had a job in my past in a department store that had so much joy, and camaraderie that they seem to have since all get along, with some little arguments, that are cured by the show's end.
