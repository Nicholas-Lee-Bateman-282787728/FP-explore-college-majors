7800375,1,1612387306,"All you'll ever see is the inside of  cathedrals.  Rick Steve appears to be enjoying it, but if you were expecting to see cities, restaurants, rivers, castles, forts, and beautiful scenery, forget it.  If you're the kind of person who likes to listen to art history professors discuss religious artifacts, this is for you!",1495584000,,322,4.925925925925926

7800380,5,1612387306,All the programs on this disc were in Blu-ray format so I wasn't disappointed in this one.  Rick Steves is a delightful host and I like that he features places that most tourists can afford to visit.,1428710400,,199,4.378378378378378

7800383,4,1612387306,"It turns out that I am not Rick Steves, or a version of Rick Steves, meaning I interact with the world and people differently than he does- he's more outgoing, more interested in eating pub food, probably drinks a little more, and has different tastes in tourist experiences. I didn't appreciate that before I read the book and spent two weeks in Spain, and now feel like I know him, at least the public version of him, much more than previously. I'll probably read the next tourist book by him differently.

That said, the book was great. The hotel recommendations in particular were spot-on, and the rest of the information was current and accurate. If we did the trip over again, we'd do it differently, but I'd still buy this book to plan it.",1411862400,,746,4.567164179104478
7800384,3,1612387306,"This is a good travel DVD for budget minded travelers, lacking in reviewing better class hotels and bed & breakfast places. Disappointed in the  Berlin section. There's so much more to explore in Berlin, instead Steven spends DVD time discussing subjects with an ultra liberal Berlin family....(who cares??),  a missed opportunity to show more of this amazing city, after all this is supposed to be a travel DVD informing buyers of worthwhile places to visit.",1400457600,3,459,5.1066666666666665
