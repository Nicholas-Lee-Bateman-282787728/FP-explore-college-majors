8148164,1,B000IZJQPW,"A horrible steaming steamer. If you think you're going to see Ed Parker demonstrating Kenpo Karate, you aren't. Fight scenes are all Hollywood fighting with no real technique. A waste of Parker's talent. Want to see Kenpo? Stick with Perfect Weapon.",1441497600,,249,5.097560975609756

8148166,2,B000IZJQPW,"Kill the Golden Goose, or Kill the Golden Ninja, as the movie is titled on the screen, is one of those low budget efforts recruited well known martial artists to star in quickie productions, hoping to find the next Bruce Lee. This time out Korean Hapkido master, Bong Soo Han, is cast as a police detective, and Ed Parker, most notably famous for his Kempo style of karate and being Elvis Presley's primary karate instructor. Han was perhaps best known for doing all the leg work in the Billy Jack movies. (Ever wonder why Tom Laughlin wore that crazy hat during his fight with the gang of bullies in the park? It was Han doing all the high kicks.) Parker plays an assassin from Hawaii and body builder, Ken Waller, plays one of the minor villains who gets in Parker's way. The acting is pretty bad and the production looks like it was filmed on a shoe string budget. Han's command of English is not that good, either, and you have to wonder if he was reading his lines off a phonetic cue card. Parker looks to be clad in a bushy wig and he wasn't in very good shape for the movie. The plot is practically non-existent and leads up to the big confrontation between Han, the hero, and Parker, the villain, at the climax. I bought the DVD because I heard what a great fight scene it was, but in terms of movie fights it's not that impressive. If you're a fan of the old. cheaply done martial arts movies like Force Five and Jaguar Lives, this one is about the same quality..",1415059200,7,1472,4.356363636363636
8148167,4,B000IZJQPW,"These are the Martial Arts Heroes that I grew up with.  To have this
film in my private library is a real treat.  Master Han is a class act (as always).  Having studied Kenpo I had hoped to see Master Parker
step out of his character (in this film) and give more of a demonstration of his incredible hand speed.  But, all in all... it has a reasonably
good plot and was well worth the money.",1208649600,5,391,4.105263157894737
8148168,5,B000IZJQPW,This of course is an older film but you still get to see Mr. Parker in action in this film.  This is a definite martial arts masterpiece.  If your into Kenpo you need to pick this up and see Mr. Parker doing Kenpo.,1195948800,7,214,3.953488372093023
8148169,1,B000IZJQPW,"Too bad there are no ZERO stars.. This ""thing"" would get it.

OK, Parker WAS working for Elvis and so on.

But apart from that, which is extremely minor, WHAT is this thing doing under ""Elvis Presley"" when you search for new Elvis Presley DVD's?

Amazon sure had a strange way to put things together.

Go ahead try it: Type ""Elvis Presley"" in DVD search and you'll get a certain number of DVD's... including this.

Come on Amazon... wake up!",1161216000,4,441,4.4625
