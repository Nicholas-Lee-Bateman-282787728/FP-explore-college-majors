8208206,5,B000T9D6US,My son's favorite part was the Elephant program that Featured both Savanna and Forest Elephants. The other favorite thing in the Rhino program was where all Five modern Rhinos have featured in. Including the CG Woolly Rhino.,1516060800,,224,5.081081081081081
8208207,5,B000T9D6US,I just love this film.  It shows the intelligence of elephants and the wonderful way they relate to each other.  Their family ties are as strong as those of a human family -- maybe even more so.  Thanks for this great documentary.,1368057600,,230,4.428571428571429
