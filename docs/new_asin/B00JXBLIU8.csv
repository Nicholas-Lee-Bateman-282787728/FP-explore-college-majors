6396351,4,B00JXBLIU8,"Short Peace tells the story of four unique short films that are truly worth watching.  Each story's theme range from a artsy psychological thriller to a sci-fi survival story.  Short Peace starts off with Possessions, which is about a Japanese traveler who takes shelter in a magical shelter during a heavy storm.  Inside, he meets magical umbrella creatures, and as you can guess it's all about possessions, and the feeling of desires.  Next, combustible is all about an ancient Japanese firefighter, but it's not as simple as that.  It's more about the feeling of self-destruction and following your own path in life no matter what others say.  Third in the line up is Gambo.  Gambo is basically the story of Gods and Demons.  Gambo is about a spiritual God like Polar Bear who befriends and protects a little girl from an evil demon.  I have to say that Gambo is the best short film in this collection.  Last, we have A Farewell To Weapons, which is a post-apocalyptic story about artificial intelligence and the relationship between technology and war.
I do suggest that when you open the blu-ray make sure you use a knife to cut the factory seal.  If you try to pull in off, it will rip the slipcase packaging.  I was also pleased to find four postcards of each film inside.
The blu-ray is in both Japanese and English, and I was very satisfied with both audio settings.",1408060800,15,1375,4.659751037344399
6396352,5,B00JXBLIU8,"Was it worth the price for it?
When you have no choice in getting a clean legitimate copy of Short Peace but to pay for the high retail, life can be that way....
The four short animation in this compilation all revolve around the common denominator of peace; neglect, respect, forgotten promise, and self destruction.

peace can come at a high cost.....",1407974400,2,353,4.693548387096774

6396356,2,B00JXBLIU8,"Very underwhelming. Short Peace consists of 4 short stories about 15 minutes a piece. No one piece is long enough to have a chance at any meaningful story telling. There is absolutely no connection between the 4 short films, thematically, artisticly or stylistically. There are ZERO special features or additional content. Just felt really down after watching it, and feeling like I just wasted an hour of my life. Don't waste your money on this.",1448323200,2,446,4.96
6396357,1,B00JXBLIU8,"I was mislead by the positive reviews. There's a completely random intro that's a few minutes long, and then there's 4 short stories.

The first one, Possessions, is decent. I enjoyed the art style even though the animation was a bit stiff, which is due to lack of skill. It didn't detract too much from the story at least. But there wasn't much story there anyway.

Next was Combustible, which was about a firefighter in old Japan. There wasn't much development in this one. It was so simple that I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters or the world they lived in.

[SPOILERS] Another one was Gambo, a story about a possessed polar bear. There was a disgusting alien that it fights, but my god the details were beyond disturbing - it was impregnating human women that it kidnapped from a village, and they showed one of them in the alien's spaceship with a giant belly full of swimming aliens, like she was a bubble or something. This particular detail was completely unnecessary and I was severely disappointed in the immense void of imagination exhibited by whoever made this. [END SPOILERS]

Finally, there's A Farewell To Weapons. This was the most well-done short, even though the premise was tired (post-apocalypse, scavenger crew). There was enough thought put into the characters that they weren't bland at least. The world was thoroughly fleshed-out however, and is what made me genuinely want to watch it.

I was extremely disappointed in the quality of these shorts - instead of hinting at deep worlds full of intrigue, it was a boring brush of over-done plots. It is definitely not worth the asking price!",1446249600,4,1631,4.810714285714286
6396358,3,B00JXBLIU8,"It is OK.
I really did not like two Animes in this DVD.",1443657600,,55,3.3076923076923075
6396359,2,B00JXBLIU8,"If that was really 68 minutes long then I'm surprised. It seemed shorter, which made me wonder why the committee didn't take longer and try and make a decent story somewhere in there. There was something about the trailer for this that really wowed me and drew me in. But the real thing is disappointing. For the most part the animation is ok, nothing special, but the stories are very weak. The last one, the military one, was the least weak of a runtish litter for my money.

Some movies I've watched recently and my opinion of them: Patema Inverted (absolutely amazing, and good!). This (see above). Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies (another tasteless and amateurish Jacksonian turd, but then I enjoy Tolkien's written word and I have an imagination). Edge of Tomorrow (again, absolutely amazing and good). So if you can't relate to that last paragraph then you can disregard the first.",1443571200,2,886,4.790849673202614

Each of the vignettes is really distinct visually and thematically. Some are more romantic era influenced, which I do like, while others focus on Otomo's real strength in the future tech.",1443398400,,342,4.532258064516129

6396362,5,B00JXBLIU8,This video was a breath of fresh air. I have been an anime fan for 15 years. I have seen a lot of cliches in anime and stale tropes. These shorts have given me faith that the anime industry is not dead and that there is some real talent still coming to us from Japan. Highly recommended if you are a fan of anime and are tired of the same old plots.,1441152000,2,349,3.861111111111111

6396374,5,B00JXBLIU8,I was a huge fan of the Director of Memories so I bought this. All the short films are very unique in their own regard. If you watch the movies in order its almost funny how drastically the mood changes throughout the four films. Farwell to Arms is worth the purchase alone for the animation in blueray.,1414972800,5,303,4.333333333333333

6396379,1,B00JXBLIU8,"I want to start by saying the one star review has nothing to do with the actual film. Short Peace is an excellent collection of segments done by some of Japan's top anime directors/creators.

Why One star? Sentai Filmworks decided to package this film in a unique slipcase with artwork different than that printed on the actual case insert. Someone thought it a great idea to place large clear tape circles on both ends of the slipcase. If you try to remove them they will rip the slipcase. You will have to get an exacto blade to cut the stickers or careful use scissors to try and get between the sticker and bluray which can also cause tearing to the case. For some this may not be a big deal but to collectors who like to keep the packaging in semi decent condition thus is inexcusable. Slip cases have been used for years now and this is the first time I have seen these type stickers used.",1408406400,11,895,4.359281437125748
8654388,3,B00JXBLIU8,"2.5 stars.

Just finished watching this. The short films on the DVD are not in the same order as in the description. On the disc, they are ""Possessions,"" ""Combustible,"" ""Gambo,"" and ""The End of All Weapons.""

Parental advisory.. (sorry, I can't write this part without a little bit of spoilers, but I don't give anything major away).

The first story is fairly tame, creative, and seems like it was made by Studio Ghibli. It is a bit creepy in parts, but not bad.

Second story is very bleak, but not heavily gory. Not something kids will like. This ain't Pokemon.

Third story is basically a fight between a polar bear and a huge, disgusting demon monster - in the anima films and shows I've seen (I've not watched many), demons do not possess people, they mutilate, rape, murder and eat people. No rape depicted here, or eating people, but humans are slaughtered, and there is some grotesque nudity and an astonishing amount of blood. Yeah.. yuck.

Fourth story.. profanity, PG-13 level violence, blurred out full-frontal male nudity, but not in a sexual context.

---

I'm not a hardcore anime fan. I watched a few series on TV back in the '80's (especially ""Voltron"" - the one with the lions, not the one with the vehicles in space.. and the first two seasons of ""Robotech."")

 Watched some films in college, and as a middle-aged adult, I'm starting to get back into this genre. Just watched one series so far, ""RahXephon,"" which is somewhat incomprehensible, yet mostly amazing. As of the time I'm writing this review - 7/26/18, that title is still streaming on amazon prime..

People who have watched a lot of anime might react differently than I have to these short films.

The first three are set in times long past. The fourth is a sci-fi story.

First one..good. I like some Studio Ghibli titles, and this one reminded me somewhat of those.

Second story - interesting art.. sort of like the ancient Japanese woodblock paintings being animated. The story itself - a real downer, I thought. However, it was quite interesting to see how the Japanese fought fires centuries ago.

Third story.. I suppose many anime fans might be used to tons of blood and gore, and so will be entertained by the third story, but I wasn't. Only thing interesting was a minor character who was a Christian samurai. For a time, there were some samurai clans that had converted to Christianity. Although I knew this I still was a bit  surprised to see a swordsman wearing a cross necklace, and clothes with Christian symbols.. but that was the only thing about the 3rd story I found interesting, even though I am not a religious person.

I thought the 4th story was the best. Interesting sci-fi about a military salvage team in a post-apocolyptic Japan, having to battle unmanned robot tanks. Doesn't sound very original, but it is worth watching.

I really liked the art, especially the haz-mat suits, and some of the weaponry. I wish there were a whole movie or series about this group of soldiers and what they do.

I liked the ending of this one the best. Quite good.

This last story reminded me a bit of some of Philip K. Dick's fiction. If you want sci-fi and weird stories, PKD is the man. Start with his short story collection, ""The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford,"" and don't be put off by the flying shoe on the cover.. can't always judge a book by its cover, right?

And can't always judge a DVD by its cover either. This one really caught my eye as I was browsing in the anime section of the library. But I was somewhat disappointed. Would have been great if all four short films were worth watching.

The title? Seems like just a play on words.. to get our attention, I suppose. Should have just been ""Short Piece,"" or rather, ""Short Pieces.""

Ok then.. you might have a very different reaction to the films on this DVD than I did. Maybe you will like all four of the films.",1532649600,,3879,4.581765557163531

8654390,1,B00JXBLIU8,"Only two redeeming parts to this film: the intro segment, and the final segment (based on Otomo Katsuhiro's own short story art, yet weirdly not directed by him). The rest---including Otomo's own directed featurette---are shockingly bad.",1512691200,,237,5.611111111111111

8654393,3,B00JXBLIU8,"The intro gives off a feel of being trapped in a video game which is interesting except for the strange event that results at its end which was a little disturbing. The first story Possessions is ok it has a video game cell shaded style of art. The story is clean and a little funny at spots. The second story Combustible art style reminds me of either the Sims 2 or Populous over head angle view. The story well you will have to see it to understand it because I should could not. The third story Gambo is ... Well if you have seen the trailer it was misleading. This story is no Disney cute Jungle book story japan style. The cute girl and her protecting polar bear dancing and singing in the woods think again. All I can say is graphic violence, alot of blood and disturbing scenes. The final story Farewell to Weapons great art work style even though everything today is digital graphic instead of ink and paint. The story is disappointing to me. It starts great but ends unfinished. The twist at the end was dumb and unessessary. Lets put it this way it was gross and a wasted opportunity to have a epic or emotional ending. Typical anime. Anime has the art all they need is the proper story telling.",1482883200,,1205,4.36

8654396,5,B00JXBLIU8,"I was initially put off by the intro, though it seems reminiscent of the intro to a similar collection from the 90's (Manie Manie, I think?) and might have been an homage of sorts.

Without going into the details of the shorts, know that they're about as different from each other as can be.  I found the last & longest (Farewell to Weapons) to be worth the price of the disc, by itself.  While some have complained about the whole ""post-apocalyptic scavenging adventure"" being too unoriginal, what made it special for me is the production quality, attention to detail, and the shear imagination that went into what future warfare might be like.

The only real complaint I have is that Gambo (second from last, featuring a polar bear) was a bit more explicit than necessary (its director seems to be a fan of Predator & the Aliens series), but I don't want to overstate the point, and wouldn't put it quite on the level of Aliens or Prometheus.

Anyway, if you enjoy collections of shorts, such as Memories, Coicent & Five Numbers, Robot Carnival, etc. you'll certainly find something you like, here.  Please show your support for the creators and publishers, so we keep getting more of these works released in the US.

BTW, I really enjoyed the Japanese 5.1 audio track.  I did have some issues with the subtitles showing too briefly, but I found that the issue had abated after resetting my player and resuming from that point.  I've probably only seen something like that on one other disc.",1459036800,3,1493,4.689655172413793
