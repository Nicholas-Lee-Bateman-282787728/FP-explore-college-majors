8637826,5,B00I09B0QG,"Absolutely fantastic teacher!!!
I bought the all three volumes for my husband who wanted to add something extra to his jazz gigs, and he is still working through the theory of the first DVD without even transposing to saxophone - he's very happy with the lessons because it's difficult to get this kind of teaching in the UK. Well worth the money and I'd happily pay the same again.",1430611200,2,382,4.550724637681159
8637827,5,B00I09B0QG,"This video is chock FULL of all things saxophone. Form basics to advanced multiphonics the best part is Jerrys teaching style. As phenomenal as Jerry plays on records, he is such an inspiring as a teacher that you feel hes been in your shoes. Put the time in and hear your own voice come out of the saxophone. His wisdom is deep. He shares freely and this DVD will keep you playing and having fun for years.",1402790400,3,407,4.298701298701299
8637828,5,B00I09B0QG,"This DVD is filled with an amazing amount of info, without a lot of BS thrown in. Jerry speaks directly to you in an easy going, easy to understand manner. He goes over  technique, equipment, approaches to tone, a lot of basics that no matter what level you play at are great to hear about from his perspective. Like sitting down with the guy in a room and getting to ask him everything you always wanted to know about the sax. Comes with some tunes to play along with, stuff to listen to, etc. Great info, at great price.",1402358400,3,522,4.2727272727272725
8637829,5,B00I09B0QG,"I have just  just begun my lesson on DVD with Jerry on Sax mastery & despite having played for 12 years, a graduate of the New School Jazz Program here in Ne York city  &  having played with some of the greats in NYC & last but not least  2 years of study with the great "" George Garzone ""  I now have at my fingertips with this DVD an opportunity to increase my playing ability ten fold to say the least. This disc is so full of rare gems & revelations that I find myself unable to find the words to explain how excited & inspired I am at the moment. There is enough material on this wonderful disc to keep me busy for at least a year if not 2.
Jerry & Falk the producer  I thank you both from the bottom of my heart

This is an incredible step forward in Jazz education. I just viewed the DVD for the second time tonight & I am still reeling from the experience.  Not only is Bergonzi a masterful musician but he is also in my opinion an exceptionally kind human being who really cares about this music & his students.
Sorry for the long review. I am so excited, and can't wait to get started. I also have the first 2 DVD's in this series which are just a treasure trove of information regarding  harmony, II V's subs, etc.  Pick up these discs you will not regret it .
 Respectfully yours
Robert H. McGowan. BFA.
