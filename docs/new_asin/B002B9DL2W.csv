8360868,5,B002B9DL2W,"This is a very well done documentary on one of the most fascinating and virtually unknown stories, in American history--of how a group of young women from from the Fort Shaw Indian Boarding School (not necessarily there by choice) became, around the turn of last century, a virtually unbeatable girls' basketball team and, in 1904, were crowned ""Champions of  the World"" at the St. Louis World's Fair. If someone just made this up you would pass it off as too fanciful to believe, but it is true. The story is well told in this documentary with a mixture of  old photographs, interviews with descendants of the players and two women historians who uncovered the story, and some delightful re-enactments by present day Native American girls and various townspeople. Just an amazing story and of particular interest to women's history, Native American history and sport's history--though play basketball is not ALL these young women did well.",1368057600,3,940,5.058064516129032
8360869,5,B002B9DL2W,"The documentary ""Playing for the World"", based on the mesmerizing story, ""Full Court Quest"", takes the us back in time. It introduces today's reader to the 1904 World Champion Fort Shaw Indian Boarding School girls' basketball team. At the height of their power, the victories of these invincible juggernauts were no less than awe-inspiring, especially considering the society in which they lived and were forced to adapt to. Although I have enjoyed it three times already, such a story as this deserves to have some ""real money"" backers to bring it to the big screen. Both the docu-drama and the book are highly recommended by this viewer-reader. What a story!

8360870,5,B002B9DL2W,We were lent this movie by a co-worker & used it for part of our Diversity requirement ... It is a very good video & seemed to touch on both the positives and negatives attached to Indian boarding schools to a small degree -- but was very focused on the positive accomplishments of these young Indian women.  Was nice to see a positive side....,1313366400,4,344,4.375
