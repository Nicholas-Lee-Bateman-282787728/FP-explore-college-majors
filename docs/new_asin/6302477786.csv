472425,5,6302477786,"Watching Ed Sullivan on Sunday night was an American tradition. He came out with his squinchy little body and his upraised hands and  told us all that it was going to be a 'really big really big sheww' . 'Let's hear it for Curtis Le May from SAC. He 's going to bomb the Commies into Smithereens' Down there in the front row say a big hello to one of the great champeens of all time. Let's hear it for Jack Dempsey'

Ed would begin that way introducing the celebrities and warming us for Toppo Gigio the Little Italian Mouse or for , a young man from Memphis , Tennessee ( Ed could hardly hide the distaste as he pronounced the words ) Elvis Presley. ""

The video contains records of some of the highlight performances, and also an interview with Ed and his wife Sylvia.

Highlights are wonderful, but my sense is that putting together a package in which the complete shows as they came on at the time would give a dimension no excerpts can.",1150070400,11,941,4.299435028248587
472426,5,6302477786,"This video contains some truly great moments on the Ed Sullivan show, including performances by such groups as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Byrds, Rolling Stones, and much much more!  Get this video and you will not  be dissappointed!",939427200,15,237,5.051282051282051

472491,5,6302477786,"Imagine, no cursing or smut....imagine Ella's crystal clear voice, the eruption when Ed said 2 little words: 'The Beatles'; the roar when the ventriloquist went mum; the laughs, the clowns, Senor Wences.........a different age, a different world view- thanks Ed! Good things may pass, but the camera remembers!",1354665600,,310,5.479166666666667
472492,5,6302477786,"Most likely after viewing volume 1, you will go straight for volume 2 of The Very Best of the Ed Sullivan Show. It is more of the same with the continuity of incredible performances. Of course, this one will have Elvis and The Beatles as usual. Probably the funniest are the impersonations. One amazing display of a feat is Gene Kelly's handle on Ed Sullivan. It has to be seen to believe. All in all, forget the American Idol and America's Got (No) Talent crap...The Very Best of the Ed Sullivan Show, Vol. 2 is a great time capsule of history that is worth watching.",1345420800,,568,4.419047619047619

472494,2,6302477786,"I first saw this special when it aired on TV nearly 20 years ago. My parents recorded it on VHS and we'd watch it regularly. I just purchased this and Volume 1. I'm pretty disappointed in both. Having watched them regularly growing up, I can tell there has been editing done. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Granted, some of the highlight performances are slightly extended (notably ""Camelot""). But certain segments of Burt Reynolds are gone completely (I distinctly remember, following Albert Brooks' clip, it cut to Burt Reynolds saying how much he liked Brooks; that's not on the DVD). There are also some performances that are noticeably cut. I don't remember which volume it was, but one featured a sketch by Red Skelton where he talked about Texas. It's gone, it's not on either volume.
I really expected the opposite: to see what was aired on television, plus some, not minus some. As much as I enjoy the classic performances--worth the purchase--I'm disappointed with the editing.",1318291200,11,994,4.9226190476190474
472495,5,6302477786,"I did not know what to expect here, but the DVD is just great and really brought back a lot of forgotten memories about the Ed Sullivan era.  Recommend this to everybody.",1276992000,,170,4.3125
472496,4,6302477786,"I purchased volumes 1 & 2 for my brother who was turning 50.  He said it was the best gift he had received in years.  He absolutely loved watching the bands of his youth and has watched them many times over (not to mention the delight in torturing his 15 year old daughter).  The audio's not bad, the filming is somewhat cut up....but it's better to see something of these past performers than nothing at all.  My husband is also 50 (I am 45) and we bought the set for ourselves too.  Fun to watch, especially if having a party or friends over.",1256774400,2,544,4.242718446601942
472497,3,6302477786,"I could not wait to watch this classic.  It have all the stars that it talked about, but I have to say I was very disappointed.  It only has clips of the performances and I had hoped for all the songs.",1249430400,7,201,3.8780487804878048
