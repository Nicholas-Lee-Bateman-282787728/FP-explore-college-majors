8599761,1,B00E0HJEBA,"Being a die-hard Floyd fan from the beginning of their career to this day, I was excited about a new documentary. ""The Wall Before and After"" claims to be a new documentary released in 2013; one is led to believe that this is a newly created documentary focusing on ""The Wall.""

Read the following information carefully:

This is NOT a new documentary feature called ""The Wall - Before and After""

It is instead, ""Whatever Happened to Pink Floyd,"" with the exact same set of bonuses, but with far less appealing front and back artwork.

This is not widescreen 2.35:1 as Amazon's description proclaims. It is instead, standard 1.33:1 full-frame.

If ""Whatever Happened to Pink Floyd"" was out-of-print, ""The Wall - Before and After"" would be a great purchase, because ""Whatever Happened to Pink Floyd"" is a really solid, well-produced documentary and worth the purchase.

But it is not out of print and ""The Wall - Before and After"" is just a re-named, re-packaged clone.

I am making sellers aware of this fact.",1389571200,7,1010,4.837209302325581
