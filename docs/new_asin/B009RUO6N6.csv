8543938,5,B009RUO6N6,"I recently ordered 3 different instructional videos for my new camera. It was the first time I have had a chance to compare the different camera video vendors.  Without a doubt, the Elite Video selection was the best.  Clear instructions, product specific and easy to locate different chapters.  Each part of the camera was described in depth.  With that help, I now choose not to use the 'point n punch' option on my camera.  My results are a pleasure to show to friends/family.  Excellent product!",1363564800,,499,4.811764705882353
8543939,4,B009RUO6N6,"I Got the D800 Made Easy DVD video because I have mainly used program mode in the past (had a D60) and wanted to get really good at the other modes now that I spent a lot on this Nikon. . I found the DVD covered everything I needed to know. The topics presented were done in an easy to follow friendly, (sometimes fun) manner among three presenters.

In the beginning of the DVD they suggest watching no more than 15 minutes in one sitting because you might get overwhelmed. I found that to be true. Taking it in small chunks was best. The D800 camera is so feature packed that I wonder if they covered everything in the 1 hour 45 minutes- They cover most everything though. Each section moves pretty fast and only once did I feel intimidated by the lingo used. If you own this camera, this DVD is something I found invaluable. I know much more about the camera after watching it over a week's time",1353628800,,898,4.2823529411764705
8543940,1,B009RUO6N6,This training video is terrible. It is amateurishly produced and the presenters are not skilled trainers. It's really a D800 training video with a few short clips on the D600 sprinkled in during segments where the two cameras differ. One star in my opinion.,1353283200,,257,4.863636363636363
