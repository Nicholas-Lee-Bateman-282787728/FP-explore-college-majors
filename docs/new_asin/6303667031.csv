The seller was great! Affordable price, quick delivery, the product was in perfect condition. No vhs issues or anything. *****",1288656000,,296,4.303571428571429
698331,5,6303667031,"Magic Island is a wonderfull movie.  It is funny, entertaining, imaginative, and captivating.  It gives a child, or adult, for that matter, a chance to escape today's hurried, and sometimes depressing reality, and let their imagination soar. My family has enjoyed this film for years, and, still do enjoy it today.  The quality of the film itself was good, and shipping was very prompt.  Thanks for the help in making this find and purchase possible.",1271203200,,450,4.96
698332,5,6303667031,"I can't BELIEVE this hasn't been put out on DVD yet!! What's up Paramount? It will be well worth it! If you haven't seen this yet, pick up a copy if you can!! The price is so high because so many people love this film and there's a great lack of copies.. Well worth it if you can get it, you're kids will love it!",1221004800,,313,3.830769230769231
698333,5,6303667031,"Jack Carlysle is an only child in a single family home with a mom who is working all the time.
He wants to run away from home until his nanny gives him a book of adventure.
As Jack sleeps he is awakened by the sound of pirates and is sucked into the book and goes on a fun hilarious adventure.

I don't know why they put crummy movies on DVD but not good ones like these.
If you can get a used vhs copy it would be well worth it.
Your kids will love this movie.
I still enjoy it at 42.",1184198400,5,485,3.7549019607843137
698334,1,6303667031,"This movie is so poorly made that it's actually funny, but only if you watch it with children. The acting is bad and the costumes look like Halloween costumes. My kids asked me a little while ago what a ""B"" movie is, and finally I could show them an example: This movie!",1162684800,,270,4.211538461538462

698336,3,6303667031,"...and corny, and anachronistic, and rife with hammy acting.  And the mermaid's tail wasn't very believable, and the sand shark patently stunk.
But at least the acting was *deliberately* hammy...at least on the part of the three or four actors that I recognized by sight. (I *know* that all of 'em have enough talent to not make fools of themselves by *accident.*)  And it's a great improvement over other Paramount kiddie fare (the ""Josh Kirby: Time Warrior"" flicks come to mind).

Watch this movie from a kid's perspective, and you'll enjoy it.  Trust me on this.",1038873600,3,565,4.854166666666667

698338,5,6303667031,We rented this for my five-year old and he loved every minute- we watched it three times in three days  It is funny and action-packed without being overly violent.  The premise of the story is cool and anything with Blackbeard is a hit for young pirate lovers! It was a sleeper for us since we had never heard of it.  Too bad it's out of  stock!,985996800,5,345,4.181818181818182
7852341,5,6303667031,"If you're feeling nostalgic and wanting to go back to the days of sub par graphics but excellent story telling and acting, then I highly reccomwnd this movie. It was a childhood favorite of mine so when I watched it again I was very reminiscent. A great movie to watch with the kids!",1499990400,,283,4.3584905660377355

7852345,2,6303667031,Slapstickish and stupid with cartoon sound effects from the '50s.  The stone statue shown coming to life in the preview is the only scene like that in this whole dumb boring movie!  Not fun or funny.,1476230400,,199,4.5

7852347,5,6303667031,"I have been searching for this movie everywhere and have had no luck. i wish it was available in DVD format but i love that if you don't want to make a digital purchase of the film you can simply purchase it for a 48 hour rental, watchable via your computer, xbox, playstation, or other streaming devices such as Roku or Amazon Fire stick.",1473206400,,339,4.3125

7852349,5,6303667031,"Used to have this recorded on VHS from the Disney channel.  Showed it to my nieces and nephew, i think they got a kick out of it as much as i did.  It's like The Princess Bride meets The Neverending Story meets Pirates of the Carribean before that film existed.  The acting is silly at times but as an adult i've grown fond of it.  A bit pricey though, hopefully it will be available in digital format one day.",1453593600,,410,4.151898734177215
