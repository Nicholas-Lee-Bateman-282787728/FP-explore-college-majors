8289603,4,B001CU9ECC,"Ancient Discoveries: Superships is a very good documentary which deals with antiquity's largest naval vessels. The amount of effort and research put into this project is significant and as a result the documentary helps transport the viewer to another time allowing one to lay eyes on legendary ships such as those belonging to the Pharaoh Khufu, Ptolemy IV, and Archimedes' wonder, the Syracusae, among several others to mention a few.
Very well written and very well presented, this documentary is guaranteed to provide the viewer with significant knowledge regarding shipping and shipbuilding in antiquity.
The only major setback is that the History Channel labels and refers to Asia Minor (from beginning to end) as ""Turkey"" with no mention of the lands in question constituting ""Modern Turkey,"" thus creating the illusion and/or misconception that Turks inhabited the region centuries before the 1071 AD Battle of Manzikert. I do not believe the History Channel just happened to miss that. Is someone maybe trying to give much more significance to certain groups than is deserving or historically accurate???  The truth, whatever it might be, must be protected at all cost and not be left to be sacrificed in pursuit of political agendas.
Despite its shortcomings, Ancient Discoveries: Superships is strongly recommended to all those with a soft spot for Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome.",1248652800,,1408,5.313901345291479
8289604,3,B001CU9ECC,"""Superships"" tells what archaeologists have learned about large ancient ships of up to 311' in length and 100' width - serving both as cargo ships (carrying large stones for the pyramids) and warships (with 4,000 rowers, and a complement of marines and a catapult for protection).  Largest of all was the ""Syracusea,"" capable of transporting up to 2,000 tons of cargo, propelled by three masts, and drawing 4,000 tons.

The material was only mildly interesting, and there was no reference to the great ships of Chinese origin.",1224720000,,526,5.0344827586206895
