8136341,4,6303473253,"I just watched this video.  It presented a very good presentation of basic dance steps.  The instructor's oral delivery was clear and easy to understand, and the demonstrations of the moves were broken down into easy-to-follow steps.

After the step-by-step demonstrations, the video presents dancers on the ballroom floor, dancing to the sounds of a big-band, performing the same dances just taught.

This video is helpful and engaging.  Very good value.",1131580800,,455,5.352112676056338
8136342,3,6303473253,"In response to the above review: From what I understand, you have to watch  the introductory video ""Bring Back the Romance of Dance: Instruction  Series Overview"" to learn the basic steps. Then you watch these videos  to go into more detail on particular dances.",962755200,10,262,4.909090909090909
