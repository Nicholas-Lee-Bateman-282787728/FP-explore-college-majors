8322685,5,B001N0E82M,"I have been practicing Shotokan for about a year now and bought this video to help me stay in shape. I recently broke my foot and haven't been able to go to class and learn, so I wanted something that would go over the kata that I already knew, and teach me the next one I should be learning. This video did just that. It has great production value, breaks down the moves in the kata slowly so that you can learn them, and shows you  what else you need to know for your belt test. I recommend this video to anyone that is looking to supplement what they learn at their dojo and for those who want to learn Shotokan, but don't have a school nearby that teaches it.",1347148800,2,663,4.1
8322686,5,B001N0E82M,"Sensei Amos's latest instructional DVD video, like the previously produced Vol. 1 & 2 is exceedingly well done.  It is a sure safe buy for one interested in obtaining a professionally produced DVD of the kata's Heian Yondan and Godan.

There are not many shotokan karate videos that measure up to the content presented in this DVD.",1233878400,4,331,4.7894736842105265
