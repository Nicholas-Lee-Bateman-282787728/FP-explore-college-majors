1044077,1,6305526079,The original screen version is far superior to this stinker. Isn't there anyone in Hollywood who can write comedy?  Hollywood screen writers seem to be stuck on a constant diet of tired sex jokes and innuendos.  This movie  is a heavy bomber.  Don't waste your time.,940032000,5,266,4.717391304347826
1044078,5,6305526079,"This movie is so uproariously(is that the word?) hilarious, it simply can't be put into words without lessening the quality. IT IS THAT GOOD! I love every movie Steve Martin has been in. Goldie Hawn is one of the  greatest. But it is John Cleese who steals the show as a cross-dressing  hotel manager. The dancing scene with Cleese high-kicking to ""Bad  Girls"" is virtually unmatchable in hilariousness. This movie  definitely stands out above the rest.",939686400,2,453,4.921052631578948

1044161,2,6305526079,"Not nearly as good as the original.  This version includes too many sight gags and jokes that do not work.  I did not even get a smile out of it, and I like Martin and Hawn.",1499212800,,173,3.7777777777777777
1044162,3,6305526079,"Not a bad comedy.  If the travesty of mishaps were not to typical of what really can go wrong in our travels, it could have been a drama instead of a comedy.  I am sure most viewers can relate to this film.  Likeable characters.",1499126400,,228,4.136363636363637
1044163,1,6305526079,"I have seen the original film with Jack Lemmon a few times so I expected as much fun watching this newer version. But boy was I wrong!
The plot is crudely based on the original plot with some major variations. However, what is lost in all of this is the charm and humor of the original movie. I generally like Steve Martin but for some reason his performance here is so wooden and scripted that you could barely get a laugh out of his jokes. For example, his reactions to catastrophic events in his trip is as exciting as if him dropping a pen to the floor. It appeared the movie was a high school weekend shtick. Goldie Hawn's performance was even worse and at her older age, her romantic overtures appeared distasteful and unappetizing. The entire movie was boring and unfunny and I imagine, embarrassing for the two famous actors and John Cleese. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

In retrospect, the original Out of Towners was made for Jack Lemmon's personality and his unique hyperactive persona. There is no modern comedian that could fill his shoes, though I could think of better choices than Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn for a remake.",1499040000,,1153,4.597087378640777
1044164,1,6305526079,"The movie is slow and unfunny.  The protagonists are unpleasant individually and together.  I find myself rooting against them, and after only a few minutes wondering why they never got divorced.",1499040000,,195,5.258064516129032

1044166,4,6305526079,"The Out of Towners was a good movie.  Its a revival of the 1970 movie hosting Jack Lemmon one of my favorite actors of past times.

The new version of this movie with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn is just that.  A copy cat of the movie with more whimsical pieces similar to the 1970 plot.  For anyone like me, a New Yorker, you will definitely understand this movie and can find appreciation to what out of towners much experience when trying to be forced to figure out this big city and all the oddness it offers.  Found it amusing and a delight.

Recommend this movie for those with a heart for classics and fans of Steve Martin and Golden Hawn.",1498435200,4,646,4.297520661157025

1044201,1,6305526079,"At the top of my ""Worst Movie Ever Made"" is this big pile of rubbish!  In fact - it's at the top of my wife's list too.  Actually worse than ""The Constant Gardener"" of ""Project-A"".

My wife kicked back expecting this stellar cast to provide us a great movie.  About 20 minutes in we were still waiting to laugh.  40 minutes more and we were looking at one another with that ""What have we gotten ourselves into?"" look.  At 60 minutes in we both were tearing each others hair out and finally stopped torturing ourselves by hitting the stop button.  For a brief moment we believed our TV might be trying to kill us as it didn't stop the pain and horror of this movie right away.

For the love of all that is funny... stay away from this one!

Martin, Hawn, and even Cleese were phoning in their performances.

1044678,3,6305526079,"I watched this movie because I am a big Steve Martin fan.  I can take or leave Goldie Hawn.  Steve is an advertising executive married to Goldie.  He's just lost his job and needs to get to Manhattan for a job interview.  From the very outset however, nothing goes well, and it is as if fate is throwing every obstacle in his way to make it to NY. The situations are quite contrived and bordering on the absurd.  There are cameo appearances sprinkled throughout the movie including one by Mayor Giuliani. One of the best performances is by John Cleese of Monty Python fame, who plays a cross dressing manager of a luxury hotel.  The movie reminded me of a ""road trip""  experience with little character development and not much of a plot.  It felt like the actors were just calling this one in.  Overall, the movie was mildly entertaining.  You could watch it while doing other things around the house and not worry about missing anything.",1364601600,,938,4.562874251497006
1044679,3,6305526079,"The premise of this movie was showing an aging man and wife couple (emptynesters) from Ohio having to go to NYC for the husband's job interview and how such naive midwesterners are abused by the city but overcome. However, typical liberal Hollywood has to interject its craziness into the plot. For example, two middle aged married Ohioans are not going to show up in NYC and have sex in a garden to get caught by people dedicating a statue in the garden and chased by the police. They are also not going to blackmail a transvestite to get a free room. They are not going to steal a meal from a guy looking to pick up a ""date"" at a hotel bar. Too much of a ""coincidence"" that they try and crash a sexaholics meeting for the free food, only to spend their first stolen dollars on a cab ride the next. It isn't that ""middle Americans"" as everyone outside of LA and NYC and SF are derogatorily referred to, and in this movie depicted as ""Ohioans"", don't have survival instincts or that all ""other"" Americans are Apple pie church going folk . . . it is that most know that is wrong and live a true right and wrong life like most outside of SF, LA, and NYC. That just wouldn't make for a ""fun"" movie. So Hollywood has to interject this as it is blinded by its moral corruption and a dry well of imagination. It clearly isn't for comedy. Anyway there are some redeeming qualities to this film (the husband and wife strangely get closer by actually sharing their lives again . . . being partners again . . . only after . . . oh wanting to call their marriage quits about 3 different times) but over all it is just a seen that heard that film that seems to be made only to give two aging Hollywood stars another film to ""star"" in.

This remake from '99 was not bad (I rented it from Netflix), and Martin and Hawn were funny (I thought they were wonderful, and they are excellent actors), and this version was funny in general, but I felt that it wouldn't hold a candle to the 1970 movie. Martin and Hawn's characters go through similar mishaps like the characters from the original, but there are a few twists to the remake: the hotel manager is secretly seen wearing a woman's sable fur coat and a freaky looking cap while dancing and lip-syncing to the Donna Summer hit, Bad Girls, a vicious dog that lives in an apartment goes charging after the couple, to where the couple mistakenly walk into a group therapy meeting overhearing a man talk about masturbation, etc. Sure, this '99 version is funny to a degree, but I think the Lemmon and Dennis version from '70 is funnier. I feel that when a certain movie is remade years later after an original, the remake probably won't be as popular and maybe not well-received as the original was.

The plane is out-routed, nearly out-sourced, their deluxe rental car has no air conditioning. They get lost because they don't know how to read a map, and then their rental GPS gets stuck in some kind of French sounding neighborhood and they end up in a fish-market or something like that with crates and fresh squishy things. 2,200 dollars for a 200 mile, at the most, ride. At the hotel they are kicked out because their credit card has been overdrawn by their own daughter. And that's only part of the beginning. Get to that film to discover the hundreds of details and risks out-of-towners run in New York City, an apple in which any smiling friendly face may be the worm that is eating the core of it.

  The Clark's son, Alan (Oliver Hudson, Goldie Hawn's real-life son) has finally left the coop and on to Europe.  Henry Clark (Steve Martin) has an idea that now is the time to leave Iowa and get a higher-paying job in New York.  Actually, he got fired from his weak advertising job and doesn't have the heart to tell his wife, Nancy (Goldie Hawn).

  So Henry is on his way by airplane to New York.  Could have been an ordinary trip, but Nancy suddenly runs on the airplane to surprise her husband.  She announces that she has brought her husband's rash cream.  That's not all, they can't land in New York City because it is fogged in.  So the plane lands in God-forgotten Boston.

  And so with that, getting to New York in time for the important job interview is going to be an adventure of its own.  Everything goes wrong.

  Also in the cast: John Cleese, Mark McKinney, Carlease Burke, Ernie Sabella, James Arone, Chris McKinney, then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

  This movie was filmed and released before the reality TV series, ""Amazing Race"" premiered on Sept. 5, 2001.  Perhaps the Out-Of-Towners films gave them the idea.

1044997,3,6305526079,"Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn have reputations that precede them, and when they're in a movie together, you know it's going to be a mildly funny screwball comedy.  That's exactly what this movie turns out to be.
This is the story of Henry and Nancy Clark (Martin and Hawn, respectively), an Ohio couple who have a son that they've just sent off to study abroad for a year, and a daughter who quit medical school to become an actress in New York.  Henry has just gotten fired from his job at an advertising firm and now he must go to New York City to interview for a job at the only company that's interested in hiring him.  Nancy tags along on the trip, and before you know it, the adventure begins.  They begin by having their plane re-routed to Boston and the airline losing their luggage.  They can't get a bus to New York City, they miss the Amtrak by just a few seconds, and then they get stuck with a rental car with a heater that won't shut off.  They damage their rental car, get mugged by an Andrew Lloyd Webber impersonator, and get kicked out of their hotel.
All of that happens in just the first 20 minutes of the movie.  These problems and inconveniences keep mounting, and during the whole time they're looking for food to quell their hunger, a place to rest, and a way to kick-start their stagnant marriage.  Like I already mentioned, this movie is mildly funny, but still not on par with other movies these two actors have made.  Steve Martin is a veteran of these types of comedies, but he's not as good here as he was in movies like ""Father of the Bride"".  He's always been great at playing the well-intentioned goof, but he just doesn't sell it as well here.  Goldie Hawn is an Academy Award winner, but it's clear that her best work is behind her.  She's also been in better movies of this genre.
In the grand scheme of things, this movie will probably rank as one of the lesser works on these two actors' resumes.  However, if you're looking to entertain yourself for 90 minutes, this movie will do the job.",1042675200,4,2027,4.387700534759358

1045000,2,6305526079,"Thirty years ago, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis starred in the original version of The Out of Towners. It was moderately successful with the public and the media. As society changed over time, so did much of what we find humorous. Back then, it was funny when the Beaver disobeyed his parents. Today, much laughter is evoked when an audience sees a kid who does obey. The Beaver would be an outcast, a nerd. We have become enormously more worldly.
As was the original, the remake of The Out of Towners is a comedy about a series of mishaps that befall a naive Ohio couple when they venture to New York City. Their plane is rerouted to Boston. They fail to catch a train from there to the Big Apple. Then they rent a car, which they wreck minutes after arriving in Manhattan. Things go downhill from there.
This unfortunate pair is Harry and Nancy Clark, played by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. Both stars give it their all, but they are no match for the way Lemmon and Dennis portrayed the couple. Hawn and Martin are comedians whose success depends on the material they are given to work with. [This is why Martin excels in movies he writes and/or directs.] Dennis and Lemmon were serious actors who can cross over into comedy. What was so funny in the original was the way the two took the mishaps so seriously. They looked and acted like an innocent Midwestern pair. Martin and Hawn come off as too glib and sophisticated to ever have such events happen to them.
The movie has its moments, especially when Martin is seemingly allowed to ad-lib. His scene in Central Park, where he winds up after accidentally taking a hallucinogenic drug, is priceless. The incredible Englishman, John Cleese, has his moments as an ultra-snobbish hotel manager.
Perhaps the major problem with The Out of Towners is that the story is dated in ways no rewrite could fix. New York has changed dramatically. I find much of it to be safer and friendlier than many other big cities. Times Square, once the haunt of panhandlers and prostitutes, now seems about as dangerous as Disneyland. Harry Clark is successful in the advertising business, and Nancy was once his partner, Jetting from place to place is the norm for such professionals these days, and it no longer makes sense that he hasn't been to New York before. People from the sticks are way more sophisticated than they were thirty years ago. They simply don't freak out like they used to when they go to big cities. The yokel and the redneck are dying breeds. So, today's Harry and Nancy don't seem like a couple accidentally caught in an urban hell. They seem simply ignorant.",1016668800,18,2616,4.627956989247312

John Cleese of Monty Python's Flying Circus and Mark McKinney of the Kids in the Hall round out the supporting cast... in VERY funny performances!
The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a perfect review is the way it got all sappy towards the end.  It was like the makers of the film suddenly decided to turn it into a dramedy, rather than the all out comic farce it was leading up to that point.

The problem with this remake of the Lemmon-Dennis classic is that we've seen it all before done much better.  See ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", ""Dutch"", ""Fandango"" and Martin's own ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"".  Any one of these ""travelling comedy of errors"" is considerably more humorous.  When the original came out it was something new.  It had Jack Lemmon going over the top and really getting the most out of every scene in the film.  Lemmon screaming at the top of his lungs-taking down everybody's address, dealing with the cab driver, the dark stranger in Central Park, the fight with the dog over the Cracker Jacks, the chipped tooth, Murray the hotel locator, rain and garbage all over the streets, broken heal and just so much more.  Steve Martin's version of George Kellerman is lazy and nearly humorless.  It loses sight of the original's comic storyline:  New York kicking this simple Ohio couple's butt at every turn and the couple deciding to go back home.  It does have Cleese as a closet transvestite (perhaps the films only funny moments).  Check out the original or one of the other films mentioned here.

Goldie takes it harder than Steve does, as Steve has the Loss of his Job on his mind. With a Job Interview in New York, the pair head for the Big Apple, and the film follows their Misadventures through the city that Never Sleeps.
""The Out of Towner's"" may not go down in the History books as the Funniest film Ever Made, but it Will Entertain an Undemanding Audience simply looking for a few Laughs. Goldie and Steve make a Great on-screen couple, it's a Real Shame that every time they are Partnered up, they are also partnered with Average Material. The Screenplay is the problem as it quite simply isn't very funny. The jokes have been Recycled from the Original ""Out of Towner's"", nearly Every Other Neil Simon film or play and from a Countless number of latter-day Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau road movies. Some of the jokes even date back to the Bob Hope / Bing Crosby road movie days. When that starts happening, the screen writer should realise that it's time for a Rewrite or two.
Still, It's Goldie and Steve to the rescue, as they Save the film from itself and make it Enjoyable nonetheless. John Cleese chips in here and there as a Snooty Upper-class Hotel Manager with a Penchant for Woman's Clothing. Some will Undoubtable find this role Annoying, Demeaning or just plain Stupid, but others will find it Funny, as I did. The Whole Three of them are called upon to act pretty Silly now and then, but they pull it off.
Directing and Technical Credits are Average, nothing special... In fact, the Whole Film has a ""Nothing Special"" kind of Feel about it, no one except the three Principle Performers seem to be trying very hard, but If you Accept that Going In, you'll have a Lot more fun with it.",989193600,2,2032,4.524456521739131
1045054,3,6305526079,"Marc Lawrence's script for the remake of ""The Out-of-Towners"" is not without its flaws, but that doesn't stop it from being a watchable comedy that rides on the performances of its two leads. Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are two of the most well-enjoyed comedic talents Hollywood has to offer, and they pretty much make the movie surprisingly enjoyable despite some unfunny scenes and a formulaic plot.
Henry and Nancy Clark live out their routine lives in Ohio, so it comes as no little surprise that when there only son goes off to college abroad, their lives seem listless and uneventful. Henry has lost his job, but keeps it from Nancy when he is offered a position in an advertising firm in New York. Nancy sees it as the perfect way to spark some romance back into their marriage, and off they go, only to be laid over in Boston, where they must rent an expensive car, finally reaching the big city only to run into more problems.
The obstacles, like the primary setup, are pretty basic: they are mugged in the middle of the street, their hotel will not accept their credit card, which is low on funds, which leaves them on the streets trying to think of ways to come up with money for the room. Some of these prove to be quite funny and entertaining, while other scenarios, one of which involves Martin on an overdose of hallucenogenics, seem forced and a bit agonizing for the actors. The laughs seem to die out a bit in the end, but the first two thirds of the film make up for it.
Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are the perfect comedy team for the movie, bringing the laughs on even in places where you least expect it. Martin plays Henry to be very nervous in times of tension, giving his character a goofy and awkward trait that makes him easier to laugh at. Hawn is definitely the smarter of the two, but still retains that little girl quality that makes her performances so superb. Her facial expressions, and even the tone of her voice, keep the movie upbeat and happy, which is one of its salvage factors.
Not a whole lot to say about this movie, except it's one of those like-it or hate-it comedies where the stars do their very best, and that alone makes it enjoyable. It's best not to try and compare this movie to the original version: the two are so very different and spaced apart that there really is no point. There's really no point to the movie, either, but that's half the fun of it.",985996800,,2408,4.450226244343892
1045055,3,6305526079,"The Out of Towners was silly & predictable.  Having said that, I really enjoyed it.  Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn were great in the story of a husband and wife who must rediscover themselves to make their marriage work.  They have to get to New York in 24 hours for a job interview.  They experience delays, lost luggage, the works.  The audience has seen this stuff before, but Martin & Hawn do such a good job, you don't really mind the repeat.  John Cleese does seem silly, but you have to admit, that hat is funny! It is not a classic, but it is definitely worth the price of rental.",978393600,2,587,4.290909090909091
1045056,4,6305526079,"I despise Goldie Hawn usually, and I found her very funny and touching in this movie as a supportive wife who's sacrificed her career for her children and now hopes to ""suck the marrow"" out of life.
Steve Martin, as always, is hilarious. He is partially reprising his role in the BRILLIANT ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" with a vengeance in this film. His attempt at controlling his demeanor at the car rental place by keeping a big smile on his face was really funny. ""This sign should say 'We have car.' honey!""
The homage to ""Mrs. Robinson"" looking through Goldie Hawns' legs at a sheepish looking Steve Martin took me by surprise as well. And, what more can you say about John Cleese? The man is nothing if not funny in everything he does. He is the anti-Fawlty in this movie, and he has a fairly juicy part as well, so look to him for some great laughs as well. Anyone who has the most recent release of Fawlty Towers on VHS will recognize at least one joke which Cleese himself brought to the movie--note: the scene about the bellboy knocking on the door with the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up, to see if the guest really meant to have the sign up.
This isn't a classic film, but it's MUCH better than people have been saying. A little cheesy, a lot of fun.",972691200,,1261,4.3931623931623935

1045060,4,6305526079,"A movie like this goes a long way to show that experience counts for a lot  in acting business. What would normally have been a  nothing-out-of-the-ordinary funny movie is elevated to unusual height by  the excellent teamplay of the two leads, Martin and Hawn and Cless as the  crossdressing hotel manager. Without ever trying to steal each others show  they each contribute to what must rate as one of the most hiarious movies  ever made.  The story itself, elderly but still youthfull couple has  finally time for each other and they don't really know what to do now is  even preserved throughout the movie and doesn't get lost like it usually  does in comedies. And a continues flow of jokes keeps the pace to the very  end.",958348800,,727,4.645669291338582

1045062,3,6305526079,"Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese. What could be a better cast for a comedic plot? Good question. Yet this film just never quite hits on all eight cylinders.
John Cleese and the running sex gag was pretty pitiful.  He's got the talent to be really and truly funny. He doesn't need to rely  on the sorry schtick (sp?) of being a guy dressed in lady's  undergarments.
Hawn and Martin and the sex counseling scene was just  embarrasing. This, sadly, is NOT a movie for the whole fam.
Yet it does  have many funny moments. Just put the kids out of the room.
The original  movie with Jack Lemmon was hilarious. No inappropos sex jokes, no drag  queens - just good clean fun.

It's not really funny, with a couple chuckles and smiles here and there, and the actors play characters that you can't help but hate.  Steve Martin is, okay, but  I've seen him in funnier roles.  Goldie Hawn's character was showered with  so much stupidity and idiocy that she became annoying and at times,  unbearable.  John Cleese dancing in drag did nothing for me, and it wasn't  funny.  ""The Out of Towners"" is not a terrible movie, I just  didn't really care enough about it to make a real judgement.  My friend  liked it and bought it, so I laughed sometimes for his benefit.  I thought  about how much money he spent on it too, $30 to be exact, and thought that  this movie didn't deserve to have that much money shelled out on it.

I admit, it will probably never win any awards, and maybe it's not one of the  absolute BEST movies Steve Martin and Goldy Hawn have ever been involved  in.  NEVERTHELESS, it delivers 90 minutes of laughs and entertainment as we  watch empty nesters, Harry and Nancy from Ohio,tackle the many aggravations  of BIG BAD NEW YORK CITY!  Their rental car breaks down, they're mugged,  pursued by a vicious Rottweiler, and spied in a ""compromising  position"" by the mayor, himself!  Yes, the movie succumbs to extreme  silliness at times; but on the plus side, it made me laugh and never got  boring!

This film has not yet been released on Blu-ray, anywhere in the world, and clearly I think it should be or I wouldn't have paid to own the HD copy available here. The film quality is a clear and welcome upgrade from the DVD quality. While it is not one of Amazon's full 1080p HD offerings, the HD version upscales on a 1080p television to excellent clarity, slightly under what a Blu-ray would offer. As usual, the streaming is perfect and without interruption or buffering or any of that silliness so it compares to the experience of viewing a Blu-ray, except for the slight down-tick in picture quality. The audio is identical to the DVD release in every respect. If, like me, you just can't wait for a Blu-ray any longer, this is a clear and high quality option for an alternative to the DVD release.
