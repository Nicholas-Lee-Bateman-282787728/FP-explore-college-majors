4123814,5,B003H6KRKC,"Anyone who owns or enjoys Dragonball Z, but is not that big a fan of the original series Dragonball should check this out. This is the season where Goku and Krillin grow up and you get to see the Piccolo you know from DBZ for the first time. The fight between Piccolo and Goku in this season is as good as any fight you'd see in Dragonball Z.

31 episodes/5 discs",1279065600,2,363,4.112676056338028
4123815,5,B003H6KRKC,"After I purchase this set I will have the whole Dragon Ball series from Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT.  I grew up with Dragon Ball Z and never got to see the Dragon Ball series.  I'm 24 now and I still enjoy watching.  So far all the Dragon Ball box sets have been great so this one won't let you down.  Funimation has been releasing and re-releasing DBZ for 8+ years now.  I started out buying the VHS's and then started collecting the single DVD's that came with a box holding case, but never got to finish that collection.  Then I starting collecting the orange sets and finally got every episode and soon I will have all the Blue sets too.  I can't wait for this set and I will give it all thumbs up and suggest every fan of Goku and his friends to purchase it too.

P.S.  The DVD's that came out with 3-4 episodes on them may have been expensive to collect, but I thought they were amazing.  I have the Cell saga from the beginning to the saiyaman saga on those DVD's.  The menus were great, but I guess they went basic to save money and put more episodes per disc (Blue ray releases are inevitable).  It's OK though, as long as I have the episodes I'm good.  Just wanted to throw that thought in there.",1273795200,10,1225,4.183760683760684
4123816,5,B003H6KRKC,"Funimation is still getting these sets out for fans who don't already own the series uncut or fans who may have purchased their old sets but don't mind double dipping for these well done sets that line up so nicely on the shelf, especially alongside the orange Dragon Ball Z season sets. This 5-disc fifth 'season' set of Dragon Ball will contain the final 31 episodes of the series:

123 Lost and Found
124 Temple Above the Clouds
125 Earth's Guardian Emerges
126 Eternal Dragon Resurrected
127 Quicker Than Lightning
128 Secret of the Woods
129 The Time Room
130 Goku's Doll?
131 Walking Their own Ways
132 Hotter Than Lava
133 Changes
134 Preliminary Peril
135 Battle of Eight
136 Tien Shinhan vs Mercenary Tao
137 Anonymous Proposal
138 The Mysterious Hero
139 Rematch
140 Goku Gains Speed
141 The Four Faces of Tien
142 Kami vs Piccolo
143 Battle for the Future
144 Super Kamehameha
145 Junior no More
146 Goku's Trap
147 Goku Hangs On
148 The Victor
149 Dress in Flames
150 The Fire-Eater
151 Outrageous Octagon
152 Mystery Of The Dark World
153 The End, The Beginning

All these episodes are presented in remastered editions of their original full frame (4:3 Aspect Ratio) format. Audio has English or Japanese voice track options and the original Japanese musical score in 5.1 Surround. As is standard with these sets there will be no special features other than previews for other Funimation products and textless songs, so don't expect to find any here.

These episodes contain many classic Dragon Ball moments. Goku and his friends will face a greater threat in the form of Piccolo Jr, the one we all know from DBZ, and thus Goku will recieve some special training from someone who will become a DBZ permanent fixture. Training his friends will later go through in preparation to fight the Saiyans in DBZ. Everyone will grow a bit older and become young adults, but poor Krillin won't grow much taller. A jaded friend from Goku's past will return to settle a score and make a proclamation and all of this happens at another World Martial Arts Tournament. Which is the final World Martial Arts Tournament in the Dragon Ball storyline and actually the final one for quite some time even in the Dragon Ball Z storyline. The showdown between Goku and Piccolo Jr. takes place and there is something poetic about Goku showing his greatest villain thus far mercy in the end only for him to later in DBZ become one of his closest allies. Even for those who know the outcome the fight is still worth seeing and promises a truly explosive ending.

Finally when all is said and done there are some filler episodes regarding a wedding and one final quest before it can get underway. Goku must face old demons before moving on to his future, a future that you'll have to watch DBZ to see, or to see again for those who already have. Leading to Dragon Ball Z these episodes have more focus on the fighting and showdowns than on the actual dragon ball's themselves but they still have all the interpersonal relationships and fun characters that make Dragon Ball so successful and enjoyable. The final set is a great way to bring a close to the Dragon Ball story and bring us right back to where Dragon Ball Z begins, which is the spot most of us first came to know these wonderful characters in the first place. Thanks for your time.",1272240000,93,3329,4.618243243243243

When i came across Dragon Ball i instantly fell in love with this anime. Now I purchased seasons 1-5 to have all the episodes as part of my collection. I really like the booklet the DVD'S are inserted in and the slip cover is very nice as well. The audio is really good. I definitely recommend Dragon Ball to anyone whether you are new to anime or not. I've got to say this is a great gateway in order to get into other anime's. Great blend of action and comedy. Now go out and search for those DRAGON BALLS!!!",1487635200,5,640,4.087301587301587

No booklet for the episodes but with kanzenshuu.com's episode lists, it really didn't matter that much. It your a fan of the original Japanese version, heads up as the episodes titles are in still in English even when you change it to the original Japanese language track. This was not the case on the early 2000s volumes nor any DBZ DVDs I own. I guess because of the remastering? It's highly recommended you watch these on a Blu-ray player to get the best picture. The remastering added sort of a upscaling and masking to the grain and imperfections of the original 16mm film and add the Blu-ray upscaling and you forget you're watching something that was made in the late 1980s. This DVD set includes episodes 123-153. This corresponds to the Piccolo Jr. DVDs (Vol 9.1-9.2) from the early 2000s. Story arcs are: Heavenly Training, 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai and the completely filler Wedding Dress arc.

and if your buying them for yourself that's great too this is the #1 anime and a lot of people over 18yrs of age are obsessed with it. ive bought all the seasons and watched them atleast 5 times through in the past 3 years and they still work fine.

the only problems that I have had are I didn't get the booklet for seasons 1 and 2 but you won't need them anyways and the other problem I have encountered is that the part that holds the discs a few of them have been broken and the disc will fall out of place at random which may lead to me dropping it on a hard floor or misplacing it but other then those its perfect.",1419033600,,833,4.0120481927710845

Dragon Balls!

But even if Goku succeeds in raising the dead, there's no guarantee
he'll live long enough to enjoy a reunion with his slain comrades. The
World Martial Arts Tournament is just around the corner, and an
eerily-familiar foe known only as Junior wants to teach Goku the true
meaning of pain! To survive the tournament and finally earn the title
of World's Greatest Martial Artist, Goku must train his mind as well
as his body to complete his amazing transformation from a
bushy-tailed boy into a man to be reckoned with!",1396483200,,865,4.574193548387097

4123961,5,B003H6KRKC,Goku finally arrives all grown up and this is when the series actually turns almost in to what DBZ was an adrenaline action packed series with the best characters in anime history. It shows the beginning of goku and piccolo rivalry even though it was a short rivalry considering thy goku and vegeta was a better rivalry.

4123964,5,B003H6KRKC,The true beginning of dragonball z. If you the think the other seasons of dragonball are boring this is definately not. And if you're a fan of dbz and don't understand some of the story line watching all five seasons of dragonball would make it all clear,1381622400,,254,4.425531914893617
4123965,4,B003H6KRKC,"We have some fantastic story-lines in the final chapters of Dragon Ball, including Goku's training with Kami and the showdown with Ma-Junior.  But like the rest of the series, these episodes are full of useless filler produced by the anime studio while Akira Toriyama was writing and illustrating new editions of the concurrent manga.  Presentation-wise, Funimation has done a fabulous job of restoring the visuals and audio for the English dub, and for purists an original Japanese audio track is intact, along with excellent subtitles that remain true to the original script.  I highly recommend watching both versions -- first the English, so you can follow the action; then the Japanese, so you get all the original (and often adult-oriented) jokes and plot points.",1378771200,,769,5.185483870967742

The quality of the DVD and box are great, the episodes are a fitting conclusion to the first third of Goku's story. I have really only two complaints and they are somewhat petty. While I respect Funimation for trying to cut down on packing materials, I was a bit disappointed to find that they no longer include the episode guide / character description insert that came in previous seasons. They have made it available for download online, but its just not the same. Also, its a shame that they did not include the panoramic picture on the outside of the slip cases. You have to take all the seasons out of there cases to get them to make the picture. Anyway, small complaints aside, I do recommend these sets to fans of the show.",1359849600,,849,4.414012738853503

4124005,5,B003H6KRKC,I have seen Dragon Ball Z on cartoon network when it was airing many years ago and Loved it but never saw Dragon Ball. Seeing it for the first time is really awesome. If you like Dragon Ball Z you will enjoy Dragon ball this is how it all got started. Highly Recommend.,1337731200,,269,4.09433962264151
4124006,5,B003H6KRKC,I love Dragon Ball Season 5. It bothers me that it jumps three years into the future. Goku was training in the Upper World and then it skips to the tournament. This is the last season of Dragon Ball.,1336694400,,199,4.128205128205129
4124007,5,B003H6KRKC,"Now I know a lot of people hate me for this but I personally think that Dragon Ball, not Z, but Dragon Ball is the greatest anime. I'm still stuck between this and Naruto, but the original Dragon Ball story, is just so original, completely laugh out loud hilarious and very inspiring. I've always loved Akira Toriyama's art style, he's kind of altered it in Z but what never ceases to amaze me is the creativity. Who would have ever thought of making a Japanese anime with anthropomorphic animals and mainly chibi characters. I've watched the series countless times and I still LOVE it and it keeps me entertained. Even the fillers are great.

Now moving on to the actual boxed set, as you know this is the last season of Dragon Ball. The 1st disc and half of the 2nd disc are the last we see of chibi Goku (Shockingly 15 years old though). In the previous season Goku fought the evil King Piccolo after he killed his closest friends. The King Piccolo saga was the turning point of the Dragon Ball franchise and becomes more known for it's action. In this season Goku prepares and trains with Kami, the earth's guardian for 3 years to fight Piccolo Jr. (King Piccolo's reincarnation) with some filler but still great, and restores the life of his friends with the dragon balls. There are some heated battles and also the final battle between Goku and Jr. After a brutal match between the two warriors Goku embarks on a journey with his life-long friend and future wife Chi-chi to rescue her father from a burning castle (which is another filler). What I found weird though is that I ordered this brand new but for some reason didn't get a booklet included as the previous 4 did. Overall this is a great season and would without a doubt recommend this to anyone.",1335830400,,1761,4.537735849056604
4124008,5,B003H6KRKC,"Talk about epic, DragonBall is straight to the point and has more meaningful and significant battles than Z does as a whole. The whole Piccolo fight is not trounced by any fight in Z. Only Vegeta and Frieza come close.",1331683200,,218,4.475
4124009,5,B003H6KRKC,"My son had all but Season 5 of Dragon Ball and really wanted it for Christmas.
He was so excited to get it, and I really appreciated the prompt receipt and condition of this item. Thank you so much.",1325376000,,198,4.102564102564102
4124010,5,B003H6KRKC,The final season of Dragon Ball!  A must have to finish with the Dragon Ball collection! I cannot wait to start this season to go right next into dragonball z .,1324425600,,160,4.161290322580645
4124011,5,B003H6KRKC,This was a great purchase. It came very quickly and was exactly as I had imagined. It has helped me come closer to completing my collection.,1323129600,,140,4.423076923076923
4124012,5,B003H6KRKC,"I was happy  when I saw this go down in price so I ordered it. It said the package would arrive between Dec. 5th-12th... I got it Dec. 2nd : ) It was packaged very sturdily and all the discs are scratch-free. I ordered this along with Season 4 which is also in mint condition with scratch free discs : ) I am very happy with the overall experience. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some Dragon Ball to watch : )",1322784000,,410,3.9397590361445785
4124013,3,B003H6KRKC,"THREE OF THE FIVE DISCS DID NOT WORK. I looked on the back of them and they looked like they burned incorrectly. I got a weird message saying that the codec was different. I am a bit angered because it was a new set from Amazon.com.

UPDATE: Amazon has since replaced the DVDs in the set, and they work perfectly. I think that Season 5 of Dragon Ball was by far the best season of the entire show, if not the entire series. I would have given 5 stars if the set was not defective.",1310428800,2,480,4.052631578947368
4124014,4,B003H6KRKC,It is good to complete the saga. But you will probably only watch it once or twice. So buy it cheap or rent it.,1308355200,,111,3.6666666666666665
4124015,5,B003H6KRKC,"I have read the entire manga, and seen/own all of dragon ball z and dragon ball gt. But i have never seen dragon ball. I knew what it was about from the manga but still wanted to see the anime. this gave me a chance without having to spend a fortune.",1307145600,,250,3.9215686274509802
4124016,5,B003H6KRKC,A brilliant ending to a brilliant series. Yes it was sad to see the series end after only five seasons. I had never watched all of Dragonball before buying all the seasons on DVD because Dragonball came out after DBZ in the US and I was more interested in DBZ at the time. Dragonball is an excellent series though and it only gets better as it goes due to Toriyama realistic style of making characters get older and naturally develop throughout the series. It is also a great series for kids and is sold at a reasonable and affordable price.,1305072000,,541,4.42
4124020,5,B003H6KRKC,"This is the final season of dragonball, and it goes out with a bang. But fear not for DBZ picks up a few years later and will fill any yearning for this series.",1301011200,,160,3.878787878787879
4124021,3,B003H6KRKC,"The Dragon Ball Season Five DVD box set includes five DVDs that contain thirty-one episodes.  The first four discs contain seven episodes, while the fifth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The emphasis on this set is Goku's training with Kami and Mister Popo to prepare for the next Tenkaichi Tournament, the actual Tenkaichi Tournament, and Goku and Chichi's attempt to save the Ox King and his castle after the castle ends up catching on fire.

On the main menu of the first four discs, you can choose to watch all the episodes, watch the disc with the marathon feature, choose which episode you want to watch, and set up your language and subtitle options.  One of the best features of this set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  In the setup menu, you can choose between English and Japanese audio.  You can also choose to turn the subtitles on and off.

The menu on the fifth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  However, the features aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which are the same as what appeared on the first four DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for D.Gray-man, Mushi-Shi, The Slayers, Black Cat, Soul Eater, and S.A.V.E.

Overall, the episodes on this disc are rather enjoyable.  The final few episodes wrap up the series nicely, and work perfectly to set the stage for the next series, Dragon Ball Z.  However, I was disappointed that FUNimation still insisted on splitting the episodes between the discs in an odd fashion.  It would have been nice if more of an effort had been made to split the episodes a little more evenly between the discs, especially since there's so little in the way of bonus features.

While I'm a little disappointed by the episode breakdown of the discs and by the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball fans that want to own the series on DVD.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1300147200,,2225,4.592405063291139
4124022,5,B003H6KRKC,I have all five now.  Well worth the money and my son loves them.  I tried the bargain site where you get all 176 videos for less than a $100 and I was hugely dissapointed.  These are collector quality and I'm sure my son as well as future generations will get to enjoy them.,1298419200,,275,4.055555555555555
4124023,5,B003H6KRKC,"Ok, I know that a lot of people like DragonBall Z better but there missing were it all began.  This is where it began at the end of this series and might I say I'v enjoyed it.  I know it doesnt have as much action in it as dragonball Z does but it very hilarious and actually has a incredible story line with extrodinary characters.  Probably one of the best series in anime history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1294704000,6,396,4.324324324324325
4124024,5,B003H6KRKC,"After the defeat of King Piccolo, Goku is still determined to get stronger. Now that evil has been vanquished he has one thing on his mind...to become the World Tournament Champion. After finding the most intense training possible he reunites with his friends...as a fully grown man. The tournament is going to be a challenge unlike any other because there is a mysterious yet familiar face signed up to fight and a strange girl that is furious because he never kept a promise he made long ago. It really does take a lot to be the best.

Now my journey is complete and I am so happy that I have now seen the whole phenomenal story of Dragon Ball. This season is a lot less intense, yet with some very tense moments. It was so great to finally see these characters become young men and women, even though I am so use to them being older it was nice to finally see them grow up and make important choices in their lives. The tournament was probably some of the most intense action I have seen since the Kid Buu saga, and the final showdown between Goku and Piccolo is incredible. The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is now seeing Piccolo in the series entirety, it is crazy that in the end he was not as strong as he was in Dragon Ball. The again looking at the Z and GT adversaries, it does make sense. I intend to spend many hours of many days watching the whole story strait through as soon as I get all 4 of the Dragon Ball movies. I really liked how the last few episodes really took Goku to the next step in his life, by giving him an adventure with Chi Chi.

I have to say that as action packed as Dragon Ball Z is, Dragon Ball is now my favorite, just because the premise is so much more down to earth and light hearted. Besides, who doesn't love a great origin story?

IF YOU HAVE READ ALL MY REVIEWS ON DRAGON BALL, DRAGON BALL Z & DRAGON BALL GT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!",1292457600,19,1885,4.18732782369146
4124025,5,B003H6KRKC,This collection contains the final episodes of the first Dragonball series. I do not want to spoil anything so i will say only this.... DO NOT MISS IT!,1287705600,,151,4.428571428571429
4124026,5,B003H6KRKC,"This season represents the last saga from Dragonball. The Piccolo Junior saga takes place right after the King Piccolo saga in the previous season. Here we see Piccolo's egg hatch and we see a little green Namek (although Piccolo's race isn't properly explained until the Sayian saga in DBZ) inside and we see for the first time why Piccolo is the enemy.

We also learn about the origins of Goku's Power Pole and that it's soul purpose is to go from the roof of Korin Tower and extend up to the bottom of the Lookout, so the person can meet with Kami and Mr Popo.
Also, this is where the Lookout is first shown and we find out how hard it is to go up there and be granted an audience with the Guardian of Earth. Whereas in DBZ, the rule is very relaxed and any Z Fighter can fly up to the Lookout without needing to get permission from Korin.

Seeing Mr Popo for the first time and not including the times during DBZ and GT, he has a very calm and somewhat strict personality, if he thinks you're wasting his or Kami's time he will send you home at the drop of a hat. What most people don't see in the entire series is that Mr Popo can fight. When Kami finally appears, Goku naturally reacts after seeing Kami's face. As it reminds him of King Piccolo before he got eternal youth. Kami and Mr Popo are very nice, polite and very patient people and ones you shouldn't take advantage of because of their friendly, easy going personality.

The training that Mr Popo gives Goku will help his fighting skills, which he will have to rely on for the rest of the series. But for a moment I didn't think Goku would make it because he relies on his eyes and not his senses. But Goku somehow learnt all of these things off screen before the tournament.

Goku sees an old foe at the tournament, which gives everyone a cause for concern. Tien will face off against his former teacher in his new cyborg body. But one thing I would have liked to see is Tao explaining in a flashback about how he survived the explosion and who constructed his body. But the match between Tao and Tien was great! Tao put up a good fight; showcasing the many things he can do in his cybernetic body.

When Krillin fought Junior, although Krillin didn't win officially but he did win everyone's heart and respect in the way he fought in that match. Krillin even manages to shock Junior at the very end.

We now know how Tien got the scar on his chest from Tao's hidden knife but we don't know how Yamcha got the scars on his face. He arrived at the tournament with the scars on his face, so if must have happened during the 3-year gap which Tien, Yamcha, Krillin and Chiaotzu spent training.

Yamcha demonstrates his new technique against Hero, the Spirit Ball attack.
Tien fights an all out war against Goku in the semi-finals. Tien also demonstrates a new move called `Quadruplication', which then changes to `Multi-form' later in the series. Goku removes his weighted training clothes and shows everyone just how fast he is without them.
Hero (Kami) shows just how fierce he can be when he performs the `Evil Containment Wave' and attempts to trap Junior into a tiny bottle but fails when Junior sends the attack right back at Hero.

The final match between Goku and Junior is probably one of the best in the series. A reason why Goku didn't forfeit the match for his own safety is probably that he was the Runner-Up in the previous two tournaments and Goku doesn't want to make it a third. However, Goku and Junior's fight was bloodthirsty and violent especially when Junior rips off his own arm, shoots a beam through Goku's chest, stamps on it and hits Goku's wound. The final match isn't a normal tournament match, it is like Goku and Junior are fighting an epic battle but in the constraints of a tournament ring. Junior makes his body bigger into a giant, just like another Namek, Lord Slug. Goku shows us that fighting a giant Namek is no trouble for him. He evens fights Junior inside his body and launching a Kamehameha from his feet.

Junior acts more evil and is full of hate and malice than his father but I'd say his father did more evil acts on humanity than his son. I was surprised when Junior came to the tournament that no one except Goku and his friends saw that he looks like King Piccolo. Having green skin isn't a common sight among people and it was only 3 years ago when King Piccolo first appeared to the world. It's not something you likely forget.

When Ox-King's kingdom goes up in flames, I was wondering why Goku left him in his castle when the flames were getting too close for comfort. Goku should have rescued him and then went on his mission to find the bansho fan.
The old lady, Octagon, she teaches Chi Chi everything about being a good housewife, which she uses throughout the rest of the series.
We also see the gateway to Other world and see Goku's deceased grandfather, Gohan.

Goku and Chi Chi's wedding was a bit too short for me. They could have made it longer by having all of Goku's friends come along and make it more of an occasion rather than having Ox-King, Goku and Chi Chi on a blanket with food and with all of the villagers in front of them. The amount of food they had was enough for a small picnic.

In the booklet, there should have been Krillin and Yamcha in the Hero section.
Looking back at the characters that have appeared on the front covers of Dragonball I would have made a few changes. I am happy with leaving kid Goku on Season 1, Krillin didn't play a huge part but I would have still put him on Season 2, just as a thanks for all the future things he has done throughout the series, with Season 3 I would have like Yamcha on the front since this season box set is where he is trained by Master Roshi but I can sort of live with Roshi on the front cover, I would have put Tien on Season 4 and for Season 5 I would have put Piccolo, although it is adult Goku on the front. This doesn't mean he gets to be on all of the covers just because he is the main protagonist.

But all in all, a great season and the best way to end off the first series is with a wedding.

The story now continues into Dragonball Z.....",1285977600,8,6144,4.331304347826087

8396786,3,B003H6KRKC,"The story on Kami's lookout is almost insufferable. It drags on forever, the pace is slow, and it feels like filler even though it's not. If it weren't for the Piccolo Jr tournament taking up the middle, this season wouldn't be watchable. But, man. That middle...

For a tournament arc, there's a lot of surprises and plot development. You finally see Goku and his friends as adults, looking much more like their DBZ characters. It's exciting, you see character growth (both physically and plot wise), and get some twists and surprises.

Then the last third is the wedding dress filler. There's nothing glaringly wrong with it. It just seems outta place in the series. It's filler, so that's not surprising. And the writing seems like everything is a bit forced. Pilaf's in it, so at least there's that.

This season is mediocre at best, and straight up terrible in some places.",1519948800,,878,4.801324503311259
