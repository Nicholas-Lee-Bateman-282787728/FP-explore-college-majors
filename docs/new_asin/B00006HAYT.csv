1759500,3,B00006HAYT,"For a B- type movie this is a fairly decent one. It does have a story line. The acting is not too bad and it IS a bit spooky. The end did catch me unprepared! It reminds me a lot of Dark World with Michael Pare` which had a ending that totally caught me off guard. Of the two, I would rather watch Dark World but as I said. Alike.

1759502,3,B00006HAYT,"Uwe Boll. Let me repeat the name again: Uwe Boll. Ever heard of him? You will soon if you haven't yet because this German chap is quickly racking up a filmography that many moviegoers compare to the legendary Ed Wood of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Glen or Glenda"" fame. The mere mention of this ""filmmaker"" sends shivers down the spines of any self-respecting horror film fans. When spoken aloud, the name has an effect not unlike holy water tossed on a vampire. Those of us familiar with his oeuvre--the screeching banality that bears the name ""House of the Dead,"" the airbag deploying atrocity that is ""Alone In the Dark,"" the war crime called ""Bloodrayne""--cannot long endure the idea that Uwe Boll will continue to make horror movies. We can't. We would rather shove bamboo shoots soaked in iodine under our own fingernails than see another Boll theatrical release. When I rented ""Blackwoods"" and discovered our man of the hour directed it, I lost all control over my faculties and instantaneously assumed a fetal position that, oddly enough, lasted for over seven hours. Then I watched the movie. I expected an experience akin to an overdose of cough syrup. I was, incredibly enough, wrong.

""Blackwoods"" stars Patrick Muldoon as Matt Sullivan, an arrogant cad who heads off with his girlfriend Dawn (Keegan Connor Tracy) to some godforsaken backwoods town in order to meet her family. It's all rather mundane stuff here at the beginning, aside from a few disturbing flashbacks where we learn about Matt's involvement in a drunken car accident that took the life of a girl. We see Matt and Dawn stop off at a diner for food, watch as Dawn hides in the backseat of the car when Sheriff William Harding (Michael Pare in a ""strictly for the paycheck"" role) pulls the two over for a minor infraction. Why does Dawn hide from the cop? Why does Harding act strangely when he sees Matt? Why, when our two lovebirds check into a hotel for a romp in the sack, does Dawn seemingly disappear into thin air? What happened to her? Does her disappearance have something to do with the axe-wielding stranger who breaks into the hotel room? Maybe the metaphysically weird motel manager, Greg (Clint Howard), knows more than he's letting on? So many questions to keep us watching! One thing's for certain: Matt's sense of confusion keeps pace with the expanding strangeness of his circumstances.

Unfortunately for Monsieur Sullivan, events take a turn for the worse when he finally meets up with Dawn's family. The Franklin clan--led by Pa (Matthew Walker), Ma (Janet Wright), and their two sons Jack (Sean Campbell) and John (Ben Derrick)--appear to have a serious beef with Matt. Why, you ask? Well, it's got something to do with all those pesky questions I posed above. It's also got something to do with those nagging flashbacks involving that traffic fatality a few years previous. Let's just say the Franklin family blames our hero for a tragic loss, one that these backwoods folks plan on avenging in a most gruesome manner. Before he knows it, Matt Sullivan is racing through the woods trying to stay one step ahead of Jack and John. His very life depends on him keeping his cool. Sadly, maintaining his composure proves impossible as director Boll finally draws back the curtain and reveals the full details of the plot. It seems that accident had a greater effect on Matt than we previously thought, enough of an effect to blur the very line between reality and insanity. Yep, ""Blackwoods"" is one of those twisty-turny flicks that try to mess with our minds by questioning what we think we know all the way to the shocking end.

The film isn't bad at all considering it's an Uwe Boll production. Sure, the budget is low. And the terror that unleashed ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" on the world tries to mix things up by relying heavily on the all too annoying MTV style stop-motion effects that have been done to death over the past few years. Throw in some mighty thin acting and a lack of gory carnage and you'd think ""Blackwoods"" wouldn't be worth a gob of spit. I could go that way, could label the movie a forgettable piece of schmaltz since it's amazingly easy to bash anything carrying the Uwe Boll imprimatur, but I don't really want to. I sort of liked the movie--enough to give it a solid three stars, and that's saying something for a number from a guy who thought casting Tara Reid as an anthropologist was a good idea. Call me a sucker for reality-bending films. More likely, I appreciated the fact that Herr Uwe allows Clint Howard to give full vent to his talent for creating genuinely weird and creepy characters. Greg is a truly warped creature, yet provides most of the film's memorable moments. Too bad casting Clint in ""House of the Dead"" didn't work as well.

Hey, look at all the extras! There aren't any! No trailers, no commentary tracks, no behind the scenes face to face with the cast and crew, no interviews with anyone even remotely involved with the creation of this low budget film. The disc doesn't even contain a stills gallery or biographies. The absence of any supplements usually means one of two things in the world of DVD: the picture you're watching is public domain (I've seen a lot of spaghetti westerns this way) or the movie in question stinks to high heaven. Neither seems to be the case here, although opinions may vary on the latter point. Anyway, I must remember this film the next time I'm watching one of Boll's clunkers. He is, apparently and amazingly, capable of crafting something that doesn't make me feel like slipping into a coma. Imagine that!",1157068800,4,5615,4.720693170234455
1759503,4,B00006HAYT,"I saw this movie on cable and I really liked it. I bought this dvd brand new and it was defective. I sent it back to the online retailer that I bought it from and received a new copy. The same thing happened. It was defective. My Sony home player and my Sony players in my computer gagged on it and inevitably said that the discs need cleaning (the discs were clean but, also defective). I even tried them on a cheaper Magnavox player. I made it to the first scene with the trusty old Magnavox. But, then I lost picture and sound. Buy the slightly more expensive version of this dvd. It can't possibly be more defective.",1088467200,7,620,4.262711864406779
1759504,4,B00006HAYT,"I truly expected this movie to be the very definition of a ""B"" movie with a mediocre cast and shoddy dialog.  Surprisingly the movie was a moderately good thrill ride full of twists and turns which leaves you shocked and appreciative of the thought put into the ending.  I liked it alot.",1078876800,2,287,4.5
1759505,4,B00006HAYT,"Patrick Muldoon sure would be a household name if everyone watched the countless straight to videos this man has made.  Muldoon possesses a swarmy sexuality, and a boy next door demeanor that has placed him in several heroic type roles.  In ""Blackwoods"" however, Muldoon is cast in a role in which his character can be questioned.  Director Uwe Boll uses kinetic flashbacks to illustrate this story of a man who is held hostage by a strange backwoods family, who hold him responsible for the death of their youngest daughter.  Muldoon struck and killed her with his car.  The family believes he was drunk when he did it and didn't get the justice they feel he deserved.  So they decide to exact their revenge?
Or wait a minute...did it happen the way Muldoon remembers?
This is an intriguing, enigmatic tale where nothing is as it seems.  Muldoon does a great job, with some good support from Michael Pare, Will Sanderson and zany Clint Howard.
The ending is a surprise, even though you should see it coming!
Still, quite different for Muldoon and worthwhile.",1075248000,10,1059,4.785714285714286
1759506,1,B00006HAYT,"I wish I could review the film itself, because it looked very promising.  Unfortunately, it isn't possible because the two copies I screened were defective.  Some players refused to track beyond chapter 7, others, the last 2 chapters, 19 & 20. In every case, the picture froze and broke up, making complete viewing of the film impossible.  The original, more expensive release of this DVD by Velocity Home Entertainment has been reviewed on this site without technical complaints, so I'm ordering that one instead.  Meanwhile, Platinum needs to take this botched budget pressing off the market.",1073347200,10,594,5.15625
1759507,4,B00006HAYT,"Matt (Patrick Muldoon) takes his girlfriend to the backwoods.  Along the way, Matt has flashbacks of his past.  He's been in this part of the backwoods before.  First they are pulled over by the Sheriff (Michael Pare), who thinks he knows Matt somehow before.  Then they reach a motel with a seedy hotel manager (Clint Howard) who only rents rooms with porno television to couples.  After some pleasure, Matt falls asleep and has a nightmare of his past.  Suddenly he is awaken by an ax-carrying man at the door.  After telling and showing the lazy hotel manager what just happened, alone in the room now, he goes a little crazy for a while.  So scared.  So frustrated.  Later he takes a walk in the backwoods and come across a house.

1759533,1,B00006HAYT,"This movie is so bad.  SO bad.  For some reason its dubbed like it was made for cable but no one would buy it so they had to put it on Fox.  When I say dubbed, I mean in that absurd way where every F bomb is instead some strange F word no one uses or there is no sound at all despite the actors lips still moving.  This movie is NR so the point of that is unclear.  The female lead is so obnoxious I was praying she would get murdered in the first 5 minutes of the movie.  The constant flashback scenes are annoying and break up any flow the movie might have had.  I feel like I have tackled some huge feat by finishing this movie.",1421712000,,631,3.8449612403100777

1759535,4,B00006HAYT,"OMG it turned out to be a crazy movie about hillbillies and moonshiner types. Accccck! There are no supernatural or occult elements in this movie, however, the setting is a combination of dark woods and long dark (very dark) seemingly endless wooded roads; this particular graphic recipe plays easily to a personal and completely irrational phobia of mine, so that made up for the lack of ill tempered spirits and shadowy threats from the great beyond. Perhaps it's an urban thing or too much Rod Serling.

Anyhow, it's quite a good movie featuring numerous very clever plot twists and good old fashioned solid script.
The editing must have been very tricky but he/she pulled it off nicely so the many flashbacks which could easily have muddied the waters, were pulled together into coherent sequences that were vital to the overall telling of this dark little story of human failings and revenge.",1419638400,2,897,4.940397350993377

1759538,1,B00006HAYT,".  The protagonist is a ""Rob Lowe"" look-a-like, and a worse actor.  HIs girlfriend is the most annoying type of woman and cannot act either.  The motel manager is that weird guy who played an alien on the old Star Trek tv series. Even though he has zero talent, he keeps popping up in bit parts in films and tv, so I guess he has lots of friends in low places in Hollywood.

1759539,3,B00006HAYT,This is not a HORROR film. It's more like a suspense thriller. It was not bad at all and the twist ending certainly added to the film. I just don't think it's in the right category. Three stars!,1396656000,,194,4.131578947368421
1759540,3,B00006HAYT,"I would say this was OK, and not more.

The wailing Black female music didn't seem to fit here, and was too loud, I had to keep turning her song-overs down.

The plot of the movie was different. And so many other commenters made mention of the unusual twist ending. The ending was different, but not not watch-again different.

Clint Howard, who always seems to play the oddball in horror movies, had a small part in this movie. Not outstanding. Just typical oddball Clint Howard. The other acting was fair, and watchable,...but that damn wailing music, was annoying.

If you can buy this movie for under 9 bucks, that's a fair price.",1385164800,,634,4.633928571428571

After sex Dawn goes for a walk and while she's gone, a man with an ax breaks into the motel room and tries to kill Matt. Neither the motel owner nor the local sherriff believs him. Dawn is still missing so Matt goes to look for her.

The story is pretty good and Blackwoods could have been a good movie. But it suffers from way too many flashback sequences. The story jumps back and forth in time and it's not until about halfway into the movie that they start to make any sense; before that they're just confusing and annoying and distract from enjoying the story. Clint Howard is funny as the motel owner but the rest of the cast is pretty weak. All in all not a bad film but it cold have been better. Weak 3 star rating.",1259280000,2,849,4.208588957055214
