Yes, yes, we must hurry and save the mummies before the government tears up the area and destroy all the mummies. Got that. I'm sorry but this was more snoozefest than informative. If you are having trouble sleeping, this might be just what you've been looking for.",1433721600,,348,4.5396825396825395
7958133,5,B000062XO1,"This documentary is extremely riveting, both because of the rich depth of knowledge it contains and also because of the use of vibrance and acting to enhance viewers' understanding of the Inca civilization.
This documentary spans the near 100-year-rule of the Inca Empire, before it was diminished by the Spaniards and the diseases they brought from Europe in 60 minutes.
My favorite aspect of the film was that it also takes into account the fact that the Inca history is still being lived out today through ancestors of the Inca Empire living in Peru.  It also exhibited the race for time that is going on throughout the world at ancient burial/civilization sites due to the new technology being implemented.  Machinery has already ruined many artifacts and treasures from the Inca Empire in Peru, and this is true of other ancient civilizations' remains in other areas of the world.  While this is tragic, it also raises the viewers' awareness and hopefully prompts them to take action to preserve such beauty and history.
I often found, in my studies of world history, that the civilizations of the Americas before the rise of the United States were the most difficult to study, due to their sheer complexity of culture and religion. I especially found it difficult to distinguish between the Inca and the Aztec, as I would confuse their rituals and main rulers.  With the help of PBS and National Geographic, though, I now feel I have a much better understanding of the two civilizations and their peoples and cultures.
This documentary fused all aspects of Incan life into one rich, explanatory film that was as enjoyable as it was educational.
I would recommend it to teachers, students, and individual adults and children interested in learning more about the rich, treasure-filled history and culture of the Incas and their ancestors in beautiful Peru today.",1081728000,5,1867,4.993569131832797
