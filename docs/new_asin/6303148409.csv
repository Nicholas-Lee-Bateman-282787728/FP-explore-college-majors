580561,5,6303148409,"This is an excellent movie and a great sequel to an amazing trilogy of blood & gore soaked mayhem. Night of the Demons 2 takes place several years after the first film took place and the initial killings started. Things start out in a catholic group home with several girls & guys who all have the hots for each other and  they all like to mess with this 1 girl who happens to be Angela's sister Melissa. The girls want to have some fun and they decide to take the sister to the abandoned mansion with some fellow friends from the school,but they trick the kids into believing that they are going to a different place but intentionally take all of them to Hull house(where Melissa's sister was taken & posessed) and scare the h*ll out of them by pranking the others into believing that they will kill Melissa as a sacrifice. Turns out that the girl in charge of the prank doesn't realize they have crossed into the realm of the unimaginable. The 1 girl grabs a tube of lipstick and takes it from the house as they get freaked out and split,crossing the underground stream and letting the evil gain it's power. The girl takes the lipstick back to the orphanage and then the girl unleashes the evil & it takes the possesion of her. Angela is now at the orphanage and all h*ll is about to break loose,she takes control and chaos ensues. There is a nun there are some serious holy wars she is fighting,she has a way about her that is comedic and funny. So they take a trip back to Hull house because Melissa got tricked by Angela to go back to the house. So the nun and the priest and a few kids go to the Hull house to get Melissa back. The story is really back and forth and too much to explain but trust me this ends in a bloody mess. There is alot more going on here than in the first movie there is alot of gore,more than the first movie. Lots of humor and alot of styleized violence,the priest believes there is no  such thing as demons(yet he is a priest speaking the word of god?) So he goes and gets himself killed and they all get infected by the evil and it is up to the nun,Melissa and a very courageous young man who is trying to protect his girlfriend BB(the girl who took the lipstick) and they eventually get too see the real evil that is Angela holds. Melissa is forced to face her demons and kill her ""sister"" once and for all. This movie really has alot going on,alot of plot twists and turns,their is alot of blood and violence. Trust me if you are a fan of the original or even saw the remake take my word for it this is an excellent movie. It is alot more unique than part 1 but this is an instant classic,trust me you will absolutely love it. The movie is insane there is alot more special effects and crazy creature action. Way more out there than the first,but it all tells a story and it continues into part 3(which was not that great but still ok) The film is great,you cannot call yourself a horror film fan and not own these 3 movies,4 if you count the remake. You can't go wrong.",1427414400,5,3005,4.2334494773519165

580563,4,6303148409,"Depending on who you ask, many people are going to tell you that Night of the Demons 2 kind of falls short of the original, but Im here to tell you it actually holds up and could be a worthy sequel to the original. There are not a lot of horror movies with female antagonists, and Angela Franklin of the NOTD films is probably the only one who can actually out-creep Angela Johnson of the Sleepaway Camp movies. However, shes not quite up there with the female antagonists of The Grudge or The Ring. While not a sequel per say, the movie does pick up several years after the first movie around Angelas sister, Melissa, who is living in a Catholic school and is not well liked by her roommates because her recurring nightmares. Unfortunately, instead of focusing the movie on her, the film instead centers on students played by Johnny Moran, Rick Peters, pre-Brady Bunch Christine Taylor, Zoe Trilling and Bobby Jacoby. Trilling is basically the star of the movie, stealing every scene she appears in as bad girl Shirley Fenardi, echoing the way Amelia Kinkade stole the movie out from under Linnea Quigley in the first movie. Actors Rod McCary and Jennifer Rhodes round out the cast as the only adults in the movie, but the plot does a remarkable thing with their characters. In the start, McCary is the only rational person and very likable as he keeps things normal, but Rhodes is instead annoying with her puritanical and old-fashioned ways as she disciplines the students in the school. However, their characters become reversed as the students help Angela escape Hull House, reach the school and set off supernatural events in order to spirit away her sister. McCary then becomes annoyingly logical and blind to the truth of the demonic activity as Rhodes becomes the most fun character in the movie, a kick-ass nun wielding rosary beads, a yardstick and a water gun filled with Holy Water to combat Angela. At one point, her religious faith is so strong that she returns to life even after Angela decapitates her. While the movie lacks the darker creepier atmosphere of the first movie, there are a lot of truly creative scenes, like a headless student playing basketball with his head and Zoes breasts turning into hands and attacking her boyfriend. Theres also an over-reliance on latex masks, excessive nudity and obscenity and too much footage reused from the first movie which makes the movie look much more campy and cheaper than the original. The acting by the cast is very good, but the script doesnt really give the majority of the actors except Rhodes and Trilling much to do. It even adds on another secondary pointless ending with Angela as a giant serpent monster that isn't scary or compelling. Overall, its a very fun movie for pure horror fans or even the gore fanatics who prefer less atmosphere and plot and instead prefer buckets of blood and violence.",1426032000,,2877,4.767535070140281

They are fun and creepy and have some very memorable scenes and lines that can be quoted and any horror fan will know exactly what you are quoting and bam! Friendships are made and drinks are shared..Night of the Demons 2 I have to say surprised me. Although my girl Linnea Quigley is not in it which made me sad I made peace with this fact. The movie tends to go for a more comic edge but it works! It keeps true to the story of Hull House and the spirit of Night of the Demons and more and also gives new meaning to the phrase ""killer boobies""..watch the movie . put it on at your Halloween party or Friday the 13th or after a long hard day working at the morgue",1402790400,2,811,4.006172839506172

Sure the main plot as Robert Jayne, Christie Harris, Christine Taylor, and the other survivors trying to fend off a hard of demon-possessed versions of their former friends but it's basically a combination of sex and demonology.

So glad that I was able to find it, especially on DVD. Part 2 is my favorite, and the best out of the trilogy, in my very humble opinion. It just so happens to be the most difficult to find.

The picture quality is great, the sound as well... Did I mention they play Morbid Angel in the movie?!?! Need I say more.

580915,4,6303148409,"Night of the Demons 2 is so, so, so stupid but at least it knows it's stupid and turns out to be a lot of fun.

The story revolves around a bunch of teenagers from a Catholic boarding school taking a trip to the infamous Hull House on Halloween. What was supposed to be a scary party turns into a hellish night that follows them back to the school.

The acting varies between stiff and goofy, the story is cliche, but it's very tongue-in-cheek. The whole movie is pretty ridiculous and the effects and gore are excellent.

Fans of wacky b-movies are definitely going to get a kick out of this one and it's well worth rewatching. The whole movies is quite deliberately and wonderfully over the top.",1380153600,,697,4.4296875
580916,5,6303148409,"I purchased Night of the Demons 2, because I have been looking for it for a while. I have Night of the Demons 1 and I absolutely loved it. As soon as I got the movie, I opened it up and watched it. It is a Classic Cheesy Rated B Horror movie. I enjoyed it. Granted the killing's in #2 aren't as cool as the first one / in fact there really wasn't that many killings in this one at all. I think there was a total of maybe 5 or 6. However it was still awesome.

The best part about this movie is that the woman that plays Angela ( Amelia Kinkade ) in the first one is in this one also.

SPOILER ALERT:

This one starts off with a bunch of supposedly troubled youths that go to St. Rita's Academy. That get invited to go to a party at Hull House after they are grounded from going to the Halloween dance. They all reluctantly go. That is when the fun begins. Things start to get a little scary, at the house. However, they all end up making it out of the house alive. The real problems arise when one of the stupid girl's ( Phoebe ) takes a tube of lipstick ( the infamous lipstick from the first one ) out of the house when they leave. The minute they cross over the under water stream with the lipstick, they have committed an ultimate no no. Now the demons ( Angela ) of Hull House are free to follow them and reek havoc. I won't spoil anymore of the movie and leave the classic cheesy horror ending for you to watch.....lol.

All in all I think this was worth the buy and watch. If you are a horror movie collector like I am, then you won't be disappointed. The price for a brand new copy in plastic was fairly cheap for a hard to find movie ( I paid $ 14.99 ). The shipping was fast and it was packaged well. I am happy that I enjoyed the movie and I am happy that I made the purchase. No complaints on my behalf.",1373500800,2,1815,3.9643835616438357

580920,5,6303148409,"""Night of the Demons 2"" brilliantly blends gory, supernatural terror with slapstick comedy for an uproarious knee-slapper of a great film. If you enjoyed the first movie, I'm pretty sure you're gonna love this one too. Also featuring Angela from the first one, this features more great chills and laughs at Hull House. Despite the pacing being a bit slow in some parts, there's so much great stuff to love about this film, it's impossible for me not to give it five stars. We have a bunch of babes bound up in this private Catholic boarding school, a rebellious young schemer that looks like Jason Newsted in his glory days with Metallica, a bunch of gore, some fascinating religious themes tied in. What else? Oh yeah, we have a hot demon girl cage-dancing to Morbid Angel (a fantastic death metal band) at said Catholic boarding school's Halloween party! For those of you that like slapstick comedy, witty one-liners, bloodsoaked horror and supernatural terror, this is the movie for you!

Her sister is a part of this school and she is forced to go along. I might be forgetting a piece or two but it really doesnt matter. It's an enjoyable movie with a good story plot but ruined by some cheesy moments like taking super soakers of holy water to battle the demons. The speical effects are decent for the time and the gore is decent but nothing too over the top. I will admit that the end scene was one of the worst speical effect i've seen in my life. Its like the kind you see in those creature features on Sci Fi channel, it was pretty stupid.

St. Rita's high school students ditch their school's Halloween dance to go over to Hull House. They end up bringing the demons back for another night filled with possession. We also get to meet Angela's sister!

Review:

Night of the Demons 2 was no where near as fun as the original. It ended up taking itself a little bit too seriously. I was really excited to see Amelia Kinkade return to play the role of Angela. Her role ended up being extremely disappointing. I think she was a little bored and uninspired. Most of the characters came across as annoying. I couldn't find anyone to root for to survive. The film just seemed to drag on forever without any rewards at the end. And what was up with Sister Gloria (Jennifer Rhodes)? She tried to add humor to the dull storyline, but she came on too strong and ultimately failed.

Pros:

Lots of nudity and gore. That's always a plus! It was fun seeing Angela turn into that creepy snake creature! The lipstick scene was also pretty groovy.

Cons:

Night of the Demons 2 felt like a rated R made-for-television flick. Not great, but it's sure worth checking out.",1242000000,,1120,4.57

I just recieved my copy of Night of the Demons 2 in the mail and after watching it I have to say, wow! It was every bit as good as the original. It's just a shame it took me 15 years to see it. I would recommend the first two Night of the Demons movies to any huge horror fan. I also would recommend the Italian flicks Demons, Demons II, and the Church. You can skip Demons III: The Ogre and Night of the Demons III though. ENJOY!",1238457600,,543,3.900900900900901

There are more laughs in this one which is great because it keeps you from losing interest before all the gore starts.  Poor Angela looks about 30 years older here - so I guess demons age too.  Mrs. Ben Stiller/aka the movie's Marsha Brady is one of of the hornball kids in peril.  Really a lot of fun.  The Nun is hoot and a half!  Enjoy.,1223856000,,450,4.0
581056,5,6303148409,"I been a fan of horror movies since i was 7 years old. That is over two decades. When someone asks me what my favorite horror movies are, i usually tell them there are too many titles to name. But i can always give them one answer that has remained steady since 1994. Which just so happens to be the release year of that one movie. Night of the Demons 2! It is the epitome of what a low budget horror movie should be, and i mean that in the best way possible. Amelia Kinkade and Zoe Trilling really steal the show, especially with their provocative dance at the school's halloween party while under possesion. That along with their steamy kiss, it is guarenteed to get you hot under the colar. Zoe Trilling can almost hypmotize you with her emerald green eyes and magnificent upper extremities. That along with a brilliant dialouge (i.e. ""Save a little room for the holy ghost"") It is guarenteed to keep a smile on your face.

I guess the religion thing kind of made this movie less desirable.  It had potential, but it couldn't quite do what the first movie did.  It didn't really create that Halloween ambiance like the first, the house didn't seem as creepy to me, and the kills were a bit BLAH.  It's not a bad movie but...the first is better and why in the world this one is MORE EXPENSIVE is beyond me.  It's worth adding to your horror collection if you can pick it up for like 5.00-8.00 or something, maybe.  I'm more of a zombie fan anyhoo, not a demon/ghost movie type person.

well....i was soo dissapointed when i saw this dvd transfer today cuz its just AWFUL!.

its is JUST if not a ""copy"" of the VHS version, wich i mean ""quality wise"".

i was hoping a nice clean, clear picture dvd quality.

but nope thats not the case folks!!

if you own the vhs or have seen it. it is the same EXACT quality!!!

very soft like picture with some flickering throught the movie and also no dolby digital 5:1 surround sound. all you get is  2.0 stereo audio.  the vhs if i recall was just hifi stereo so not much of an upgrade.

as for the aspect ratio its NOT widescreen it is FULL screen. so no extra views on the sides or a wider angle.

im telling you this dvd is not worth buying.

if you have the vhs. you can burn yourself a copy on dvd-r dvd-rw and it be the same exact quality as this dvd is. NO joke!

i know i have a dvd-r copy of the vhs, and i swear it is the same.

so please Lionsgate or whoever bought the rights to this film.

release ANOTHER dvd of this cuz this one sucks.

Here we have Angela and yes she's not scary, but I really don't think the movie is meant to be scary, but fun. That it is. While I'll admit it doesn't have the same circle arc as the first one, it still has joyful tounge-in-cheek chuckles. The motif of lipstick, for example, is carried on to this one.

581197,5,6303148409,"Night of the Demons 2 disappointed many people, mostly due to the fact that they seemed to expect something more akin to its predecessor. I don't count myself amongst those individuals, however, because I've come to expect sequels, especially the 1980s horror-based ones, to become more humorous as they progress. Personally, I thought this movie was actually very enjoyable, in part because of the return of Hull House and our favorite possession candidate and in part because of the humor involved. Sequels that take themselves too seriously oftentimes fail as frightening follow-ups.
The movie borders around Halloween once more, the only time the demons can truly be a happy-go-luck bringer of evil. Enter a group of kids from St. Rita's Academy that thought it would be fun to have a party at the infamous Hull House, and you have yourself the beginning of a bloodbath. Added into the story are a few new concepts as well, like the question of what would happen if something were carried across the underground stream keeping the world from Hull House, plus the mainstay of victims-a-plenty living the atypical horror movie life.
If you like movies that can provide a good laugh, some gore, nuns throwing down with the forces of evil, and the always acclaimed Angela, then this is for you.",1024272000,30,1294,4.940366972477064

So much more frightening than all the cliche,big money,overly comical,80's horror franchise villains like Freddy. But in Night of the Demons 2 she did not maintain her aura of evil and gloom she started having one liners and jokes and all the things that ruin good horror villains. Then you have the plot! Oh no what a joke. Okay you get a nun in love with firearms and a school dance and the throwing of holy water balloons. I could go on and on.

The nun and the bookworm kid were pretty cool and I liked the part at the end with the ""mutated"" Angela.  This movie, like Evil Dead 2, kind of goes for the laugh factor than the fear factor, I mean the first two minutes of the movie sets the mood for the rest of the movie.  Without giving too much away Angela is like a demonic ... throughout the movie and making sexual jokes, not that I mindl, but it diminishes her fear factor that was built up so very well in the first one, there's only one scene of her floating around Hull House and that scene was taken from the first one!!!!!
