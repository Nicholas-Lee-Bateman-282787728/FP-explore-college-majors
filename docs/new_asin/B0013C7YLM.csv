3102914,5,B0013C7YLM,"This DVD is a must for any person who is experiencing pain in their hand, arm or back due to playing the piano.  Barbara Lister-Sink is passionate about making music on the piano in the most supple pain free way.  After seeing this video, I contacted Ms Lister-Sink and attended her intensive workshop.  She is an amazing teacher and bases her method on sound medical research. I only wish I was taught piano using the Lister-Sink method when I started piano years ago.  I would highly recommend anyone no matter what age use this method to learn how  not only play the piano but to make music while playing the piano.  Highly recommend the DVD AND pursuing the Lister-Sink method.",1231632000,5,681,4.633333333333334
3102915,5,B0013C7YLM,"""Freeing the Caged Bird"" is the DVD exploring an injury free technique in playing the piano.  Barbara Lister-Sink is magnificent in her approach.  She is innovative and a true leader in this field.  Hundreds of concert musicians and professionals have been helped by her methods.  One learns to  produce not only a pain and excess-tension free method of piano playing, but one also achieves a suppleness and facile technique that enhances the musicality of one's playing tremendously.  She is an Artist in Residence at Salem College and I have the great privilege of studying with her.  She has students and teachers from all over the world in her classes and in her capable care.  You must see this vidoe and explore this technique! What her methods produce musically must be seen and heard to be believed!",1227484800,7,807,4.882352941176471
3102916,5,B0013C7YLM,"This DVD has literally changed my playing and my life.  After several years of searching for answers regarding how to play the piano and organ with greater ease, I was fortunate enough to come across Lister-Sink's informative website, [...]  Barbara Lister-Sink has something extremely wonderful and unique to offer keyboard players of all ages and levels.  She is, first and foremost, a consummate musician who practices that which she preaches.  Her technique is something to be envied by even the greatest virtuosos in the field.  And best of all, she's codified this technique into a rational, step-by-step, scientifically informed method that ensures the highest results.  Of course, since a task as complicated as playing the piano involves one's overall alignment and state of muscles, it can't be learned by watching a DVD.  Learning them requires a step-by-step, hands-on, systematic approach--from the simplest coordinations and most fundamental levels of sound production, to the most complex kinetic patterns.  However, just one viewing of ""Freeing the Caged Bird"" is sure to open the eyes of most piano teachers and students.  She is one of the world's  most gifted pedagogues in the field of injury-prevention and well-coordinated keyboard technique, and it would behoove any serious keyboard player, especially those injured or feeling held back by malcoordination, to get this DVD.",1217721600,16,1397,5.425925925925926

8249752,5,B0013C7YLM,"Clear, valuable instruction.  My piano teacher had me watch this in college, changed not just my technique but my whole approach.  Information applies to many of life's activities, not just piano playing.  This is how you achieve physical freedom in playing.",1512950400,,258,5.2439024390243905
8249753,1,B0013C7YLM,"No info on real technique like rotation, which underlies everything......just lots of relaxation exercises, which may not help if you've already developed serious pain from years of misuse.",1457308800,,189,5.785714285714286
8249754,4,B0013C7YLM,Wonderful techniques explained and demonstrated. This is so valuable to have in my studio to use with students and for myself. I heard Barbara Lister-Sink speak at a pedagogy conference and was immediately drawn to her research and methods. I wish the DVD sound were a little clearer but I understand since it was filmed a while ago and converted to DVD.,1449014400,,354,4.725806451612903

8249756,4,B0013C7YLM,"I do not regret buying this video; it is a good inspiration for being aware and attending to tension in the entire brachial complex.  However, purchasers should be aware that they will not receive sufficient information from this presentation to undertake a self-help regimen, and there is no accompanying book of instruction.  The video is a detailed promotion for the Lister-Sink method that is to be taught by trainers presumably qualified by Lister-Sink in her workshops or taught by herself in private and group lessons. In the video two central chapters do give the general idea of the principles underlying the technique. The steps to the method are interestingly and incompletely demonstrated. There are several advanced demonstrations by Barbara Lister-Sink herself with a very good view of her hands and lower arms; and several progressive examples of the (re)training stages - one note per stroke, two notes per stroke, etc - by her students that are not as closely visible and thus mostly useful as repertoire suggestions.  Lister-Sink indicates her initial keyboard training material, and then names the pieces played to demonstrate the principles and progressive stages, most of which are in the standard repertoire. However, at least one piece (Berens) is quiet beautiful but seems no longer to be in print.  For any such unusual or relatively inaccessible score, documentation or reference for location would have been nice. The entire DVD is over two hours, but few viewers will need to re-view more than 45 minutes of material, thus a useful resource for teaching, but not necessarily private ownership.",1403481600,5,1621,5.223076923076923

Thank you very much Barbara.

8249758,5,B0013C7YLM,"The video  I found this to be a video of outstanding quality and clarity.  Done in a way that takes the viewer step by step sequence by sequence.  Firstly, explains the need to become sensitive and aware of any tension or stress, followed by many hands on exercises that explain from very basics up to quite advanced and ways to play and relax while playing ... freeing the bird within the cage
I""ve only just started the exercises...will keep you posted !",1337040000,4,456,4.536585365853658
8249759,5,B0013C7YLM,"I thought I reviewed this before.  But Amazon invites me to review it, so I will.  I am very glad I bought this DVD.  Lister-Sink says you have to work with a teacher to learn her techniques, but I have found that even without a teacher I can benefit from them.  I have a teacher who works with me on technique, but her native language is not English.  Lister-Sink's explanations and discussions are so clear.  Sometimes I don't get what my teacher is telling me.  With Lister-Sink I get it, and my teacher helps me apply it.  My confidence in my playing is greatly improved.  My listeners tell me they see the improvement, too.  And the hand cramps I used to get when practicing Hanon have completely disappeared.
Consider the price of just one piano lesson from a teacher, and then consider the price of this DVD.  With the DVD, you can go over and over the lessons.  Its worth is way beyond its price.",1330819200,3,904,4.412121212121212
8249760,5,B0013C7YLM,"In this unique DVD, Barbara Lister-Sink shares with the world her marvelous discovery of what many great pianists have known, that piano playing does not have to be strenuous and fatiguing to the body or accompanied by discomfort and pain. Through her practical analysis of the mechanisms of both the piano and the human body, she establishes scientific principles of good coordination and shows the optimal functioning of these two mechanisms as they work together to produce great music. Piano myths are completely debunked, and a demonstration of her methods for teaching pianists the joy of a healthy working relationship between the body and the piano is given. This valuable presentation of piano technique at its best and most useful has the potential to give hope and guidance to frustrated pianists of all ages and levels.",1231977600,7,831,5.117647058823529
8249761,5,B0013C7YLM,"Freeing the caged bird is an overview of what Barbara Lister Sink practices in both her teaching as well as her playing.  The DVD itself is an excellent representative of the technique that it espouses; however, it is no substitute for study with the genuine article herself.  Barbara Lister Sink is an incredibly knowledgeable artist (of the highest order) who has taken a scientific and medically informed approach to the art of keyboard playing.  She seeks, both in her DVD and in her ongoing work, to raise the status quo of piano playing not only beyond the hindrance of injury, pain and malcoordination; but to the greatest height of each individual's artistic potential.  Barbara Lister Sink's method is not only applicable to pianists, but to organists and harpsichordists (and any keyboardists) as well.  Her DVD is an invitation to a higher level of proficiency and a deeper knowledge of musical artistry.  Please visit her website:  [...] for more information concerning her work.",1231804800,7,991,5.080246913580247
