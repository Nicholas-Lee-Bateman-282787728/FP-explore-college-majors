8011240,5,B0001EJMEU,"Used this tape in the 90s and loved it. I was in my thirties then and felt like a teenager using this program. The tape was damaged during a move and I was sick about. Never replaced it. Today I'm in my sixties, out of shape and just located the exact tape on Amazon.  Susan Anton introduced me to isometrics using this toning tape. I'm ready to use this program again and feel like a woman in her thirties once again!",1496016000,,418,4.160493827160494
