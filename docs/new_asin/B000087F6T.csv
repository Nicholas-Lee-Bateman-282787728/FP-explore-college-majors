7979822,3,B000087F6T,"Ohio Valley Wrestling was the breeding ground for top WWE talent for a long time. The WWE recently parted ways with OVW and have moved everyone to Flordia. This set is decent but for a WWE owned company, the production is iffy. Then again the WWE did not release this set. This set is jam packed with matches but most do not go over eight minutes. You'll see Shelton Benjamin, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, Batista and John Cena among some other current WWE stars (expect for Lesnar). Batista as Leviathan was awesome. Why WWE changed this guys name and gimmick, i'll never know. He is real fun to watch on this set. Anther surprise from the set was a tag team named Minnesota Wrecking Crew. It consisted of Shelton Benjamin and Brock Lesnar. Why this team never got over, i'll never know. A team that could have been one of the greatest of all time. However, they had solo plans for both men. That or the fact that tag team wrestling is a dying art.

Overall, a decent buy. Production is iffy, the ring is super small, billboards are plastered all over a couple sides of the ring, Jim Cornette can get annoying after awhile, matches are short but plentiful. Still a good buy if you love wrestling or want to see Cena, Batista, or Orton before they got huge.",1209168000,,1255,4.456521739130435
