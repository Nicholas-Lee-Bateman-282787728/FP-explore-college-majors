4113841,5,B003E697MO,"The 4-part series, narrated by Edward Hermann, is very good. In addition to the films, they interviewed historians and veterans. But I suggest anyone who sees the films also read a few books on the Korean War.  Then, you will understand the films better.

4113842,5,B003E697MO,"As a serious historian, I found this to be the most thorough and honest documentary I have viewed on the Korean War. I have viewed longer documentaries on The Korean War, but if you want the facts presented in a relatively concise manner, less than 3 1/2 hours, I would recommend this offering highly.",1481068800,13,301,4.592592592592593

4113850,4,B003E697MO,"This is a solid 2-DVD, 4-part documentary that currently airs on the Military History Channel. I got the DVDs from my library. I'm more of a WWII buff, and I've seen a lot of documentaries. This series served its main purpose of providing an overview of the war's events before I read more about it.

I was surprised how well the series covers the military aspects of the Korean conflict. The interviews with American military historians and veterans provide both a high-level explanation of what happened, and a powerful, personal eyewitness view of what it was like to live through those events.

Basically, the 4 parts of the documentary cover the entire war, although the emphasis is on 1950. So, part one generally covers the North Korean invasion and the battles around Pusan. The second part covers Inchon and the UN march north to the Yalu. The third video covers the entry of the Chinese and their pummeling of the UN forces. The fourth video is sort of a catch all, covering the stalemate, the drawn-out negotiations, and the end of the war, while touching upon contributions from the US Navy and Air Force. Each episode runs about 50 minutes.

The script and narration are generally excellent. They fairly cover the strengths and weaknesses of the South and North Korean armies, the Chinese, and the other UN forces. However, the documentary does not interview any other participants besides Americans. Maybe it's time for a longer, more comprehensive series that covers more aspects of the war from the other nationalities. That said, the interview subjects seemed fair to all parties, critical of US forces and leadership where they needed to be, and also appropriately complimentary and critical of the other forces involved. Also, the series offers a straightforward history, and it does not attempt to put the war into a wider context or measure its impact on following events like Vietnam, later Cold War foreign policy, or the relationship of the 2 Koreas and the rest of the region (relevant and newsworthy even today).

It is generally PG, except for one profanity and many shots of dead bodies. None of this bothered me as an adult (this is war, after all), but the series seems suitable to high-school students on up.

Overall, I'd recommend this documentary as a good introduction or refresher for this Cold War conflict.",1419206400,6,2344,4.909090909090909
4113851,5,B003E697MO,Already possessing eight VHS and DVDs of the Korean War...I could easily be critical of an inferior addition. Not so with this on. It is well presented and explained and covers the war's history exceedingly well.,1401235200,7,212,4.916666666666667
4113852,5,B003E697MO,This is the more Extensive story of what happened in Korea.  I didn't like the Firing of MacArthur. He should have been given permission to use Nuclear Weapons.,1396915200,,160,4.714285714285714

4113857,5,B003E697MO,"The best, and most coherent, video documentary on the Korea War that I've seen. The series came to my attention while watching the Military or History channel when I caught a couple of episodes. I looked to see if Amazon had it and fortunately they did. I only wish, as a Army Officer who recently served a tour Korea, that I'd seen this documentary prior to being stationed there, it would have given me a deeper appreciation and understanding of our role in that now wonderful country.",1318982400,16,487,4.609195402298851

4113859,2,B003E697MO,"i have not watched really much of the documentary...It DOES look interesting..but the sound quality is seemingly just awful. I don't know if the production company maybe made an error when they made my dvd set. I have turned the sound up nearly 3/4 of the way up..and can barely hear it at all.

maybe i recieved a pirated copy? anyone can tell me who the production company is of this dvd set?

thanks",1314662400,,402,4.418918918918919
4113860,5,B003E697MO,"I really enjoyed this documentary, and will watch it again.

Three good points and a bad:

Edward Hermann is an outstanding narrator. He oozes credibility. The cinematography and editing were also very engaging. Finally, in four discs, the series was information dense, and I particularly appreciated the emphasis on the politics of the war.

The one thing I would have like to see more about was the campaign at Chosin. I have heard quite a bit about it from other sources, but didn't see much in this series.

Overall, a great investment for a history hobbyist or student.",1310774400,21,574,4.826530612244898

8395373,1,B003E697MO,"As expected from The History Channel, this is a left-wing piece laced with word choices and nuances that could have come from the propaganda machines of Beijing, Panmunjong or some American university faculties. The Communist leaders and armies were mostly portrayed in as positive light as possible, while the UN forces, especially American, were condescendingly described as ill-led, hapless victims. There was some attempt at balance at the very end, but the bias of the producers we pretty evident throughout. Could have been great, given the material at their disposal, but sadly, this will be viewed by youth into the future and this will be the picture of the war they will believe.",1496016000,6,689,5.106194690265487
