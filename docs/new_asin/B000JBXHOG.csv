2668004,4,B000JBXHOG,"If your into Greek Mythology and need to understand what these so called Gods and Goddesses history was, this video will give you some good insight and history. THe DVD has alot of Great Images and History insight-

I recommend Christians start looking into this because from a Biblical view it will help you undertsand what was going on before Noahs Flood. Of coarse this DVD mentions nothing about the bible but when you link the Atalntis story with the book of Enoch and some Genesis accounts you will see that Greek Mythology really was all about Fallen Angles. The FAllen Angels that mated with humans is what Greek Mythology is all about!

I thought it was faulty so I sent it back and got another, but the second one did the same thing, and I tried it on other players. I was very sorry not to be able to see it and wonder what is wrong with the discs.",1173398400,4,292,3.80327868852459

2668065,4,B000JBXHOG,I enjoyed this but I intended to use it in my Roman History class. Some of the material was not suitable for younger students. I still recommend it.,1389052800,2,148,4.321428571428571

IT IS VERY WELL DONE AND IT IS ENTERTAINING WHILE BEING INFORMATIVE.  I LOVE THIS LINE OF VIDEOS!  THEY ARE A GREAT ADDITION, NOT A SUBSTITUTION FOR TEACHING THE MYTHOLOGY UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO SHOW A BRIEF OVERVIEW.",1365033600,7,336,4.475409836065574

2668101,3,B000JBXHOG,"To my dismay, I discovered is that the DVD does not include Closed Captioning which makes it unusable for my classes with deaf students. I was shocked that a History Channel documentary did not have this feature.  Otherewise, the DVD is a great resource for literature classes as an introduction to the historical and cultural background of the ancient Greeks.",1362700800,5,360,5.0

2668105,2,B000JBXHOG,"I purchased this video for use in my classroom.  My core resource is Edith Hamilton's Mythology.  The video's stories do not align much with this repuatable book.  Oversimplification and bizarre tellings of myths riddle this documentary.  Myths are also constantly compared and contrasted with Judeo-Christian mythology.
This program consists of interviews with scholars interspersed with a voiceover narrating myths.  These myths are illustrated by classical pieces of painting and sculpture.  Immature classrooms might not handle well the naked figures therein.
Purchasing this video has been a waste.  I will not use it in my classroom.",1298937600,15,639,5.663157894736842
2668126,3,B000JBXHOG,"I found this video to be OK for its time-limited content.  I would really like to see
what they could do with a few HOURS of video,and less ""editorial supervision""....It seems that
this is really a watered down version designed to keep the general public dumb concerning
the vast importance and wide spread influence of these mythical solar gods... However, it
is good mindless entertainment.",1297036800,4,392,5.030769230769231
2668127,4,B000JBXHOG,"I bought this for my 9th grade English class as a supplement to The Odyssey.  It's a well-made film, but a bit slow-paced for most of my students.",1294185600,2,146,4.214285714285714
2668128,4,B000JBXHOG,I thought this version would give me more insight into the Gods and Goddesses of ancient Greece.  The production is great. Plenty of historical scenes.  What I didn't like about it is that it doesn't give you anything new that someone who has studied ancient religion would not already know.  Great for middle school and high school students or for those who know nothing of ancient gods and goddesses.,1285027200,19,402,4.797101449275362
2668129,3,B000JBXHOG,"I ordered this to show to my 6th grade class when we started a unit on mythology.  Although the documentary is well-done, the kids started getting a little restless about half-way through.  Maybe older kids would appreciate it more.",1278806400,9,232,4.923076923076923
2668130,4,B000JBXHOG,"As others have said, this is a solid video introducing the Greek/Roman mythology.  You will get a quick introduction to the major gods spelled out by experts.  Happily, they are all reasonably entertaining speakers.  The material is presented at a good pace but if you are a novice there is a LOT of material here for a single sitting.  One nice feature that others have not mentioned is the discussion of the integration of Greek/Roman religions and cultures into/with other cultures.  The discussion of the parallels between these religions and Christianity is thought provoking.  If you don't know much about the Greek/Roman gods and want to start building a foundation this is a great place to start.",1270339200,29,704,4.9743589743589745
2668131,4,B000JBXHOG,"I am a ninth grade English teacher, and I ordered this DVD to help prepare my students for reading excerpts from The Odyssey. I don't show the entire program. I think there are eight parts (chapters on the DVD), and I show four of the eight. My students seemed to like the program, although I had to prepare them for the ""talking head"" academics who show up from time to time. Their commentary is interesting, but kids seem to tune out a DVD as soon as someone comes on the screen and there aren't any graphics, interesting pictures, etc. All in all, I think it is a worthwhile purchase for a teacher looking for supplemental material related to Greek mythology.",1268524800,22,662,4.525
2668132,5,B000JBXHOG,I thought this documentary was well made and had good narration. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone with an interest in classical mythology. It gives a good overview of the gods & goddesses and is well balanced with academic interviews throughout.,1241913600,38,254,5.071428571428571

8149680,4,B000JBXHOG,"This is good for what it is: a documentary produced on a cable TV budget.  As such, the viewer is treated to a lot repetitious use of a few live-action clips to season the relatively interesting if somewhat dry commentary.  As someone who has studied ancient history a bit, I'm always a sucker for this type of programming and this is certainly adequate for me as an intellectual after dinner mint.

For the average consumer, it is somewhat entertaining, but I would advise him or her not to take this as a thorough treatment, as the myths of Greece are complex, profound and voluminous.  The ""talking head"" treatment is somewhat disorganized and incomplete as an approach to such a vast subject.

For mildly educational programming to watch when Saturday afternoon TV fails you, I would recommend it.  At least it won't kill any brain cells.",1485475200,3,842,4.772413793103448
