8398056,2,B003JEEWTE,"With the blood supply polluted by drugs, alcohol, and disease, vampires are forced into rival clans that fight for control over the last clean humans, but a rogue hunter known only as The Priest looks to stop them once and for all! Tim Thomerson stars as the sword-wielding slayer, whose age has unfortunately caught up with him. He is simply unable to carry the action sequences, which are terrible in their own right. As poor as this film really is, it is literally drenched in blood and gore. Though the effects may be crude, they are extremely effective for the budget. Director Jay Woelfel also makes several ambitious attempts in the small production, including an impressive car chase in the desert and an interesting premise for the bloodsuckers. That is about where the praise ends, since the rest of the film suffers from most other typical low-budget pitfalls. The plot goes nowhere and the acting is expectedly bad. The only real enjoyment comes from watching Thomerson slice a baby's head off with his katana. B-movie fans can do much, much worse, but LIVE EVIL is base entertainment at best.

8398057,5,B003JEEWTE,"I always go into watching low budget movies with an open mind.  More times than not many b-movie sink below expectations.  I for sure can't say that of ""Live Evil.""  Tim Thomerson aka Jack Deth from Trancers plays a vampire slayer priest on the hunt of a small group of blood suckers.  This film has a nostalgic look and delivers everything you might expect in to low budget romp.  From babes, to blood, to high paced action, and even some interesting newcomers, this movie will not disappoint.

The DVD is jammed packed with extras.  The director commentary and behind the scenes really invite a non movie person like me on to the set of one of these films that are not funded by studios.

Give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1280448000,2,745,4.507462686567164
8398058,1,B003JEEWTE,"I have to disagree with the previous reviews because for me this film was a waste of money esp since it cost 3.99 rather than 2.99 like most of the other older movies.  While viewing this film I almost stopped it several times to watch something else, but decided that since I had already purchased it I may as well sufffer throught it.  It was just plain lame and the special effects were awful. My recommendation is that if you are looking for a good vampire movie KEEP LOOKING!!",1269216000,3,481,4.393258426966292

I just watched it VOD and now I can't wait for the DVD to add it to my own library!  I don't want to talk about the film because I don't want to give anything away, but you won't be disappointed!  Check it out!!",1258848000,3,360,3.9444444444444446
