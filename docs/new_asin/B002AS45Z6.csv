3891228,5,B002AS45Z6,"The second season of ""The Mighty Boosh"" is probably even wackier than the first. There are changes this time around (Howard and Vince are no longer working at a zoo, and instead are musicians), but one thing remains the same in terms of what to expect: Expect the unexpected. No matter how familiar you are with the Boosh, nothing can prepare you for the flood of random hilarity that takes place in each episode.

Howard Moon, Vince Noir, Naboo the shaman, and Bollo the ape are the only returning characters, but the actor who played zoo manager Bob Fossil in the 1st season plays a number of roles in season 2 as well. Here's a quick summary/rating for all 6 episodes:

""The Call of the Yeti"" -5/5:
Howard decides that he, Vince, Naboo, and Bollo should take a weekend vacation at a cabin deep in the woods. But when they get there, they encouter a creepy old mountain-man named Kodiak Jack....who develops an affinity for Vince. Howard tells him he's a nature photographer and is looking for animals to photograph, so Jack makes a deal with him and gives him a map to a Yeti lair. Let the mayhem ensue.

""The Priest and the Beast"" -3/5:
Howard and Vince are trying to find a new sound, and they go to Naboo for help. Naboo proceeds to tell them the story of Rudi and Spider, two psychadelic musicians who always went looking for ""The New Sound"". It shouldn't take you long to figure out that Rudi is basically a funky, black, door-in-his-afro guitar playing version of Howard, and Spider a sex-driven, Mexican-sounding Vince who got his name (Spider) for having 8 of a certain body part...

""Nanageddon"" -5/5:
A personal favorite of mine. Howard and Vince try to impress a couple of Goth girls by showing them some magic. Unfortunately, they read a spell from Naboo's dark magic book and summon up a seemingly harmless old woman. The girls leave and Vince and Howard try to convince them to stay, but it's no good. To make matters worse, when they return to the living room, the book and the Nana are gone! From then on, it's a nonstop quest to find the book before the Nana, who is actually the most dangerous demon alive, can create a Nana army to take over the world. We also meet a board of Shaman who act as Naboo's superiors in this episode.

""The Fountain of Youth"" -5/5:
Howard begins feeling old and self-conscious about his crow's feet, so when he overhears Bollo telling Vince that the key to Naboo's youthful appearance is that he has access to the fountain of youth, Howard knows what must be done. While going through Naboo's room, Howard and Vince stumble upon an amulet that transports them to another planet where they are captured by the locals. Vince is made their king, and Howard his slave, while all the while an evil green cockney resembling the Hitcher from the first season plots how he can steal the amulet from Vince and find the fountain of youth for himself.

""The Legend of Old Gregg"" -5/5:
The best of the boosh! After a bad gig, Howard and Vince are forced to leave town and wind up in a small fisherman's town called ""Black Lake"". A shell-minded fisherman named Ramsey tells them the best way to unwind is to go out on Black Lake when the moon is full and fish away. What he doesn't tell them is what lurks in the murky waters of Black Lake; a scaly green tutu-wearing man-fish named Old Gregg. It should also be noted that Old Gregg is a hermaphrodite who takes a liking to Howard. Didn't see that one coming did you?

""The Nightmare of Milky Joe"" -5/5:
Howard and Vince are made to walk the plank after Vince gives the ship's captain a mullet he doesn't like. Stranded on a deserted island and left to their own devices, the pair come up with their own friends made from cocnuts, Milky Joe (for Howard) and Ruby (for Vince). As time progresses, we see newer coconut faces and our boys develop relationships with some of the coconut ladies. But all relationships have their ups and downs, and Howard's is no exception...

The Moon makes regular appearances throughout the episodes and gives a little side about whatever's on his tiny little mind. It's no wonder why the Head-with-tentacles Tony Harrison calls him an ""Alabastor Retard"" (""Nanageddon""). In season 2, the characters are more eccentric, the scenery more colorful, and the plots more sporadic. So sit back. Relax. Cause the Boosh is loose and it's comin at ya like a shark with knees.",1249084800,,4384,4.575796178343949
3891229,5,B002AS45Z6,"I highly recommend Boosh series 2 if you like your offbeat, surrealistic, whimsical, rock'n'roll sitcoms to be creamy and beige.",1246838400,5,128,5.45
3891230,5,B002AS45Z6,"Goodbye, Zooniverse. Hello life of yetis, deranged sea hermaphrodites and musical glamour!

And so unsurprisingly, things continue to be utterly strange and deranged in ""The Mighty Boosh: Season 2"" even when our wacky protagonists have left their old jobs at the zoo. I can't help but miss some of the freakish side-characters of the previous season, but the visual bizarrities, freak-show plots and surrealist details keep things utterly amazing from start to finish.

Howard  Moon (Julian Barratt) and Vince Noir (Noel Fielding) are living in a flat with Naboo the mystic and the talking ape Bollo, and are apparently trying to launch a music career. Howard does the music, Vince does the costumes.

In the first episode, a soul-killing trip to a mountain cabin is interrupted by the deranged hick Kodiak Jack (who immediately develops a huge crush on Vince). Too bad they're also in danger from a bunch of breeding Yeti, and Howard inadvertently ends up in their hands. Paws. Whatever. And during Vince and Howard's search for a new psychedelic musical sound before the deadline, Naboo tells them a strange story of Rudi and Spider (""Feel the power of my fusion lick!"").

Then an age crisis sends Vince and Howard to Naboo's home planet to find the Fountain of Youth, but run afoul of the Hitcher and the Xooberon Tribe. An attempt to impress some goth girls (""Goth Juice, most powerful hairspray known to man... made from the tears of Robert Smith"") causes disaster when Vince uses Naboo's ""hardcore"" black magic book to summon the evillest evil demon Nanatoo, who looks a lot like a little old lady and clones herself... meaning they're faced with Nanageddon!

And after a horrendous gig, Howard accidentally reels in the deranged sea hermaphrodite known as Old Gregg -- and ends up not only Gregg's captive, but the unwilling subject of his amorous intentions. Additionally, Gregg has The Funk... and Howard wants it. And a boat trip to the US goes horribly wrong when the boys end up marooned on a distant tropical island (Vince trimmed the captain's hair), where the boundaries of reality and fantasy start to blur. Fear the coconuts.

""The Mighty Boosh"" is your basic average sitcom... on enough acid to fry its colorful little brains and send it flying across the universe on Naboo's magic carpet. This is a universe where the moon regularly says weird and nonsensical things, an extraterrestrial shaman and a talking gorilla live in the next room, and random music references abound (ranging from the Cure to Kings of Leon) -- and these aren't the weirdest things that go on.

As if the plots weren't surreal enough, Barratt and Fielding swathe the entire series in a sort of whimsical weirdness. Lots of strange dialogue (""I've got a strong feeling the Tudour look's gonna come back in while we're away. I don't want to get left behind!""), toilet humor (naturally), bizarre life-forms (Yetis! Coconuts! Old Gregg and his... oh, I can't say it!), weird outfits for Vine (the mirror-ball suit!) and a casual acceptance that anything can and will happen.

Barratt and Fielding are also quite awesome as a sort of surreal Odd Couple -- Barratt is great as a sort of lame-duck aspiring Artiste unaware of his intense uncoolness, while Fielding is deliciously over-the-top as a foppish, androgynous sort who changes his personal style every time it suits him (including renaming himself ""Obsidian"" to impress a pair of stereotypical goth girls). Michael Fielding also gets a good supporting role as too-mellow-to-not-be-taking-chemicals shaman-alien Naboo, who unfortunately is the smart one here.

""The Mighty Boosh Season 2"" will leave you missing the Zooniverse, but it's still a brilliantly bizarre twist on your usual sitcom. Absolutely a must-see, for those who like to see the boundaries stretched, snapped, and doused in paint.",1244764800,11,3841,5.044164037854889
3891231,4,B002AS45Z6,"This season of The Mighty Boosh moves the main setting out of the Zooniverse and into a shop in the city. Howard Moon and Vince Noir and no longer zoo keepers, but unhappy retail employees who long to be rock stars. Naboo and Bollo and the Gorilla and all still present, but Bob Fossil is gone and so Rich Fulcher takes on reoccurring roles and bit parts. None the less, there are still surreal adventures, plenty of hilariously writing and some really great design work.

The only episode in this season I'm not a fan of is the Priest and the Beast, as it leaves our main characters and I didn't find it all that funny. All the other episodes, though, are winners in my book. The Hitcher returns to torture our heroes, Old Gregg shows off his man-gina and Naboo's origins are revealed!",1483747200,,786,4.458333333333333

As ever, the show is surreal and silly but also well-observed, consistently producing ridiculous but archetypal characters.  Oh, and stupid, catchy songs (you will sing to yourself about loving the Chosen One).  Caveats for Americans/recommendation for Anglophiles: esoterically British, low budget, campy.

Season 2's Nanageddon, though, is one of the best Boosh episodes yet.",1361923200,,423,5.101449275362318
