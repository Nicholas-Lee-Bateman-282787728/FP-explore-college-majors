8231777,3,B000YBLHGQ,"This DVD is particularly helpful if you already own the book. As you would know, then, Adam must have OCD, because his books are so incredibly complete/complex, that it makes it hard sometimes to see here he is going. Well, in this DVD he tells you. Most of it I already knew, but there were some nuggets.

BTW - the red envelope people have this for rent! And the whole wizard thing is, IMHO REALLY cheezy :-P !",1376352000,,412,4.282051282051282
8231778,4,B000YBLHGQ,"Okay, this DVD solo would be completely worthless, but as a companion to the books it is very good. If you own the book and want to have the writer give you a detailed explanation then get it. It is a very dry movies and the ""wizard"" is a bit dorky, but he seems to do it to mask his face so more power to him. Get a jamming guys and gals!",1365724800,,339,3.7222222222222223
8231779,1,B000YBLHGQ,"If you think devil worship is cool then this is the video for you. Why the instructor decided to dress up like the Grim Reaper and look like he is broacasting from hell, I will never know. But I for one do not find it funny.",1328832000,2,224,3.891304347826087
8231780,4,B000YBLHGQ,"I would recommend watching this in multiple sittings, A lot of the concepts are foundations. This DVD helps you understands concepts from the book that may be confusing.",1311552000,,169,5.071428571428571
8231781,5,B000YBLHGQ,"Each DVD is rich with guitar playing concepts and theory. The DVD flows extremely fast, but armed with a ""pause"" button a user can absorb a lot. Each DVD is jammed packed with viable information and technique, even though there's a cheesy Grim Reaper explaining these lessons throughout the DVD.
I recommend these DVD's to anyone interested in learning or getting better at playing guitar.",1284681600,2,389,5.0
