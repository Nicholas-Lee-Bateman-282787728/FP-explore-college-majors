8579799,2,B00CBDG5AS,"Documentaries are rather biopic and walk a fine line between actual enlightenment against the marketable value of entertainment. Whether or not ""Alien Crash At Roswell: The Truth Lost In Time"" offers anything new to the mythos of the Roswell crash or rather anything new to Jesse Marcel's story is something that I could not define. I love Alien and UFO conspiracies and stories but I am not a major buff when it comes to the multitude of information surrounding such topics. I can say that what info I gathered from this documentary was knowledge that I already heard from many other documentaries about the incident or people involved. I can say that it was entertaining as most documentaries about Aliens and UFO's is to me. I enjoyed the added interviews from Marcel's family members, most notably the descendants that bare his name. After viewing this documentary I still don't know if anything really new was discovered or if it adds to the collection of info already out there. Philip Coppens is fun to watch and his enthusiasm is obvious. He is someone that I have become familiar with through the television series that he is attached to- 'Ancient Aliens'. Check ""Alien Crash At Roswell"" out if you are a die hard follower of everything Roswell, but for the random viewer with basic intrigue, I can not say whether or not this docu is a must see.",1438646400,,1355,4.745762711864407
8579800,5,B00CBDG5AS,I was quite interested in the additional information that was discussed because I had not heard about this before.  This backs up Philip Corso's story regarding material from UFO given to Industrial Companies to back engineer and market.,1395446400,3,237,5.2368421052631575
8579801,5,B00CBDG5AS,Great show.  I have really been getting into watching these type of shows and cannot express how much I enjoy them.,1378080000,2,115,4.476190476190476
