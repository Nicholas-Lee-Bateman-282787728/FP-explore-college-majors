7565554,2,B01995ZGHS,"2 is an odd series that definitely offsets the first.  The story is lesser in quality than the first.  The new characters, plot and overall atmosphere just total out to an uniteresting story that is not worthy to take place in the universe in which the original was set (big fan of the original series).

Skip this too, as one of the best characters in the series, Ko, doesn't even make an appearance. Newcomers should just watch the original 2-cour series and then the film that is releasing on blu-ray in June, which I am excited for!

Here's hoping for a psycho-pass 3 which is on par with the film and original 2-cour series.",1459728000,2,629,4.491228070175438
7565555,4,B01995ZGHS,"While it may not quite meet the heights of the first season, this is a more than worthy successor, with a riveting, wonderfully written story. A must watch for any fan of Psycho-Pass.",1458950400,,183,4.575757575757576
7565556,5,B01995ZGHS,This is probably one of the best animes currently on the market. Not only do they consistently make great episodes that always hold your interest but it takes you on a psychological thrill ride as well.,1458604800,3,202,4.638888888888889
7565557,5,B01995ZGHS,"Despite what many people claim, Psycho-Pass Season 2 is a fantastic story and excellent follow-up to Season 1.

At 11 episodes, the story is fast-paced, tight and multi-layered, with storylines weaved together in ways that force the viewer to not only pay attention, but watch the episodes multiple times to fully grasp everything that is happening.

It seems that most people claim three things ruin this season: 1) No Kogami. 2) No Makishima-level antagonist. 3) ""Convoluted"" storytelling with multiple ""plot holes."" Se let's take a look at these one by one and see why these are non-issues.

1) No Kogami. Yes, this is true, and upon first viewing, sad. Kogami was the co-main protagonist of the first season, and was deservedly heralded as one of the greatest anime characters of all-time. His sense of justice was a perfect buffer for Akane's, and his desire to be free made him the perfect mirror for Makishima. HOWEVER, him not being in Season 2 helped out several things. Firstly, it gave Akane the full spotlight, which was great to see, as she had picked up many of Kog's habits and thought patterns and had matured as an inspector in her own right. Secondly, it allowed room for other characters, such as my personal favorite, Jouji Saiga. Having Kogami there in an eleven-episode season would have surely cut out all of the development of most of the secondary characters. And lastly, it wouldn't make sense for him to be around this season, as he needed to flee the country after defying Sybil. It's that simple.

2) No Makishima-level antagonist. While it's true that Makishima is perhaps the BEST antagonist of all time, that isn't to say that Kamui isn't great as well. If you view Sybil as God and Kamui as a disenfranchised Jesus, the story clicks a lot more easily and shows just how fantastic he and his ideologies are.

3) ""Convoluted "" storytelling with multiple ""plot holes."" My friend watched this season before I did, and this was his biggest critique. (This sentiment is echoed throughout various internet forums.) As much as I love my friend, he's flat-out wrong. At first viewing, this may appear to be the case, but multiple viewings reveal intricate details spread throughout that ultimately connect everything and make sense of the seemingly contradictory. Psycho-Pass is great because it breaks down complex philosophies and ideas so that everyone can easily understand it. Psycho-Pass is even greater because it also trusts its viewers to piece together very, very complex plot points.

One last thing - the music in this season is superior, and I'm not just referring to the OPs end EDs. All of the best background music pieces return from the first season, and the new, Tron-like tracks make for an even more varied and exhilarating experience. Fantastic music all around.

Season 2 is not Season 1, and that's okay. It's different, shorter, faster and, in some respects, better.",1458172800,12,2914,4.922606924643585
7565558,5,B01995ZGHS,"If you enjoyed the 1st season of Psycho-Pass, you'll enjoy this season as well. This one is more about Akane Tsunemori and how she's grown as the de facto leader of Division 1. I also find the story, although not as good, to be a little more cohesive as it just flows better.
Just like the 1st set, this set is more expensive than the regular set being it's $80 compared to $50, for the regular set, here on Amazon. Anyway, also like the 1st set, this premium set comes with an chipboard box and a booklet but, the regular set will have both blu ray and dvds. Also like the 1st set, you can not turn the subtitles off. It's either English or Japanese with English subtitles and you can not switch between them without going to the pop-up / menu button. As usual, the extra are disappointing as they only contain episode 10 video commentary, clean opening / closing songs and trailers.",1457136000,6,884,4.396341463414634
7565559,4,B01995ZGHS,"I haven't reviewed the first series, but, you know, after about 30 or so thorough reviews already present, there is only so much you can add. Let me just say that Psycho-Pass season 1 deserves its rating of 5 stars (or something close to that). I say this because, unfortunately, season 2 does not surpass its predecessor. HOWEVER, it remains a worthy and engaging successor, and any fans of the 1st season must check it out for a thrilling continuation of a unique story.

STORY: Akane is now the head of her squad in the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. If you are looking at this review, chances are that you have already seen the first series. If you haven't, check it out first, lest you do yourself a disservice. Rather than the somewhat episodic nature of the first collection of the 1st season, this is a fluid storyline into the investigation of a series of terrorist attacks done by a group of people who cannot be judged by SYBIL. Because of the time lapse, things get off to a rocky start, but I assure you that the show soon finds its footing for a steady pacing that is perfectly wrapped up thanks to its length. It is mysterious, thrilling, and once again questions the morality of the SYBIL system, providing in-depth analysis that raises more questions for the next series.

CHARACTERS: Akane is a little more by-the-books, but this is now mostly her story. Only two other characters (featured on the front cover of this DVD case) receive any development, besides Saiga and the SYBIL system itself, so be prepared for a very limited character-study. Their dynamic is well-done and focused, but Akane and the story itself, naturally, is the focus. The villain, a chill guy named Kamui, is a far cry from the genius and threat that Makishima posed. Makishima is on a whole different level; the only thing Kamui has over him is a rather interesting (albeit somewhat complex and slightly preposterous) backstory. Nevertheless, the characters remain interesting for the series' running time.

ANIMATION: Stunning, per usual. If you saw the original with all of its bright, polished highlights and dark, detailed backgrounds, paired with fluid animation and intense action scenes executed by oddly original-yet-reused character designs, expect the same here: a treat for the eyes.

SOUND: ONCE AGAIN, very similar to the last series; think ""Tokyo Ghoul"" meets ""Ghost in the Shell."" Techno and J-pop mixes galore, and an opening theme that is visually splendid but tunefully passable. Everything is well-composed and fitting to the tone, but don't expect anything catchy or prone to trigger nostalgic-nerves later on.

Honestly, there is not much to say about this season that the first hasn't already done already. The stakes aren't all that higher, and all I can really say is that it is good build-up for the next season. However, the lack of a compelling antagonist and a somewhat dull and discardable cast of characters rubs off the shine that they brought in the first season. It is still an original idea, but the concept is starting to wear off. Even so, if you found yourself impressed by the first season, you will, at the very least, be satisfied by the second. Take my word as you see fit.",1451952000,14,3234,4.851449275362318

7565563,5,B01995ZGHS,Absolutely one of the best animes out there - from someone who hasn't liked anime in a long time.,1482710400,,97,4.157894736842105
7565564,5,B01995ZGHS,"- Synopsis: About a year has passed since the events that unfolded in the first season. Akane is in charge of new enforces and a few familiar faces. Another unique threat disrupts the peace once again. This time around, there is a mysterious individual who claims that they can lower the crime coefficient of those they talk to. Could this person have discovered a method that nobody else knows about? Or is it simply the claims of someone delusional? Tune in to find out.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Wish it was a bit longer but still a nice sequel to the first one. Akane has come a long way since episode one of the first season. Like in Cross Ange, it is a bit bittersweet to see someone have to become really tough to survive. This anime is very interesting and will have you question many things and may have you challenge the perspective you have on certain aspects in life. Such as ethics and their justifications. The references to certain people from the books the characters read is pretty nice too. But unless you take interest in philosophy and the like, that probably wouldn't matter.

- Analysis: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 11 episodes on 2 DVDs, and 11 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. Has an approximate run-time of 4.5 hours and is rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and language.

- Conclusion: Overall, great series in general and can be educational and leave you in suspense. I would also recommend watching the movie after seeing this one as well. To help give the viewer more closure from the series. The Psycho-Pass series is excellent for more mature viewers that enjoy dialogue-heavy and thought-provoking animes.

8744450,5,B01995ZGHS,"Personally I love everything about this anime! I agree with some of the other reviewers that this season may not be quite as thorough and in depth as the first season. But understandably, the first season more or less had to provide the exposition about all the working wheels within the wheels of the world in which this anime takes place.  Nevertheless, the second season is a necessary continuation of the greater goal of the anime as a thought experiment of what a world in which all the psychological judgements and consequences can be determined by a system alone which cannot correctly make such judgements of all beings unless it too has an organic foundation that can be cultivated and adapt in order to better understand the complexities of the human condition.",1523664000,,771,4.840909090909091
