5317207,4,B009D1G9S4,"This is a great show from the late 50's. I collect classic TV on DVD, so
I've been waiting for years on this one. I am unfamiliar with this company
plus the packaging looks unusual. However, I give it 4 stars because of
the rarity of the series, and I am hopeful in a decent restoration.",1350000000,6,287,4.142857142857143
5317208,4,B009D1G9S4,I had never seen the show before until 'This Network' started showing it at 4 am (I work nights so I watch it on my nights off).  It is interesting to see Lloyd Bridges in something serious after seeing him on Seinfeld and Airplane.  He does very well playing a serious role and I enjoy the show.,1348617600,9,296,4.175438596491228

5317211,5,B009D1G9S4,"For some reason, one of episodes at the end of a DVD, was cut short.  But otherwise, I am very happy.  The reproduction is excellent.  We've really enjoyed seeing episodes we have seen before, but many that we have not seen before.",1438041600,,231,4.4523809523809526
5317212,5,B009D1G9S4,"I love this series!  Beginning with the music that sets the tone for these underwater dramas, the variety of scenes from locations in different locations in the World, together with interesting other characters, these adventurous episodes grab your attention.  Much actual knowledge of diving is shown.  Also, boomers will remember Lloyd Bridges.  Recommend to anyone who loves the sea and underwater adventure. If you thought this was just some cool underwater adventures, you're in for a surprise. Bridges plays a really tough guy, who encounters other characters with often a dark nature, as well as very attractive women.",1436745600,,625,5.346938775510204
5317213,5,B009D1G9S4,"Great show!. Despite the fact that most of the show is filmed at Marine Land Florida. the plots for each show unfold with details of Scuba, Skin and deep diving. I get the impression Lloyd Bridges was really(!) into this part as there is something new introduced every couple of episodes. Sometimes it's details about decompression requirements for surfacing after a dive. Other times it's a new piece of diving equipment or soime accessory that enable him to travel farther underwater. With details and gadgets like that incorporated into the show either the actor gets fed up with things changing or, shows up for work asking ""What, new, have you got for me to use this week?"" I think he had it made!",1433980800,,702,4.715447154471545

5317215,5,B009D1G9S4,"Those old, dark 'Sea Hunt' DVDs with crunchy soundtracks culled from old 16mm syndication prints can be tossed.
The film quality found in this 'Marathon' release is really superior and worth your attention. The films themselves can now be watched without focusing on that 58 year-old hair in the gate...
I highly recommend this DVD set!",1430611200,,336,5.017857142857143
5317216,5,B009D1G9S4,"Terrific stuff!  As a Dive Master, really enjoy watching the development of techniques and safety of the sport.  The episodes are a lot of fun and the early production, techniques and acting are very entertaining!",1430265600,,213,5.057142857142857

I frequently marvel at the underwater photography used for virtually all of the episodes.  Sea Hunt sparked a big interest in scuba diving at the time.  I was about 10 years old when the series debuted and watching them again is a great nostalgia trip.",1423612800,,407,4.373333333333333

It's kind of fun to look for the bloopers that got left in, as well as noticing how differently ""political correctness"" was viewed back then.

5317233,4,B009D1G9S4,"This is a great series from an era gone by.  I remember watching this when I was a kid.  Now that I am a former skin diver, it is a bit passe, but still fun.  Hard to beat the entertainment.  Life in circa 60's was quite different then now.",1418342400,,240,3.836734693877551
5317234,5,B009D1G9S4,"I watched Sea Hunt when I was a kid and the show originally aired, and it was one of my favorites. I hadn't seen any reruns of this show since the early 60s, so it was a real treat to view these again. Watching them again as an adult is great! I highly recommend these for people of my vintage, but younger viewers might enjoy them, too, even though they are not in color or HD.",1415491200,2,378,3.986842105263158
5317235,5,B009D1G9S4,Great old school TV series about the early days of scuba diving adventure.  Must see if you dive.  Lloyd Bridges is awesome as Mike Nelson.  Perfect for a binge watching weekend.,1415145600,,178,4.67741935483871

5317243,5,B009D1G9S4,Lloyd Bridges was a great actor and the show SEA HUNT reflected that fact. Very good story telling great drama as well as being educational all packed into a half hour format. People of all ages will enjoy this show at an outstandingly low price thanks to Amazon...,1400112000,,265,4.541666666666667
5317244,5,B009D1G9S4,I used to watch Sea Hunt growing up.  I loved this show and I still do.  It is the show that inspired me to learn Scuba Diving.,1399075200,,127,3.6666666666666665
5317245,5,B009D1G9S4,I started diving when this series came out.  It was great to be able to view what I grew up with.  Sea Hunt was responsible for making SCUBA diving so popular.  Would recommend this for anyone that would like to get a blast from the past.,1394928000,,238,4.130434782608695
5317246,5,B009D1G9S4,"Great old shows. These have been the best quality DVDs I have seen on this series. They appear to be from the original films. When I was 5 years old, LLoyd Bridges sent me 3 autographed promo photographs and I still treasure them to this day! He was a good influence on me. In fact, watching these shows as an adult, I recognize several places from my time in the Coast Guard. I am very glad they produced these.",1393459200,,412,4.227848101265823
5317247,4,B009D1G9S4,"What great fun it is to watch this DVD.  A bit outdated, but still an excellent look at a show that opened up diving, underwater adventure.  Certainly not the average TV show of the era.  A must if you don't need every show added to your collection.  Really a good selection of episodes.",1392940800,3,287,4.3584905660377355
5317248,5,B009D1G9S4,"I am loving sea hunt it is just as i remembered it, i wish i had more time just to sit and watch all of it. Thank You",1390435200,2,117,3.2142857142857144
5317249,4,B009D1G9S4,"First, you have to be an aficionado of  the classic TV shows on early television to fully appreciate this collection.  The quality of reproduction is excellent and of course, without commercials.  Each episode runs about 25 minutes, give or take.  I thoroughly enjoyed this, although I don't know the criteria used to select which episodes were included.  Being a certified diver myself I found some of the situations presented were hilarious, and ""dive specifications"" as well as various data on sea life are seriously out of date here.  But who can resist the gusto and perseverance of the hero, Mike Nelson, as he battles the elements, sea creatures, numerous bad guys/gals, and late 1950's dive equipment!  Lloyd Bridges does just fine, and is quite fit, in the starring role as action hero and narrator.  You have to allow for the relatively tame plots and abrupt endings that go along with early Television.  I say: Dive In-the Water's Fine!",1389225600,5,947,4.943037974683544
5317250,5,B009D1G9S4,The discs are well made and quality of programming well done. I would make a comment if there was anything wrong as I am a Video Technician and duplicator. There is nothing to complain about.,1384992000,3,191,4.485714285714286
5317251,5,B009D1G9S4,This was a show that was enjoyed by the whole family when I was growing up.  It even had acetion in undergroud water.  Lloyd Bridges was a good swimmer and actor for the show.  He must have enjoyed this work.,1382659200,2,208,4.15
5317252,5,B009D1G9S4,"At times my memory exceeds my expectations of this show, but I still would rather watch this classic show than any 'reality or talent' non scripted show currently force fed to us. I had to spend some time in hospital and bought this item to watch in small doses. Like the classic 'Lone Ranger' for example, these episodes are well written to entertain in a half hour, not based on modern concepts of realism. I would recommend this item for fans of this TV time period and something kids can watch without getting nightmares.",1382486400,3,525,4.595744680851064
5317253,5,B009D1G9S4,Best TV show when I was a kid.  Enjoying Sea Hunt in great quality picture and sound.  A must for Mike Nelson fans.  :-),1380931200,2,120,3.9166666666666665
5317254,5,B009D1G9S4,"I wrote several letters to a big corporation and finally, Sea Hunt is available on DVD.  I grew up reading Skin Diver magazine, which, for some reason, our local small town library in northern Minnesota, carried.  I read Skin Diver every month and loved the TV series.  I'm now a PADI Master Instructor and I was anxious to see how these shows would appear now.  The physics haven't changed and the theory is pretty spot on.  There wasn't a lot of special effects but these are still good shows.  I contemplated getting the entire series but his 24-hour marathon on 8 DVD's covers the many seasons this show aired.  Go ahead!  The quality is outstanding!",1378771200,3,654,4.626086956521739
5317255,5,B009D1G9S4,"This is a nice compilation of various episodes from all 4 seasons. Quality is great (from 35mm masters)with a few minor exceptions regarding minor contrast issues. Brings back loads of great old memories of childhood syndication on sat. mornings! These 64 episodes are a great way to own representation without getting all 4 seasons...either way, you can't go wrong with quality and affordability! Enjoy!",1376784000,,404,5.328125
5317256,5,B009D1G9S4,"Highly recommended ""sampler"" from the TV show SEA HUNT.  The prints have been remastered and are in MINT condition.  If you've never seen the show before, this boxed set is for you.  A+",1376006400,,185,4.545454545454546

5317258,5,B009D1G9S4,This was one of my dads favorite shows as a kid.  Got this for a stocking stuffer and he was shocked to see it again.  Great buy!,1373068800,,129,3.740740740740741
5317259,5,B009D1G9S4,I loved Sea Hunt when I was a child and enjoy it even more now.  It seems like somewhere through the years they forgot how to tell a good story.,1372636800,,144,3.8
5317260,5,B009D1G9S4,"However, this was a very good buy and am looking forward to sitting in front of the TV and enjoying this old time favorite all over again.  I am glad to see more and more of the classic TV shows becoming available.  Still have a few NAKED CITY shows to watch to.",1371686400,,262,4.019230769230769
5317261,4,B009D1G9S4,"Although I have waited to give this to him until today, Father's Day, I know that he will love it.  This show was one of his favorites from times gone by.",1371340800,,154,3.967741935483871

5317263,5,B009D1G9S4,"We enjoyed seeing these ""Sea Hunt"" DVDs with our grandchildren, and remembering that we watched them with our children years ago.  The quality is good and shipping was very fast.",1370649600,2,178,4.933333333333334
5317264,5,B009D1G9S4,"Sea Hunt inspired me to become a diver.  It's wonderful to sit down and enjoy good, clean entertainment that actually has a plot!",1369785600,2,129,4.608695652173913
5317265,4,B009D1G9S4,"I watched this show avidly as a teenager, my first exposure to SCUBA (called ""skin diving"", then).  So when it was offered for less than $20, I had to get it.

As a SCUBA diver of some 20 years experience, I now find countless examples of bad diving science and bad marine science in ""Sea Hunt"" episodes.  For example, Bernouli's principle states that the volume of a gas is the inverse of its pressure.  Since one atmosphere of pressure is added with every 33 feet of depth, at 100 feet underwater, a diver's air supply is 1/4 the volume of what it was at the surface, and therefore is used up four times as quickly.  The increased partial pressure of the breathing gas is also the source of the problem known as the ""bends"".  (Nitrogen under increased pressure [and decreased volume] is breathed in and some absorded into the blood stream and passed on to soft tissue.  As the diver ascends, the partial pressue decreases and the volume of the trapped nitrogen increases.  If the absorbed nitrogen exceeds the amount that can be ""off-gassed"" through normal breathing, the expanded nitrogen bubbles can cause neurological impingement or an arterial gas embolism.) Not for Mike Nelson, who's air lasts 46 minutes at any depth.  And forget oxygen toxicity at depths greater than 150', Mike dives well beyond that on regular air mixtures to depths of 200' or more with no problems.

Marine science?  Well Mike states that sharks are mindless killer, Killers Whales are too, and should be eradicated from the oceans (there is no documented case of a Killer Whale killing a human).  Moray eels spring from their lairs to strike divers,  Freshwater fish appear in Ocean shots (because the filming of those episodes was done in Florida freshwater springs), and on and on.

So is it bad dive and marine science?  Yes.  If you enjoyed the series 55 years ago will you enjoy it now?  Probably.  I did.

By the way, if you're sharp-eyed, you'll spot Leonard Nemoy in several episodes, probably some of his earliest TV work.",1369440000,2,2013,4.732758620689655
5317266,4,B009D1G9S4,"The late 50s and early 60s was an amazing time for television shows. Fewer main characters and plots that were shallow as wading pools. Many famous actors started their careers on Sea Hunt.  Sea Hunt has amazing underwater footage. Lloyd Bridges was in amazing shape for someone in his mid 40s. The only reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars is the audio levels jump to the point you want to increase the volume with the remote when actors are speaking and lower the volume during the theme music. Lloyd's underwater narrative is very good and adds to the drama.

5317268,4,B009D1G9S4,"The set is fun for a number of reasons.  A 30 minute drama series isn't really possible now because the commercials take up too much time.  The plots are simple and acheivable.  That's great when you have 30 minutes to kill and don't want anything serious.  The values and marks of progress are interesting - the introduction of how to make skin diving a safe sport is excellent.  A view into the technology of the era is oddly fascinating.  The general attitude toward women is, for the most part, a very 1950's point of view (glad that has changed).  Then, the viewer can see today's famous in yesterday's bit parts - Leonard Nemoy, Jeff Bridges, etc.  Lloyd Bridges certainly got himself a good show.  The marathon collection seems to present a good selection of the episodes.",1366934400,4,779,4.669117647058823

5317278,5,B009D1G9S4,"The 'Sea Hunt 24-Hour Television Marathon' (2012) offers 64 beautifully remastered black-and-white episodes of the classic American underwater adventure series which originally aired from 1958 through 1961.

The show's protagonist, ex-frogman and professional diver Mike Nelson (Lloyd Bridges), who is usually employed by Marineland of the Pacific, is an archetypal mid-century American male hero, embodying a period when the country still prized physically strong, well-educated, capable, responsible and ethical men as leaders in all areas of life.

Nelson is shown to be respected wherever he goes; his reputation proceeds him not only in the United States, but also in other countries of the Western hemisphere.

As such, Nelson (and, by extension, Bridges) represents the iconic male figure which would disappear almost completely from the landscape with the cultural revolution of the late 1960s, rarely, if ever, to return, and certainly never to appear again in so definite a form.

This heroic, can-do, and essentially conservative American male figure was found, with variation, in many other pre-1970s television series, from Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) on 'Rawhide' (1959-1966), Capt. Grey Holden (Darren McGavin) on 'Riverboat' (1959-1961), Capt. Adam Troy (Gardner McKay) on 'Adventures in Paradise' (1959-1962) and James Drury as the title character on 'The Virginian' (1962-1971) to Porter Ricks (Brian Kelly) on 'Flipper' (1964-1967) and Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) on 'Star Trek'  (1966-1969), among others.

'Sea Hunt' consisted of an unusual mix of elements: the spartan black-and-white photography blended perfectly with the no-nonsense, documentary-style adventure stories narrated by Nelson, but the program also had a highly romanticized and dramatic opening theme, which suggested another, more mysterious dimension to the proceedings entirely.

The straight-forward scripts presented Nelson as a highly effective professional man existing on a strictly earthly plane; the theme song, however, suggested Nelson was a transcendent archetypal hero of the first order, capable of shooting an arrow into the void and hitting his target.

Interestingly, many episodes closed with a short segment in which Bridges, appearing as himself in nautical gear on a boat (and thus looking exactly like Mike Nelson), warned audiences to always take caution when venturing onto or under the water. Caution, in fact, is stressed repeatedly throughout every episode.

As might be expected, and as with other American television dramas of the era such as '77 Sunset Strip' (1958-1964) and 'Route 66' (1960-1964), the social landscape of 'Sea Hunt' was traditional.

Gender roles were sharply defined, with the males, led by Nelson, being athletic, fit, and typically under fifty years of age (Bridges was, in fact, forty-five years old when the series began), while the female characters, though usually depicted as high achievers and as physically and intellectually capable as the men, are often ""bathing beauty"" types shy of thirty-five. Attractive, long-bodied WASPs of both sexes predominate.

Nelson is a bachelor, who, when not working, calmly smokes a pipe at home while reading a book, classical music playing in the background. Out of his wetsuit, spending an afternoon in his suave and well-furnished waterfront apartment, Nelson is a dignified and cultured gentleman. Though he is clearly physically and romantically interested in women, those episodes which feature Nelson dating a new acquaintance or ""old flame"" are flat and unconvincing, as if the writers felt compelled to reestablish Nelson's heterosexuality from time to time, but in fact had no genuine interest in illuminating that part of his life.

The 'realistic' plots are varied, though the intrepid Nelson finds himself and his diving associates challenged by danger in every episode, usually while underwater.

Human nature is presented in 60/40 terms throughout the series, with High Anglo manners predominating. Despite a cheerful, stable persona, 'Sea Hunt' suggests that well-concealed deceit, jealously, envy, greed or an ugly competitive spirit may erupt in any individual, causing him or her to throw all reason to the wind, or to actively attempt to sabotage others.

Nelson, even after being attacked underwater by a speargun-toting comrade who has suddenly revealed himself to be an enemy, typically exemplifies the concept of 'grace under pressure,' defeating his foe after a protracted struggle, then hauling him to the surface, where the miscreant is turned over to the Coast Guard or other authorities.

Nelson rarely panics or loses control of his emotions; it seems that almost no act, no matter how petty, evil or depraved, can rouse him to anger. In this specific aspect, the unflappable Nelson is not a little like George Reeves as the title character in 'The Adventures of Superman' (1952-1958).

As might be expected from its Cold War period, quite a few episodes deal with political subversion, spying, willful acts of treason, ""secret new explosives,"" and ""top secret underwater rocket launchers.""

In keeping with making the most of the show's theme and spectacular underwater photography, other episodes feature rogue alligators in the Florida Everglades (which Nelson, Tarzan-like, unhesitantly grapples with when it endangers others), a man-eating killer whale off the northern California coast (which actually eats one of Nelson's friends in an unusual turn of events for the show), sea snakes in the Amazon, sharks, reports of ""sea serpents"" (which Nelson believes may exist ""in the deep ocean trenches"") and local legends of seductive singing mermaids who lure men to their deaths.

The predominantly stoic and never-bettered 'Sea Hunt' can be appreciated by audiences of all ages; its stark underwater photography still holds its power and magic all these decades later.

Secondary players include Larry Hagman, Peter Breck, Ross Martin, Herbert Anderson, and Leonard Nimoy before each found television fame.",1361145600,17,6032,5.558342420937841
5317279,5,B009D1G9S4,"Before receiving this collection, I tried to search online to see which episodes were included (to no avail).  Each of the four seasons is 39 episodes, except the fourth which is 38 episodes.  This collection is 64 out of the 155 episodes, featuring Season 1 (22 of 39), Season 2 (10 of 39), Season 3 (11 of 39) and Season 4 (21 of 38).  I do not intend to list the episodes as I don't have time to type 64 episode titles, but hopefully the manufacturer will do that at some stage.

As to video quality, it appears pretty good for its age. Unfortunately, there are no extras, but I am just grateful to have these episodes released and in such good condition.  There is a chapter stop in each episode after the opening titles (good) but none after that during the episode(not so good). The collection comes with four 2 DVD cases, housing the 8 discs.  Some of the discs were loose on arrival but hopefully they have not been damaged (I have not watched all episodes yet).

For someone wishing to get 40% of the whole series for around twenty bucks, in my view this collection represents great value and is recommended.  If you buy this, get sucked in and then decide to get the whole series (each season is to be released separately), then there will be some doubling up, although less so with Season 2 and 3 which only have about one quarter of their respective seasons. If you think you might like the lot, you could dip your toe in the water by buying the first season.  Decisions, decisions....",1360800000,27,1497,4.434306569343065

5317293,5,B009D1G9S4,"TGG Direct recently signed an agreement with MGM-TV to issue DVD collections of two of the most popular ZIV-produced programs of the 1950s - ""Bat Masterson"" and ""Sea Hunt."" We were originally told that full-season sets of both shows would be offered before the end of 2012, but as of this writing 62-episode general collections of both series are the only two that have actually been made available. I have purchased both sets, have viewed numerous episodes from both, and I recommend both sets enthusiastically for any fan of either series.  The ""Sea Hunt"" set is identical to the ""Bat Masterson"" set in that the episodes are uncut and were evidently digitized from properly-preserved 35mm master prints. The audio and video quality are exceptional for the ages of the shows. The collections include 8 discs in four boxes and the menus are very user-friendly. Both sets represent exceptional value for the price and would be very worthwhile additions to any classic TV lover's collection.  As a longtime fan of all of the ZIV shows, I am hopeful that TGG Direct's MGM-TV licensing agreement will result in further releases of high-quality DVD collections from the ZIV library.",1356652800,8,1177,5.0

5317295,5,B009D1G9S4,"I tried to obtain this series last year through Amazon but could not obtain it as the series was sold locally only, so I was amazed when, by a fluke, I came upon this boxset.

I have never seen Sea Hunt since it was on TV in the 1960s, and yet it has been glued in my mind all this time.

This is a half-hour series about Mike Nelson (Llyod Bridges, father of the Bridges boys), an ex-navy frogman turned freelance scuba diver who rescues trapped people from a watery grave. He also takes on villains, and anything else including a nuclear missile.

Each episode Llyod Bridges provided a voice over narration as he could not speak under water at the time of filming. Sea Hunt brought a different kind of adventure to the television screen each week that created a craving as one could not get enough of it.

As with most of the shows of the time, they did not get some of the facts right, but all was forgiven as the shows were exciting, different and new to television. As one case (Sixty Feet Down shows) - Nelson is saving a pilot and has 15 minutes to save him. He has to resurface twice from sixty feet to get tools and still rescue the pilot. I am not a mathematician, but it doesn't add up to me, then there are other troubles to contend with.

Sea Hunt was, I think, the first to bring awareness to the plight of the marine environment, as pleas to understand and protect the oceans. It also was first to bring people to the recreational sport of scuba diving at a time when didn't know much about it.

This 24 Hour boxset is definitely a must have for anyone interested in old TV series or just scuba diving. Although the series is coming out in January 2013, the set has 64 episodes to sate anyone's craving for underwater adventure, and gets five stars from me as I have been waiting tooooo long to see the show again.",1356220800,8,1829,4.28695652173913

5317297,5,B009D1G9S4,"There is no other offering of Sea Hunt that matches the quality of this set - 24 Hour Marathon.  Where it particularly shines is in the underwater photography where in other sets I have owned it come across murky because of poor reproduction.  Lloyd Bridges was a fine dramatic actor and most of his career he played dramatic roles until the later part of his career.  Good value, great quality, but clunky packaging.  The set does breaks down into four standard slipcases for easier storage.

This early series intelligently incorporated science and technology into its plots.  Good to see quality releases like this from the Golden Age of Television.",1355011200,26,652,4.935779816513762
5317298,5,B009D1G9S4,"SEA HUNT was the most successful of producer Ivan Tors ""techno-ventures"" produced for TV in the late '50s/early '60s.  These were engaging, half-hour semi-documentaries about survival in challenging environments, whether under the sea (as with this series, which introduced always-enjoyable Lloyd Bridges to TV audiences), in the air (THE MAN AND THE CHALLENGE) or even in outer space (MEN INTO SPACE).  Apart from the pleasures of the show itself, I'm delighted to report that the transfer quality of these episodes is nothing short of spectacular; they appear to be mastered directly from the 35mm negatives, and the odds are most viewers have never seen SEA HUNT looking quite this good.  Although TGG has announced season-by-season releases of the TV series in their ""Marathon"" program, this attractive box set provides an excellent value and might get the job done right now -- it  contains over 60 episodes with the pilot and a good deal of Season One included.
