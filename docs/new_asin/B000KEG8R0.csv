8155827,5,B000KEG8R0,"This DVD is a peek inside the mind of a creative, musical genius.  His ideas are valid but not for the typical, ""let me steal your licks!"" crowd.  As an educated, professional musician I understand what he is saying and it is a great reminder of how if you understand music, you can tap into your own individual creativity as an improviser.  There are no licks to steal...just a well-rounded discussion of his ""method"" for making any tune his own.  Highly recommended!",1380067200,2,468,4.670731707317073
8155828,4,B000KEG8R0,"This is about the artistry of BF.  OK?  This isn't the licks of BF or how to play like BF. As he shows, the fretboard can be a wonderfully complex instrument with endless opportunities (and equally frustrating without his mastery--my comment). It is a wonderful insight to how he improvises, plays, his use of effects and his general thoughts about playing with a band and the importance (to him, and thus to all us mortals as well) of melody and several examples of the use of melody as a template for his improvisational approach.  I've seen him live and I have several CD starting from around the 80s.  He has a distinct voice on the guitar and this DVD captures his style and approaches quite well.  You can't teach improvisation in a 60-90 DVD.  I will also add that this is earlier  Frisell -- his more recent music (around Nashville era) and later are, in general, more melodic and, perhaps, a little less out there in the way that some of the tunes and examples on this DVD.  I really liked it and will do my best to try some of his ideas to improve my playing.",1250294400,5,1069,4.3908629441624365
8155829,5,B000KEG8R0,"There can only be one Bill Frisell. After buying 9 of his CD's and finally seeing him live, I bought this DVD. It is a wonderful journey into Bill Frisell and his music. It's not a ""How To"" DVD but a look into his creativity. My wife didn't know his music until I dragged her to the show. Now she's a big fan and she also loved watching the DVD. I will always buy anything he puts out.",1187049600,2,385,3.948717948717949
8155830,1,B000KEG8R0,"My assumption at this point is that Bill was asked very politely to do an instructional video ($$$ also helps) and Bill being the nice guy he is, he said yes.

If you keep that in mind when you're watching this, then this DVD will make sense other than that this DVD is a waste of perfectly good tape.

Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Frisell fan, but the guy can't teach. In fact, why should he? He doesn't need to, he's Bill Frisell. Geniuses like Frisell should never explain anything to anyone. He definitely shouldn't explain how he approaches the guitar.

Doing ""instructional"" videos seems like it's becoming a trend for jazz guitarists. The next thing you know Pat Metheny will be putting out his video. Mike Stern, John Scofield, and John Abercrombie already have some of theirs out. Why do these players think they can teach somebody their own concepts about making music and playing the guitar? It's insane! It's bad enough some of these players have books out that analyze their own compositions. If that wasn't enough to drive you crazy, then how about watching them on a DVD?

With all due respect to Frisell, he should NEVER do another one of these videos again.

This DVD is just for the serious Frisell collector. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone learning how to play the guitar or wanting to learn more about it.",1186704000,6,1329,4.590717299578059
