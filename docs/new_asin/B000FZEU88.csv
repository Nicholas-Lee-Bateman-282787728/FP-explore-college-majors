2594507,4,B000FZEU88,"This DVD is a partial portrayal of the mystical, energetic life spent with us, that of Pope JP II, Pope of the Roman Catholic Church since 1978, is displayed as the listener is treated to the magnificent, classic audio selections of Andrea Bocelli. A delightful combination, yet sad.

The life of John Paul II is not completely summarized in this effort, but rather, his time spent with us as the unequalled pope, in our desperate times, is summarized. The intention is to give one hope as this suffering human is seen centering all he humbly does in vignettes attibuting his prayer, actions, travels, interactions as those springing from love which originates in Jesus Christ Himself.

The continual reference to scenes of those mourning his loss, felt by the 3 million attendees of his wake, center the soul on the one who is no longer visible from the window from which I have seen him so often.

He is no longer with us who loved him so much.

These chapters are filled with the ventures of a figure of Christ Himself; not of John Paul the man. He lived the intended life of Christ while with us. Let us not lose sight of his love for the most powerless, the most down-trodden, and the children, whose little faces are obvious in almost every scene.

Now that his cause for beatification is being more urgently scrutinized we are reminded of the wonderful intercessor we have sitting at the Feet of Jesus, begging the Blessed Mother to hold back The Arm of Christ, the effects of that arm which we deserve.

The English subtitles are not optimal, some words are not of correct English grammar/spelling, but, the intense love is expressed in the wonderful cuts from the Vatican Archives and embellished by the most admired tenor of our generation, Andrea Bocelli. Who else to sing to my heart as tears flow down my face, realizing the loss we have experienced without our friend's Polish smile, and quiet, intense piety, which have evolved from a life of suffering and loss. This artform helps to reflect the supernatural clarity and strength of the human condition, which we seem to lose sight of belonging to; It seems that ""it (the world) is all about us"", after all.

This effort did well to portray that goal, to take me out of my box and force me to extend myself to others to try to emulate the example we lost on that day in 2005. I will miss my friend, but, I am hopeful, only for a little while.",1175385600,12,2408,4.573085846867749
2594508,5,B000FZEU88,Very touching to see this pope with the children. He was truly the people pope. The footage of him outside the vatican and the music of Andrea Bocelli was a perfect marriage. I view this often. Good for small group discussion about the Pope following the teacing of Christ. Only One John Paul And Mother Teresa.,1167782400,27,311,4.571428571428571

8127954,5,B000FZEU88,"This film is a deeply affecting montage of Pope John Paul II footage accompanied by the blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing beautiful sacred arias from the Catholic musical tradition. Bocelli has the purest voice of any tenor I've heard (his live concerts are better than any recording) and it's well suited to the images presented here. The film begins with footage from John Paul II's wake and funeral in 2005, then proceeds to incorporate old footage while constantly cutting back to the funeral, with the music (joyful, tragic, sad) perfectly matching the images. Much of the footage here has been seen before, such as the assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square in 1981 and the pope's 1983 visit to the gunman who shot him, but rarely has it presented with such emotional impact. The film has a requiem-like style and is unabashedly sentimental, but it works better than many documentaries on John Paul II because it tells his story through images rather than analysis, giving us the words and images of the man himself rather than talking heads interspersed with scant footage. I've seen a lot of documentaries on John Paul II and this film is the best at covering his entire life from birth to death even though it presumes some prior knowledge of the 20th century's greatest pope. The ""Witness to Hope"" film of George Weigel's book might give you more details of his life, but it ends in 2003 two years before his death, and it fails to move the heart quite like this one.",1382227200,,1491,4.760617760617761
8127955,4,B000FZEU88,"Great archive footage, great music and a great voice. Simply unforgettable, even for non believers. What else should I say?",1382227200,,123,5.2

8127957,3,B000FZEU88,I cannot review this CD at this time because the CD cannot be played.  I am returning it to Amazon for a working one.,1325980800,,117,3.875
8127958,1,B000FZEU88,"On the back of the dvd it reads: ""Credo: A movie on John Paul II - His Life.""

First of all, this is not a movie, and does not say anything about his life. This is just one hour of footage from his funeral, intermixed with 5-10 second clips from his visits to places around the world - mostly just him waving his arm hello, or reciting prayers or giving speeches.

It is not presented chronologically, there is no story line or narrative, and it would not help you understand who is was, what he stood for, and what he even did with his time on this earth, except for be the pope, wave to an audience and give a few speeches.

Not a movie but a video scrapbook. May be interesting for people not interested in learning about him, but simply watching him, dead and alive.",1281916800,5,770,4.224489795918367
8127959,5,B000FZEU88,"First of all, I will state I am a devote Roman Catholic who loved and deeply admired Pope John Paul II.  I had admired and loved him from the day he was elected Pope.  I was glued to the TV at the time of his death, even now I miss him greatly as he had such great charisma with all people.  So to hear of this DVD, that I did not know existed and to find out my most beloved opera/pop singer was the voice behind the scenes of Blessed John Paul's life and death, it was a must have for me.  I certainly was not disappointed.  I just sit and listen and the tears run down my face from the absolute beauty of voice mixed with pictures.  The voice of Mr. Bocelli is so beautiful, and combined with the images it just about takes my breath away.  Whoever did the synchronization of this DVD with the pictures of the Pope's funeral  and reflections of his life mixed with the unmistakable voice of the Master, Andrea Bocelli is a real genius.  It is so well done, so respectful and so well choreographed, this is a masterpiece; a work of art. This is worth so much more then money can express.  No matter what the album the voice of Mr. Bocelli goes right through me, and it just stirs something deep with in me that is close to a deeply religious experience.  Buy this today!! I want to thank Amazon.com as they recommended this DVD to me, a great recommendation.",1272844800,6,1360,4.212355212355212
