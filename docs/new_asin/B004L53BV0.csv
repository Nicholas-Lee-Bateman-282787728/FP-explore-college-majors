8750937,5,B004L53BV0,"SEASON OF THE WITCH is a well-made, very foreboding medieval era story that opens with Crusade-inspired chaos and war atrocities, then quickly segues to a bizarrely dark road picture in which AWOL soldiers Behmen (Cage) and Felson (Perlman) (he of the very long face) are captured then charged with delivering to a remote monastery a young woman (Foy) believed to be a witch. She's also accused of starting the Bubonic Plague.

The Girl's super-human strength and several inexplicable events she seems to initiate with her mind can only mean this unfortunate is actually possessed by Satan, but our heroes don't learn that until after they reach the devil's desired destination, and then all you-know-what breaks loose.

The grueling exorcism sequence that follows is not to be believed! See this one late at night.. IF YOU DARE!
