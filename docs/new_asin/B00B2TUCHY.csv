5553786,5,B00B2TUCHY,"You know has a tremendous manga, just from watching episodes. But you don't have to read the manga to enjoy this.

This is one of the most enjoyable and silly shows you'll likely see in anime. The characters support each other very well and the comedy they create is fantastic. Some of the gags are rather old ones seen in anime but for some reason this show makes them funny again.

The one fault with this show is it doesn't go into the backstory for Tsukimi. You see it in the opening theme and it shows that she isn't really human anymore but you will wonder about her and it just won't be answered. Turning to the manga is likely the remedy to this. But again, you don't need to read it to enjoy this. This is a slice of life comedy where each episode pretty much stands on it's own. The story feels like it takes place in the middle of where the grand story is in the manga but it is not hard to pick up or get into. You get to know the characters easily.

Overall there is a lot to enjoy in Place to Place. You'll have some questions but you don't feel like it is hurting the show by them not really answering them. Its just an endearing, silly, and cute little series. Check it out!",1361577600,8,1190,4.142857142857143

5553788,2,B00B2TUCHY,"Probably going to be axed because of this review, but here we go.

Place to Place is a show I thought I would enjoy. I love romance, I love gag comedy and I love cuteness. This did not deliver. Most of the jokes were bad puns, the releationship between the main characters always got interrupted because of their friends and everything that happened is stuff we have seen in thousands of other Anime series. Every character was one dimensional, besides the mains. A bunch of bad-spirited jokes as well, such as people calling other ugly for no good reason at all and other namecalling you would often hear in middle school. I feel like the show would have been a lot better if the focus was put on the main characters, instead of everyone just hanging out and doing standard activities all the time. Snowball fights, working, going on short trips, skating, valentines day, Io says something that arouses the girls and makes them bleed all the time, discussions about nothing leading to nowhere and the such.

If you want a series that does this better, look for ""Ai Yori Aoshi"". He's sorrounded by friends, but there's plenty of scenes that builds on the main character's releationship.",1449964800,2,1186,4.72463768115942
5553789,5,B00B2TUCHY,Tsumiki for the win! I love this anime it's one of my favorites and I was so thrilled to see it on Blu-Ray! This is a family friendly anime and everyone in the house enjoys it!,1447718400,,176,3.9166666666666665

5553796,5,B00B2TUCHY,"Seriously folks, this anime has to be the most Moe anime ever created to date. I'm not joking here, there were so many points in this anime where I was all DWAAAA~ or AWWWWW~ and even HNNNGGGGGG~  I was very sad when it came to an end, I really hope this anime gets a second season! *crosses fingers*

This anime is two things. One: Comedy. Two: Momance. (Moe + Romance, clever huh?) There is no drama or darkness to this anime, if I had to use words to describe it would be Fluffy and Delightful; much like cotton candy. The comedy comes in a few forms, the top being language play, jabs, and set-ups. And unlike some comedy, you will laugh at all the funny bits.

Animation was by Anime International Company, who have also done titles such as: Sora no Otoshimono: Forte, Nyan Koi!, and Ah! My Goddess. Although I would say it is more Chibi like then the usual animation they do, but not Chibi enough that I feel like I'm watching an episode of Pocket Monsters animated. If you have ever seen Lucky Star, thats what it looks like. (kinda)

Surprisingly for such a light hearted and cute anime, the voice acting was quite good. The guys who played Io (Nobuhiko Okamoto) really worked as a heart throb voice. His voice seemed to parallel Tsumiki's (Rumi Okubo) voice perfectly.

This anime also has re-playability, much like seitokai yakuindomo or seitokai no ichizon.

All around good buy.",1407369600,,103,5.5
5553799,5,B00B2TUCHY,The replay factor for this anime is quite high for me. Since i watched it so many times i can leave it on and go about my business on projects and assignments.,1406851200,,159,4.0
5553800,5,B00B2TUCHY,"This has to be one of my favorite animes of all time. It is absolutely hilarious and sweet; the characters are absolutely wonderful. Place to Place (Acchi Kocchi) focuses on a group of friends. Tsumiki is small, abnormally strong, and has many of the characteristics of a tsundere. She is head over heels in love with Io; everyone knows that except Io, who seems to be pretty dense when it comes to that. He seems to have some kind of special feelings for Tsumiki, but doesn't seem to realize that he does. (Not that I don't like Io. He is a sweet, thoughtful, intelligent, and talented guy). Mayoi and Sakai are loveable tricksters who bring a wonderful element of humor to the show (they often end up being used to bring some slapstick humor in as well). The main group is complete with Hime, a sweet, innocent girl that I just love to pieces.
Some might complain that this doesn't have much of a plot and in a sense it doesn't; the characters are not on some quest or working towards any particular goal, but that is one of the things I love about it. I can relax when I watch it; I don't have to worry about the characters getting hurt. I can just laugh at their antics as they live their relatively normal high school lives.
If you enjoyed this anime, here is a list of other anime I enjoyed and you may possibly like as well: Maid Sama, Kamisama Kiss, Fruits Basket, Special A, Skip Beat!, Cuticle Tantei Inaba, Ouran High School Host Club,  Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok, Okami-san and her Seven Companions, Princess Jellyfish, Aria the Scarlet Ammo, The Wallflower, Psychic Detective Yakumo, Kaze No Stigma, Earl and Fairy, Free!, Gosick, Toradora, and so on. (Warning: My taste in anime is a little eclectic, so you may not like all of them- hopefully you'll find a few treasures). If you have any questions or anime suggestions for me, feel free to comment. :)
*On the product itself: I really liked this set. It came in a case the size of any normal dvd case. There are three discs with cute designs. There are English subtitles and Japanese audio. This set includes all thirteen episodes. If you enjoy the show, it is definitely worth the price.",1397347200,4,2160,4.552699228791774
5553801,5,B00B2TUCHY,"Disclaimer: I'm commenting on the series, not the actual product here. I love this series; it's a great romantic comedy. My interpretation is it's the every day high school life of kids with superhuman powers... well, most of them anyway. From sweet romance to hilarious over the top humor, I highly recommend it!",1386806400,,313,4.9245283018867925

Like luky star and k-on, this is a great 4-panel manga that have beeen turned into a briliant anime, a must watch for those who love comedy...",1378771200,,191,4.162162162162162
5553804,5,B00B2TUCHY,"Outrageous comedy with awkward-lovely overtones. Based on Yonkoma (four panel) style manga.
Speculative genre: Romance for Dudes. (slapstick included)
Downside: Needs a season two for sure and I didn't care for the very last episode.
As for the item itself-it arrived clean & in mint condition.
Overall, I highly recommend you add this to your animated collection.",1374019200,,364,5.4035087719298245
5553805,4,B00B2TUCHY,"This is the most recent romantic comedy that I really enjoy watching it that I watched it over again a few more times, which I rarely do that as most animes I don't find enough enjoyment to watch it again. If you enjoy lighthearted anime especially if you like Lucky Star then this is a must watched, most of the characters especially all the female characters are very interesting in their own way which bought a lot of comedic moments. The only disappointment for me is that Sentai Filmworks didn't bother to dubbed it over for the US release otherwise this would have been an excellent collection. I really hope some point in the future they will reissue this title with English dub just like they did for ""Special A"" which is also one of my favorite romantic comedy anime.",1371772800,4,776,4.55

I was really impressed with the quality of the graphics, the pace of the show, and the humor that was perfectly placed. I love the story itself, and enjoy rewatching this anime l. I would immediately lend this anime to someone who is looking for a good anime. Although I would not really lend it to them, but just give them a peek.",1485043200,,427,4.283950617283951

8561808,4,B00B2TUCHY,"My biggest complaint is that a second season doesn't exist for this anime! As it stands, the dvd came like new and the discs all play well in my computer. I am a little bit disappointed that the sub-titles are a bit odd. When I watched the episodes on youtube they used subtitles that were white text with a blue-ish tinged outline that fit the show exactly and were down far enough on the screen so as not to block any of the show. For whatever reason the subtitles in these dvds is the big yellow text and it sits higher on the screen, sometimes getting in the way of what's happening. But that's only a minor complaint and otherwise this is absolutely perfect!",1467504000,,663,4.354838709677419
