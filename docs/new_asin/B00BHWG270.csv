5622293,5,B00BHWG270,"We have all of the Dead's official concert dvds, and quite a few unofficial ones too, but this one has always been my personal favourite, and I think it's one of the very best they ever did.

It is a recording of a concert from Summer 1989 at Rich Stadium, New York. The recording is well over two hours long. Sound and picture quality are excellent, and the Band is on top form throughout. Tracks include 'Deal', 'Touch of Grey', 'Ship of Fools' and many others. A full list of all of the tracks has kindly been provided by an earlier reviewer.

There are two reasons why I like this dvd so much. Firstly, I think that the track selection is about as good as you could get, pretty much from start to finish. But the main reason is the performances. This is a concert where every single member of the band just seems to be on fire and up for it. The individual performances are terrific, and the way they  meshed together as a unit on nights like this is just a unique feature of the Grateful Dead.

 If you like the Grateful Dead, you will like this.",1386374400,15,1051,4.261306532663316

5622298,4,B00BHWG270,The music was on fire.  It was one of those shows that seemed to flow. The camera work was not great though. It seemed like they cycled through different camera angles in the same order as if on a timer.,1447977600,2,203,4.075

5622302,5,B00BHWG270,"Good stuff. Add it to your library today.
One really neat thing about many of these GD concert videos, and true of this one, you can opt to have the lyrics captioned. Now that, that my good sir, is just super for the lover or newcomer. That's deluxe in my book.
Far as the resolution quality, well we have all been spoiled by HD these days, so there you will see a difference, particularly on the far away shots. It would be cool if it had been, dare I say like a video of today of yesterday, but then you never know.
Still, you love them, you will love this. Simple math. Well, logic, too.",1425254400,10,590,4.139130434782609
5622303,5,B00BHWG270,probably the best Grateful Dead video I have ever seen. I own 5 other concert DVDs and this is by far the best . the sound and the video R very tight,1424131200,4,149,3.6875

8568786,4,B00BHWG270,"I was at this show and it was great to find it on DVD. Normally I would give it 5 stars, a fantastic performance. But, even though I was probably on acid when I was at the concert, I didn't need the producers of this video to turn the drum solo into an acid flashback. The guys played numerous percussion instruments and it would have been great to see what each one was, but the video people turned it into some wacky 70s kaleidoscope video that was tough to watch. Even though its in the title of the disc, The Dead didn't play Truckin at this show.",1514592000,,551,4.158878504672897
