7961123,5,B000065LHO,"Unlike some of the previous detractors of this production, I find this video set to be excellent. The accent of the presenter is somewhat of a challenge, but only in an insignificant way. By knowing something about insects after years of being fascinated by these creatures, I'm able to infer what he is saying, and in between what he says I concentrate on the insects, their environment and the bigger picture.

Even if one is completely naive about the insect world, no one can fail to marvel at the beauty and the variety of the class Insecta as shown, their metamorphosis, and their ecological importance. The segments on the use of insects for adornment, their use in helping forensic specialist to solve crimes, and their medicinal benefits are additional attractions that make this video production well worth the purchase.",1437868800,,830,4.971223021582734
7961124,5,B000065LHO,"I enjoy these videos very much; George Broussard takes his pupils on an expedition into a much larger world than us humans recognized in our daily routines!
And how we should really be more conscience of the little ones around us that very often get discredited for whatever superstitions we obsess about as being either creepy or in the way.
These videos are a real treat for many facets our many societies!",1185494400,2,408,4.680555555555555
7961125,5,B000065LHO,"Some here have dinged this series for its presentation of traditional practices which may be seen as barbaric.  Others have dinged it for its lack of scientific information.  The fact remains however that there is little material available which presents the phylum Insecta in a favorable or at least non-terrifying light.  What ""Insectia"" lacks in scientific detail it certainly makes up for in abundance of high quality footage.  The narrator is passionate and affable.

What has been described as the depiction of ""cruel practices"" by certain other reviewers is simply the objective presentation of the role that insects play in various cultures around the world.  To deny their importance in these respects is to discard their importance to us historically, mythologically, and culturally.

In the end, this series might disappoint serious entomologists, but they'll certainly delight their children.  The series is overflowing with footage I've never seen elsewhere, presented in a captivating manner that I can't wait to force upon my nieces and nephews (and eventually my own children).  No one should be horrified by insects, and if anything, this series will ensure that.",1171238400,5,1180,5.369565217391305
7961126,1,B000065LHO,"Zero stars. This is NOT a nature video. My daughters and I were disgusted. The commentator gives us a tour of cruel practices, including the use of beautiful dead insects for jewelry (and living beetles with glued rhinestones on their backs chained to safety pins). Instead of the wonder of the life of insects, we are taken to examine the harvested dried insects in the jars of a Chinese herbalist.

The insects are not respected in this film.

We see the narrator eat lemon ants. He captures a horned beetle in one scene and kills it and places it in a white box. All the while he has a disgusting conspiratorial look on his face.

The box IS beautiful. We threw away the DVDs.",1128988800,3,679,4.459677419354839
7961127,5,B000065LHO,"My husband and I have enjoyed several of these episodes.  The sound and lighting are always professonally done.  The transition from insect to insect is smooth and keeps it from getting tedious.  Georges Brossard as the narrator is always intense, but sometimes quiet and sometimes loud.  Every episode has kept our complete attention.  I can't take my eyes off the screen.
Georges Brossard left his job as an attorney to travel around the world and pursue his interest in insects.  He was responsible for the creation of the Montreal Insectarium and has been mandated by the Audobon Organization to create an insectarium in New Orleans.  (The Insectia web page has more information.) His vision is to make insects interesting to everyday people, including children.  I think he is succeeding.",1069200000,19,793,5.093023255813954
7961128,2,B000065LHO,"When I purchased this DVD I was expecting to watch a documentary the level of BBC or National Geographic. Unfortunately the scientific informations provided by this video scarcely fill one disc and the remaining topics in other 3 discs are only about curiosities, popular beliefs, ancient legends and bugs being used as medicine and food. Differently from David Attenborough's serious documentaries where his interference is minimun and necessary, the presence of Georges Brossard (a mixture of actor, clown and ontologist) is annoying. He wishes to be the star of the show more than the insects. Unbelievably, even the scientfic informations provided by him are limited and not new: The only insects' way-of-life he focus in detail are ants and termites but all of these informations can be found in documentaries not specialized in insects such as BBC's The Life of Plants and Trials of Life. The two stars go to some beautiful closes on insects and that's all.",1033430400,24,963,5.10126582278481
7961129,5,B000065LHO,"I bought this dvd collection for my 7yr old son who is totally infatuated with anything in nature. I was not disappointed. Brossard takes us along with him on a trek that spans most of the globe and shows us insects in all their variety and splendor. He draws enough connections between man and insect to make me wonder who is the superior species. By the end of the last dvd (which comes with bloopers) my son wanted to go running off to the amazon rain forest and even I, who shudder at anything with more than four legs, would be willing to reconsider a camping trip. Well worth the money...for anyone who loves ""bugs"" or knows someone who does.",1026345600,17,648,4.408333333333333
