8663883,3,B00L5PDDIU,"I've met Tobe before at one of his other premiere's. We are weekender's in upstate NY and we support anything cultural like the GCCA and Cole House, Beattie  Powers house, and our new favorite is Bridge Street Theater.
I digress. Those are shameless endorsements!

I love trains and this DVD is packed with lots of interviews of local historians, and is written for local history buffs in the Catskill/Greene County and surrounding counties, almost so that the video does get a tad too deep into the subject. I am a big fan of Catskill Mountain House and have hiked up there for years. I only made it half way through the video so far, with barely a mention of CMH and the Otis. I'll give it more time during the winter.
Tobe Carey is right up there with historical contacts that remember many trains in the film. Roger Bobley in Margaretville is another local-yokel film-maker that deserves mention.

Ii am an Emmy award winning videographer and covered Mt. St. Helens from day one in 1980, and I truly appreciate what can be done in editing/video the last few years. I love local history and even though we've only been in Cairo 11 years, we'll retire there.
The history of all the different gauge trains used during the early times is simply amazing and Kobe has captured the complexity of them all.

I purchased my copy, because I always support the artist. I believe you can locate this in the Hudson Valley library system as an alternative...
Keep making films, Kobe! I hear that the train depot in Cairo is getting a re-visit. I have postcards of that era. The only reason for three stars is that I haven't seen the entire film yet, not like TV hosts that purportedly have seen the films.
