8164870,5,B000LXGVPY,"This is one of the cutest Bollywood Love story I have ever seen. Keep a box of tissues with you just in case if you are the emotional type because
this movie is high on emotions. Music was icing on the cake, All tracks were amazing. Girl was new so her acting wasn't great but still she managed to pull it off. Story, acting, direction, and Picturized was breathtaking. Watch it with partner and you can thank me later.",1428537600,,419,4.3164556962025316
8164871,3,B000LXGVPY,"This is the story of young love (Bobby Deol and Neha). He keeps lying to her and getting caught up in his lies. Neha then refuses to marry him and flees. Without giving the plot away Bobby's character keeps stealing (though for humanitarian purposes) Will the couple get together? Will he see the light?..
This is a Bollywood romance/melodrama from 1998. It starts brightly and the cinematography is goo. I generally like Bobby Deol and he and Neha play their parts well. However we found it a bit repetitive as he keeps the cheating up and it seemed a bit lacklustre. For us the songs weren't that notable either. We found ourselves losing interest even in the romance even though the leads were charming enough.
In fairness to buyers I should point out that our reactions aren't necessarily typical. Some people think this is wonderful and touching and on IMDb it was sitting at about 7 out of 10 from 145 votes, and Indian site reviews polarized between 'wonderful romance' and 'nothing but good cinematography and music score'. We didn't find this a keeper but for many it is a favorite.",1243641600,,1091,4.717277486910994
