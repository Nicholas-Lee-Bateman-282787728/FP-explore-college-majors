8301314,3,B001CY5N3M,"I have been running a Safety Camp for 4 to 6 year olds for years.  I used to use the Disney movie entitled ""I'm NoFool as a Pedestrian"" until I could no longer borrow it from a library.  This is the reason I purchased the Seemore's Playhouse movie listed.  I was disappointed that there was no mention of how to cross a street or parking lot safely where no crosswalk exists.  Also there is no mention mad about not chasing after a ball, not hiding behind a parked care etc.
  The other thing I disliked  were the interjected ""Harry the Hippo"" parts.  Even though the children seemed to like them they didn't teach much.
  Lastly,there was no explanation of the ""walk vs. don't walk"" symbols present at Stop Light intersections.  Sometimes even when the light is green it is NOT the time to cross.  I am picky because I do know the Disney movie covered these things.",1372377600,2,866,4.445859872611465
8301315,4,B001CY5N3M,"This movie does the job of teaching kids safety in a non-annoying-to-parents kind of way!  Keeps the attention of my 4 and 6 year olds.  They request it often and it is definitely helpful in reinforcing the things I've tried to teach them thousands of times!  My one complaint is that the menu screen is excessively loud compared to the volume of the episodes.  So much so that my kids complain and cover their ears.

There are two episodes on the disc; car safety and pedestrian safety.  This is a wonderful tool and I recommend it to any parent looking for a way to reinforce the rules to kids about keeping their seatbelts on in the car etc. and not running into traffic.  My kids are very visual learners (one's autistic) so they picked up the rules pretty quick.  I can remind them while we're out about what Seemore says about certain things.  It takes the pressure off of me as it's Seemore reminding them and not me.  :-)",1237593600,2,929,4.443786982248521
