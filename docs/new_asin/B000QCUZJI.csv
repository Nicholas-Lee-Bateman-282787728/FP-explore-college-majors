2836068,5,B000QCUZJI,"I am a big Terrence Hill fan. His movies are always good. I think he has a knack for picking parts that he is good at playing, if that makes any sense. My all time favorite is My Name is Nobody, with Henry Fonda.",1367280000,,212,3.840909090909091
2836069,5,B000QCUZJI,"I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she loves it.  She thought it was the best present ever, because she saw it once on VHS and then never found another copy of it;

She loves the Terence Hill/Robert Vaughn duo, especially the western/horse related ones.

It would go nicely with the boxset that is available, because this is one of the movies that isn't on it.

If you are into slapstick humour, you will like this movie.",1357171200,,429,4.325
2836070,5,B000QCUZJI,"It was a great move ....for the fact i was in it, and terence is a great actor to work with.
A lot of this move was made in Arizona and we played the part,along with others,of the bikers.
It was fun and its great to look back at the old times.

2836071,4,B000QCUZJI,"They advertise this film as part of the Lucky Luke series,but it isn't. But if you know that,you should like this film. Directed by the director of the famous Trinity series,this film has all the classic Trinity slapstick except that Terence Hill does not play Trinity in this one and Bud Spencer isn't in this one. For the most part this is a great classic Terence Hill modern day western. It is deffinitely one of his better films.",1336089600,2,433,4.564102564102564

2836073,2,B000QCUZJI,"Gift for my father so I haven't seen the movie.  Video quality is OK.  Realize that this is a DVD-R.  That is fine since it is disclosed.  However, the DVD Jacket has NO artwork.  It is a white colored jacket.  Title is the only thing on the front.  Back has a description.  DVD-R also has no artwork.  Cheap.",1260403200,,309,4.189655172413793
8195795,4,B000QCUZJI,"This is 1 of the best movies made in the 1980's.  It was good from beginning to the end.  I got mine in a 20 pack, but it has some problems.  It looks like someone recorded it from a VHS onto a DVD.  You sure don't see no automobile crashes any more, like you do on here.",1506988800,,271,3.7017543859649122

8195798,5,B000QCUZJI,"I don't know why the poster says that it's a western, it's not. This has nothing to do with the Trinity trilogy.
Anyway, with Terence HIll you cannot go wrong, another great movie, maybe the best he's ever done without Bud Spencer.

Ross Hill died after shooting this movie and it's such a shame because it was clear what a great actor he could have become.

The movie is funny, yet dramatic in some ways, with a final twist. I loved it",1474588800,,436,4.304878048780488

8195802,2,B000QCUZJI,"Since 'My Name is Nobody' trilogies Hill's performance as an actor has been on the decline.  Spoof westerns were liked because like slap stick comedies, viewer is entertained without out too much thinking.  Unfortunately 'Renegade'  is poor.",1402358400,,241,5.45945945945946
8195803,1,B000QCUZJI,"I did not like it, you may. This is not your John Wayne western, but the costumes, sets and directing is good. In reality, the theme is a slap at the classic western. You are better off to watch episodes of ""Hell on Wheels"" if you like classic westerns. Here the director decided that the popular westerns were not worthy of the film industry, so he made a movie so absurd to prove his point. He did that.",1381622400,,405,4.205128205128205
8195804,4,B000QCUZJI,"I enjoy Terrence Hill's light and spirited comedic work. Renegade (a.k.a. Renegade Luke?) is arguably better than My Name is Nobody and the Trinity films. It is fun and very well paced, with layers of humor including slapstick, exaggeration, and caricatures that don't quite fit the mold. Nothing is really overdone.

I deducted a star because of some weirdness with the film. It seems a little choppy for a commercial transfer. Besides the video and audio quality being somewhat poor, the closing credits end abruptly and the beginning titles are very rough. Terrence Hill's name is misspelled, for example. Then again, the Terrence Hill DVDs I own are even worse in some ways. The cover image for ""Renegade"" on Amazon is exactly like one of those DVD covers and is completely wrong in both cases. None of these problems really detract from the film - they're just a little jarring and take some getting used to.",1375833600,,913,4.852564102564102
