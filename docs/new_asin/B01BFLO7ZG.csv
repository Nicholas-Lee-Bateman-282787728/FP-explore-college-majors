Mostly everything in the movie seems well done: acting, lighting, editing, cinematography. Puppetry on a few characters looks wierd but it didn't take me out of the movie. Effects on the turtle, Pikadon or Love, all look very good. I'm not sure what my main complaint is: pacing, introducing character arcs over half the movie in, wondering what the overall goal of the movie was. While I was a bit unimpressed with the majority of the movie, it keeps coming up in my mind because it is unique.",1485820800,,608,4.587155963302752
