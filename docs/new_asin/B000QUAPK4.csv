8197363,5,B000QUAPK4,I remember growing up watching this show.  I still wish I had it and it was available in DVD.  It teaches children how to be kind and courteous to others.  Which in this day in age is lacking significantly.  I highly recommend this to every parent with little children.,1322006400,4,269,4.428571428571429

8197368,5,B000QUAPK4,My mother found a copy of this in a walmart sometime in the early 90s. I still remember all of the songs (they're catchy; put it on for the kids a few times and you'll be humming them forever) and we found a copy for my sister's baby shower last year. It's definitely held up with time. Good moral instruction without guilt trips or religious overtones. Highly recommended.,1248480000,,373,4.5
