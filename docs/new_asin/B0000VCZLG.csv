1948694,1,B0000VCZLG,"This newest version of the Spider Man animated series is terrible. The animation is poorly done, and obviously much cheaper to produce, than traditional cartooning. It would be half forgivable if the dialog wasn't so terrible. Marvel has to stop trying to cut corners with it's hot properties, this newest series will fade away, just like the last one, remember that future/off-world Spiderman cartoon? This ""hip"" new version won't snag a new audience, there's too much superior competition. The current X-men cartoon series sets the standard, followed closely by DC's Justice League. The new Spiderman cartoon is a lame attempt to cash in on the Tobey Maguire movie's success, well if owner Avi Arad (sounds like a third rate villian) wants to cash in yet again - he'll need to dig a little deeper into his fat pockets. When this series dies, perhaps Marvel will listen to the fans who kept the wall crawler alive and create a true cartoon instead of this animatronic drivel, here's hoping!",1069891200,7,991,4.940119760479042
1948695,5,B0000VCZLG,"First off let it be known that this is not an animated cartoon for children. Twelve and up sounds better to me. This show was on MTV, and was pretty well written but kind of hadan mtv style to it to attract mtv's viewers and thats wre it slumped a little bit. Other than that this show was very good and entertaining. The action was absolutely brilliant and if you like seeing spidey in action this is awesome. Fight scenes were great the voice tlent was pretty near perfect and the show was at many times funny. Watching spidey web swing was glorious , very well done. The show wasn't very well advertised bu that doenst mean it wasn't good, it was on , on friday nights at 10pm on mtv, and still was mtvs top rated show every friday it ran.the show will be continuing next year but not on MTV. It will be on a more child friendly network like cartoon network, and the thought of putting it on primetime on a channel like fox has even come to mind. This show will be back for a second season so keep an eye out sometime next year for it to hit airways again. If your a spiderman fan i'd recommend this to you, especially if your looking forsomething to hold you overuntil the second movie comes out in july of 2004",1069459200,,1215,4.218884120171674
1948696,5,B0000VCZLG,"This was the most perfect Spider-Man series of any yet made. Though it lacked the jazzy tunes of the original sixties series ;-), it far surpassed the convoluted mess that Marvel gave us in the early 90s.
With Brian Michael Bendis as an executive producer, how could this not be good? The visuals were excellent, lending a nifty neo-comic-book feel to the environments. The stories were inventive, coming up with some nifty new spins on classic pieces of the Spidey mythos. The best revision, of course, was that written by the not-infalliable-but-close BMB himself; taking the one-d villain Electro in a direction different from either the main or Ultimate comics stories but no less entertaining.
The Legion of Super Voice-Actors is in great form here: Neil Harris, Lisa Loeb, and Ian Ziering turn in performances that are almost always sonically superior to Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively. The guest stars shine, most notably Stan ""the Man"" Lee himself as Ezekiel (or whatever they called him, the guy who advised Peter to kill Kraven).
In short, if you're any sort of Spider-Man fan and you didn't catch it the first time around, I highly recommend purchasing the DVD of this series. It's something for everyone: a continuation of the movie in bite-size chunks, an animated adaptation of Ultimate Spider-Man, a way to get pumped for 2004's Spider-Man 2, and just a rollicking great cartoon all around. Five stars.
A single caveat: If you didn't know, this cartoon originally aired on MTV. With that sort of a target audience in mind, it should be no surprise that they made this series
UNSUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.
 If you're a parent who considered 2002's Spider-Man movie too intense for your child (as many, quite reasonably, did) this series is not a wise investment. Rather, find some of the other fine animated Spider-Man DVDs avaliable on Amazon.com- the ones you're looking for say (Animated), in parentheses, after the title, and are suitable for all ages.",1069200000,37,2000,5.006006006006006
1948697,3,B0000VCZLG,"First off, I'm a huge spider-man fan. I heard about this upcoming mtv series very early on and was in front of my tv for the premiere, and for the following few weeks. What I found when I tuned in was a beautifully animated show, with some nice ideas and characters, that ultimately fell short because of its scripts. The major problem with Spider-man the tv show was that it was a half hour in length. This gave the writers zero time to get you to the villian, have them fight spider-man, and then come to a resolution. Because of this alot of the episodes felt rushed, and alot of the endings were over the top. It's hard to end an episode in 5 min without making it seem like a really cheesy way to defeat a super villian. Maybe if it was an hour long like the much acclaimed smallville, it would have had a chance to flesh out its stories. But as it is the series fell short of expectations, and fell off of my tv radar.",1069113600,,924,4.167597765363128
1948698,4,B0000VCZLG,"Although I don't know the specific features of this disc set, I am familiar with the show and those responsible for it to offer some insight.  This show was in development just after the Spider-Man movie hit big in summer '02 and was developed under the supervision of Brian Michael Bendis, acclaimed and highly-popular writer of the comics series Powers, Daredevil, Ultimate Spider-Man and, most recently, Ultimate X-Men.  His influence on the show is notable in the snappy dialogue, solid plots and story arcs, and fresh continuity and character re-establishment.  The show loosely takes off from where the movie ends: Peter Parker, Harry Osborn, and Mary Jane Watson are students at Columbia University and Peter's identity is secret from everyone.  The animation style is reminiscent of the X-Box game ""Jet Set Radio Future;"" it has the line and flatter of cell animation, but with a noticeable CG look to it.  Unlike other shows that are actual digital-cell animation like Futurama, this show is a little more experimental.  The backgrounds are somewhat basic-looking, but the animation itself is pretty cool.  The recording and animation studio that put out this series is Canada's Mainframe, who gave us Reboot, the Beast Wars/Beast Machines Transformers series, and X-Men Evolution.  Among their core bank of voice talent, Neil Patrick Harris (of Doogie Howser and Starship Troopers fame) voices Peter Parker/Spider-Man; Ian Ziering (Beverly Hills 90210's ""Steve"") plays Harry Osborn; and songstress Lisa Loeb plays Mary Jane.  Guest stars (that I've noticed so far) have included Stan Lee, Michael Dorn (of Star Trek: The Next Generation) as Kraven, and couple MTV VJs/news people.  The series owes much to the movie and Bendis' Ultimate Spider-Man; the stories are all very contemporary and the villains (revamped or new) all make for a fun-to-watch animation experience.",1068681600,4,1881,5.303030303030303

1948722,1,B0000VCZLG,"This show was placed in a category as appropriate for kids.  However, I caution parents that this version of Spider-man is geared toward adults, possibly teens, due to the intensity and mature nature of some of the storylines and the language.  I am disappointed that Amazon listed this in the ""kids and family"" category.",1503187200,2,321,4.925925925925926
1948723,2,B0000VCZLG,"Well since it is NR(not rated) as far as age groups, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was a bit shocked when I put it on thinking ""How bad could a Spiderman show be"" and there were nonstop sexual innuendos.  I let my kids watch a lot of stuff other parents shy away from because I'm all about them first experiencing life in a controlled situation(with me supervising) rather than out in the real world where their questions go unanswered but this is just not appropriate for small children(3 & 6 years old).  Waaaay too many questions and confused looks just 5 minutes into this DVD.",1502928000,,584,4.4392523364485985
1948724,5,B0000VCZLG,"Gorgeous cell shaded look that aged so well. It really looks and feels like they're wondering around in a comic book. The plot lines are solid and entertaining.

This is NOT a show for young children. Sexual references and strong language are used. If those are things that bother you or bother you as a parent, don't watch this.

As for those adventurous enough to watch this: If you stream it the episodes are shown out of order. Look up an episode guide online to get that fixed.

I really wish they would make a movie using this universe, but Sony no longer has the rights.",1502582400,3,577,4.4245283018867925

1948726,2,B0000VCZLG,The show is just ok not good but not bad neither it's just not as good as the Spider-Man show in the 90s and I wish Amazon had a box set to purchase that works in the USA.,1498176000,,171,3.526315789473684

1948729,4,B0000VCZLG,"What drives me nuts about SpiderMan DVD releases is how I was ea$ily able to get The 67 Collection  yet cant get the 26 episodes produced in 1981. Or the three-years worth of stories generated by SpiderMan and His Amazing Friends around that same time. Or the five solid seasons that ran in the mid90s on FOX KIDS. Sure, some of these shows can be streamed, with quality issues. Or can be found on obscure DVD releases creating a disjointed narrative (See below). Its not like the repetitive repackaging of product isn't preposterously poor enough, but then the licensing legalities leave our loveable legends lingering in leisure limbo.

Okay, now that Ive got that out of my system. As to this series, which as other reviewers have pointed out, was also known as MTV SpiderMan. And thats because it ran on MTV for one season, back in 2003, on Friday nights. But I wouldnt really go by my opinion, as I started following the wall-crawler back in the late sixties, and enjoy even the most pitiful crumbs of related action. (Kind of like s#x with the brIde). What I can tell you is the show was an American/Canadian production, mixing something called cel shading with the CGI animation, and was intended to be a loose continuation of Sam Raimis first SpiderMan film (2002).

This Amazon listing is a bit misleading though, with the name of actor Edward Asner being listed at the very top. He voiced J. Jonah Jameson in the 1994 series, and had nothing to do with this one. The description in the Editorial Reviews does a better job, accurately mentioning the voice talents of actor Neil Patrick Harris (himself in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle) as Peter Parker, singer Lisa Loeb (Stay) as Mary Jane Watson, actor Ian Andrew Ziering (Testicles in The Legend of Awesome Maximus), and actor Keith Carradine (Jason B. in one episode of Mike Tyson Mysteries). There, that filled out that paragraph.

Enjoy!

NOTE: Below are some obscure Spidey DVD listings found here on Amazon. Trying to determine content & origination, a web search can get quite aggravating, so please forgive any inaccuracies. This information stems from the 2004 activities of a company called Musicland Group, who issued a few DVD collections until legal issues yanked the merchandise off the shelves. And also from a Canadian firm named Morningstar Entertainment, who in 2008 transferred some VHS tapes to DVD.

You'd think a spiderman cartoon could be enjoyed by all but the plot was definitely not kid appropriate. There was drinking, college parties, and bad language.  Not something I want my kids watching.  Also, the animation was terrible - I guess they were using some kind of CGI but it didn't seem right.

IMHO it is the worst animation of any of the Spiderman cartoons out there, yes including the ""original"". The 3D modeling is from a 90's video game engine, and is blocky, unnatural and plain unwatchable. Even my son commented, ""This is not good Daddy""...

1949594,5,B0000VCZLG,"TL;DR?? See Botom
I originally watched this series when it was first released. At that time I was a mere boy. A third grader who deeply connected with Peter Parker/Spider-man's character. I loved every bit of this show and I was so glad I was able to see it! I went to my local used media store and saw this tucked away next to all the other Spider-man movies. I watched the whole series for the first time in 11 years and wanted to write a review. I know, I know. I am far too late to the party, but might as well join it than to never go at all!

Now on to the Actual review.... Yes this series is nicknamed the MTV Spider-man, and yes it has language. The character's say Hell, Damn, Bitch, etc. So it might not have been appropriate for me to watch 11 years ago but I didn't turn out any different nor worse than someone who didn't. I'd recommend it to anyone age 12+. But that is a parent's choice, and I'm not one

The reason this got a 5 star rating is because I love it. Every bit of it. It has the cheesy electronic music from the early 2000s and the wardrobe is definitely something you would see from that time period. So I give it an A+ just from the nostalgia.

That isn't the only thing this series has going it self. It's got some great stars for voice acting, and Neil Patrick Harris does a great job as Peter Parker. The characters are fantastic and I love how they portrayed each individual. Not only that but they had a lot of input from MTV, and Stan Lee. Who by the way, makes a cameo later towards the end.

The story line is fantastic and filled with many ups and downs. The roller coaster ride of emotion was great but it ended on a cliff hanger. Sadly the never made another season, so it is a huge let down. And while I cannot tell you that this isn't as good without another season, it did leave people wondering what will happen next. There is no closure, and there will never be closure. But this is a series worth getting.

Sadly, this Peter Parker fan is disappointed that there is not another season. I'll get over it, but I would have loved to watch more of something that was created when I was so little. It made me feel like a little kid again.

SO TL;DR? Buy it if you like Spider-man! Just don't expect closure since there was never a follow up season.",1388448000,,2290,4.158013544018059

1949646,4,B0000VCZLG,"While I generally enjoyed this show, I did not like the herky-jerky movements of the characters as they walked or ran. Too, the wall crawling overly mimicked the quick crawling moves of a hobo spider. Spiderman looked like an arachnid when he moved and this went beyond what I'd been used to with hte character's movements.

I liked the presentations of ESU campus. Although if you look closely enough you will see the same stock characters as ""extras"" in multiple locations throughout the city! I mean the animators could at least have changed a hairstyle or skin color or jacket! The new foes and retconned enemies added to the show's complexity. I also liked seeing characters die and/or be seriously wounded. It added a realism seldom seen in even adult-oriented television cartoons.

This series showed how powerful Spiderman is. No one can stop him! The only baddies that have a chance are supervillains, and even they fall up short. If I were to encounter Spiderman I would beg him to let me go--beg him for another chance other than prison; for despite his extreme power, he does have a heart and might show mercy if a baddie could explain his situation and be contrite.

This show ranks at #3 all time behind the 1990s TV series and The Spectacular Spiderman of 2009. The ranking might change should Spiderman and His Amazing Friends ever be released onto DVD. As it stands, this DVD more than holds its own in the Spiderman pantheon.
Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed.

1949647,4,B0000VCZLG,"I'm one of the few people who DIDN'T like the 1990's Spider-Man series on FOX. Many people act like it was the greatest thing ever, but it was garbage. It was so heavily censored that Spider-Man was not allowed to throw punches. They also made Spidey a weakling. In one episode, Kingpin nearly crushed him to death (he only escaped after Green Goblin inadvertently saved him). In another episode, the Lizard attacked Spidey and he had to be rescued by Storm and Iron Man. The heroes who guest starred in that series regularly outshone Spidey.

This series was so much better. Spidey had his trademark sense of humor. Like many people said, it had a lot of sexual innuendo (I have a huge crush on Indy). There were also some adult themes (Spidey even had to deal with a stalker). No one under 14 should watch it. However, if you're a true Spider-Man fan you'll appreciate it. Many people have complained that Spider-Man does not fight his iconic villains like Venom and Doc Ock and while that is a legitimate complaint, I was happy to see new villains. He can only fight the same people so many times. I did not like the 3D graphics of the series, but that shouldn't deter people from buying this DVD. Each storyline was interesting and the fight scenes were well done. Since it was on at 10PM, they didn't have to worry about censors. I was so addicted to this series when I first watched it in 2003. I was VERY disappointed when it was cancelled. I won't give away the ending, but the finale ended in such a manner where there was no logical way for there to be a second season.",1354492800,2,1579,4.444827586206896

I wasn't hip to it when it premiered in 2003 on MTV, I'm just discovering this series. I really never cared too much about the cartoon adaptions since I had the comics, and in my opinion the comics were far better than the cartoons and the movies.

But I enjoyed this series. I did enjoy too seeing the content was more adult oriented and wasn't completely watered-down for kids. I wouldn't recommend this series for any kids though since it's clearly aimed at a more mature audience.",1333324800,,716,4.5859375

The computer animation is downright creepy, the character designs are unoriginal and repetitive, and the backgrounds are bland and boring.  But I could deal with all of that if there was good writing.  Instead, we get generally boring scripts fighting villains that mean nothing in the overall Spider-Man mythos.

1949684,2,B0000VCZLG,MTV tryed to be edgey. but most the time it doesn't work. For die hard spider-man fans only,1278460800,,91,4.111111111111111
1949685,4,B0000VCZLG,"Computer graphic (CG) animation gives The Amazing Spider-Man - The New Animated Series (2003), a unique look, particularly when applied to a character who can practically fly, and routinely makes radical moves in three dimensional space.  It may take a while to get used to the way Spider-Man and the other CG characters move and behave, but it is very easy to get caught up in the coolness of the visual presentation.  Spidey and his foes are capable of wild moves, allowing for some intense action, and high energy battles.

The cartoon seems to pick up where Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) left off.  Peter Parker, Harry Osborn, and Mary Jane Watson, are roommates attending college.  Parker concentrates on his studies, and works as a freelance photographer for The Dailey Bugle.  MJ is trying to further her acting career.  And Harry (who again looks nothing like the original comics), is trying to come to terms with the recent death of his father, Norman (Green Goblin) Osborn, former head of the Oscorp corporation.  Spider-Man is voiced by Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother), Mary Jane by singer Lisa Loeb, and Harry by Ian Ziering.

The kinds of adventures Spidey gets involved with vary widely.  The original  animated stories, draw only slightly from the character's classic comic past, with an emphasis on more modern themes and high tech aspects.  The quality of the writing runs the gamut, from excellent to poor, but the high quality of the animation helps to make each episode an interesting watch.

'Sword Of Shikata' features both an cool story, and some fantastic fighting scenes with a female assassin skilled in use of the sword.  'Law of the Jungle' pays a slight nod to an original villain, as Curt Connors experiments lead to him becoming the Lizard.  The CG version of the reptilian, moves like a Jurassic Park raptor.  'Spider-Man Dis-Sabled' has a shaky premise, but features Sable, another female assassin with a strong personality.  Returning to the well, the female villain thing is featured again in 'Keeping Secrets', where Harry's new girlfriend is also a high tech thief.  The best of the lot is probably the two parter 'Mind Games', where a pair of siblings with superior mental abilities, use their powers to convince Spidey to try and kill Kraven the hunter.  It is nice to see a genuine Spidey villain featured, as it at least provides some kind of frame of reference, however slight.  Something that is largely missing in the series.

The reworking of the origin of Electro in 'The Party', does not work well, and things get even worse, short circuiting in 'When Sparks Fly', when Electro returns with romance on his mind.  Another miss is 'Head Over Heels', a nutty tale, where Peter's lab partner Christina is a babbling whack job, who's mind is warped in an accident, to fixate on Spider-Man.

The collection truly shines in the extras department, as the bonus materials include several featurettes, onscreen tidbits, and a plethora of commentary tracks.  Headed by executive producer Morgan Gendel, and co-executive producer Audu Paden, the various tracks provide a wealth of background information about each episode, as well as general information about different aspects of production.  You will get some understanding of things like, why the characters' wardrobe does not change, how faces are animated, and how MJ's hair moves.  The decisions of the production team was subject to approval from Sony, MTV, and who knows who else, so getting things done was not always easy.  In his commentaries Neil Patrick Harris proves to be a fun guy, and a Spidey fan as well.  Marvel comics godfather, Stan Lee, lends his vocal talents to the project, and also appears in several commentaries.  Lee, who always seems to be very much a kid at heart, expresses great enthusiasm and appreciation for the project, which he co-executive produced.  Unfortunately the series was not renewed for a second season.",1264896000,,3950,4.977134146341464

Otherwise great spidey series. I loved how they added new villans and and still kept some of the old ones. I loved the animation and the moral dilemmas/struggles that peter parker had to go through as a college kid while balancing his dangerous alter ego life as spider man. Definitely worth buying.

The only unfortunate thing about this series is that it does not air on tv anymore. The series was cutshort before it could even began to bloom.

Unfortunately, with a few modest changes I could of recomended this for everyone. I think it kinda has a PG TO PG 13 rating due to some mild sexual content and a few curse words MTV deciding to throw in . If the relationships stayed allittle more modest and the eliminated the very few curs words that existed this would be great fun for everyone. As an adult its perfectly fine and a great series but I know how much i loved spiderman as a kid with the old cartoons which this is really more action packed. However, the minor flaws cant be ignored for younger kids. Its a solid 4 stars and thats simply because this should of been fun for the entire family and with a few minor changes it would of been .

There is cursing, sexual suggestions (mild but still there), and characters do die.  Fortunately he did not catch the swearing (we don't curse around him) and he's too young to understand anything sexual. But he is at an age when questions about death arise and this did not help.  If you do choose to let your younger viewer watch this then definitely use caution but I wouldn't recommend it.

From my adult eye, I also have to say I'm not a big fan of that style of animation.  It kind of feels like watching a video game.  And the voice of Spiderman just didn't fit somehow.",1222300800,3,682,4.28125

It's really as if we go back to the early days of Peter Parker (which would have been in the early '60's) and see what it would have been like if it took place in the early 21st century.

1949754,3,B0000VCZLG,"What this show does well, it does really well.  Sadly, when it drops the ball, the results are disastrous.

The show is entirely CG, but it doesn't look like anything else out there.  The world is rendered using relatively simple shading techniques, so that a freeze frame would look like it was in two dimensions instead of three.  When this works, the result looks so much like a comic book, you could drop a frame into an issue of Spiderman and never know the difference.  Unfortunately it doesn't always work: on occasion the backgrounds look as if they were copied from a video game.  A very old video game.

The real problem is that the similarities to comics stop with the animation.  The show is a new take on Spiderman.  And that take, well... it ain't so good.  The writing drags and just isn't enough fun.  There are also some huge missteps in the characters' personalities and motivations.  What makes it so hard to rate is that the writing isn't actually bad: it's professional, just misguided.  There was talent and effort here, but not enough inspiration.

If action alone is enough of a reward, pick this up.  There are fight scenes in here that raise the bar for this sort of a thing.  Just be aware that this show has some serious flaws.

Also, in case you miss it in every other review, this was made by MTV and isn't intended for young kids.",1179532800,4,1361,4.512295081967213
1949755,5,B0000VCZLG,"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003), which aired on MTV nearly four years ago, was a fun, witty, and well-written animated series. Visually, the show sets itself apart from not only all previous incarnations of Spider-Man's animated adventures, but also other animated series made for television as well. The computer animation on the show purposefully looks 2-D, a computer generated effect called cel-shading in computer generated imagery (CGI), created a moving comic book panel feel to the show. This really gives the show an interesting and unique look. Set non-canonically after the first Spider-Man movie, we see Peter, Mary-Jane Watson and Harry Osborn in college, attending Empire State University. Peter, of course works as a freelance photographer at The Daily Bugle. In addition to his obligations at the Bugle, he also shoot videos of city news events for Empire One, a spoof of the real world, New York One (NY1), a local New York cable news channel (to my knowledge, not being a native of the state of New York). Harry, not taking his father's death so well, yet not written as psychologically unstable as he is in the movies. As a self-professed ""trust fund baby,"" he is independently wealthy, inheriting his father's succesful and productive company, to which he owns a controlling interest in. A big flirt, hiding a bitter and angry young man inside who harbors an intense hatred for Spider-Man. Mary Jane, the strong willed and girly love of Peter's life. She is aggressive in her amorous intentions towards and for Peter, confiding in Harry about some of her love/lack of love issues with Peter.

The action in the series is nicely choreographed. Flexible and malleable, Spider-Man moves with a grace, swiftness and uncanny agility, much like what he exhibits in the comics. One of my favorite sequences in the episode titled ""Head Over Heels,"" shows Spider-Man routinely moving from one crime in progress to another, stoping each crime, saving people, then pausing to non-chalantely write his thoughts on a small note pad. Half the time he is barely looking at the people he is fighting or saving. A puzzled and perhaps curious man, after being saved, slowly tries to catch a glimpse at what Spider-Man is writing down on his note pad. Before the man gets close enough to read it, Spider-Man, seemingly without noticing the gentleman, quickly leaps up and away off camera. Dispite its light-hearted moments the series contains many more dark ones. Dealing with obesession, greed, honor, and lonliness, this series was no doubt in my mind, written for mid-teens and up.

Why is Spider-Man: The New Animated Series worth watching you ask?  Besides the aforementioned reasons, I'd like to add to the list of praise for this series - great voice acting.

The voice acting for one is superb. Neil Patrick Harris's voice fit the character of Peter Parker perfectly, nerdy and insecure.  While when Spider-Man, confident and witty.  The ability of the animators to express such a wide range of emotions utilizing a finite facial palette and body language via motion capture was masterful. What makes this series so good and makes it worth watching is the subtle nuances of the character's voice talent, facial expressions and body language. Some notable actors and music artists lent their voices to the animated project. Michael Dorn, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rob Zombie, Eve, Jeffrey Combs and Mr. Excelsior! himself, Stan ""The Man"" Lee.

Mainframe Entertainment, the company that brought us the first ever computer animated TV show, Reboot was responsible for the computer animation and effects series. Ironically, Spider-Man: The New Animated Series was already in early production before work on the 1st movie was realized, contrary to popular belief. The commentary on the DVD notes that much of reason and inspiration for the show's conception was due to the success of the Ultimate Spider-Man comic book written by Brian Michael Bendis and penciled by one of my favorite artists, Mark Bagley. Speaking of the commentaries section, they can be a bit dry at times, but are very educational as far as how truly in-depth and multi-layered the creation and production process was for an animated series of this caliber. Many behind-the-scenes elements mirror live action movie productions. Due to budget and time constraints, watching the series, you will notice many of the same characters walking around town doing different things and envolved with different events around the city. Not that that is completely unrealistic, especially when the story and events revolve primarily around the Empire State University campus. Another anomaly about the show is the fact that the order in which the episodes aired on MTV differs from the order in which they are presented on the DVDs. For example, the ""original"" and first episode that aired, ends up being episode 8 on the DVD.

Unfortunately, Spider-Man: The New Animated Series lasted for but 1 season of 13 episodes available in this complete two-disc set. For some reason, this DVD is not available through conventional retail channels.  Having tried several different brick and mortar retailers with no success, it appears this is only available online.  This show was definitely a sleeper, existing under the radar of many Spider-Man fans that I know. So wake up and buy it today if you are so inclined.",1178928000,11,5379,5.095346197502837

For a TV series, the CGI animation is awesome, allowing Spidey to summersault across the sky at breathtaking speeds and look incredible the whole way through. It's true, it does look like a video game sometimes, but  it works really well for this series, and the end result overall is very impressive - Spidey's never been able to move like this before in any other of his TV hits.  The stories tend to be good too, although some are certainly better than others. This series is made more for adults than for kids, sporting blood, death and violence where appropriate. Rob Zombie does the voice for the Lizard - one of the best stories here. The music for the show is done by John Digweed and Nick Muir, both legendary trance/techno DJ/producers, which means the show has rocking electronic trance music as its theme - a very nice touch which displays how seriously the quality of this series was taken. This special edition of the animated series contains all 13 episodes from the entire 1st season.

But if you haven't seen this shortlived hit, you need to experience it.  This version has more of a comicbook feel to it because it was geared toward an older audience.  Young adults, I believe.  But it felt more real than any other animated version I've been introduced to.  I grew up watching the animated series seen on Fox and that will always be my favorite, but until they release that on dvd, like they're ever going to, we have this to enjoy.  And in this version, Spidy gets to punch out the villains as much as his heart desires.  That's one thing the creaters of the 1994 animated series were forbidden to do...  To allow Spidy to throw a punch because those were the days when all that antiviolence stuff was going on.

  But anywho, this set features all 13 episodes from the series.  I only wish that more had been created.  That's the problem with American animated series today.  Too many people enjoy Anime and don't give stuff like this a chance anymore.

  We get to see such clasic villains as the Lizard, Kingpin, and Electro.  New but interesting villains include the Terradax organization, and a few more surprises as well.

Such a pretty girl chasing him, being turned down and continuing pursuit.  In the comics she gave him some of her time, but always had suitors.  They should realize that young people would like somewhat mature plot-lines just like in the comics.

The animation is great looking.  The series showcases some classic villains <Kraven, Lizard>, new twists on classic villains <Kingpin>, and new villains <Talon>.

I never watched this show when it was on MTV, so I took the chance on buying it. I heard mix reviews about the series.  I must say I wish other superhero animated series were done in the same fashion.  I would of rated it 5 stars, but I rated it 4 instead.  primarily for the reason that Peter, MJ, and Harry never change clothes.  This is a minor detail, but one I found a little annoying.

Another great feature is the fight scenes.  I wish the live action movies caprtured the spider like fighting abilities this series captures.

It's much better than the one made in the 90's (although that one was great, would love to see it on DVD sometime but it won't happen because Marvel is too greedy) and it has unique animation.  It's 3D but it still looks and feels like a cartoon.

Each episode is extremely well written and directed.  All the animated shots of Spiderman are superb.  He actually moves like a spider, much more so than other animated versions of this series.  All the action sequences were more exciting than any other Spiderman movie or series ever made.

I don't know why Marvel would only make ONE season of the best work they've ever done and leave us with such a cliffhanger season finale.  For diehard fans, that's a pretty nasty thing to do.  They probably won't make season 2.

It took just a little while to get used to the graphics, but then I found myself really getting into the stories. Sure, the stories and situations are different from the comics, but the characterization of Peter/Spider-man is spot on. I think this series captured his angst and personality as Peter and his wit and agility as Spider-man. His abilities have never been more accurately portrayed. Awesome to watch.

The only downer is that the cliffhanger at the end is never to be resolved as the series only went for one season. Very sad. I would have LOVED to have seen more of this!

1949781,3,B0000VCZLG,"In an attempt to revamp Spider-man yet again because the awsome movie directed by Sam Rami (Xena: Warrior Princess), Spider-man the new animated series: Season 1 was created. Its not bad I've watched it while it was one MTV. its supposedly takes place after the first movie; the characters seem to be the same (as much as the same a revamped character can remain) Peters still brooding over Mary Jane while getting every other girl in between, Harry's protrayed as a playboy (much to my dismay), and Mary Jane is still brooding over Peter's inablility to commit to her. The orignal comic book villians: The Kingpin, the Lizard (whom is only shown for a few minutes at best) and The Shocker manage to stay in almost-complete character surprisingly. But like in every other Superhero-revamp TV show there are stupid uncessary villains I've never even heard of in the comic book like the Japanese samurai woman, the Twins with physic powers, the nerd obsessed with Spiderman, and the white-haired assassin chick among others.

The plots for each episode aren't bad and run smoothly at times save for the first episode. However, it cannot be un-adressed that the animation in this show really needs working on: For example, when Peter runs off to save the day at times he looks as though he's about to ram you with his head. In other words he's sorta bent over. The facial animations are almost identical right down to the ""what gives?"" expression.

Lastly the motion animations are still as stiff and unrealistic as a video-game characters are. Plus I couldn't shake the feeling that MTV's putting Well-known celebrities voices (Eve, Rob Zombie, etc.) in the show was some kind of selling-point. Lastly the voice acting isn't bad however its not great either. The voice actors are lacking in some serious talent here (including Eve and Rob Zombie).

Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry all sound like and have dialouge that sounds like something out of ""Everwood"" or ""Gilmore girls"" or  better yet the late ""Buffy: the vampire slayer/Angel."" There is also implied sexual content, swearing and volince. All in all Spider-man: The new animated series isn't bad, just don't expect anything great here.

Just the fact that the animation is all in 3D (put with a 2D look), allows the camera to do some really interesting things, from pans, to spins, to rotations, and fly-thrus, and of course, the ultra-cool slo-mo effects.  This kind of camera control is something that just isn't possible in a traditionally hand-drawn cartoon.

2) The action sequences in general.  This isn't your grandfather's Spider-Man.  Much like Mainframe Entertainment's other CG shows, the action is much more mature than your ordinary animated show.  By that I mean the fight scenes and the ""chases"" are much more intense and, shall I say, violent than anything else I've seen in a cartoon such as this.  In fact, there's actually moments of blood from both Spidey and his enemies.  And as some of you may know, blood is almost always a ""no-no"" for childrens' animated shows.  So just with that, the viewer can easily tell that this show was made for a much more mature audience, which is always good in this circumstance, especially for comic book heroes.

3) The audio and video presentation.  The video is presented in 1.78 anamorphic widescreen and is extremely sharp.  Even looks good on a computer via DVD-ROM drive.  And the soundtrack is recorded in both DTS and DD 5.1 (always a plus for any show, eh?)  Also the widescreen presentation gives the show a bit of a epic cinematic feel to it.  How many cartoons do you know that were created in widescreen?

4) The villians.  The villians, some classic (with new looks), others new, were all great with maybe the exception of one, but that's to one's taste.  I thought the Terradax group were awesome.  Their suits and weapons were just too cool.  And again, the maturity of the dialogue for the villians and actions are just what makes these villians great.

So with all that said, let's all hope that this series gets picked up by some outlet for another season or more.  I'd love to see what the creators could do with the Venon and Carnage saga.  Hell, even Doc Oc, Green Goblin, and Hobgoblin would be great.  But can we get Parker out of college?  Being almost 10 years out myself, I despise the college atmosphere anymore.  Too many crazy activists and party animals.",1094342400,72,2548,4.690744920993228
1949786,5,B0000VCZLG,"As someone who doesn't have cable tv, the first time I saw this show was on a screen at a Sony store.  I bought the DVD based on the unusual look of the show and I was blown away.  Thank god someone is producing cartoons with gutsy writing, outstanding acting direction and a great stylized look.  I thought that great cartoons had died with Batman - The Animated Series.  Watching lame cartoons (like the mid 90's rehash of Spiderman that came along with the incredibly dull X-Men cartoon)makes you wonder why the creative 'geniuses' can't come up with something great.  I guess, having watched the informative featurettes included in this DVD set, the difference is money.  A lot of money has gone into this CGI SpiderMan and it's apparently all been well used.  I'm really hoping that I get to buy a second season DVD set next year.",1091577600,5,835,4.601351351351352

1949819,5,B0000VCZLG,"I've been wanting to see this for ages!!  And finally I rented it.  I really enjoyed it.  This show isn't excatly a link between the 1st movie and the sequel, but just a movie-tv-series sort of thing, although I was surprised how both this TV Series and Movie 2 had the same incident:  Mary Jane is acting on stage, Peter says he'll come, ""You're coming?"" Mary Jane says (in both!) and of course he doesn't make it in time.  All 13 episodes go for 20 -and-a-half mins.
The Enemies we see are Turbo Jet (either from the comic or not, I'm unsure - halfway through the episode I knew who he was), the Lizard (Connors is pretty tense and more annoying than he ever has been before - in this design the Lizard does not wear clothes, and is more wild), Kraven the Hunter, Electro (designed much better than ever before), Silver Sable, Kingpin (mix-up of original comic & Michael Clark Duncan version from DareDevil, same actor), and we even meet some new ones like the 'Psycho' Gain twins (I HATE THEM!!), 2 Big Motorcycle buys (forgot their names, sorry!), Shikata, Talon, Christina (crazy!!) and 'Pteradox' (evil group in uniform).  I suppose Venom would've taken up too much time in the show to be included, even if he would've looked good.  In this new take of 'spider-man' all these enemies are in some way personally related to Peter Parker, so it's not just another 'Good vs Bad' show where Peter's life is made complicated by Spider-Man.  One of the returning characters on this DVD are Flash Thompson the bully, as well as a look at Peter's parents and guardians, and some other voice actors from previous versions of 'Spider-man' appear in this version too, mostly from the mid-1990's version.  The violence however, is a little more extreme: apart from getting his suit torn, he does do a bit of bleeding, and sometimes a character loses part of their body, and other times there is a SLIGHT sexual reference.  But luckily there are a lot of funny scenes where Spider-man makes jokes or is in a bit of trouble.
The Special Features include 4 'Making of Features' including interviews with the cast/crew and Stan Lee, what-could-be Alternate TV Openings, Episode-Fact-Pop-Ups, (I think a look at the Game), Trailers of other Anime' and DVDs 'coming soon' and even Bloopers.  The animation is really good, although Spiderman looked muscular, he was also skinny, having slightly being modelled after ""Ultimate Spiderman"".  Just like in the earlier shows, his spider-lens-eyes open/move to match his emotions, and best of all Neil Patrick Harris does different voices for Peter Parker and Spider-Man: normal and slightly nervous for Peter but more grown-up and heroic/brave for Spider-man (but that's not the first time this happened.  It first happened in the 1960's animation).  A little mistake they make is incorrectly say when Rino Romano played Spiderman.  The Audio Commentaries talk about them discussing about making a Season 2.  I hope they do - ""maybe Season 2 will be better than Season 1"" - It certainly would help, after what happens . . . but you can just ignore the last two episodes!!  They change Mary-Jane's hair-length, but they explain why and I understand.  Stan Lee also appears as a character a few times.",1088640000,7,3230,4.810126582278481
1949820,5,B0000VCZLG,"I rented this DVD from my local rental shop thinking it to be the 90s cartoon series. I was plesently surprised to find it to be a brand new computer animated series, but with a differents. It looks and feels like a 3D comic book, at first it feels a little strange but once you get used to it you can really see that it was a great idea to use this cell-shsding techneque. The characters' expressions are wonderful, you can see real emotion on their faces but the new look still gives it that edgy comic book feel.
The story lines are also really good, they carry on from after the Spiderman movie left off.
I just can't wait for a second series to be made its fantastic!!!",1087948800,3,674,4.232558139534884

I hope someone picks up the show for next season seeing as how MTV has dropped the ball.  Great voice talents from Harris, Ziering, and Loeb to Michael Dorn (Worf on Star Trek), Griffin, and others.  Animation was good with a few quirks, but all animation features have a few of those.  I love the music during the intro.  If I didn't know better I would say that it is a modernized remaking of the music from the old cartoon.  Overall, this series is awesome and the DVD with all the extras and the first season is wonderful.  The kids and I watch it over and over.

1949823,2,B0000VCZLG,"Mainframe are known for creating gems such as ""Reboot"", ""Beast Wars"", ""Shadow Raiders"" and ""Barbie and the Nutcracker"", but apparently creating cartoons based on Marvel comic heroes doesn't exactly fall under thier jurisdiction
Whilst ""MTV'S Spider-Man Chroncicles"" boasts impressive animation and has the acclaimed writer Brian Michale Bendis serving with Stan Lee as executive producer, the series flals short of expectations.
Granted there are some people who find this series, filled with some dodgy character development, lame ""Mary sue"" villains, stupid origins for various classic villains, and really lousy performances from a few (Michael Clark Duncan phones it in as the Kingpin) appealing.
The DVD extras are the only reason to buy this, as the episodes only shine with good writing every two or three episodes after the last good one, with the extras, you can learn of the development of the series, a fascinating documentary, a hilarious blooper reel, and some stunning menus and Easter Eggs.
But if you want a good Spider-Man cartoon filled with excellent writing...buy the Beuna Vista Spider Man: The Animated Series DVDS",1085616000,2,1136,5.387640449438202

1949825,5,B0000VCZLG,"Truly the BEST ever incarnation of Spiderman and the best animated show EVER!!! Compared to previous animated Spidey's this was bold move, taking it in new, more mature and realistic directions. The 60's and 90's shows seem tame and childish in comparison.
Taking place after the Spider-Man movie this show revolves around the college adventures of Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry who have much better chemistry, character and dialogue than the movie ever offered. Each episode provides more drama and development and creativity. The stories are very imaginative and are obviously written by people who are passionate about Spiderman rather than a studio hashing a product together.
The computer animation is superb and resembles The Ultimate Spiderman comic book (my fave) more than anything. And I know Mary-Jane is only a CGI character but she is so beautiful, and she's voiced by the equally gorgeous Lisa Loeb. Neil Patrick Harris is the voice of Peter Parker and even in this performance he is a hundred times better than Tobey Maguire.
The show also offers some new, interesting characters like Indy, Cheyenne and Silver Sable and gives us alternate takes on Electro and Kraven. Though I was curious as to why Aunt May was not involved.
There is plenty of action and excitement to be had in every episode, all backed up to great music, MAN IS THAT THEME TUNE AWESOME! Where is the soundtrack CD?
The show could not have asked for a better DVD presentation. Not only do we get an absolutely stunning 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation but a thumpingly good, totally engaging DTS 5.1 soundtrack too. Each episode is a 22-minute movie that is far superior to anything the live-action effort was. There are also an abundance of extras on this 2-disc set, some interesting, some not. But a seriously good package for a great show. You must buy! Fan or no fan of Spidey this DVD is too good to be without.",1081555200,7,1908,4.8919753086419755

I read a lot of his stuff (Powers, Ultimate Spider-Man, Daredevil, etc.) and the man is a freakin' genius.  This show is NOT genius.  Some good action sequences, but that's about it.  The characters are SOOOOO flat.
This had so much potential, and it all deflated.  It just never gelled.  There was nothing cohesive about it.  How much money did they spend, and for what?  A few hours of a video game that I don't even get to control.
Really, that's it. Watching this show is like watching someone ELSE play a video game, itching for your chance to grab the controls . . . but you never get the controls.

1949848,5,B0000VCZLG,"I am perhaps the only ""fan"" of this series who hated the look of Peter and MJ and the baddies and yet I loved the animation and the series. The reason is the animation is brilliant, making it look like 3D continuously and very well-done shading and physics-based. But the look of Peter and MJ is bad and too many sharp edges on their faces and the bad guys (such as Electro... YECHHH!) simply didn't look like their namesakes in Marvel's universe. I got the feeling that Anime artists were hired to do this series and perhaps that is true I don't know or care. But I didn't think the inked lines were true to the Marvel universe and yet the stories were extremely compelling and the stories (and the artwork except as I note here) were very faithful (not exactly the same but faithful) to the original.

1949850,3,B0000VCZLG,"Just because Brian Michael Bendis serves as executive producer doesn't mean you can expect the same kind of brilliant writing you get in his various comics.  MTV's New Adventures of Spider-Man finds the wall crawler in yet another animated series (I've lost count how many times the Marvel hero has starred in his own animated show) this time created by Mainframe: the same folks who brought us the computer animated Reboot and Transformers: Beast Wars.  Using a computer generated cell-shaded design to present the show, Spidey looks great while he's webslinging, but everyday movements of normal people look jerky.  The story of this series picks up after the mega hit film with Spidey/Peter Parker (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris), his friend Harry Osborne (Ian Ziering), and his longtime crush Mary Jane Watson (Lisa Loeb) in college and features the webslinger taking on classic enemies like Kraven and The Lizard as well as new villians designed specifically for the show.  It's a notion that longtime fans of Spider-Man will either love or loathe as this collected first season offers a mixed bag of animation, voice acting, and storytelling.  Guest voices range from solid (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters) to lackluster (rapper Eve) and it will really depend on the fan whether or not they'll find the series enjoyable.  MTV has since dropped the series after airing it's first season, but my recommendation is that this new show is worth checking out, but many are better left sticking with the comics.",1077148800,15,1521,5.064

1949852,4,B0000VCZLG,"With the exception of Batman and Superman, Spider-Man is probably the most recognizable superhero in the world of comic books, as evidenced by a live action TV show, a movie (with impending sequel), and a whopping *six* animated series produced over the years. While the live action TV show was awful beyond belief and the movie a smashing success, the cartoons have been another matter. The '60s cartoon was a true product of its time, with limited animation (albeit a lot less limited than some of the cartoons for Spidey's Marvel contemporaries) and the now-infamous theme song. Marvel Productions' 1981 syndicated series was a boring affair with little of the famous Spider-Man personality, while the ""Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends"" series that began the same year (and teamed Spidey up with Iceman and the created-for-TV Firestar) was an astounding success (if somewhat dated by its attempts to fit NBC's often aggravating content requirements). The 1995 series was a jumbled attempt to retell many of the classic comic stories in an environment altered to fit modern perceptions of the character, and the follow-up series was doomed from the start due to heavy interference from the Fox Network.
All this brings us to this newest animated Spider-Man, which follows the movie and was produced for MTV with the hopes of ""modernizing"" the character. Using cel-shaded CGI animation, the series was a success for MTV, but like so many of their shows, has been cut loose almost before audiences had a chance to find it, and before the series was even close to reaching its potential. Despite MTV's bungling (which saw an emphasis on appearances by MTV-worthy artists like Eve and a de-emphasis on characters ranging from Aunt May to Flash Thompson to Doctor Octopus, as well as ""hip"" references to recent movies and shows), the show had potential. However, the animation is lacking (as the characters, like in just about every CGI series by Mainframe that I've seen, move robotically), and the DVD features even admit that the character and set designs were sorely limited by the CGI style used. Also, some of the new characters (Indy seems to be the whipping girl here) are ill developed, especially when there are better alternatives (i.e., Felicia Hardy) in the Spider-Man mythos. Also, the voice acting choices (beyond the rock stars involved) are often lacking compared to previous Spider-Man series, and skewed too much towards live action stars (Neil Patrick Harris, Ian Ziering, and James Marsters come to mind).
The DVD features are a nice mix, with factoids, commentaries, ""outtakes"", and developmental animation. However, this is not my new favorite Spider-Man series, nor will it likely be yours, but it *is* worth a look.",1076371200,6,2739,5.088888888888889

1949888,1,B0000VCZLG,"Being a fan of both animation and the Goddess that is Lisa Loeb I was very interested to see this series.  Unfortunately I missed every episode when it premiered on MTV.  When I heard it was being released on DVD I ran right out to buy it.  With a six pack in one hand and remote in the other I retired to the couch ready for the amazement of Spider-Man
  The first thing to ruffle my proverbial feathers was the animation.  Using a process of computer graphics to resemble traditional line art the animators were able to capture the worst of both worlds.  All the lack of depth of two-dimensional painting, with the stiffness of CGI.
  The actors, working with bad dialogue, just don't seem to capture the characters.  Neil Patrick Harris does fine as Peter Parker but as Spider-Man he toughens his voice, ala Kevin Conroy's Batman, and can't deliver the lines convincingly.  Lisa Loeb, seems the perfect choice to spout Mary Jane's ""Hi ya Tiger"".  Instead she loses all her cutsey sweetness and makes the character sound like a bitter scorned lover.  Ian Ziering's Harry Osborn is the most tolerable, but I must wonder if it's a result of his lack of screen time.
  The writing lacks the depth and character analysis of Batman: The Animated Series and the action of the previous Spider-Man animated series.  The villains are both updates on classic comic book characters and new ones created for the series.  Unfortunately none of them have any use except as a way for the animators to say ""Isn't this cool?""  ""No, as a matter of fact it isn't"".
  What a huge disappointment.  I just don't understand how this much talent could be assembled together to make this much mediocrity.  The best thing about this DVD is the fact that it is easily forgotten.",1074556800,11,1753,4.641693811074918

There are so much worse animated shows(all the other Spidey Shows are for an adult viewer horrible),that it is great to see what CGI can do on Dynamics. With Batman and Roughnecks this will stand on his own for decades.

1949891,4,B0000VCZLG,"Aside from the 5 star rating (I mean, come on. 5 stars implies  perfection, or close too it.), I totally agree with everything the previous reviewer said. If you want to see something that explores every corner of the Spider-man comic, then this isn't for you. Pick up one of the other, more for kids, DVDs of the 95 animated series that I consider a somewhat jumbled mess. If you however want to see something that is a little more adult and more related to the movie in terms of characters, then this is for you. But fear not old schoolers. There are some familiar Spidey villians here such as Kraven the Hunter, Silver Sable, Kingpin, the Lizard, and a Electro who only resembles the comic version in name. (The Lizard episode is my favorite) Most of the episodes involve villians that were developed exclusively for the show. But what's wrong with that? I do enjoy the way Peter is portrayed in this series. He is a smart and very responsible kid here. The emphasis on these qualities make him even more heroic. Many times it is his brain that allows him to triumph over the villian rather than just his Spider-abilities. If it wasn't for the more adult action and relationship themes, I would recommend this for kids as Peter is someone to emulate here. And of course, he still has his witty Spidey one liners.

The extras, listed on this page are somewhat dry. It would have been nice to see something about Spidey's origins or about the translation from comic, but it is mostly stuff concerning production of this series. There are plenty of cool trailers on disk one though as well as a commentary track and pop-up Spidey fact for every episode.
If you are a fan of the movie and need something to hold you till Spider-man 2, or even just a comic fan, you may like this. Marvel's writer of ""Ultimate Spider-man"", Brian Micheal Bendis co-produced this series and it shows. It very much has the feel of that great comic. This set contains all 13 episodes of the first season of the show. That's over 5 hours of fun, and interesting Spidey-adventure.",1074297600,,2055,4.56639566395664

There's quite a few special features, and they're the usual sort you can find on a DVD, such as commentary, trailers, behind-the-scenes stuff, and the rest, but the episodes themselves are quite interesting.  Best of all, the episodes are placed IN ORDER, something MTV failed to do, which is why the problems with the Electro episodes caused some confusion.  There's quite a bit of talent, starring Neil Patrick Harris and Lisa Loeb, as well as guests like Rob Zombie(as the Lizard!  PS, Lizard fans may lose it when they see his episode), Micheal Clark Duncan(reprising his role of the Kingpin from the Daredevil movie), Edward Asner, Jennifer Hale, Rino Romano(all three having done voices in previous Spidey cartoons), Tara Strong(stalking Spidey!), Micheal Dorn(as Kraven), and of course, Stan Lee himself.

1949893,5,B0000VCZLG,"First of all, lemme begin by saying that I'm only a marginal Spidey-fan.  With that outta the way, lemme say that I'm a HUGE fan of this animated series, and especially the DVD!  The animation is vividly and fluidly stunning, the cinematic touches given to the cinematography and direction are entrancing, and the audience is treated like they actually have a mind (and are not 7 year-olds in front of the tube on Saturday morning).  I'm also incredibly impressed that much of the DVD content enjoyed the benefit of anamorphic enhancement.
I don't, however, know what MTV was smoking when the coin landed and they decided on Spidey's time slot . . . but MTV has issues anyway.  To be honest, watching Spidey on MTV was the first time I'd watched MTV in years.  Alas, I remember when they used to be a music TV channel.  Oh well . . .
Anyway, I LOVE THIS DVD/SERIES . . . AND I WANT MORE!  Excellent job to all who had a hand in putting this amazingly well-done show together!  My only request, however, is that you make all of the content anamorphic.  In a very short time, all of the viewers of your content will have widescreen, progressive-capable hardware on which to view your stuff.
Thanks for reading!

1949894,5,B0000VCZLG,"I've long been a fan of the spider-man comics, being the only comics I ever collected and still collect.  Sometimes I didn't get them because of the bad art, once in a while I bought the bad art for the storyline in the books.  I only like a few scenes in the movie of how Spiderman fought and moved.  All the cartoons done in the past, I've been disappointed by the humor and moves.  Often by the graphics as well.  With this new cartoon tho, I showed at 2am at Walmart and made the cashier get it from the back of new arrivals, and put a price on it right then and there so I could walk out owning it, which I did.  PERFECT.  I'm no fan of organic webbing, yet still I say PERFECT graphics, PERFECT acting, PERFECT characters, PERFECT moves and choreography.  This is how I've always imagined Spidey moving.  This is the hero I'm a fan of.  Excellent job to the makers of, outtake bloopers on the DVD are hilarious and impressively creative as well.  I'm waiting rather impatiently for Season 2 DVD.",1074211200,3,1001,4.327956989247312
1949905,5,B0000VCZLG,"I just recently purchased the DVD set and am anxiously awaiting the fate of this television series.  I didn't get into it when it was first coming out on television because I am not the hugest fan of the MTV programming of recent years and feared what might happen because of the way most of its programming has been like.  I caught only a few episodes when it was on just out of curiousity and discovered it was really good, the stories, the voice work, the new characters, and even the animation.  The only problem with the DVD is that you NEED to know what happens next and I truly hope that someone will pick up this television and give Bendis more opportunities to see what he can really do.",1074124800,2,696,4.338461538461538
1949906,5,B0000VCZLG,"I liked this version of Spider-man, maybe even better than the movie, much better than the Fox series in the nineties.  The animation is far better than most of what marvel has been putting out lately.  I expected to hate it because I don't generally like computer animation but I thought they did Spidey justice.  The stories were good at integrating old spidey enemies and new characters.  The one weak link was the MJ - Peter relationship.  Since the story is set in the movie universe, they could not move their relationship forward at all.  This led to some frustrating and unbelievable interactions between them.  Also, I'd like to see the characters wear some different clothes from time to time.  I do like the actors they got for the parts.  Many would call me a fanboy, and I was pleased with this series overall.  I expect I will buy it when it hits the shelves.",1073952000,4,873,4.574193548387097
1949907,5,B0000VCZLG,"I am not the world's biggest Spider-Man fan, but I like a good superhero show when I can find one. This series was the best thing to come around since The Batman Animated Series originally aired on FOX. Other than the fact that the series was based on the movie-version of Spider-Man (which was not an entirely bad thing), this was the best-animated series EVER produced for TV. The animation was lightning-fast & really looked comic-bookish, and the writing was pretty good too. Unfortunately, MTV did not know what to do with it. MTV stuck it in a terrible time slot, and re-ran the first few episodes to death. Subsequent new episodes were hard to track down. I personally missed several of the episodes when they originally aired, so I was looking forward to the release of a collected set.",1073952000,3,794,4.678571428571429
1949908,5,B0000VCZLG,"I for one liked this Spider-Man series. While I can see it might not be everyone's taste, I found it to be fun and action oriented and hope it gets a chance at a second season to develop further.
I love how the animation looks like a 3-dimensional comic book. Other's may complain that CGI should look like the Final Fantasy movie. Sure it may look real standing still but I found the performances almost creepy in how zombie-like the movement is. CGI just doesn't look real to me.
MTV's Spider-Man still has the look of a cartoon so movement issues can be forgiven. Unlike traditional cell animation, this series was able to render action scences from all angles allowing the ""camera"" to move through out the scene to great effect.
The voice cast is all perfect for their roles. Neil and Lisa work really well together.
And as always, don't judge a show based on internet rumors. More often than not they turn out to be completly false, just smear tactics used by angry ""fanboys"".",1073952000,,981,4.579545454545454

1949910,5,B0000VCZLG,"One Word...AWESOME!!! I was a bit skeptical at first, it being on MTV and all, but I was impressed. I've been a big fan of spider-man since I was like 4 or 5, and I got to see all the reruns of Spider-man and His amazing Friends(ok, it was just ok...), and the original 1968 series.
When they came out with the SPIDER-MAN THE ANIMATED SERIES show, I was excited with the premiere episode in December with the Lizard. Then Feb 4th of 1994 I was pumped. The show ended on a clif hanger. The that horrible show, SPIDER-MAN UNLIMITED came on...Oh, the animation was ok, but the plots, the characters, Venom and Carnage in general, were HORRIBLE!!!, thank goodness it only lasted like 41-43 episodes. I watched it, but I was kinda freaked out by all that went on in it, being like Marvel didn't even have a hand in the series...
It's been a few years since it ended, and after the Spidey movie came out, I couldn't wait for something else to come out...then, this past Summer, SPIDER-MAN came out on MTV(the horror something like that on MTV, but I dealt with it...)...MAN THIS SERIES ROCKED!!!, I mean it was GREAT!!!...by the time the series ended, at the end of September, early October, I was like, WHAT, THAT'S IT?!...I was bummed out, and then like a week or so later, I looked up what would become of it, and lo, and behold, IT'S COMING OUT ON DVD!!!! I can't wait to get it on DVD!!!.
This series is gonna be great when they get the second season rolling. I thoroughly enjoyed the first season, and the animation was a bit wierd at first, but I got used to it in like 3-5 minutes, the cell shading is great, I like that it's like watching video game-type graphics, and the stories are great...I MEAN, WITH THE GREAT BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS WRITING THIS, HOW CAN IT BE BAD!!!?!?!? He is a great writer, being his older series and his newer work in the new ULTIMATE UNIVERSE...I think this series is really gonna stick this time, with an actual Spider-man Comic book writer writing it, instead of someone just pulling stuff from the comics, or just out of thin air. That's why I think Spider-man 2 the movie is gonna be better than the first(well, how much better do you want it other than organic web fluid, but hey, beggars can't be choosers...)...J. Michael Straczynski lending a hand with the movie, I think it'll be so much closer to the comics than ever before, which for some people, might be bad, but for me, I'll be a happy person...lol
So, Kudos to this DVD, I'll be waiting for with baited breath for it's arrival...and until Batman runs off with Wonder Woman, Make Mine Marvel!!!",1072483200,15,2589,4.4641350210970465
1949911,5,B0000VCZLG,"This show isn't about the animation.  Personally, I LOVE the animation.  There's nothing wrong with it.  People hear that it's CG and expect it to look lifelike.  That's not what the producers were aiming for.  There is a cartoony look because it is a show about a COMIC BOOK character.  It has a comic book feel.  The movements, however, are very lifelike.  I don't see how anyone could hate this animation more than the Spidey series from the 90s.  The 90s one had much worse animation (though I didn't mind that either).
But this show isn't about the animation.  The plots are good, the scripts are good, in general, the writing is good.  There's is absolutely nothing wrong with the dialogue.  In fact, I've found it to be very similar to the way high school friends talk to eacher.  Now, the characters are supposed to be in college, and the things Peter's science teacher talks about are clearly high school information, but the audience is primarily high school students.
Plus, this show takes off from the movie.  If you liked the movie you should love this!  People complaining about this show should have hated the movie.  And if they hated the movie they should never have watched the show.  I love Spider-Man and I love all the current interpretations of him.  I think this show was better than the movie.  Peter's character was more what it should have been as was Spider-Man's.  The movie completely missed Spidey's wit.  This show pulls off his quick one-liners perfectly.  It's very much the way Spider-Man is in the comics.
I've seen complaints on here talking about differnt things in different episodes, including the final episode!  If people hated it that much, they wouldn't have stuck around for the final episode.  This is a good series that appeals to not only comic fans, but fans of the movie and people who just might have found this show through channel surffing.  With all the special features, this DVD is mostly likely going to be worth the price.  I suggest you check it out.  And, hey, if you're still not sure, you can always download a sample episode.  ;-)",1072224000,5,2092,4.688705234159779
