7423787,5,B014THIIIK,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: This star-studded Italian film asks just how far family loyalties, and protection of those you love, can go. And, The Dinner has been beautifully created for film from a best selling novel by Herman Koch by director Ivano de Matteo.

Real family dynamics are on full display here; no Norman Rockwell-esque illusions of a table filled with adoration and respect. Um, no. One boisterous brother defends seemingly horrid clients in court, while the other saves childrens lives in hospital; high power attorney vs. pediatrician. The two, along with wives-in-tow, meet for a tense play on dinner each month at a swanky restaurant. With each evening they do the family tolerance dance like a competitive competition. They chat and chew friendly enough but the undercurrents are deep, dark, and you know just bellow the surface are sea-monster big issues waiting to battle ala Ghidoraha meets Carcinus.

Then theres the offspring we meet at home; each brother has a child, about the same age, that hang out together socially. These two, a girl and a boy, enjoy watching violent videos and generally being kinda generic self-centered teens with obligatory roles-assigned  the popular perfect faaded gal and the quiet angst-ridden boy...

After an alcohol riddled party the two do something really cruel and life-changing to someone theyve dismissed as useless. As security footage, and knowledge of the horrific deed, bathes over the parents like a hailstorm of volcanic spew, their reactions immediately take the already polarized and fracture the core. The weighing of options begins.

The Dinner builds upon morality and family a subject that translates into any language. And, here, makes one helluva film.",1448668800,9,1750,5.235714285714286
7423788,4,B014THIIIK,"I know that the title of my review is a bit ambiguous but it really summarizes this 92-minute Italian film  based on a novel by Herman Koch (which I have not read) without giving away too much. If youve read my other Amazon reviews, you know I hate spoilers and  honestly  I urge you to not read long reviews before you see this film.  Though its not a mystery, its best enjoyed letting the facts reveal themselves.

I did like this film. The subtitles were in white and outlined in black making them easy to read. But, you will probably want to keep your finger on the pause button on your remote because often the dialogue goes by fast and you won't be able to read important lines at the same speed at which they are spoken on the screen.

The one thing that bothered me in this film is a scene of graphic full-frontal female nudity. Im not against nudity but this scene added nothing to the story  and actually distracted me from the real plot. I felt it was gratuitous,

There are two Bonus features. (The package lists just one  the behind the scenes one). This runs about 15 minutes and is in Italian with English subtitles. The director narrates it and talks REALLY fast. I personally didn't think it added anything. The other Bonus is a 5 minute montage of scenes to music  with no dialogue. I thought this was useless. Then there is the trailer.

After watching it with someone Im sure it will lead to a discussion of ethical choices. But thats all Im revealing here.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8731806,4,B014THIIIK,"First, I have not yet read Herman Koch's novel -- though I plan to soon.  Second,  I watched this film after having just watched the DISASTROUS American film starring Richard Gere, Steve Coogan, Laura Linney and Rebecca Hall.  I almost immediately gave this film, the Italian film, 5 stars just because it is so so so so much better than the American film . . . but in reading other reviews I suspect that it does not live up to the novel, so I compromised at 4 stars.

The moral issues are important and timely ones:  I hope Koch's novel goes in to them further than either of the films.  I look forward to reading it.",1510876800,,619,4.293103448275862

8731808,5,B014THIIIK,"This was a great adaptation of the book. It carried through many of the same themes & same basic plot -- what is the moral responsibility of a parent? Are we justified to get rid of the losers, the annoying ones, the disgusting? What is the line between a sociopathic mindset and the daily moral justifications that we make for ourselves in the grand scheme of things? Do we excuse teenagers because they do not have fully developed moral criteria? It added many nuances not felt in the book. I think they gave the book a particularly Italian feel -- the book certain feels very Dutch in the interactions and scenery... Lovely acting by all and marvelous photography. I could quibble about a lot of things. (For one: an underlying theme of racism, arguably critical to the book, is  missing in the movie...) But it's an imaginative and lovely interpretation of the book. SPOILERS I would say this book distills but varies a basic theme: the narration of Hamlet-ish indecision (and guilt) by the ""violent"" brother as to whether he should do anything about his violent son. In the book, the narrator is that sociopathic dad, but I think that is less clear in the movie. So there is a twist: in the book, the dad refuses to take any action to ""take out his bother"" - his wife does it by smashing a wine glass into her brother-in-law's face - but in the movie, the violent brother takes out his brother directly - hitting him with a car (to prevent him from confessing his daughter's guilt). Some themes in the book are not found here- the unsuccessful teacher whose life was undone by his violent tendencies- which his son has inherited; the musings on genetics and the fact that that the mother not the father decided not to abort the fetus; the comparisons of the son's relationship with father and mother... and so on. So the book and movie are different but I would say it is a faithful adaptation of the color and tone of the book. They both puzzle over many questions and do not give a very satisfactory answer.",1495324800,2,2014,4.548209366391185
8731809,5,B014THIIIK,Wonderful acting. Pace is deliberate and this gives the viewer time to notice the many emotions flickering across the faces of the characters.,1489881600,2,142,5.217391304347826
8731810,1,B014THIIIK,"I saw this a few days after I read the novel, and while not surprised the film makers made some changes, it was
very different from the book, and not in a good way.  It was too short to really explain the nuance and
motivation of each character.  One moment the female cousin is a sweet and helpful girl, the next
she is laughing while brutally assaulting an innocent woman.  The ending is ridiculous, like out of a cheap
made-for-tv grade c thriller.  The actors were all good for the most part.  And the use of multiple interior
scenes was done as well as Woody Allen.  Yet the story is poor - it almost seemed like portions
were cut.  Sorry - I will be interested in the 2017 release with Richard Gere & Laura Linney.",1481932800,3,720,4.288888888888889
8731811,3,B014THIIIK,"This version is ok. Its nothing like the book or even remotely close to it. I would suggest watching Het Dinner instead if you really enjoyed he book. The American version is supposed to be out soon but I'm not sure how well that will be. I had to read this for class, I really thought the book was boring, but this movie isn't like it at all. Just watch Het Dinner weather or not you liked the book, there's so much more emotion in it and it plays ou well. It's not exactly the book, but its way better than this one on so many levels.",1478736000,3,536,4.018691588785047
8731812,2,B014THIIIK,Expected more. Storyline disconnected. Just all over the map with little storyline continuity.,1457222400,,94,6.3076923076923075
8731813,2,B014THIIIK,"And beyond the subtitle issue is the movie itself.  It is VERY loosely based on the excellent Herman Koch novel.  It really feels like the writers went through the novel piecemeal and removed the entire body of the book and left the teeny portion size of the book about a boy who beats someone to death.  Everything else interesting was removed.  I will admit that it's kind of hard for me to separate my disappointment in how very different the book v movie was from the actual quality of the movie.  That said, even if the film was great, the subtitle issue (which isn't too bad initially but becomes more and more staggered throughout the movie) knocks 2 stars off.  It's that bad.",1452988800,7,684,4.520325203252033

8731815,5,B014THIIIK,"Ivano De Matteo wrote (with Valentina Ferlan) and directed this tough little film that takes a bit out of contemporary mores and serves is up as dinner. It is classy in every aspect, the only exception being the crime that turns out to be the denouement of the story.  It is a story about two brothers and their wives, and the interactions between them and their two high school age children. And the consequences that occur when the kids get into serious trouble together e manner in which the parents relationships change with and among each other.

The well scripted synopsis states, THE DINNER turns an ordinary meal among family into a taut morality play as the limits of polite society are tested and two brothers discover just how little they know about each other. To Massimo (Alessandro Gassman), a gutsy defense attorney, the monthly dinners with his pediatrician brother Paolo (Luigi Lo Cascio) and their wives at a posh local restaurant are a status symbol, even if the time is spent in forced familiarity and inconsequential conversation about the latest films, the day's news or their children's schoolwork. When Paolo's wife Clara (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) sees disturbing security camera footage of a homeless woman being mercilessly beaten, she worries it may be her teenage son Michele (Jacopo Olmo Antipori) and his cousin, Massimo's daughter Benni (Rosabell Laurenti Sellers), who are responsible for the gruesome attack. Their fragile balancing act of respectability and class now shattered, the two families navigate the repercussions of this senseless assault, revealing in the process the skewed priorities and moral shortcomings of their privileged, insulated perspectives.

This is a film that is beautifully scripted and acted and offers a fine reminder of how fine Italian films can be. Grady Harp, December 15",1449014400,,1835,5.1925675675675675
