6398981,5,B00K1NNK26,Great look at a medium that doesn't get a lot of documentary love.,1433635200,,66,4.153846153846154
6398982,4,B00K1NNK26,I really enjoyed hearing from all of the talented cartoonists who talked about every aspect of the business.,1432252800,,108,5.055555555555555
6398983,5,B00K1NNK26,"If for no other reason, watch this because Bill Watterson is interviewed. Just his voice was recorded, but that's still something. He's written the odd article, and has been interviewed here and there, but mostly, he's hidden wherever Calvin is playing with Hobbes, checking out some great adventure. Or not. No one knows. Which is my point. Bill Watterson is in this one.

Beyond the great Bill Watterson, there's tons more here. Interviews of cartoonists talking about their craft, the creative process, their competition, and the changing world of cartooning. Newspapers are evolving so what's next? They wrestle with that, as well as talk about how they got to where they are. Each is remarkably humble -- the interviews feel as intimate as a conversation over dinner.

This movie is for creatives all over, not just comic strip artists and writers. All of us. It helps to know and love the strips -- and if you do, you no doubt will wish there was another five hours of this, with more interviews. A few are missing, like Charles Schulz (though his wife is significantly), Garry Trudeau, and Chester Gould. But there's enough of Mort Walker, Cathy Guisewite, Jim Davis, Bill Amend and others to make this worth watching. A few are interviewed who are too new, or not significant enough to consider themselves even vaguely close to the greats, but I'll let you sort that out.

I fully recommend, ""Stripped: A Revealing Look At the World's Greatest Comic Strips.""

6398984,5,B00K1NNK26,This film is very insightful view to someone ho wants to know more about the subject of strip comic writing. or just a look at the interviews with the heavy-hitters interviewed in this compilation.

6398987,5,B00K1NNK26,"I found this on iTunes after watching Dear Mr. Watterson a million times. I love it, I like watching the drawing/inking/art, and they cover a lot of different perspectives on comic strips and where it might be headed next.
My only wish is that there was a way to turn off the closed captioning, but it's not a deal breaker, and the ""closed captioned"" was marked on the item description, so can't really complain. (And I can watch the iTunes version if they bother me)

OPERATOR ERROR: I found a button on my remote I'd never used labeled subtitle, pressed it, and the closed captions are gone. Unequivocal 5 star rating is achieved!

6398990,5,B00K1NNK26,"Required viewing for anyone interested in comic strips and/or webcomics, since the makers (Dave Kellett, author of the webcomic Sheldon, and Fred Schroeder) managed to get interviews with many big names. On the traditional newspaper comic side, they talk to Mort Walker (Beetle Bailey), Cathy Guisewite (Cathy), Lynn Johnston (For Better or For Worse), Jim Davis (Garfield), Stephan Pastis (Pearls Before Swine), Jeff Keane (The Family Circus), Bill Amend (Foxtrot), and even Bill Watterson (Calvin & Hobbes)! (Hes audio only, although he also contributed the poster art.)

From webcomics, contributors include Mike & Jerry (Penny Arcade), Matt Inman (The Oatmeal), Kate Beaton (Hark! A Vagrant), Danielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots), Scott Kurtz (PvP), Dylan Meconis (Family Man), and more. There are even a few people, such as Keith Knight, whove done both, navigating the transition from print syndication to handling his own business digitally. And thats the meat of this movie: exploring, as the ad copy has it, how [cartooning] survives the shift from print to pixels. I don't know that you're going to come away with any definitive answer, but clearly, most of these people are thinking about the change, with a whole section of the movie about the demise of newspapers. Youll likely also come away with a distinct perception of different generations of creators, from those whove always had a syndicate handling business for them, to those who took advance of the early days of the web to establish themselves when there wasn't much out there. Ones even a bit bitter about the changes hes had to face, but many are reacting to the world the way it is now.

Stripped is a very watchable overview of the field, with some comic strip history, neat glimpses into working habits, and much discussion of how great comics are and fond memories people have of reading them. My favorite part was when the problem of making money as a webcartoonist is illustrated as though it was an 8-bit video game.

I never thought someone could do a good job of explaining the syndicate model of comic distribution that wasn't a snoozefest. They do a great job of paying tribute to comics of old, celebrating the comics still happening, and showing where the future of comics is heading.

Where this film shines is with all the people they talk to. Just hearing from all these artists is incredible! What I enjoy most is how candid this is. They just have a great conversation with every single person. Buy this film and you will not regret it!!",1405728000,,685,4.846153846153846

6399023,5,B00K1NNK26,"The moment I heard about this project, I knew I was going to love it.  When my copy arrived in the mail, it was everything I had hoped for and more!  Collecting an incredible range of creators from all realms of the industry, it explores the history of comics, the creative process, and ponders what will come next for the strips we love in our increasingly digital world.

The inspiration and insight I've received from this documentary are boundless.  On my first viewing (okay, if I'm 100% honest it's been EVERY viewing), the moment I heard Bill Watterson's voice I immediately teared up.  To hear the thoughts of the man that created Calvin and Hobbes, whose work so completely captivated me ever since I was a child, was nothing short of magical.  And that's only the tip of the iceberg!  There are so many great perspectives shared by the 50+ creators featured.  Whether it's finding new ways to access the creative spark and ""shoot down"" the muse, or finally having the necessary context to ""get"" Cathy, this film is packed with untold gems.

As a comic creator myself, I've also found it's a great motivator.  Every time I watch Stripped, afterwards I'm rushing to the drawing board, revitalized and ready to tackle the next page!  Hey, some people burn incense (as you'll discover!) and others...they watch Stripped!

I definitely recommend this film if you're a comic enthusiast, creator, or simply someone that wonders about what's going to happen to those good ol' funny papers.",1405555200,4,1491,4.826771653543307

And, of course, with the first recorded interview with ""Calvin & Hobbes"" creator Bill Watterson, this is a movie that the true fan of comics and cartooning MUST watch.

8655219,2,B00K1NNK26,"Think about this for just a moment- you love to draw and write comics. Youve read newspaper strips your whole life, and have been inspired by countless legends in the business. You send out ideas, and finally, you get your dream job. Youll be working every single day without a day off, until your contract expires or until you quit. New material is always needed. A new strip is required every day, and you're going to need to have ideas all the time because of this. As much as you love to draw and write, can you really come up with something every single day for a newspaper? Especially for a dying format?

Ok, got that?

Thats what 90% of this documentary covers. And not very well.

The main reason I watched Stripped was, as Im sure everyone else did, because Bill Watterson was interviewed for it. The legendary artist who gave us Calvin and Hobbes, a strip thats just as important today as it was when it was in newspapers. The legendary artist who literally has TWO photos of himself online. There are more pictures of Bigfoot than there are of Bill Watterson. I could go on about him, but in the off-chance that you don't know just how mythical he is, the guy basically created an amazing comic strip, and was never seen or heard from again until a few years ago when he did a guest spot on Pearls Before Swine, drawing a few panels. Watterson never even officially gave out his characters to be used for merchandise, and yet you constantly see those dumb Calvin window decals everywhere. So obviously, for him to be featured in any kind of documentary or anything, it has to be a big deal, right?

Unfortunately, Bill Watterson is only here for a couple of sentences, and its just his voice over other footage. His segment comes, and he says some cool things, but its pretty standard with the flow of the documentary. Then hes gone, and pops back in for a minute or two later on, and thats it. Its the biggest tease ever. Its hard to understand how so many other people whove seen Stripped praise it and only seem to mention that Bill Watterson is involved, never really telling you just how little hes featured.

The documentary itself isn't anything remarkable. Its standard fare for a documentary, although it does interview a good number of comic strip artists, young and old. We get a nice glimpse at the traditional methods with paper, to the more modern methods with computers and tablets, although most of the footage is of those being interviewed. They talk about how hard it was to get into the business, when only a few strips would get picked up each year, and how important the syndicates were to their success. The last third of the film is mostly with newer (internet age) comic artists, who go over what they have to do in order to make money on a platform thats just giving away content for free.

What bothered me the most about Stripped was that this couldve been done better as a short series of films, giving a couple of the artists more time with their own interviews. You have some pretty big names here, and for them to all be saying the same thing seems like a waste. Im not trying to put down their struggles or anything, but when they're all saying the same thing about making money and having a hard time coming up with ideas now and then, its like ok I get it. Can you tell me some more personal things about how your strip came to be?. Yes, this is a documentary about the profession but come on, give us a little more substance. Maybe thats why Bill Watterson is the selling point for Stripped- because theres not much else here. It took me two nights and multiple sittings to get through the whole thing because I was getting so impatient. On the bright side, I did get to finally ind out the names of some comics that Id seen online over the years without any credit.

If you have other movies in your queue, or something else to do, do that before watching Stripped. If you're looking for inspiration to keep drawing, just look up interviews with your favorite cartoonists online and go from there. Heck, go get the Calvin and Hobbes 10th Anniversary book and read all of Wattersons notes there. Thats more than enough inspiration.",1450483200,2,4178,4.489473684210527

Amazing that they got so many brilliant people to give interviews, yet refused to invest even $100 in a microphone.",1446508800,,254,5.605263157894737

Hearing Bill Watterson's voice-over marks a moment in comics history since no one has ever seen or heard the guy and this point is emphasized in the film when a caption tells us it's the first time he's ever allowed his voice to be recorded.  I always thought the less we know about Watterson the better it is for the legacy of his art and his personal absence only adds to the mystique of his creation.  Watterson is only a small part of STRIPPED which outlines the realistic fate of what many consider to be a serious art form.  Who are these grown men and women who write and draw cartoons for a living?  Can an industry that brought us good clean fun be as jagged as the lid on an opened can of Popeye's spinach?  (I was going to delete the spinach remark but who cares.. kindly roll your eyes and move on)

I was in grammar school in the mid 80's when everyone read the comics and clipped the good ones taped them to their fridge or pinned them to bulletin boards and shared them with family, friends, and co-workers.  ""Did you read 'Calvin & Hobbes' today?"" would be a common question I would hear and that was from the adults.  'The Far Side', 'Garfield', 'B.C.', 'The Wizard of Id' and 'Calvin & Hobbes' were daily must reads and in my family having to wait my turn to read the Sunday comics was a weekly ritual.  'Henry' blew me away and it only appeared in the Sunday strips and I always read that one first.  Do yourself a favor and look it up if you're not familiar with it and imagine how difficult it would be to make a strip like 'Henry' work every single time when the main character never speaks and there is no dialogue even if you only had to come up with material once a week.  Bottom line is the funnies were a part of life made possible by having the newspaper delivered to your doorstep.

Fast forward 30 years.  When was the last time you used a pay phone or listened to a cassette tape or watched a VHS movie?  When was the last time you purchased a cd or dvd for that matter?  In this documentary, STRIPPED takes on the shrinking market of syndicated comic strips as the world pays less attention to print news in favor of the instant access provided by the internet for news and entertainment.  Keep in mind Charles Shultz possibly made Charlie Brown a 1 billion dollar business.  Jim Davis of 'Garfield' may be worth $400 million dollars or more and Bill Watterson turned down hundreds of millions of dollars when he refused to license 'Calvin and Hobbes' but he still made a mountain of money in the 10 years the strip ran and keeps making from book sales which continue to this day.  I should know I just bought 2 of them.

I did something I haven't done in over a decade (and probably longer) after watching STRIPPED.  I bought a newspaper thinking most of the sections were missing but it was all there in its flimsy glory. It didn't take long to find the comics page and after my eyes adjusted to the absurd size of the panels I noticed most of today's comics were created by dead guys and the other strips I didn't recognize and NONE of them were worth the time and eye strain.  Go online and you'll get to know a different kind of eye strain from pouring over the endless stream of new material out there.  If you look long enough and hard enough you may even find a few web comics that are actually pretty good.  But unlike Shultz, Davis, Watterson or even the 'Pearls Before Swine' guy, the artists of web comics get paid peanuts.",1444521600,2,3616,4.338781575037147
8655222,3,B00K1NNK26,"I was disappointed with this DVD because every time I play it the DVD has an automatic setting to use subtitles that plays and the DVD doesn't have an Audio/Subtitle option that allows you to turn it off. Some DVD players allow you to switch the subtitles off but others don't have that option so I am forced to watch the movie with subtitles which is completely unnecessary since the audio is in English and so are the Subtitles. 99% of all DVDs have the option to turn on or off subtitles. This DVD not having that option just shows me what a poor quality product this DVD is.

The movie itself is quite fascinating and very informative. If you have a passion for Comic Strips and want to learn about them I suggest this Documentary and another one titled Dear Mr. Waterson, both of which are available on Netflix.",1434412800,,816,4.44
