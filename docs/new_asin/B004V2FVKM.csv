8442657,4,B004V2FVKM,"Smashing good music (the songs were all chart busters), a gorgeous heroine and two handsome heroes were perhaps the reason this movie became such a blockbusters. Saira Banu plays Barkha, the bone of contention between the friends turned foes Dharamendra and Rajendra Kumar. In reality, they are brothers, separated at birth. Can it get more clich than this? Saira Banu preens, pouts and screams and that is acting for her. Rajinder Kumar is good and has some great Rafi numbers to lip-synch. But is Dharamendra who is the most endearing of the lot. Unpolished yes and I think this is one of his earlier movies. But his portrayal of Ranjit remains charming and completely believable.",1304985600,,682,4.939130434782609
