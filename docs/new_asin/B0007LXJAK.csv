2219218,4,B0007LXJAK,"Mike Leigh's new film, ""Vera Drake,"" takes place in working class England in 1950.  Vera, played beautifully by Imelda Staunton, is a dowdy, cheerful, and down-to-earth woman who cleans other people's homes and also takes the time to look in on her aged mum and other assorted shut-ins.  For Vera, a cup of tea cures all ills, and she is forever putting a kettle on for someone or other. For many years, Vera has had another sideline.  She induces miscarriages for young girls who have gotten themselves in a spot of trouble.  Although she receives no money for performing these procedures, Vera is breaking the law.  However, she sincerely believes that she is performing an act of kindness for these unfortunate women.

Imelda Staunton's carriage, voice, manner, and facial expressions tell us all that we need to know about Vera.  She is selfless, hard-working, fiercely loyal to her family and friends, and completely uninterested in material possessions.  Her clothing is pilled, her hat is worn, and she hasn't seen the inside of a beauty shop in a long time.  Vera's character is in marked contrast to her sister-in-law, Joyce, a beautiful blonde who is grasping, self-centered, and mean-spirited.

Mike Leigh has done a fine job of eliciting strong performances from a stellar cast.  Vera's husband, Stan, powerfully played by Phil Davis, worships Vera, and he considers himself lucky to have such a ""diamond"" for his wife.  Alex Kelly plays Ethel, Vera's introverted and homely daughter, who is thrilled when her mother urges shy Reg, played by Eddie Marsan, to come calling.  Reg is as socially inept as Ethel and they make a perfect and somewhat comical pair.

The cinematography is terrific.  The film has a gloomy and claustrophobic feel, capturing the limited and stifling world of working class people in England after the war.  A mournful musical score provides a poignant background for the many emotional scenes in the film.

Although ""Vera Drake"" is not an obvious polemic about abortion rights, Mike Leigh clearly points out that in 1950, the fate of a wealthy young woman in trouble differed markedly from that of her penniless counterpart.  The wealthy woman had access to a clean hospital bed, doctors, and nurses, while the poor woman settled for the likes of Vera.

The film's major weakness is its heavy-handedness.  Vera is too saintly and innocent, and when the police come calling, it is obvious that she doesn't stand a chance.  The scenes of Vera being politely browbeaten by the frosty detectives and judges are a bit over the top.  However, in spite of myself, I was moved by Vera's plight and I cried my eyes out.  Its minor flaws aside, ""Vera Drake"" is still worth seeing.  It is a moving and thought-provoking film that will stay with you long after you have left the theater.",1097452800,4,2812,4.908898305084746

After that, I did saw her magical moments.
She was so great. I thought that, I mean I couldn't even thought at all, I just saw her fear and shame and and, her discontent.

2219274,3,B0007LXJAK,"Vera Drake, 2004 film

A woman walks to an apartment and opens the door to help a man in a chair. Returning home she sets the table. [These are poor people.] We see her cleaning the rooms of a wealthy woman. Men talk about their experiences in the war. Vera works at cleaning again. We see girls testing and packing bulbs in a factory. Does Vera have a heart of gold? Or a busybody? A girl comes to Vera for help. Soapy water to clean her out? A man barters packets of cigarettes for nylon stockings. A woman visits Vera with the name of a new customer. Vera does another procedure. [These scenes seem to recreate life in late 1940s Britain.] Couples dance on the floor of a ballroom. Vera visits another woman. A young girl tells about a friend who needs help, she is in trouble, and gets a written note. She visits a medical doctor, prices are discussed. Miss Wells talks to another professional about her history.

Another woman makes a deal and is given an appointment. Vera Drake sees her. There is romance for Ethel Drake, a young girl. Vera operates on a young girl. Is it safe? Pamela Barnes needs an operation. Somebody did something to her. ""These people must be stopped."" The police arrive to investigate. [Sooner or later something goes wrong.] Mrs. Barnes is questioned by the police, and talks. Lillian Clark is questioned next; she talks too. The police question Vera, who says she tried to help out girls in trouble. [No Fifth Amendment for her?] Vera shows her equipment. She goes to the police station ""to help them in their inquiries"". [No Public Defender?] The Police Inspector questions her about her past activities. Did it happen to her? ""I don't take money."" They take her statement and charge her with the crime. Will she tell her husband?

The police watch their conversation. [Does she seem too emotional? Or her own past history?] Alfred tells his family about this serious trouble. They can't tell the kids. [No mention of social conventions?] ""How could she do this?"" A Solicitor visits Vera. She appears in Court. The Inspector testifies. Bail is granted, 50. We see the family's reactions and their personalities. They talk of the overcrowded housing of the poor (a disincentive to having children?). The trial is a formality, she is convicted and given a sentence as a deterrent to such crimes. She meets others convicted of the same crime. Drake's sentence is lighter as a first offender. [Note how they follow the rules of the road on the stairs.] The family continues their lives. [No mention of the opinions of their friends and neighbors.]

There is one scene that explains the economics: 100 (or more) for a doctor's care for birth, 2 for an abortion. [No socialized medicine then? No paid maternity leave?] Using an untrained person to perform procedures is risky. Even in hospitals there are risks and serious problems. Laws, traditions, and the Hippocratic Oath all ban abortions. They are like murders that diminish a tribe. Is there too much maudlin sentiment at the end to make this a good movie? Note how some actors use their facial expressions to show the characters they play.",1355011200,,3125,4.738970588235294
2219275,5,B0007LXJAK,"I watched this movie for the first time last night, & I think it's one of the best movies that I've ever seen. All day today, I've been thinking about what I see as the basic premise of the movie: what makes a person ""good""?
  Vera Drake is a deeply caring person. Is she wrong when she helps women have more control over their lives? Her sister-in-law is happy about being pregnant; Vera is truly happy for her. But, the sister-in-law is a shallow, self-centered person. Does that make her ""better"" than one of the women that Vera has helped? Does that make her ""better"" than Vera?
  Vera's friend Lillian is the go-between for Vera & Vera's clients. Lillian takes money for setting up the abortions, but Vera doesn't know that. Is Lillian a ""better"" person because she doesn't get more involved? Lillian makes negative comments about a ""darkie"" that Vera helps. Who is ""wrong"" there?
  Where are the lines between what's ""good"" & what's ""bad""?

2219276,3,B0007LXJAK,"A very, very British film. Americans may have trouble following the accents; I certainly did. And as seems more common among the British than in Hollywood, it is a very quiet, thoughtful, slow-moving film. Poignant is the word, I think.

Vera Drake (Imelda Staunton aka Dolores Umbridge) is a London cleaning lady and caretaker of invalids in 1950. She has a heart of gold, and everyone knows it. So one of her old school chums has callously taken profitable advantage of that golden heart, referring girls ""in trouble"" to her to ""help start their bleeding."" The law calls that an abortion, but Vera does not. She also has no idea that the school chum who has the unmitigated gall to charge her for the black market goods she supplies to Vera is making money off her. She just does it to help the girls out.

One day a girl that she had given the treatment (a soapy douche) suffers complications and is rushed to the hospital. As it happens, the girl's mother recognized Vera from having worked in the same laundry with her some years ago. Under pressure (not much pressure, in fact), she tells the name to the police. The black marketeer/old school chum supplies her address under pressure from police who make note of the impressive stockpile of contraband, mostly food that was still rationed in London in 1950.

Vera is arrested in front of her family, who had known nothing of her activities. Her husband George is supportive, her daughter Ethel and Ethel's fiance Reg, are pretty quiet, although eventually Reg points out that it isn't fair; she was just helping those girls. Sanctimonious Sid, her son, is outraged. It's wrong, innit; it's killing babies.

I think it could have been edited down by about half an hour without losing anything of substance, and might have prompted four stars from me as a result.",1336694400,,1818,4.725552050473186
2219277,4,B0007LXJAK,"""Vera Drake,"" which lends subtle insight into the plight of women who needed to terminate a pregnancy during the austerity years of 1950's London, is very difficult to rate. On the one hand, the understated performances of Imelda Staunton and, indeed, the entire cast, are superb. The actor playing the husband is especially convincing, as are the sympathetically portrayed detectives and the woman police constable, who treat Vera with kindness. On the other hand, the film is so understated, with very little dramatic tension, that it moves towards an inevitable conclusion, which, in contrast with the slow pace of the film, seems abrupt. It left me with unresolved questions concerning Vera's past as well as her future.

Its message is implied rather than stated in the difference of class: the girl from a wealthy family is able to get around the strict letter of the law with connections, money, and a comfortable nursing home, while girls from the working class had to rely on dubious go-betweens, and they were lucky if they got a woman as scrupulous and good-hearted as Vera (It would have been interesting to discover what sentence the go-between--who, unbeknownst to Vera, has taken money for her services--received.).

Unlike another reviewer, I found Vera's tears to be convincing. They are the tears of a hard-working woman, who has always acted from the best motives, to aid girls who had no other options, but whose actions, when brought to light, have brought disgrace on her utterly respectable family.

The theme of ""Vera Drake"" is as serious as it is sad, but the film is by no means a downer, since its characters are portrayed with both sensitivity and grace.",1336521600,2,1682,4.9786476868327405
2219278,4,B0007LXJAK,"A finely acted film about a controversial subject, and a film that isn't quite as great in the end as it could have been. This, like so many Mike Leigh movies, has a spontaneous feel even as it methodically explores the world of social class - this time through twin plot strands (one about Vera, the other about a wealthy woman played by Sally Hawkins). Leigh is in many ways a political filmmaker - he's often commenting on some issue, and usually more than one at a time - but he isn't polemical. He doesn't preach, and that is a strength of this film. And while his sympathies do lie on one side of this issue, he allows all viewpoints a fair shake.

The acting by the entire cast is top notch, though Staunton is the standout. Watch her face during the scene at the dinner table when a policeman knocks on Vera's door - it is a marvel of subtle acting, and that single shot may well make the movie. That said, I agree with others who argue that the films last quarter is a bit disappointing. In it, Vera is essentially reduced to a perpetually weeping wreck. Emotionally accurate, perhaps, given Vera's character and circumstances, but as drama less than satisfying.",1310169600,,1171,4.497652582159624
2219292,5,B0007LXJAK,"Dripping with a raw genuineness, `Vera Drake' is a film that remains a remarkable, long-lasting morality piece for me.  Having seen it a few times now, I must say that it still shakes my own beliefs and causes me to battle myself, which is truly testament to its strength as a controversial, complex work of genius.

I've made this statement before, and nothing will ever get me to change it; I am unwaveringly pro-life.

Still, a film like `Vera Drake' approaches the touchy subject of abortion with a veneer of humanity that kind of takes you away from the controversy and causes you to look at things with slightly more objectivity than one may ordinarily.  No, this film has not changed my mind, but it is also a film that develops its characters with such profound realism that we are taken into their mind frame and forced to contemplate their actions and rationalize alongside them.  While I don't agree with Vera, I can't help but sympathize with her situation and her beliefs and so, in a way, `Vera Drake' allows the obstinately close-minded observer to think a little more open-minded.

The film follows a small segment of Vera Drake's life.  Vera is a middle-aged (well, older than middle aged I presume) woman living in London during the 50's.  She is a housecleaner and a generally sweet-natured woman who is adored by everyone she comes into contact with.  Her natural inclination to `help' others leads her to commit the atrocity that is abortion under the pretence that she is doing a good deed.  Vera truly believes in her cause and doesn't see anything wrong with her actions, despite the fact that they are, in fact, illegal.  When one of her `patients' gets very ill and Vera's secret is uncovered, her whole world crumbles before her eyes and the controversial nature of her actions becomes the gossip of family members who either support her because of who she is or despise her because of what she's done.  This concept, for me, was very poignant and really took me back.  Having recently seen this very thing unfold in my own life (figuratively, since no one I know has gotten an abortion) I can totally sympathize with all sides involved.  The son, who is fervently apposed to his mothers actions, disgusted even, has every right to be since what she has done, to him (as well as me) is inhuman.  On the other hand, the stand that Reg makes, as a simple observer, is not one to be taken lightly.  `Vera Drake' beautifully asks a very intriguing question:

Does one bold mistake instantly outweigh a lifetime of good-heartedness?

For a small cast, `Vera Drake' contains one of the finest ensembles I've seen this decade.  While there is no denying that Imelda Staunton's brilliant portrayal of Vera Drake is, and will always be, this films solid backbone, one cannot simply dismiss the supporting cast as forgettable.  Sally Hawkins (in a small yet luminous role), Eddie Marsan (far better in this tone than the one he muddled through in `Happy-go-Lucky'), Daniel Mays and the magnificent Phillip Davis all layer this film with every ounce of emotional entitlement it deserves.  Davis especially is just spectacular as the broken husband struggling to understand what has just happened to him.  But no one compares to the beautiful restraint and incomparable rawness that exudes from Staunton's every pore here.  Like I said, I've been (recently) in a similar situation (with secrets being revealed that seemed to crush down on everything around me) and so seeing the way that Staunton nervously confessed her `sins' completely blew my mind, because it was so real.  This is such a small performance, stripped of all the theatrics that many other actresses may have heaped upon the character (think Angelina Jolie in `Changling') and so it winds up feeling far more haunting than expected.

It breaks your heart.

In the end I am completely in love with this film.  I love films that make me feel something, and I love them even more if they challenge me in ways that make me either uncomfortable (in a good way) or validated, and this film kind of does both.  Mike Leigh is a director/filmmaker who is lauded and respected by many, but to be honest I have not been entirely blown away by much of his work.  This film is a completely different story.  For me, this is his best work to date; easy.",1280275200,2,4322,4.746987951807229
2219293,4,B0007LXJAK,"Imelda Staunton is fearless and superb in her role as Vera Drake, a woman who care for her family and others in post WW2 London.  She also assists women who need abortions and have nowhere else to turn. But the method she uses can cause serious problems, and this is how she gets caught.

The emotions run high in the Drake family when they find out what she has done and what kind of fate she faces.  The films also makes the viewer ponder how difficult it must have been in 1950 to deal with an unwanted pregnancy, whether the result of rape or something else.",1279843200,,562,4.283018867924528
2219294,5,B0007LXJAK,"Imelda Staunton is superb in her performance as Vera Drake, a working class wife and mother devoted to her family and friends as well as the neighborhood. By day, she works as a domestic for wealthy Londoners and takes care of her elderly mother. On the side, however, she helps women of her status to terminate unwanted pregnancies. The women who came to her to induce miscarriages were unable to provide financially or having relations outside of the marriage.
Meanwhile, wealthy women could have an abortion performed given that they had a family background of mental instability. The abortion was carried out in a facility that was clean and provided them with bedding where they could recouperate. The women in Vera's neck of the woods, weren't able to afford fancy lodgings. They were in a tight spot and outcasted for being poor.
The movie is compelling because abortion is still a debate that cuts across class, race, and even religious beliefs. Women suffered socially and economically after World War II. They were not that many opportunities for them; except for being a wife and mother; and not all women looked forward to playing that role. Many of the women in Vera's neighborhood worked in low paying jobs that could barely allow for them to make ends meet. A baby would have just been an added expense. For the wealthy woman however, being pregnant without a husband would have made her a social outcast and prevent her chances of finding a suitable husband.
Mike Leigh does a great job at exploring how women didn't have control over their body. They were expected to maintain their chastity until marriage. Women were discouraged from exploring their own sexuality and taken advantage of by an establishment that is sexist, racist, and narcissist for their personal gain. It is unfortunate in this day and age that women are still in the middle of the debate over abortion.",1279411200,,1891,4.875776397515528

2219296,3,B0007LXJAK,"Yes, the main character gives an outstanding performance, but the movie was only average otherwise.  The movie moves slowly and does not get anywhere fast.  You follow this woman as she goes about her daily life.  You see glimpses of her acquaintances here and there, but their story lines are not very deep.  You know nothing about them, who they are, or why their characters behave the way they do.  Her family life is blah.  Her daughter is so insecure she has absolutely no life outside of her parents.  The movie is very choppy.  You see her husband at work.  Her son at work.  Her daughter sitting on a couch.  Her Brother in law at work.  Her sister in law completely self absorbed and always wanting more.  Then you are introduced to other characters that you have no background on, leaving you wondering who they are and why they are there. Then abruptly she gets arrested.  Her character who had been so with it during the whole first part of the movie now loses it.  She has no emotion other than shock. She signs a confession after the police just got done telling her she has the right to not say anything.  From the moment of her arrest she has no emotion at all.  She practically cannot function.  Which is unlike her ""so with it"" character.  While in jail she asks other inmates, who are in for the same thing how long they are serving, but there is no reason why she is asking.  She doesn't use the information to her advantage to ask for a lighter sentence. The movie then just seems to end.  Overall, the movie does not have any language to worry about.  It is rated R for the subject matter (abortion) only.  The two sex scenes are very mild compared to what movies show these days.  It just was not that great of a movie to give 5 stars to.  Maybe if you have been in the same situation as the ""helper"" or as the ""women needing the service"" then you would think this is a wonderful movie?  I just cannot see it from that point of view because I have never been there in either capacity.  Other than that, and based entirely on the story alone, I can only give it three stars.

I also have to add that when the doctor tells the mother of the girl who almost died that he ""see's this every weekend"", it leads me to believe that every one of Vera Drakes abortions has made all of the girls sick.  Because her aborts are done every Friday at 5:00.  Meaning and implying that the emergencies he sees every weekend are Vera Drakes doing.  Besides how does she know what concoction leads to a miscarriage?  How does she know this is the magic potion that will do the trick?  She does say that she had this done to herself when she was young, but how would she know what chemicals to use?  The movie needed to go into more history and detail so that the viewer would have more to go on.",1251849600,,2799,4.2988505747126435

But, gee, Vera cries enough for everyone and I left the film, dry-eyed, but scratching my head, saying ""What?  Is that it?  After the looooong buildup and we don't even know what happens next?""  I felt sort of cheated. The only tear I shed was at the horribly tense Christmas family gathering after everyone knew Vera's secret, when the new son-in-law to be said that this had been the best Christmas he had ever had.  This was one of the nice human touches that the film has.

I found the first part of the film to be quite interesting.  The lives
of the working class English family in the post WWII years was very lovingly shown.  You could tell that the people had survived very hard times and the understated way they discussed the friends they had lost in the war was quite moving.

I think my main complaint is that, once Vera is confronted with her crime, she breaks down into utter misery and this one tone last through the rest of the film---at least an hour.  Unrelieved crying takes its toll on the viewer which is why I just couldn't sustain my sympathy for the character.  Dramatically, it's a bad choice.  Then...the ending...After we have lived through all the tears and the worse-than-expected verdict...what?  All we see is the family, back home in the dark house, mutely surviving.  This is not a conclusion that gives any kind of resolution or satisfaction to the viewer.  It's like sitting through three fourths of a Beethovan symphony and then the conductor puts down his baton and walks off, without the resolution of the hieghtened emotions.  Again, bad drama.

Another complaint I have is that the characters were so one dimensional.  Vera seems to be a saint and the family seems to be the picture of goodness and contentment ...but then why is the daughter so emotionally retarded?  And, more importantly...in the 20 years that Vera has been doing this, how many other girls had the same results as the one who landed in the hospital?  Since the others didn't know Vera's name, she was never traced.  She treated the procedure with the same sense of seriousness as one would for pulling a tooth. There was no followup for the girls.  Was she really that ignorant?  If so, this should have been demonstrated in the first part of the film and it wasn't.  She didn't take money for the jobs but she did accept the sardines and sweets that were still big treats in postwar England.

Yes, Imelda Staunton did a great acting job and deserved the Oscar nomination.  For her sake, if not for ours, the film should have been better.",1225411200,2,2705,4.590814196242171
2219299,4,B0007LXJAK,"Vera Drake was a highly praised 2004 film, written and directed by Mike Leigh, that detailed the cruelties and hypocrisies of England's anti-abortion laws back in post-World War Two 1950. It won the Best Film Award at the Venice Film Festival and from the British Independent Film Awards, and deservedly so. Yet, despite its `large' backdrop, the film is one of the most intimate character studies ever put to celluloid. Drake (Imelda Staunton) is an aging London housewife, with a husband, Stan (Phil Davis), and two grown children, Ethel and Sid (Alex Kelly and Daniel Mays), who goes out of her way to help girls who are pregnant have homemade abortions. She charges no money for her services, and is sent on the sly, by acquaintances who do charge money to be recommended to her, although Drake does not know this. She is a prim lady who calls and holds everyone and everything `dear'....  This film holds some truck with Alfred Hitchcock's films that focused on wrongly accused men, most notably his The Wrong Man, with Henry Fonda, but this film ends on a lighter touch. Life goes on, and, in a few years, Vera Drake will be free, yet there will have been far less scrupulous characters who will have taken her place. Laws against abortion ALWAYS target the poor, not the rich, and then society condemns the poor for having `too many kids', even as it denies them the means to not have those despised `bastards'.",1222128000,,1418,4.717741935483871
2219300,5,B0007LXJAK,"This is a carefully crafted film that captures well the struggles of the working class, the division of class in English society, social control of society, and the strength of the social and family networks that allow poor working folks to survive in the face of adversity. These complex themes are explored through a straight forward, non-complicated narrative that is enhanced with outstanding performances by the entire cast. Thefilm is neither pro-abortion or con-abortion. It offers a realistic view of the process and the players and leaves judgement to the viewer.

The compelling story and main character, Vera, keep you engaged. Vera is a cheerful, giving, warm, compassionate, loving person who is the keystone of her family and social network. Phil Davis plays her husband Stan and his performance is also of the highest level. This hardworking and honest housekeeper performs abortions for poor girls for free, seeing her actions as helpful.

The film is certainly more about social class and privilege as much as it is about illegal abortions. We see both poor and rich girls becoming pregnant and we see wealthy girls using the established medical community to assist them with an unwanted pregnancy whereas we see poor girls faced with fewer options. Likewise we see society physicians willing to perform an abortion if a rich girl happens to have suicide in the family and mentions that she is so stressed that she is thinking about suicide. The physicians are protected but the poor abortionist working to help poor girls in trouble faces considerable punishment.

Yet, the film is carefully made and the rich pregnant girl in the story evokes as much sympathy as do the pregnant poor girls in the story. They are all victims of a social structure that punishes the female if she is pregnant but is not concerned with the father of the child, be he a rich or poor man.

The police act as agents of social control in the film and yet they were highly personal and sympathetic characters. The humanity of the chief detective shone through and it was obvious that this man tries to do his duty within the confines of the law yet feels compassion for those caught in the criminal justice legal system.

So if sexism, classism are oppressive social structures, how to the poor women survive? This film would indicate that strong families and strong social networks are key to survival. We are introduced to no less than 23 characters in the first 30 minutes of the film and yet we quickly see how they are structured in the larger social network.

Vera is a vital part of her family and social network and yet when she gets into trouble, the social network first reacts with shock but then rebounds and offers the emotional and fiscal support needed to overcome the current crisis.

This is a thoughtful film. Each character is complex and well developed. There is a strong sense of justice as a human developed and delivered process. The court system seemed to impart justice, for Vera was indeed an abortionist, no matter how much you feel for this loving motherly little lady. No characters were stereotypes or cartoons. Even the arresting police are seen as part of the social fabric in which they play a role in the most humane manner possible.  After you see the film I suspect you will reflect on how well conceptualized, written, directed and performed was this dramatic presentation. Imelda Staunton's dramatic skills are immense, as were all the actors. In an odd way, this film about abortion makes you feel better about the human condition, primarily because when the forces of justice prevail, it is our common humanity and those that love us that allow us to absorb the punishment and move on.",1214179200,4,3720,4.856466876971608
2219311,3,B0007LXJAK,"Nobody captures working class England and its socially reticent inhabitants better than director/screenwriter Mike Leigh does. He brings a deeply felt authenticity to post-WWII London in the set-up of his rather controversial story, and one needs to give credit to Leigh for not turning the film into a polemic about abortion. At the same time though, the 2004 movie clocks in at over two hours, and its unrelenting bleakness has a wearing effect especially since Leigh takes a decidedly episodic approach to his story. The title character is a simple, frumpy woman, so kind-hearted that she thinks nothing of tending to those she sees as less fortunate, whether it is her mother, her invalid neighbor or the parade of mainly young girls who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies. Vera sees no distinction when it comes to helping these people selflessly, and to her immediate family, especially her loving husband, she is nothing less than a saint beyond reproach.

Leigh takes his time in establishing this fact, too much time really, and pacing is part of the movie's problem. It appears that he is intent on showing how matter-of-fact her illegal abortion practice is compared to her everyday activities with her family. To some degree, the juxtaposition of scenes maximizes the later drama of consequences and ramifications, but the results are uneven because there is nothing remotely surprising about what happens to her. The second half of the movie develops a compelling emotionalism thanks to a stunning turn by Imelda Staunton. Until the moment she is arrested, Vera seems almost like a British version of Betty White's character on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B000H6QQ8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls</a>, all apple-cheeked optimism offering a cup of tea to soothe everyone's worries. However, when Vera realizes what is happening to her, Staunton effectively uses an expression of glazed shock followed by an implosion of endless crying jags to illuminate the inner turmoil of her character. For the most part, it's an economical performance, and yet thanks to Staunton, one never questions the sheer anguish her character is experiencing.

The other actors are quite good, in particular, Phil Davis as her unsuspecting mechanic husband Stan; Daniel Mays as her enterprising son Sid, a men's store salesman; Peter Wight as the guardedly sympathetic inspector; and as two unlikely lovebirds, Alex Kelly as her hopelessly lumpish daughter Ethel and Eddie Marsan as the schlubby bachelor upstairs. In fact, his proposal scene to Ethel is a charming moment in their fumbling realization of their need for each other. Another keenly observed scene is one in which Sid deftly massages a middle-class customer's heartfelt desire to look like a swell at an important function. These are the moments in the movie that feel the most truthful, and Leigh excels at directing such scenes without pretension. Leigh wants to exalt the heroism of abortion providers during an era of extreme repression, and he makes sure to be true to the psychology of the working class at that time. Consequently, it is compelling how he keeps Vera inarticulate during the most dramatic moments, even when she's being interrogated and realizes a prison sentence is at hand.

The aim of the film is sound, but what I don't appreciate much is how Leigh uses certain characters simply to move the plot along only to drop them later, for instance, the character of Susan and her plight are introduced simply as a counterpoint to Vera's method, showing how the rich took care of their abortions. There is the revelation that Vera's friend selfishly pocketed money from the pregnant girls all those years, and we are robbed of a confrontation scene that should have occurred between her and Vera about it. One could watch the movie to savor the acting, but truth be told, the film is probably about half an hour too long, as one scene after another signals the end of this desultory story. Despite Staunton's stellar performance, I have to admit I felt relieved when it was all over. The only extra features on the 2005 DVD are the original trailer and a behind-the-scenes documentary featuring snippets of interviews with Leigh, Staunton, Davis, Mays and cinematographer Dick Pope.",1207440000,,4343,5.255043227665706
2219312,2,B0007LXJAK,"It's difficult for me to go into specifics with regard to what I found so horrible about this film because my mind apparently went into some type of state-of-shock-survival mode, I guess like what happens during any sort of severe abuse, and all that register in my memory was the fact that it was entirely unpleasant.  If you are into really slow, overly dramatic, storylines that have been ran into the ground,or feminist-hero-over-body-rights issue (etc) movies about people uplifted for being humble and simple, well, you'll have a good time, or consider scheduling a visit to your dentist.",1202774400,,594,5.061224489795919
2219313,3,B0007LXJAK,"Mike Leigh is a signature director, possibly the best British director since Lindsey Anderson. Like Anderson, Leigh has that magic touch for seeing people clearly and persuading his actors that they don't need to act. He already has a half dozen little masterpieces behind him, including numerous stage plays. My favorite is a little gem called ""Naked"" which opens in a bedroom when two young lovers are looking for that necessary ""after"" cigarette. They then sit , naked, and smoke. This is the good stuff, just the sort of thing never done in Hollywood. ""Vera Drake"" didn't do it for me this time, however, as I didn't believe in her feigned innocence and I didn't accept her claim to being a good deed doer. It is not just a matter of the politics of abortion; it has to do with the politics of taking responsibility.",1187136000,3,820,4.662068965517242

Though he's dealing with a hot-button issue, Leigh does not moralize or sentimentalize, leaving us to mull the fate of an abortionist who even the police are loath to vilify. In a movie chock-full of outstanding performances, Staunton's Oscar-nominated turn as the kindly Vera is an acting feat of rare heart and authenticity. One of Leigh's most thoughtful and emotionally hard-hitting films.",1185753600,4,626,5.3979591836734695

I'd never heard of Imelda Staunton before this movie, but her performance, especially the interrogation scenes, was so on target it earned her an Oscar nomination. (You may remember her as the disgruntled school principal in Freedom Writers). Substantial performances all around, Vera Drake is a masterpiece from start to finish. I gave this film four instead of five stars because, as with most British films, this movie simmers a tad too long. But just a tad!",1179360000,,550,4.8
2219316,2,B0007LXJAK,"Vera Drake is always cheerful:  bustling around, working hard cleaning houses for 4 employers; caring for her invalid mother; visiting shut-ins; encouraging her plain, almost pathologically shy daughter and the daughter's equally shy suitor's budding romance, and, enjoying her loving marriage.  Oh, and by the way, she 'helps out' young women who need abortions.  No questions asked, she'll just be there with her bulb syringe and her soap and disinfectant at 5:00 p.m. on Friday.  She doesn't even ask for payment.  She's just ""helping out"" women who need a 'problem' solved.

The first part of this film is the most enjoyable and interesting part, at least to me (ironically, this is the part of the film that many other reviewers didn't like).  This part focused on the lives of Vera and her family, circa 1950, working-class London.  The austerity of post-WWII British life is very carefully and thoughtfully shown.  (The abortions Vera performs are displayed like an afterthought in the lives of the ordinary --but interesting and involving-- members of this family.)  Then, halfway through the film, Vera gets arrested when one of her abortions goes very wrong.  (By the way, the word ""abortion"" is almost unused in the film.  It's always: ""helped out young women"", or some other euphemism.)  And then Vera spends the rest of the movie crying her eyes out.

All the gentle and unsentimental charm and interest (to me) of the director's depiction of postwar life in Great Britain is then completely lost.

If Vera felt that what she did was just ""helping out girls in trouble"", and she had no moral problem with it, I kept wondering: why was she crying so much?  Could it have been, maybe she now felt a LITTLE guilt, or perhaps a little sorrow?  Or is it only shock & misery over being arrested?  Or maybe, a bit of both?  Well, the film doesn't let you know.  Vera just cries.  And cries.  And cries.

I felt this film was very one-sided.  It presents a woman who's practically a saint performing abortions.  It would have been far more interesting if Vera had shades of grey to her character.  The abortion method which Vera used looked extremely dangerous, too, but that's just blown off; another abortionist in the film even says to Vera, later: ""Oh, that method works well hundreds of times!"".  Even Vera says she can't understand what could have went wrong, that one time.

The pace of the film slows drastically after Vera's arrest and there's no more of the warm, familial interaction, no more day-to-day lives of the family members.  When Vera's son indicates he would have a hard time forgiving her, because he's of the opinion that what Vera did was wrong, (he's the only one of her immediate family who is unequivocal in saying this, by the way), he's immediately shot down by his father: ""She did what she thought was right!""  Realistically, given the time period in which the story is set, surely other family members or friends might express the same feeling as Vera's son.

And, in what I consider a strong example of the director's manipulation of the viewing audience, the only other person besides Vera's son who thinks what Vera did was wrong, and says so, is her selfish, grasping, and snobby sister-in-law, who's always been just a little jealous of Vera and is not unhappy to see her brought low.  Even the film's police officers are gentle with Vera - not at all, I could not help thinking, how 'real' police would have behaved toward her, given the time and place of this story.

The performances I liked best were (ironically) the grasping sister-in-law (the actress is perfect as a selfish mean-spirited snob), and, Ruth Sheen, as Vera's black-marketeering friend, who sets up Vera's abortion appointments.  The actors who portray Vera's husband, son, daughter, and the daughter's shy suitor were also excellent.  (In one of the very nice familial moments early in the film, the shy suitor reveals just how much he appreciates the warmth that the Drake family has shown him.)  Imelda Staunton as Vera is also fine.  Her character is presented as too good to be true, but she's as touching in her bewilderment during her time of trial, as she is as the constantly cheerful, always busy and capable Vera in the beginning of the film.

I'd have been happy, despite the film's somewhat manipulative characteristics, to give it a solid 3 stars if only for its care and attention to recreating postwar Britain, and for its several interesting character studies.  But the film's drastically slower, uneven second half, force me to downgrade it to 2 stars.",1179273600,5,4582,4.840616966580977
2219317,4,B0007LXJAK,"In 1950 in London, a woman named Vera Drake is the perfect wife and mother.  She takes care of her family and anyone else in need, works as a domestic in several homes, plays matchmaker for her homely daughter.

When one of these girls is admitted to the hospital with complications from the procedure, Vera's entire world comes crashing down before her eyes.

It's easy to see why Imelda Staunton was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in this extraordinary film.  It was almost hard to watch, and the story is such that at the same time you feel allied with Vera and can understand why she made the choices that she did, you can also see why her family is so appalled by her actions.  It's difficult to say how I feel after watching this film, but it will definitely stay in your mind after you've seen it.

2219320,5,B0007LXJAK,"My review of this fabulous movie will not hold a candle to the two spotlight reviews--read them first because they are outstanding and comprehensive appraisals.  This is a film that will stay with you months after viewing it.  The director Mike Leigh's storytelling skills are compelling; you actually feel like you are watching real life.

Imelda Staunton, who we have recently enjoyed as the cook in the charming NANNY MCFEE and as the patient mother in MY FAMILY AND OTHER ANIMALS (seen recently on PBS--Masterpiece Theater) portrays the title character, Vera Drake, a middle aged woman who helps to support her family by cleaning the houses of rich people.  This hard working woman is like a good fairy, using her wand and her kindness to brighten other people's lives.  Throughout the day she goes from one task to another spreading good cheer while walking miles and climbing endless steps.  She runs errands and feeds a handicapped man and his overwhelmed wife.  She invites lonely people to her home for a good meal; she takes care of her elderly mother--all the while smiling and humming.  Her husband and two grown children also adore her and appreciate what a special person this gem is.

But Vera has a secret: she performs abortions for the poor, lonely and downtrodden of the early 1950's England.  This is a service that she has been providing for over twenty years--she doesn't accept a shilling for helping these poor girls and women.  Something eventually goes wrong and a young lady almost dies.  When the police come to arrest Vera, we are treated to the most riveting performance I have ever witnessed.  The pain that Vera feels is palpable and is transferred to the viewer.  Just watching Imelda's performance made me feel as if my heart was ripped from my chest. This was an Oscar worthy presentation, absolutely stunning.

This movie is about a woman who happens to perform abortions--it does not promote this deed, nor does it vilify it.  It is just a poignantly told story that I absolutely adored.

At the end she gets arrested and goes to jail. That's a whole story. No dramatic twist, no character development, no historical backdrop that would tell us something about views of the time--this one is a big miss, because movie might have been more interesting if introduced views of politicians, church, judges, average women.

2219336,5,B0007LXJAK,"Imelda staunton is utterly brilliant in the role of Vera, a cheery, easy going Mother figure from a working class family of 1950's England. The film introduces us to, and guides us seemlessly through the silent social order of Middle and Working class lives and indicates just how much silent power Women had.

Many British post war themes are presnt, the narrow expectations of women of all classes, the first waves of West Indian immigration and the disenfranchised feeling among the people involved, heavy black marketering and the ongoing effects of poverty and rationing (the latter two lasting well into the late 50's).

Vera is the Happy Matriarch of her Family and provides an unoffical social care role to and aged Mother of her own and several lonely elderly folk on her estate (the kind of care which is now professionalised and managed to the point of stupidity), she scrubs and cleans for wealthy Ladies who trust her implicitly. She harbours what could be viewed as a dark secret, as along with a rather mercinry friend, she carries out pregnancy terminations for girls in trouble, in these pre-effective contracepetion days when sexual pleasure was taboo but one of few people had.

Vera's involvemnet in this operation undoubtedly comes from a place of love and concern for these girls and this is aptly portrayed giving a contempary resonance to the role and definite need for legalised abortion sometimes.

Her story is cleverly juxtoposed with that her rich bosses daughter who falls pregnant following what can only be described as date rape.

This girl has the resources to have a hushed, Harley Street termination in times when abortion was still illegal in Britain.

While the film is a brilliant historical documentry it rings with contempary resonance inasmuchas there can be seen to be no clear and precise argument either for nor agaisnt the practice of termination. The support cast are wonderful, particularly Vera's sound family, her sinister friend who helps the process and extorts payment from girls, a fact Vera is unaware of and the sympathetic police investigators. Staunton is the central and most compelling actor however, I defy audiences not be moved by and sympathetic with her cause and viewpoint.

I won't mention the plot, because, if your reading this, you already know. Imelda Staunton is, indeed, magnificent. I only recently saw the film, and at Oscar time last year I thought she'd win, because of the slug-fest that seems to involve Swank & Bening, the only times they'd been involved. I thought the votes would be split, as often happens. Imelda was gracious, glorious, sweet and down to earth in this performance, a true amalgam of acting prowess. Mike Leigh also used Brenda Blethyn to good advantage in ""Secrets & Lies"". A terrific story and interesting part of history, this film is wonderful, especially regarding the other characters involved, all of whom are excellent. Mr. Leigh is brilliant, and he uses women characters well; I hope he will soon get away from that improvisational tool that requires women to whimper and cry a bunch. Imelda's whimpering was annoying, but, in ""Secrets & Lies"", Blethyn's was distracting. Still, a wonderful display of acting, and about a good person with good intentions which were, unfortunately, against the law. I am pro-life, to a point; I almost understood Vera's motivations, especially regarding rape. Back in the early 50's, frivolous behavior wasn't as accepted as now, and Vera was there to be a friend.

And the main character's seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her.

If this is intended to be an issue movie with the message Robert Ebert has suggested (that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women), it's taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows. Munich and Syriana also ""bring to light"" ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world. Perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things.

2219342,5,B0007LXJAK,"Given the plot description, I expected to watch a movie about some rabid pro-choice crusader taking on the evil, oppressive government to do right in the world.  The plot turned out to be much more complex, with less well-defined villains and heroes.  Vera was a saint for thinking only of saving young girls from pain and disgrace, without thinking of accepting money, right?  But she also put people's lives at risk and broke the law.  She had no training or credentials, and she was surprised to find out how against the law her actions were.  The police weren't villains, but public servants entrusted to enforce the law.  Abortion law is a larger social issue still being fought in modern Western society, and this movie is a shining example of how it affects people on a micro, personal level.

Especially at the beginning, the pacing of this movie is a bit slow, but the complete journey makes the viewing entirely worth it.",1135641600,3,931,4.745341614906832
2219343,5,B0007LXJAK,"Mike Leigh's Naked has long been one of my favorite films, and he's finally produced another in its league. Once again, the sympathy and understanding he and his actors elicit for those most of us would reflexively condemn makes for a film experience that should stay with you for a long, long time. And his recognition of the humanity we all embody and share goes beyond quirky or risible individuals--it includes a class consciousness that Americans could learn from. I can't say it better than a reviewer, Joanne Laurier: ""Leigh is a genuine and honest artist who, unlike many contemporary filmmakers, does not utilize the plight of the downtrodden as a device for evoking the sneers and titillation of middle-class audiences."" The film's contempt for blind justice is a good shock too--as Leigh so fully understands, while the justice system should indeed care about what people do, it should also care more about why they do it.",1134777600,3,933,4.949044585987261
2219354,5,B0007LXJAK,"I wholeheartedly agree with the many reviewers who rightly suggested that Imelda Staunton should have received an Oscar for this simply stunning performance. The other striking performance came from Helen Coker, who played WPC Best, the Woman Police Constable who was so intelligently sympathetic and respectful to Vera, as were some of the male officers.

This haunting movie, set in 1950s England, is chillingly relevant even today, as Bush's self-righteous Bible thumpers are poised to overturn Roe Vs Wade and plunge American women back into the Dark Ages. If that, what will be next? Inquisition 2, and another 9 million 'menstrual murders' (The Wise Wound)?

These are strong words, I know. They need to be. As hinted at in Vera Drake, the wealthy American Conservatives know that they can always send their pregnant daughters up to Canada for legal abortions, while poor women will be left with unthinkable options of the kind employed by Vera Drake.

Abortion should never be treated lightly. It is a haunting, life-changing decision for the vast majority of women who find themselves in the position of having an unwanted pregnancy; and the handful of women who repeatedly use abortion as a form of birth control should be sterilized on principle.

An unforgettable movie. Let's hope we never see the likes of those days again. If we do, the troops currently out in Iraq might be needed on the streets of the US.",1131235200,9,1421,4.9831223628691985
2219355,5,B0007LXJAK,"This quietly powerful film tells the story of a 1950's middle-class English family, as it is torn apart by the actions of one woman. Vera Drake, the mother is her family's emotional center. A small woman, with bright blue eyes and always a kind word, Vera bustles through her days doing odd favors for housebound invalids, always making the world a bit friendlier for the lonely souls she meets along the way. But Vera has another side, although even this task is carried out with her usual gentle reserve: Vera helps women with troublesome pregnancies. For years, Vera has visited the women who need her services. Inevitably one girl becomes deathly ill and the police show up on Vera's doorstep just as her family is celebrating her daughter's engagement. Vera instinctively knows why the authorities are there, but has never spoken a word about her activities to her husband or grown children. Devastated over the girl's illness, Vera breaks down, barely able to speak to the inspector or to tell her husband what she has been doing.

Filled with character actors whose faces reveal their every emotion, this film is brilliantly acted, more implied by what isn't said than the damning words of jurisprudence. Imelda Staunton plays a remarkable nuanced Vera Drake, a simple woman, devoted to her family. Confronted by her actions, Vera literally cannot cope with the overwhelming emotions, as though she hasn't thought past her actions. The family is unbelieving, offering various reactions: ""It's dirty.""; ""If you can't feed 'em, you can't love 'em, can you?""; ""If she told me I would've put a stop to it."" The film makes no judgments, other than the obvious illegality of Vera's actions; the scenes speak for themselves, women preparing for Vera's ministrations, each with her own burden, fear, guilt, a sense of the forbidden, furtively taking Vera into their dank, moldy flats. In contrast, a wealthy young woman has other resources for an unwanted pregnancy, a legal recourse, with a psychiatrist giving approval and a doctor performing the procedure. This one scene points to the vast differences of privilege and poverty.

The cinematography dramatizes the danger and fear, stark images of Vera trudging up and down flights of stairs in dreary tenements, comforting frightened women, working as a domestic in the homes of the wealthy, the inspectors converging on Vera's home, large men, their overcoats flapping, as imposing as a procession of clerics and just as intimidating, although the police treat the woman with every courtesy. Vera Drake is a stunning film, an unbiased look at the 1950's and the somewhat draconian measures of the law, a fascinating depiction of people caught in circumstances that overwhelm them and the measures they resort to for relief.

2219356,4,B0007LXJAK,"The strength of Mike Leigh films is its stark reality that convinces you of the authenticity of characters and atmosphere they live in.  Sometimes he goes too far, leaving the story he should tell far behind, and making the viewing experience a very tough one, but the emotional power of his films cannot be denied.

Things do not change in 'Vera Drake' a film set in 1950, post-war England.  The situation sounds drab, and the film looks in fact very drab.  But Vera herself is a cheerful woman, hard-working, caring, and always smiling.  Her husband Stan is told by his brother that he is a lucky man to choose her as wife, and Stan knows it is true.

But little did he and her entire family know about what Vera was doing for pregnant ladies who do not want to have babies.  What she was doing had been prohibied by the law since 1861, and when the police knocks on the door of her apartment room, she instantly realizes the meaning of it.

Then, almost stifling moments follow, and I confess that though I admire the director's and actors' skills, it was hard for me to keep on watching.  Still I kept watching, because of the first-rate acting, and Imelda Staunton (who was comical in 'Shakespeare in Love' as the Nurse) gives Oscar-worthy performance as Vera Drake.

Most of the actors are excellent (though I found the younger ones are weaker).  In spite of the special appearance of Jim Broadbent, it is Peter Wight who shines as Detective Inspector, who knows he has to do his jobs, but also understands Vera's situation instinctively and treats her kindly.

The film is about Vera and the people surrounding her, and while we know what is coming in the second half, we are drawn to it despite the film's somber tone.  That's Mike Leigh film, and not everyone would like it, but I can assure you the characters and the acting that support them are a real thing.",1128729600,4,1870,4.546268656716418
2219357,5,B0007LXJAK,"Vera Drake is set in post-war 1950's and starts out as a lovely film about an endearing, kind, caring older woman, almost the ideal grandmother.  Then we are introduced to the subject of the film, abortion.  But the way this is done really shows the broad range of people involved with that issue, from judges and police, to psychiatrists and money-grubbing profiteers and somewhere in there is the lovely well-intentioned Very Drake who truly convincingly does what she does out of 'love' for troubled young women.  Its a fabulous film on so many levels, inviting us to question just how dangerous the actions of even the best-intentioned people can sometimes be.  On another level its about responsible medicine and the dangers of non-medical people assuming knowledge in medical areas with no recall or follow up for those they 'treat'.  The ultimate victims here end up being the family and the film captures brilliantly Vera as the blind optimist who seems never even to have considered this side effect of her actions.  Its a powerful film which seems almost politically neutral on the subject and yet manages to shed light on every facet of it in the most starkest of ways.",1128470400,4,1180,4.875

She works in multiple households as a cleaning lady, she pampers her husband and kids and takes care of her elderly mother.  All this with a smile on her face and cheery words of encouragement to all she meets.  She is an angel, the kind of person that you would consider yourself blessed to know.

Vera's kindness is also her downfall: for years she has been performing secret (even from her husband), free abortions on women/girls with sad stories.  Her luck runs out and the cops arrest her.

As interesting as the story is it's still not enough to fill 125 minutes.  One hundred would have been better.  I tried, I tried real hard, but by the end my mind was wandering.  Wonderful performances by everybody though especially Imelda Staunton.  She should have won the Best Actress Oscar.

2219360,4,B0007LXJAK,"Before I watched ""Vera Drake"" I had no question in my mind that Hilary Swank was the Best Actress of last year for ""Million Dollar Baby"". No question. Halfway through ""Vera Drake"", I wasn't so sure anymore. To really break down ""Vera Drake"" into its simplest elements for an American audience this is a movie starring actors most of us have never heard of, set in 1950's London, about an older lady who performs illegal abortions. For this movie to sell itself effectively the lead actress really has to be someone special. She is.

Vera Drake (Imelda Staunton) works as a maid for wealthier families. She is exceedingly friendly and everyone seems to like her. Another character calls her a busybody and she is, but she is also the kindest lady anyone is ever going to meet. Her whole life is cheerfully serving other people and she is happy with who she is. We meet her family and there is a certain amount of dysfunction, but the family is very close. This is the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, and then we get the first shot of Vera's other life. She goes down a dark alley and knocks on a door. She is let in by a young woman and led down a dark hallway where Vera reassures that young woman and ""helps her out"" because she ""is in trouble"". Free of charge, but with crude (though relatively humane) instruments, Vera helps induce a miscarriage.

To reveal more about the movie's plot would do a disservice to the film. It is a very low-key affair but with each passing minute I was more and more impressed with the work of Imelda Staunton. The character of Vera Drake initially seems to be something of a simpleton, but as we learn more we see that she is a good hearted woman doing something daring and as she sees it, necessary. Staunton is able to tell a story just in the natural facial expressions that Vera has as she reacts to situations, and in several critical scenes her face really does move the film and the viewer. These are instances of acting without moving and it really is impressive to watch. During the first twenty minutes or so I was really struggling to find any sort of interest in this movie, but after that I was completely sold on the story and the performances and bought into what was on screen. Excellent movie, with a standout performance from Staunton.",1126137600,6,2298,4.4821002386634845
2219361,5,B0007LXJAK,"I really wasn't that bothered about watching this film as I've always found Leigh's movies to be a bit of a mixed bag, and at many times a little depressing; and this sounded depressing! However, after a recommendation from a friend, I decided to watch it and I found this it not the least bit depressing, and better than his excellent Secrets and Lies. This is not your Hollywood over-dramatized, must be a message, keep audience on the edge of their seats movie (and I love them as well). This is a small microcosm, perfectly considered, beautifully constructed story, showing the cause and effects of a particular women's well intention but illegal actions and without making any wild statements or judgments about the morality of said actions (Moore should remember this when he makes a 'documentary').

In terms of characterization, I often disagree with the working class biased that Leigh portrays in some of his movies, but here, London in the 50's, it is nigh perfect, having been brought up in North London in the early 60's myself, for me his visualization was extremely accurate: I could directly relate to actions and reactions of many of the characters.

Some people have stated that they were unsatisfied by the end and I must say that after the movie had finished I too felt a bit unsatisfied, if not downright annoyed, until I thought it through and realized that the film's ending was exactly as it should have been, no Hollywood hyperbole, this is probably what would have happened in those times. Leigh just lays it out there for you, a rare treat.

Finally Imelda Staunton is superb in this role, giving one of the finest pieces of dramatic acting I have seen. I loved Million Dollar Baby, but Staunton's acting here is in a different league than Swank's excellent role. Staunton's been around for a while in Comedy and drama, but this is by far the best role I've seen her in (and would be for any actor, who could pull this off).

Controversial subject made into an excellent movie with great acting what more could you ask for? Looking forward to seeing it again. I may even be looking forward to Leigh's next movie!",1125014400,4,2140,4.713903743315508

2219363,3,B0007LXJAK,"I really wanted to like this movie, and I suppose I would be fair in saying that I did like it.  But I didn't love it, nor am I likely to watch it again.  Abortion is a sensitive topic, and this film presents it in a manner that isn't pro-life, pro-abortion, or pro-chice.  Vera Drake does not view it as right or wrong, but merely a situation in which she can help girls out.  At first it was hard for me to understand why such a seemingly good and honest woman would do something so horrific, but when her history/background is revealed, it suddenly makes so much more sense.  I like the fact that the film did not pressure you into thinking that abortion was good or bad, but merely presented the facts as they were.  Imelda Staunton was simply amazing in this film!  I cannot stress what a wonderful actress she is.  Yet the film was terribly slow-moving, the dialog was oftentimes hard to understand, the sound in the film was a little annoying (loud during the music and low during the dialog).  The ending was very anti-climactic, leaving me to think, ""That's it?  That's what I waited two hours to see?""  So overall, a good film that is worth seeing once, but I simply cannot give it a five-star rating.",1119830400,10,1211,4.40990990990991
2219374,5,B0007LXJAK,"It may come as a bit of a surprise for those of us in middle or later life to think that period films are already being made of the 1950s, yet, in some ways, Vera Drake is just that.  Most such films are driven by meticulous attention to detail in costume and fashion and most of them fail precisely because they cannot capture in dialogue and thematic content the atmosphere and meaning of the times they are trying to depict.  This is where Vera Drake differs from run-of-the-mill A & E type costume dramas.
Mike Leigh's objective appears to be to try and break down the stereotype of the post-war Britain as a time of ""happy families"" in favour of showing that gender-based oppression was part of the moral fabric of the time.  It centres around the actions of a woman extraordinary only in her ordinariness: Vera Drake.  We are shown how she typifies decency and compassion in everyday situations.  She cares for an aged mother, supports her children and neighbours, and loves her husband.  She seems beyond reproach until we learn about a dirty little secret: Vera Drake performs abortions.  But please do not get the wrong impression: Vera Drake is not a revisionist film per se.  2005 cannot redeem 1950 here, and director Mike Leigh understands this implicitly.
It is not my purpose here to give away the film's outcome, and this is not, in any case, a film where ""outcome"" is the only matter of concern.  This film captures in a subtle, skilled manner what it must have been like for people such as Vera Drake and her family once the dirty little secret has come out.  It uses dialogue that is flawlessly accurate for the period in which it is being spoken.  It is cinematically no less than a work of art:  For evidence of this, one merely needs to consider a scene in which Leigh uses a multiple mirror in the background as a means of reflecting the fractured personality of a character in the foreground.  Leigh's actors demonstrate role-playing skill you will not see in any recent Hollywood film.
The story is moving, but not sentimental.  Leigh doesn't rely on a violin-heavy soundtrack to cue the audience into feeling a reaction, because the dialogues and performances achieve a degree of authenticity that one comes across only rarely.
Regardless of how few or many people catch on, Vera Drake is a masterpiece which deserves the highest recommendation.",1118966400,14,2371,4.723300970873787
2219375,5,B0007LXJAK,"I add my voice to the swell of others who have acclaimed Mike Leigh's powerful period piece, ""Vera Drake,"" as an extraordinary film. Writer-director Leigh, (""Topsy Turvy,"" ""Secrets and Lies""), is one of the most consistent forces in cinema today, and seems to have a magic touch with his actors, especially when working with morally complex drama. Imelda Staunton, as ""Vera Drake"" gives one of the most brilliant, and accomplished performances I have seen by an actor on the large screen, and her role is an emotionally wrenching one. The subject matter of this 1950's based drama is highly controversial - abortion. Yet, as difficult as the material is, Leigh and Ms. Staunton are able to make some powerful statements without taking a position. Leigh doesn't delve into the morality aspect of the issue. Instead he explores how the disclosure of Vera's illegal acts impacts the lives of the people who care for her and depend upon her.

Vera works hard as a domestic servant in post WWII London. A tiny woman, she is a bundle of energy and optimism who exudes warmth and compassion. With great sincerity, she unstintingly gives of herself and her time to help others. She continually looks in on family and neighbors, especially the elderly and infirm, to make sure they have what they need. Vera is the backbone of her family, which includes her adoring husband, Stan (Phil Davis),  son Sid, (Daniel Mays), a tailor who fancies himself a man about town, and daughter Ethel, (Alex Kelly), a timid factory worker. Vera is their hearthstone, and the person who truly lights up their lives, a solid presence, full of good cheer and the ever present cuppa.

Unbeknownst to those who love her, Vera has been ""helping-out young women"" for years. She assists them to end their unwanted pregnancies. Vera has never discussed her work with her family, because she sees this as a confidential matter between herself and each woman she helps. I am sure, however, that she is aware of the moral issues involved in her ministries and the social stigma attached to them. The women she treats are from the working class, like Vera, and are either poor and married with too many hungry mouths to feed, or young and unwed. Vera does this work free of charge - and this is important to the storyline. It is implied that she began practicing abortion when she herself became pregnant as a girl and ""needed help"" herself.  She refuses to use the word ""abortion"" because she does not see that as what she does. The procedure she uses has proved to be reliable and never before caused physical harm to anyone - that is, none of her young women ever needed hospitalization.  A supposed friend, who is the middle-person between Vera and these women, has been charging on the sly, saying nothing to Vera, who would not take the fee and would insist on returning it.

Some will undoubtedly look upon Vera Drake as a criminal, others as a voice of hope in the wilderness. What is always clear is that she is sure that she is working for the good. However, when the police become involved, Vera finds herself in serious trouble with the British legal system. An element critical to the story, is that Vera has almost caused a death, and she is devastated when she learns of this. The police are not portrayed unsympathetically, however, although those who judge Vera and the law, itself, appear to be the villains here - at least this is the way Leigh writes and directs the film.

There is an interesting side story which runs parallel to Vera's. The daughter of one of her wealthy employers is raped. She has no idea that the woman who scrubs her Mum's floors can help her, and so goes to a ""society doctor."" With clearance from a psychiatrist, she is able to obtain an abortion in hospital, illegal though it may be, with no fuss at all. She has the  money handy, 100 pounds, quite a bit more than a working girl would ever have at one time, and money and social position, (her dad works for the Defense Ministry), are what it takes to make things happen.

Ms.  Staunton, credibly transforms herself from a jaunty, cheerful, loving woman to a bent, aged, depressed and very humiliated person in a matter of hours as the police disturb a family gathering, her daughter's engagement party. Frequently her facial expressions alone communicate a world of words. She won the best-actress prize at the Venice Film Festival, and the film, was named best picture of the festival.

Interestingly, Leigh, who was born in 1943, dedicates the film to his parents, a doctor and a midwife. I am sure he knows and understands the film's subject well.

First abortion, wow thats interesting.  4th abortion, yawn. Have a cup of tea, another abortion, ohh no the cops.

There wasn't really any conflict until the end of the movie when the cops show up at Vera's doorstep. It goes from smiles to tears, and more and more tears.  Vera crys and mumbles. The end.

Nothing really happens in this movie.

2219377,5,B0007LXJAK,"A great movie from the consistently excellent Mike Leigh, who gave us Life is Sweet, Naked, Secrets and Lies, and Topsy-Turvy. Leigh is one of the most ungimmicky directors around, and such discretion is a key part of Vera Drake's success. The camera is almost always at eye level or thereabouts, giving the entire picture a very human perspective. The story unfolds in a very straightforward manner. The only diversions are the story of the budding romance between Vera's daughter and a veteran, and the efforts of her brother and sister-in-law to start a family. Both serve well as narrative foils for the development of the central drama of Vera's efforts to help young women and the cost she must bear for doing so. Here's a strange fact from IMDb: ""Except for Imelda Staunton, none of the actors knew that the film was about abortion until their characters find out. Each actors only knew what concerned their characters."" Here's another one: ""Filmed with no script, the film went on to be nominated for Best Original Screenplay for 2005 Oscar. Mike Leigh said that he ""had to prepare the screenplay so it can be sent out to academy members. But actually the screenplay that was nominated doesn't exist. The film is the screenplay.""

The film being an almost complete success, I can only assume that this strategy was a significant factor that helped make it work. It certainly contributed to the scene of Vera's initial questioning, as well as the extraordinary exchange between Philip Davis and Daniel Mays following Vera's detainment. Every performance is masterful, although Imelda Staunton's certainly does stand out, and not awarding her the Oscar for best actress makes about as much sense as withholding the Oscar from The Aviator for best picture. Lesley Manville is wonderful as the begging-to-be-despised Mrs. Wells and Simon Chandler is equally good as her abiding and yet complacent husband.

Its tremendous aesthetic achievement notwithstanding, Vera Drake is an extremely difficult film to watch. The various abortions performed on wretched women in dilapidated surroundings are particularly miserable, and for all Vera's humanity and good will she seemed to me remarkably unconcerned with their psychological distress. I don't think this quite squares with the many, many instances of her kindness in almost every other situation. Nor do I buy the usual chatter about the non-political nature of the film. Where Leigh stands on the issue of abortion is perfectly plain, and the fact that he endows the title character with a naive saintliness right out of a child's picture book of holy women robs the film of any chance at dealing honestly with the inner life of his heroine. Compare this with Claude Chabrol's ""Une affaire de femmes,"" a movie as equally difficult to watch, but which assumes a great deal more moral complexity in the main character. That Leigh's film is a greater success in terms of its story, its acting and its simple mise en scene is a testament to his and his actors' achievement, but let's not kid ourselves about the politics.  Highly recommended.

And to the suits over at New Line, please, please release Leigh's earlier film 'Naked' on DVD.  Surely an organization that can get out another Martin Lawrence fiasco and an Adam Sandler Nice & Naughty Gift Pack can find the resources to issue an authentic masterpiece.",1117411200,4,3365,5.01252236135957

There is no happy ending here.  It is not a feel good movie, but just the same it is beautiful.  I believe Imelda Staunton was nominated for an Oscar for this role.

Final Grade: A

This was an amazing film about a nice little old lady doing something she believed was right. She was so innocent in her ways that she did not realize the gravity of what she was doing. Or perhaps she did but truly did not feel any remorse or wrongdoing in what she did. The acting from Imelda Staunton was superb (no wonder she was nominated for so many awards), and the story itself is extremely sad but holds a powerful message. It offers no strong conclusion, but leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether the fate of Vera Drake was fair or not.

I have my own views on abortion (which most of you know that I am strongly against it), but I can't help but appreciate the message this movie brings forth. It reminded me of The Cider House Rules in that its message gave some hint to how pro-choice people feel. It is important to me to understand controversial issues before making firm opinions on them, but even then I am never for sure, because I strongly believe that it is up to the individual to believe what they wish to believe. I am anti-abortion, but I don't think my views should be enforced on people who feel differently.

2219380,5,B0007LXJAK,"This is an important movie about the moral dilemma posed by abortion. Abortions, legal or illegal, have always been performed, and women from all social strata, have always found themselves in need of a helping hand, whether the law upheld that kind of help at particular times or not. The movie shows this by juxtaposing the women whom Vera Drake helps, who cannot pay for abortion, with those who can pay to have an abortion done by a doctor, or by showing that in some cases at least, abortion cannot be totally repudiated. We witness two such cases in the film as one woman becomes pregnant, we understand, after a man forces himself on her, or as another woman, who already has seven children, and whose husband just doesn't understand how consuming this is, cannot have an eighth. The film convincingly shows how women have to deal with their problems in secrecy, in back chambers, and continue to live life as usual and pretend that these things don't happen.

Vera Drake is a kind and generous woman, too kind and too generous, the movie shows, for the world surrounding her, the cruelty of which is encapsulated in the woman who procures ""clients"" for her, pocketing money from these women without Vera's knowledge, as well as doing Vera the favour of selling her various food products (such as sugar) of which, we understand, there was a shortage in those postwar years.

Imelda Staunton gives an overwhelming performance, exhibiting Vera's kindness, reliability, generosity, naivete, heartbreak, sense of shame, and, finally, despair, with great credibility. I agree with some of the other reviewers who state that the movie doesn't try to take sides. And yet I think that the police detective and the woman police constable's kindness to Vera suggest that they feel sympathy for her and even understand what she did and why she did it. I especially felt that as a woman, the female PC knows that this is a problem all women are in danger of encountering, and this could be a pointer towards interpretation of the movie. I don't know whether this is what the director intended to suggest, but I think that this is something that came across, the way I saw it at least. This is possibly one aspect of the strength of this film, that it allows for this interpretation.

All performances were riveting and convincing, the cinematography superb, the 50s austerity convincingly recreated. As some reviewers have already noted, the film is quite bleak and depressing. It is supposed to be, given the subject that it treats. It is a matter of the viewer coming prepared for a film which tackles a hard to swallow, painful, yet central,social issue. The series of abortions that Vera performs is emotionally draining, though not graphic, and the end is demoralizing. But all the more realistic and powerful in being so.

I highly recommend the film, provided the viewer knows what to expect. It's not meant to be a feel good movie, but a movie to make one think and debate. It may depress you to some extent, but I don't think it will leave you indifferent. Personally, I felt that the film is subtly but convincingly suggesting that there is no use trying to pretend that abortions don't happen / shouldn't happen,won't happen, and that the law and society do not / did not have the compassion necessary to deal with this problem faced by women. You may come to a different conclusion, but the point is that the film is strong enough to provoke discussion and possibly disagreement amongst its viewers.",1116460800,7,3506,4.799668874172186
2219381,5,B0007LXJAK,"What a difficult pleasure ""Vera Drake"" is.  It is a film that has great acting and writing, yet deals with a controversial subject that is no less hard to approach now than it was in 1950, when the story takes place.  The word ""abortion"" isn't even mentioned until the film is near it's end, but the watcher knows precisely what is being dealt with long before that.

Imelda Staunton is truly powerful in the title role, a simple woman who only wants to help others.  As soon as she appears on the screen, one is drawn into her life and family.  We follow Vera as she does what she can to make life easier for those around her.  We see the consequences of Vera's ""assistance"" in areas that the world she lived in hadn't figured out how to deal with yet. In the end, I left the film wondering why we still haven't come to grips with this issue 55 years after the events in this film took place.",1116115200,3,893,4.254437869822485

I did enjoy the acting and the glimpse into a simpler time of human emotion and understanding. A glimpse of the more things change, the more they stay the same.

2219385,5,B0007LXJAK,"Like all his films, Mike Leigh is writer/director, though in reality his approach is to rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, and let his actors build their characters and improvise.  It works wonders in 'Vera Drake,' especially in the way that process has brought a sense of cohesiveness to the on-screen Drake family.  You'd swear Imelda Stanton (as lead Vera Drake) and Alex Kelly (as daughter Ethel) were real-life mother and daughter.  Similarly, you'd stake a bet that Phil Davis and Adrian Scarborough (as Vera's husband Stan and his younger brother Frank) were blood brothers off-screen.  They look alike, act alike, and demonstrate brotherly loyalty to each other in a manner we can all identify  with.  Most importantly, without any Hollywood affections, we clearly see that the heart of the Drake family is the loving realtionship between husband and wife.  These are two real people who, 27 years after their wedded union, count their blessings each night at whatever fate drew them together.  It all seems palpably real.

The subtle parallel that Leigh draws here is difference between how to handle an unwanted pregnancy in 1950 for the 'haves' vs. the 'have-nots.'  Those with 100 - 150 pounds can go the 'official' obstetrician route.  Those who can't are steered furtively towards in-home practitioners like Vera Drake.  There's an obvious difference in the cleanliness and efficacy of the medical care; but Leigh counterbalances that by comparing the cold, callous approach of the official route vs. Drake's tender care.  We see rich girl Susan (Sally Hawkins) go through a process of, frankly, extreme humiliation - secretly raped, forced to divulge the details, shipped to a psychiatrist, her sanity questioned, sequestered alone in a remote, austere building.  In short, she's subjected to torrents of guilt and blame.  Leigh's message seems to be:  this is the 'better' approach?

The acting in 'Vera Drake' is superb on every level.  Ms. Hawkins is one representative example.  She's in two 2004 releases I've now seen back to back: this one and 'Layer Cake.'  In 'Cake,' she plays a low-level gangster named 'Slasher'...about as far removed from her role in 'Drake' as you can possibly imagine.  When I saw those two roles pop up back-to-back on her IMDB filmography, it stunned me.  How could that possibly be the same person?  What spectacular range.",1114992000,4,2368,5.141361256544503
2219386,5,B0007LXJAK,"Let me confess, I switched off the movie half-way through because I found it difficult to see the film ...it was too gray and sombre a subject for me. However, the next day I decided to see the film in one sitting and I am happy that I decided to see the film. This is one of the best films of the year, and it was worth every minute of it. If the actors, director, and the crew of a movie have you convinced on the story line, and you get into a heated debate after the movie...you know that you have just seen a really great film. Films, like stories, are a reflection of what goes in our society, and Vera Drake does a brilliant job of capturing the subtle naunces and undercurrents in the post World War II British society with warts and all. Suspend your political ideology and values for a while when you see this film.

This is a period film of sorts which has no shades of brilliant colors, just varying hues of gray and black in keeping with the painful and sober theme of the movie. Vera Drake (Imelda Stauton) is a caring wife and mother, who fusses about her family and neigbors. During the day she works as a maid in upper class homes, and every Friday she helps out the poor girls of their unwanted pregnancies at no charge. In the 1950s England abortion was illegal, and often poor women resorted to unreliable methods for abortion. Unfortunately one of Vera's abortion procedure goes wrong, and it is downhill from there.

This is a story of Vera, a simple lady who does not subscribe to any political ideology or values, but is just driven by a notion to help poor girls. Not for a single minute does it occur to Vera that what she might be doing could land her in trouble and ruin hers and her family's life. There are few human beings that are cut from the same cloth as Vera, who are humane and empathize with people regardless of your race and class. This movie makes you realize what unconditional help is all about, and how difficult it is give that on a consistent basis.

Imelda Stauton dominates every frame of the film and has rendered a fine, nuanced and powerful interpretation of the character. Stauton should have been awarded the Oscar for this film.",1114473600,2,2182,4.382716049382716
2219387,4,B0007LXJAK,"This was a movie on universal themes.  Basicaly, is ignorance an excuse for doing harm, or at least the potential for harm.  No one could possibly questions Vera's motives, but the validity of her judgement is not as clear.

When dealing with fooling the female body in order to induce a miscarriage, there are necessarily situations which can be dangerous, or even fatal to teh patient.  Vera was a rather unsophisticated woman, whose very being seemed to be directed towards goodness: with her family, with strangers in the neighborhood, or with unknown girls in need.

Her method was very simple, and in most cases apparently accomplished its desired effect without complications, although we don't really know that.  It seems that there was no follow-up.

There were medically approved opportunities to take care of unwanted pregnancies in England at the time, although they did have financial costs associated with it.  So, was Vera's innocence regarding the potential results of her actions counterbalanced by the need for women to eliminate unwanted pregnancies who were not able to raise the 150 pounds or so required . . . she did not use a coat hanger or any other implements . . .

Most of her family stood by her, having a deep love for her, and knowing that love means just that . . and is unconditional.

And the point was made, and made very clearly and creditably, that one of the worst thing a woman can do is bring into the world an unwanted and unloved child . . .

A very good movie, leaving the viewer to consider the correctness of Vera's actions and the consequences . . . a not very easy task . . .",1114300800,3,1622,4.636363636363637

2219391,5,B0007LXJAK,"It's hard to imagine an ""abortion film"" that presents a fairly even-handed view, or at least would be seen as such by the polarized factions eager to cram their politics down your throat, but I think ""Vera Drake"" does a good job keeping perspective.

Vera is a interesting figure, a dowdy, kindly, but almost nave about the gravity of what it is she's doing, namely, ""helping"" to induce miscarriages among the impoverished young girls, in her threadbare community.  She's definitely not the callous, rubber gloved, bloody smocked-wearing back-alley abortionist, who lights a cigarette and says ""next"" after doing his evil deed. Yet, in spite of her well-intentioned motivations, she takes no real responsibility for what happens to the girls she administers a unsanitary ""home-cooked"" douche to, and watching the understandably terrified girls receive this treatment is meant make us shift in our seats. However, Vera recives a rude awakening when (SPOILER ALERT) she eventually does time for her actions, and she meets those who have also performed similar abortions (but for profit) and appear to have no remorse for the girls they've injured or even killed. She also finds out her ""friend"" that set up her meetings, has been charging the girls, and pocketing the money.

Mike Lee sets Vera Drake in post-war England, in a time when a nave, young girls could still find themselves ""ruined for life"" in the eyes of the community and by their own families, for having babies out of wedlock. The gravity of their situation is illustrated by their very willingness to have these dangerous, painful, and illegal procedures performed on themselves.

The men of the time are clearly a mixed lot as well. Vera's own son is unable to forgive his mothers actions, but earlier is seen ""eyeing-up"" the young girls at a community dance as potential sexual conquests. This scene resonates later, because in spite of his moral indignation toward mom, he could easily be the father of one of the girls she treats.

Many of the reviews here, appear to me to have been written by people who haven't actually seen the film, and just want to spout off. My opinion is see it for yourself, judge for yourself, and allow others to do the same. It's a highly complex and thoughtful treatment of the issue at hand.",1113177600,10,2291,4.909560723514212

2219393,5,B0007LXJAK,"In this award winning 2004 film, Imelda Staunton is cast as Vera Drake, a British working class woman in 1950.  It's post-war in Britain and there's still rationing.  And the modest flat where Vera lives with her family is very spare.  However, this woman brings love there, you can tell that.  She's always doing some sort of service for somebody.  She visits invalids and tries to cheer them up, she smiles and gives a cheery greeting to all, and she polishes the brass in the home of the wealthy family she works for with pleasant energy.  She has two grown children and she plays matchmaker for her shy daughter.  Her husband adores her and they have a happy household.  She leads a good life, mostly by being useful.  And it's always appreciated.

However, one of the things she does to be useful is to help out girls in trouble.  A couple of times a week, she packs her syringe and soap and administers a douche to women who want to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy. This is illegal.  But, to Vera, she is just being her helpful self, especially since she never takes money for her services although unbeknownst to her, the woman who arranges these visits to all these women in trouble, is charging a fee and not letting Vera know.  It was inevitable; of course, that one of the girls she helps has a bad medical reaction and almost dies as a result.

Vera's arrest right in the middle of a family celebration of her daughter's engagement is full of emotion.  Even the police feel sorry for her.  We now see the effect of this on her family.  And we can't help but feel sorry for Vera.

This is a powerful film.  It tries to stay away from judging the acts Vera commits.  Instead it focuses on her as a person.  I understand the director had the actors do improvisations for weeks before filming.  I'm sure that's why every little detail rings true.  All of the performances were excellent.  The casting was perfect.  And the humanity of the situation was absolutely real. I felt privileged to view this very intimate portrait of a family. I was right there with all of them, especially Vera.  Of course the ending was sad.  It couldn't be any other way.

2219404,5,B0007LXJAK,"Imelda Staunton is Vera Drake to perfection.  Director/Writer Mike Leigh has crafted a wonderfully entertaining and moving film about subject matters that most people find depressing.  Who wants to see how older single poor people live out their dreary lives in tiny apartments in 1950's London?  Who wants to see the  snobbish rich look down on everyone around them?  Who would want to witness `old-time' abortion?  That is how well Director Leigh and Actress Staunton work this film.  The scenes can be dreary, especially with the lighting and attention to detail done perfectly.  Staunton as Vera is an astonishing character to watch.  She happily hums through any tedious chore, whether it is polishing a rich woman's fireplace ornamentation to delivering food to an elderly man who looks like he hasn't moved from his chair in weeks.  The scenes where Vera cheerfully helps out the young girls with a solution to induce a miscarriage is done like any other chore Vera has in her busy charitable life.  Her cheerfulness permeates the film.  It isn't until the police arrive and shatter the family's world with the revelation that Vera is the one who has been aborting many of the girls in London.  The backstabbing of Vera's stuffy ""accountant"" and the pompous vile of the rich mother whose daughter falls ill is shocking, but not unexpected.  Vera's family is a testament to true family values when trouble arises.  The only disappointment in this film is that Vera never truly realizes what she has done.  She is aware, and we sympathize, but she does not understand why it is considered wrong.  Her innocence is charming, but some self-realization could have gone a long way.",1112832000,10,1682,4.95
2219405,5,B0007LXJAK,"*MILD SPOLIER ALERT*

It seems to me to be a fairly reasonable request that one should actually see a movie before one begins to slam its Amazon page with one star reviews condemning it.  Such reviews exist here.  These reviews do not review the movie ""Vera Drake,"" they merely use this forum to press their own agenda.

For the record the movie ""Vera Drake"" is not a movie about abortion.  Abortion is certainly a key issue raised by the film but first and for most the movie is about a particular woman in a specific time and place and the choices she makes regarding women who are scared and lonely.  Choices, it implies, she makes due to her own abandoment.  You do not have to agree with the actions the character of Vera Drake takes (and for the record I don't) to appreciate the dilemmas these women find themselves in -- dilemmas forced upon them by the hypocrisy of a society, which still exist today, by the abandonment of the men who played a major role in their predicament and of the condemnation of those who critize them while doing nothing to help them make the morally right choice.  For that reason it is quite interesting that the movie ""Vera Drake"" has been praised by both ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life"" groups.  *ANYONE* who has seen the movie understands that the movie in no way, shape, or form, glorifies or glamorizes abortion and this is true for both the women in the movie who obtain them illegally via Vera, and for the woman who, because of her social status is, due to further societal hypocrisy is able to obtain one legally.

As for the much ballyhooed performance by Imelda Staunton in the title role, BELIEVE THE HYPE!  Although the movie is a tad slow going at first Staunton's performance is nothing short of magical as she transforms herself in a London cleaning lady in 1950.  The police interrogation scenes, in which the camera stays focused on Staunton's face are among the most gut wrenching ever put on film as, slowly but surely, it begins to sink in to Vera what the consequences of her actions are, not just for her, but for the women involved and their unwanted, unborn children.

See the movie first.  Then review.",1112832000,7,2161,4.59375
2219406,5,B0007LXJAK,"""Vera Drake"" is a great powerdrama released in 2004, starring Imelda Staunton.  This explores the heavily controversial subject abortion heavily.  Set in 1950 England, Vera Drake is a devoted wife and mother who cares for families as work.  Many consider her a warm, caring woman.  Therefore, everybody around her loves her.  She lives a secret life.  She terminates unwanted pregnancies without profit, which was illegal at the time (it wouldn't become legal until 1967).  Everything runs smoothly until a complication with one of her patients happens.  From there, she reveals deep secrets she's kept from everybody for twenty years.  Through everything, her relationships become tested.

Crafted beautifully by writer and director Mike Leigh, the emotional aspect remains present throughout the film.  From the patients' struggles to Vera Drake's battles, this film teaches audiences about abortion issues.  This film is neither about pro-choice or pro-life; this offers a variety of facts from both sides.  That's what makes this film more amazing.  Audiences can interpret this their own way.  The deep events and words within the film prove that this film is more than a woman who helps young women.  This explores her beginning and her beliefs in the system.  The multi-layering forces audiences to think deeply about the film.  Most must watch it multiple times to fully understand everything.

Though all the performances are wonderful, Imelda Staunton's unbelievable performance as Vera Drake is breathtaking, earning her many acting awards including an Oscar nomination (Best Actress).  She places heavy emotion through her character's personality and battles.  Through her cries and her charitable times, she maintains her personality posture throughout.  The details that are not revealed by words are wonderfully revealed by her expressions, namely her influence to begin her quest.  Though Best Actress Oscar winner Hilary Swank's role in ""Million Dollar Baby"" is more powerful, Staunton's quality closely matches hers.

""Vera Drake"" is a powerful film that is sure to please many audiences regardless of political views.  This is sure to be a great educator with abortion issues though the storyline is fiction.",1112832000,2,2227,5.46041055718475
2219407,5,B0007LXJAK,"Contrary to what at least one reviewer wrote, this isn't a film about morality. Although the character of Vera Drake is immensely likeable, the women she meets at the end of the movie most certainly are not. Neither is the woman who arranges Vera's abortions.

This is simply a film about a woman who tried to ""help girls out"", because, as we can surmise during her interview with the Inspector, something happened to her when she was young and poor, and she needed someone to help her out. The film did, indeed, demonstrate that if you have money you can have an abortion, so instead of morality, perhaps those that are offended by abortion (and seriously, does anyone *like* abortion?) should view this as a film about class structure. How the wealthy get what they need, and the poor have to scrounge about in the gutter.

Aside from Imelda Staunton's spectacular performance, the film impressed me with it's quiet elegance. It addressed a ""hot"" topic, and it could have delivered this to us with thunderheads. Instead, it addressed it with grace, and allowed us - liberal and conservative alike - to draw our own conclusions.",1112745600,2,1129,4.7846153846153845
2219408,5,B0007LXJAK,"The contest for this year's Best Actress Oscar was supposedly between Hilary Swank in ""Million Dollar Baby"" and Annette Bening in ""Being Julia,"" not just because the two won the Golden Globe Awards for their performances but also because a few years back Swank won for ""Boy's Don't Cry"" over Bening in ""American Beauty.""  But I think the two most captivating performances from the movies of the past year were Catalina Sandino Moreno's unforgettable debut in ""Maria Full of Grace"" and Imelda Staunton's total embodiment of the title character in ""Vera Drake.""

Vera Drake is a perpetually pleasant woman who apparently cannot stop herself from helping people or from calling them ""dear,"" even in circumstances where it is clearly not called for.  Vera works as a cleaning woman in the house of a rich family and then she comes home to care for not only her family but on invalids in the neighborhood.  When she offers to do something for somebody and says that it is not a bother, she really means it.  At one point she has to assure someone this is indeed the case, and you have to wonder how anybody in the neighborhood would not know that about Vera.  But then there are very few people in the neighborhood who knows that when a young girl gets in trouble, she can come to Vera Drake and have an abortion.

Writer-director Mike Leigh's film is set in London after the war, when things were still being rationed and the black market was still in effect.  Lily (Ruth Sheen), the woman from whom Vera gets black market sugar is the same person who will slip her the name of a woman who needs ""help.""  Vera does not know that Lily charges these women for this service, but then Vera helps out these young women because ""they got no one to turn to,"" and not for profit.  Vera would not charge them any more than she does for the other services that they do.  The young women who come to her represent the spectrum of reasons, from rape to convenience, but Vera offers neither judgment nor counseling.  She simply provides her help until she is caught.

Vera is surrounded by her entire family having dinner when the police come to her flat and the look on her face makes it clear that she knows her world is about to be destroyed, even if she does not understand the reasons or the process.  The close up of her face as Vera has this moment of realization is the most unforgettable image in the scene and Staunton's performance changes accordingly as her character is undone.  What follows is a most unusual interrogation session at the police station as the Detective Inspector (Peter Wight) who questions Vera comes to realize there is more to this case than meets the eyes.  But once Vera is brought before a court it is clear that the letter of the law makes no allowances someone like her.  Even when we meet others like Vera, it remains painfully obvious that she is unique.

In many ways ""Vera Drake"" is a fitting counterpart to the film version of ""The Cider House Rules,"" inasmuch as it provides more of a sense of the debate on the subject of abortion that was excised from John Irving's novel.  As I read it the point of ""The Cider House Rules"" was that saying you were opposed to abortion on moral grounds was immoral if you refused to do anything about the women who find themselves in this position and that society had to deal with the larger picture.  Abortion was a crime in England until 1967 (unless you had 100 pounds) and the other key moment of realization in ""Vera Drake"" is when the copper who is interviewing her comes to understand that the woman before him is not going to fit the idea he has in his head of an abortionist.  She is the absolute flip side of the horrific image of the back alley abortionist and it almost seems as if they simply reversed that stereotype to create the character of Vera.  In contrast to Vera is the doctor who is willing to perform the same illegal service for about fifty times the amount Lily charges.  Vera Drake is a criminal, but she is not a hypocrite.

Of course the shortcoming in the film is that is does not address what a society can do to eliminate or at least reduce abortions, a pragmatic question that is separate from the issue of making abortions illegal again.  The point of ""Vera Drake"" is that there was a time when people were not talking about this subject in England and the excuse that it was not fit for polite conversation is a poor excuse for ignoring the problem.  Those family and friends who abandon Vera do so more out of a sense of mortification of being associated with her in the eyes of the public than from feelings of moral outrage, albeit with one key exception.  Hating abortions but loving the abortionist is never an easy task and this is especially true when she turns out to be a member of your own family.",1112572800,3,4806,4.487944890929966
2219409,4,B0007LXJAK,"This movie dares to put a personal face on the people whose lives are affected by unexpected pregnancies, those unwed mothers who have no one else to turn to. Its focus, however, is on the woman who is dedicated to helping them - Vera Drake.

  As you might imagine, this is a tale that could be told with all sorts of over-the-top drama and manipulative tactics..and thank goodness, the director has the good sense to simply show Vera Drake (Imelda Stunton) as an average woman, going about your average life...which also happens to contain activities that others find distasteful but which she sees as acts of compassion. Someone has to help these women and, Vera being the person she is, simply can't turn them away. She also manages to look after her family while keeping her ""extra"" activities a secret.

  Imelda Staunton is such a wondeful actress that you can't help but be drawn to her and her warm, good heart. There are hints, however, that she may have deeper motivations for doing what she does, perhaps some secret in her own past. But these are only hints and they add a tantalizing ambiguity to the portrait of this remarkable woman.

  Although it is simply told, this movie is far more dramatic because of its understatements, the points where the director wisely pulls back from overdramatizing an inherently emotional subject. He also gives Staunton full rein and watching her face tells all...little embellishment is needed aside from her performance.

  No matter how you feel about what she does, you won't be able to resist the power and resonance of Vera Drake...or of this film.",1112572800,4,1604,4.813868613138686

2219411,5,B0007LXJAK,"Half-way into Mike Leigh's film about Vera Drake the Detective Inspector Webster (Peter Wight) makes the statement, ""I'm just trying to get to the bottom of things.""  However, the bottom of things has been presented in the hour before Detective Inspector Webster makes his statement, as the audience is visually presented with the socioeconomic and the patriarchal standards of the early 1950's British society in which Vera Drake (Imelda Staunton) exists.  It is obvious through Mike Leigh's visual presentation that women of the working class cannot afford proper medical treatment to terminate a pregnancy in a ""proper"" manner.  Thus, women of the working class that have been impregnated for whatever reason, but cannot bear the child due to poverty, social shame, or other reason are forced to seek help from women such as Vera Drake.

To be of service to others Vera Drake brings the joyous mood that seems to surround her wherever she wanders.  If she is not cooking and cleaning at her own home she seeks to help others.  She tends to handicapped and depressed neighbors, nurtures her aging mother, cleans in upper-class homes, invites lonely men to her family's dinner table, and she performs abortions free of charge to young women in need.  Many think of her as the perfect wife who does everything with pleasure while curing the tinier predicaments in other peoples lives by implementing her most famous words, ""I'll put a kettle on.""  In essence, Vera seems to be an earthly angel that was brought to earth to make life a little better for those in need while she calls all ""dear"".

Abortion is the controversial element of the story, as Vera innocently moves about to perform these terminations of the pregnancies.  Vera's method to perform the abortions is equally innocent, as she merely uses a syringe to fill the uterus with soapy water and a couple of days later the woman have a miscarriage.  Her clients always seem to be a little cautious after this short and painless procedure to which she calms them down by saying that after a day or two they will have some pain down below and after that everything will be ok, as she hurries to find someone else to help.  The abortions are only a small part of her life, yet she is strongly aware of society's notions and laws against it.

Next to the story of Vera there is a smaller side story about Susan (Sally Hawkins), an innocent young upper-class girl, that ends up in a terrible situation after a male has not acknowledged her crying refusal of his nearness.  Susan's problems stir up strong emotional dilemma, a reflection of how many women might be experience the difficulty of the situation in which they were positioned.  Yet, this story provides a mirror into the world where money is not the object that prevents proper care and treatment.  The only connection Susan has with Vera is that she is the family's maid who comes and cleans the house on a scheduled basis.

Despite the magnitude of abortion in the film the story is focused on Vera Drake and her persona.  Selflessly and emotionally torn, she cooperates with Detective Inspector Webster, as he is getting to the bottom of things by following the 100-year old law that Vera broke, which was generated in 1861 by a large group of men without consideration for the women in society.  In shame, Vera admits to her wrongdoings, yet she believes she was only of help to those who needed her help.  It is emotionally painful to see Vera's constant smile wither away when the police visit her home, as it is to see her weep to the charges brought to her.  It is no surprise to see that Imelda Staunton was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Actress category and that she has won several other awards for this performance.

Mike Leigh has directed several brilliant films such as Abigail's Party (1977), Naked (1993), Secrets & Lies (1996), and Topsy-Turvy (1999). Each time Leigh succeeds in bringing a new issue into light through a new perspective, and in Vera Drake he does it again.  This time he does it in a subtle manner that does not assault the mind like many other films do in the contemporary cinematic world.  Instead Leigh employs delicate finesse in his way of presenting the story, as he does not force any ideas or notions upon the audience.  This presents Leigh's awareness of the audience's own intelligence while he lets the audience make their own decisions in regards to their opinions.  Ultimately, Leigh provides a truly brilliant cinematic experience to the audience where the audience is left to their own device to form and contemplate upon their own notions in regards to Vera.",1112486400,5,4634,4.76846057571965
2219412,3,B0007LXJAK,"I don't get the hype. IT was a very ""O.K."" movie in my book. What can I say, I didn't come here to make friends; I came here to review the movie. So lets get to breaking it down (1) good acting (2) good story....and that's about all the goods I have on it. Which leads me to my next breakdown: (3) TERRIBLE SOUND. This is one of the worst sounds on a new DVD I have heard. I had to crank it up to hear it, and when I stopped the movie, and went back to watching regular tv, the regular cable tv was insanely loud. Try this out if you like. This means really bad production. (4) the accents - Add this on top of point 3 and you will have a hard time making out some of the sentences. It was decipherable, it just could have been better. (5) It's fake. It plays out like it really happened, but it didn't, so what's the point of this movie? There has been women in history that were guilty of this, why not make a movie on one of them?  If it was real, it would be a million times better(6) Vague ending. Your left to guess whether the character serves her full term in prison, if she gets out on good behavior, how her family reacts after she gets out of prison, the emotion of her fitting back into society. There is just way too much left out (7) The movie tended to get boring",1112486400,6,1278,3.972762645914397
2219413,4,B0007LXJAK,"Mike Leigh has no bigger fan than I. As mentioned elsewhere, he coaxes world-class performances from every actor, no matter how important, how visible, how many lines they have. Just watch Fenella Woolgar eat up the screen in the four or five minutes she gets. Or how Eddie Marsan as Reg, a rough working man of few words, manages to capture our attention and our pity with the word ""Smashing"" after a difficult Christmas dinner. And Peter Wight, wonderful in other Leigh films, is spot-on here. Soft yet firm, vulnerable yet confident, he is absolutely perfect.

A glorious feature unmentioned by other reviewers is the look of this film. This is a dirty, shabby world of deprivation, few choices, and squalor, a country suffering from post-war shortages and a clear lack of paint. Every scene feels as if we are intruding, thrust into a world far away and yet right here; we never feel as if we are merely watching. Leigh's films always look good; this is no exception.

And yet, I was disappointed by Vera Drake. Sure, Vera is a wonderful lady, touchingly drawn. Sure the morality is played as complex. But for some of us, it isn't as complex as that. I'm afraid I'm with Sid on this, who can forgive his mum without accepting or approving of the horror of her calling. It is not Sid, but Vera, who chooses to see the world in black and white. There can be nothing wrong with what she does; she is, and always has been, a helper. She even refuses to acknowledge that she performs abortions, ""That's your word for it."" No Vera, that is THE word for it. With the events in Florida, we see how people use words to justify and mean whatever they want them to. Kill to help. Girls in trouble....A few years ago a really bad movie called ""If These Walls Could Talk"" used that kind of manipulative bombastic overblown propaganda to create the kind of extreme circumstances abortion supporters love to believe are the norm rather than the exception. Mike Leigh is far above such tripe, but he skirts dangerously close to it. If we didn't have the tidy abortion of the upper class girl, whose mother refuses to even acknowledge Vera at the end of the film (""Oh the hypocrite, if she only knew!"") the tale might be more ambivalent. But though Vera is hardly the saintly character she likes to imagine herself, I think the message is leadenly clear.

And I too found Vera's breakdown at the end a tad tiresome. Yes, she sobs, or cries, or whimpers, or represses all of the above, but the film's action comes to an abrupt halt, as the conflict and implied meanings conclude. Too much close up, too slow, and I didn't really care. I wasn't convinced. Worth viewing, beautifully done, but not as compelling as its fans wish it was. They live in a world where they must have issues like this be complex; but if you think they're not, then the whole argument is rather lame. Lots of people do evil thinking they are doing good. Vera is one of them. And you negative voters, fire away. Though is it reasonable to say a review isn't helpful if you hate my politics rather than my writing?",1112227200,8,3073,4.543321299638989

2219426,4,B0007LXJAK,"Politics aside, I think it's completely off the mark to label Vera Drake a ""saintly abortionist"" film.  Nothing in the movie suggests a strong pro-choice leaning, which is the reason it works.  Vera is not glorified in any way for her acts: one procedure *SPOILER ALERT* almost kills a young girl.  Mike Leigh films the procedures themselves in a very scary way, weighing the balances of the whole right-to-life issue, certainly not in a manipulative way.  He shows how some women (the frightened girl) respond negatively to Vera's ""help"" while others (the disinterested rich girl) treat it like a trip to the dentist.  Ultimately, Vera is a good person who was led early on in her life to believe that what she is doing is morally correct.  The fact that she sees no consequences and only too late realizes there is a damaging side to what she does is the tragedy of the film.  I don't believe that Leigh is out to say her fate is tragic because abortion is right, but rather that a woman with a good heart who was (possibly?  you decide) led astray in her beliefs has been torn from her loving family.  I feel this is all very clear in the film.  As for Mr. Leigh's own thoughts on the issue, he refused to pick a side at a panel for the film he attended last year...hardly a raging pro-choicer.

Incidentially, comparing abortion to the holocaust is outright lunacy - but that's another topic.",1110758400,7,1396,4.566265060240964
2219427,5,B0007LXJAK,"Reviews of this movie which say that Vera is simply an angel of mercy and good as gold are misunderstanding the way Vera's story is told - watch it again and you'll see that little by little Vera's actions become less about ""helping girls out"" (which she does do, there's no arguing with that) and more about how little she is able to come to terms with some of the darker aspects of her work. She goes through her life whistling a happy tune, but she walks away from everything complicated - as the movie proceeds, we see little by little how she turns from the girls who obviously are having emotional trouble with what they're doing when getting their abortions. She doesn't stay to calm them or to work through the psychological pain they're going through, because that's not the way Vera's made.

Truth-telling isn't a tool in her toolbox. For Vera, the solution to all of life's problems, big or small, is to have a cup of tea. [In fact, the first time someone asked me if I wanted ""a cuppa"" after I saw this movie, I just blanched.] Vera is so tightly wound, and needs her world to be so simple, so good, that she's destroyed when her world comes to a screeching halt. So she's no ""angel of mercy"" -- and the people reviewing this film who think she is just too good to be true are missing the point. She is good, deeply good and caring, but she's also badly flawed, and those flaws are due to her own deprivations and her own struggle to survive. Mike Leigh doesn't want us leaving the theater thinking Vera was only a victim of a bad law. He wants us to understand that she, and many other poor people in England after the Depression and the Blitz, coped with their burdens in very different ways. Some people in Vera's world are bitter about the war, others put the war away and never think about it. Some long for material things, some don't.  Some people remain loving despite their problems. Some don't. Some people make money off girls who are in trouble. Some, like Vera, help girls out without compensation. Some rich girls in trouble lie to doctors and get legal abortions. Some laugh and act like they don't care about anything. Everyone copes differently with problems, and Vera's way of coping is going to catch up with her, you know it from the start and it's painful to watch.

Vera is wonderfully loving with her family, and she is well-intentioned. She performs the abortions out of concern for the young girls involved. But she is only forced to slow down and think (to stop whistling and stop offering people tea and biscuits and stop fussing and cooing)when her actions are brought home to her. She sometimes helps people, and she sometimes hurts people, but she never has slowed down to think about it.

Imelda Staunton's performance is absolutely brilliant (and don't believe the reviewer who says she cries and cries - that's just not true - her sorrow is very tightly controlled - to the point of an unnerving paralysis, in fact, where she can't even respond.) Her supporting crew is equally good. Pay close attention as the movie opens to the way these people talk about the war and the damage done to them in those years. Maybe we've forgotten how hard that was for people, what they were forced to do, how they coped. It's a real key to the film. We all applaud grit and gumption [think of Churchill turning Dunkirk, which was a slaughter, into ""Britain's finest hour""]and we know that Vera has enough gumption to keep her going forever, if nothing gets in the way. But do we applaud a life spent pretending that everything is rosy as can be?

Honor this movie by slowing down and thinking about what's both good and bad about Vera. She's learned to survive by limiting her vision to only the good, ignoring everything bad. Then, abruptly, she is reminded that not only is there ugliness and pain in the world, but she has caused some of it herself. This is a beautiful movie, but it takes some quiet reflection to get to the heart of it.",1109808000,12,3972,4.511111111111111

2219429,4,B0007LXJAK,"Two of my favorite Mike Leigh films are Topsy Turvy and Secrets And Lies. I especially loved the latter, because it was a great dramedy about the reunion of an interracial mother and daughter. Vera Drake deals with a provocative subject of illegal abortion taken place more than 50 years ago in London. It's somewhat slow and dull for the first half, but it really becomes intense and compelling the second half, and Imelda Staunton's heavy duty performance will captivate you and might jerk some tears out of you when she had to shed a bucket of tears.

Vera Drake is a decent, ordinary hard working house wife and cleaning lady with relentless amount of kindness in her heart that made her a care-taker to not only her ailing mother, family, and even girls who needed her help on a weekly basis. She's been secretly helping girls out for about 20 years and her family had no idea of this secret life of hers. The pregnant girls are arranged by Vera's long-time friend(Ms. Clark) at coffee shops to set up private appointments to meet Vera, and she charged them a good deal while Vera had never receive a dime for the services.

Vera had performed abortion so many times and never thought of any failure might come about, until one of the girls ended up in the hospital after getting her help. The hospital got the police involved to investigate the illegal abortion, and the sick girl and her mother were obligated to revealed the truth. On the night of a celebration of Vera's daughter's engagement, the police came knocking at the door, and that's when Vera's world turned upside down.

The supporting cast members are all very good, especially the actors who played the Vera's daughter, husband, Ms. Clark, and the girl that was raped and got pregnant. Jim Broadbent previously featured in Leigh's elaborate Topsy Turvy appeared in a cameo role as the judge at the end of the film.

As for Imelda Staunton, her role is quite complex, because she's very ordinary on the outside, but she's hiding another person inside. Her transformation into the role is very impressive, considered that she's in her late forties playing a woman in her sixties. She really got all the mannerism right and her crying scenes were mesmerizing. Basically, her role is the opposite of the glamorous and wicked Julia Lambert/Annette Bening who had a lot of fun in Being Julia. As far as the Oscar competition is concerned for the best actress cateogory, I think Annette Bening is first choice, Hilary Swank is second, Imelda Staunton is third, Catalina Sandeno Moreno is forth, and Kate Winslet is last. Staunton's role is not as multi-layered like Bening's, who had to show off all her range.",1109203200,3,2675,4.746236559139785
2219430,3,B0007LXJAK,"Imelda Staunton leads the tremendous cast of Mike Leigh's latest window into old Britain with wonderful subtlety. Her Vera Drake is instantly endearing: she nags without being a nag, cares for those around her without being a bother, bosses without being bossy, and gives the local troubled girls abortions while humming a tune. Unfortunately for Staunton and cast, Leigh splits the film into two distinct parts: before and after Vera gets busted. Before is wonderful. The people are brimming with life and stunningly realized. After is a long bore of streaming tears and garbled utterances. The plot never leads the way, and shouldn't in this kind of film, but the second half tries to rely on plot in such a way as to render it pointless. Viewers know what will happen, there are no surprises, and the performances stagnate. Additionally, a sidebar tale of a well-to-do girl that requires an abortion and has virtually no trouble getting one simply needed to be cut, as it serves no purpose but to show how differently the lives of the rich are when compared to the lives of the poor. But we knew that already. We don't need a little mini-tale to show us, and especially when it concerns this topic. Despite all its flaws, Vera Drake is worth seeing, as the dreary tear-soaked ending may not bother everyone. Had Leigh continued in the vein in which he began the film, it would have been a real marvel.",1109116800,5,1404,4.73469387755102
2219431,1,B0007LXJAK,"This is going to be me vs. the world and I am going to get a million ""Not helpful"" comments but I don't care. This movie is awful! OK here is what I think. But PLEASE READ THE WHOLE REVIEW IF YOU SAY THAT IT WASN'T HELPFUL TO YOU.

  It starts out in a house, with a light-hearted woman cooking. The first 15 minutes, I couldn't hear what they were saying because of their accents. I could make out the word ""tea"". They used that word a lot. I can't really comment on the first 15 minutes. Maybe I'm going deaf or something

  Then comes the abortions. There are around 4 abortion scenes. The pregnant women are crying and everything (so cliche). THis goes on for a while with more unhearable dialogue.

  Then Vera Drake almost kills one of her patients. The patient is forced to tell the police that the almost-fatal abortion was received from a woman by the name of Vera Drake, which is where the title came from. Naming the movie after the protagonist. How original! I've never seen that before...

  Obviously, Mike Leigh will pick the worst possible moment for the policemen to arrive and arrest Vera Drake that he possible can, because this movie uses every trick in the world to make you like it. The son just got married! Yay! Everybody acts SOOO happy. It is cliche in a box. There are even bright colors. Then the police come and inform Vera Drake that she has been performing abortions and that that is illigal.

  Then, she cries. About 60% of this movie is listening to Vera Drake crying. As if Vera Drake didn't know this was illigal. Vera Drake describes this as ""helping young girls out"". Throughout the rest of the movie, Vera Drake does not defend what she was doing. She uses four words to defend her 20-or-so years of abortion and almost killing someone. Why not help girls out by doing volunteer work or something? Why brake the law? Anyway, nowwhere in the rest of the movie does Vera defend herself. She just cries non-stop.

  Throughout the interrigation process, she never defends herself. When the policemen arrest her after dinner, she doesn't defend herself. In all the times that she is in court, she doesn't defend herself. She just ...cries.... Then she cries some more....

  As you might expect, this movie is a movie that seems like its all about the end. Guilty or innocent? Then comes the end. The judge informs her about what she has done. She says NOTHING to defend herself. She never tells you why it's ok to give abortions. You expect there to be a memorable speech at the end, like in, say, ""A Man For All Seasons."" In that, Thomas More gives the jury a wonderful speech in the end defending himself. He ends up guilty, but the speech forces you to be on More's side, and it is intelligent; in Vera Drake, her speech is crying. She says as much as a sleeping man says. Why did she do the abortions? She never told me that!

  And now the audience is weeping. I looked around the theater in boredom, and everybody was crying, but Vera Drake DID do the abortions. She can't not go to jail. It's not like she was wrongly accused. The policemen are supposed to be the bad ones, but they're right! She almost killed a woman! She performed illegal abortions for 20 years! That is against the law. Yes, she seems like a nice woman, but she's just as guilty as all the mean ones.

  In the end, nothing happens. She is in jail, and walks. Then you see the family eat dinner. You still never get to know her except by hearing her crying. THat is all she does to defend herself is cry. She is like a fire hydrant. There is even one camera shot zoomed in on her tearducts, showing her crying, as if that helps you get to know Vera Drake any better! This is the most uneventful and slow movie ever. The events are: Vera gives abortions. Vera almost kills someone. Vera gets tried. She is convicted. She goes to jail. Everybody is mad. THAT IS THE WHOLE MOVIE. 0 else happens. Absolutely nothing. The rest is just crying or drinking tea. The movie could have been done in about 30 minutes.

  However, I do admit that this movie served its purpose. It did get me in a depressed mood at the end, and the acting is great. Well, Imelda Staunton is great. The others are nothing special. I walked out of the theater in a sad mood, but I fell for it. I had to think about it before I realized how manipulative it is. All that crying and having the cops seem emotionless. Everything about it is a manipulation. You never get to know Vera Drake, she never defends herself for her actions, she DID do the abortions and almost kill someone, so having her not go to jail would be unfair to others who performed abortions. She was just lucky enough to get a good actress to play her, and she cries a lot. But it is well-made and well-acted.

  This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life besides ""Saw"". Go see Million Dollar Baby or Ray or one of those others out in theater. They are all better than Vera Drake. I can't believe I'm the only one who feels this way, but what do I know? I'd strongly prefer if you say whether or not my review was helpful.",1108944000,38,5079,4.363443145589798
2219432,4,B0007LXJAK,"For all of ""Vera Drake's"" admirable qualities--brisk pacing, great acting, intelligent writing--its most laudable quality is the way it broaches the difficult subject of abortion.  Writer/director Mike Leigh tells an important human story in ""Vera Drake""-the story of an initially happy middle--class British family in the 1950s--while using abortion as a means to explore larger themes of betrayal, disappointment, and perseverance.  This is not a movie that is politically safe because it's afraid of controversy; it's politically safe because doing so strengthens the emotional conflicts that Vera Drake and her family must confront.

Vera Drake's life seems simple at first.  She has two children; her son, nearly an adult, works as a successful haberdasher, and her daughter, also past adolescence, is experiencing her first amorous relationship.  Her husband of more than twenty years is a car mechanic.  She stays in touch with nearly everyone in her building complex, caring for sick neighbors and cleaning for others.  People respect her and enjoy her company.  But Vera Drake has a secret in her life that only one of her friends knows about:  she ""helps girls out"", illegally providing abortions for women who want them.

Her work with girls is painful to watch.  When she would arrive at a customer's house, she calmly put on the kettle and told the woman to undress, lie down and wait.  Vera works for several women throughout the film; some handle the situation better than others, quietly doing what Vera wants them to do.  Others are so overcome by guilt and terror that they tremble and scream and cry.  Although Vera never completely explains why she ""helps girls out"", it's apparent on her face and through her actions that she truly believes an abortion is something a woman deserves if she desires it, something that is necessary and important and justified.

On one hand, I felt that she was providing a service which a woman wanted, a service that could make one's life easier; on the other, her work is bloody, ruinous, loathsome and controversial, and I had difficulty agreeing or disagreeing with what she did.  When one of Vera Drake's customers becomes ill (a not too uncommon thing to happen, considering the rudimentary tools used for the abortions), Vera is discovered by the police, for reasons unknown to her family.  The tension of the movie lies in this slow revealing of truths.  Since Vera's children and husband did not know of her ""service""-a service which she had provided for twenty years-they are stunned by the revelation.

The entire film is understated, showing characters who disagree with Vera's choices, and characters-like Vera's husband-who find some kind of good in providing abortions.  Seeing from all sides how the Drake family must deal with their unexpected problem allows the viewer to form their own opinion about the issue.  It's possible that some people will be utterly repulsed by Vera's actions, happy that she was caught and punished.  Others, like myself, will see Vera Drake as a likable human being, a person who had strong, grounded beliefs about what was right and wrong.  Regardless of one's fundamental response to the film, be it anger, sadness or understanding, Mike Leigh's ability to evoke such a wide range of feelings is quite an achievement, and a testament to his talent as writer/director of a film about a complicated human experience.",1107561600,12,3416,5.082437275985663
2219433,5,B0007LXJAK,"""Vera Drake"" is an exquisitely well-crafted film.

Writer-director Mike Leigh immerses us in the lives of the Drakes in London in 1950. There is scarcely a wide shot in the entire movie, because Leigh wants to shutter us inside the cramped apartment houses where Vera lives and busily makes her daily rounds as a caregiver and helping friend. It's a drama that grows on you as we reach ever deeper into Vera's heart.

Leigh takes realism and authenticity to new heights. He and his production team have managed to make everything spot on: the performances, lighting, design, costumes, the sense of time and place.

And in this place the lives on screen are often sorrowful.

You'd never know it, though, by looking at Vera. She always seems to be smiling, even when she's working as a cleaning woman in a few rich houses, scrubbing, dusting, polishing.

Thanks to Vera, who cooks and cleans for her own family, too, the Drakes manage to make a go of it in post-war England.

Vera's husband, Stan, is a mechanic. Her son Sid is an apprentice tailor. Daughter Ethel works in a light-bulb factory. The Drakes are close and carry a rather rosy outlook on life.

Then there is Vera's other, secret job.

Most people call them abortions. Vera thinks of them as helping out young girls who have gotten into a bit of trouble.

She's gentle, careful and rather matter-of-fact as she ends women's pregnancies in their bedrooms.

Her recovery prescription is the same for every patient: a good, hot cup of tea.

As Vera, Imelda Staunton delivers a masterful performance, worthy of whatever awards she'll pick up in the coming weeks (she's nominated for a best-actress Oscar and other prizes).

Staunton nimbly crosses that bridge, from everyday drudge to a woman at the edge of her emotions slammed into the harsh mirror of self-realization. All of the actors hit high notes. Leigh made sure that no role, no matter how small, was a throwaway.

For comic relief, there is Ethel (Alex Kelly) and her dim-witted potential suitor, Reg (Eddie Marsan), a nerdy duo who could chair the doofus convention in any era.

""Vera Drake"" is more about love, family and forgiveness than illegal operations. But its subtext is the battlefield of pro-choice vs. pro-life, where the nerve centers of humanity collide.",1107475200,6,2288,4.848329048843188
2219440,5,B0007LXJAK,"In Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"", there was a certain woman called Charlotte Palmer, a woman who was intensely irritating yet hysterically funny. The actress who played her in such a superior way was Imelda Staunton, the sensational actress who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as the selfless cleaner who helps women when they need it.

Her supreme acting talent is shown by her limitless range of drama. She was happy, cheerful and optimistic yet her world crumbled before her eyes; you can see it in Staunton's eyes: she's scarred forever. Just watching her after the revelation, you see her heartbreak, her pain, her desperate hope that things will return to normal and the slow realisation that she can't escape her demons.

It is almost impossible to not talk about Staunton but what a bloody great supporting cast she had! From Phil Davis as her supportive and loving husband Stan, Daniel Mays as Sid, her fun-loving son, Alex Kelly as Ethel, her shy and obedient daughter to the fantastic Sally Hawkins as the mysterious Susan Wells. This isn't an exhaustive list but just a few of an undeniably stellar cast - you have to see it to see why there is all this praise.

The film is proper 1950s London in the language, the attitudes of the people, costume and atmosphere of the time. It isn't fake or glossy - just real and gritty: it is an excellent showing of the choices we make, their effect on the people we love whilst showing the limited choices people had in times past.

Last Thought: Will Staunton take the statue? She better!",1107043200,4,1554,4.765799256505576
2219441,5,B0007LXJAK,"Last year, I trumpeted the performance of Charlize Theron in MONSTER as the one unequivocally deserving of the Best Actress Oscar. I was gratified when the Academy agreed with me. This year, I'm prepared to state the same for Imelda Staunton in VERA DRAKE.

It's 1950 Great Britain. King George VI still rules, and the country remains bedeviled by austerity measures brought on by WWII. Vera lives with her husband Stan (Philip Davis), mousy daughter Ethel (Alex Kelly), and unprepossessing son Sid (Daniel Mays) in a crowded north London flat. Though Stan owns and operates an auto repair garage with his brother, the Davis lifestyle is decidedly blue collar. Vera works as a house cleaner for upper middle-class clients. In her spare time, she ministers to homebound invalids, including her mother. Vera is generous, unfailingly cheerful, and good-hearted to a fault. Unbeknownst to her family, she's also the friendly neighborhood abortionist, who, without remuneration, helps lower class girls that find themselves in a family way. Vera's tools of the trade are carbolic soap, warm water, a length of hose, and a syringe bulb, all of which she uses to induce miscarriage. After years of uncomplicated practice, one of her clients almost dies of a pelvic infection. The medical authorities call in the coppers; Vera is arrested and tried.

The creators of VERA DRAKE do a superlative job re-creating the grubby existence of the English working class during this period. Except for those scenes shot in the homes of the relatively affluent, the ambience is grotty, dark, cramped, cheap, and even squalid. It's against this backdrop that the contrast is drawn between the medically safe, albeit illegal, abortions circumspectly available to those that can afford it (at 150 pounds sterling) and those - Vera's clients - that can't. The film isn't either anti or pro abortion, but rather condemns the inequality of care dictated by one's financial resources, a situation that never changes worldwide.

Staunton's role doesn't call for the wild mood swings of Theron's in MONSTER, but the dramatic intensity of the former performance is no less remarkable, and is best seen when Vera is being interrogated by the stolid but otherwise sympathetic Detective Inspector Webster, admirably played by Peter Wight. Vera is like a dumb animal caught in a trap of its own making, and the viewer's heart will likely bleed for the woman regardless of his/her personal view of abortion.

The film is, secondarily, a story of family bonds as Vera's husband, daughter, son, and daughter's fiance Reg (Eddie Marsan) close ranks when Mum is fingered, despite their universal shock and horror at her underground activities. Amidst a plethora of fine supporting performances, Davis as the loyal Stan arguably deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination.

VERA DRAKE is unremittingly depressing, and there's no happy ending, but it's undoubtedly one of 2004's ten best pictures.",1104105600,5,2958,5.205882352941177
2219442,5,B0007LXJAK,"I am tempted to compare this movie to ""Monster,"" in which the principal actress is magnificent, but the whole film is only so-so. Every actor in ""Vera Drake,"" Staunton, the young man who plays her son, the young women who plays her daughter, the men who play her husband and his brother (who even LOOK alike, but are unrelated), the daughter's fiancee,  the huge policeman who questions her, all the young girls, the poor ones and the rich one,--everyone is completely convincing as the character they play. Nor does the director strike one false note, from the costuming, to the setting, to the accents, to the very words everyone speaks. It is a jewel of a film.

And if you see it twice, (cockney is difficult for Americans--especially older Americans!)you will find the probable answer to the questions the policeman asks her, to which she is unable to reply: ""How did you get into this?...Did it happen to you when you were a girl?""",1104019200,6,937,4.7073170731707314
2219443,5,B0007LXJAK,"This has got to be one of the best movies of the year. I loved everything about it, and it was full of emotion. It does touch a sensitive subject, abortion, and since it takes place in 1950's England, that was a pratice that was illegal. ""Vera Drake"" is about a women named Vera Drake, who ignored these laws, and helps young women lose their unwanted children. The movie really isn't about the story, but about the different kinds of emotion by all the different characters. Throughout the film, we know that Vera is going to be caught, but when? Who is going to play a part in it? Why do they do it? The first hour focuses on her giving out these abortions, but firstwe are introduced to the family. All of the different characters in a family get their own little backstory, and it shows the beauty of being pregnant, and the dirty, unwantness, of being pregnant. Vera Drake is one of the nicest, kindest women I have ever seen on a movie screen, and everybody in the movie is lucky to know her. The only thing that got annoying was her constant need to make tea. I don't know how many times I heard ""You need a nice cup of tea,"" or ""I'll go put the the kettle on."" I'm sure it makes alot of people at the time, and  this time, feel better, but there was no reason for the constant need to drink it. But, minor problem, nothing to cost it a star. Imelda Staunton, who plays Vera Drake, was breathtaking, and my list of 2004 Oscar nominees have just begun, and could end, with her.

Like I said, Vera Drake lives in 1950's England, and she is the kindest women in the town, always looking after the neighbors to make sure that they were well. She lives with her family. Her husband, Franks, runs a car business with his brother Stan. Stan is married to Joyce, and they are trying to have a baby. Her son, Sid, is a tailer, and her daughter is a hopeful to marry Reg, who is a neighbor that Vera sees often. Vera has a friend named Lily, who helps Vera arrange abortions, something that nobody in her family knows that she does. She has been doing it for a while, and she knows that she isn't supposed to be doing it, but she does it, because of her constant need to help people. She helps one women, but she has a bad reaction to it, and gets sick. She almost dies, and her mother contacts the police and tells on Vera. She is arrested during a party for her daughters engagement. The second half of the movie focuses on what she tells the police, her trial, and finally, how her family feels about everything, but she has the face the music, because she always knew what she did was illgal.

After Vera is caught by the police, her entire cheery mood changes. She knows what she has to do, and what she did lasted for so long. The movie isn't powered by how she feels after she is caught, but how everybody else feels. The son refuses to believe it for a while, the husband is extremly upset. There is a scene in the beginning where Vera, and her family members are eating breakfast, and everybody is happy, and talking loudly. Then, at the end, after Vera is arrested, all is silent at the table, and they are all reflected on what they lost. It's very depressing. The movie doesn't end on a happy note, but it can't. I also like how they showed the lighter side of having children. Stan and Joyce are trying to have a baby, and we are seeing what it's like to have the miracle of birth, and not only about the people that don't want these children. ""Vera Drake"" is an amazing movie, and it certainly should be at the Oscars this year, and it will be on my Best of 2004 list at the end of the year.

ENJOY!---Rated R for depiction of strong thematic material.",1101427200,3,3663,4.266187050359712
2219444,5,B0007LXJAK,"Let me state this categorically:  there is no finer performance by an actor this year than Imelda Staunton in Mike Leigh's VERA DRAKE.  In fact, if there is any justice in the world at all she should easily win the Oscar for Best Actress.  Unfortunately, there is not always justice in the world, especially when we come to Oscar time, and Hollywood often gives the award to a less deserving but locally more popular actress.  But if we are focusing merely on quality of performance, Imelda Staunton this year is in a class of her own.  In fact, this is not merely the finest performance this year, but one of the very best performances I have ever seen.  The last time I was this impressed by a performance by an actress was, perhaps not accidentally, Brenda Blethyn in Mike Leigh's SECRETS AND LIES, a performance that won for Ms. Blethyn every acting award for which she was eligible, except for the Oscar (Frances McDormand won for her excellent but less impressive effort in FARGO).

Let me go a step further:  I know of no director working today who consistently manages to coax amazing performances out of his cast.  Every single one of his films are littered with amazing demonstrations of acting excellence, and this one is as remarkable in that way as any of his prior films.  Except for Staunton, there is absolutely no point in singling out individuals:  every actor is perfect for their part.  Clearly one reason Leigh manages to get such great jobs out of his actors is the fact that he writes some remarkable screenplays.  Invariably, even in a somewhat splashy production like TOPSY-TURVY, Leigh constantly keeps the focus on the individuals.  Most directors attempt to do this, but almost all are too impatient to get on with the story to slow things down and give the actors room to project anything like real life emotions.  Leigh's patience with scenes is one of his greatest assets, and the sheer power of this film frequently comes from his being willing to allot a scene all the time it needs.  In scene after scene, I kept thinking while watching this how a lesser director would have squandered the opportunity by rushing on to the next scene.

Not only is the acting and direction in this film very close to perfect, the sets are among the most realistic one could hope to find.  The film is set entirely in 1950, and absolutely nothing betrays the illusion.

Of course, little of this would matter much if there were not a story worth telling, and this one is unique.  Vera Drake is a good, good-hearted woman, one who obviously radiates good will, kindness, and compassion for everyone with whom she comes in contact.  The first half of the film contains countless scenes in which Vera is the spiritual glue that holds her family together, a fact that makes the final shot in the film so forceful (I'll not give away the end by explaining further).  Hosts of people depend on Vera for the way she holds the social fabric of their lives together.  She seems to be without a bad bone in her body.  Above all, she is a helper.  She helps her family, her neighbors, her mother, and girls with special problems.  She is someone whom the police would call an ""abortionist"" (a term she adamantly rejects for the description ""I help girls who need help"").  Vera helps without pay poor, working class women in early first term pregnancies for whom for whatever reason bringing a child to term will be a great hardship.  She does this by the injection of a lye soap solution that she injects with a rubber syringe, causing the fetus to abort a day or two later.

The film makes a contrast between the many poor women Vera helps with another abortion that an upper class girl (her father works in the Ministry of Defense), who becomes pregnant when she is raped early in the film.  I think it is a credit to Leigh that he does not trivialize the class situation by making the upper class girl's pregnancy a lighthearted thing.  In fact, the sheer agony the girl feels is one of the heartbreaking things in the film, the mere confession to the psychiatrist (who is necessary to recommend a legal, hospital abortion on the grounds that having the child would be psychologically dangerous) that she had been raped was gut-wrenching.  The point is not that either rich or poor girls get pregnant for casual or serious reasons, but that Vera is the only recourse they have.  In a home where a woman has seven children that they can barely feed as it is (these were the days before effective birth control), Vera is a bit of a savior.

Eventually, one of Vera's procedures goes wrong, and the mother of the girl hesitantly confesses to the police that Vera is the person who performed the abortion.  They investigate, find out where she lives, and interrupt and engagement party to arrest Vera.  Again, the strength of Leigh as a writer and director can be seen in his refusal to dehumanize the police, making them cruel villains.  In fact, throughout the scenes with the police what is most impressive is how kind they are in performing their duty to the full extent.  It is obvious that while they are intent on arresting an abortionist, they obviously like Vera, can sense what a good person she is.

In the end, the film identifies no villains.  Vera is obviously not viewed as one.  There is a condemnation of social hypocrisy that provides a service to a rich girl but not a poor one who has just as little need to bring a child to term.  Perhaps a legal system that criminalizes attempts to give a woman some control over her biology.  Clearly those who possess a patriarchal worldview that would prevent all voluntary ending of pregnancies will identify Vera as a villain, but even they should be able to sense the deep dilemma she feels.  Those opposed to choice will sense as strongly as the police that Vera is not a monster, but one who truly is trying to help others.

Post-Oscar Addition:  Though Staunton's performance was light year's beyond Hillary Swank's solid but definitely less spectacular job in MILLION DOLLAR BABY, she failed to win the Oscar, as I feared.  She must take some consolation that in absolutely every article I read on ""Who Ought to Win"" as opposed to who probably was going to win, the critics universally agreed that Imelda Staunton's performance was clearly the finest performance of the year.  No doubt many felt that her mere nomination was sufficient reward--it was not, after all, by any means a box office success, and still has not been released in many parts of the United States--but I keep fantasizing about a time when quality is recognized as quality.  There is the added fact that many and perhaps even most Academy voters didn't even see VERA DRAKE.  When they finally do, I'm sure there will be some embarrassment that they voted for Hillary Swank's very good but not truly great performance instead of this absolutely heart stopping one.",1100995200,139,6904,4.660611065235343
2219445,5,B0007LXJAK,"Imelda Staunton gives an amazing performance as the title character in Mike Leigh's new film, ""Vera Drake."" I've not seen a character as lovable, pure and caring as she is presented onscreen in many years. She's a good wife, a good mother, a good daughter and a hard worker, and many people - her family and beyond - depend upon her kindness and generosity to get by. Vera's always there with a good word, a hot cup of tea and a smile for whomever needs it.

That Vera Drake is an abortionist, inducing miscarriages among poor women who've found themselves in trouble, is only mildly shocking. The character presented is so helpful, so simple and so jolly that her illegal activities don't define who she is. Her charity, for she takes no money from her service (which involves a tube, hot water and grated lye soap), is just another way she helps others.

The film ""Vera Drake"" shows us all the aspects of her life, not just the darkest and most secretive one. It shows her as a loving and doting mother-of-two, a matchmaker - and it shows her enjoying her family's small victories in spite of poverty.

The audience gets to see Vera, her community and her family. We get an idea of what life was like for poor, blue-collar service workers in 1950 London.

Also, in contrast, we are shown how a rich girl, who lives in one of the houses Vera cleans, gets a legal abortion after being attacked because she's able to afford the procedure and go through the right channels.

The film ventures along without exhibiting consequences for Vera's actions for the longest time, so it never becomes a ""message"" movie about abortion. When the lectures do come from the characters over that issue, there's very little grandstanding. Instead, the film is character-driven, and it deals with how these specific characters cope with this situation in their home. The film rarely examines how the climate of the times affects the Drake family.

""Vera Drake"" is a very good movie featuring a great character and a thoroughly great performance. I recommend it.",1099267200,4,2043,4.724719101123595
2219446,5,B0007LXJAK,"Mike Leigh's 'Vera Drake' isn't so much a film about abortion as it is about family life and social inequality.  I suppose the actual abortion aspect of the film is a facet of both subjects.  The decision to avoid didacticism was a wise one on Leigh's part.  'Drake' is more open as a result, allowing its audience to look at abortion's place in all parts of society, past and present, and decide for themselves whether or not it is right or wrong.  After all, isn't a film more effective when it sparks discussion and elicits reaction instead of forcing opinion upon its viewers?

'Vera Drake's centerpiece is its title character, played by Imelda Staunton.  Drake is a kind woman in all walks of life.  She provides service to the disabled, to a sickly mother, and reminds her family of life's beauty.  She lives among the lower middle class of post-World War II England, but her family's need to have multiple jobs for financial security does not hinder their happiness.  As mentioned, it is Vera who maintains a sense of peace, of contentment, in not only her family's life but also the lives of those she helps as she hums along, making tea and scrubbing fire places.

As Leigh allows Drake's life to unfold before us, we see her working multiple jobs.  Her last service to the community is not one her friends and family are aware of.  We see her walk down a flight of stairs, smile as she wobbles down an ominously shadowed corridor, and arrive at the door of a young woman with fear in her eyes.  ""First thing's first.  We must put the kettle on,"" she says.  At first, it seems she's just helping out another neighbor, as Leigh does not provide us with what could have been detrimental fanfare indicating this girl's more secretive needs.  Instead, Drake's last of a long list of services is revealed with mild surprise as she removes a cheese grater, a bowl, a tube, a block of soap, and a bottle of disinfectant from her rather large bag, decorated with needle-point.  It is then we know what she is there to do, and we watch it happen, shocked that such a kindly old woman would do something considered illegal during her time.

We come to know Drake does not see abortion as illegal; it is here the actual issue is brought up.  To her, she is ""helping young girls out,"" a euphemism she chooses to utilize even though Staunton makes it clear through astounding internal work that Drake knows what she is doing is a potential danger to the girls she helps and to herself.  Leigh skillfully embeds this issue of abortion into societal matters.  In the '50s-era in which Leigh's film takes place, clinical abortions were legally given to women who could pay one hundred pounds, while those who could not had no alternatives for unwanted pregnancy.  Women like Vera Drake illegally provided abortions to the poor, and Leigh's film wonders whether or not laws against abortion in modern day will revert our society back to a time when lives are threatened simply because money is limited for one group and abundant for another.  Leigh presents us with the facts, and leaves us to deduce abortion's place in society.

When Drake is inevitably arrested, the film focuses on Staunton's face and it is then the film settles into a valley of despair that is as depressing as it is three-dimensional.  During an extended close-up, Staunton creates one of the best, most effective cinematic moments of the year as her facial muscles sink, her smile turning into a stunned frown, her eyes knowing that her family will begin to reluctantly explore the recesses of her life she'd kept hidden for their sake.

As Drake is brought to a police car waiting for her in front of the steps to her apartment, both the film and Staunton's performance begin to progress to yet another level the first two thirds of the film have made supremely effective as a result of skilled craftsmanship.  Imelda Staunton created a warmth in Vera that seems painfully distant when she begins to crumble as she breaks down into tears brought about while pondering how her actions will affect her son, her daughter, and her husband.  Throughout the beginning of 'Vera Drake,' Staunton invites us to become a part of her family, just as she welcomes a lonely man into her home only to find the love of Drake's daughter, to whom he would eventually marry.  As Drake is taken to court, faces the reaction of her family members, and suffers her own internal pains, we're right there beside her husband in his cramped living room, just as shaken as he, juxtaposing two different people who are one, but don't seem it.  Leigh's accomplishments combine perfectly with Staunton's own, resulting in a film resonant, important, and crucial in a time when these issues need to be given voice.",1099094400,6,4752,4.690361445783132
2219447,3,B0007LXJAK,"Nobody captures working class England and its socially reticent inhabitants better than director/screenwriter Mike Leigh does.  He brings a deeply felt authenticity to post-WWII London in the set-up of his rather controversial story, and one needs to give credit to Leigh for not turning the film into a polemic about abortion. At the same time though, the movie clocks in at over two hours, and its unrelenting bleakness has a wearing effect especially since Leigh takes a decidedly episodic approach to his story. The title character is a simple, frumpy woman, so kind-hearted that she thinks nothing of tending to those she sees as less fortunate, whether they be her mother, her invalid neighbor or the parade of mainly young girls who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies. Vera sees no distinction when it comes to helping these people selflessly, and to her immediate family, especially her loving husband, she is nothing less than a saint beyond reproach. Leigh takes his time in establishing this fact, too much time really, and pacing is part of the movie's problem. It appears that he is intent on showing how matter-of-fact her illegal abortion practice is compared to her everyday activities with her family. To some degree, the juxtaposition of scenes maximizes the later drama of consequences and ramifications, but the results are uneven because there is nothing remotely surprising about what happens to her.

The second half of the movie does develop a compelling emotionalism thanks to a stunning turn by Imelda Staunton. Until the moment she is arrested, Vera seems almost like a British version of Betty White's character on ""The Golden Girls"", all apple-cheeked optimism offering a cup of tea to soothe everyone's worries. However, when Vera realizes what is happening to her, Staunton effectively uses an expression of glazed shock followed by an implosion of endless crying jags to illuminate the inner turmoil of her character. For the most part, it's an economical performance, and yet thanks to Staunton, one never questions the sheer anguish her character is experiencing. The other actors are quite good, in particular, Phil Davis as her unsuspecting mechanic husband Stan; Daniel Mays as her enterprising son Sid, a men's store salesman; Peter Wight as the guardedly sympathetic inspector; and as two unlikely lovebirds, Alex Kelly as her hopelessly lumpish daughter Ethel and Eddie Marsan as the schlubby bachelor upstairs. In fact, his proposal scene to Ethel is a charming moment in their fumbling realization of their need for each other. Another keenly observed scene is one in which Sid deftly massages a middle-class customer's heartfelt desire to look like a swell at an important function. These are the moments in the movie that feel the  most truthful, and Leigh excels at directing such scenes without pretension.

The aim of the film is sound. Leigh wants to exalt the heroism of abortion providers during an era of extreme repression, and he makes sure to be true to the psychology of the working class at that time. Consequently it is compelling how he keeps Vera inarticulate during the most dramatic moments, even when she's being interrogated and realizes a prison sentence is at hand. What I didn't appreciate as much is how Leigh uses certain characters simply to move the plot along only to drop them later, for instance, the character of Susan and her plight are introduced simply as a counterpoint to Vera's method, showing how the rich took care of their abortions. There is the revelation that Vera's friend selfishly pocketed money from the pregnant girls all those years, and we are robbed of a confrontation scene that should have occurred between her and Vera about it. One could watch the movie to savor the acting, but truth be told, the film is probably about half an hour too long, as one scene after another signals the end of this desultory story. Despite Staunton's stellar performance, I have to admit I felt relieved when it was all over.",1098662400,10,4010,5.043740573152338
2219448,5,B0007LXJAK,"As you watch Vera Drake (Imelda Staunton) go about her daily life, bringing cheer and kindness everywhere she goes, you wouldn't think that she also is ""someone who helps young girls in trouble."" But director Mike Leigh has incorporated these procedures into Vera's life so naturally that they seem like just a small part of the overall good she does in her life: ""I help young girls who have no where else to go,"" she says.
Vera is a sturdy woman with a big heart and a strong back: she's a housekeeper for a rich local family, she corals lonely newcomers into her house for tea and she looks after her husband and family with as much dedication and love that she can muster. But she also is inordinately concerned about the unwed mothers who flock to her for a solution to their problem. And when one almost dies, Vera's life is torn apart. The look on Staunton's face and the deep, deep hurt and concern in her eyes as the police take her to jail is heartbreaking. And, more to Vera's credit, the concern she feels in her bones is not for herself, it is for her family and particularly her beloved husband: none of whom know anything about Vera's second profession even though it has been going on for close to twenty years. In any event, you will not soon forget this very truthful and emotional scene.
We are in Mike Leigh Country (Secrets and Lies) here: the land of middle class English families just after WWII. But ""Vera Drake"" is different than Leigh's other films in that there are no fingers pointed, no judgments made by the filmmaker. In fact Leigh seems to anoint Vera as an Angel of Mercy, which in these times in 2004 in which doctors who perform abortions are looked at as murderers and sometimes even killed, this film may be a way to get some balance back on this controversial subject.
Staunton is breathtaking as Vera: a round fussy, caring concerned ball of energy. But why is Vera so concerned with these young girls and their problem? Could she have had this same problem herself when she was young? And has she taken on this mantle as a way of rectifying something in her past? We don't know for sure and this ambiguity adds an edge to Staunton's performance that only helps to make ""Vera Drake"" an unusually potent and compelling piece of filmmaking.",1098662400,48,2277,4.529126213592233
2219449,5,B0007LXJAK,"Few filmmakers today have the particular sensitivity to wipe the sooty film off the windows into the flats of the British working class as Mike Leigh ('Secrets & Lies', 'Life is Sweet', 'Topsy Turvy', etc). Though designated as screenwriter for his works, Leigh actually selects a cast of characters and works with them in prolonged sessions prior to filming to get to the real way people speak and react to the driving subject of his films.  Though I personally consider 'Topsy Turvy' (the radiantly perfect depiction of the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan) to be his best film to date, VERA DRAKE now moves into that slot as his masterwork.

Simply stated, Vera Drake is a frumpy, sweet women who works days as a housekeeper for various wealthy people, returning to her small flat in the evenings with song on her lips, solving all the discontent of the world by offering a cup of tea. Her family adores her - her husband, her son, her homely and shy daughter, her helpless aging mother, and her extended family.  She does her best to make her corner of the world nice.  As a side occupation, Vera 'helps young girls out' - by lovingly and without remuneration inducing abortions, quietly, with a syringe and soap, and tender support.  She obtains her list of needy girls from a friend who, unknown to Vera, charges the pregnant girls and pockets the money.

Vera's life comes crashing down when one of her girls becomes septic and requires hospitalization and the doctors inform the police and Vera is arrested in front of her little family.  She is tried, admits her guilt and takes her sentence of imprisonment as justified for her life of selflessly helping needy girls in trouble. She admits that the letter of the law against abortions is right, but is personally of the commitment that she has only been helping those who can't find help like the rich folk can.  And life goes on.

The beauty of the storytelling is in the very delicate performances by Imelda Staunton (well known through her countless roles in the Shakespeare series with Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson and company, 'Peter's Friends', etc) and a supporting cast that includes an elegant cameo by Jim Broadbent as the judge presiding over her trial.  Each member of Vera's family is well acted, and, in great opposition to most stories of this kind, the arresting police and the subsequent representatives of the law in England are not painted as 'bad guys' but as simple people doing their job (Helen Coker as WPC Best is particularly sensitive to Vera's feelings during the duress of arrest).

The cinematography is cold and dark and captures the bleak midwinter of England seen in the poor sections of London to perfection.  Mike Leigh has this story down pat and delivers it with a powerful understatement that makes everyone involved (especially Imelda Staunton) shine.",1098489600,3,2852,4.833675564681725

The main reason I said I liked the film was the amazing acting of the people in the film. It was so well done that you found yourself caring for them, even though you didn't care for the movie or the subject of the movie.  But the story was lacking.

Vera is a very kind lady. She is kind to everyone, for no other reason than she is a good person. It is set in the recent past....or for the younger generation in their grandparent's past, when abortion was not legal.  She goes around giving abortions to women who do not want to be pregnant.
She does it for no pay, just to help. The movie shows others are less noble.

The story falls short for several reasons.

 You have this NICE woman, who goes about doing the abortions and we see no angst in her that she is doing this. Even nice people are usually deeply torn by this.  This NICE woman doesn't seem stupid. She sees the little needs in others and acts to solve or improve them...but she does not seem to catch on that the lady that connects her to the people needing abortions is a sleeze, and is taking money from them.

Then you wonder why in the world would a nice person do this. Nothing is provided until she is arrested, when one of her abortions goes wrong and the woman is hurt. Then it seems she had been in that situation herself. But not enough support to the why of her emotions to support the abortions is given. And at that point, the film that was building starts to get cracks in it even more, in that Mrs. Drake just crys and crys and crys and acts dumb and monotonous. Which is probably pretty true to what a normal person would do, but at that point the story needed some fleshing out.

Also, there is a lot to say about the time when abortions were illegal. I remember when girls were getting these abortions and they were being damaged and killed. It was more common than most people knew. I think birth control was not as common back then. But with one out of every three girls being molested then and now; I would say that pregnancy from assault is as prevalent now as it was then.  But the film doesn't go into much about the time, almost noting in fact.  The film is MORE about a look at a family that loves each other and gets hit with something that shakes, but does not break them. It is about their emotions more than it is about abortion.

Still, I think it is worth seeing because like Mrs. Miniver says, we owe it to the people that have suffered to not turn away. The film is like the dark of a closet to a child trying to sleep at night...frightening, but not clear as to what there is to be terrified by.",1522368000,,2666,4.173489278752436

8048596,5,B0007LXJAK,"A gripping drama on a woman that lived in a time where a young woman becoming pregnant was a reason to judge her in the cast system in England. There was always one woman in each town that could cause a spontaneous abortion, but Vera Drake was a dichotomy of sorts in that she was a loving mother surely making this a sleeper of a movie. A perplexing movie filled with mostly love and occasionally barbaric depending what side of the fence you stand on abortion.",1505606400,,462,4.383720930232558
8048597,4,B0007LXJAK,"I liked this movie alot. It didn't sugarcoat the tragedy of abortion like some political groups these days (liberals, planned parenthood, N.O.W) nor the pain felt by those who get one. And while the woman wasn't exactly the Kermit Gosnell of her day, it was good that she was finally stopped from this insane and dangerous procedure on women.  Women are far better off taking their chances and having the baby then to go to a back alley abortionist.",1493251200,,449,4.6835443037974684
