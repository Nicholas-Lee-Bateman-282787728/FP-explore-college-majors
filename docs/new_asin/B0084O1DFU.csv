8525197,5,B0084O1DFU,I think Urusei Yatsura is one of the best series ever. I have the complete set minus the elusive 2nd movie. The series should not have gone out of print. It is a classic.,1401580800,,170,4.029411764705882
8525198,5,B0084O1DFU,"Urusei Yatsura, the greatest and most hilarious anime series of all time from Japan, is now out of print by Anime-igo based in North Carolina. Terrible shame too, this is the single greatest series I have ever watched aside from Kimagure Orange Road, which also was released by Anime-igo years ago and is LONG Out of print. Great story lines, text translated conversations, character personalities, music and of course drawing make this an unstoppable watch! While this needs no introduction, here is a very brief overview: Lum (aka Lamu) The Invader, has to put up with the most unlucky person in the Universe named Ataru Moroboshi. While sporting a bikini with matching boots (Oni custom dress), shocking him with lightning and constantly worrying that he is always trying to cheat on her (which almost every episode/movie/OVA serves that true), she truly does love him and he refuses to admit he loves her. Ataru's parents, friends, enemies and heck, everyone except Lum, wants to get rid of him and his horrible ways. There are too many characters to count, but my personal favorites are Lum, Mendu, Shinobu, Miss Sakura, Cherry, Ryuu, Ryuu's dad, Kotatsu-neko, The Spice Girls (NOT THE 90's GIRL BAND!!!), Ton and the INSANE Ran-chan. A wide known legend in Japan, Urusei Yatsura manga and anime is the greatest of the great anime series. So sit back, relax and get ready to laugh with Those Obnoxoius Aliens!",1341532800,3,1414,4.945378151260504
