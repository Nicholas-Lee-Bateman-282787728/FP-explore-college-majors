8105934,3,B000E5KQJQ,"This is an old film my husband Pat Blymyer worked on in the early seventies. I was so happy to find it here and be able to buy it as I have never seen it before.  In a way it is old fashioned but okay. I loved seeing Pat in the back seat of the car. But along with Pat were many actors who went on to fame, like Gary Bussey and Keith Carradine.  It was fun to see So. Dakota and remember the Indian Reservation where we stayed all together as family during the filming.  I am not sure if anyone who was not associated would want to see this, but who knows. It was fun.",1426982400,,568,3.8376068376068377
8105935,1,B000E5KQJQ,"THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. THE SCRIPT WAS BAD, AS WAS THE ACTING. THE ""ACTION"" NOT THERE. I DID A LOT OF FAST FORWARD.",1394496000,,127,3.923076923076923
8105936,2,B000E5KQJQ,"This oddball film from the early 70's has Keith Carradine, Gary Busey & Scott Glenn as 3 post-WW1 biker-types that run afoul of townies in a small burg in Nebraska and end up hiding out on the farm of two odd sisters, both of whom seem rather witchy.  Their father was Indian, apparently, and taught them lots of things, like how to gather and smoke loco-weed, which their new friends rather like, actually.  This has some odd and spooky elements to it which are unfortunately overshadowed by an innate goofiness that keeps creeping into the film at all the wrong times, and that includes the kazoo/vaudeville/jaw harp music that will leave you wanting to rip your hair out.  In short, I don't think this film knows exactly what it wanted to be, therefore I really wasn't sure what to make of it.  2 out of 10, had potential but squandered it.",1183680000,2,843,4.562913907284768
