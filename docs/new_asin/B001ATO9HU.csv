THE REAL DEAL

This was the first time that Pride Fighting Championship came to the US in Las Vegas, and what a great event this was. This is still one of my favorites and featured great fight after great fight.

1. ROBBIE LAWLER VS JOEY VILLASENOR-the first fight is outstandingly quick with Robbie showing why he is Ruthless and crushes his opponent in seconds of the first. This was a quick entertaining one that the casual fan would love. 5/5

2. TRAVIS GALBRAITH VS KAZUHIRO NAKAMURA-excellent first round as both fighters come out to finish the other both do a good amount of damage to the other. Then in the second round Nakamura takes the victory with some vicious strikes on the ground. This is an excellent fight for both fighters in my opinion. 5/5

3. PHIL BARONI VS YOSUKE NISHIJIMA-another excellent and entertaining fight as Baroni takes Yosuke to the ground imminently and works for a nice kimura. Another great fight on an outstanding card. 5/5

4. DAN HENDERSON VS VITOR BELFORT-this just may be my favorite fight of the night contrary to what other people say this is a great fight that goes the distance. The first round is great with Dan getting the take down. In the second Henderson gets on top once again but still the action is good. The third round is just as great with Hendo getting the take down again but Vitor makes his way to the top towards the end of the fight. But Hendo makes his way back to the top and continue to a win. This is one of the best fights of the night in my opinion. 5/5

5. SEAN O' HAIRE VS BUTTERBEAN-yes you read that right that is Butterbean from the tough man competitions and from Jackass and all that. And Sean O' Haire from WCW and the WWE. This is a very quick fight as Butterbean lays Sean flat with some very strong shots. The fight lasts a very entertaining 20 something seconds of the first round. 5/5

6. JOSH BARNETT VS PAWEL NASTULA-the fight starts out with a good first round that sees Pawel come out on top as he controls most of the round. The second round is crazy as they stay standing and trade punch after punch. But Josh pulls out the submission victory and takes the win. 5/5

7. MAURICIO RUA VS KEVIN RANDLEMAN-this is the fight that displays one of the sickest submissions I have ever seen in my life. Kevin rushes Shogun and gets locked in an ankle lock that almost finishes him for the longest time, then when they roll Shogun locks in one of the nastiest knee bars I have ever seen. Shogun taps out Randleman in spectacular fashion. 5/5

8. MARK COLEMAN VS FEDOR EMELIANENKO-Coleman tries for the entire first round to take Fedor down with out success. Fedor dominates the round and lumps up and cuts Coleman. In the second round he finally gets that take down only to get put in an arm bar. Fedor dominated this fight and takes home another win. 5/5

this is one of my favorite events and I am glad it was released on DVD although Zuffa didn't release it correctly. Where are the real special features? Still this is an excellent event all should own.",1250467200,3,3043,4.437275985663082
8279671,4,B001ATO9HU,"Just purchased Pride 32 a few days ago and to my surprise it was better than I thought.  The majority of the matches were entertaining(except for Hendo/Belfort). Probably the most entertaining fight was Nakamura vs Travis Gailbraith. There wasn't much technical fighting in this match just a slug it out brawl. The O'haire vs Butterbean match was orginally slated to be Mark Hunt vs Butterbean, but for whatever reason Hunt couldn't compete and O'harie took his place.

Some of the reviewers pointed out that this DVD lacked any special features which is true, but what it does have that most pride DVD's don't have are interviews with the winners after their fights.  There is also a surprise ring appearance by one of Pride's top fighters. In all I thought this was a pretty good DVD.",1221091200,,786,4.807407407407408
8279672,4,B001ATO9HU,"Pride 32 was the first Pride event held on US soil in Las Vegas and features stars Robbie Lawler, Fedor Emelianenko, Dan Henderson, and Shogun Rua + lots more. A total of 8 fights. Every fight except one ends in a knockout or submission and some of the knockouts were very impressive including one of the best flying knees I've ever seen. Main event features Mark Coleman vs Fedor Emelianenko in a rematch. Coleman gets his face busted up bad! Only thing I didn't like was lack of special features. All you get is a fighter intro video and a photo gallery, whoopdy do, right?

Fight Card:

Joey Villasenor vs. Robbie Lawler-10/10(Doesnt last long, awesome finish to this one)
Kazuhiro Nakamura vs. Travis Galbraith-10/10(Very entertaining and ends in knockout)
Phil Baroni vs. Yosuke Nishijima-7/10
Dan Henderson vs. Vitor Belfort-5/10(Only dud of the event, goes to decision)
Eric Esch vs. Sean O'Haire-7/10
Josh Barnett vs. Pawel Nastula-8/10
Mauricio Rua vs. Kevin Randleman-8/10
Fedor Emelianenko vs. Mark Coleman-9/10",1221091200,6,1022,5.150602409638554
