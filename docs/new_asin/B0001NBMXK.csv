8015055,4,B0001NBMXK,"In my callow youth, I wanted to live in a great stone castle with loads of secret passages, like the Garr Castle in this serial.  There are secret panels, stone walls that move aside at the touch of a hidden button.  And perhaps best of all, there is a basement garage that one reaches, still seated in the car, by way of an elevator.  There's just one problem that hadn't occurred to me when I wanted such a mysterious abode:  if I could wander and hide in the secret passages, so could others--in this case The Green Archer.  Rather, two Green Archers, a good one and a bad one.

There is the usual fistfight in every episode, a staple of all serials.  In fact, there are some real donnybrooks, with Victor Jory frequently taking on six or seven thugs--and whooping them big time without mussing his hair, his clothes, or the skin on his knuckles.  The lead villain has an apparent endless supply of lackies or minions who are completely cowed, for reasons I don't understand.  They are insulted, beaten, humiliated, and they keep coming back for more.

The plot is simple and silly.  A burglary/robbery ring operates out of Garr Castle, and Victor Jory is out to stop them, helped on occasion by the good and mysterious Green Archer, who shoots arrows with amazing accuracy.  The bad Archer seems to hit a chair every time he shoots an arrow.  It gets a bit tedious after a while, as most serials do, unless you watch the episodes a week apart.

I do wish I could find a suit like the one Victory Jory wears.  He gets in many fights, gets completely drenched, wrecks cars, tumbles down embankments, jumps out windows and the suit doesn't get torn or dirty or wrinkled.  A suit like that is worth having.

Unlike most serials, this one has a rather film noir quality, lots of wonderful 1930s cars, city streets, night action, tough talk.  All in all, I liked it a great deal and would recommend it to anyone thinking about watching a serial.",1188518400,2,1943,4.518624641833811
