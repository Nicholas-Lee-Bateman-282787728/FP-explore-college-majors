2884067,1,B000SAAPFW,A crappy two hours of horrible drunk disfunctional parents. Made me grind my teeth. Nothing about the two men and romance. And a useless brother character who was completely wasted. Pass on this one. Horrible!,1220054400,3,209,5.0
2884068,5,B000SAAPFW,"This film is in French and has english subtitles so beware....

I loved this film as it ties the families story together quite well.  You don't get much background just a good starting point for the begining of the main action.

Each member of the family has a brief plot point in the film, each deals with personal as well as family issues.

Unlike alot of movies that try this type of mulitple plot story line ""Times have been Better"" ties the story together well and leaves you at a conclusion that is well rounded and leaves a mystery.(just a little)",1205539200,,554,4.455445544554456

2884070,5,B000SAAPFW,"THE best coming out to the parents movie ever! Unfortunately the Europeans just have the upper hand over their counterparts across the Atlantic when it comes to serious film making. You couldn't possibly touch more nerves, more accurately and more convincingly than this film does. You'll definitely laugh and will probably shed a tear too. It's a film that encourages you to love and to be stoic in the face of the consequences. And it proposes that there can be some sort of golden middle path in the catastrophe that is family life. Absolutely breathtaking!",1202774400,4,560,4.905263157894737
2884071,4,B000SAAPFW,"I agree with the other reviewer who said this movie transcended the gay coming out theme of queer cinema. It's as much if not more a journey of the parents than of the child. The director, in the DVD extras, says as much, when he confesses that the gay son Jeremy, probably has the least interesting role in the cast. The eruption that results from Jeremy's news is more an exploration of the various reactions and the collisions of conscience and kindness the main characters have with eachother as a result. I particularly loved the idea that even though the parents are perceived by their children as left-wing liberal their reactions to their son's coming out are unexpected given their political stripe and their perception of themselves. The unexpectedness of the reactions and their emotional core are what make the script believable and the performances by Charlotte de Turckheim and Bernard Le Coq as mother and father, really are the centre of this story. A brilliant jewel box of a film, which has some pleasant surprises as the story is revealed.
Highly recommended.

2884072,5,B000SAAPFW,"""Times Have Been Better"" is the story of a middle-class French family confronting a collection of long-simmering relationship problems in the aftermath of the much admired older son's announcement that he's gay.  Just about everything about this film is intelligent and insightful (with the exception of the inept disc cover graphic.)  All of the characters--gay son, younger brother, mother, father and assorted friends--are presented as real human beings owning a wide variety of hang ups, ambitions, egos and ongoing disappointments.  Reliance on traditional coming out story cliches and stereotypes is generally well and creatively avoided in this particular family story, much to the benefit of the screenplay and the enjoyment of the viewer.  The film's characters all eventually wise up in this film, but in plausible and intelligent ways.  Interesting that this film was conceived and made in France.  It's doubtful that the same effort could come out of Hollywood or even as an Indie production where these subjects have almost always been cliche-bound and focused on physical beauty over basic human behavior.",1200182400,2,1119,5.4393063583815024
2884073,4,B000SAAPFW,"To say ""Times Have Been Better"" is a great film would be a huge statement! Kudos to all those involved in the production of this French film. The acting, the writing, the direction, casting, etc., are combined deftly into one superior film. I have nothing but praise for this film and I'm sure it will be remembered as a classic in years to come. The writing is top notch; this film has it all-- drama, humor and true emotion. This is a family that is completely believable to watch. There is not a false moment or performance to be found. The talented cast is fun to watch (especially the actors playing the father, mother and the two sons) and the supporting cast as well. I highly recommend this movie and just wish American producers could handle such subject matter with the skill and respect that the Europeans do.",1194825600,19,820,4.547297297297297
2884074,4,B000SAAPFW,"TIMES HAVE BEEN BETTER (Le Ciel sur la tte) is a polished little French 'made for television' film that holds its own on every level in the theater and on DVD. The issues it tackles are many, not just the main topic of coming out to a family. This is one of the better, more fully rounded examinations of the contemporary family in recent years.  Based on a story and screenplay by  Nicholas Mercier and directed by R&eacute;gis Musset, this is a sophisticated comedy with some sensitive dramatic overtones presented by a fine cast and superb production values.

J&eacute;r&eacute;my (Arnaud Binard) is the wholly successful business executive son of Rosine (the amazingly fine actress Charlotte de Turckheim) and Guy (Bernard Le Coq) and big brother to Robin (Olivier Gu&eacute;rit&eacute;e). When he pays a surprise visit to his home for an impromptu brunch, his family is in fine spirits until the reason for the surprise visit is made known: J&eacute;r&eacute;my announces to his parents that he is gay and though Robin has known this fact for some time and Rosine has suspected it, the news hits the family unit by storm.  J&eacute;r&eacute;my returns to Paris to his partner Marc (Pierre Deny) and while relieved that he can now live his life in the open, J&eacute;r&eacute;my frets about the trauma to his family unit. Robin gathers the courage to rebel against going to college in favor of following his dream of being involved with cinema, Guy goes into a true depression, and Rosine decides to face the new life of her son, traveling to Paris to meet her son's home and friends and fresh outlook.  While in Paris Rosine discovers her own suppressed needs and with the courage J&eacute;r&eacute;my has shown, she is able to return to her home an altered person.

The cast is very attractive and very fine and story flows so naturally, completely without clich&eacute;, that the movie becomes more a study of human behavior than of a routine 'coming out' movie. Well worth the viewer's time.  In French with English subtitles. Grady Harp, November 07",1194652800,18,2058,4.913544668587896
2884075,5,B000SAAPFW,"it was incredible watching this movie even with the language barrier..it didn't even matter.  subtitles do help but for me i could just feel what the older brother was going through not by my own experience.  But just by seeing how they were reacting to each other as they were filming and how the actors and actresses all worked together to bring across a movie that while funny and dramatic.  Also has some scenes that get you pissed again i'm not one to go telling specific scenes in the movie.  But i will say that the father of the older son first seems cool with his son telling him and mother that he's gay.

But as you progress further into the film he starts losing it, lashing out, slapping his younger son (also a delight to watch in this movie) for something about the lawn.  it is interesting to see how folks really react and feel to a situation not what they are thinking and think that person wants to hear.  It just came across so well and made a huge impression on me long after it was over.  I cant help hope to see all the people in this movie again in something as good as Times Have Been Better.  But its highly rated and recommended by me for rent and then a purchase afterwards.  It will draw in folks no matter what their sexual preference is.

Loved it!!!!",1193011200,26,1282,4.3
2884076,4,B000SAAPFW,"In the French made-for-TV film ""Le Ciel sur la tte"" (""Times Have Been Better"") (2006), Jrmy is 30 year old son of liberal upper middle class parents Guy and Rosine, who comes home in order to tell his parents about his impressive promotion at his work in Paris ... and to finally tell them that he is gay.  His younger brother, Robin, who has known about his brother's sexuality for years, warns him that they are going to be stunned by the news, but neither one of them could have anticipated just how it would affect the relationships between each one of the four family members.

I found this to be a refreshing change on the usual ""coming out"" tale, on several levels.  Obviously, the son is no longer a child, but an adult who finished college and is a success in the business world, but whom has been procrastinating about telling his parents until he was in a relationship, which he is now.  And, from that point, the gay son actually becomes more of a supporting character, as the film concentrates more on the resulting tension between the parents and also the younger son, who unfortunately decides around the same time to postpone college to take a temp job for a film studio. While the initial troubles between the parents seem to have been triggered by the revelation of the son's sexuality, it also soon becomes obvious that the problems are buried much deeper than that, and have existed through most of their marriage.  The turmoil of the relationship also alienates good friends of both Guy and Rosine, and pushes Rosine to seek out advice and support from her gay co-worker, whom she doesn't particularly like.  The film is a light but intelligent reminder about how important communication is in any relationship, and how being ""open minded"" is often tougher than it seems.

DVD has brief ""making of"" featurette (dubbed in English, although the film itself is in French with subtitles, and may need some pausing and replays, since the dialogue comes through pretty fast at times.) and photo gallery.  I give it four stars out of five.",1190851200,19,2053,4.6991643454039

8205022,5,B000SAAPFW,"GENERAL: The late coming out of a young man to his parents. The film is more focused on the parents than on the young concerned.

POSITIVE ASPECTS: Surprising realism coming from the reaction of the supposedly liberal parents. Beauty of the relationship between the brothers. Dualism between the rationality of the father and the big brother on one side and the emotional intelligence of the mother and the little brother on the other side. Many unspoken truths are put on the screen: the difference between what we look like and what we do, the fact that one of the children is more beloved than the other, the mother who needs to feel like a woman, the fathers manhood that is challenged by his son, the limit of the organized and rational men and the escape from reality. The limit of the organized and rational men is well expressed when the father confesses to his son that it is the mother the smartest, since she can live in disorder. Indeed, she managed to love his son as they are and not how she wants them to be. The example of escape from reality surprises early in the film. Indeed, one quickly realizes that it is not going very well: the son who smokes pot, the mother who takes pills and the father who drinks. From the beginning, we embark in the film; thanks to lively music for young people, the definition of a Sunday by the young and the general realism imbued with a humorous touch. Even if the boss of the mother is detestable by his remarks and manners, he still manages to seize out what happens and help the mother. Especially when he told to the mother that her boy will never end like him because of the value of love she learned to her son, the love she gave to her son and the love that is now in her son. Later, his son will reassure his mother with by saying that love does not just hold for kids. The film shows with simplicity, humor and emotion a reality that is even well-established in our society.

NEGATIVE ASPECTS: Sometimes a little too caricatured, especially for the father with his silly friends.

AVENUES OF REFLECTION: Do we love our children as much as we pretend? Are we open as we say? And when it happens in our backyard? Are we able to apply our principles and ideals when we are faced with a problem in our own lives?",1435190400,,2269,4.4105011933174225
8205023,5,B000SAAPFW,"Wow! This movie is fun to watch and is told through the eyes of the parents.  This is a French made-for-television film about a liberal, leftest family. The oldest son is handsome, successful and has been in the closed all his life.  Only his younger brother knows.  But when he has a lover who he moves in with, he decides to come out to his family and after all, they are liberal and will understand.  They are liberal and are okay with families with gay sons.  This is true.  But their son, how can that be?  Not their son!..The father can't believe it and doesn't know how to deal with it and the mother at first shaken loves her son no matter what.  As I have said, it is a fun movie to watch, especially how the father and mother reverse roles in their liberalism regarding their son's gay life style.  In the end they both accept it as they both love their son no matter what.",1419120000,,883,4.2395209580838324
8205024,5,B000SAAPFW,"Very smart, very funny, and ultimately very touching coming out film, from director Rgis Musset.  Jeremy (Arnaud Binard), a successful young businessman, finally informs  his parents he is gay.  Refreshingly, this movie focuses not on an angst-ridden son (he is, in fact, the most well-adjusted member of the family) but rather on the effect his announcement has on his parents, Guy (Bernard Le Coq) and Rosine (Charlotte de Turckheim).  Supposedly liberal, they find it very difficult to accept that their son is gay, especially his father.  Poor Jeremy has to contend with a rebellious younger brother, and the collapse of his parent's marriage.

Although this is a gay-themed movie, Jeremy and his boyfriend actually appear very little in the movie.

The entire cast is wonderful, with Chantal Ladesou as Rosine's outspoken, chain-smoking best friend, and Franck de la Personne as Rosine's flamboyant co-worker, especially good.  But the film belongs to de Turckheim as a mother who finally comes to accept her son, her husband, and most importantly herself.  She is superb.

For anyone who wants to enjoy a witty, sophisticated comedy that only the French (or, sadly, just about any country other than America) can make, ""Times Have Been Better"" is a must-see.",1312243200,,1264,5.182266009852217
8205025,4,B000SAAPFW,"""Times have been better"" is a warm film, with a comedy touch. If you like European cinema, you will not be disappointed.
I decided to see it after I had seen ""Cockles and muscles"" (which, btw, is even more enjoyable than this one).
The main theme here is the homosexuality of Jeremy, the older son of Rosin and Guy. Until their own son came out of the closet, they considered themselves to be very open-minded...Well, as we can see some things sometimes are not so easy to accept as we thought they would be.

In my opinion this is one of the movies I would like to have in private collection. Both story and acting are great. Pictures (Paris at nite), chosen sceneries are eye catching too.

8205026,5,B000SAAPFW,"The movie is not ""exactly"" a gay romance, since Jeremy, the son who comes out to his family, drops the news and then leaves the family to deal with it alone. Both parents have always considered themself ""open"", but probably since the ""bad"" things always happened to other people. The revelation of Jeremy's homosexuality mines their happy ground. So this is more the story of how they comes out for who really they are. The side romance between Jeremy and Marc is really nice, I wouldn't mind to have a movie only for their own.",1278288000,,528,4.568421052631579
8205027,5,B000SAAPFW,"Honest and at times raw with emotion. This is a tale all families, even those without a gay member, should see. It is my hope word of this film will filter into homes with families who do not talk with (as opposed to at) each other, and loved ones will take a serious look at what it is to love someone instead of loving who you want them to be.
This is not your typical coming out movie. It is so much more.",1256515200,,408,3.927710843373494
8205028,5,B000SAAPFW,Times Have Been Better was an excellent coming out story.  I highly recommend it as it is one of the better gay films.  It is a funny tear jerker with a very interesting story line.,1254960000,,181,4.142857142857143
8205029,5,B000SAAPFW,"The quality of this French tele-movie is so high that I expected it to have been one which received cinematic release.

The English subtitles are very well crafted and made enjoying the film to the utmost a breeze - stirring every emotion (including plenty of out loud laughter, and a few tears).

The 24 minute ""behind the scenes"" extra feature does a great job with supplementary information - in the main part reinforcing my own understanding and appreciation of the fimmakers' fully realised intentions.

I deeply cared about these characters, I loved how their stories evolved. As the writer states, it's not a guide to coming out - but it is certainly an ideal film for fostering awareness of the struggle faced even by ""open minded"" parents who have discovered that their envisioned future for their child will be needing some radical re-evaluation.

As close to perfect as any film I've seen and fully deserving five stars.",1230336000,,931,4.910828025477707
