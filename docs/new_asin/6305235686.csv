More updated videos are available.",1525996800,,199,5.0606060606060606

7885552,5,6305235686,"I can't speak highly enough about ""Dogs, Cats & Kids"". I teach 'dog bite prevention' in the Georgia School system and after bringing our program, 'Bear's World' to more than 10,000 Pre-school thru 4th grade students, I am still in awe when 2 and 3 year children stand to imitate standing still like a 'tree' while the video is playing or get all the questions right during the 'quiz' at the end of the video. I have watched children that were terrified of dogs come up to me and 'Bear' (the 2 year old Golden Retriever in our program) and tell me they are not afraid of dogs anymore and ask to watch the 'movie' again. I love the way the video teaches children how to tell when dogs and cats are happy, sad, angry or just want to be left alone in a FUN and non threatening manner. One of the most important lessons the children learn from the video is what to do if they are approached by a stray dog while outside. Standing still like a 'tree' or if on the ground curling up like a 'rock' is another one of the kids 'favorite parts' and they ask to do it again and again. ""Dogs, Cats & Kids"" is the 'centerpiece' of our program and I believe this video should be viewed by ALL families with children whether they have a companion animal in their home or not.",1031961600,7,1259,4.228215767634855
