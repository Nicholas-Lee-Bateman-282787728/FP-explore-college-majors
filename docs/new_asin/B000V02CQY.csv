8216046,5,B000V02CQY,"I really loved watching this. I especially like all the film footage from the days when she was a little girl. Studying her face, her calmness & self-possession at a very young age are quite remarkable. Like her father & grandmother, Queen Mary, she is almost never talking or speaking to anyone. It's almost as if Queen Mary had said something like:  'Don't prattle on when there are cameras about or you'll look like a fish in tomorrow's newspapers!' I DID NOT LIKE and DO NOT AGREE WITH Andrew Morton's conclusion (repeated by several of his interviewees) that the Queen, never having taken ""a wrong step"" during her reign, took a disastrous one by not returning to London right away with all the family, including William and Harry, after Princess Diana's death in 1997. She did EXACTLY what any decent person would do under the circumstances - she thought of the boys' welfare, and kept them away from the circus London had become the week before Diana's funeral and allowed them time to grieve. She's never yet put a foot wrong as far as I'm concerned. This dvd only confirmed that feeling.",1368316800,3,1096,4.708333333333333
8216047,4,B000V02CQY,"She prayed for a baby brother at the age of ten when her father became King. Queen  Mother probably told her about how to deal with stone-faced mother-in-law, Queen Mary.  She knew how Princess Diana felt but hid her feeling behind her mask. As an aged monarch like Queen Victoria, she could care more how Ms. Middleton be treated by Prince Charles and Prince William. Ms. Middleton would be another royal stone face.

If not from her mother, she wouldn't be charming at young age and graceful being old, yet Mr. Morton thinks her smiles being phony.",1280102400,6,550,4.649484536082475
8216048,5,B000V02CQY,"I loved this documentary because Andrew Morton examines the Queen's life as a newly wed and actually goes to Malta and visits the place where she stayed and the place where she and Phillip used to go dancing.  He even interviews the hairdresser who kept a clipping of the then Princess Elizabeth's hair from that time.  Out of all of the documentaries I own about the Royal Family, this is THE ONLY ONE that examines the years before she became Queen.  One can actually see the marked transformation from the young and vibrant newly wed to the serious, reserved woman she became after ascending the throne.",1211500800,17,606,4.69811320754717
8216049,5,B000V02CQY,"I found this DVD to be very enlightening.  Andrew Morton, who has written many books about the Royal Family of England, certainly gave me some new insights about the Queen.",1198108800,10,172,4.733333333333333
