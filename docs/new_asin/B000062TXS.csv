1684120,3,B000062TXS,"Highlander: The Series was a fantastic TV Show.  In my opinion, it far outdid any of the Highlander Movies because in episodic form, it could provide so much more depth to the characters than a 90 min. movie could.
I purchased this season set from the official Highlander site about a year ago.  I paid MUCH MORE than Amazon is offering it for...but at the time there was no other way to get it.
This first season set contains what is commonly thought of by Highlander fans as the weakest set of episodes of any of the seasons.  However, it does contain a few gems - ""The Gathering"" co-stars Christopher Lambert as ""Connor MacLeod"" in the only pairing of Duncan and Connor in the series run (until Highlander 4, of course).  ""For Tomorrow We Die"" was another great episode with the first appearance of Xavier St. Cloud (Fine Young Cannibals' Roland Gift) and the season ending ""The Hunters"" (which introduced the watchers to the Highlander Universe).
The transfer is quite good - easily better than the VHS version and therefore the best you are going to get.  Watchers' files are included on the discs which give you information on the immortals in each episode - kind of neat, but unless you have a very large TV, you may find it hard to read. The Highlander blooper reel and the behind the scenes initial promo video are also included with this set.  There is also a feature that allows you to go directly to the quickening (if there was one) in an episode.
Also included was a CD-Rom of the entire first season's scripts.
As a completist, I would've gotten this season anyway, but I find that although there are some weak episodes here, most series start out this way (Star Trek The Next Generation) but get better as they progress.  I am truly looking forward to seasons 2 and 3 and am hoping that they will be forthcoming sooner rather than later.",1032480000,4,1853,4.563253012048193

1684122,3,B000062TXS,"For those of us whose ears are still ringing with that phrase from the first Highlander movie ""there can be only one,"" we often wonder why there are so many sequels, not to mention this TV spin-off.  The answer is simple: money.
Part of the intrigue of the first movie was that all-encompassing, somewhat mysterious storyline, and we assumed that Connor McLeod was the only surviving immortal.  Apparently, he didn't know there were still so many others lurking around!  Still, though, if you can get past that obvious (gaping) hole in the story, the sequels (not counting the 2nd one, which was pure crap) and the series are cool additions that expand on the universe of the immortals.
This series follows the life of Duncan McLeod, clansman of Connor.  They have known each other for centuries, and Duncan was trained by his kinsman.  The first episode features a guest spot by Christopher Lambert, and elaborates a lot on the story.  Most of the rest of the episodes follow Duncan's exploits and flashbacks that lead him to many adventures.
Though this series is definitely not for everyone, the die-hard Highlander fans who remained unfulfilled by the story in the first movie will be greatly gratified by these additions.",1028160000,3,1226,4.898550724637682

1684160,5,B000062TXS,"Before ""Game of Thrones"" the must watch TV series of the 80's-90's in syndication was ""Highlander!"" Based on the movie but the exploits here were of Duncan MacLeod, a related family member, starring the dashing pony tailed Adrian Paul. This show was the first series to exhibit great choreography with swords, great time piece costumes, and special effects! The show lasted about 6 season and was stopped by Mr. Adrian Paul who grew tired of the role so the last season was abbreviated as long as he agreed to appear in a couple more Highlander movies, which he did. This episode features as a guest star the beautiful Vanity ( from the lore of ""Prince"" singers and musicians). Many popular actors and actresses of the time appeared on the show from time to time including Nia Peeples , as Cleopatra ( seductive as ever).",1461715200,,821,4.708333333333333

1684167,2,B000062TXS,"Back in the 90's, when this series was airing, I was totally hooked and never missed an episode. I looked this one up and streamed it, because I remembered by it's title that it was one I liked. But I'm amazed at how cheezy and dated it is watching it now. I really didn't remember that it was such bad acting by the extras and such...I mean really, really bad! But I always like the flashbacks and the fight scenes. You can tell that Adrian Paul is a talented swordsman and a skilled martial artist. And the concept of an average street thug unwittingly going toe-to-toe against a guy that's been doing hand to hand combat for 400 years is fun. It's satisfying seeing the supposedly tough bad guys get their butts kicked by a character that could do it with his eyes closed and one hand tied behind his back.",1458345600,,809,4.364238410596027

I have stayed up & got very little sleep because I can't stop watching. Takes  me back... but it's amazing how the passing of time affects how you remember things.

This season is mainly about Duncan, Tessa and Richie.  Tessa is very beautiful and quite spirited.  She's a delightful woman and a perfect match for Duncan. Duncan and Tessa take in and mentor Richie.  He's youthful, loyal and street smart.

Duncan Macleod is the main immortal character in the series.  Connor Macloed was his first teacher.  Connor taught Duncan what it means to be Immortal.  Beyond that they're both from the same clan.  Duncan and Connor are brothers in Spirit, Battle, Blood and every way except birth.

Throughout the centuries Duncan left Scotland, travel throughout Europe and Across Asia.  From there he returned to Europe and then went to the Americas. From his travels he gained the Warrior skills from each of those cultures.  He also gained skills in tracking, healing, and meditation.  Eventually he limits his involvement in Mortal Wars.

1684233,5,B000062TXS,"I'm biased though. If I'm not in Scotland then I'm thinking of being there so the premise for this series is seems natural to me. The actors are all well cast and most of the scripts deal with issues of trust and honor so it carries this beyond just a gash and slash type of series. Sure, there is violence but it's well done with reserve and the one aspect that sets this series apart is that things are done for honor and not senseless power on the part of Duncan MacLeod. I've been all over the ancient MacLeod lands in the west of Scotland & Islands and it's easy to see this series being 'alive'. Thoroughly enjoyable series with good personal interactions and emotions among those who befriend each other and protect each other. Many good lessons in patience and kindness to be seen.",1397865600,,789,4.448275862068965

Adrian Paul, Stan Kirsch and Alexandra Vandernoot did a wonderful job of portraying a very fanciful idea of life so that I could believe it.

The discs are neither captioned nor subtitled, and no additional languages are available in any form, either through subtitles or audio.  Since I have a hearing problem, I frequently turn on either captions or subtitles.  I'm more than a little annoyed this has neither.  Also, it's more than a little interesting to watch ""The Gathering"" in French, since Christopher Lambert dubs his own lines.  :-)  In general, I find watching DVDs in foreign languages educational and helpful in relearning a language I no longer understand as well as I'd like.  Unfortunately, no foreign language options are available with these discs.

On another note, I have no idea why someone decided it was a good idea to use half a box to hold 3 sets of 3 discs each, but the half box idea was dumb.  A full box works so much better to hold and protect the disc sets.

So, 5 stars for the episodes, but 1 star off for packaging and lack of text and audio language features.  I'd be inclined to take off more stars if my hearing were worse.",1156377600,9,1278,4.524017467248909

When the DVDs were first released, I, in a fit of enthusiasm, ordered a set only to return it because of no CC.

Other than the lack of cc, the series is very good.  Admittedly, the first season had a few bumps while the actors were getting the feel of the characters but what series doesn't go through that, initially?

The stories are great, the locations are wonderful (especially in Europe), and one does get sucked into the mythology. I highly recommend this as escapist fare.",1141776000,14,731,4.377777777777778

THings get better towards the end of the season, as some recurring characters and long-running plot threads begin to take root.

  On the whole i enjoyed the series very much, with some terrific special effects, colourful plots, great flashbacks and special guests, powerful immortals and emotional pitfalls yet to come.",1124236800,,651,4.692982456140351
1684366,5,B000062TXS,"I love this series and have watched most episodes, but it is great to be able to go back and see them again, in order. Most people know the basics that serve as foundation for the story; Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) is a four-hundred-year-old immortal who can only die if someone cuts his head. The problem is that there are other immortals out there, and when they kill one of their own they absorb his power. In the end, when the time of the Gathering arrives, there can only be one; and this moment is getting closer and closer. Since the goal is to cut their opponent's head, the fights are mostly with swords, and the choreography used in these scenes is believable and entertaining to watch.

In order to give this series continuity with the movies that serve as the basis, there is a brief appearance by Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, who is Duncan's ""cousin"" and mentor. From that moment on, the series stands on its own, and besides Duncan, the main characters are Tessa (Alexandra Vandernoot), his mortal girlfriend who sells antiques, and Richie (Stan Kirsch), a kid who loves to get in trouble with the law.

The series has a good continuity, but most chapters stand pretty well on their own. Of course my recommendation is that you watch them in order, so you can maximize your enjoyment and understanding of what is going on. Especially since one of the aspects I enjoyed most was to learn the rules that govern the lives of the immortals. These rules are revealed little by little and every time we come across a new one, we find ourselves thinking about past episodes and understanding things better.

Most episodes follow the same basic pattern, with a situation presenting itself to Duncan (usually involving another immortal), the tension building up and at the same time Duncan remembering an event from his past related to the present one, and a grand finale with an all out confrontation. The good thing is that even though this pattern is pretty consistent, the creators provide us with enough variety to keep us interested. One fact that may help in this sense is that there are several different writers across the various episodes. All of them share a trait though, and that is the ability to infuse each installment with a high level of suspense, usually through the endangerment of Duncan or someone he loves.

It was very interesting to me to watch the evolution of the actors in this series, since in the first half of this season I found Adrian Paul and Alexandra Vandernoot to be a little stiff and unnatural in their performances. But as the series progressed, they became much better and at ease in their roles. The case of Stan Kirsch is different, since he fits the role to the T since the first episode, and he fulfills the task of bringing some humor to the series in a highly proficient manner.

Due to the nature of the series and of the different places in which Duncan has lived throughout the years, we get to see a huge variety of settings. The creators of the series really excelled in this aspect, especially during Duncan's flashbacks to ancient times. In terms of the present action, the first half of the season develops in the US and the second part in Paris, allowing for the introduction of new secondary characters and even of the way the story progresses. Finally, another attractive feature of this series is the music, with a main theme by Queen that fits the mood very well.

For those of you that are already fans of this series and want something extra besides the episodes, you will get a behind the scenes feature that is pretty interesting and some bloopers during filming. If you like action series in a fantastic setting, you cannot do better than with this one!",1119571200,28,3734,4.658573596358118

So what in the blazes do you we do now?""  Of course, the answer was simple: make a TV series!
Well - maybe not that simple.
THE SERIES
Highlander (also known as Highlander: The Series) began its television life in 1992.  Ladies' man Adrian Paul (once considered for the role of James Bond) played 400-year-old Duncan MacLeod, part of a race of Immortals who lurk in society's shadows.  You cannot kill them, and they will live forever - unless, of course, you grab your trusty sword and decapitate them.
The first season of Highlander was all about grabbing an audience, and allowing the show to find its footing.  The show got off to a reasonable start with its premiere episode, ""The Gathering"" (which featured Christopher Lambert, star of the film series).  Eventually, the show began to evolve from an oddball sci-fi actioner to a sci-fi/action drama with brains.  One of the best things about the first season of the show is watching its evolution, which is wonderfully apparent throughout the 22 episodes.  [7/10]
THE VIDEO
Anchor Bay is my favorite DVD manufacturer.  Never before have I come across a bad A.B. DVD, and Highlander is, happily, not the first.  The video isn't excellent - there is some grain around here, and the first episode is very dark - but its enough to make anyone happy. [7/10]
THE AUDIO
Anchor Bay has done a great job with the audio.  It sounds great in surround speakers (Queen rocks better than ever, man!).
During the Quickenings, the effect of the scene is heightened by the booming surround.  The 5.1 mix is great; my only complaint is that quite often Roger Bellon's score goes way above the speaking of the characters, which can become annoying.
[8/10]
THE EXTRAS
As always, Anchor Bay meets my expectations.  There is Watcher Chronicles for the true Immie fan (although the Watchers didn't actually feature in the show until the second season), as well as a feature that allows you to go straight to the Quickening in each episode.  The final disc also includes an enjoyable Blooper Reel as well as scripts for all 22 episodes and a series promo.  [9/10]
All in all, Highlander: The Series gets off to a great start on DVD thanks to Anchor Bay.  Any Highlander fan will be completely satisfied.  Great job, Anchor Bay!
OVERALL: [8/10]

THE SERIES: [7/10] Fine start to an outstanding show.
THE VIDEO: [7/10] Nice job.  Some grain, but nothing too bothersome.
THE AUDIO: [8/10] Occasional unbalance, but a great 5.1 mix nonetheless.
THE EXTRAS: [9/10] Enough to satisfy the Immortal inside anyone and everyone!
OVERALL SCORE: [8/10] Highlander: The Series rocked 12 years ago, and now - thanks to Anchor Bay - it rocks again.

1684373,5,B000062TXS,"I remember watching the highlander television series as a kid, trying to catch it when it was on. I missed most episodes though, and was pleased to see they had put it out on DVD. Overall it's a nice box set, not quite as nice as some out there, but it holds up okay.
 There's 3 episodes per disk, except for the eighth disk, which has one episode, a blooper reel, and a behind the scenes featurette. The ninth disk is reserved for the scripts of each episode, which is a nice touch. I did wonder why they chose 3 episodes per disk, it's an unusual number, and they could have put four or five on a disk. I can only guess that they wanted a large number of disks to make it look impressive.
 Each disk is pretty simple; there's no fancy introduction, just the Highlander logo with a still from each of the three episodes below it. A lightning bolt lets you select the episode, which takes you to the menu. The menu is a little confusing, but it gives you more shots from the episode so you can determine if you've seen it, or if you want to see it. One thing that's nice is the Watcher Chronicles. Even though there was little mention of the Watcher's in this season, there's a special screen detailing Watcher information, like the immortals and mortals involved in each episode, swords used, etc etc. It's kind of useful.
 Another nice thing in the episode menu is the large Q that allows you to skip directly to the Quickening sequence, if there is one in that episode. This is great if you want to watch the fight scenes, or if you want to know when to look away if they make you squeamish.
 There aren't a large amount of special features, but for the price and the number of disks it's a good deal. It also takes up a lot less space than the VHS tapes for the same season.",1081036800,,1778,4.2514792899408285
1684374,5,B000062TXS,"Watch the birth of a legend! Highlander: The Series, Season 1 on DVD is a collection of all 22-episodes of the premiere season. See how it all started with Christopher Lambert reprising his role as Connor MacLeod, cousin to Duncan, as a guest star in the very first episode. ""Same clan, different vintage."" It was the perfect tie-in to the movies and a nice hand-off from Christopher to Adrian. From the very first episode the action, adventure and romance that would become hallmark to this series began. We see a friendship grow with Richie Ryan, a young mortal whom Duncan and Tessa befriend from the start.
Season 1 also introduced us to many memorable and seminal characters such as Amanda, played by Elizabeth Gracen and Hugh Fitzcairn (Roger Daltrey), two of the best characters to repeatedly show up for all six seasons. And the recurring bad guys would become icons themselves with Peter Hudson playing the evil Watcher James Horton and Roland Gift as Xavier St. Cloud. Both of these actors made such an impact that they were brought back for several more episodes over the next six years. Many of the episodes in this first season established canon early on. Episodes such as ""The Gathering,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" and ""The Hunters"" all established core concepts that would be built upon in the years to come.
This DVD collection also comes with a ton of bonus features beginning with Bill Panzer providing a short commentary before almost every episode. He addresses where story ideas came from, problems with filming, and even the untimely death of Werner Stocker, the actor who played Darius. Disc 8 contains a fantastic Blooper Real set to music and a behind the scenes 30-minute series promo produced to sell the show and introduce it to the public. You get to see many of the behind-the-scenes faces that, early on, were responsible for getting the show on the air. What's even more special is that this promo has interviews with Bob Anderson, the sword fight choreographer for Seasons 1 and 2. It is rare to find an interview with him. Highlander Season 1 is a must have for starting a Highlander DVD collection.",1079654400,,2127,4.814207650273224

It is a constant debate among fans of SF/Fantasy as to which telivision series based on a movie or movie franchise translates best to the small screen.  Well folks, this is one of the major contenders!
  Duncan Macleod is the cousin of Conner from the original movie and has come to tell us that The Gathering hasn't ended and Conner needs to rejoin the game. Conner is reluctant but, when his lady love is put in danger its time to get back to business.

The watcher files were too small to read and Mr. Panzar's explanation of each epsisode is pretty rough. After the first two episodes, I skipped the watcher files completely, and patiently watched and listened as Mr. Panzar recounted some history of the making of each episode.",1075766400,,429,4.657894736842105

What I liked about the DVD set is the extras: commentaries, scripts, bloopers and behind the scenes stuff.  What I didn't like about the DVD set is the poor DVD encoding quality.  The first time I saw such poor encoding quality was in Warner Brothers - The Matrix DVD.  I have just over 200 DVD's in my collection, many of the $5.99 variety, and none have as poor visual quality as the Highlander Series of DVD sets (all 3 so far).  I'm sure Anchor Bay knew well that these DVD sets would sell to the fans of Highlander regardless of DVD quality.  It's a shame they did this, and Adrian Paul and the other stars of the series should call Anchor Bay and complain.",1073692800,,753,4.26056338028169

As the series goes on you can see that the writers, directors, and actors really hit their stride and each episode is better and better.  The 'extras' really explain what was going on behind the scenes, such as why a major character like Darius was suddenly 'not there'.

It explains, much of the story of his love of Tess, how Richie came to be his student and immortal, as well as gives you a good bit of his own history.
The Quickenings are not as brillant as they are in later years, but if you are a Highlander fan it is definetly worth the effort to go ahead and buy the series",1060387200,3,488,4.041237113402062
1684383,4,B000062TXS,"If you like the premise the series will not disappoint you.  That said ever since I got a DVD player I find it hard to go back to the VHS tapes.  I watched highlander for the first few seasons when it was on TV but eventually lost track of it.  I had seen the video collections out in stores but did not like the price or the idea of pulling my old VHS player out of the closet.  With the release of the DVD set for season one I decided to see if it was as good a series as I remember.  Amazingly it was just as good - if not better.  After the first season Duncan will forever be the real Highlander and Conner just a distant cousin.  Adrian Paul takes over from the start and becomes ""The Highlander"".  The supporting cast and guest stars are also great but it is Mr. Paul who keeps you coming back.  My only gripe with the DVD's is that they did not have more interviews with the actors and the writers.  For a show that has taken on such a cult following it would have been nice to hear some of the early history about the first season.  My other complaint is not about the DVD set which I highly recommend but about the slow way the DVD's are hitting the market.  Season 2 is slated to come out in July 03, and as of yet I have not heard when the other seasons will be released (if at all) on DVD.

Adrian Paul plays the title role, as the immortal we would all like to either be, or have as a lover.  (Every girl's fantasy of the protective, yet sensitive male.)

1684389,5,B000062TXS,"Loved this set.  My 12 year old refused to watch any of the shows for the first two days, so my husband and I enjoyed watching this on our big screen with the bass turned up.  Then the 12 year old came down for something to eat ... and has bugged us to watch the whole set in one week.  She loves it.
We loved the first 9 episodes the best.  Since we had to move overseas and missed some of the series, we are anxiously awaiting the next set.  I hope it is released this summer.

We have  20, 12, 7 year-old daughters and they all voted a Bad Day in Building A (one of their cheaper episodes) as the best.  They just wanted them to have a little more fun with the parking tickets.  If you ever go to Europe you will get a hoot out of this Dutch surnamed French sculptor fussing about having to pay parking tickets.  Parking over there is murder.
We liked this episode because it wasn't about one immortal trying to kill another.  It was about an immortal saving these innocents from vicious killer, messing with the police as he does his hero thing.
The series is about an immortal who is living with this sculptor he met in France, but they moved to Seattle (actually I think they are in Vancouver, Canada).
The first episode sets up the immortal fellow to become a mentor to a troubled youth.  The orphaned youth, later in the series, finds out he is immortal.  The only way an immortal can be killed is by losing their heads, literally.  So there is always lots of sword play and the implied beheading of some evil immortal or some evil clan of immortal haters.  But in this set, the good guy prevails and saves the weak and defenseless.  His lover is loyal and very courageous.  And the troubled youth is a great comic relief side kick.  Becomes like an adopted son. Love story and action and adventure with a good bit of humor.  What else could you want.
Later the series takes a dark turn and loses some of its charm over in Europe.....but that's another season.",1043884800,4,1968,4.298913043478261

1684392,4,B000062TXS,"Well if you're reading any of these reviews it's obvious that you are already a Highlander fan, so I shouldn't have to explain anything about the show here. I must say that I bought the set when it originally came out on the Highlander website, and even though it cost me an arm and a leg, I was satisfied. I read reports of how other people received defective sets, the packaging was poor, etc. etc. My set played perfectly however. Then came Anchor Bay, with a much cooler package design and a very affordable price. Needless to say, I was a bit miffed about buying it directly from Davis/Panzer. Still, it'll teach me a lesson to wait for AB to release the further seasons on DVD (Season 2 is scheduled for this summer).
About the set itself, it's pretty high quality for a TV show transfer. There could have been better DVD extras, but we're really just buying this to get the Series on DVD anyway. The Season 1 shows are OK...but I'm really looking forward to Seasons 4 & 5.",1040860800,19,979,4.414364640883978

Also there is a DVD with the original shooting scripts for this season.  For those of us who just want to watch the Quickenings, there's a button on the menu of each episode that takes you right to the start of the scene.  Little things that makes this set nice.

1684395,4,B000062TXS,".... You're probably a fan already. Let's face it, the majority of the people who're fans of this show are women drooling over an actor who're straight off the cover of a romance book, and they play up that aspect a bit in the show. There's some flashback shots of our hero in white ruffled blouses riding to the rescue on a white stallion... The good news is the show doesn't always take itself seriously.
The other half or third of the fans are people with a strong predisposition to own lots of sharp pointy things (with one edge or two?), go to ren faires, and talk sensibly about the origins of damascus steel while scarfing down copius amounts of sushi. (Is that a claymore in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?)
I was something of an Adrian Paul fan as a teen, a caryover from ""War of the Worlds"". As I was also a fan of the original Highlander movie, it was natural that I watch the show. Now, years later, it's out on DVD... and I bought it. And watched it. (well, obviously... duh...)
I'm seeing flaws I didn't see as a teen (and some I did see but forgave)... like the first episode (how obvious, exactly, do you really need to be? And how much contempt do producers have for their viewing audience?)
But I'm also seeing some decent programing. Adrian Paul brings a sense of humor to the show (beware the bloopers: preview before watching with small children), and the characters Tessa and Ritchie begin to make up a family. It takes a bit in the begining for it all to gel, like any new team; but when it does work, it works like wild.
The martial arts scenes range from amazing to amusing; some of the stars are very very good at what they do, others are... well, they're lovers, not fighters. Or at least I hope they're lovers, because otherwise they've got nothing going for them at all.
On the DVD's themselves, it can be a bit tough to navigate to the episodes: the screen is a bit confusing and takes some getting used to.
All in all, I'm glad I bought it, and I'll be getting the second season when it comes out. Maybe the third season, I'm not sure; the show underwent some changes then and I'm not entirely sure they were for the best. We'll see.",1039305600,3,2177,4.32518337408313

THE DVD EXTRAS
By far, this set clearly has one of THE best DVD extras packages you'll ever see.
COMMENTARY AND NOTES
ALL EPISODES include commentary from producer Bill Panzer and ""Watcher"" notes.  The producer commentary provides great insight into the situations surrounding each episode production including location, special FX or the actors and actresses.  The ""Watcher"" notes gives additional background and provides more insight into ""Highlander"" canon with reference to events and characters.  In all, these two features alone make purchase of the DVD well worth it.  BUT, there's more...
BLOOPERS
Disc 8 includes the ""Highlander Blooper Reel.""  Nearly 20 minutes of stunts gone wrong, lines flubbed and other hilarious outtakes featuring our favorite ""Immortal"" stars.
BEHIND THE SCENES
This is the half hour documentary used to promo the series before it debuted in 1992.  Like most ""behind the scenes"" features we get the standard on-location footage and interviews with the cast and production crew.
THE SCRIPTS
Disc 9 includes the finalized shooting scripts for ALL 22 episodes in season one.  The scripts are presented in Flash format.  The scripts are a Highlander completist's dream as it includes all the lines and all the stage directions.
THE VERDICT
This series may have passed by a lot of people's radars due to syndication, but lovers of action-adventure and romance are bound to fall in love with this series.  The ""historical"" flashbacks to earlier time periods in the Immortal's lives are something unique not seen in TV before or since.  The martial arts and swashbuckling action will fix most people's action craving and the countless romantic ""love scenes"" featured in the series will reel in the ladies too.  If you've never been exposed to world of Highlander before check this series out and see what Highlander fans have known for years, ""In The End, There Can Be Only One""  -- and this series is it!!

1684398,5,B000062TXS,"highlander the series was the first television series that compelled me to want to buy every episode and i bought all the six seasons on vhs from the official site..since then i have bought a few other shows(stargate sg-1,buffy,24, friends etc..)but none of them has been as captivating as watching one mans struggle to do the right thing at all costs. When the official site offered the dvds of the first season i scoffed at the price they were asking but still wanted them, but i bided my time and waited (almost an eternity) for a general release  knowing that it would be less expensive, and thank darius here it is. needless to say i bought this as soon as it was released and watched it over the next two days everything is intact episodes are full and complete video quality is better than vhs but alot of the darker colors get grainy ( so are the vhs)....but it will never degrade and it still looks awsome.
  if you like well written well thought out television this is for you...if you enjoyed the first movie just know that the series blows it away as far as depth and lore.
  this is about good overcoming evil""nice guys finish last"" or so i've been told....but it is so well done that even if you have watched an episode 3 or 4 times you can come away from it with somthing new.
  in the highlander universe there is only HIGHLANDER,HIGHLANDER THE SERIES AND HIGHLANDER..ENDGAME..trust me you can live without the second and third movies.
  if you are unfamiliar with highlander BUT enjoyed ""24"",""stargate sg-1"", ""buffy the vampire slayer"",""star trek the next generation""....know that all of these series have a similar depth and writing style.obviously they have differing themes but if you enjoyed one of them you should enjoy all of them",1039132800,18,1753,4.665584415584416

The episodes are approximately 48 minutes long including opening and closing credits, and nothing is missing on my set of DVDs.

1684401,1,B000062TXS,"The opening scenes from almost all of the episodes have been omitted.  These are the scenes that are crutial to the telling of each story.  I do not, at this time, know if all sets are involved, or, if it is a quality control problem that occured when the episodes were transferred from tape to disk.  Persons viewing these for the first time are going to be very confused and wonder why the series recieved such good reviews.  Is my set a fluke or are all the new dvd sets flawed?  Dissapointed in Nashville...",1038009600,8,511,4.3936170212765955
1684402,5,B000062TXS,"Highlander was a series that although very well done, could not hold a decent time slot.  When it first aired I was only 8 years old and when I fianlly grew up enough to want to watch it, it had bounced from to many stations to keep track.  Well now it is here on DVD and it ruely kicks ....
The series focused on Duncan McKloud (which for those who don't know anything about highlander is not to be mistaken by CHristopher LAmbert from the Films) who runs an antique shop while dueling immortals whenever they arrive.  Duncan McKloud is played by Adrian Paul which to my knowledge the only other thing I have seen him in is the movie ""THe BReed"".  Along with his wife Tesa and friend Richie they live their life in the antiwue store while mystical adventures, as well as real life ones stumble in their way.
SO basically if you are in to swordplay, early 90's rock and roll, and good story, than this is the series to check into.",1037318400,2,930,4.297142857142857
1684403,5,B000062TXS,"I have been waiting for this series to be put on dvd for quite a while. Oh sure, if you were willing to spend more than twice the money you could've bought season one from the Highlander website (which a friend of mine did), but I held out hope that eventually a more affordable version would come out for purchase in stores. Not only is this set less expensive, it's also better designed. Graphically the box art is much smarter looking and the box itself with it's fold out cases within a case is a space saver on my dvd shelf.
  Now on to the episodes...It's interesting in the beginning of the series to see how the Highlander movie continuity is incorporated into the TV show. It's not a totally seamless transition, you almost get the feeling that the producers weren't sure themselves how they were going to handle it. As the season progresses however, Duncan MacLeod and the series begin to find their own voices. I would highly recommend this set to existing fans of the series as well as people who might have never even heard of Highlander, there seems to be something appealing in it for everyone.",1037059200,23,1109,4.54
1684404,5,B000062TXS,"I own all of the Highlander movies, as well as all of the Highlander: The Series 1-6. I don't think there was ever a better series on T.V. Not only is Adrian Paul fantastic to look at, the theme and messages were very well thought out. Since it appealed to a young(er) audience (& yes there was violence) but it taught overcoming adversity, fighting for what you believe in, and that doing the right thing is important (especially when you live forever) it spans all emotions: humor,love,sadness,tragedy and more, all of the things that make up LIFE. I highly recommend all of the series, start with the first and keep going til the end, it is better than any series on T.V. today.",1033689600,2,681,4.544715447154472
7957676,5,B000062TXS,"My second favorite sci-fi series of all time. The first movie is legendarily good in part because Queen did the soundtrack and everything they touch tends to sparkle like gold. All these stories are endlessly fascinating and the extras on the discs add flavor with each immortals bio and sword description being included , reading these are almost as good as watching the episodes.
 Like any sci-fi its best not to think too much about the stories lest you start asking the screamingly obvious questions and lose the story 'magic'
 The only physicall beef I have is with one of the discs from season 6 , It had an error on it that prevented my dvd player as well as my dvd-rom from reading it . What made that suck even more is that it contained one of my favorite episodes where Richie pawns himself off as a millionaire playboy and captures the attention of an almost searingly lovely young mortal lady who takes 'liberties' with him... it was really pretty funny. Though that disc was bad out of the box its nothing I got worked up over as the whole series is full of great stories.
 Another thing thats awesome about this series are the guest stars with Joan Jett and Roger Daltry being the absolute best...absolute best ! but there are many others as well ....Xavier St. Cloud <--- LOVE that character! What a ruthless SOB ! :)
 Immortals are all portrayed as Apex Humans and the sheer variety of stories about them , their personal histories and lives is so cool that I really wonder why theres been no reboot.

 Highlander: Raven is also pretty cool mainly because Elizabeth Gracen SIZZLED in her role ! but the fight scenes were really toned down. She had a lithe , nimble , magnificent physique but shes no martial artist. Unfortunately that series crashed and burned before one season was completed , still , this is a great series",1521244800,,1841,4.580547112462006
