8428911,1,B004GOKBQY,"Highly disappointing. Loved the original, Apparently someone should have quit while they were ahead. Was not even long enough to qualify as a movie, It lasted about as long as your average sitcom, But was a lot less entertaining than one.  Also was put off by the plot of someone committing suicide behind an hiv diagnosis because it seemed pilfered. Saw a dvd a few years ago in which a man sat on his bed alone and swallowed a bullet after the same diagnosis upon cheating on his Christian wife.",1527552000,,497,4.522222222222222

8428915,3,B004GOKBQY,"I think I enjoyed 1 better. Even though it continue from the first one, it wasn't as exciting as it.",1357516800,,100,4.05
8428916,3,B004GOKBQY,I was truly looking forward to seeing the entire cast and how they moved forward. Though it showed 2 of the characters it didn't capture me they way part 1 did. It pays sometimes to leave a good thing alone and on this movie it was better to be left at one.,1306022400,,257,3.9615384615384617
8428917,5,B004GOKBQY,He Who Finds A Wife 2 Thou Shall Not Covet is a follow too He who Finds A Wife 2006. This time the movie follows the story of Misty and Jeff it's very interesting. I think the main lesson of the story is real know the person before you say I do. If you enjoy  Why Did I Get Married Too then is similiar in the drama and confessions.,1305590400,,332,3.8115942028985508
8428918,4,B004GOKBQY,"I first came to know of this indie faith based film while shopping for movies for The Women's Ministry Retreat at my church in Okalahoma. And I remembered watching the 1st film ""He Who Finds A Wife"", it was perfect for the topic of marriage at the retreat a few years ago. Well when I saw that this new film, Part 2 version I got it and watched it. It's good story and good acting all around, just like the first version.",1300147200,4,421,4.146341463414634
