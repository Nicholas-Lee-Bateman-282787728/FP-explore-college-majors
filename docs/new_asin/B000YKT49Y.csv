I don't say this often about dance exercise videos, but I hated this workout.  While the instructor was pleasant and cued well, the moves were boring, I didn't break a sweat, and everything moved at an incredibly slow speed.  If you are familiar with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-with-the-Stars-Latin-Cardio-Dance/dp/B001BNFR80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dance</a>, then this is similar to that DVD...only worse.

Contrary to what the case will tell you, this workout is divided into five sections: warm up, salsa, cha-cha/merengue, samba/salsa/cha-cha, and rumba/cool down.  The case incorrectly says that the workout is divided into six parts: warm up, salsa, cha-cha, merengue, samba, and rumba/cool down.  The case also incorrectly puts the workout at 55 minutes, when in actuality the entire DVD only comes to about 45 minutes.  However, I'll stop talking about the case's inconsistencies and start talking about the workout.  Another reviewer (Touch Remedy) has already done a fantastic job of breaking down each section, so I won't focus too much on the steps.

Warm Up - This is the same as in the sister Latin and Retro DVD.  Cal Pozo (the producer) leads a short, slow, boring warm up, teaching some incredibly slow basic steps supposedly to get your body moving.  You'll get a better warm up by brushing your teeth.

Salsa - None of the workouts are actually routines; they are just several small combos that you'll do a few times before moving onto the next combo.  In Salsa, the combos are built on moves from the warm up.  Everything is VERY basic; someone who has never danced a step in their life could easily pick up the moves.  Unfortunately, Lisa Wheeler (the instructor) insists on slowing them way down several times before bringing them up to tempo.  My heart rate never got high.  The music was the same music used in Latin and Retro.

Cha-Cha/Merengue - The Cha-Cha moves wer admittedly a bit better, but the overall section still was immensely boring.  I quit the DVD in the middle of the cha-cha (although I watched the rest for review purposes).  All of the moves are again very basic; a beginner could easily do them.  Anyone except an EXTREME dance novice is going to be bored to tears.

Samba/Salsa/Cha-Cha - The moves get a bit more stylized in this section, but Lisa again breaks them WAY down and prevents the workout from actually being intense.  I tried to get back into the DVD at this point, but it was so easy it was boring.  Imagine having to do 1st grade math drills for 45 minutes; that is what this DVD felt like.

Rumba/Cool Down - This was the best part of the DVD.  The stretching was excellent, and there were a few Rumba moves thrown in for fun.

Bonus Salsa Partner Dance 101 - Honestly, practicing this was better than the actual workout.  Cal Pozo and his partner teach the viewers basic, authentic Salsa steps.  It's excellently taught, and I feel like I could actually take these moves to a club.

Overall, I highly discourage you from getting this DVD.  I gave it 2/5 stars only because I do realize that an extreme beginner just getting into fitness may want to start with this DVD to learn basic Latin moves that will be advanced upon in other DVDs.  However, looking at this workout as an intermediate/advanced exerciser, it's not something I will ever do again.  I do recommend looking into the Latin and Retro sister DVD, but definitely give this Dancefit a pass.",1334620800,2,3764,5.168595041322314
8233279,3,B000YKT49Y,"This is from Cal Pozo who has many dance instruction old-style & also produced many workout dvds over the years.
The production quality is professional. The music does drown out Lisa Wheeler a bit, I especially hard trouble with what the name of the dance steps were. The set is very sci-fi modern with a drummer in the back which makes no sense. There are 4 backup woman who can dance pretty well, they have good form overall, some dance some steps better then others & vice versa. I think one of the backups is Joby Brava (I couldn't find the credits on the dvd)
Warm-up: 7 min Cal Pozo w/4 backup women w/o Lisa shows you most of the steps in almost normal tempo, only slightly slower.
Salsa: 10 min
mambo, salsa, a sorta box step, a step out pose move, etc.
Cha-Cha: 10 min
cha-cha w/salsa steps, cuban hip rolls, etc.
Samba, Salsa, Cha-Cha: 10 min
hip figure 8s,Cumbia, Brigaton???? hip rolls, samba lunges, samba chest pumps, etc.
Cool Down/Rumba: 4 min
Lisa alone with small dance & real stretching for the first time on this dvd

Bonus: 7 min
Cal Pozo & partner showing how to dance salsa with partner showing basic steps, under arm turn, cross step lead. They teach both guy & girl & the music they dance to when showing full tempo dancing demo is much better then the music from the workout. This is one of the least boring dance instructions I've seen.

Pros:
Good dance form from the dancers
Almost perfect production quality
A lot of good practice of steps before moving on
Cons:
Lack of detailed teaching, it could use a separate section for teaching like Zumba does
Lack of enthusiasm or heart from the dancers, seemed more a chore almost
Music is almsot disco, lacks a beat, almsot elevator style
Dance never goes to full fast Latin tempo, almost slow, you don't get get hot or break a sweat.

This is best for beginners looking for easy workout & who can learn dance moves w/limited teaching. The idea is great, but because of the cons it's not going to get it's target audience.
