4387215,5,B004IO0QYY,"This collection of wordworld is perfect and best of all are pull apart animals soft and cuddly made of leters.
It is just amazing how quickly my baby learned letter recognition and puting words together in order thanks to these animals.
The whole family was amazed how those little hands could put togehter the dog, cat, zebra, cow, etc.. all animals in the set
together in a snap.

We started with the dog as it is her faforite animal, obviously - like most kids :) and then we gradually were adding on
animals untill we ended up with the whole set before we knew it. It is so rewording to see your tinny treasure to
be able to do words!!! that it is jsut breath taking.

We did not need any foring techinques, flash cards or anything, she was just grasping the concept from my taking apart
the animal, sounding the letters and puting them together back for her few times and then she got it like
in the same day and from that day on she knew.

I think this should be every paretnt's every baby first educational toy. It is so baby friendly, perfect for the sens of touch,
soft and cozy - what actually is said to develop brain faster.
It is sucha pleasing design and there are places to chew on if you need ha ha ha..
We take the animals everyhwere we go and she does not only have fun she is reinforcing her reading skills and preparing
for future writing without knowing it!

We were lucky to get the animals that were issued in those white boxed packaging with DVD inside. Not the other version in
the orangy cheaper packaging and without DVD. Difference is really apparent. I got the animals as a gift to my niece
but I could not find anywhere the first edition in white packaging with bluish background and DVd included in the box
so Igot the other set on e by and apparently they are not the same. Similar and all but the quality is not the same.
The original edition animals are more plumpy, solid, and have better and more baby friendly feel and touch to them
whereas the other - not the white box- edition has cheaper feel to it.

Overall we are very very pleased with the set. I have heard that this design got so many rewards and it is so popular among parents
and I totally agree with the notion. It is great for the baby and it teaches something useful for life unlike so many toys
that do nothing. It is good to see your baby having so much fun and stay engaged for good while with them.
It is amazing how long attention span the baby has while playing with the animals.

As she grows I marvel how she can put together the simple words from different animals for fun.. as in she would take
different letters from different animals and still spell the word dog or cat or cow correctly and giggles
that each letters is from different animal.. like for instance she will take L from the lion with the head,
then put i from the fish and then o from the dog and n from the lion again and she is so proud to do that.
It shows me that she is not only putting animal together, she is actually aware of the letters..
and to prove it she can take just the letters without heads and not color coded and at random
pull the letters and put together a word that is independent of characters..

soooooo cooooooooool

I am shopping for the original set now to get it for Christmas for two beloved babies in the family
and they are so hard to find, yet I won't stop till I find them. This is THE gift of learning and
I wont' settle for less :)",1324080000,,3442,4.228310502283105
4387216,5,B004IO0QYY,"What is there to say?  My grandson is a huge Word World and train fan and this movie combines the two; what is there not to love?  He has watched it repeatedly, along with many other Word World episodes. This show is very educational and has really fostered a love of letters, words, spelling etc. in my grandson.  He is now in Pre-K and is getting ready to read and I believe that watching this particular cartoon has been helpful in his reading readiness.",1320192000,,457,4.416666666666667
4387217,5,B004IO0QYY,My son is 22 months and LOVES Word World. He is learning his alphabet and these videos go a long way to help him grasp his letters. Plus he can really follow the stories and loves all the animals. Pig and dog are his favorites. And I like seeing how the words come together to build a word. Can't say enough good things. Train Escapade offers four great episodes with wonderful lessons - this sets the bar for educational programming.,1313798400,3,434,4.4375
4387218,5,B004IO0QYY,"My boys love WordWorld and what's great is that they are secretly learning their letters and to spell words!  This DVD is full of four episodes, the first one featuring a WordWorld train!  The other three episodes deal with hiccups, sneezing, and eating soup when your sick.  Those three episodes are perfect for right now because we have all been sick with something and my boys understood them!  The episodes are short, with the entire DVD only lasting an hour.  It is a great DVD for anytime and anywhere!

Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this dvd to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1304899200,11,599,4.60377358490566
4387219,2,B004IO0QYY,I was very disappointed because I was expecting it to be so much better. It did not capture our interest. The advertisement for it made it out to b so much more than what it really was. We definitely won't be purchasing any more of that show in the near future.,1417910400,,261,4.137254901960785

4387229,5,B004IO0QYY,"My grandson loves trains. He is a little young to understand that the characters have words to makeup their bodies, but he will learn this later. This is a great ideal to help kids learn to spell and the moral of the story.",1405296000,,223,4.209302325581396

4387232,5,B004IO0QYY,See my reviews of the other Word World DVDs. The same applies here. This one is more interesting for my 4 yr old who is still in love with trains but my 7 yr old also enjoyed it. Great way for kids to literally SEE how letter sounds go together to form words (4 yr old) and can help kids with spelling skills (7 yr old).,1399593600,,320,3.8636363636363638
4387233,5,B004IO0QYY,"My 3 year old often requests this show, and it's one that has good educational value, unlike some of the things that are on tv for that age group.  He's actually learned quite a bit about letters and letter sounds and I think this has helped.  And the characters are cute, colorful, non-scary, and non-annoying to adults.  What else can you ask for?  Except maybe to get the song about ""you can never have too many oos"" out of your head.  :)",1395100800,,441,4.329268292682927

4387245,2,B004IO0QYY,"I have a now, 4 yr old, that I bought this for, who,  has everything "" train"", that  one can imagine. In fact, I'm pretty sure ""train!"" was his fist clear word. Based on the reviews 4 months ago, I thought this would measure up to other great train videos for kids. While I love, LOVE, word world and, would allow him to watch it all day (not that I do), this had only a very small section with ""roo"" that depicted anything about trains at all. I had hoped for something like the Mickey Mouse Express. It wasn't. In fact, if I gave it away? I'm certain he wouldn't even notice it was missing. For me, that speaks volumes, especially, when ""TV"" isn't part of our daily repertoire.",1340755200,4,679,4.255813953488372
4387246,4,B004IO0QYY,"Really really hate the advertising for Dr Seuss, Pocoya, and other stuff when you drop in the DVD.  And I can't seem to bypass it on the Xbox player.

Luckily my kid doesn't recognize it and does not start screaming (at this age at least) for me to get so-and-so advertised product :)

Would normally give it a 5 but drop to 4.",1337212800,,327,4.158730158730159
4387247,5,B004IO0QYY,"This is an amazing series for a kiddo who loves word world. we have all dvds and
it took us time to collect them, this is great opportunity to save time and money.
The best way to encourage a child to learn is to buy the words world animals just
like the ones in dvd. I highly recommend the famous Word World pull apart plush plush soft animals to go with it.
The babies and kids love them so much. You can't get them anymore at stores
but if you are lucky you can come across the set on e bay.
It is worth all the money as it helps a child to learn so fast so early so much.
It is also amazing how much they sell for even used ones so it is good investment.
Well worth the price.",1325808000,,680,3.8297872340425534

The episodes are short and focus on a particular letter, sound or word family with enough repetition to learn the skill, but not be bored. The songs are fun and reinforce the episodes lesson.
