What is ""Toriko""?

In Japan, we have seen Shonen Jump series that have had a long life, not just as manga but as anime series. From the ""Dragon Ball"" series, ""One Piece"", ""Naruto"", ""Bleach"" and another series that has captivated readers and viewers is ""Toriko"".

Created by Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro in 2008, the manga series has been published on ""Weekly Shonen Jump"" and is currently on 22nd tankobon volume, while the anime series produced by Toei Animation is still being broadcast since 2011 on Fuji TV. And now the third part of the anime series will be released in the U.S. courtesy of FUNimation in March 2013.

The series is directed by Akifumi Zako (""Fresh Pretty Cure"", ""Ashita no Nadia"", ""Ojamajo Doremi Na-i-sho""), series composition by Isao Murayama (""Saint Seiya Omega"", ""Kaidan Restaurant""), music by Hiromi Mizutani (""Hell Girl"", ""Hyakko""), character designs by Hisashi Kagawa (""Bomberman Jetters"", ""Hataraki Man"", ""Fresh Pretty Cure"") and art direction by Masanobu Nomura (""Blue Drop"", ""The Big O"", ""K"", ""The Idolm@ster"", ""Gurren Lagann"").

It's important to note that in Japan, the first episode was a cross-over special with ""One Piece"". For the U.S. DVD release, this cross over episode is not included.

Toriko takes place during a time where gourmet is important. The taste, the texture of food and rare ingredients are what chefs seek for, but in order to get rare ingredients and animals, major organizations hire Bishokuya (which are ""gourmet hunters"").

The series begins with a chef named Komatsu who is dispatched by the International Gourmet Organization (IGO) to find Toriko in order to capture a rare animal known as a Gararagator (level 8). When Komatsu arrives, he sees the gourmet hunter easily catching a Pincer Fish. When Toriko finds out that Komatsu is trying to catch a Gararagator, Toriko who loves the challenge, agrees.

While Komatsu is timid and often scared of the creatures in the swamp and jungle, they come across a Gararagator, which is a gigantic red alligator and Toriko manages to kill it with his ""Fork and Knife"" technique but instead of giving the Gararagator to Komatsu for his organization, his intention to catching it was for a full-course menu. Wanting to become a world-renown chef, Komatsu feels that by being with Toriko, he can achieve that. So he asks if he can accompany Toriko on his adventures capturing animals for gourmet and Toriko accepts.

But as the two embark on their mission, they are challenged by a rival organization known as the Gourmet Corps who are bent on controlling the world's ingredients and wanting the two dead.

In part three of ""Toriko"", the group head out in the cold, frigid weather to look for Century Soup.  Hard to find and very dangerous, Toriko and friends are ready to find the soup...but also searching for the soup is the evil Gourmet Corps and Gourmet Yakuza.

Who will get to it first?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Toriko"" is an anime series that is full of detail for a TV series. Produced by Toei Animation, the animated series has a style of a classic old school anime series in terms of character design but what catches your eye is the detailed art backgrounds which are fantastic. Some scenes are in CG (such as water effects) but I really enjoyed the animation for this series.

As for audio, ""Toriko"" is presented in English 5.1 surround and in Japanese stereo. The English 5.1 soundtrack has better dynamic range when it comes to use of the surround channels but both are well-acted. For the English dub, both Ian Sinclair and Josh Grelle are both FUNimation veterans who are well-known for their voice work on series such as ""Black Butler"", ""Bird the Mighty"" and ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"".

For the Japanese soundtrack, you also get to hear veterans Romi Park (best known as Edward Elric for the ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" series and Toushiro Hitsugaya in ""Bleach"") as Komatsu and Ryotaro Okiayu (Katsuhiko Jinnai in ""El Hazard"", Scar on ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" and Kunimitsu Tezuka of ""Prince of Tennis"") and Park's delivery of the constant fear that Komatsu is often encountering is well-captured in her voice.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The most intense ""Toriko"" arc yet!

In the first 25 episodes of ""Toriko"", writers have used the episodes to introduce characters and also special abilities but to also how competitive things have been between the IGO and the Gourmet Corps.

Be episode 27, with the ""Century Soup"" arc, the action and fighting scenes have been increased considerably as Toriko and friends fight their greatest matchup yet.

The battle between Toriko vs. Tommyrod can be compared to epic battles such as Goku vs. Freezer (of ""Dragon Ball Z"") but not as drawn out in dozens of episodes.  In the case of ""Toriko"", the battle between the two show how far the two would go to win a battle and this includes the two prominent characters losing limbs.  Also, you have other characters involved in battle such as Takamaru vs. Bogie Woods and Match vs. Barrygamon going at the same time.  But if anything, grateful that these battles did not take nearly 20-episodes but half of that and we begin to learn that the rivalry between the IGO and Gourmet Corps is becoming more challenging, difficult and deadly.

There are more characters introduced in the ""Century Soup"" arc and the introduction of Teppei is pretty awesome as he not only heals, but he also fight!

While a more action-driven story arc, there is still quite a bit of humor and fun scenes included, especially as Komatsu tries to remake the Century Soup that he once tasted and seeing how things will develop for the next story arc involving the IGO taking part in the ""Gourmet King Championship"".

While I have read many manga and watched many drama that had centered around food, ""Toriko"" is rather interesting in the fact that these surprising ingredients tend to be exotic fruit guarded by monsters or some type of behemoth or animals that look like they come out of the Jurassic age.

So far with the first 38 episodes, the adventures are quite enjoyable as Toriko and Komatsu are on various adventures commissioned by the International Gourmet Organization to find an exotic item for a dish or some dangerous animal. Toriko like Kenshiro of ""Hokuto no Ken"" is gifted with tremendous fighting ability, while Komatsu is well... a good companion and a chef that wants to be the world best.

As for the DVD, the picture quality is pretty cool with the old school style of animation in combined with modern style of detailed art backgrounds and CG use. The series looks very good and it's a colorful anime series that doesn't look too soft. And for special features, you get three audio commentary from FUNimation English voice dub talent.

Overall, ""Toriko: Part Three"" is my favorite arc so far.  Action-packed, a lot of fun and exciting adventures that fans of action/adventure anime series will surely enjoy.  Recommended!",1364601600,4,7817,4.996141975308642
