8032490,1,B0002V9GNO,"This bootlegged DVD does not work. I tried it in 3 different DVD players and it says there is not ""playback feature"" on it. The cover looks like it was printed at someone's house on printer paper. Please refund my money immediately without wasting more of my time and having me send it back. This is the worst purchase I have ever made.",1388188800,,336,4.349206349206349
8032491,1,B0002V9GNO,"I purchased this DVD to help my son learn about DNA for his science project.  While it was pricey, I really wanted him to learn about DNA and this looked like it fit the bill.  While the DVD was very educational and well done, I was aghast that it was only 13 minutes!  I kept looking for another chapter on the menu - but no, it is 13 minutes for $59.95!!!  I should have read the product details more closely.  I liked the DVD, but the price is exorbitant!",1295395200,2,458,4.101123595505618
