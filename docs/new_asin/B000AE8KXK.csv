8078284,4,B000AE8KXK,"There have been several versions of World War II in which the combined Allied Power fought the Axis of Evil - Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan & Fascist Italy.

This series of war documentaries are perhaps the best ever filmed and would indeed be highly educational to kids and adults alike.

You will see rare combat footages in fighting the Nazis as well as the Japs over in Pacific.

Until the two American atomic bombs were dropped over Nagasaki and Hiroshima the Jap forces were prepared to fight to the last soldier or it seemed.

Then came the final, irrevocable and unconditional surrender of the Japs on board the USS Missouri which was presided over by General McArthur - The Supreme Allied Commander, thus ending the bloody Pacific War with the sad loss  of thousands of young American lives, ships and weapons.

However, the barbaric samurais were brought to their quacking  knees by the fighting American spirit...!

At this wonder price, the entire series are  the best bargain. So please go for it while stock last. Cheers!",1182988800,5,1034,4.829545454545454
