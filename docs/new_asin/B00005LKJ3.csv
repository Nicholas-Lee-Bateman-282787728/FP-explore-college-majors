7943917,5,B00005LKJ3,"Beautiful video..well produced, with several clips not seen before..Produced before her death, it is a definite addition to any Diana collector's video library..",1009497600,3,161,6.043478260869565
7943918,3,B00005LKJ3,"The video starts with some scenes from Diana's 1983 & 1996 trips to Austrailia then proceeds to go through  a short ( the whole video is only 49 minutes) history of her life, taking a mostly pro-Diana viewpoint. You'll have seen some of the footage before, but not all of it, and of four people interviewed I think only one was new to me. As the box description says the program was produced before her death, I think I saw 1996 in the program but 1998 and 2001 on the cover so the material has been around awhile. Dodi Fayed is shown twice on the box but he's not even mentioned in the program.",1008460800,8,595,4.219298245614035
