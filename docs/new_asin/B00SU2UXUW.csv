6992606,1,B00SU2UXUW,Don't waste your time. This is a total mess of non-logical story sequences decorated with cheap effects. Worst movie yet!,1432944000,2,121,5.1

6992608,5,B00SU2UXUW,I found none of the mentioned elements to any great degree in this movie.  It was a pretty good movie though with an interesting plot that was a tad disjointed.  Can't go into much detail without spoiling it but it worth watching.  Might have to watch it twice to get it though.,1432857600,2,278,4.3076923076923075
6992609,4,B00SU2UXUW,"Set in the early 18th century, the film stages a campy (and sometimes serious) showdown of science in the guise of an English cartographer versus the dark forces/folk superstition rampant in the mountain villages of Transylvania. Going into it after reading the teaser, I assumed this might be like Van Helsing, and as I enjoyed that filming style, I thought I'd do the rental. Glad I did so.

Forbidden Empire had a dark noire taste, and from the opening, suggested a Steampunk vibe with the science, gears and mapping instruments. That was a double win from my perspective, which was only enhanced by the Medieval-like Russian villagers and what felt like monster homage to ""The Army of Darkness."" All the actors did a fine job bringing their unique characters to life, the cinematography was eye-catching, and the CGI special effects were well done without overwhelming the story. The creature scenes, especially the one after the characters consumed that home brew, were a blast! Religion also had a role to play in this story, serving both as a counterpoint to the villagers' pagan superstitions and as a tool for power.

The language spoken was English with accents, and I had to pay attention to the various village characters, but it all worked. No subtitles were needed, and the writing kept twisting nicely as the movie progressed. What I initially took to be a vampire theme in the plot, pleasantly turned into another angle altogether. Though not a direct spoiler, I will say that I am reminded a bit of the fantastical Detective Dee movies set in ancient China and also Umberto Eco's ""The Name of the Rose."" But even then, the movie playfully maintains the intertwining of fantasy and science - both are deemed to exist - and the ending is nicely done.

Parental Guidance: No frontal nudity, but lots of sexual innuendo. The movie opens with our hero being caught in bed with his intended, and the after-effects of a woman being violated/killed (by a creature of the night or something just as evil, but perhaps more mundane) in the Transylvanian village. There are fights with swords, guns and other weapons producing wounds, gory/scary creature effects (that I loved), and a brief torture scene of a young male villager. Probably, it should be viewed as ""R"" rated, in the vein of ""The Army of Darkness,"" but with a more serious element involving human evil in places.

Overall, this is surprisingly entertaining fantasy film from Russian sources. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my Indie scale. Enjoy!",1432771200,45,2514,4.853146853146853

6992617,5,B00SU2UXUW,"This movie was fantastic, and it's sad to see how many people gave it so few stars. The REASONS that the over-dubbing sounds hokey, or the dialogue doesn't make perfect sense, or the fact that the way the story is told, the cinematography choices, the cuts, etc, ALL of it is because it is a Russian/Ukrainian folk tale made into a movie. It was filmed, and MADE over there. You don't watch a movie made in China, or Japan like martial arts movies, or a movie made in India that's ""Bollywood""-esq, and are upset when it's not 100% Americanized right? It's a foreign movie, based on a foreign folk tale that's been dubbed into English (and quiet well I might add). The complaints about the dubbing, broken English, and some of the dialogue not making sense is BECAUSE it has been translated, and when you translate things they can lose their meaning, and even CHANGE their meaning. It can lose the effect. Same as when a curse word is used here in an English speaking culture, but means nothing in another country right? Or when a common saying like ""don't count all your eggs before they hatch"" means pure gibberish in another language. So some ""lost in translation"" issues are BOUND to occur in ANY foreign made movie that's been dubbed into another language. You get it with almost every single martial arts movie, BUT in my opinion those ""translation issues"" are very far, and few between. It seems people were more upset with the fact that the words didn't match up with the actors mouths, and they let that small thing dampen the movie for them, which is sad. If you let it bother you you'll miss out on some truly amazing movies. Why are you fixated on the actor's mouths anyways? Haha! There's so much more going on in a movie that's 1.5 hours long, why are you just watching their mouths? Haha! Stop it! So a movie like ""Red Cliff"" (It's an absolutely STUNNING movie shot in China, and Mongolia, but it's been dubbed) , you can't let the very SMALL issues of dubbing/translation bother you, or you're stuck with having a cinema library that's only American/UK/Canadian films. You're missing out! Well, even the Canadian films can be dubbed from French haha.
Anyways, the acting was great, the cinematography was great, the music was great (and it had an Eastern European vibe to it). Even the CG was great. People MAY have been thrown by seeing an English actor whose first language is English playing the lead role, and watched the movie thinking it would be an Americanized, Hollywood movie, and were upset by THAT part of it. BUT, remember that Jason Flemyng actually speaks a few different languages fluently, including French, English, and Russian. You add his linguistic skills in with the fact that the directors most likely wanted a more well known western actor to be the lead (who had linguistic skills), which would help ""solidify"" the movie. If it was all Russian, and Ukrainian actors then us westerners would probably haven't of even glanced at this movie to give it a moments thought. The facts that Jason Flemyng is a well known western actor, and speaks multiple languages fluently is quiet frankly a bit of genius on the director's part for choosing him to play the lead. The only draw back is that there are some people who see him, and think it's going to be a movie that is filmed in a western style. This movie is more like the spaghetti westerns that were dubbed over, or even the martial arts movies from Asia. Think of it as how India does their movies, Russia/Ukraine has THEIR own way as well, and I think they did a great job in westernizing this folk tale into a film enough to get into my hands. I'm glad it made it out of Russia haha! It's like a Bollywood movie without any of the spontaneous dancing, and singing. It's like Van Helsing, but made with an Eastern European film crew, directors, and writers. Give it a chance, and leave your preconceived notions of what a movie is SUPPOSED to be like, because not all movies come from Hollywood, and not all cinema comes from America. They all have their own way of storytelling through film. If you can do that, and take everything into account then I honestly believe you'll enjoy this film.

6992622,1,B00SU2UXUW,"Although I like some of the actors in this movie, it was terribly disappointing.  Reading the movies title and description of the movie was the best part of my experience.  You expect a tale of fantasy and adventure and instead you get a story about a corrupt priest who has used the fears and superstitions of a small village to cover up a crime and seize power.  Not a bad plot in it's own rights but not what I paid for.

This movie is very similar to M Night Shyamalan's The Village.  The reason behind the deception is different but how the story is told, how revelations are made with no real build up, and the utter let down when you find that all is fake is very much the same.",1486771200,,685,4.198473282442748

6992640,5,B00SU2UXUW,Had this on my Watch List for a while... the preview was really intriguing... and finally broke down and bought/watched it.  It was good!  A much different pace than American movies. Fantastic surreal special effects. The director is very good... he's certainly a visionary in terms of designing his shots and his storytelling.  The movie is a RUSSIAN adaptation of a Russian fantasy/horror/adventure/religious story.  I think it was a book first.  Flemyng does a good job.  It started off like an almost steampunk Hammer Dracula movie... then turned into a religious horror movie.  Production design reminded me of the old POPEYE movie.  Give it a shot if you want to enjoy an esoteric movie with a bit more sophistication.  It's not too serious... and it's very fun.,1470873600,,768,4.984251968503937

6992643,3,B00SU2UXUW,"There's something odd about the tone set by this Russian fantasy film set in 1701 Europe.  From its very start it frantically darts from one story idea to another, this new character to the next, this scene to that, festooned with CGI effects and transitions that smack more of a videogame than a movie.  We are bombarded by this collage of scenery and characters, complete with romantic prophecy, mortal love, an inspired inventor and explorer, some sort of horned bog creature and all manner of magic in a matter of minutes.  This may strike you as something that sounds cool--but the film is not nearly as cool as the trailer.

The budget is clearly not high as indicated by the non-CGI set components, and CGI is routinely used to complement the scenery.  It resembled the effects of the ""clip scenes"" from some horror/fantasy videogame that had amazing effects a decade ago but seems to fall short in quality today.

This produces mixed feelings from this reviewer.  Whereas the CGI augments the sense of high fantasy, its quality leaves me fearful that this crutch may be employed to mask other shortcomings.  One such shortcoming was the atrocious English dubbing, which was more irresponsibly haphazard than that found in 1970s Kung Fu Theater.  Just terrible.

Our bold explorer Dzhonatan Grin (Jason Flemyng; Hanna, X-Men: First Class) sets out to make the most accurate maps the world has ever seen using his own cartography invention.  But like Gulliver or Baron von Munchausen, he has his share of misadventure.  He encounters witches, foolish drunk monks, superstitious villagers and zombie wolvesbut that's the ""normal"" stuff.  After he is commissioned to map the area surrounding a lord arrested to his land for fear of some curse, the locals take a particularly strong interest in Dzhonatan (dubbed Jonathan).

While the effects quality was mediocre, the scene featuring the girl's animated, almost hag-like possessed corpse and the animated prehensile roots was pretty cool.  It made for a long action sequence.  Likewise, the mass transformation scene at the dinner table was the coolest scene of the film.

As if magically fueled by the darkest of witchcraft, the men transform into demonic creatures and their entre pirogues hatch stillborn monstrous yet diminutive fetuses into a swarm of tiny winged imps.  The demons are pretty awesome, but the scene itself comes out of nowhere and would benefit from a larger budget.  Enjoyable nonetheless!  I particularly enjoyed seeing the perversions of their now vestigial, modified or recently detached body parts.

Then there's the creature with the crazy eyelids and the compound eyes.  As if born from the mind of Guillermo del Toro, the monsters were clearly the highlight of this film.

Unfortunately, the scenes between the special effects pelted us with fragmented story components and, again, the destitute dubbing only made things worse since there was a lot of story to tell.  Not even the occasional scene with Charles Dance (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) could save this film.

An Amazon reviewer (brad1110c, to give credit) called this a ""hot mess of almostOR an interesting jumble of potential.""  That's probably a perfect assessment of these neat ideas packed into a woeful film.  The neat steam punk story, fantasy theme and Transylvania setting would benefit from a Netflix series treatment, in my opinion.  If you've seen (and probably fallen in love with) the trailer, I probably cannot dissuade you from seeing this or waiting until it can be viewed for free.  Just be warned that expectations should be set low.  VERY LOW.",1466899200,,3611,5.081494057724957

There seem to be a lot of complaints about the English language overdub, but I did not find it to be problematic or distracting.  To me, this movie sort of turned out have Van Helsing and other films of that ilk should have but didn't, mainly because it lends a Slavic/eastern European folklore to the proceedings that you just wouldn't get from a Western-produced film.  The story here is coherent, makes sense, and even has a solid twist at the end which leaves the final act of the film moving in a different direction that I would have expected.

The outer tale of an English cartographer setting out to map the world so he can get money to marry his sweetheart doesn't go anywhere and the inner story of a Ukrainian village plagued by...what?...doesn't really have that little zing needed to make it lively enough. Most of what the villagers do is run around trying to kill each other for a stolen bag of gold while the local priest urges them to kill any outsiders while the cartographer seems merely there for comic fish-out-of-water effect. Even when he was in a scene with the other actors, it just didn't gibe. The English actors spoke English and the rest didn't, so there was a great deal of dubbing. In some cases, this was well-coordinated, in most, the voices didn't fit the actors.

6992689,1,B00SU2UXUW,"The only reason that I gave this abortion of a movie one star is because there is not a lower rating. To call this dreck a film might lead the reader to believe that there is some value to watching this ""movie."" My greatest regret, besides actually paying good money for this hot mess, is that I wasted almost two hours of my time watching it, time that I can never get back.

This movie has a very disjointed story line that never fully matures, much like it's characters. It is pretty obvious that this film was not produced in English. I do not know exactly what language the actors were speaking in, but listening to the dialog and watching the characters lips move harkened back to the old martial arts films where the actor would speak two words but the dialog would continue after the character had finished speaking.  It was either that or the character would deliver a long speech but the dialog ended well before the character finished speaking.

The acting, if you could call it acting, was way over the top. The styles fell somewhere between Elizabethan stage performing Sam's School of Acting and Vehicle Maintenance. The actors chewed up the scenery so bad that it led me to believe that no one had eaten a meal throughout the entire production of the film.

The flashback & memory scenes were pretty bad and often failed to relate to the scene immediately before or immediately after the flashback/memory scene.

The only saving grace, if there was one, is the special effects. Unfortunately, the producer, director and editor must not have learned form film history that a movie cannot stand on FX alone and still be a good film.

To sum it all up, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!!! However, if you disregard my warning and still buy this movie I recommend that, after you watch it, give it as a Christmas or Birthday gift to someone you can't stand. Not only will you be doing yourself a favor by no longer owning it, but you'll pretty much ruin movie night for whoever you give this to.",1440288000,,1994,4.540389972144847

Caught in a compromising position, he leaves London and maps Europe with his wanderings taking him to a small superstitious village haunted by a 7 horned Viy creature and who knows what else. Here he learns their secrets and is drawn into their issues.

The production might be a horror fantasy for tweens. The cinematography was decent and the plot interesting as the film makers did everything they could to make it dull. The dialogue lacked zip. It needed to drop clues. The soundtrack needed to be some of that black Russian folk death metal or whatever they classify it. What was with the bad Mohawk comb overs? Did they really wear their hair that way?  I did like the CG special effects.

6992724,5,B00SU2UXUW,"Forbidden Empire appears to be an English language release of the Russian film Viy the Return.  Therefore, I am submitting the same review that I made for Viy the Return in order to give the reader some useful information:

This movie, Viy Vozvrashchenie or Viy the Return (2010), is not a remake of Viy or the Spirit of Evil (1967). It is rather a sequel to the original movie, and, if I'm not mistaken, incorporates some of the footage from the original film.

The 1967 Viy is an excellent film and faithfully captures the original story from Nikolai Gogol's Mirgorod Collection. Although I am also a fan of Mario Bava's Black Sunday in all its versions, Bava's film departs significantly from Gogol.

The new movie, Viy the Return, also departs from Gogol, but consciously works to provide the viewer with an alternative explanation for the supernatural goings on. As such, it builds upon the original 1967 movie, which is why I strongly recommend that you first purchase and watch the 1967 Viy on RUSCICO DVD. Then watch Viy the Return. I will not give out any spoilers. Watch both movies.

Unfortunately, the Blu Disc/3D release of Viy the Return, which is still available, does not provide either English subtitles or an English voice-over. This is a significant problem for a person whose familiarity with the Russian language is sadly lacking. On the other hand, the DVD release of Viy the Return does have English subtitles. But the DVD seems to have become unavailable at present. Fortunately, you will not have to worry about these problems with the 1967 Viy on RUSCICO.

For those of you interested in soundtrack music, Viy the Return by Anton Garcia is available on a limited edition CD from Kronos Records KRONCD056.

UPDATE: It appears that Viy the Return will be released on June 30, 2015 in DVD format under the title Forbidden Empire. I'm unclear whether this new release will be 127 minutes long or 111 minutes.  However, it appears to be an English language release.

Interestingly enough, there are already a great many reviews on line in Amazon, ranging from those who enjoy the movie to those who deplore it. I will defer further comment until I see the Forbidden Empire version, except to say that I hope that a little knowledge of the background of the story may ameliorate some of the harsher criticism.",1435104000,,2329,4.788029925187033

So, while the set design and special effects were pretty cool and fairy-tale like, the dubbing drove me nuts and made the mediocre acting even worse. I feel bad for the writer because this story had potential. I got about 30 minutes in and that was with 2 fast forwards to check if the dubbing was through the whole movie.

It appears to me that the Forbidden Empire Trailer was cleverly produced to intentionally hide the experience of sitting through a horribly dubbed movie.  After making it through to the end (which is an incredibly daunting task), I re-watched the Trailer..., curious if I had missed something..., re-read the movie description from Amazon (but clearly did not read the reviews, and definitely should have).  I was looking for the official listing of the language spoken in the movie.  Nowhere to be found. The only hint was that Amazon lists the movie ""Captions"" as English.  I guess that was a clue.

I purchased this movie because one of my favorite actors had a starring role.  Jason Flemyng immediately brings ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels"" to mind.  I knew this was off the beaten path from a Guy Ritchie look and feel, but Jason Flemyng should take a mulligan for this one, and pretend it never happened and does not exist.

There is clearly English spoken by at least two of the characters..., maybe three.  However, that accounts for very little of the movie.  The horrid attempt to dub the movie with an English track (primary language spoken is Russian) combined with special effects that can occasionally be good, but has more than its fair share of early-day special effects, make for a very poor experience.",1434412800,2,1440,4.813008130081301

The flash backs home to England do nothing to further the story, they just add another storyline to juggle, and actually make the hero less sympathetic. The narrative is so muddled that I was still hoping something would tie things together and make some point of it up until the last 20 minutes of the film (when they finally do attempt to tie all the randomness together).

Beards were extensively used to cover the lips, to prevent viewers of the film from seeing their lips moving (for the redubbing).  It was horrendous.  The characterizations were cardboard and stiff, and the voices used for the redubbing sounded like something out of a children's audio book on a scratchy cassette tape.  One other noticeable outcome with the redubbing was the elimination of ambient sound.

This movie is NOT worth your money.  I wish I hadn't spent it.",1433721600,3,629,5.107843137254902
6992763,1,B00SU2UXUW,I couldn't finish watching it seemed like they couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a drama,1433721600,,92,4.166666666666667
6992764,1,B00SU2UXUW,"Couldn't make it through this one.
There was no real plot.
What story there was jumped all over the place.
The special effect were about the only semi interesting thing in it.
Note: it is possible that things got lost in translation but I doubt it.
Yes, it is dubbed, at least it seemed like it.
If not, the video and dialogue were off sync.

Suggestion:
If you have a choice of hitting your thumb with a hammer or this, it would be a hard choice.
This is the kind of movie that makes you feel dumber for watching.",1433721600,6,514,4.191919191919192
6992765,4,B00SU2UXUW,"A very fun telling of a complete mashup tale.  Ukrainian folklore meets English traveler. Very poorly edited; some of the jumps will be stomach-churning or confusing for American audiences.  However, the SFX were innovative and pretty good, the story was very good, and if you take it as a dubbed foreign fantasy tale, it's a pretty fun movie to watch.",1433635200,,352,4.85

6992767,3,B00SU2UXUW,"First, this is not a badly made movie. It has a fun, rolling story-line...when you can follow it. That seems to be the biggest problem with this film. Not the fact that it's pretty poorly dubbed, or the fact that some of it didn't really translate all that well. The story-telling is so disjointed and the events so inexplicable at times, that you're left asking if parts of the film were left out of the final cut. The novelty of the film style saves it. If you like horror and adventure and don't mind a dubbed film, wait to rent this when it's affordable and you probably won't be disappointed. Just keep your expectations low and be prepared for some head-scratching from time to time and you'll find it at least marginally entertaining.",1433548800,2,741,4.578947368421052
6992768,1,B00SU2UXUW,Weird and awful. I like weird movies but this one was not entertaining to me. The trailer was nothing like the movie.,1433462400,,117,4.363636363636363
6992769,1,B00SU2UXUW,"The dubbing is horrible in this movie - and nowhere is it even indicated in the film's description that it's dubbed.  I guess I should've assumed an Eastern European genesis to the film when I saw the director's name, and thus the studio's need to dub, but no bells went off since the trailer itself was captivating (my bad).  Sadly, even the (admittedly peripheral) presence of Charles Dance couldn't save it.  I got 15 minutes in and had to stop watching.",1433462400,2,457,4.617283950617284
6992770,4,B00SU2UXUW,"When younger I found a huge lack of fantasy and started reading Russian fairy tales. I found the same aura in this movie, long winded but entertaining. It was actually quite inventive while trying to give the aura of a classic. It is definitely not going to entertain those who are not into this type of genre. My first Russian fairy tale was about a young man who tricked the emperor into a cauldron of milk and of course was boiled to death . Magic is definitely in their blood, and yes , the stories are long lol. I enjoyed it because I will follow a story faithfully. I was impressed with the cgi and the dark nature of the film.",1433376000,7,633,4.239669421487603
6992771,2,B00SU2UXUW,"Pretty lame. A great story line, some cool effects had a lot of potential but the Directing was disjointed confusing, and was this movie dubbed? Maybe if it was in the original language with some decent subtitles it might of been better. Or it had a terrible sound man.",1433289600,5,269,4.510204081632653

6992774,4,B00SU2UXUW,"I am amazed that this movie has not received higher ratings... Sad to think, but I wonder if the current young generation isn't just burned out on blockbuster entertainment and has little appreciation for something off the beaten path. If you are like me and dig more exotic and twisted ingredients in your palate, then try this witchy broth of a stew. I grew up in the 70's, and there were a lot of odd  foreign films being dubbed and shown as matinees to children. This movie reminded me of those happy, politically incorrect times when it seemed the whole point was to give you nightmares. Yes there is an abundance of CGI in this , but it is masked inventively and maintains a retro vibe. This movie was everything that looked promising in the trailer and more. Only those with a ""seen it all"" attitude will turn a blind eye to this curiosity. Give it a whirl and I hope you enjoy this fairy tale for ""grownups""...",1433116800,4,918,4.464285714285714
6992775,4,B00SU2UXUW,"Dubbed - in fact I think this was originally a Russian movie and that the Flemyng and Dance bits were inserted afterward for English distro. Amazon is negligent in not warning potential renters.

It really doesn't matter - this movie looks GREAT, with deep intense colors. It looks Eastern European, the characters look very Russian, everything looks spooky and old. If you want something along the lines of Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"", but definitely not supernatural, try this one.",1433116800,2,486,5.151898734177215
6992776,3,B00SU2UXUW,"Honestly, It's hard to know where to start, I feel like someone in Eastern Europe had a pile of cash and wanted to make a movie grounded in Slavic folklore. So they could afford some name recognition with a couple of the actors(ironically two that I like). There's such a mix of things going on it's like blending some Brother's Grimm, Van Helsing, and some of Sam Rami's ""Evil Dead"" along with crappy dubbing akin to Russian Kung Fu Theatre. All in all, I really wanted to like this but it just missed it's mark. You could certainly do worse, and if this is an early attempt I think there's great potential down the road.************ I was torn between two and three stars",1433116800,17,673,4.479674796747967
6992777,5,B00SU2UXUW,"This movie is a mishmash of genres, and a little on the cheesy side (though it seems perfectly aware of the fact), but it powers through each cheesy moment with nonstop brazen awesomeness.

8699273,3,B00SU2UXUW,"This movie was dubbed.
Wish a subtitled version existed!!!
I hate dubbed.
Dropping one star for the dubbing.
Otherwise great, fun, atmospheric movie.

Excellent followup for the original Viy (Soviet, 1967 - find on YouTube / read the book by Gogol, 1835)
Confused why translators and synopsis say its Transylvania.
This is set in Ukraine.

A British scientist mapping the world finds himself in a haunted Cossack village where he is dragged into local politics.
Trippy (Lovecraftian) hilarity ensues.
...well - not really comedy - but a campy horror with comeuppances for all",1523318400,,575,5.172043010752688

8699277,3,B00SU2UXUW,"I don't know what to make of this.  It's a fairly interesting story about eeee-vil happenings in a remote Russian village.  The general tone is pretty serious and gritty and muddy; but then there's this traveling English cartographer who is treated whimsically.  The tonal contrast doesn't work, and there were little logical problems that I was unwilling to suspend disbelief for:  How do you steer a carriage when you can't see out of it?  How much vodka can you drink before you die?  More importantly, were the fantastic happenings in the church intended to be real or just an hallucination?  ...and lastly, that's not how carrier pigeons work.",1519344000,,648,4.944444444444445
