2655843,4,B000IHY9UC,"I just bought this dvd and hoped it would prove better than Denise's ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"".  I really like her ""Ultimate Fat Burner"" as a cardio workout and hoped this one would be just as good.  It is better than the first I mentioned but has some of the same lack of intensity such as just when you start to feel an exercise she quits when a few more reps would give better results.  She has some different exercises in here that I found refreshing, just not quite as many reps as there should have been for someone more advanced.  The cardio is good, getting the heart rate up. Once you watch the video a few times you'll know what is coming next so the miscues and sudden switcharoos are something that doesn't bother me.  I like the way she gets right into both workouts without endless stretching before getting serious.  You still get warmed up before the more strenuous part, just get there quicker, something important for those of us on a tight time schedule.  It's also great to know I can get a good cardio workout in 20 minutes for those days when I'm really short on time.  This definitly has a place in your exercise library, just could have been a bit better for the more advanced by increasing reps.",1168473600,14,1225,4.413333333333333
2655844,5,B000IHY9UC,"I own a lot of Denise's exercise videos and dvds. I've tried others but can't follow them. I like hers because I can follow what is happening. yes, she does mis-cue but once you get used to it, it's not a problem. This workout is very intense in a good way. It's challenging and I will definately stick to it. I like that it has work with weights included. I highly recommend it.",1168128000,5,379,4.205479452054795
2655845,5,B000IHY9UC,This Boot Camp DVD from Denise Austin is for intermediate to advanced level. I already have a couple of her DVD's for quit some time so it was not a problem for me to follow her. I would not suggest that DVD if you are a beginner or did not try a previous workouts. For some people she talks but I think she is motivating. I already have a lot of workout DVD's and this is my second favorite workout DVD!

2655846,4,B000IHY9UC,"I have to say I've been doing videos by Denise for years now.  This video, I'm happy to say, caters to the intermediate to advanced levels.

Of couse anyone that does Denise's videos knows she's not the best at queuing.  But you cannot deny she knows her stuff.  And once you get used to the video, you know when to switch exercises anyways.  I especially like the fact that there is a flexibility/cool down portion that lasts for ten minutes.  Alot of the videos coming out don't have long enough cool down portions.  And it is so important to stretch after an exerting workout.",1167177600,,579,4.509615384615385
2655847,2,B000IHY9UC,"this is the worst denise austin dvd to date.  she truly acts like a confused overexhuberant cheerleeder.  i have always been able to tune her out in the past but her lack of instruction makes it impossible.  sometimes she tells you, sometimes she doesn't. both of the workouts on this leave a lot to be desired. as does the stretch.  not sure this would be recommended for beginners as she bounces from one move to the other without warning and haphazardly, but experienced would be bored with this very quickly. and just a quick remark, when you think of boot camp what do you think of???? um duh!!! lots of running, jumping jacks... high impact moves. that and absolutely no where on the dvd does it say low impact.  try the personal training system using the low intensity aerobics section.",1167091200,9,793,4.635714285714286
2655848,2,B000IHY9UC,"The workout could be good if she would only cue correctly, sometimes she looks lost. This is not good for beginners as it's too hard to follow.

2655849,4,B000IHY9UC,"I have a ton of fitness videos, and picked this one up on a whim.  I am SO glad I did!  I was surprised at how efficient the entire program was.. it was fast moving, but I felt like my entire body was worked, and worked well.  I almost gave up on Denise after her Burn Fat Fast video, which was frustrating in that it didn't provide a high intensity workout.

I completed the entire program tonight, and it was FUN and not in a dancy, breezy way - but in a way that moved along without getting boring.

Beginners will definitely get frustrated with this because it IS Denise, and her cueing is atrocious.. BUT if you exercise often, and are familar with a variety of moves you will catch on quickly. I highly recommend this dvd for exercisers wanting to throw in some great variety (which there is a TON in this video) I am now a happy (boot)camper!",1166054400,157,849,4.248447204968944

2655981,4,B000IHY9UC,"I am a big Denise Austin fan, so for the workout and for her enthusiastic encouragement and personality in general I give the video five stars.  Because of the video quality, however, which is not HD - and in full-screen mode parts of it are a little out of focus - I have to take away a star.

This video is made up of two 20-minute workouts and a ten minute stretching session.  The cardio sessions are classic Denise Austin style, and very acceptable for beginners or intermediates.  If you have problems with your knees (as I do), you might be dismayed at the amount of lunges and kickboxing moves, especially in the first workout.  But I managed to modify the moves so my knees didn't hurt too much.

The first cardio workout uses no extra equipment other than a mat for ab work and stretching at the end.  The second workout has a cardio session as well as a dumbbell session.  Denise calls the third workout a ""flexibility session,"" and it begins with seated stretching and moves on to isolated exercises which are slow and mostly performed lying down or seated.

You could choose to do the video from beginning to end and get 40 minutes of cardio and a ten minute stretching cool-down, or you could even start with the stretching segment as a warm-up and continue on to one or both of the cardio workouts.

Overall a very good video at a good price.",1409875200,6,1357,4.4574898785425106

2656012,3,B000IHY9UC,"Going into using this DVD, I was familiar with Denise Austin's personality, voice, etc.  So I am not going to add or subtract stars from my rating based on that -- I knew what I was getting.  For people who might not be familiar with her, I will discuss it a bit.  Her style is very off-putting to some people.  Her voice is raspy and she talks nonstop.  However, I do believe she knows a lot about fitness, and she demonstrates knowledge of anatomical terms.

One aspect of this DVD does deserve mention, though, before I move on to talk about the individual segments: there's almost no discussion of proper form for any of the moves.  Early on in the cardio segment, Denise, herself, has rather bad form for push-ups and plank.  Some sections (I'm thinking about the lunges from the strength portion) are also a bit too fast to maintain proper form throughout.  If you're intermediate or advanced, when it comes to exercise, this might not be a big deal.  There aren't a lot of new moves here, so if you've done squats in another DVD or video, you've probably heard not to let your knees get out too far (i.e., over your toes).  But if you're a beginner, you could have problems with form and/or pacing.

The DVD is divided into three segments, a 20-minute cardio segment, a 20-minute strength segment, and a 10-minute flexibility segment.

Cardio: The warm-up here is decent and covers all the major muscle groups, though it takes about 1/4 of the workout time.  This is supposed to be an interval-training workout, but the intervals are not significantly more difficult (in my opinion) than the other segments.  The actual interval work, after the warm-up, only goes on for about 11 minutes; this seems too short to me to be effective.  Then there's an abs section, and it's short but not bad.  It does cover all the major ab muscles, including upper, lower, and oblique.

Strength: There's not much of a warm-up here (maybe two minutes).  I find there's a little too much reliance on squats in this section.  One thing I do like is that there are several different combination moves that simultaneously work the upper and lower body.  This section also includes an abs workout, but this has different exercises than the cardio section does.  Please note that in the description for this section (accessed from one of the menus), it says to use 3-5 lb weights.  This might work for beginners, but is simply not going to do it for more advanced exercisers.

Flexibility: I actually really like this segment.  There's a little movement instead of just holding yourself static.  The main part covers ""active isolated stretches"" of different muscles.  This consists of short holds and releases of a stretch before holding it for a longer period of time.

Other notes:

*The music is highly annoying and sounds as if it's on some sort of endless loop.  The camera work was decent.

*Denise has a tendency to say things like ""target tone the tummy.""  Everything I've read suggests that spot-toning specific areas is not possible.  Sure, you can build ab muscles by doing crunches.  But if you want to have a smaller stomach, you need to lose weight all over.  Denise may very well know the difference (in fact, it's likely she does), but she doesn't express it very clearly in this DVD.

*The other participants are young and fit and, for the most part, seem happy to be there.  However, one of the men (the one on the back right with the fake tan) sometimes has a bit of trouble following along when the moves change.

*There isn't a lot of cueing here.  It's needed less in this type of routine, where there aren't combinations (like there were in, say, a really old step video of Denise's that I have).  But it might benefit beginners to watch it first and get an idea of what's going on.  Sometimes I found myself half a step behind, and I consider myself advanced.

*I don't find this much of a challenge, difficulty-wise.  It's medium-intensity when the whole thing is done in a single session.

It seems clear to me that Denise intended this to be a single 50-minute workout, not two complete 20-minute workouts with a bonus flexibility segment.  (It seems to have been the trendy thing to do, back when this was produced, to call separate segments complete ""workouts"" when they really weren't.  I can say the same thing about other multi-""workout"" DVDs that I own from 6-7 years ago.)  The length of the warm-up in the first segment is great for a 50-minute DVD, as is the length of the stretch.  There's not a cool down worth noting in either of the 20-minute segments.  The cardio segment isn't intense enough to be a workout on its own (in my opinion), unless you're just starting out with exercise.  However, if you're a beginner, you might not know everything you need to about form, and as discussed above, you won't get an introduction to proper form in this DVD.

In the end, I have really mixed feelings about this DVD.  I like some parts of it quite a bit and think others could use some work.  This would be best for people who are familiar with Denise and looking to challenge themselves a little more than in some of her other DVDs.",1379894400,5,5151,4.615638766519824

2656016,3,B000IHY9UC,"I have nearly every Denise Austin video and really like most of them. However, this video has three main flaws.  Each 20 minute workout is meant to be done alone.  They do not work well when doing both.  Why?  This leads me to the second flaw.  She goes to the floor immediately after high cardio on both videos and does floor work typically done at end of a workout.  Third flaw:  She should call it buns workout because almost every exercise works this area.  Way too many squats!!
On a positive note, you do work up a sweat and the added stretch/flexibility sequence is excellent and great addition to any workout.

Some poor editing, but it's a quick workout with the option to extend to half an hour or 50 minutes.

2656042,5,B000IHY9UC,"As a caveat; I am not a fitness expert or instructor.  That said, I thought this was a good workout, particularly if you're a Prime member & able to view it for free.

I would categorize this as moderate intensity.  It can be split into sections, but when played using Instant Video, it runs straight through at around 55 minutes.  There are sections for warmup, abdominal exercise, boot camp (starts at 21 minutes if you want to jump straight to it) & stretching.

I would recommend this to people who exercise occasionally but aren't in great shape, who would like to get their blood pumping & work up a sweat.  You need to be fairly mobile. It utilizes some brief yoga, pilates, stretching, & tae bo style fighting with the air.  Also, it is preferable to have small (not bulky) barbells available, probably between 2-10 lbs (2 of them) for about a 10 minute portion of the boot camp.

I would NOT recommend this if you are:
1) Hoping for an intense P90x or Insanity style workout
2) Just wanting to dance (get the one that rhymes with ""roomba"")
3) Experiencing lots of back or joint issues (quite a bit of up & down & core muscle activity that could cause further irritation).
4) Desiring a slow/gradual workout.  This one isn't real fast, but does require some coordination & timing.
5) Addicted to pushups (I like that this only has a few, unlike some videos that are basically variations on the push-up).
6) Wanting to bulk up (the heaviest thing you lift is yourself (when doing squats/knee bends)).

Doing this video daily would certainly result in an improvement in conditioning.  I believe most people would gain a little muscle & lose some fat, which may be accompanied by weight loss.  It feels great at the end to have stretched, sweated, & worked the major muscle groups.  I'll probably jump straight to the boot camp when I only have 30 minutes to workout.

2656047,1,B000IHY9UC,I am no beginner to workouts but the exercise moves are way too fast and can cause injury. Proven by how fast Denise must talk to keep up with herself. I tossed it in the trash!,1350950400,3,177,3.9444444444444446
2656048,1,B000IHY9UC,First of all Denise Austin is way too peppy for me at 4:45am. I could not get past the first five minutes. Not to say that I don't want someone with energy but she is a little too much for me. I would sell it back but it's not worth that much.,1347062400,2,243,3.6923076923076925
2656082,2,B000IHY9UC,"I consider myself advanced when it comes to fitness. Although, I do like Denise Austin, this workout is no different from the others I have purchased or rented.

2656083,3,B000IHY9UC,If you have one of her videos you have them all. The first four exercises are the ones in the Fat Burning Blast video. She still cannot cue you into the next move which is not a big deal since you do a workout video over and over. She gives you a good workout it is just not great! If you want a great workout purchase The Firm workouts.,1331510400,4,337,3.898550724637681

2656085,2,B000IHY9UC,"I don't care for this workout. I find Denise's cuing inadequate, her stagey personality annoying, and the workout poorly paced. There is no attention to form so it would be a terrible tape for beginners. Experienced exercisers will handle the rapid transitions because they already know proper form. Others will strain to follow along.",1321488000,,335,5.222222222222222

I always think...Oh Denise Austin, this is going to be so easy...well this isn't what I would call easy.  In fact it left me breathless.  Denise, as always, is fun and motivating and if you incorporate this workout into your routine, you will see results.  This is a really good workout -- even for an advanced exerciser like me!",1320105600,,503,4.8023255813953485

Don't expect to jump in and be able to follow along on the first viewing - Some parts are complicated to follow but not overly complex.

Great dvd Denise!",1316563200,,372,4.013513513513513
2656089,3,B000IHY9UC,"I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. Actually, I expected more, considering that title. The workout presented by Denise Austin is simply not challenging enough. After going through both routines I wasn't in the least exhausted. This DVD may be suitable for a complete beginner, but for an experienced exerciser there are not enough challenging moves such as many repetitions of pushups of different kinds. From a DVD called Boot Camp I would have expected that. Moreover, I would have preferred one longer workout to two short ones.",1313798400,,535,5.022471910112359

2656093,2,B000IHY9UC,"I am a fairly fit person who was looking for an alternative to running when I broke my knee.  I ordered a stack of highly-rated workout videos and have been going through one.  This is my least-favorite of the bunch.

First, Denise Austin has an incredibly irritating voice (scratchy...I spent half of the workout wondering when the cigarette break was going to come) and equally irritating style.  ""Come on, you're a champion in your own way, yeah, yeah, be a champion, yeah, you're strong, yeah.""  Shut up!

Second, the workout itself (I did the Cardio segment, didn't try the strength or flexibility) was weak.  The last 10 minutes were decent: higher-intensity cardio followed by a decent if too-short ab workout.  But the first 10 minutes were pitiful and a waste of time.  If I'm doing a 20-min workout because I don't have time for a real one, I want it to be INTENSE.  This wan't, at all.  I don't think I would have broken a sweat except for it being 85 degrees 100% humidity out.

For people looking for a quick, high-intensity workout that will make you feel like you got your 20 mins worth, try Jillian Michaels, that's been my favorite of my test bunch.",1310428800,,1166,4.606796116504855
2656094,5,B000IHY9UC,This is a great dvd.  Two twenty minute hard work outs that are great for a working mom with little time.  I have always liked Denise Austin.  She works you hard and encourages you the entire time.  You will get a good work out in a short amount of time.,1297987200,,254,4.02
2656095,5,B000IHY9UC,"First some background so you know where I'm coming from:  I'm 30 years old, a mother of 3 children and asthmatic.  I've been working out for 12 years now and my exercise video collection is vast and varied.  I've done kickboxing, pilates, yoga, aerobics, resistance band, ball workouts... you name it... and I'm not talking about trying things for one or two workouts.  Usually I stick with something for about 3 months before switching up my routine again.  This video is in constant rotation... who am I kidding?  What rotation?!  I pretty much ignore my other videos and go straight for the Strength Boot Camp on this disk.  In my humble opinion, it's pretty much the most perfect workout ever created.  The short bursts of cardio keep my heart rate up the whole time (something that I have hard time accomplishing with my other workouts).  The weight moves are awesome... especially the butt move at the end (weight tucked behind your knee + leg lifts).  I've never seen this move on any of my other workouts.  It works better than anything else I've tried.  Lately I like to do this workout alternating with a PT Fitness ball workout I got for christmas (also 20 minutes long).  With the asthma, I find the short bursts of cardio are perfect for me.  It's challenging to find something that I can do without having to depend on my inhaler too much.  Also I'm prone to getting lung-related illnesses.  When this happens I lean more heavily on my ball workout and ease back into this one.  When I want to kick it up a notch, I add wrist weights.  I've tried Jillian Anderson's 30 Shred, and although I really liked it, the first time I got a really bad cold I couldn't do that one for weeks!  Not to mention I only ever made it to level 2 for about a week, before I caught a cold and then it was back to square one again.  It's too easy to fall off the wagon and it's too hard to get back on again with the 30 shred.  Yeah, I got a better sweat with 30 shred, but I get almost as good of a sweat with this one, only I don't feel like giving up on life.  The most telling evidence of how awesome this workout is?  My youngest  is 15 months old and I am already in shape again and this is primarily what I used.  With my last child it took me 3 YEARS to get back in shape!  This time around, I started with Cindy Crawford's New Dimension (which is what I used last time) and as soon as I was fit enough, I went straight to doing the Strength segment on this DVD.  I coupled it with the 6 minute ab routine on her 3-Week Bootcamp DVD.

If you are crunched for time (which I am) or just plain too lazy to do long, grueling 40 minute workouts (yup... that's me) or have a strictly hate-hate relationship with cardio (me, again) or the 30 Day Shred made you feel like giving up on life all together (yup), then this is the quickest way to get what you want.  Eat basically healthy, stretch, drink lots of water and do this workout 3 times a week (4 on a good week) and you'll see results!",1294704000,,2985,4.25044404973357
2656096,5,B000IHY9UC,"I'm 37 and a beginner.  I'm trying to get into shape, and have not really caught on to most of the exercise videos on the market.  I hate working out.  But......I can do this!  I'm up to the total 40 minute workout now.  These 20 minute segments go by really fast, and she packs in a lot in those 20 minutes.  You can customize the workout and double it with a 40 minute work out since there are two 20 minute segments.  There is a lot of squats, lunges, jumping, lifting weights, and floor exercises.  What I like the most is that after she has a cardio burst, she then goes to a short recovery phase, so your not doing cardio the whole way throught.  There are intervals in both cardio and strength training.  So, you will feel it in your legs, waist and arms!!  I'm glad I finally found a workout DVD that I can actually get through and not feel totally out-of-breath and lost.",1291075200,,880,4.240963855421687

I have tried to get used to it...
it is a good workout, almost the same one a superior instructor offered in Ann Arbor where I no longer live and was so sad to give up. This dvd points up just how different the kind of instruction you receive can make the workout.
Okay, Denise Austin reminds me of Catherine O'Hara (remember her from SCTV?) (or Funkhauser's crazy sister on Curb your enthusiasm more recently) doing an imitation of a truly insane workout instructor. She is just one step short of out of her mind. The cover of the dvd has been retouched to make her look less glazed and out of it. I think she's on something. She keeps repeating things like ""functional strength"" like, is there such a thing as dysfunctional strength?
Okay, I've wanted to get this off my chest for a long time. Like I said, the workouts are decent and I've been doing them because they are fast and I can get them over with quick and I have seen improvement. I just have to keep looking to find someone who is more a match for my temperament....",1286928000,3,1177,4.5046728971962615

2656101,3,B000IHY9UC,"I did the three workouts as one long workout (play all). I was thinking of writing this review as I exercised.  If I only did the first section, this review would have been much worse (only 2 stars).  I didn't like the Cardio Interval.  I mean it made me sweat, but I thought the cuing was horrible and the transitions between movements choppy.  She cued like okay now we we do the next exercise.  I was thinking, well I would do the next exercise if if it wasn't such a big secret!  Then, she would not do any counts and all of a sudden switch to the other side so I frequently did one less exercise on one side.  I think only because I have done so many differnt workouts that I was able to keep up with the transitions.  I'm worried about beginners pulling something, especially when she does the t-stand and plank segment.  Please be careful people!  The second and third sections Strength and Flexibility I thought were much better, and the only two I would do again.  I really felt that she worked my whole body in the Strength segment.  However, she didn't say how much weight to use.  I did 8 pounds because the segments are shorter than what I'm used to doing (20 minutes each for the Cardio Internval and Strength).  The Cardio Interval doesn't use weights.  I would recommend less weight for most people to start out.  The new twist to the 10 minute Flexibility section is instead of doing static stretches, you move through the stretches ""like athletes."" Again people be careful of your form.  There are no variations for beginning exercisers in any of the sections.  I got this DVD from the library so might do it again.  I would only recommend advanced beginners or intermediate exercisers like myself get this DVD because of the lack of cuing and types of exercises in the video.  So, the Cardio Interval gets 2 stars and the Strength Interval gets 4 stars for an average of 3 stars.",1267228800,3,1898,4.478134110787172

Not impressed at all I will never use this video.",1264464000,2,394,4.116883116883117

I had too many videos/DVDs that were more on a beginner/intermediate level and I had worn them out. This DVD is a little more advanced, gets your heart rate up more and leaves you feeling like you really worked out. In the past, Denise has been known more for beginner-level workouts (not that that's a bad thing), so she may surprise some of you with this one. I highly recommend it.

I would like to add that, as some other reviewers said, it doesn't quite work the arms as much as you might like. If that's an area of concern for you, you may want to add a few arm exercises afterward on your own. Other than that, it's a great workout!",1263859200,3,798,4.215686274509804

I have been mostly a yoga/walking girl for some time now.  I am 42 and realized that although I exercise everyday, I am missing true cardio in my fitness program. So, having had Denise's ""Power Yoga Plus"" and ""Fat Blasting Yoga"" I decided to try her other DVD's.

I am really happy I did.  I love this DVD because the workout starts quickly, my heart rate went right up and it is not boring at all.  You don't need a lot of space and the moves are easy to modify.  I felt SO GOOD doing this workout. I felt POWERFUL and STRONG and SEXY and it was FUN, too!  And boy, I could feel my heart working and it felt very good, very healthy. This is what I love about Denise Austin's videos...you start feeling good immediately and they are not boring. I always feel so so so good doing her videos.  Truly the joy of movement and exercise.

As far as her personality...I find her refreshing.  She is sweet, encouraging, totally lacking ego all while being very very successful. I like her humility. In a world where so many instructors never smile, have a sense of over importance and take themselves too seriously...I prefer Denise.  She is a refreshing change.

In fact, I so like her energy...she cheers me up a bit.  So, not only do you get a great workout, but you get some positive, cheerful vibes. It may not mesh with everyone, but for me she adds sunlight.

THANK YOU DENISE for being FUN, AFFORDABLE, EFFECTIVE and POSITIVE!!!  I am very much looking forward to trying her other videos.",1256256000,31,1562,4.431578947368421
2656139,2,B000IHY9UC,"Like other reviewers said, Denise has been doing this for so long and yet she is so inadequate. The impact is definitely much higher in this workout (which is rare), than in most of her other DVDs that are typically extremely non-challenging, but the whole routine feels thrown together, made up as you go. There are NEVER enough reps, sides are not worked evenly and if I hear, 'train like an athlete' or 'bootaful' one more time I have to throw up. I normally get pumped up with high-impact cardio, but this workout is extremely non-motivating even though I was sweating pretty good. She talks non-stop in a very annoying manner and the music is blah. I felt very unsatisfied afterwards and I'm so done trying her workouts. Denise is seriously far below the standard of today's instructors.",1254355200,2,792,4.746376811594203

2656161,5,B000IHY9UC,"I found while following this program that Denise Austin has a problem with cuing and an inability to keep the beat.  However, if an instructor can provide a great workout, I am very forgiving of these things.  This work out is excellent, and thus I can forgive Denise Austin for the skills she lacks.

From my understanding of a ""Boot Camp"" workout, it is a workout that shifts from move to move at a rather fast pace.  The instructor gets your heart pumping with interval training so you are constantly going from high to low to high to low.  You don't spend a lot of time on one move because ""Boot Camp"" is about moving quickly.  If you like this kind of workout, than this DVD is for you.  If you are someone who needs constant repetition in your workout or is not into interval training, than I suggest you try something else.

I would not suggest this DVD for a beginner.  This workout is for those persons who are intermediate/advanced.  If you are hesitant about purchasing this DVD, I suggest you look at your local library first.  I found this DVD at my library and checked it out.  I liked it so much that I purchased it a week later.  Denise Austin is a great motivator and keeps you going!",1251244800,2,1201,4.380090497737557

Just started using this DVD 3 days ago during my lunch time (work from home) and the 20 minute work-outs fit in great.  Wow! Am I out of shape.  Started out with the Cardio section.  Finally made it all the way through on day 2.  On day 3 I was too sore to make it halfway through again.  It's a good overall workout.  If the jumping is too much, take that down a notch on the resting sets.  I'm going to give myself a full week on this set before I add in the Flexibility segment.  It will be a while before I'm ready to do the entire thing.  I'm hoping this DVD will keep me interested long enough for me to get there.

I couldn't believe I wasted my money or time on this DVD and donated it to Goodwill after doing it only once.",1221177600,4,442,4.432098765432099

The toning is mostly squats/lunges with some weights.  They need more arm exercises.  I add my own back/chest ones at the end of the workout. Otherwise, I'd have given it a 4.  The Personal Training dvd is much better. Get that instead of this one if you don't already have it.",1221091200,2,434,4.047058823529412
2656201,2,B000IHY9UC,The workout itself is not too bad. Definately works up a sweat and is a pretty hard workout. I hate it so much because Denise is over the top annoying. I can't stand her voice or her comments. If you put the video on mute its not too bad. I guess it depends what your looking for.,1220486400,,280,3.9298245614035086
2656202,4,B000IHY9UC,I bought this dvd because I wanted something more intense. I tried to do both 20 miunte exercises right after each other but they are both really intense and kept you moving so I could only do 20 minutes at a time. I felt like I really got a complete workout. It really toned up my thighs.,1218931200,,289,4.087719298245614

I had to give it 4 stars though b/c even after doing this DVD for a few months pretty regularly, I cannot keep track of what she's doing unless the volume is up.  And when you first start, even with the volume up and paying attention to everything, she's hard to follow b/c she changes directions without mentioning it.  But this is a very good work out, especially if you put all 3 segments together, and I feel it's worth the money.",1218499200,,549,4.20952380952381

This DVD kicked my butt the first time I did it, partly because I wasn't expecting such a good workout! It's a GREAT lower body workout. Expect a LOT of squats! It also does a good job working your core, and of course, it's great cardio. It doesn't, however, offer much for the upper body. You'll have to do that seperately. It's not an easy video, but it's not boring, either. Great for rainy days that you don't want to turn into off days, and it beats the treadmill!",1215820800,2,572,4.256880733944954

I would recommend it to someone looking to step up their work outs...I'd say it is moderate to high...",1215388800,,356,4.144927536231884

Not only is Denise incredibly annoying with her CONSTANT chattering of ""Alright, let's go, you're doing great, we're working out, we're getting fit, we're looking lean, to the right, now lift... blah blah blah blah!!!!!"" Are you serious!!!??? And why is voice raspy like she's trying to sound like a 900 operator? I couldn't finish 10 minutes! Not because it was too hard, not at all, infact if it would have been a good workout then I might have suffered through Denise for the benefit, but the workout was boring, unchallenging, and repeticious!!!

Transitions between exercises were rushed and confusing and Denise's cues were very sloppy.  Strength exercises were very fast and I found myself going at my own pace so I did not compromise proper form.  Denise is a little annoying and far from a ""Drill Sergeant"" and I would probably put the tv on mute if I ever use this DVD again.",1212192000,,448,4.439024390243903

2656232,4,B000IHY9UC,"Both workouts are very efficient for 20 minutes each.  I only do the 10 minute stretch once in a while as I am fitting in a workout before going to work, but I stretch during the day.  Important to stretch as these workouts will tighten your muscles and I like to maintain my flexibility as I am 46 years old.  I must modify the higher impact moves because of arthritic knees.  For example, the knees up high running in the first segment...no way I can do that.  However, I keep my heart rate up by marching or jogging in place not letting my toes leave the floor.  I felt an improvement in upper body strength after a week. I have done Pilates work outs and so I am familiar with the ""T"" stands, but if you are not, you can modify it and work up to the advanced way.  The lower hovers really work my abs.  At first my whole torso shook in trying to keep correct form, but now I am stronger and can hold myself up.  Both segments require moderate agility and balance.  The second segment utilizes weights.  It looks like they are using 5lb weights.  I have gone up to 8, but I would not go heavier as the exercises are not meant to be done with very heavy weights.  If I give it my all, I do work up a good sweat in 20 minutes and feel like I accomplished a workout for the day.  You can't beat that feeling for getting the day off to a good start.  I recommend mixing it up with a variety of other workouts such as: pilates, yoga and dance aerobics.  I hope this was helpful.  Good health to you.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who want to see result in their body without going out to the gym. I have recently gave birth to my 3rd baby and I definitely want to get back in shape.

As an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser, they normally don't give me quite the workout I need, and she has a tendency to be a little perky and even condescending sometimes....by that I mean she assumes everyone working out is totally new to this and needs constant instruction over simple things.  Maybe because I am advanced, I find that annoying, but that is my opinion.  Anyway, after reading the reviews for this, I thought I would give it a try.  It was a better workout than I thought it would be.  Not as good as many others, but good enough to put in the rotation now and then to fend off boredom.",1204243200,,658,4.589743589743589

The second 20-minute workout is much better since she talks less. And I really like the 10-minute stretching session at the end.

I can not think of any trainer on DVD/Vidoe that has not screwed up somewhere in the work out!
A work out is only as good as the effort you put into it! That said this is not for the beginner - if you do not know your basic moves this may be a bit fast paced for you.

This is a really fun, get your heart rate up, complete workout!  I had to modify some of the moves for the knee/weight issue but plan to be on top of this workout in a matter of weeks.  Denise is, as always, upbeat, easy to understand and straight to the point.  The music is generic so it doesn't take away from her instruction.

What I like about this DVD is that there are different segments.  There is the cardio, strength and flexibility.  Today I did the cardio with flexibility.  It was a quick, 30-40 minutes and just right for starting out.  This is the type of DVD you can modify for your level, as I did, stepping side instead of jacking and knee lifts instead of jogging, etc.  This will be a long term DVD to grow with you.

Denise Austin has her eyes open as wide as possible, and it sounds like she's talking to a bunch of sesame streeters. She should really consider developing an exercise program for children. I could not take her seriously. She sporadically jumps from move to move and by the time you start doing the correct move, she jumps to the next. I'm all for high intensity, but let me know what the hell to do before you go balls to the wall. The only plus is the 10min stretching section.",1185148800,12,550,4.349514563106796

I had been trying Pilates most day, and while I enjoyed this exercise, it really wasn't helping me to reach my goals. I realized I needed to do some cardio. My boyfriend, knowing this, purchased this DVD for me. I must say, I am quite pleased he did.

Denise is an excellent instructor. She is extremely enthusiastic, something that I found very motivational. The DVD is divided into three sections: cardio interval training (20 minutes), strength interval training (mixed with a little cardio - 20 minutes), and a stretching segment (10 minutes). The DVD allows you to create custom workouts so that you can take multiple segments and have them follow each other. The workouts are up to date and highly effective. The cardio is a vigorous workout. If you haven't exercised in a while it might be something you have to work up to.

I started doing this DVD for 20 minutes every other day, alternating with Pilates. This was a good decision, as it lead to the weight lose I desired over the course of about four months I was able to drop eight pounds, increase my endurance, and tone effectively.

I highly recommend this workout, as well as other DVDs by Denise Austin. Her workouts are fun, she is highly motivating, and the results are impressive.",1184889600,3,1330,4.651063829787234

I was very disappointed with the workout on the DVD. I am not going to criticize Denise though because I found her as the host/leader to be alright. What I didn't care for was the choreography on this DVD. There were several things about the choreography that I didn't like such as the fact that so few reps are done on each exercise and just as you really getting into one exercise it is time to move on to the next. There is a lot of jumping and bouncing involved which I don't really care for, and this workout requires you to have an extraordinary amount of balance. I also didn't feel like I worked out. I consider this DVD to be a moderate workout and I was hoping for a heavy workout. I also felt like this DVD was misleading. On the case it says there is kick boxing and there was very little kick boxing used in this workout.

All in all, I just didn't really like this workout DVD and found it boring and it just wasn't my cup of tea. I do, however, highly recommend Kathy Smith, Leslie Sansone or TamiLee Webb.",1184716800,78,1162,4.164444444444444

A couple of months ago I graduated college and moved out to a tiny apartment in a big city with my boyfriend and needed to find a way to workout without paying big bucks for a gym and without running in the dangerous area I live in.

This was the answer. I consider myself in great shape, and was very skeptical about girly workout videos. Since I started this video my flexibility improved greatly, I've become more defined, and my balance has improved. I never weigh myself, but if you eat your greens and use this workout tape, you will lose fat. Also, I'm very muscular and was worried about getting ""big,"" and this doesn't do that at all.

I was also very concerned about how cheesy this was going to be. I didn't want to look like an idiot working out in front of my boyfriend, and you really don't do anything ridiculous, like some of the dance cardio stuff out there. In fact, sometimes he jumps in and tries to keep up.

My suggestion: do the 40 minute workout every other day, and use Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip (disk 2) every other day. Results are amazing.",1181952000,69,1154,4.459715639810427

This DVD has three parts,
strength training (20 mins)
cardio (20 mins)
stretching (10 mins)

I first did the strength segment (20 minutes)...Denise combines cardio tae bo type of kicks with strength training arm moves. It's REALLY good. I couldn't get through all the squats. man that woman loves squats! I was drenched in sweat and it was fun. She goes back and forth between ""jumping rope"", ""shuffle"", kicks and strength training moves. there are a few yoga moves in there too. I love that all her moves are like 2-in-1 you're working two parts at once. By the way you'll need some dumbbells!

I just wanted to add (I'm adding this a few weeks later) that I was initialy very sore from all the squats and my legs burned for a couple of days! but now I'm doing it no problem. This remains one of my favorite work outs.

then I did the second part, the cardio (20 minutes) it was fun and intense.
She sure makes me sweat!

Then I did the stretch segment (10 mins) It's not just stretching it's pilates like movements focusing on stretching and core.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the stretching segment. I do the stretching segment after other work outs. Something about it makes my body feel really good and alive.

My body feels good! I can't wait to do this workout. Let me just say something about Denise Austin, at first I was turned off by her peppiness but now i LOVE her. Her videos are the best and alternating doing a bunch of them is doing wonders. The personal trainer DVD kicks my buttox ridiculously! This will be a good balance. I think this DVD was great because it's hard to get me sweaty in my own livingroom (when I don't feel like jogging outside) and this really got me sweaty and my arms and legs feel so good from doing it. I definitely recommend this DVD even if it's the only one you'll have. Her stretching is awesome. Thank you Denise. :) you rule!!",1178928000,,1924,4.423728813559322

It is not by any means super intense as the title of the DVD suggests so don't let that scare you away.  The stage is though, like a ""boot camp"" room.

Since then I've lost 30 pounds.  I bought this workout DVD and was not disappointed!  It's probably a little too much for those who are just starting out (like I was 4 months ago!)and not enough for those hard-core extreme exercisers.  It's just right for where I am right now.  I like Denise's bubbly personality but sometimes her cues and/or rhythm are off.  This is a faster paced workout.  Sometimes I do one section or both and then always the stretch.

I like to do the workouts back to back for a thorough 40 minute workout.

2656578,4,B000IHY9UC,"I have several of her exercise DVD's .... This is not my favorite but I do enjoy it.  It's very cardio-intensive, it certainly works up a sweat, but I don't feel like I get enough ab and arm workout from it.  I will do the cardio section along with my Shrink Your Female Fat Zone DVD but if I do this whole DVD then I add an ab and arm workout from another DVD.  But, am glad I purchased this DVD.",1173312000,,397,3.876543209876543
2656579,4,B000IHY9UC,"I love Denise Austin's pilates and toning DVD's, but I normally stay away from her cardio routines because of her difficulty staying in rhythm.  However, I am delighted that I took a chance on this one. Denise manages to stay in rhythm most of the time. It is a really good workout for the intermediate level exerciser and it is also a lot of good fun.",1172275200,4,352,4.333333333333333

The people are all squatty and chubby looking - not exactly a great inspiration in a workout tape!!  I went back to amazon and nowhere did I see clear lables of ""full screen"" or ""widescreen"" or anything else like that.  While I realize I probably ordered the wrong version, I can't find where I could've done otherwise.  Very disappointed and don't know if I'll even use the DVD as it's so hard to watch this way.  Be warned and don't make my mistake - order the correct version for your TV (if you can).",1171929600,,600,4.228070175438597

The warmup is part of the first 20 minute segment.  A 10 minute stretching workout is also included.  It really gets you moving and is a serious workout - definitely not a fluff workout.

2656597,5,B000IHY9UC,I am a Denise fan. I love her enthusiasm. I feel like she's cheering me on and even though some are annoyed by it I am energized by it. This is one of her best videos yet. And if you have the time do both 20 min segments followed by the 10 min stretch in one workout you will be so alive when you're done!! When pressed for time either 20 min segment is awesome. I absolutely love the switch from plank to t-stand and the downward dog to plank to push-up moves. So much fun!! It's challenging and I def don't recommend it for a beginner or someone who is a little rusty. There are a ton of squats and a few jumps from squat that are even difficult for me if I'm tired or sore that day. I work out regularly and I can still see where I can improve and can't wait until I do this video with absolute precision. It's invigorating!!! Oh - and I love Denise's shoes in the 1st segment. Too cute!!,1170460800,8,891,4.01123595505618

Boot Camp is great for me because it is a fast and effective workout, which is what I need.  I am a working mom with two children so time for me is limited.  It is nice to be able to put in this video and do a quick 20 minute cardio workout. I usually combine this workout with an additional 10 to 15 minute AB workout.",1170028800,4,442,3.932584269662921

The exercises in this workout are really good.  I believe that if you do this a couple of times a week, you are going to see definate results.  I just hope you can get past her uber enthusiasm.  Sometimes she looks possessed.

So turn down the sound and learn the moves so you can do this without the disc so you can get the benefit of a brilliant routine and workout, without the painful out of time 'instruction' from Denise.",1169683200,13,598,4.201754385964913

Though many of the moves are challenging (squat to jump, for example) the segments change often enough that it's not overwhelming. You're still using your whole body with each move, just in different ways. This workout also combines cardio and strength-training in a creative and fun way.

Highly recommend!",1169424000,15,476,4.523255813953488
2656603,5,B000IHY9UC,Denise does it again (I want her abs).  This workout is two in one.  You are doing cardio and strength training at once.  This workout is great for people with little time who say they don't have time to workout.  Denise splits the DVD into two 20 minute workouts with a really great flexibility and stretch sequence at the end (about ten minutes).

After several weeks, I notice my thighs look thinner, my arms look more toned, and my lower abs don't have the same ""pooch"" they used to.

8145420,4,B000IHY9UC,"As someone who is not a Denise Austin fan, I enjoyed this workout. I had pretty much written her off after trying a few that just left me feeling annoyed and frustrated. This one left me feeling energized, and I may purchase it. (I've only done it as part of my free trial of BeFiT).

The actual moves are great. I liked the combinations she put together. The active-isolated stretching was new to me, and I really was left feeling like I had greater range of motion in my joints. I personally felt that the workout could be longer, with more time spent on each move (or less variety in the same time frame). It seemed that just was I was really feeling the burn, it would be time to switch or recover. But I'm coming off of a Jillian Michaels cycle, and I give her major credit for building my endurance. This IS a similar concept to a lot of Jillian's circuit-type workouts and I actually like the flow of this one better. (The obvious cuts after EACH 6 min Jillian circuit annoys me and messes with my motivation).

Denise is not the best at cues. I didn't find this weakness as obvious in this workout as it is in her ""dance"" style workouts where rhythm, cueing, and matching the music are essential. If you're pretty new to ""aerobics"", you'll be very frustrated and find it difficult to keep up.

If you're familiar with Denise Austin, you know she is over-the-top bubbly and encouraging. Her breathy, wide-eyed, sing-songy cheers usually get on my nerves, but I found myself grinning and having fun with a lot it. Be prepared for lots of ""you're a winner! Champion! Athlete! Do the best that YOU can! YES!"" I feel like I definitely earned a participation ribbon ;-)",1494201600,4,1671,4.490131578947368
