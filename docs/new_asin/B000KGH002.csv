""The Fighting Westerner"" [1935] begins with a rider who visits an empty house. Larry Sutton meets the Deputy Sheriff Tex Murdock. Larry has a letter of introduction (to replace Parsons). Mr. Borg is dead due to a mining ""accident"". Parsons was accused of murder, but he disappeared. ""What noise?"" Larry wants to learn more about this crime, and visits the Ballard's house. Two huge dogs guard the house. Relatives talk about their presumed inheritance. Larry knows about radium mining. One gram of radium sold for $37,000! Mr. Ballard is confined to bed. Larry meets Rita Ballard. How valuable is the mine? Who wrote that warning note? The stamping mill makes a noise; Fritz was murdered! Ballard tells about his will; if an inheritor dies his share will not be divided among the others. We learn about the people there. Who shot at John Borg? Who stole Borg's body? Larry advises building a new factory; Ballard disagrees. Will the Black Rider strike again? Is a girl in danger? Will a search of Mrs. Ballard's rooms reveal anything? Is a hoofprint as individual as fingerprints? Was that Jack Parson's horse? What happened to Rita? The former Mrs. Ballard arrives, she wants to see Mr. Ballard. A masquerade is over. Larry figured it out. Borg makes a deal with Larry - can he be trusted? Larry tries to rescue Rita from Borg. Justice triumphs. Rita and Larry will be sitting on top of the world.

This story was adapted from a Zane Grey novel ""Golden Dreams"". It is basically a murder mystery set in a mansion, where heirs to a fortune are eliminated so someone will inherit a fortune. This story reminded me of Dashiell Hammett's short story ""Night Shots"". ""Eyewitness evidence is most credible when it is supported by circumstantial evidence."" [This was also titled ""Rocky Mountain Mystery"".]

The story of ""Abilene Town"" [1946] begins with a herd of Hereford cattle in 1870. A thousand miles of cattle trails stretched from Texas to Abilene Kansas. The cowboys get paid and celebrated like sailors after a long voyage. One side of town has places that catered to young men who wanted a good time. Shots are fired. The town has two rules for visiting cowboys: check your guns with the bartender, and don't cross Texas Street (the decent part of town). The saloons attract trail-hands, their cash makes the town prosperous. Settlers arrive in town. The cattlemen don't want homesteaders. A cowboy argues with a gambler and loses again. The Town Marshal keeps things peaceful so the dollars roll in. Sheriff Bravo Tremble has a different attitude from the Marshal. Someone robbed the train? What can the Sheriff do? The homesteaders came for their government land. They produce crops. The Sheriff visits a saloon, its owner worries about his future. A man shoots at the Marshal then hides in the theater. We hear another song and see dancing girls. Rats in the basement? A long dull evening? The Marshal visits a rooming house for young women. Rita loves her life. Outside of town riders burn out a settler and shoot a man. Then they attack the settler's camp. Who wants to drive the settlers away? One of the riders was recognized: Jeff Younger. The Marshal visits the saloon, and is offered a job by Charlie.

Sheriff Bravo forms a posse to search for the killer. Marshal Mitchell has a clue, but the Sheriff is in command. Sheriff Bravo plays cards with a sod buster. ""Let's deal again."" The Town Marshal captures Jeff alive to bring him back to town. The Sheriff looks for votes! The people cheer his return. There is another song. Mitchell visits Rita. Jeff escaped from jail with a gun. What will the Sheriff do? Marshall Dan ends it. Will Abilene ever change? Shelly says Dan loves his job too much. The homesteaders must organize to fight for their rights by fencing their lands with barbed wire. Is it a crime to work hard for yourself? The cattle stampede past the fences and destroy what is in their way. Mr. Boulder does the math: 500 families will generate more sales than from cowboys. Marshal Dan closes the saloons. Charlie hesitates. Riker's gang arrives to break into the saloons. Shelly can handle a gun. ""I'm proud of you."" Sheriff Tremble will lead the men, who sing as they march. A wide open town? Marshal Dan tries to arrest Riker. The cowboys are told to ride out of town peaceably. The fight is over, the townspeople won. [This was adapted from the novel ""Trail Town"" by Ernest Haycox. It has songs, romance, action, comedy, and economic conflict.]",1345593600,,4521,4.7774936061381075
