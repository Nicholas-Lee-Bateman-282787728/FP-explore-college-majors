8388403,5,B000M8NMWI,Pride offered a different flavor from the UFC and something about Japan gave the sport some honor.  Watching events in Pride were more professional than in the US as the audience was respectful.  You didn't have a mob booing because they didn't have a clue about ground battles.  US crowds appear to be a bunch of drunk maniacs and tend to put a damper on some of the matches.  We NEED some traditional Pride bouts to create a competitive atmosphere.,1198540800,,450,4.5875
