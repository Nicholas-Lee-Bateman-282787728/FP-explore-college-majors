8530122,1,B008RZHDSW,"I really enjoy Billy Graham but this DVD does nothing to tell about him at all. It consists of 1 country song singing about him. Other than the 1 song it's all about people saying ""thank you Billy Graham"". No story to it what so ever, just ""thank you Billy Graham"".",1357171200,7,265,4.215686274509804
