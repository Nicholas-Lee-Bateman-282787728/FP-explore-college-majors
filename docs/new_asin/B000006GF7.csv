1193610,5,B000006GF7,"This is one of the greatest artistic artworks made in USA in the middle of the eighties . Christopher Cain sketched a film based in the feelings of pain , anguish , blame and suffering through  a boy who accidentally shoots his older brother whom he adored . This unbearable feeling makes to him to isolate from the outer world .

Sublime , artistic , exquisite, haunting and original movie .

Acquire this outstanding and mature film . The cast with Glenn Close , Frederic Forrest and Robert Duvall is first rate .

To my mind one of the top twenty American films in that decade!",1104969600,6,580,4.443396226415095
1193611,5,B000006GF7,A very powerful movie regarding a rural family and the tragic events that set the movie into action. I loved it. The pain struggle and lose the family goes through. How the boy deals with his fate and altimately overcomes. A movie of the heart and soul. A most see and own. Thumbs up.,1024617600,4,284,4.277777777777778
1193612,5,B000006GF7,"I saw this movie quite a few years ago and was deeply moved.  It is a film that is quiet and slow, but that provides the patient viewer with innumerable rewards.  The plot concerns the accidental death of the oldest son in the family and the blame placed on the youngest son for this death.  Although the family does not directly blame the youngest son, he feels tremendous guilt and the family memebers slowly pull away from him and each other.  The movie has a great feel for rural families and small-town life and doesn't provide any easy answers or excess sentiment.  Look for Linda Hamilton in a small early role as a bus passenger.",1012521600,10,637,4.504347826086956

1193636,2,B000006GF7,I'm a big Robert Duvall fan. However this movie didn't do anything for me. It was a long way around Robin's barn to tell how a young boy came to terms of accidentally killing his brother. Too slow. One other thing. I did like Wilford Brimmley in this role. He always plays a down to earth kind of guy and you don't get short changed here. Yet not enough to make this a good movie.,1365033600,,380,4.08
1193637,3,B000006GF7,"The acting is superb, if you enjoy these actors. I just felt that while the story might have had newly explored themes at the time, this story has been told many times.  Not disappointing.  Not surprising but very well done.",1364083200,,224,4.575
1193638,3,B000006GF7,"I chose this film for the cast.  However, the film doesn't hold water in a few places - where it is trying to ""bring you in,"" it just kind of leaves you hanging. You can't quite penetrate the outer layer.  It's a good story - and the grandfather is a great character and has a meaningful relationship with the boy. However, the realism of the story falls apart when the boy runs away from home, etc. It just doesn't hold the interest and the credibility as it should, despite the realism of the setting, plot, and characters.",1360195200,,525,4.402061855670103

1193640,5,B000006GF7,"I saw this when it first came out.  The film builds with a slow, powerful undercurrent.  The climax of the movie is subtle and unexpected.  When I saw it in the theater, the person I was with and I started crying in the same that the characters were crying in the story.  It was as incredibly cathartic a scene as any I have seen.",1309478400,2,330,4.109375
1193641,4,B000006GF7,"The story is about how a family must first overcome their own anger,and feelings of sorrow to forgive and grow,after their youngest son accidently shoots and kills his older brother(Cain)in the field,while collecting eggs for breakfast. When he covers up the incident from his family and they eventually find the son,the mother grows silently angry and resents the youngest boy for the loss of her son. The father becomes cold and distant as well to spare his feeling for his wife(Close).The grandfather takes in the youngest son,and along the way teaches the son,to come to grips with what he has done and to confess the truth to the parents about the death of the eldest son,so the family can come together to begin to heal in the end and realize that accidents do happen and we should bond together to learn to forgive,heal and understand that we are all not perfect and grow from those mistakes in life.",1256515200,,907,4.746835443037975
1193642,5,B000006GF7,"If Robert Duvall is in a movie, it's gots ta be good. Robert is 1 of the best actors of all times in my book. This actually is a pretty good little movie, you must see.",1232236800,4,168,3.6944444444444446
1193643,3,B000006GF7,This movie is about a family mourning the loss of their 17 year old son/brother etc.. The younger boy accidently shot him and he stuggles to come to grip with all of what happened.  His grandfather helps him out alot. It is a sad story. A nice addition to any movie collection. It is worth watching.,1228780800,4,299,4.339285714285714

7904286,5,B000006GF7,The Stone Boy is a real classic. Based upon Gina Berriault's short story of the same name I found this to be very powerful and thought provoking. It addresses the dynamics of a family dealing with the grief and loss of an older son and how each member copes with the tragedy. I highly recommend this movie.,1480204800,,306,4.385964912280702
