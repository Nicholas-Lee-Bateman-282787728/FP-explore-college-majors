6941669,5,B00S1LDWD2,"Started watching this show on MHZ on our antenna TV when we got rid of our cable and fell in love with these two characters. The series is very well written, produced and acted out with just a perfect hint of darkness for me personally. The series balances the detective work part of the plot with the changing relationships of many of the characters over the series. Bravo. This is just plain great entertainment and I plan to buy both sets.",1426809600,6,442,4.469135802469136
6941670,5,B00S1LDWD2,"This series is great!  We've seen both sets on MHZ television's ""International Mystery"" series and my husband and I really enjoyed them.  The characters are well developed and extremely complex and interesting.  The relationship between the two detectives begins with great suspicion on both sides and evolves into a true friendship and partnership.  We love seeing different parts of the world and have, through MHZ found the European mystery/thrillers to be way better than most American ones.  They are much more realistic and cast people in less than perfect physical condition who are not trying to look 25.  In other words, they seem very real, believable and in most cases, very likable.  (There have to be characters you love to hate.)  Even the villains are complex.  The characters' personal lives are also part of the story lines but not to the point that they are distracting.  Subtitles are clear and easy to read and it's fun to hear languages other than English.  Highly recommended!",1425686400,22,998,5.024390243902439
8696834,4,B00S1LDWD2,"I disagree with one reviewer that ""Marie's Mind for Murder"" is far better than ""Bukow & Koenig"". Of course everybody has different taste so nobody is wrong, but personally I sum it up like this: If you love Hollywood movies/TVs, go with ""Marie"". It is a Hollywood drama made in Germany. If you hate Hollywood stuff, go with ""Bukow"". If you cannot stand actors with plastic looks, premeditated unnatural lines, childish ""good guys are immaculate angels, bad guys are pure evil and good guys beat up bad guys"" moral stories, then in ""Bukow"" the characters are far more human with moral ambiguities and personal struggles. The hand-held camera work some people complain about is pretty common these days, and whether it is effective or not, does not bother me at all.

One thing I do feel though is, the episodes are a little inconsistent, depending on the directors/writers (there are multiple), some have more solid feel, others a little over the top, not very believable.",1469664000,3,971,4.884848484848485

8696837,3,B00S1LDWD2,"Bukow and Konig is a German crime drama set in the Baltic seaport town of Rostock. The show focuses on the interaction of two antagonistic leads as they battle grittier personal crime: killings, gangs, people smuggling, and corruption. He: Alexander ""Sasha"" Bukow is a native of the rougher part of the former East German city. He is late 30ish, tall, slightly pudgy, married with two children, slovenly but intelligent and knows the area. He returned to the local Rostock police from a more prestigious posting in Berlin, somewhat under a cloud. His father remains in Rostock where he owns a nightclub and has danced between the two sides of the law all his life. The father, Viet Bukow, is, or has been involved with boxing, money laundering, drugs, and smuggling of all sorts. With his father's record, neither the father nor the son are entirely trusted by other police, even if Viet has been an informant for many years and, thus, protected by higher-ups. Bukow's co-worker is Katrin Konig, a single, tightly wound, plain-looking, respected, by-the-book professional from the equally rough North Sea harbor town of Hamburg. She is a member of the LKA, the State Criminal Police and was partnered with Bukow to allow the ever-observant Konig to spy on Bukow to learn why a major Berlin anti-crime operation failed.

Neither character appears very likeable and only after a few episodes dos the viewer begin to warm to them; him more than her.  Both have personal backstories that play through the nine hour and a half episodes. Her 's is more interesting and, sadly, more believable, than the weak plot line cooked up for him. His backstory, which I won't spill here, is symptomatic of unimaginative writing and it's elimination would only improve the program.

The stories are really pretty good: engaging, detailed and complex while being understandable in their everyday familiarity. It is part of the Polizief 110 series of German crime shows; like the Tatort series or NBC's old Sunday Night Mystery Movies. This is the first show I have ever seen incorporating Pink Floyd in an episode: ""Shine On, You Crazy Diamond!"" It really caught my attention.

Rating this series has been hard. While the plots, setting, acting, writing (until the last two weaker efforts), earn high marks, the massively aggravating hand-held camera was so irritating that I had to ask myself if I wanted to continue watching. The camera pans and shakes; scans and shakes; zooms in and out and shakes some more. All the while the non-German speaking viewer is trying to read the subtitles over the fast cuts and edits. The hand-held camera is NOT artistic; it is a Pain! The last two episodes are not as shaky as the first seven. The other major negative, is that the program is as foul-mouthed as a Seth Rogan movie. Almost the first word out of Konig's mouth in her first appearance in the first scene of the first episode, is the ""f"" word. The language doesn't let up from there. Parents should also note two brief nude scenes, which include one completely unnecessary sex scene.

Mhz has placed ""bonus"" episodes of different German programs that it sells on the third disk of each set. One is an episode of Cenk Batu: Undercover Agent and the other; a very funny episode of the German comedy, Crime Scene Cleaner, which includes Bukow and Konig.

If a third series became available, I would want to know the nature of the camera work. If the director persists in using the colossally irritating shaky camera, I would not, for one second, consider purchasing it. On the other hand, if the camera was not part of the story, I would probably buy, the story is that good. In short, if you can tolerate the hand-held camera, four stars seems quite reasonable. If you cannot, than skip this.",1457827200,,3772,4.82225656877898
8696838,2,B00S1LDWD2,"Uncharismatic leads, annoyingly constant (and unnecessary) hand-held camera shots, confusing plots -- avoid this series and choose Marie's Mind for Murder, a far better alternative if you want something German.",1453852800,,210,6.033333333333333
8696839,5,B00S1LDWD2,"If you are looking for foreign mysteries/ police procedurals, look no further than MHz network. It is on line,band brings us the best. The most recent arrival is a German group, Bukow and Konig.  Bukow and K&ouml;nig stars Charly H&uuml;bner and Anneke Kim Sarnau  in the roles of police inspector Alexander Bukow and criminal profiler Katrin K&ouml;nig.

 Bukow has returned to his hometown of Rostock after 17 years in Berlin, where he becomes Chief Inspector. He is married, with two children. His return is a mystery for some, but Katrin Konig has been asked to investigate Bukow. This Issa difficult assignment since she's works directly with him.

Katrin K&ouml;nig, is a native of Hamburg, and was recently transferred to Rostock. She is a very attractive, single, woman. We find she is vegetarian and runs every day before work. She is very controlling and like Bukow in the first episodes of this series, she loves and lives her work. I found her work confusing, she is a criminal analyst and profiler for LKA, the State Criminal Police, but she also takes the lead on some cases. I did not find her criminal profiling as part of her job, she was more a colleague detective.

The first year series concentrates a lot on a Balkan Mafia boss, Zoran Subocek. He is involved in a lot of nasty stuff, and it is Bukow's reality that he wants to get this guy. Bukow also has a temper issue and could use some anger management. We get bits and pieces of why he left Berlin, but not all of the story. The episodes are very well done, and this is my new favorite.

8696840,3,B00S1LDWD2,"While this show is fun to watch, I was disappointed to discover that the English subtitles were embedded in the video and I could not remove them. I bought this as a present for my father who speaks German fluently and enjoys practicing German by watching TV shows. Aside from this glitch he enjoys the show (and tries to ignore the subtitles)!",1452038400,,344,4.564516129032258
8696841,5,B00S1LDWD2,I like the stories on this set.  I think they are speaking German.  She is checking to see if Bukow is doing his job and checking a history of one of his cases.,1443830400,,160,3.8181818181818183
8696842,3,B00S1LDWD2,"Good but not great. Good enough that I ordered Season 2. The episodes in Season 1 are a bit ""uneven."" I agree with other comments that the characters are interesting and it IS refreshing that they cast ""real people"" in the lead and supporting roles, not following the usual Hollywood practice of only going with ""10""s.

Unlike Nordic Noir series set in Denmark, the landscapes here are pug-ugly. Rostock is a dirty, gritty harbor city and there appears to be almost no greenery anywhere. Visually this kind of detracts from the series, unless your taste in ""Noir"" includes really ugly sets.

For Americans the series is also a bit challenging understanding issues that arise from the somewhat difficult reuinification of the two Germanys---like at one point there's a comment that Eastern German frogmen were refused entry into the Berlin frogmen police unit because they were too brutal. You have to know a bit about history to understand this. That's not at all the fault of the series, after all it is German, but something American viewers should be aware of.

Finally, something that really troubles me is how Konig concludes her investigation into Bukow's corruption. Bukow admits that when a Mafia chieftain kidnaps his child, to get the child back, Bukow alters evidence against the mafia chief, as well as giving him the name of the chief witness, who is later murdered. Konig drags it out thru the 5 episodes but ultimately decides NOT to include any of this in her report, thereby exonerating Bukow. It's had to respect her for doing this, nor to respect Bukow, albeit one can understand his fear about his child, in the hands of a murderous gangster renowned for stabbing victims in their eyes. But I can't excuse either one for their behaviors. I'm rather hoping this will be explained away in Season 2 as a dream sequence or some kind of complex undercover operation!",1441497600,2,1881,4.853582554517134
