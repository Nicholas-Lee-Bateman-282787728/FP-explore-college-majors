8557710,3,B00ATV2D5U,"I had ordered this product thinking that I was getting a copy of another program by the same name that I had seen on VHS. The other program was at least three times longer and consisted of a presentation that Bruce Lipton had done at an earlier date than the program on the DVD. I should have examined this product more closely before ordering it as it wasn't what I was hoping to buy.

This product on DVD is an interview between Bruce Lipton and the host of the TV program, ""A Better World"", about Lipton's book ""The Biology of Belief"". The interview examines the basic ideas of ""The Biology of Belief""  but due to time limitations does not go into depth the way the older VHS program did that I mentioned above. This product provides a basic introduction to the ideas that Bruce Lipton sets forth in the book and acts as a ""teaser"" to the book itself.",1397606400,3,854,4.364779874213837
