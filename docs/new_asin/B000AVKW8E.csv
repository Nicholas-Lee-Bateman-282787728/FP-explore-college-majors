8079966,5,B000AVKW8E,"This movie is one of my very favorite films.  And to top it off the music is Morricone.  Nothing is better than Morricone.  This needs to be done blu ray and restored and whatever it takes to make it the highest quality video and audio imaginable.  In any case, get the dvd even if you need to shell out the bucks for an all regional player.  What should be done is they should re release it for USA region.  The movie is actually a mystery although it doesn't start out that way.  It is, after all, a European product and perhaps an American movie maker might have approached it differently but if you like the European approach, then you will like it as is.  I bought it, and an all region player at the same time, mostly because I had heard some of the sound track and that was enough to convince me to buy it.  I will be viewing it often.",1332979200,,842,4.148148148148148
