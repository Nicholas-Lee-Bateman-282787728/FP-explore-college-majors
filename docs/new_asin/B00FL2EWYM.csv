5998654,4,B00FL2EWYM,"This 100-minute French film covers some key moments in the friendship of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger and Pope John Paul II, who appointed the Jewish convert-priest as archbishop of Paris and his close adviser during the 1980s. The real-life Lustiger, who converted to Catholicism at age 14 and whose entire family except for his dad was killed at Auschwitz, died in 2007.

Lustiger, a Catholic prelate who considered himself both Jewish and Christian in a vague way that sometimes offended members of both faiths, makes an intriguing subject for a film. As played by Laurent Lucas, he seethes with anti-authoritarian anger and wild energy, expertly corralled in service of John Paul II's anti-communist realpolitik. There are a few unexpectedly quirky and fun scenes in this movie, which depicts JPII as an iron-willed politician who was at the same time not above wearing white sneakers and jumping into a swimming pool he had constructed at his Castel Gandalfo vacation residence. The offbeat depiction of the Polish pontiff, suggesting the humor and spontaneity behind his public persona, is a highlight of this film as it convincingly humanizes the recently-sainted John Paul II in the early years of his papacy. Many of the fictionalized private scenes between Lustiger and JPII crackle with creative energy.

Unfortunately, the film fails to maintain that fresh vibe throughout, ending up as good rather than great because of its uneven plotting. After setting up Lustiger's rise in the church hierarchy, it settles down into a one-issue plot about the controversial presence of a Carmelite convent in Auschwitz under the Communist Polish regime, ignoring nearly all other aspects of his ecclesiastical biography. Character motivations are left vague, but the film suggests JPII allowed the convent to stay there for years as a symbol of resistance to the Communists, only ordering its 1993 transfer as an olive branch to Judaism after the Iron Curtain was torn down. Like many European films, these developments are handled in the talkiest fashion possible, as the film tells more than it shows.

Rather than gaining momentum, the film gradually slows to a crawl as the episodic narrative stops in Auschwitz. As a throwaway, the screenplay implies at one point that Lustiger personally convinced JPII to visit the Holy Land in 2000, and there are so many of these loaded and over-simplified statements that the movie's version of history starts to feel vaguely suspect after awhile. The movie also has an unfortunate tendency to alternate moments of self-righteous sincerity (Lucas lacks the gravitas to make Lustiger's inner turmoil entirely accessible to viewers) with cartoonish melodrama, as when a group of Catholic schismatics loyal to Marcel Lefebvre burst into a Parisian church where they start taunting Lustiger with crude anti-Semitic slurs.

Overall, I recommend giving the film a look, as it rises to some great moments when it focuses on Lustiger's struggle to be both Catholic and Jewish, but it's not the most memorable thing you'll ever see. The DVD is fortunately loaded with great trailers and extras, including an Israeli short film, to keep one engaged. If you're interested in learning about a religious leader who tried to live in two different faith worlds, you'll probably enjoy it, even if you'll be rolling your eyes at it in spots.",1401235200,28,3367,5.195211786372007
5998655,5,B00FL2EWYM,"According to direct Ilan Duran Cohen in response to his drive for bring the true story of Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger to film, Cohen stated,'Lustiger was always emphatic about his duel identity. In an early interview as Archbishop, he said, ""I was born Jewish, and so I remain, even if that is unacceptable for many. For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope and I believe that Christianity is the means for achieving it.""Lustiger was a champion of interfaith dialogue and ""The Jewish Cardinal"" explores these intricacies of balancing faith, family and identity. In a scene in which nuns settle to build a convent within the walls of Auschwitz (where his mother died in 1943), his Jewishness comes most sharply to the fore and Lustiger finds himself a mediator between the two communities.'

A bit of factual data: Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger 17 September 1926 - 5 August 2007 was a French cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was Archbishop of Paris from 1981 until his resignation in 2005. He was created cardinal in 1983 by Pope John Paul II. Lustiger was born Aaron Lustiger in Paris, to a Jewish family. His parents, Charles and Gis&egrave;le Lustiger, were Ashkenazi Jews from Bdzin, Poland, and had left Poland around World War I. Lustiger's father ran a hosiery shop. Aaron Lustiger studied at the Lyc&eacute;e Montaigne in Paris, where he first encountered anti-Semitism. Visiting Germany in 1937, he was hosted by an anti-Nazi Protestant family whose children had been required to join the Hitler Youth. Sometime between the ages of ten and twelve, Lustiger came across a Protestant Bible and felt inexplicably attracted to it. On the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 the family moved to Orl&eacute;ans. In March 1940, during Holy Week, the 13-year old Lustiger decided to convert to Roman Catholicism. On 21 August he was baptized as Aaron Jean-Marie by the Bishop of Orl&eacute;ans, Jules Marie Courcoux. His sister converted later. In October 1940, the Vichy regime passed the first Statute on Jews, which forced Jews to wear a yellow badge. Although Jean-Marie Lustiger lived hidden in Orl&eacute;ans, his parents had to wear the badge. Lustiger, his father and sister sought refuge in unoccupied southern France, while his mother returned to Paris to run the family business. In September 1942, his mother was deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp where she died the following year. The surviving family returned to Paris after the war. Lustiger's father tried unsuccessfully to have his son's baptism annulled, and even sought the help of the chief rabbi of Paris.

Written by director Cohen and Chantal Derudder, THE JEWISH CARDINAL relates the true story of Jean-Marie Lustiger (Laurent Lucas) the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who maintained his cultural identity as a Jew even after converting to Catholicism at a young age, later joining the priesthood. Quickly rising within the ranks of the Church; Lustiger was appointed Archbishop of Paris by Pope Jean Paul II (Aurelien Recoing) - and found a new platform to celebrate his dual identity as a Catholic Jew; earning him both friends and enemies from either group. When Carmelite nuns settle down to build a convent within the cursed walls of Auschwitz, Lustiger found himself a mediator between the two communities - and may be forced at last to choose his side.

The acting and the setting and the glorious musical scoring enhance this little film well. It is a powerful film to experience not only because of the quality of craftsmanship that produced it, but also because of the profound message the film's subject offers for consideration. We are all one. Grady Harp, May 14",1400976000,7,3719,5.04390243902439
5998656,5,B00FL2EWYM,"This French film with English subtitles is the true story of Jean-Marie, Cardinal Lustiger, who was born Jewish in France in 1926.  After the German invasion of France in 1940 he converted to Roman Catholicism against the wishes of his parents and eventually joined the priesthood.  Rising quickly in the Church hierarchy, he was eventually made an archbishop by Pope John Paul II.  His dual heritage meant that some distrusted him while others saw in him an opportunity to bridge religious and cultural divides. Lustiger himself was conflicted over his role as an obedient son of the Church who remained attached to his Jewish heritage.  The Jewish Cardinal is a superb film which ably depicts Lustiger's struggles.

The film begins with Lustiger's appointment as Bishop of Orleans in 1979.  We see his reaction as well as those of his widowed father (his mother died in Auschwitz)and other family members as friends.  There are some excellent scenes depicting Lustiger's meetings with Pope John Paul II, in which many of his inner misgivings about his role surface.  These misgivings continue through the rest of the film, during which we observe Lustiger's roles in such controversies as the planned construction of a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz and the canonization of Holocaust victim Edith Stein.  It is not entirely clear by the end of the film that Lustiger ever fully resolved his inner conflict, but viewers are left with a strong sense of admiration for him.",1400198400,48,1472,5.049586776859504

5998672,5,B00FL2EWYM,"Absolute monarchy, JPII, Jewish rabbis, religious conflict, faith and hope. Not just the story of a Catholic priest and bishop, a magnificent human drama. Excellent actors. Especially, the portrayal of Pope John Paul II and his interaction with the bishop was excellent. They were brothers in the faith, but superior and inferior in rank. And Pope JPII was focused on fighting communism, while the Jewish Cardinal was focused on problems arising from thousands of years of culture and history. From this difference in viewpoint arises the captivating story. Catholic tradition and what seems like common sense to Catholics does not always line up with what is traditional and commonsensical for Jewish people. The Cardinal tried to represent both communities.
This movie makes one think about what the meaning of one's identity is.",1488153600,,831,5.303030303030303
5998673,4,B00FL2EWYM,"This made-for-French-TV film shows the adult life of Jean-Marie Aaron lustiger.  He was born in 1926 in France to Polish Jewish immigrants who ran a hosiery shop.  With WWII his father got him into a catholic family to hide him.  The mother was picked up and died in a camp and the father and sister survived.  Age 14 he decided to be baptized as a Catholic and then studied at the Sorbonne before completing seminary and getting ordained.

This film is very well
Done in showing 1980's Paris and Orleans and Rome. He is made a a bishop, then archbishop
And finally a cardinal. by john Paul II. He is temperamental and smart, engaging and determined.  Invited to the Vatican, he becomes an advisor to the Polish pope.

This film was not widely distributed in USA but was popular at Jewish film festivals because of the controversy of this Lustiger's conversion.  His father never accepted it. He himself maintained that he was both Jewish and Christian.  This angered both sides.

When in Aischwitz the local nuns built a chapel to honor the many Catholic dead, the controversy grew very heated and JPII got Lustiger involved.  Since his own mother hat died there, he was for closing the convent and chapel because the Jews had been so many more victims there.  I would say that this is the part of the film not well done.  Most of us can only vaguely remember this controversy if at all.

There is one point that Lustiger makes:only one building at the camp is dedicated to the Jews.

I visited there myself in 1985. Under the Communists, all occupied East Bloc countries were declared anti-fascist.  These many WWII camps were used by the communists for about five years to lock up anti communists right after the war.  They were often in complete disrepair or burnt down because of typhus and other diseases.  So wooden barracks were mostly gone. Then they became museums of Anti-fascism and school kids were brought there.

Auschwitz near Krakow was full of long rows of brick buildings, mostly empty.  Sixteen nations had had their victims sent there, so sixteen buildings were each showing their own way of memorialing their dead. I remember the Yugoslavian one in particular which simply mounted photos of all the victims taken that one day of arrival as photographed with heads shaven and striped uniforms given. You could match up sons and daughters and fathers and sons all over the room.  Visitors spent a lot of time in that building.  The reality of individuals was there.

Finally there was one building for Israel, a country which of course did not yet exist in WWII.  That one simply had an eternal flame in the middle of the floor.  Rather dull, so most visitors carried on.

Why the film would not clarify this, I don't know.  It was very effective in showing the incredible wide range of control and murder the Nazis had.  Each nation included Jews as their people.

Some people found a visit to auschwitz a moving experience.  I found it dull and lifeless in 1985.  If someone were not familiar through books and films of that period, they would leave disappoint ed. If you have ever seen old warehouses in a long row abandoned---that is what you were visiting.

I recommend the film for those interested in catholicism's fight for survival in this modern age.",1487203200,,3280,4.710017574692443

These interactions convey a sense that JP II is merely a clever, talented, self promoter moving about creatively in a church that is at least a step too slow.  I realize that the Church actually has such men participating in a similar ambitious dance that our current Pope Francis disparagingly calls ""clericalism"", but I am put off by the implications that JP II is such a person.

5998769,5,B00FL2EWYM,"The other reviewers have written very worthwhile reviews.
This is certainly an excellent movie.
For me, I would only like to touch on one seemingly tragic theme that the movie brings out so clearly.
This is the question of what to do about a broken relationship between father and son.
Can it be repaired?
Is it beyond hope?
It is certainly a relevant theme in our society - especially in prisons where so many inmates hate their fathers for so many reasons.
The prophet Malachi touches on this same theme in the very last verse of his prophecy (Malachi 4:6) saying that the coming prophet Elijah would turn the hearts of the fathers back to the sons (or, since ""sons"" is plural, he might have meant ""children"" thereby including daughters, too) and the hearts of the sons/children back to their fathers.
The movie shows us that the father-son relationship had been broken by more than one thing.
Sure, there was the conversion to Christianity, of course.
But there was also the loss of the mother to the concentration camp.
The son as a child had bitterly blamed his father for this.
Now with his father lying on his deathbed, the two of them bring up the matter once again.
The father once again reaffirms that he had done all he could, all he knew to do.
We believe him!
The son, rather than apologizing for the years of pain he had caused his father by unjustly blaming him, merely says, ""I was young then.""
We cry to watch the scene - a father dying in grief and a young well-accomplished bishop who seemingly does not feel any of his father's pain.
I have been in that scene myself - but for me, I told my dad, ""I was so stupid!"" - and he accepted my explanation and it concluded the matter forever, bringing us together.
Oh! Truly great acting in both of these key roles brings us to this point.
The same tragic flaw carries over to his relationship with Pope John Paul II.
The pope promotes him to great honor.
Yet he constantly has to put out the fires the young hothead inflames and eventually has to distance himself from him.
We want so much for the story to conclude with the young bishop becoming the next pope.
But the ability to reconcile people to each other - certainly the most needed quality of any pope - seems to be just beyond grasp.
We know, beyond the end of the movie, that death by cancer claimed the young bishop before his time.
And the world has lost a great man.
His father was justly proud of him.

5998800,5,B00FL2EWYM,"My review is really directed towards Catholics.

As a convert to Catholicism I must confess that my own self understanding is that the Church is the true Israel. It the body of the New Exodus where all the tribes of Israel have been gathered back together along with the gentiles. Thus fulfilling the promise of the Kingdom of David which moved Israel from a national cult at Sinai to the truly international kingdom of Zion. Rabbinic Judaism, which is the Judaism that developed after the destruction of the second temple in 70 A.D can from this perspective be thought of as a proto-Protestation.

This movie was very enlightening to me because I had not realized the extent to which a worldly anti-Semitism existed in places like France even just 50 years ago. This is almost inexplicable to me because as a Catholic I fully understand myself, a Semite, i.e. as someone who traces their family, through covenant--not birth, to Noah's son Shem who received his father's priestly birthright. That the political situation could be such that a French Catholic Bishop could feel it impossible to say Kaddish at his father's funeral is absolutely amazing to me. It must be understood that this type of worldly anti-Semitism, belongs to just that: the world. Like ancient Israel the Church is full of frail, sinful people. This sin however is never a reflection of Israel, itself, but the world that surrounds her. The Church has never been--and cannot be by virtue of logical self-contradiction, anti-Semitic, and when individual Catholics are they have gravely sinned.

I am tempted to say we've come a long way in these last 50 years, but I think this is actually wrong. Misguided ecumenicalism is just the same error in the other direction, and a lot of the Church's openness to Judaism today is predicated on such ecumenicalism and not a thorough and deep understanding of the implications of Catholic (Christian) theology. What we have to understand as Catholics is the more profound logical conclusions of our faith and express these to our co-religionists and separated brethren. This still remains an inter-family disagreement over the nature of who we are as a family, Israel. Catholics believe the Davidic Kingdom has already been restored, Rabbinical Jews don't.

Catholics have always been in truth Semites, which is to say spiritually Semite because that is the only way any of us are Semites. We are sons of Abraham not through the flesh but by the word of a promise. What this film illustrates is how such simple Catholic Orthodoxy is often, even to this day, just as simply missed.

As a priest Jean-Marie Aaron Lustiger would have had to pray some Breviary daily. The public prayer of the Church remains fundamentally Jewish as the Breviary--for those who might not know--is little more than just the Psalms themselves (and all the theology above comes from simply praying the Psalms). Even after seeing this film I can hardly understand the mindset which could lead a Bishop to find saying Kaddish for his father controversial, as the Kaddish is to some real extent also a prayer of the Church. What this points out to me is the crisis of Catholicism in the modern age, more specifically during St. John Paul II Papacy in those critical first years after Vatican II. If this movie is accurate then the Catholic Church in France--as elsewhere--had long ago descended into an ignorance about itself. Here it is amazing to note the operation of grace in the world, which plays out despite ourselves, where a then Aaron Lustiger experienced a vision of faith that ultimately escaped his own intellectual grasp even as he struggled later in life to realize conceptually as a Cardinal what he had already come to know spiritually while still a teenager. In other words this grace lead him as a child to a conversion into a faith he seemed to only dimly understand even after he served as one of its leaders. Such grace we Catholics believe exists in the world through the Church. Despite our own shortcomings and no matter how one may feel about the Catholic Church or what one may believe, it remains, in reality the portal by which grace enters the world, period--a grace that we perceive, at best, only through a glass, darkly, even while it operates openly in our lives.

Of course above I am speaking more of the the simple minded way he is presented in the movie than of the actual man, himself. In fact along these lines we should disabuse ourselves of the modernist notion of progress in the Church which seems to have always been caught in the riptide of  conflict that both understands it profound truths and those which mistake them. This strikes me as one the most profound if subtle proofs that the Catholic Church is really what she claims to be as there seems to always and everywhere be a force operation in opposition to grace which seeks to obscure and otherwise confuse the reality of the Church, even as the Church itself has steadily found a more precise and complete formula for the communication of that reality.

It is a good film and if you are a Catholic you should watch it.

P.S. since writing this review I have had the chance to do a lot more reading and thinking. I must say that some of my expressed opinions above are manifestly wrong. What we think of Judaism today is actually more properly called Rabbinical Judaism and is an offshoot Phrasieeism. It was formed as an independent religion sometime between the first and second Roman Jewish Wars, which is to say sometime between 70 A.D and 132 A.D. In effect then it is a latter religion than Christianity. Although both religions can be thought of as reformed Jewish sects.  I would subsequently also classify it as proto-Protestantism (in fact the first Protestant movement). For myself I haven't yet completely worked out theology as what degree or not degree it is yoked to the Church as the degree that any Protestantism is still yoked to the Church is an open theological question within Catholicism.",1425772800,,6000,4.81086323957323

5998803,4,B00FL2EWYM,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I am Catholic and have always lived in a multi cultural Jewish neighborhood and had many discussions on religion and the blending of families today. Some families are very bitter with children changing faith, others happy they embrace something with all their heart and soul, in a way they might not. The biggest heartaches seem to be when change of religion is for convenience, to make things easier in a new marriage. I've been close to this myself. There is not always a black/white view, we can't always label things. This movie shows that well.

I enjoyed watching this complex and faith-filled man, Jean-Marie Lustiger start and finish his journey with us and although not perfect, it showed his triumphs and trials very well.

I found his epitaph very moving which is on his crypt at Notre Dame Cathedral :

I was born Jewish.
I received the name
Of my paternal grandfather, Aaron
Having become Christian
By faith and by Baptism,
I have remained Jewish
As did the Apostles.
I have as my patron saints
Aaron the High Priest,
Saint John the Apostle,
Holy Mary full of grace.
Named 139th archbishop of Paris
by His Holiness Pope John Paul II,
I was enthroned in this Cathedral
on 27 February 1981,
And here I exercised my entire ministry.
Passers-by, pray for me.

 Aaron Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger
Archbishop of Paris",1420934400,6,1356,4.777777777777778
5998804,5,B00FL2EWYM,"A French film that depicts the life of Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger, ""The Jewish Cardinal"" focuses on his last 28 years (1979-2007), with flashbacks to his early family life. Minding his own business as a parish priest, Lustger is catapulted into prominence when Pope John Paul II elevates him to Bishop of Orleans and, soon after, Archbishop of Paris. Lustiger's dual identity as both a Jew and a Catholic leader can no longer be contained and he often runs afoul of both camps. Gradually, he assimilates the agile gravitas of JP2 and becomes one of his closest advisers (along with Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI). I especially enjoyed the scenes of Lustiger with JP2, because they reminded me of why I admired JP2 so much. Vigorous and passionate, the great Pope could step on people's toes (as did Lustiger), but was flexible enough to listen and sometimes be persuaded. The movie played this out well when Lustiger repeatedly tries to get JP2 to order the transfer of a community of Carmelite nuns devoted to St. Edith Stein from the grounds of the Auschwitz death camp (where Stein, a Jew, was murdered).

Also touching were the scenes of Lustiger with his cousin and especially with his father, Charles, a secular Jew who struggled mightily over his son's conversion and meteoric rise within the Catholic Church. Jean-Marie never fully reconciled with his father, most likely because he experienced many of the same struggles. Losing his mother, Gisele Lustiger, at Aushchwitz had just about everything to do with it and visiting Auschwitz brought this out. By the end, Lustiger mellows as he serves out his term in Paris and dies two years after his Petrine mentor. In the film, JP2 reminds Lustiger of his papabile status (favorability to be elected pope), but a quick check of Wikipedia informed me that Lustiger disavowed any interest whatsoever in the papacy. ""The Jewish Cardinal"" gets a bit melodramatic at times, in my opinion, but still is worthy of a five star rating. Fr. Dennis",1420761600,,2004,4.928994082840236

5998817,3,B00FL2EWYM,"I found it interesting to learn the story of the engaging Cardinal of Paris through this film.  It was a moving account of Jean Lustiger's life and the struggles he faced as a convert from Judaism, especially in his relationship with his father. By contrast, the film's portrayal of Pope John Paul II was somewhat cartoonish -- both inaccurate and overplayed.  I know people who were close to John Paul, and he was never known to slam his fists down in response to Communism, or to see it as the only obstacle to freedom to be defeated.  He lived through the cruelty of the Nazi regime which unleashed its brutality upon the Polish people in a particularly cruel manner, killing 6 million Poles in total, half of whom were Gentiles.

Hitler gave explicit permission to his commanders before the invasion to kill ""without pity or mercy, all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language,"" and Himmler stated in 1940, ""It is imperative that the great German nation considers the elimination of all Polish people as its chief task."" Some 1,700 Polish priests were sent to Dachau, half of whom died there.  (One of the ways Nazis tortured them included sending guard dogs to bite off their genitals.)  The final total of Polish priests killed by the Nazis was 1,811 overall.  Karol Wotiyja risked his life studying for the priesthood during the Nazi occupation in a clandestine seminary and lost a number of friends to the Nazis. He was well aware of the horrific treatment of the Jews and would not have belittled anything about it.

It is interesting, however, that film after film has been made about the horrors of Nazism and a very few (at least here in the U.S.) about the Soviet treatment of its ethnic peoples and those in its occupied countries.  On the orders of Lenin, 10 million Russians were killed at the inception of the Soviet State for resisting. When the Ukrainians held out, Stalin and his cohorts launched a mass starvation campaign in the winter of 1932/33, ordering all grain and other food supplies to be removed from the region.  Even children were shot for trying to board trains to go into the cities to buy bread, while the stolen grain was exported in record numbers to the West.  People half dead from starvation were buried alive in mass graves.  7 million Ukrainians were starved to death in one year. And that was only the beginning.

I recommend watching the documentary ""The Soviet Story"" on Amazon.  It is one of the few times the truth about the devastation caused by Marxist dogma has been told.  Maybe Pope John Paul II knew more about it than those of us in comfortable democracies are willing to concede in our love affair with radical egalitarianism.",1411603200,22,2696,4.706382978723404

5998831,5,B00FL2EWYM,"I was unfamiliar with the story of Jean-Marie Lustiger before watching this movie, and so will start with the disclaimer that I am accepting the depiction of events as presented in this movie as accurate.

The movie opens in 1979, as Lustiger learns he will be appointed as the new Bishop of Orleans by Pope John Paul II. Director Ilan Cohen uses this milestone to begin presenting Lustiger's backstory. Born Aaron Lustiger to a Jewish family in Paris, his 1940 conversion to Catholicism and his Jewish ancestry become shared points of tension for Lustiger, and his relationships with his father, with his cousin, with the Pope and with himself as the movie unfolds.

After serving as a bishop for slightly more than a year, Lustiger is promoted again, and becomes the Archbishop of Paris in early 1981. He also develops a close relationship with Pope John Paul II. The two share confidences, to include the Pope's assessment that Lustiger may be a future successor to the papacy.

The movie focuses on these areas:
-the strains in Lustiger's relationship with his father, who resists acceptance of his son's conversion...through the end of his life.
-the tension between the high profile of a converted Jew and the French Jewish community
-the relationship between Lustiger and Pope John Paul
-the role of the Catholic church in attempting to reconcile the history of Holocaust denial in Poland (both by Catholics and during the eventual politicization of the Holocaust by the pre-Solidarity Communists ruling Poland).

While the final half of the film gets overly involved in the details of a community of Carmelite nuns establishing a convent adjacent to Auschwitz, this provides an opportunity to convey the complicated fabric of spiritual, political and historical forces bearing down on both Lustiger and the Pope.

Wonderfully acted and superbly written. You don't  need to be Catholic or Jewish to appreciate this story; you just need an interest in what happens when even the most faithful supplicants are tested by strong forces.

It shows the negative reaction of many who refuse to open their mind and the understanding of those who are much more in tune to what a faith is, and all the benefits and enlightenment it procures.
The religious ""bipolar"" problem is very well presented and felt throughout the movie. I wished the name of the actors were visible and readable on the cover as well....they deserve it. Although this is not a masterpiece of a film, it does help open one's mind on religious situations. This film is an eye opener, and primarily a mind opener as well.

5998835,4,B00FL2EWYM,"This movie is a moving and enlightening look at how the consequences of one man's personal faith experience affect not only his own life and his family's connection but also the public around him. A beautiful faith experience becomes a profound burden because we make the chooser the carrier of our collective agendas and conflicts whether he wants it or not. The challenge for the human at the center of this story is how to transcend the rest of us.

As a 14 year old, a young Jewish boy under the pressure of family separation and personal danger finds a deep sense of peace in a Catholic church. The experience is so profound it changes everything about his life, except his sense of himself as a Jew. While he later converts and joins the priesthood on the basis of the power of that experience, his clarity about his own identity never waivers and that is part of what makes this story special. The young man probably anticipated that his private moment of decision would have profound family consequences. But as this film shows, his ""private"" decision never stopped echoing publicly and in time. In addition to the personal and family consequences driven by his experience of faith, the decision to convert and join the priesthood took on a public meaning with conservative Catholics and a collective meaning for Jews concerned with how the conversion could be played against their community. These were reactions the youngster obviously never anticipated but that the human being has to deal with his entire life.

That could be considered the story of how he responds to the negative side of his choice. Against that there is the fact that his personal uniqueness leads to him being present with the right history and influence at just the right moment to deal with what could have become (at the very least) a disturbing challenge to his mother's memory and that of other Jews lost in the holocast. That is a story often found in Jewish history, whether it is the story of Moses or the story of Esther: the Jew who does not forget his or her origins and is positioned as if by magic -- or God -- to serve their people when they are needed. It's a perspective his people hadn't considered but I found it a powerful subtext in the film if one asks, 'why him, why at that time and place?' It's what makes this a film well worth seeing by Christians, Jews, and people who believe in the power of the spirit.",1405728000,2,2414,4.611627906976744

5998852,4,B00FL2EWYM,"I really was not expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did. It is a compelling story that reflects upon the possibility of different religion coexisting together, even inside a single man, and how we construct our identities in face of our origins, choices and obligations. Its well acted by the whole cast, but the performance of Aurelien Recoing playing a playful, full of life Pope Jean-Paul II was the highlight for me. Recommended also to those not really interested in religious matters.",1403654400,3,497,4.858823529411764

5998855,4,B00FL2EWYM,"Based on the real life story of Jean-Marie Lustiger; a man born to Jewish parents who converted, when he was fourteen, to the Church of Rome. He went on to become a priest in Paris and was then spotted by Pope John Paul II as a rising star who could help invigorate the faith of the French people.

He had lost his mother to the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau and his father could not reconcile that his son had turned his back on Judaism. Seen as an apostate by some Jews and a good advert for Catholicism by the Pope he had to struggle with his internal demons. This is compounded when he reaches the lofty heights of Cardinal and gets embroiled in the politics of the former Eastern Union with its Soviet masters.

This is a very well made film, stunning performances abound with Aurlien Recoing (`Blue is the warmest colour') putting in a convincing performance of the Pope. Though this was actually a made for TV French film, it still has extremely high production values and good attention to period detail. It is a thoughtful, well observed and fairly well balanced view of a man whose life was anything but ordinary. Grgoire Leprince-Ringuet as Father Julien is brilliant too but I have a soft spot for him after his performances in `The Snows of Kilimanjaro' and `The Mysteries of Lisbon'. This was a review copy from Film Movement and also contains a short `Kosher' from director Isabelle Stead and an excellent biography of Jean-Marie too. - an easy one to recommend.",1402099200,2,1482,4.6311787072243344
5998856,4,B00FL2EWYM,"Director Ilan Duran Cohen brings us the true story of Jean-Marie Lustiger in his film, The Jewish Cardinal.

Film Movement consistently brings award winners to the small screen and this film is no exception - it's an official selection of numerous film festivals.

 Lustiger was born a Jew in 1926 Poland. He converted to Catholicism at age 14. His mother was killed at Auschwitz in 1942. He rose in the ranks of the church and had the ear of Pope John Paul II.

 Bare bones synopsis. And they're simply facts. Cohen brings this amazing man's life to....well, life.

 Lustiger struggled with remaining true to his heritage, while embracing his faith. His dual 'roles' were both despised and embraced within the Church. The confrontation between the Jews and Catholics over Auschwitz and Lustiger's involvement was powerful. And enlightening - I was unaware of this piece of history.

Laurent Lucas was brilliant as Cohen, more than aptly portraying Lustiger's enthusiasm, strength, faith,conflict and more. The supporting case was just as wonderful, especially Aurelien Recoing as John Paul. The scenes between these two gave an intimate view of their relationship. And a 'human' view of these two men.

 To be quite honest, I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did. I tend to shy away from religious films. But The Jewish Cardinal was not specifically about doctrine. Instead it brings to light both an important piece of history and the life of a complicated man. I was engaged from start to finish.

 (The sound track was quite beautiful as well)

 As, always Film Movement includes a short with their DVD. This time it's an nine minute film called Kosher from director Isabelle Stead. The tie in to the main film is obvious. It's about a lonely young Jewish boy finding a pig - and keeping it for a pet. The viewer is left to make their own inferences as there is no dialogue.",1402012800,2,1892,4.781538461538462
5998857,5,B00FL2EWYM,"Directed by Ilan Duran Cohen, ""The Jewish Cardinal"" is based upon the life of Aaron Jean-Marie Lustiger (1926 -- 2007) who late in this film refers to himself as ""God's Mixed Child"". Lustiger was born Jewish but at age of 14 converted to Catholicism after a strong religious experience. He became a priest and rose in the Church when Pope John Paul II appointed him in succession Bishop of Orleans, Archbishop of Paris, and Cardinal. Lustiger enjoyed a close relationship with Pope John Paul II and advised him on many occasions on important matters.

In French with English subtitles, ""The Jewish Cardinal"" offers a moving portrayal of Lustiger, focusing on his difficult position, to himself and others, as ""God's mixed child"". The film begins with his elevation to Bishop in 1979 and proceeds forward in time with many flashbacks to Lustiger's youth. As a child, Lustiger experienced violent anti-Semitism first hand during a stay as an exchange student in Berlin in the late 1930s.  Lustiger's mother had been killed at Auschwitz. His relationship with his non-religious father was strained at best. At the end of WW II, his father tried unsuccessfully to get his son's early conversion annulled. Elements of the Catholic Church opposed Lustiger's elevation.  A passionate man, Lustiger describes himself many times in strongly Jewish terms as, for example, ""born Jewish, and so I remain.""  The film also portrays him as devoted to his Catholicism and to the Church.

The movie gradually develops a focus on Lustiger's role in defusing controversy over the establishment of a convent for Carmelite nuns in the mid-1980s. Many found the convent offensive to the memory of the Jews murdered at the camp. Lustiger visited the camp and was overcome with the memory of his mother. The film shows his torment when he could pray neither as a Jew nor as a Christian. Lustiger worked with an initially hostile Polish Cardinal and with negotiators for the Jewish community. After substantial difficulty he helped persuade Pope John Paul II to close and move the convent.

The movie is convincingly acted and filmed with the strongest scenes between Lustiger (Laurent Lucas) and the Polish-born Pope (Aurelien Recoing). The recently canonized John Paul II receives a sympathetic presentation, showing his religious devotion, political sensitivities, and genuine friendship with Lustiger, with the two sometimes arguing, but also having swimming races and joking. The film has an appropriate, beautiful musical score which includes music from Schubert and Gluck.

The film poignantly shows an individual firm in his Catholic convictions who continued to identify with the Judaism of his birth. The situation could only produce strong internal turmoil. I learned from getting to know Cardinal Lustiger through this film.  The movie will appeal to viewers with a strong interest in religious questions, whether they are believers in a faith, of mixed faith, or of questioning, ambivalent faith.  In the modern world, there are many ways to be ""God's mixed child"".

8616600,1,B00FL2EWYM,"The history of Poland is so complex that it is hard to understand. Because it is between two dominant countries it has been taken over for it's rich agriculture . It disappeared from the map when it was divided up between Germany and Russia. But back in the 12th century when the Jewish people were expelled from other countries, Poland gave them a home. Poland was Catholic and they thought handling money would lead to sin , this is the history of why a lot of Jewish people became bankers and merchants. The first thing Hitler did after invading Poland was to kill the wealthy and educated Poles. Then internment camps were built and the Jewish population were inturned, as well as about the same amount of Polish.  When the war was over the Jews were given a country and Poland was given to Russia! President Roosevelt was dying and did not stand up for Poland, he said that this was a grave injustice, but had no fight left in him. The Catholic church existed under the communist radar. I am sure the Nuns were not disrespecting the history of Auschwitz, but if there was a building standing that they could put to good use, they would use it . So to understand the undertones that this movie proposes just go to Wikipedia and read a brief history of Poland and the Jews in Poland. Also read about Pope John Paul II's life.  A closer look at facts will make you wonder what the author of the book was trying to resolve in his own life.",1502582400,3,1440,4.409774436090226

8616604,4,B00FL2EWYM,"..and illustrative of one of humanity's most peculiar predilections.  Of the things that have plagued our species, religion I do believe is the worst.  For imaginary gods we have torn families and nations apart.  We have burned our kind at the stake, tortured them beyond imagination, rejected sons and daughters, abandoned lifelong friends, gone to war, destroyed civilizations and wiped away the history of of empires.  We have even been so silly as to chisel away religions carved in stone, several times.  ISIS is doing that now.  We do all that because their imaginary friends were/are different. The way they chose to believe was or is different.  It strikes me as strange that even with so many religions, every religion I ever heard of was the only true religion.  Everyone else is/was wrong.  We cannot create life on any level, yet we'll create gods by the dozens and elaborate ceremonies to appease them.
The first half of this film deals with familial differences in religion, rejection and finally abandonment because of different ways to approach the same god. The same god.  Imagine if it had been a different god.  It dismays me to know this divisivness happens among what would be otherwise cogent and intelligent
people, and is sad commentary on our kind.  The protagonist handles it well, follows his own vision of right and wrong, constantly haunted by a lost mother , a disapproving father, changing times and his own conscience.
The film is well done, esp. for a foreign work, the CC is automatic, the insights are worthwhile.  I wouldn't watch it again, but it is a good one for its genre.",1498780800,,1612,4.839416058394161
