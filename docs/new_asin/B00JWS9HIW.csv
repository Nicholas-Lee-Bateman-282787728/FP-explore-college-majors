6395811,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I watched a special presentation of this film in Fullerton, CA, and I think it was amazing. I learned about this wonderful culture of people who own VW buses, who would come to the rescue of these two crazy guys, trying to get this ""piece of junk"" all the way to California. It was endearing, frustrating, annoying, uplifting, exuberant and much more. I was exhausted by the end, but I really do recommend that you watch this story. We've all been in a situation at least once where you wish someone would come to the rescue. In this real story, a lot of real people stood up and supported this dream and made me remember that there are a lot of good people out there!",1401926400,6,668,4.352
6395812,5,B00JWS9HIW,"""Circle the Wagen"" is a light-hearted documentary about a young man taking on a fool's errand and bringing his friend along for the ride - but as one watches the film you realize the cross-country jaunt is a foil for showcasing the angels of human nature. Patience, altruism, camaraderie and a massive group of disparate people strewn across the world with different lives, goals and dreams brought together to share love, affection and friendship through the ""vehicle"" of a rusty, decrepit bus.

""Circle the Wagen"" is a fun romp that is artfully executed - but it is also a showcase for simple, honest good that is in people when they choose to let it show.",1401753600,7,658,4.721739130434782
6395813,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I had the good fortune of watching the final cut of this film prior to it's release date and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. It's imbued with a sense of whimsy and adventure that is truly infectious. At times hilarious, at times poignant; this is a film that needs to be experienced. Do yourself a favor and buy it!",1401753600,8,322,4.383333333333334
6395814,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I had the honor of attending Circle the Wagen's sold-out world premiere at the Albuquerque Film & Media Experience and loved every moment of it. The VW Beetle limousine and long line of VW buses parked along Central Avenue in front of the Guild Cinema hinted that the movie was going to be something special. It didn't disappoint. You'll start out wondering what kind of nut would buy on eBay, sight unseen, a 1971 Volkswagen bus and try to drive it halfway across the country to get it home. But, it won't take you long to be glad that he did. You'll smile when you hear the distinctive sound of the air-cooled motor roaring to life and cringe each time it inevitably dies. You'll laugh at Dave's and Charlie's hapless attempts to get just a few more miles down the road. And, you'll cheer when the VW faithful come to the rescue, helping a couple of guys they had never even met before the journey began. So, if you love old Volkswagens or ever had a hare-brained idea, been stranded beside the road, or blessed by the kindness of strangers, then Circle the Wagen has something for you.",1401753600,8,1088,4.5

6395842,4,B00JWS9HIW,"Let me just preface this by saying that I have always been a sucker for cross-country adventure journey films, and if you combine that with my childhood dream of someday owning a VW bus, I couldn't help but enjoy ""Circle the Wagen."" The main two characters whom the story centers around are a very likable duo and you find yourself almost immediately rooting for them and their undertaking (which borders on the insane). Riding in the backseat with them on their trip to bring home a rust-bucket beauty of a vehicle, you are treated to some of the finer aspects of humanity as they are in constant need of assistance from strangers, as well as a look into the fascinating world of underground VW fanatics, who are truly a free-spirited and wonderful subculture of humans. I would definitely suggest this movie if you're looking for an uplifting jaunt across America, and especially if you have even the remotest appreciation for anything VW.",1427587200,,941,4.814814814814815

6395856,5,B00JWS9HIW,"Fun, independent production or ""Indie"" film for the VW diehards, hobbiests, and infatuated VW Bus owners...past or present.  DVD product arrived quickly and well-packaged, using minimal, environmentally-responsible, packaging.  Basicstory covers an extended time period, shows interactions and pride-of-ownership scenes between/ among VW Bus owners who are primarily located in the Western US.  Production uses chronologically-staged scenes and human interactions that demonstrate and try to present pride and passion for an iconic product and its symbolic durability.  Not the Hippie or Flower power version one might anticipate from the title; a solid, well-constructed film.  Good product, good production, fun to watch, share, and own.

6395857,3,B00JWS9HIW,"This could have been interesting.  But nope.  Just two kids who make it back by completely leaning on other people.  Buy the manual, buy some spare parts, learn a little bit before you get in the damn thing.  Or, alternatively, if no one answers your calls you are screwed.  Maybe a good period piece of typical american youth.  And yeah, I am an old fart and had a 500 bucks van and drove 66 so that is why I watched this movie that is in worse shape than that bus.  Besides, how serious can you take it if the big ass winnebago is following the thing with half a film crew in it.  Also, if that bus runs, and you do 50 miles per hour, not unreasonable on flat ground wouldnt' it take 30 hours to go the distance.

6395862,1,B00JWS9HIW,"Wow. What a disappointment. I came into this film with high hopes--for a long time I've had the dream of buying my own VW bus, so I really wanted to like it. This film came across as completely manufactured and scripted. The two main characters are hipsters from L.A. who know absolutely nothing about cars. I can't say that I know much more, but I wouldn't consider running out of gas or the fact that the main character kept stalling because he couldn't operate the clutch as ""breaking down."" These two guys seem so inauthentic that at points I started to wonder if this film was actually a mockumentary. It was that cheesy. Don't waste your time with this one. All the positive reviews must be from their friends and relatives. Ugh. What a terrible film.",1411948800,,757,4.573529411764706

6395875,1,B00JWS9HIW,"What a gyp. ""Rated"" 5 stars, but that could only be by the guys participating. This is a student film, over-long, self-indulgent, ultimately so so  boring. It's all about a guy who graduated from USC and floated around until he got it into his head that what he needed was a 72 VW Bus. So he buys one for $750 flies to Iowa to pick it up, and the rest of the endless film charts the inconveniences he experiences getting it back to LA. The guy himself is feckless and a little creepy and a real Peter Pan, but the men who help him along the way are the real stars of this ultimately irritating waste of time.",1409616000,2,608,4.1525423728813555

6395878,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I love this movie. I'm not a big fan of reality shows, but this movie shows how, even if you are completely technically challenged, you can by a VW bus, somewhere across the country, and bring it home. It shows the big heart and generosity of the VW scene. It is fun and entertaining, there is no rehearsed scene in it, it is all as it was. Thanks Dave for making the purchase, and Charlie, thanks for the support.",1408492800,,414,4.253164556962025
6395879,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I loved this movie. There is a lot of negative things to complain about in this world and it is good to see good people helping others and making a difference. I strongly identify with this event because I too had a bad experience with a vehicle that even the three stooges could never had dreamed. Remember the adage ""truth is stranger than fiction."" I just wished I could have filmed my experience. I'm sure no one would believe it was true. It was great film. I wished I had known that bus was in Tucumcari I probably passed it several times over the years. I live in Lubbock and have traveled through Tucumcari many times. Now I really want a VW bus.

This was one of my very first kickstarter investments and still believe that it was one of my top 3 after investing in over 300.

6395895,1,B00JWS9HIW,"I thought this documentary was flawed and felt somewhat made-up.  I cant help but watch and wonder why someone would attempt a journey like this and be so completely unprepared..twice. The only reasoning for this that I could come up with is that they were trying to make a good movie, which then means this really isn't anything more than a made up reality TV show. Perhaps my point of view is different than most since I have spent the last few years getting familiar with these cars and people while restoring my 66 Beetle. I just find it somewhat unsettling that people praise the film makers when to me it seems he kind of takes advantage of the generosity of those involved with the network of vw helpers in this film. If you are looking to get a glimpse of the spirit of those who love these vehicles, look around because there are other films out there that capture this much better than Circle the Wagen.",1407456000,3,913,4.467065868263473

You can't help but smile watching that movie! All VW Bus Enthusiasts, and people who just enjoy a good story should watch this amazing film.  It is a feel good story of an adventure that any of us could take, and the good people of this country that are out there willing to help us along the way.",1406764800,,440,4.301204819277109
6395899,5,B00JWS9HIW,"FIRST a note:  Amazon has a policy of combining reviews of ALL formats (theaters,Streaming and DVD and BD) together when providing reviews. MOST of the reviews of this film are from theaters or Streaming. This review is of the DVD with its great bonuses. I always recommend that potential customers sort by ""Newest First"" and then look and see which format is being reviewed. With that sais, on to my review of the DVD version:

Ironically this is one of TWO documentary films about Volkswagen collectors being released this month.  While this one concerns a road trip with the VW ""bus"", the other film on DVD (""The Bus"") is about the car and its history . I'm just getting to that one and will review after I watch it.

But ""Circle The Wagen"" is a wonderful film that seems to have played many regional film festivals and is now getting a well-deserved home video release (in what the packaging calls ""a limited edition""). If I had to sum up the theme of the 86-minute film it would be ""The kindness of strangers"".  It's also a ""buddy film"" and a ""Road trip"" film. When 25 year old Dave Torstenson decides to buy a used VW bus in Iowa and drive it back to his home in Santa Monica, CA, he has no idea how much mechanical trouble he will have. He brings along his ""buddy"" Charlie (definitely a supportive guy) and filmmaker Ryan Steven Green (and a small film crew) to capture what he ""thinks"" will be a fun ride. Well, it isn't - as you will see - but they keep their spirits up as they travel the 1500 miles on the legendary Route 66. There are stops and starts - it actually takes four years to get the VW (nicknamed ""The Croc"") to the west coast. And it took the Director six years from beginning the trip until the film's conclusion.  The Croc takes on a personality of its own and we learn that there are LOTS of VW bus collectors who rally around Dave and Charlie"" to help keep the VW going.
The soundtrack is great and the director uses clever graphics - especially at the beginning - to add to the enjoyment of watching the DVD.
The bonuses are many with an interview with the director (who actually edited the film inside ""The Croc"" - a part of the story I'll let you discover for yourself!) as well as one deleted scene and a slideshow. There is also a full length commentary that I haven't found time to listen to but - based on the personalities of the ""cast"" and Green, I'm expecting it to be fun.

NO, you don't need to have owned a VW - or even ridden in one - to enjoy this film. If you like fictional films about ""road trips"", you'll love this one - and it's true! There are also many interesting facts you'll learn along the way.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6395901,5,B00JWS9HIW,"This film was a treat to view. It chronicles the journey of two friends across the country in a VW bus that was purchased sight-unseen in a dismal state of repair. This film is accessible to people without any knowledge of VWs, so don't think that it is a high-context esoteric experience only enjoyable to the initiated. There are animated sequences that mesh well with the film, and the production value of the entire film is excellent. The director has done an excellent job placing this story in the greater context of VW culture, as well as American society as a whole. I look forward to seeing future works from this filmmaker.",1406419200,,633,4.660714285714286

6395931,5,B00JWS9HIW,"Circle the Wagen is a great doc about a boy and his bus.  It chronicles the journey of a sort of romantic who buys a VW bus on Ebay and attempts to drive it halfway across the country with the help of a nation wide community of VW owners.  Dave and his buddy Charlie suffer through breakdowns and financial roadblocks and are forced to rely on the kindness of strangers in a spectacular real life narrative that reinvigorates the term ""open road.""

There is genuine heart and fun, regret and even despair as the boys are repeatedly thrust into re-assessing the worth of their journey, but the film is as much about finishing what you start as it is enjoying the ride and learning a thing or two along the way.  The road is often used as a metaphor for life and if you've ever felt like your stuck with a croc, this is a journey worth taking.",1403740800,,841,4.30379746835443

6395933,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I posted my review under my friends Amazon account (who apparently used my computer and forgot to sign out...duh), but that gives me the chance to add a second review!

Charlie and Dave form a friendship with the viewer as you travel the route to Los Angeles. The Croc acts as a perfect foil to our two unlikely heroes. As the film travels the lumpy bumpy roads from Ohio to Los Angeles, you form a close bond with the three of them, and get a glimpse of the inside world of the VW community.

Every has a VW story to tell it seems, but there is amongst us a small dedicated band of VW lovers know collectively as The VW Scene! Dave, Charlie and The Croc expose you to this, and after watching the film you'll want to go purchase a VW of your own just to join in the fun!

A stellar experience!

Buy it, you'll enjoy the ride!",1402704000,2,826,4.14375
6395934,5,B00JWS9HIW,"I first heard of this film from one of the lead actors, Charlie. While driving my VW bug to pick up my son from school he flagged me down and told me about the film which had just finished filming. For the next several years I waited with anticipation while they finished editing and producing the project. Then finally, it happened! The DVD was ready!

I watched the film by self, at home with no interruptions. I wanted the ""full"" experience. And what an experience! When the film starts you are almost instantly frustrated with these two ""idiots"" who take on a HUGE task and know virtually nothing about VW's! As the film progresses you begin to have a fondness for Charlie and Dave and their ""adventure"". What can I say, they grow on you like a fungus! As the ""Croc"" finally rolls home you find yourself cheering them on! In the course of a couple of hours they go from irritating guys, to people you genuinely care about. I can think of no greater advertisement or recommendation for a film than that. I ended up caring about Charlie, Dave and The Croc! I wanted them to succeed! And I still do!

If you've seen The Bus movie, or any of the other ""cult classic"" VW films, this one is sure to be one of your favorites. More than an adventure in a vehicle its a film about a relationship wit that vehicle. Any VW owner knows that each and every VW has its own character and the Croc doesn't disappoint!

Get this film, you'll enjoy it. You scream at it, you'll laugh at it, but mostly, you'll care about its protagonists! That makes it a ride worth taking!",1402704000,2,1559,4.387543252595155

I've owned  '62, '63, '64 Beetles, '68 convertable Ghia, '68 Ghia coupe, '64 Ghia Type 34, '65 Baja Beetle and since I've just retired I'm looking for another 1960's air cooled VW.
