4435261,5,B004N1JGI4,"This is a deep Nordic drama, but not the kind that is full of symbolism and hard to understand metaphors. It's a simple tale, often told in many American movies, about the ex-con who gets rejected by society once he is out of prison and pushed back into crime.

What is beautiful to see in this case is how that story is told in a very simple, understated way, in a very Scandinavian style. The actors look natural, more natural than in a ""reality show"" (those don't look real anyway!). All deliver great performances.

Although the style is understated, the story keeps you interested, rooting for the main character. Will he be able to gain independence from the pressures everyone around him put on him? Ultimately, it's a celebration of life and how you can find fulfillment in small things, without needing to ""make a splash"".

It is also quite a lesson on Scandinavian culture.

If you're looking from something different from your usual Hollywood productions, this is a nice change of pace.

P.S.: Why anybody would call this a ""comedy"" or find it ""hilarious"", really, is beyond me... It's about as funny as ""Julia and Julia"" or ""Terminal Man"", to name a couple of examples. If you thought those films were funny, you'll roll down on the floor laughing with this one...",1328572800,,1276,4.7040358744394615
4435262,2,B004N1JGI4,"Who isn't interested in watching a Norwegian-made movie that comes with effusive, over the top, praise blurbs on its cover?
I have to say that I was stoked to see this little treasure in my stocking but I'm sorry to say that the initial buzz and excited anticipation were the biggest bang I got out of this buck.
The problem is that the movie starts off at a very slow jog and loses pace from there.  A part of the problem is that it has the look and feel of an art school project (see also 'Looking for Leonard' same vibe, different look), and sadly, the same level of quality.

What initially kept me engaged about this coming out of prison-falling in with/escaping from former life/colleagues tale is its foreignness:  Norway is a country not oft heard from and who wouldn't be interested in watching such a home grown film under the circumstances?  At first look it was interesting to put words to meaning as I compared dialogue to subtitle; to watch the scenery as it unfolded; and to observe, presumably, typically Norwegian cultural types (no matter how stereotyped) but the voyeuristic novelty soon wears off.

I might have limped through the movie as it plodded to its conclusion but what put me off it and caused me to tune it out was the awful bigotry the movie is fraught with, especially in light of the recent Breveik shootings.  First a snide joke about Poland, okay, ha, ha, then the mocking of the dwarf is softened by his own witty retort, but the 'ironic' juxtaposition of a Sami making vilely racist remarks about another ethnic minority -the despised minority is shown to be just as prejudiced as the people making fun of his people, get it, ha ha?- pretty much killed it for me (the ultimate insult in this scene is that the point the Norwegian filmmaker actually makes is to cruelly ridicule the Sami who after all is arguing over Pickled Trout).

A bit too much for me, man, along with the sets whose intentionally dreary overtones are so overdone they actually are gaudy.

Irony is always done best when done subtly.  Most people fall into the trap of beating one over the head with supposed irony because they fear that otherwise it will be missed....but that's the point of irony, you see?  This director doesn't get it, much like Breveik doesn't get it; although, only one of them can claim insanity, I think.",1324771200,,2337,4.609638554216867
4435263,5,B004N1JGI4,"This excellent Norwegian film with English subtitles is touted to be ""one of the funniest movies,"" but it really isn't, in my view, a movie designed only to be funny. It has sad and sober parts, and properly so. Ulrik, an ex-convict, released from prison after a term of twelve years for murder, wants to be left alone. He seems a brooding man for virtually the entire film, seldom smiling. Numerous things go wrong for him during most of the film. He is released early and is not met by his buddies, fellow gang members who want him to kill the man who squealed on him. The gang head keeps telling him that Ulrik owes him; after all, he gave money to Ulrik's ex-wife and son during the twelve years that Ulrick was in prison. But did he? The gang leader takes Ulrick to a terrible place to live. He is introduced to an unattractive, overweight landlady, who will be making demands on Ulrick. He is taken to a shop to work as a mechanic where the owner warns him not to make out with the secretary.

This boss speaks with rapid speed, and delivers what he wants to say as if he were delivering a sermon, thereby adding to the humor of the story. Humor is also added by what happens to Ulrick and several women who offer him sex and how the sex act is done, and the reactions of both parties, and the jealousy that is created.

Viewers will find it interesting to see whether Ulrick decides to take revenge and how he reacts to the various pressures placed upon him.",1324512000,3,1465,4.343065693430657
4435264,4,B004N1JGI4,"Stellan Skarsgard delivers a masterful, understated performance as an ex-con desperately trying to stay an ex-con while attempting to connect with his son and his expecting daughter-in-law (who was told he had died, not that he was in prison). The supporting cast fills out the movie with grounded, believable, often off-kilter characters and much of the film has a wry sense of humor to it.",1323907200,2,391,5.030769230769231
4435265,5,B004N1JGI4,"My husband and I watched this last night, and thought it was great.  It's from Norway, and so is subtitled.  I think that Norway has one of highest standards of living in the world, but you wouldn't know it from the people and scenery in this movie.  There are some sporadic bursts of violence, but nothing extreme (except one part where I cringed), but it's pretty mild.  The humor is dry; we thought it was very funny, and didn't feel like it dragged at all.

 The sex was...I'm not sure what to say; it wasn't offensive, wasn't violent, was NOT for kids.  It's European which doesn't think sex and nudity is as big a deal as us Americans do.  Mostly, my mouth dropped a few times and then I laughed, but I wouldn't say that the sex scenes were meant to be arousing.

I'd rate this 5-stars for several reasons:  We really had no idea what was going to happen in the movie--a great story.  Funny, light-action,light-romance...  Plus, how often do you see movies from Norway?",1307836800,9,975,4.4772727272727275
8436382,3,B004N1JGI4,"A movie too full of improbabilities and absurdities to be really good, but when the father helps the daughter-in-law give birth in the back of his car, that is a touching and effective scene.",1500854400,,191,4.647058823529412
8436383,5,B004N1JGI4,Heart stoppinly funny. Think Ibsen mated with Edvard Grieg whose jazzed up Pyr Gent music runs terrifyingly lifting and lilting sound track beneath the play. Best damned soap opera ever!!,1474416000,,187,5.266666666666667
8436384,5,B004N1JGI4,"Stella Disregard is amazing as a man re-entering his life in the world. His plight is both funny, poignant, encouraging, and redemptive. It is a Scandinavian film, a bit dark, matter of fact about sex, but all well portrayed.",1473724800,,225,4.794871794871795
8436385,3,B004N1JGI4,"Coarse, but filled with restrained humor - probably better appreciated if you're familiar with Scandinavian humor.  Overall I found it well worth my time and would recommend it to others.",1414195200,,187,5.233333333333333
8436386,5,B004N1JGI4,I was never disappointed in the movie. From the beginning to the end I was excited to watch the movie.,1388707200,,102,4.15
8436387,5,B004N1JGI4,"Stellan Skarsgard never fails to give all to his characters.  Though Swedish is not my native tongue, the acting is so good that the humor as well as the humanity is clearly communicated.  This is one movie that I have watched over and over enjoying its quiet and gentle story.",1386720000,,277,4.52
8436388,4,B004N1JGI4,"I was browsing the foreign movie section at my local library and stumbled upon this. I took a quick look at the DVD jacket and decided to take a chance on this.

""A Somewhat Gentle Man"" (2010 release from Norway;  113 min.) brings the story of Ulrik, a middle-aged guy who just got released from a long stint in jail (for what we later learn is a murder of another man). Ulrik is picked up at his jail release by several shady-looking characters. Ulrik gets a place to stay at the sister of one of them, and then gets a job as a car mechanic upon the recommendation of one of them as well. But several questions pop up: there is a man out there with whom Ulrik's shady friends (or is it Ulrik himself) have an account to settle with. Why? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is billed as a comedy, and that it is, despite the shady business going on, but it is a very dry sense of humor that is being displayed. I didn't laugh out loud during the movie, but I did smile and chuckle quite a few times. Also, the picture of Norway that we see in this movie is not the postcard nice image of Norway that we would normally expect, it is grim, cold, and sometime outright depressing. Bottom line, this is a okay movie but one that I wouldn't rush out to see again.",1369785600,,1361,4.187022900763359
8436389,3,B004N1JGI4,"A story of a convinced murderer having his term served and his further betrayal of everyone kind to him.

Has one suggested this movie is a comedy, readiness of Norwegian females to please this Viking-in-his-late-fifties (looking much older but functioning at a first glance) is what to laugh at.

Not much logic in actions and no escape from a future term surely.",1364774400,,364,4.854838709677419
8436390,5,B004N1JGI4,"Stellan Skarsgard is the best!!!!! I'm going to make this movie part of my permanent collection. Great lighting, story line and cinematography as well. Reminds me of a Coen brothers film. 5 stars for this one.",1352332800,,209,4.833333333333333
8436391,5,B004N1JGI4,I am a fan of Stellan Skarsgard and that's the only reason that I decided to give this a shot. It was an enjoyable movie and I was pleasantly surprised as I didn't know what to expect. The humor in this is not over-the top but it is subtle and makes for an entertaining movie. Throw in a little drama and interesting tidbits and you have a great movie which is what this is. I definately recommend watching and or buying.,1332460800,2,421,4.209876543209877
