Since I already have it on my Kindle in both English (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-120-Days-of-Sodom/dp/B007733DXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 120 Days of Sodom</a>&nbsp;which cost $2.99) and in French (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/120-journes-de-Sodome-Les-French-Edition/dp/B005R8Y8PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">120 journes de Sodome, Les (French Edition)</a>&nbsp;which cost $0.00) I feel taken.

8342730,5,B001U3WP86,"This film is a superb tribute in memory of these children and youngsters who fell down in name of Van; this village who decided to send them to the front of War in 1915.

The clash of War, these unsaid details, the initiation of these creatures who were just living the spring of life, the sorrows and cries of mothers and the terrible climatic conditions that they had to bear, snow and cold winds are portrayed with magnificent realism without falling into that well knwon sentimentalism.

This director Ozhran Eren proves his talent with this singular and powerful account of this painful event that marked a brutal scare in the soul of many people by then.

Watch it. It will surprise your magnificent work of photography, edition,artistic direction, superb cast and formidable direction.

A must-see.",1302825600,,805,4.940740740740741
