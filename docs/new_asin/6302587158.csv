7827882,5,6302587158,"This video is a must have for any Toad the Wet Sprocket, Glen Phillips, or Lapdog fans.  Although the most easily recognisable song on this video is ""All I Want"", this video also contains earlier Toad videos such as ""Is it For Me?"" and ""Come Back Down"", and more.  Definately worth picking up.",971740800,5,293,4.509433962264151
7827883,5,6302587158,For all the Toad fans I strongly recommend this video. Like watching through a window and seeing the youthful early years of the band and their  progression and development. Plus it may not always be available.,949708800,5,210,4.833333333333333
