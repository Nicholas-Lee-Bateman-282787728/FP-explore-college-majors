8202616,3,B000RW3YUO,"I bought this collection because two of the movies were made in the Philippines.  I spent time in the P.I., during the 1950's, about the same time as the filming.  What can I say?  The movies are ""B"" grade and the acting not the best.  I enjoyed seeing scenes in the movies from the Philippines and that's about it.",1360713600,2,315,4.288135593220339
8202617,5,B000RW3YUO,"This is a George who is very comfortable with himself as an actor.  The Steel Claw was my favorite because
I see the playful side of him and his tremendous talent.  George, in my opinion, was one of a kind when it
came to developing his characters including changing his voice accordingly.  He was also, along with Tyrone
Power, the handsomest actor of his time. I read his book and his artistic talents and accomplishments were
far beyond anyone in his industry then and since.  The films in the George Montgomery Action Adventure
Collection were made under his own production company and one can see the relaxed easy going style when he
didn't have the usual studio constraints.",1316476800,4,680,4.737288135593221
