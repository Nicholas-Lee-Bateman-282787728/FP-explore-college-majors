To begin, we have two age 30-40 ""teenagers"" who just annoy me to begin with. Then there's a psycho caretaker and a pathetic father with separation anxiety. The psycho caretaker and pathetic father kill Buddy.

Then 20 years go by and what's-her-name is miserable. She's looking up magic mirrors in a book. Wow. Yeah, so intense. And of course, she's remembering their doomed love affair.

Then when the ""violent teenager"" (lol) get involved, they're also obviously in their 30s to 40s. It's a trainwreck.

The acting of every single ""actor"" in this is on par with the writing, therefore absolutely horrible.

Please avoid this if you value your time.",1500422400,,719,4.860655737704918
8110800,1,B000EL3US4,Don't do it to yourself this is self inflicted torture that no one deserves. Some of the characters are so plastic acting is atrocious. a lot of the dialog is like it was written by a sleep deprived 5 year old. The ending totally sucks and is stupid. I want but will never get back over an hour of my life wasted hoping this would get better,1487376000,,341,4.104477611940299

oh yeah right, like any school in Switzerland would accept someone like her.

8110804,2,B000EL3US4,"Really cheesey. Bad scripting, acting and story line. I didn't see the whole thing because it was that bad...",1483315200,,109,4.7894736842105265
8110805,1,B000EL3US4,"dark makeup under her eyes. Acting that is beyond human words. There's no word for how bad it is. A plot that needs a worse word beyond the word for the acting.

If two 16 year old kids produced and directed this, their drama teacher would tell them to study for Math and Physics classes VERY HARD.

The only redeeming quality was that it ended.

If you're the kind that Loves HORRIBLE movies that border on funny because they're so bad, this doesn't even really offer that. It's not campy, just HORRIFIC.

Amazon Prime comes up for renewal in a month. I have some thinking to do.",1481673600,5,580,4.392523364485982
8110806,4,B000EL3US4,"If your into z-grade schlock horror it doesn't get much better than DEADLY LOVE. This one beats any Troma horror farce by a long shot.
A mid-western supernatural thriller where a teen romance is silenced with a hillbilly's shot gun. A year after the poor guy has been left 6ft under, his ole' flame attempts to conjure his spirit via the art of black magic. Well, sure enough this dumb hick rises from his early grave complete with the same motorcycle outfit he got shot dead in. Now, they can finally get it on. But, wait the farm-boys are back.  But this time the walking-dead lover won't let them get in his way.
 This one deserves a remake. Well, perhaps a serious
attempt in the first place. In any case this rarely seen
flick is sheer 80's B-movie smut. Would be considered
for cult status if anybody had ever seen it.
More surprising then a dead man risen from the grave is that someone actually dug this up for home video release!
Thanks to COMPLETE entertainment inc. you can
now own this in your personal collection.

8110807,5,B000EL3US4,"This is a wonderful horror movie. It was on Zone Horror recently and I found it very good indeed. It is very atmospheric and different to most other movies. The music in the film is a joy. It's great we can buy it on video but it is rather expensive. What we need now is a DVD release with special features. If you love horror movies from the 1980's, this movie is for you. I recommend you buy it.",1223769600,,397,4.037974683544304
