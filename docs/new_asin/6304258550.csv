824225,1,6304258550,"Well, I must say that this is a terrible film. I only saw it because a friend of mine gave it to me (along with Kids which is actually quite good) as a gag gift for Christmas. He told me that the acting was horrible (and  it is), that in a pointless stripping scene the girl couldn't dance (and  she can't), but there's a lot of pointless nudity and the bad acting is  funny (which is also true). Me and my friend are movie addicts and we don't  plan on ever sobering up. I find that this movie is just sorta fun to watch  in-between serious movies. And I found something intriguing about an  overweight girl in a nude scene...you don't really get to see that much. A  cheap rip-off of the Craft and an insult to viewers....but it could be fun  to make fun of with some friends in a Mystery Science Theatre vein...this  would be MST3K after dark though.",948844800,,853,4.248447204968944

The couple of lead actresses are actually quite good, there is some blood and gore, but nothing too much, a little bit of prankish nudity and a lot of actually quite funny moments and interactions. I can actually say that I would recommend this as a light-hearted and easy on the eyes and head movie that takes you away from day to day stuff and lets you just relax for a little bit of time!

Having been a kid during the 1980's ""Satanic Panic"" scare of those times, I think I am primed to enjoy stuff like this. Watching this film is a bit like watching a really bad made for TV movie on the life time channel. You can't help but watch, wonder why you are still watching but can't quite turn it off. Now it has become a guilty pleasure. You feel guilty for still watching and then it is out right laughter. For how bad the script is, some of the acting was surprisingly well done.  I had a few laugh out loud moments during the 3rd act. You either enjoy the cheese-wiz or not.. I do not recommend paying for this movie. If you have Prime you may want to  check it out for free.

This was her first movie so I wanted to check it out.  It came out around the same time as The Craft, but in this movie the girls actually take their clothes off.  According to the information I was looking at about the movie it sounded like it was going to be longer.  The description said one thing ""and then all hell breaks loose"" but after that part the movie basically ended, it wasn't as scary as I was thought it was going to be but I still thought it was good.  Clea Duvall is a few month's younger than I am.  The first time I watched it I didn't recall any foul language, which I found refreshing, but I'm watching it again just to make sure.",1399075200,3,799,4.057324840764331
825046,4,6304258550,"So I was listening to the awesome hip-hop song ""Villuminati by J. Cole for like the 10th time, and when the above lyric played, memories of this movie suddenly came flooding back and I wanted to see if I could find it!

My first introduction to this film came when I found a used VHS copy of it at a video rental store's liquidation sale.  At the time I had just bought one of those new-fangled DVD player devices, but I still had my VCR, so I enjoyed finding tapes for free or practically free.  The cover and back summary of the tape sleeve dealt with witches, one of my favorite supernatural movie subjects, and in particular it looked like a lower budget version of ""The Craft"" (complete with a picture of star Sheeri Rapapport looking exactly like Fairuza Bulk!).  So I thought, hey, for a dollar, it's worth checking out!  I really liked this one, so much so that I was sad when my VCR finally went and I had to get rid of it!

""Little Witches"" opens with an interesting scene of nude and semi-nude female witches conducting a ritual using mirrors, knives, grotesque animal masks and strategically-placed foliage.  They are interrupted by mysterious, black-robed figures.  The scene shifts, and we soon learn that what we have seen was a failed attempt by the fabled and infamous Illuminati, an 1890s witch coven that, while students at an all-girls California Catholic boarding school, had tried to raise a bloodthirsty demon.

A century later, at the same Catholic school, a group of six fun-loving girls are left by their parents for various reasons to spend Easter break at the school.  Within the group are two very different girls, the studious, shy and innocent Faith, and the rebellious, smart-aleck bad girl Jamie, who quickly becomes the group's leader. Assigned to teen-sitting duties is the young, beautiful and kind nun Sister Sherilyn, and she has her hands full with these girls. Left largely to their own devices, the girls spend their days flirting with and fantasizing about the onsite construction crew, goofing off and scheming various hijinks like stealing and drinking the chapel wine.  After the construction crew discovers the Illuminati's ritual cave- complete with corpses - beneath the chapel itself, the girls' curiosity is piqued and they become light-heartedly fixated on the 19th-century witch coven.  When the black magic they cast begins to work and things get all dark and creepy, Faith wants out, but Jamie's hunger for power gets stronger, and she pushes the other girls into forming a new coven and raising that previously forgotten demon.

As previously stated, I am a big fan of witches in popular fiction.  Though I love and respect Wiccans and Pagans, and know that true magical practice is a peaceful and beautiful religion, popular culture depictions of witches are just plain fun!  I've seen so many: ""The Craft,"" ""Hocus Pocus,"" ""Black Candles,"" ""The Lords of Salem,"" ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch,"" ""Bell, Book and Candle,"" you name it, I've seen it, and probably own it!  That being said, this one is not half bad.  It's definitely a B movie, with the requisite B-grade acting (with the exception of Sheeri Rappaport), effects, writing and plot development.  However, it's done well and though not perfect, is very entertaining. It utilizes shadows and slanted camera angles a lot, and I actually liked the effect.

It does contain some random nudity (though no actual sex), especially by Sheeri Rappaport, who is the film's most frequently disrobed (literally like 5 times), but also the film's best actor.  How rare is that? :-) I mean, she's a delight to watch, a talented and funny actress with a very natural delivery.  There are no 4-letter words in this movie, though there is a little tiny bit of sexually suggestive dialogue.

As far as special effects go, yeah, as stated, they're not the best.  We get a very puppet-looking demon, a zombie, black blood that oozes out of walls and statues, some objects that fly through the air by themselves, and yeah that's about it.

Of note: We have the appearance of Zelda Rubinstein, most famously of ""Poltergeist,"" as the mysterious and feared Mother Clodah.  Also, we get the gorgeous Jennifer Rubin as Sister Sherilyn.  If you love horror movies like I do, you will recognize her as Taryn in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3:  The Dream Warriors"" (""In my dreams, I'm beautiful...and BAD!"":-) It's so funny that one of Sister Sherilyn's pep-talk lines to the girls is ""I know what you're going through.  It was not so long ago that I was in your shoes!"", when not even 10 years prior she played a troubled, rebellious teenager herself...though she was up against Freddy Krueger, who's a heck of a lot scarier than the animatronic demon in this movie! :-)

So, if you like diabolical, heretical witches running amok of the establishment, and especially if you're an Amazon Prime member and can see this for free, check it out!  I find it highly entertaining, and I'm glad I've been reunited with it after many years.  :-)",1396569600,,5017,4.832748538011696

825051,3,6304258550,"This is not a good movie, not in the way that makes a film like 'Poltergeist' good. The acting is terrible, the special effects are laughable & the plot is wafer thin. However it IS good in a ""so bad it's good"" schlocky horror film way. If you are looking for something that's actually good, then skip this film. If you want something to laugh at & enjoy for it's badness, get this film.

The plot line of the film shows that either this film was written immediately after the release of 'The Craft' or that it was in development & pushed out quickly in order to capitalize on the 'Craft' hype. The plot follows a group of teen girls (mostly played by women in their 20s) who attend a Catholic school where a satanic temple has been discovered. The girls find a magical text that outlines several spells & before they know it, they've been looped together by the school bad girl in an attempt to summon up an otherworldly being.

Really, I did enjoy this film. It's one of the first schlocky horror films I watched & it introduced me to a lot of the classic schlocky horror from the 80s, so I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for it. The fact that it had Zelda ""This house is now clean"" Rubenstein from the 'Poltergeist' movies only made it more awesome, although she was woefully underused.

For what was obviously a film slapped together in record time, it's really not that bad. It doesn't deserve any more than 3 stars (where I'd give a film like Night of the Demons 5 stars), though. If you want to see this, I recommend tracking down a really cheap VHS or DVD copy or a rental first.

The highlight in the cast was Sheeri Rappaport, though, clearly the best actor in the film, and not just because of her nudity in the film  She came across as very realistic.  For many of the other actors, I saw them reciting lines, which was disappointing. Some of the plot was a little questionable, like why they had to take so many precautions on their first visit to the crypt, but then went at their leisure, and yes, the effects could have gone a LOT further......but, all in all something grabbed me about the film and I really sat waiting to see what was going to happen next.

825053,1,6304258550,"Based on the scant extra features shown above I would have to guess the answer is ""nothing"". I would say freeze frame but that comes with your DVD player already so it doesn't count.
""Little Witches"" is little more than a two hour stream of unimaginative fluff, bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, gratuitous nudity, and even more bad acting. This movie is so bad that one so inclined would find it hard to last long enough to see any of the aforementioned nudity, which I assure you is no reason to buy this movie.
I find it hard to find any redeeming factors in ""Little Witches"". I can't even bring myself to make any up. There are some performances by noteworthy B-list actors such as Jack Nance, Zelda Rubinstein, and Jennifer Rubin in roles they'd probably rather forget about. Unfortunately this movie held the distincion of being the late Jack Nance's last performance.  On a more amusing note, indie actress Clea DuVall (of Girl,Interrupted fame) has a few memorable scenes which she'll have a hard time justifying now.

I bought it because I like the movie ""The Craft"" (the one with Neve Campbell) and was hoping to find another movie like it since I find that subject interesting. I was so disappointed in Little Witches. It is TERRIBLE. There's hardly any magic spells (beyond cheesey ritual and bringing about one sad looking demon) and it has the worst ending. It answers NO questions. One minute it's at its ""climax"" (if you can call it that) and then suddenly, without transition, it's done. Some scenes are semi-pornographic and it all is just incredibly stupid. It's a horrible waste of money.

Me and my buddies checked the movie out because we saw the box and thought it was going to be a cool cheesy  horror movie... but it wasn't cool at all. The ""good"" lead  character was whiney, the ""bad"" lead character was lame-acting  and dances so badly in her nude Striptease scene that she's an affront to  all white people. The best-looking and interesting girls hardly talked or  didn't speak at all. I'm talking about the hot black girl who hardly had  any lines and was obviously given all the bad joke lines and the sexy  blonde who didn't get to say a thing. Oye,they were the only reason me and  my friends sat through the movie and we felt cheated. The plot made no  sense and the editing was horrific... but I guess that's why you don't see  Jane Simpson's name on any other movies.",962150400,3,902,4.379518072289157

The only person you might recognize in the  movie is Clea Duvall, who was in THE FACULTY and GIRL, INTERRUPTED.  But  other than that, not one single person in the movie is worth metioning.

Well, their crap can be your gold because the movie isn't horrible but rather decent. The effects and staging are cheesy but the story and characters keep things interesting.

Being that this is a 1990's nostalgic movie, I find it rather upsetting, because the acting is good, the plot is soundly structured and moves along at a good pace; and the characters are written very well.

""Little Witches"" completes the trifecta of ""witchy"" classics from the late 1980s and early to the mid 1990s.

Overall, I'm giving this one three stars as the dialogue is vague and nuanced at times; the death scenes are clearly fake and the ending is lukewarm and anti-climactic. Otherwise, not completely a bad movie. It's a decent one time watch. Sadly, Mimi Reichmeister's (Mimi Rose) career never really took off.

If you are up for a decent ""witchy"" movie, then you'll like this one, for a one time watch, as mentioned.",1474416000,,925,4.621951219512195
