6808458,5,B00PHSDS0E,"I saw this movie in the theaters in two formats...and it is stunning. The other reviews will cover that...indeed the best anime art work that has ever been done...and that is worth the price of admission easily.  It is also a very interesting folk story of ancient Japan.

But  the point I want to make is...please hope that this disk includes the subtitled version.  I saw the film in both versions and there is no comparison.  I can explain it this way.  Once I was in a stopover in Vienna and turned on the television and there was dubbed version of
an American Western spoken in German.  To me the whole experience was ludicrous.  Now in this tale there are moments when the
main character Princess Kaguya sings Japanese folk songs.  In Japanese it works so effectively.  But in English?  Not really.

My parents had me watch subtitled movies when I was two years old...Enjoy  the film as it was meant to be presented.",1417046400,41,922,4.548780487804878
6808459,5,B00PHSDS0E,"The video release of this movie couldn't come soon enough!  I NEED to add this to my anime collection.  The movie was just that good, simply put.",1416268800,14,145,4.333333333333333
6808460,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Not many animated films can yield so many ideas so effortlessly: independence, melancholy, happiness, simplicity, dissatisfaction, and love. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is hand-drawn in the finest sense; you can pretty much make an exquisite painting out of any frame in the film! Everything feels as delicate and precious as the title character herself. It sounds silly to suggest for a film so simplistically drawn, but its really worth getting on Blu-Ray. Its the type of film that deserves the best output as possible. As of this writing, it remains to be seen whats included as extras, but getting the movie itself is rewarding enough.

None of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya really pampers you on any level, and it certainly requires your sense of wonder to match its very own. Film enthusiasts will adore The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, while regular moviegoers may initially struggle with both the animation and pace of the plot. Like the recent The Wind Rises, this movie isn't concerned with needing to explain everything to you. Right from the unique visual style, it seems to already know it's different to begin with. Nonetheless, this is an excellent film for older children and beyond.

This movie is adapted from an old Japanese folktale, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. Those familiar with the original story won't find any huge deviations from the film, and probably the most notable difference is the smaller role that the Emperor plays (there are others that can't be written without spoiling a key plot element). Here's the general premise: A bamboo cutter and his wife stumble upon a girl the size of their palms. As she grows quickly to normal size within the village and the couple takes on the role of parents, they all eventually move to a mansion in the capital when the bamboo cutter finds heaps of gold, a sign he interprets that the girl is of royalty and must be raised as such.

Hence, she becomes Princess Kaguya, and is taught to adapt to her new lifestyle, which she struggles with throughout the movie. It eventually turns into a trigger for her sadness that the film wonderfully captures without resorting to cliches or cluttered dialogue. This is a big reason why the film feels like such a classic even before the closing credits roll, as it has the smart storytelling frankness to match its one-of-a-kind animation. There are plenty of adorable and funny moments to complement its more serious ones. It also has all the subtleties characteristic of a Studio Ghibli film, whether it is the growing sound of a little baby as Kaguya twirls under a cherry blossom tree in one moment, or the very meaningful tears in her eyes in another moment.

If theres one minor complaint, the twist towards the last act is rather abrupt and requires the audience to shift their attention to some extent. Bear in mind that this crucial moment is also part of the original folktale, so this is not to fault the source material but its placement in the movie. The main problem is how awkward it feels for a change in the story that the film only gave very minor hints to build up. Then again, that's why it's a twist, and like those from many past film classics, you'll either love it or hate it. Moreover, this does nothing to ruin the overall experience. In fact, it only gives way for even more beautiful animation!

For all its hand-drawn artwork and narrative that feels out of place in the 21st century, it strips away all of those contemporary tropes seen in todays films, and whats left is something unexpectedly organic and accessible to the audience. Teenagers will relate to Kaguyas complex emotions, while parents will sympathize with the bamboo cutters actions, understanding that he has only the best intentions for the princess. All of the emotions that The Tale of the Princess Kaguya perfects are actually unsurprising given the resume of its director, Isao Takahata. His work in anime spans across six different decades, and includes directing Grave of the Fireflies and the underrated Only Yesterday. Takahatas focus on fragile expressions gives his works lasting impact, and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, definitely a film that history will place as a classic in due time, is no exception.",1416182400,252,4237,4.822558459422283

6808473,5,B00PHSDS0E,"An adaptation of ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"" from the director of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and ""Only Yesterday"" this is one of Ghibli's best. The art-style as best as I can describe it is a modern take on classical Japanese masterpieces using watercolor and color pencil. This film is beautiful. There is a powerful scene, a part of which you can see in the trailer, where our princess runs away and the style becomes abstract and messy to reflect her emotion and it is goosebumpsingly gorgeous.

A part of me wants the pacing to be faster, the scenes to be shorter, the plot to be tighter; but another part of me wants to see this art and animation for as long as possible. Oftentimes Ghibli is called the ""Disney of Japan"" undeservingly so but apt for this film. I imagine that future generations will look at this movie like we in the west look back on ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Little Mermaid"", or ""Mulan"" as adaptations of fairy and folktales that are cultural touchstones.",1520208000,,980,4.6

Great film for both adults and family, beautiful music, my little one has been trying to sing the Japanese songs from the film. This is a slow movie, but one that we appreciate.

6808482,1,B00PHSDS0E,"This has nothing to do with the movie and everything to do with the fact that when we opened it, there was no Blu-ray, and the only DVD was a bonus disc. Sadly, the return window was closed and we just barely got around to opening the movie. I've never had any problems with movies not containing what they say, especially when they're brand new, so it didn't even occur to me to open it. I will now open every movie as soon as I buy it.

You can feel Kaguya's sorrow, happiness, frustration and compassion throughout the movie.
The animation is amazing and so realistic, facial expressions, little movements and gestures, you can tell the director worked hard, trying to make this a movie that honors the tale and the world it takes place in, while also honoring today's society.

6808485,5,B00PHSDS0E,"This is a unique film. It is unique among the Studio Ghibli productions, in not using any of their cell animation strengths and rich detailed backgrounds. It is unique among all full length animations in its uncompromised pursuit of quick, unrepeatable aquarel strokes. It is probably crazy to animate that, but that is what the Ghibly animators accepted to do for Isao Takahata's final work. (He was 80 when they released this.) It is unique among all films and stories, in that it goes into as much detail into the realities of Japan as any Kurosawa's film, but gradually takes off into visions as surreal as the craziest anime, e.g. Paprika. An amazing amazing experience.
The second disc contains the documentary about the production process. The story is Japanese folklore, familiar to every child, and the actors spent more than a year recording the sound before a single drawing was made. The English overdubbing is OK, but probably sounds like a crime to the native speakers. It is therefore particularly absurd that Amazon markets it as a ""Chloe Grace Moretz"" movie. She probably did a wonderful work of overdubbing. But this might be a film that people will watch in awe long after Toy Story and maybe even Princes Mononoke start looking like Mickey Mouse.",1501113600,,1266,4.8930232558139535

6808487,5,B00PHSDS0E,"I'm writing this review to give thanks to Isao Takahata. This is the kind of movie that you can't make sense out of with your mind. It speaks the language of the heart and soul. The story is simple and so are the visuals. But it's just the movie that will stay with you forever. And why? how? You can't pin it down with words. The star-seed/wanderer phenomenon in the last century comes to mind. Higher-density beings coming down to Earth to know what it's like, to expand in love, to learn, to grow. Orphaned from their past by the veil of forgetfulness that comes with every Earth-human incarnation. Experiencing great joy, bliss, and heart-break. Suffering and calling out to their original home. A sense of losing who their sense of self and sense of why they're here--their mission. Wanting to end it all. Wanting to go home wherever that is. Feeling incredibly lost. Then remembering. Slowly. Slowly. Finding themselves again. Archangel Metatron said, if you go with unfinished business, you will just come back. And I believe Kaguya will still come back and do it again, and do it better by asserting herself, speaking up, choosing her greatest happiness, choosing that life with Sutemaru..in another lifetime.",1499040000,7,1217,4.884057971014493

6808496,3,B00PHSDS0E,"By Studio Ghibli standards, Kaguya is a competent re-imagining of the underlying folk lore, which was ironically about how inhuman or superior Princess Kaguya was to regular humans. The retelling of the tale paints Princess Kaguya in a manner that is undeniably human and at times very touching.

While the film plays on powerful themes of austerity, identity and longing, it does so in a disappointingly narratively incoherent way; while the story is about Kaguya's life, it does not follow a traditional western climax-denoument structure, which can be frustrating to some viewers. Thematic elements of the narrative are sometimes dropped without warning or sprung on the viewer without foreshadowing or sufficient introduction. Characters that one would expect to have a greater impact on Kaguya's life are given very little narrative utility.

The animation style is unique, but I do not accept it as an ""artistic"" alternative to the stunning visuals we've come to expect from the studio. The soft palette and the loose line art evoke traditional Japanese watercolors, while the choppy animation is meant to capture energy and movement rather than detail. That being said, it's glaringly obvious that the animation quality is not there throughout most of Kaguya with some awkward close-ups looking like single-frame draft storyboards, failing to capture the emotions in the eyes or, for example, the signature ""hair raise"" of Ghibli characters in anger or distress. This is lampshaded as interpretive of Kaguya's development and emotional state, but I don't believe it acts as a viable substitute to the consistent visual splendor of Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke.

Definitely worth a watch for Ghibli enthusiasts, but I would not rank this among my favorites of the collection.",1491955200,2,1787,5.329787234042553

6808521,5,B00PHSDS0E,"The story is a thousand years old, and the anime pays it a tribute in the form of a beautiful, hand-drawn palette, characters in period style and costume, and socially conscious dialogue that gently parodies the attitudes of the time.  The tale is magical, moving, and has one of the best bittersweet endings I have ever seen.  It is a long time since I wept at the end of a movie, but I did so last night.

The story is about a magical baby who grows into a princess, barely understood by her bamboo cutter father, and indeed scarcely more understood by herself.  The movie is then a journey of self discovery, and a tale of love and loss. The ending has a simple inevitability that is no less wrenching for being played with realism rather than melodrama.

Voice acting is hard.  One has no facial expressios, no gestures, no helpful scenery or props, and must create the chracter by voice alone.  For that reason, I always watch anime in the original language, where accomplished voice actors such as Horie Yui carry the dialogue. Western dubs tend to use voice actors who range from mediocre to terrible.  But not here.  The producers made the stellar decision to cast Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya, and she is brilliant.  Of course, she is not only a great live actor, but has been a voice actor since she was nine.  Over the movie, she moves slowly from uncertain narration, to sly comedy, to deep emotion.  In a dream sequence near the end, when Kaguya is flying, Chloe's voice soars as does her character.  Clearly, she put her heart into it.

Highly, highly recommended.",1476662400,,1578,4.589285714285714

6808532,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Isao Takahata has made his masterpiece with this film. He hasn't officially announced his retirement yet, but at 79 years old and considering his notoriously glacial filmmaking pace, I wouldn't hold my breath for another film from him. If that does turn out to be the case here, this is the perfect film to go out on. Very rarely has any movie made me visibly emotional, but Kaguya succeeded in doing exactly that. At moments I was laughing, and then one scene later I was immediately reduced to a sobbing mess. Movies have made me tear up before, but never to such an extent. Except, of course, for Grave of the Fireflies (another film oh-so conveniently directed by Takahata, someone give this guy a hug). Takahata has a great understanding of human emotions not often seen by other directors. Emotions almost literally spill off the screen in his films, and Princess Kaguya is no exception, with its painterly like animation style morphing to fit every different mood displayed. The film itself is a lovely metaphor for life itself, in that it makes you feel every emotion in the book. So let's break down some of the main factors of the film here.

Art/Animation:
First and foremost that many will take notice of is the unique animation style, which looks like the ultimate realization and of the art Takahata had been flirting with 14 years prior in his previous film, My Neighbors the Yamadas. The artwork is of course a very high selling point for the film, and one of its greatest strengths. Inspired by traditional watercolor paintings and charcoal sketches from ancient Japanese scrolls, the film's emotions at many times come through in the art itself. The detail, fluidity and form of the art itself constantly changes along with the current tone of particular scenes. During one particularly notable scene in the film when Kaguya escapes from the castle in an enraged fury, the animation follows suit by evolving into an erratic and wild explosion of rough charcoal lines and tones of black and grey, with a striking and ominous moon looming in the background (a symbol that is foreshadowed many times throughout the film). Another sequence involving a nobleman hunting down a dragon of legends is so fluidly drawn yet rough at the same time. It was absolutely entrancing. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is probably the only animated film that truly takes advantage of the visual capabilities of the animated medium. It employs its unique visual style to actually enhance the mood the film is attempting to get across, making it all the more powerful.

Sound:
The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is possibly equally as wonderful. It only enhances the film's impact, with beautiful tracks that have stayed imprinted in my head ever since. It just feels so right. The main theme that repeats throughout the film represents the beauty of life, perfectly accommodating the film's own themes. And it doesn't hurt that it's also extremely catchy, as well as the upbeat Celestial Being music that plays during a not-so-upbeat moment during the climax of the film. There's also one more recurring track initially played at the beginning of the film that is a very simple but haunting melody that stuck with me until the end. Hearing it now having seen the film tends to bring a tear to my eye. I do believe it is some of Hisaishi's best work. We were spoiled this year with two of his soundtracks, the other for The Wind Rises. And while that film's soundtrack was great as well, I feel as though this one edges it out dimply by being so perfect for the film it's playing in. Everything is just so wonderfully timed. Some lovely Japanese tracks are played on the koto as well, so while Ghibli's English dub (which is included in the Japanese release) is just as high quality as we've come to expect (It has James Caan!), I'd personally recommend that you watch it in its original Japanese first so you can experience the lovely singing. It's always difficult to re-dub those scenes in foreign films anyway, but Ghibli did a good job with it nonetheless.

Final Thoughts:
This film will stick with me long after I've seen it, just like all great films do. And hopefully it will stick with you as well. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will make you feel human. And I respect any work of art that can elicit that feeling. This is indeed Isao Takahata's magnum opus, and Ghibli's penultimate achievement. As perfect as a film can get. Definitely check it out. Just make sure you have a box of tissues handy. Or two.

6808533,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Out of the Ghibli films this is easily one of my favorites. It is also a stand out as a result of the water color animation style, which in many ways is a homage to the classic Japanese animation masterpiece of Belladonna of Sadness. The film itself strikes a melancholy note, both revealing the beauty of life, as well of it's downsides.
The story of course is a Japanese fairy tale, and it does play out like one. But the pathos is in the characters in the film, especially Princess Kaguya. The pacing may be a little slow for American audiences, and traditional anime fans may not like it very much either. But as a piece of cinematic art, the film is indeed excellent. One of Studio Ghibli's best films.",1468454400,,707,4.446153846153846

The princess then transforms into a child and it is up to the couple to raise her as their own. The bamboo cutter is adamant about providing the best life for his adopted daughter and it appears that forces beyond him want this as well.

The animation style Ghibli opted to utilize for this film is rather unique and it looks absolutely amazing. The backgrounds are mostly made to look like watercolor paintings while the characters retain a more rough-sketch look instead of the finely polished look common in other Ghibli films. This gives the movie a look that is breathtaking to watch.

This was directed by Takahata and while the difference in sensibility from Miyazaki is clear, this is a Studio Ghibli movie thru and thru. The movie is composed of beautiful watercolor-like computer rendered images (Yamadas) and amazing sketchy animation sequences.

The movie is rated PG for nudity, but there is no salacious content: breastfeeding, and historically accurate nudity for babies and small children. It's difficult to see who might be offended by any of it, but there is always someone out there.

I am unsure bout the original tale, having never read it, but the movie feels like those European live action versions of fairy tales where they decided a single tale will not provide enough entertainment for feature length and thus the blend two traditional tales into a single movie.
Kaguya could easily be two tales, that of Kaguya's development and eventual fate, in addition to the tale of the princes who seek her hand in marriage and what fate befalls them (which fits very organically into the whole, but also feels too Eroupean - or is it just me?) Two and a half hours may have been too much for the story.

Also, the contemporary feminist attitudes could very well be a part of the original, traditional tale, but the way they were treated feels quite modern. It's not that they do not work, but they are maybe too obvious. As it is the tale contains lessons for both parents and children and is recommended for both.",1446681600,2,1475,4.818181818181818

Watch it subtitled with both the original Japanese voices and, just as important, choose to have the subtitles be of the original Japanese script, _not_ the English translated screenplay dialogue.  The film itself is sobering and elegaic, but artistically it is a pinnacle of hand-drawn animation mimicking hand-drawn art, augmented here and there with quasi-3D.  Disney's Meander, first seen in the short Paperman, already eclipses it in terms of artistic technique from a purely technical perspective, but the preternatural, meditative elegance and economy of motion emblematic of Studio Ghibli transcends even so exquisite a refinement of technique.  The world has Yoshiaki Nishimura to thank for spending literally years beseeching Isao Takahata daily to make one last film before retiring, then bending over backwards to grant him the opportunity to do so his own way.  The distinctive style which resulted speaks for itself.  The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is haunting, empathetic, evocative, with his trademark gentle touch, but where drama is warranted, as the riveting sequence of Kaguya fleeing her meat-market coming-of-age ceremony, he delivers in spades, and with a beautiful touch of a stark ending into silence punctuated only by her furtive expulsions involuntarily as she sprints desperately through the countryside back to the only home she's ever truly known.

6808596,3,B00PHSDS0E,"Not ""beware of"" as in don't do it but rather ""be wary in"" as in be careful doing it.  Folktales and fairytales tend to come with morals and meanings as old as they are, tightly interwoven into the plot.  Change them or remove them as you wish; just make sure you are aware of every thread because if you leave too many contradictory ones behind you can turn your story into a muddle.  IMHO that is exactly what happened here.

""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter"" arguably has two meanings and two morals, one religious and one secular.  The trouble is that the religious meaning and moral is only going to appeal to adherents of that one religion, while being off putting to everyone else, and the secular meaning and moral is obsolete.

The religious meaning and moral is in keeping with the teachings of Buddhism, where the goal is to achieve Nirvana: emptiness, detachment from everyone and everything.  Thus, to a Buddhist, this story has a happy ending: Princess Kaguya is dragged kicking and screaming back to heaven where she is made to forget her entire life and everyone she loved, right in front of her grieving parents.

whoopee....

In contrast the secular meaning and moral is that it is wrong to love and marry outside of your station in life, whether above or below, and I shouldn't have to point out how offensive that is in our much more egalitarian world.  The problem here is that Isao Takahata tries to justify this by switching blame and making a romance based argument.  Unlike in the original where the high ranking ministers and the emperor himself are condemned for their own folly, in this version the bamboo cutter father is condemned for trying to make his adopted daughter into a court lady worthy of a high marriage, by using the gifts of gold and beautiful cloths he is apparently receiving from the very same gods who sent him Kaguya in the first place.  Undermining this is the lack of any alternative offered for what he should have done with the gifts of gold and silk from the gods instead.  Besides, the only alternative suitor presented, a neighbor boy she grew up with, hasn't let his remembered childhood feelings for her keep him from marrying and fathering a son.

Thus, by the time this movie reaches its climax with Kaguya fleeing ""rescue"" by the Moon People, it has become clear that no happy ending is possible...

or ever was possible, no matter what different choices she or her parents or her childhood friend had made.  She was doomed from the start, which makes the Buddhist meaning, that her whole life was a punishment she was saved from in the end, the closest to the truth.  Unfortunately, while Kaguya received the gift of forgetfulness, viewers will not and are thus stuck remembering this beautifully animated, hopelessly sad tale of a likable heroine who never had a chance at happiness.

In contrast I would suggest watching Takahata's first great directorial effort, recently made available again after a very long time, and arguably the most influential anime film of all time&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>.",1443312000,17,3246,5.013035381750465

6808629,4,B00PHSDS0E,"The Tale of Princess Kaguya tells a joyful, unfortunate story about a strange girls delights and miseries in this world. All of Kaguyas emotions and reactions to the things that go on around her are completely believable and it is very easy to relate to her as her encounters with pretention and greed change her from a carefree child into a somber adult.

The pacing is slow and slice-of-life in style. Everyday happenings are shown in detail.

The movie tackles a lot of issues about life in general, using natures cycle as an example of trials coming and going, and seeming to focus most of all on human nature, on our unending dissatisfaction with what we have, and on the way our best intentions can bring about ruin. However, despite all of Kaguyas hardships, she still desires never to leave this world.

The artwork is made up of charcoal lines and gorgeous watercolor, like exquisite echoes of some of the more full drawings in My Neighbors the Yamadas.

The music is my favorite part of the movie; Joe Hisaishi doesnt disappoint. The score is most comparable to that of Princess Mononoke in style, and I loved the use of the traditional Japanese instrument called the koto.

The ending did leave something to be desired for me. But this film is from the director of Grave of the Fireflies, and it should be kept in mind that while Hayao Miyazaki tends to present more happy, if at times realistically bittersweet, endings to his films, Isao Takahata does not always shy away from tragic ones. I do not enjoy tragic endings myself, but I cannot say that there is nothing to be learned from this one.

All in all, this is perhaps the most unique film Studio Ghibli ever made. (And knowing the studio, thats saying something.) It isn't for everyone, and in my opinion it is meant to be experienced rather than analyzed.",1436832000,,1826,4.65527950310559

Kaguya avoids this by being simply fantastic. The houses, landscapes, voice acting, and character animations all drew me in. Storywise it's predictable, but the beauty of the world and how it's fleshed out is a banquet for the eyes. Takahata took longer than Miyazaki to make his last movie, but it was worth waiting for.

It is movie that satisfies on so many levels: artistic, intellectually provoking, beautiful musical compositions and a beautiful retelling of an ancient Japanese tale.  I found myself drawn into observing the ways the different classes of society was depicted back in the 10th century.  Eleven centuries later and not much has changed.  To those who expect explosions, fast cars, loose morals and superhuman feats, ummmm.....this movie has none of those.  It does have a story that will touch your heart, if you let it, and will leave you wondering what your life is about and how to live it to the fullest.  You might examine what your life might have been had certain forces not tugged you in certain directions.  It might transport you back to your childhood or to your saddest periods of your life.  What it will not do is erode your brain cells, which many Hollywood movies are capable of doing.

I do not try to retell the plot or analyze characters because there are plenty of reviewers that have already performed this task.

6808640,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Heralded as Isao Takahata's ""masterpiece"", this film lives up to its title. I've read quite a few reviews stating that the art is quote ""horrible"", ""ugly"", and ""disappointing"". What those people don't realize is that Takahata's goal was to make this movie look and feel different, and he was able to achieve something in the animation field that had never been done before. He wanted the art to look like a sketch that had come to life, and thus there was no ""clean up"" phase during the animation process which most of us are used to seeing. Also keep in mind that this movie was not created using cel animation, something that Studio Ghibli is know for, so if you're looking for another Kiki's Delivery Service, or Howl's Moving Castle, look elsewhere. This is not the same.
Another thing that bothered me was reviews stating that the story was ""boring"" and the characters were ""obnoxious"". As many other people have stated, this movie is based on a Japanese Folktale. The thing you have to keep in mind about old Japanese stories: many do not end happily; many do not have complex characters; many do not try to make you feel good. This story is ultimately about regret, and about not living life to the fullest. It's trying to teach you something and impart a feeling of joy through living.
All I can say is to just give it a try. Some people are going to love it, like I did, and some people are going to hate it. If you can appreciate the unusual artistry, sweeping visuals, and storytelling then this might just be one for you Ghibli collection.",1435881600,,1551,4.562724014336918

6808654,5,B00PHSDS0E,"""The Tale of the Princess Kaguya""
(Studio Ghibli)
Directed and Co-written by Isao Takahata
. . . . .

This is another odd, enchanting gem from Studio Ghibli, a retelling of an old Japanese folk tale, ""The Bamboo Cutter's Daughter,"" about a magical girl who rises from peasant to princess, but spends her entire life fending off unworthy suitors. The script is slow-moving, though not as outright weird or baffling as the better known Ghibli films by Hayao Miyazaki.  The visual style is different as well, not as colorful or lush as Miyazaki's films, though perhaps most striking for its stylistic homage to traditional Japanese tapestries and panel paintings. There are some beautiful images and a more subtle palette -- the magical ending sequence, though sparsely illustrated, is quite evocative and beautiful. The film might not be for everyone, but if you're already on the Studio Ghibli wavelength, you'll definitely want to check it out.

They why would she cry on the way to the Moon? Grave of the Fireflies was a horrible movie - just showing us all the misery but no story.

If you watch ""North by Northwest"" you get the essence of Hitchcock. If you are interested in the works by Studio Ghibli and Mr. Hayao, just give a shot to ""Laputa, the castle in the sky"".

Along the way it tackles how humans use artifice not only to express and sometimes understand aspects of themselves, but also to separate themselves from chaos. Yet in doing so the structures and dictates they create:  status, symbols of status, power, wealth, belief,
ways of appearing and acting -- even looking for the perfection in things and people rather than looking at those people and things as THEMSELVES -- wind up separating us far too much from the world, from others, and from ourselves.

The Princess is far too often prized for what others project upon her, and far too rarely as herself, and yet that is true for most of the characters in the film.

The movie will leave you with much to think about.  Given the chance and the ability which would you prefer:  serenity or stronger emotions?  How much of your own culture, your own peer pressure and competition, the structures in which you live serves you rather than you serving them?  How much of you is hidden?  How much that you could see and appreciate in others' lives and characters is hidden from you by the artifice which you yourself embrace?",1430092800,,1379,4.708333333333333

It is quintessentially Japanese, by which I mean it is layered and subtle. What I thought was a straightforward fairy tale was anything but, and it gently pulls on all your emotions before it's over.

It does recall to my mind the Babymetal song Megitsune, which goes in part

Inishie no otome-tachi yo
karisome no yume ni odoru.
Ikusen no toki o koete
ima o ikiru

Ancient maidens,
You dance in the transient dream
Getting over thousands of years,
You live today

Really shows how an anime can tell the complex story without the flash of American animators. No 3D, no realistic animation, but really an emotional and layered tale. Quite the movie. Highly recommended.

For a movie that is really a children's movie, don't be too afraid of the emotional content for the little ones. I once had a get together at my house, and one of the parents put in Princess Mononoke in the DVD player to entertain the wee ones, and they just ate it up.

6808682,5,B00PHSDS0E,"An absolute stunner of a film. It's watercolor and inkbrush wholesomeness belay a raw intensity and power that even the most skilled director can only ever hope pull off. This really is one hell of a film.

Produced at the same famed studio, at the same time, as The Wind Rises, this movie succeeds head and shoulders where its cousin fails. Both are supposed final films of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki and both are seeped with similar personal themes that resonate through both films: misunderstandings, remorse, longing, and nostalgia. How misunderstandings in life affect what we love and cause us to long for something that is forever lost and unobtainable.

Where they differ is execution. The Wind Rises is considerably more sentimental, unfocused, and heavy-handed in its message. This, like the film's artwork, evokes a strong, emotional connection on a more infinitely subtle connection. Like remembering a long-forgotten, beloved image from youth and suddenly crashing to the realization that those days are far behind you now.

There is magic without it seeming forced or made too mystical, there is a raw emotional power that doesn't feel contrived, a psychological motif that resonates like a plucked string, all wrapped beautifully and delicately in trappings of eastern folklore. Even with all this praise, I cannot help but think they are not doing this film justice; this truly is something you must see to behold.

If there is one drawback to this film (for native English-speaking westerners, at least), it's the English dubbing for it. It's not atrocious but it is, like in many instances, bad in the sense that there is something lost in translation. Where meaning and intent from the original language is lost when it is ported over to the closest-meaning relative in the English language. In this particular instance, the impact and lyrical nature of the the original Japanese is wholly lost in the dub. I sincerely recommend seeing it in the original Japanese with subtitles.

That said, this is the perfect film to end a lifelong career with. That's something not a whole lot of filmmakers have; even some of the greatest. It's beautiful, poignant, elegant, mesmerizing, and a sure-to-be classic.",1429574400,5,2226,5.104395604395604

6808687,5,B00PHSDS0E,"This film is easily my favorite Studio Ghibli film ever, and that says a lot considering how many times I've viewed My Neighbor Totoro.  Takahata made the most achingly beautiful film, and every detail was just so.  The film has a lot of depth and meaning, too, I was so moved.  Takahata knew the film ending would have sadness, so he filled it with details to comfort viewers, too.  The whole story is this beauty and affirming allegory for life.  And oh the music!

The companion disc, which is a documentary on how Princess Kaguya was made is also worthy of 5-stars. In fact, watch the movie, watch the companion disk, watch the movie, and only THEN watch the movie release extra bonus footage on the movie disc.  The companion disc is the most fascinating look at the creative process, innovation, the whole Japanese animation film scene, director Takahata, how you make a movie, how you overcome obstacles, etc.  One thing I loved about seeing the companion disc is how it affirmed that so many things I loved about the movie were deliberate decisions made by Takahata, that he and his crew literally slaved over to get just right.  It was delightful to hear him speaking with the musical director and telling him he had to change the piece to overlay a much more complex emotion, and the music director being such a professional, he just went and redid it -- and it was such magic what he did.

Because the animation was so innovative, Takahata had to set up a separate studio completely on its own outside of Studio Ghibli.  He always felt the energy of the rough drawings was lost as the animation process was refined, so he found ways to retain that energy, but it made the animation process really difficult because it was so different.

6808696,5,B00PHSDS0E,"He is 80 years old and took six years to make this movie. An acclaimed film director that has only made five full-length pictures. Both his first and this, his last, are often regarded as masterpieces.
In all five one finds, with varying emphasis, the main themes of: family, love, joy sorrow, duty, and fate. And all five pictures, made in very different styles, are beautifully drawn and colored.
His first movie: The Grave of the Fireflies, a tragic story set in wartime Japan and based on a novel about real-life events, is so excruciatingly sad that, while much admired, there are few hardy enough to watch it more than once.
The three in the middle: Pom Poko, My Neighbors the Yamadas and Only Yesterday, are lighter in tone. His recurring themes are still there, but muted, like distant rumblings of thunder that, very occasionally, can be close, loud and dramatic; while meaning to amuse and entertain, he is still murmuring something serious in them about life and our times.
Along with a few others I can think of, such as Disney, Miyazaki and Bird, this man: Isao Takahata, has redefined the idea of animated movies, from either safe entertainment for children or broad comedy for grownups, into that of a serious and important contemporary art form.
If you have not seen Kaguya already, do yourself a favor: buy or rent, but don't miss it.
Just don't expect it to be fast and action-packed, with plenty of crash, flash and boom, or cute characters. I enjoy those well enough, but this one is something else.

It has the bittersweet thread that seems to run through all of Takahata's work, but still manages to be sweet, touching, and even funny when it counts.

6808699,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Gardeners will move plants to new settings, trim part, and encourage other parts to grow, in order to keep the plant alive and healthy. The same thing keeps old stories alive and healthy - in this case, the story of Kaguya. More or less by coincidence, I recently saw the story set in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/language-of-dance/dp/B00005Y6ZF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">language of dance</a>, and again set in an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/updated-kind-of-family/dp/B000HC2LSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">updated kind of family</a>.

This puts the story in a new setting yet again, an animation in wonderful, painterly style. And, as in other renderings, this encourages its own set of themes to grow: the father's confusion of his wants vs. Kaguya's, the mother's low-key but deep affection, and all the wrong motives of her suitors. It develops some of the minor characters, too, especially Kaguya's maid and childhood friends.

But really, what drew me in was the spare, expressive style of the animation. It feels almost as if I've walked into a living watercolor. The hand-drawn style lets the creators render Kaguya's adoptive parents almost as pudgy teddy bears, her high-caste teacher in a style of classic beauty, and Kaguya herself as elegant and waif-like. If you expect a certain look from Studio Ghibli, this might be a surprise. But, if you expect the highest in artistry and story-telling, you'll find plenty in this one.

Unfortunately I was a little bit underwhelmed by Princess Kaguya,
Without having any spoilers, the first half is really good but the second half is incredibly empty.

The most strange thing is how I knew almost nothing about the main character by the time the credits rolled.
She seems to be just blank, someone reacting to the world indirectly with no real personality.

Its very perplexing as to what exactly is wrong with this movie I may just be missing something.
Its worth watching this movie just so you can try and figure it out.
(EDIT) After thinking on this for quite a while, I have decided that the issue is how much of a downer this movie is.
Wile there is nothing wrong with it having a serious tone, I think my expectations were off. Most Studio Ghibli movies bring a smile to my face just thinking about them, this one just sort of makes me sad.
It may be because it hits hard on real world issues that are still going on. Like extreme poverty and child brides.

Bottom line, this is worth renting. But I don't know if there would be any reason to buy it on Blu-ray other than to complete the set.

6808732,5,B00PHSDS0E,"SHE IS from the moon, and found, Thumbelina-size, asleep in a glowing stalk of bamboo by an old man.
So begins Isao Takahatas adaptation of an ancient Japanese story, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter  and it is a beautiful, if bittersweet, delight from Studio Ghibli and Universal Studios. It is also one of five delightful animated films nominated for this years Academy Awards.
We followed some of its creation in The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, a documentary by Mami Sunada that follows Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, both in their 70s, during a year at Studio Ghibli as they worked on their individual films  Miyazaki on The Wind Rises and Takahata on The Tale of Princess Kaguya.
They are old friends and colleagues, but their styles couldn't be more different. Miyazaki, at 73, is a driven task-master, organized and deadline conscious. Takahata, 78, is also a gifted genius, but with a more artistic temperament. Its been 14 years since his last animated film and took eight years to complete Princess Kaguya. Like Michelangelo, Takahatas work is done when its done, and, as we see in a stand-alone documentary on DVD, keeps a team of producers, headed by Yoshiaki Nishimura, on their toes. At one point, production lagged so far behind, animators were laid off while storyboards and backgrounds were finalized.
The results are worth it. Takahata continues to use a painterly method for Princess Kaguya, a technique he initiated with the comedy, My Neighbors the Yamadas. Weve recently seen it utilized in Ernest & Celestine (2012) from France. The look depends on sketch art and water color, which, as several Studio Ghibli artists put it, is very hard to work with. Even when using the same paper and color to paint blue skies and clouds, each drawing will be different. No two watercolors can look alike.
But the resulting visuals of Princess Kaguya are unique and beautiful. The medium doesnt supply sharp detail or color, but the overall effect is lovely, a haunting tribute to fairy tales of old. The old bamboo cutter, voiced by Takeo Chii in the Japanese audio and James Caan in the splendid English dub, is enchanted with the tiny foundling who morphs into a baby. So is his kind and gentle wife, voiced by Nobuko Miyamoto and Mary Steenburgen, who also provide narration. (The partial nudity in the rating refers to a close-up of Kaguyas new mother nursing the baby.) Kaguya begins to grow into a young girl  magically  and becomes a favorite of the village. And, as the old man finds more and more magical gifts among the bamboo  gold and beautiful silk kimonos  he determines that the child is a princess and should be raised as such.
It sounds like a great idea, and parents will understand why he wants a better life for his child. The old man uses the gold to build a fabulous home in the capital city and transports his family there. He hires a noble lady of the court, Sagami (Atsuko Takahata, Lucy Liu), to teach Kaguya all a true princess should know. He means nothing but the best, but life among the nobles is a confining misery for the women. Soon, both Kaguya and her mother long for the simplicity and warmth of their old village and friends. We keep hoping Kaguya will return there, but it never quite happens. Meanwhile, the girl wows the local priests and nobles; even the Mikado (Shichinosuke Nakamura, Dean Cain) wants to marry her, but Kaguya wants none of this much to her fathers dismay. As in Studio Ghibli films such as My Neighbor Totoro and Princess Mononoke, the role of nature and freedom is a big part of the story, and key to Kaguyas happiness. The conclusion is unlike any animated princess story seen before and is well worth your time. Young women in particular should appreciate Kaguyas melancholy.
The 1080p transfer delivers Takahatas gorgeous visuals perfectly. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack only enhances the experience, whether you watch it in Japanese or English. Ambient sound from the countryside and cityscape create authentic surround experiences. The original score by is a delight, as are his observations found in the 86-minute standard-def documentary, Isao Takahata and His Tale of the Princess Kaguya. Takahata doesnt as much know what he wants in the score as what he doesnt, Hisaishi observes when the artist rejects a composition asking  again  for new work.
The documentary is a short version of a longer piece and seems odd its only available in SD. Still, what we get is detailed, following Takahata from beginning to completion of the film. It doesnt shy away from the rough stuff  like the layoff, producers continual concern and determination, or the artists frustrating creative process. (Its like the missing piece of Sunadas Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, which concentrated on Miyazaki and The Wind Rises.)
The Announcement of the Completion of the Film is a 40-minute documentary featuring a press conference and panel of crew and voice artists. Its available in HD on the Blu-ray disc and again, in SD, on the DVD extras disc included in Universals Blu-ray and DVD presentation.
Engaging both heart and mind, Takahatas Princess Kaguya is an animation masterpiece and not to be missed.   Kay Reynolds",1426896000,5,5188,4.870748299319728

6808735,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Another reviewer said this film effortlessly weaves together so many elements of happiness, bliss, family, love, loss and compromise (I threw in some of my own words), and I couldn't agree more. The story is in a traditional Japanese style, rich with culture and history while also quick to keep the quick pace entertaining and exciting. The animation is beautiful, in the simple hand-drawn style of ""My Neighbors the Yamadas"" that utilizes a lot of blank space. All the important and necessary elements are drawn in screen in the simplest form, which keeps your eye focused on what matters in each scene. I am not a Japanese folklore buff, so the story went a tiny bit over my head, but I enjoyed it 100% regardless. This will go down as a masterpiece for Studio Ghibli right alongside my personal favorite ""Spirited Away"". Lastly, this probably isn't something young children would enjoy, in case you're wondering. But if you're an animation lover, and want to spend 2 hours of your life immersed in the most magical animated scenery, with loveable characters and a creative folk tale, you must watch ""Kaguya"".

It is very, very drawn out and the main character is by no means a good person. Very self-absored behavior that gets pretty annoying to watch.

6808753,5,B00PHSDS0E,"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a film that truly surprised me.  I own nearly all of Studio Ghibli's feature films, especially the works of Hayao Miyazaki who I've always been partial to when it comes to animated films, but anything with Ghibli's name on it is something I consider a must-watch.  So I watched this, knowing nothing of the folktale that it's based on, and found myself experiencing a profound emotional journey, one I never expected.

In brief summary, the story begins with a bamboo cutter, a small aging man, who one day finds a tiny girl inside a chute of bamboo--and I mean like a little doll girl.  He takes her home, and he and his wife decide they will raise her as her own, calling her a princess.  The story, as you might guess, is about her, as she struggles with her identity, with the life she wants compared to the one she is thrust into, and in many ways is about her finding herself, knowing nothing of her origins, which play a pivotal part in the story but which would be a spoiler to give away, so that's all I'll say about it.

The animation here is stunning and unique, done almost like a rough but organized and masterful sketch, ever in motion.  There's never a dull moment because of it, either in animation or in the increasingly engaging story.  There were some scenes that were simply arresting, captivating, for the animation alone, and the voice acting is excellent.  The story ranges from intriguing, to meditative, to compulsively entertaining, to funny and even playfully hilarious, to surprisingly saddening--this movie is, as I said above, quite a profound emotional experience.  Perhaps because I wasn't expecting it, it really dug into my heart and left quite the lasting impression on me, and as soon as the credits rolled I knew I was in for an interesting week of this movie's effect on me.  The music, the animation, the characters, the story--all of it is masterful and absolutely beautiful.

The little girl grows fast, too fast by normal human standards, and is already a young girl when her father also finds fine robes and garments in the bamboo forest, as well as many pieces of gold, and believes this is heaven's way of telling him to move to the capital so he can raise his daughter like the real princess she must be.  There, renamed Kaguya, the girl - growing quickly to young womanhood - excels in her learning and artistic skills, as well as charms everyone around her.

6808768,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Just finished, along with Jeff H., watching ""The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya"" released by Studio Ghibli.
When I was in elementary school, I loved reading all the collections of fairy tales from around the world - especailly Japanese fairy tales because they were usually so sad.  I still wished I had those volumes of fairy tales collected from a variety of nations.
I had previously read ""The Moon Princess"" or as it was sometimes called, ""The Bamboo Cutter's Daughter,"" in its translated form decades ago - and various versions of this particular Japanese fairy tale of love and hope gained and lost by oridnary mortals.
The Pricness Kaguya breaks the rules governing the lives of the Lunar Dieties and comes to Earth to exprience it's joys and sorrows.  In the original fairy tale, the infant Moon Princess is sent to Earth as punishment for running amok in the King's Garden.
""The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya"" is a faithful adaptation of that sparse fairy tale.  The Moon Princess grows into a beautiful woman who tries to fit into the world that her adoptive parents want her to belong to; but she rebels, and then makes an attempt to conform to be the ""perfect mortal princess."" yet in the end, she remains true to herself; which renders her world asunder when the Moon Dieties intervene to recall her back to her rightful place on the moon - breaking her adoptive parents' hearts and her's too, since she doesn't want to leave the Earth.
Studio Ghibli and Isao Takamata have created an understated masterpiece the explores the conditions of the human; and not so human hearts, that long for love and acceptance.

6808772,5,B00PHSDS0E,"The Tale of Princess Kaguya is arguably the finest film released by Studio Ghibli. Director Isao Takahara continues to break from the usual look so closely associated with Ghibli films and crafted a film that explores the richness of Japanese folklore and history while examining the human spirit. Kaguya hime is a Japanese folktale almost every Japanese school child knows. Isao has chose to set the film during the Heian era of Japan - a time considered by many to be the cultural zenith of Japanese history. This creates the perfect setting for a visually spectacular film.

The story tells the tale Of a Poor bamboo cutter who finds a glowing bamboo stock that has a small child inside. He and his wife choose to raise this child who grows rapidly from infant to child to adult. Believing that the child is sent from the heavens the bamboo plans on ultimately making her a princess. They are rewarded for their efforts in raising the girl by uncovering gold in the bamboo grove. The movie Follows the princess' struggles growing up and coping with society.

I found the film fascinating because it dealt with a very basic human issues. The director does not shy away from anything in a child's upbringing and shows scenes of breast-feeding and discusses her first period.  We also learn about Heian era beauty as the princess is instructed in the art of shaving off her eyebrows, blackening her teeth, and walking on her knees almost all the time. There are details shown regarding the mundane such as how pottery and bowls were made during this time. The animation has a loose, watercolor look to but the emotions the protagonist feels as she goes through these changes are clearly conveyed.

This film is gorgeous and entertaining. Truly a masterpiece.",1425081600,2,1758,4.811258278145695
6808773,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Whoa! When I spotted this dvd in Wall Mart I  purchased it after watching THE WIND RISES by Miyazaki and Wow! It is such an expressive and beautifully drawn animation! Both this film and THE WIND RISES are excellent hand drawn movies with a differant drawing style. The Princess Kaguya was found by a wood cutter in a bamboo shoot and the girl grows rapidly as she ages! The other kids name her ""Little Bamboo"" while the adoptive father insists she is a princess and has her raised by nobility.

Directer Takahata has a different style of directing then Miyazaki, he does not do any drawing while Miyazaki draws all the storyboards and Takahata records the voices first and then does the animation to them while Miyazaki animates first and then records the voices onto the finished artwork. Yet both men in their 70s have an expressive style in their animation! While computer 3D dominates in the United States, in the far east 2D Hand drawn continues to thrive. An hour an 25 min. documentary on the making of PRINCESS KAGUYA shows the japanese artists painstakingly making the hand drawn animation on paper before it is coloured by computer and supimposed on top of backround paintings! My DVD looked great on my analog Toshiba 26 inch tv with converter box and digital signals!

When the princess reveals she has to go back to the moon on the 15th day there is much sadness with her adoptive parents but she goes back reluctantly with a grand parade into the sky and the stars with beautiful spirits to the moon! The english dub is very well voiced with James Cann as the woodcutter, Lucy Luu as the noble teacher and Mary Stennburgen as the wood cutter's wife but it also has a fine vocal by japanese actors on the alternate track!

While Miyazaki has announced his retirement both his work and the work of Takahata show there is much life left in 2D hand drawn animation! Highly recommended!",1425081600,,1896,4.633928571428571

6808779,5,B00PHSDS0E,"An absolutely brilliant film; enchanting in its style of animation, to be sure, but equally endearing because of the innocence with which it relates a profound message of mortality. Death is, of course, at the core of all life, and its effects on the living are, if we adopt a cynical view by ignoring the experience of the dead after life (which the film does not do, but nor does it explore this unknowable realm), pervasive, as James Joyce communicated so eloquently in Dubliners. This is a tale for children and adults, and its style does not, like Joyce, make its message weighty or particularly solemn. It is affecting, to be sure, but gently and optimistically so. Without spoiling the plot, I must say that the end sequence is simply sublime, but so lovingly animated and portrayed so as to to be both sad and happy, as one who truly believes in a second part to life's journey must feel when thinking of mortality. Whilst the tale that inspired this film is quite old, the film manages to infuse it with a life that makes it immensely worthwhile and entertaining viewing.",1424649600,3,1080,4.659685863874346

It's a wonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it.  The art is simply breathtaking, definitely one of my all time favorite Studio Ghbli movies.

The 1080p encode looks great!  The colors are somewhat muted, but thats the way its suppose to look.  Any imperfections you might notice come from the source drawings.  The whole thing looks amazing, its like watching a painting come to life

For audio you get two choices, a pair of DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio tracks (english & Japanese) both of which are excellent.

6808781,4,B00PHSDS0E,The animation style is like a comic book coming to life. A nice look at a Japanese fairy tale. It challenges the thought process of doing what your family thinks is right for you and doing what is actually right for you. Quick and clever the main character is fun and strong. Not your typical story line.,1424563200,,304,4.350877192982456
6808782,5,B00PHSDS0E,"The three disk Blu Ray-DVD combo of Isao Takahata's The Tale of the Princess Kaguya released by Universal Studios on  February 17, 2015 is the edition you want to own.  It is superior to the Japanese blu ray because it includes  an abbreviated version of the making of Feature ""Isao Takahata and His Tale of The Princess Kaguya."" You get about half of the original three hour and twenty minute feature.

First, there is the background art.  Kazou Oga, the Art Director, and nine others were responsible for the background art. Poster paint is usually the kind of paint used for the backgrounds in Ghibli's animation, but for Princess Kaguya, water colors were used.  The results are beautiful.  Osamu Tanabe, responsible for the character design and the Directing Animator and the animators then had to match their animation style to background style to create a unified picture.  Two other people, Yukiko Kakati (in charge of color setting the Tanabe's animation, and Keiuke Nakamura (in charge of Digital Imaging)  also contributed to the uniformity of the look of the feature.

The result of this is that The Tale Princess Kaguya looks a lot more like the animation of Frederick Back or Alexander Petrov than it looks like other Studio Ghibli animation.

The original story was a satire of matrimonial negotiations among the feudal lords of ninth and tenth century Japanese nobles.  To this Takahata and Riko Sakaguchi  added the story of the woodcutters and Sutemaru.  If this makes for a choppy story, well the original was choppy as well.

Readers of Takahata's 1999 book Twelfth Century Animation (a book comparing Japanese Picture Scrolls to current animation techniques) will no doubt identify the 13 century painting given on pg. 59 as the original for final sequence where the Princess returns to the moon.

Another person who should get a lot of the credit, Yoshiaki Nishimura, the Producer, who took things in hand, and made difficult choices and saw the project through to completion.  To say the production did not go smoothly would be an understatement.

This is the kind of feature that people are going to have strong reactions to. Because it is different, very different from other Ghibli animation, you're either going to love or hate it.  There probably won't be much middle ground.

Two other books both in Japanese are also worth looking at: ""The Art of Princess Kaguya,"" and ""Studio Ghibli Storyboards 20 Princess Kaguya.""",1424476800,5,2446,4.977832512315271

The start of the film with its classic and high quality animation is in Takahata style magnificent but the ending oh the ending. It could be something is lost in translation but the hopelessness and pointlessness of the ending is to say the least jarring. Could it be Takahata is railing against Buddhist ideology in the way he railed against war in ""Grave of the Fireflies""?

6808786,5,B00PHSDS0E,"The box itself says that it's a ""Staggering Masterpiece"" and it honestly left me staggering at many points and left me wishing I understood more of the cultural and historical context, and more about the original story.

The whole movie is steeped in cultural references, for example just a few minutes into the movie there are references to growing seasons, and when things bloom, the Bamboo Cutter says ""I've never seen a Bamboo shoot before the plum blossoms,"" and the movie illustrates the passage of time though what's blooming, something unfamiliar to those of us in the US. Even still, the movie explains much of the nuance of the time through Princess Kaguya's instructor so it doesn't leave you lost.

I do greatly appreciate many of the feminist undertones throughout the movie, one of the reasons I wish I'd been more familiar with the original, as they're powerful denouncements of the traditional Japanese way of thinking. My jaw dropped when I head Kaguya's reaction to her teacher in the  middle of the movie.

The art style, as mentioned in many other reviews, is truly unique, and masterfully rendered. What caught my eye was the use of the background as another way of expressing emotion in the scene. It's sparse during the melancholy times, and rich during the more joyful times. Of course, the attention to detail remains as with any Ghibli film. Little Bamboo struggling to carry two bamboo shoots, sets one down, and misses the basket trying to put one in the first time.

Some say the movie's melancholy is unusual for Ghibli, but I feel melancholy is present many films, punctuated by a deep sense of loss, even when wrapped in hope and happiness. Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and of course the Wind Rises are perfect examples of this.",1424217600,10,1765,4.850498338870432

6808789,5,B00PHSDS0E,"Looking back to the Heian Era (about a thousand years ago), it was never allowed for Japanese women to execute their rights to make a choice, nor to live independently. Rather, since people in those days could hardly even imagine such acts, it would never happen for women to refuse the Emperor's courtship.

Princess Kaguya, appeared in the oldest Japanese tale, has first proposed the women's lifestyle to live of their own, taken for granted nowadays. Therefore she can be recognized as the ""super"" pioneer role model of today's women. However, the fact that such way of life doesn't necessarily promise a simple happy end may well induce the sympathy of women.

It is possibly difficult to conduct the background research of the Heian Era properly, so we often see a lot of weird descriptions about such ancient life in films even in live-action ones. Although the hand-drawing methods purposely used in this film are retrograde ones, by taking literally tremendous amount of years and cost, this film completely sweeps away such half-bakeness accompanied with normal commercial films and successfully describe the life scenes at that time with genuine realities.

Of course, although I have never seen ""the life scenes at that time"" before, beautiful and plentiful visual expressions, particularly in unique depicting techniques evoking our imagination, bring me a plausible feeling like ""oh, this is what it used to be like"". For instance, like that the appearance of a palace is the reminiscent of the Daikaku temple in Kyoto indeed built in the Heian Era, countless details also give the firm basis for the world construction.

If you feel like eating fill of hamburgers or pizzas, see whatever entertainment film you like including Hayao Miyzaki's animation. On the other hand, if you feel like tasting traditional and graceful cuisine, unfortunately alternative choices are quite limited these days.
In this sense, this film is the extremely scarce one.",1424044800,,1963,5.163522012578617

6808792,5,B00PHSDS0E,"I hardly know where to start with this movie. All I can really say is wow. This was such a fantastic movie. It makes me so sad that Takahata is retired now but man what a way to end! I have known about this movie for six or more years and I tell you it was well worth the wait!

Takahata is well known for having profound, deep, and often heartbreaking movies. He is not like Miyazaki in that there is always a happy ending and people find love, inner clarity, renewal, or self actualization. Takahata will explore the harsher, deeper facts of life and not every movie ends on a happy note. This movie will wow you and also break your heart.

This movie is based off the old Japanese tale of the Bamboo Cutter. It goes roughly that there is an old bamboo cutter who one days finds a beautiful baby girl in a stalk he cuts down. He takes her home, raises her, loves her, and he affectionately comes to call her The Bamboo Princess. She grows to become the most beautiful girl in Japan. Everyone from all over the country is coming to ask for her hand in marriage, but she refuses them all. One day, the bamboo cutter receives proposals from five princes, all asking for her hand. The Bamboo Princess devises a clever idea to invite them all over and ask of each of them an impossible task, saying only then would she marry one of them. They all return with fakes and she dismisses them all. Finally, the emperor himself learns of her beauty and travels to meet her. He falls in love with her and asks for her hand in marriage. She comes to care for him too but refuses his offer as well. In the next few days, she comes to reveal that she is a daughter of the moon people, sent to Earth as punishment for some crime and made to form attachments she would have to abandon. She informs her parents and the emperor that she must leave soon. Distraught, they all fight to protect her from the moon people, but the princess says that she and them must accept that she needs to return. Before she leaves, she drinks the elixir of life, given to her by her people, and then gives the rest to the emperor along with a farewell note. She then has a moon robe placed on her and she instantly forgets her sadness and her memory of them. After she leaves, the emperor asks his best soldiers to climb the highest mountain to burn the note and the elixir she gave him, hoping that the smoke will travel up to her in the heavens.

This movie is based off this story and takes some creative and moving twists to it as well. Takahata took a classic and reinvented it as an amazing story that will make you both laugh and cry. This is a must see for everyone of all ages, a movie that you will not soon forget. I think it is one of my new favorite Studio Ghibli movies to date.",1423526400,6,2758,4.209829867674858

6808797,5,B00PHSDS0E,"This movie is studio ghibli's rendition of the classic japanese tale where a girl from the moon is raised by the family of a bamboo cutter and I must say that the work is a masterpiece. At first glance, it does not even look like a studio ghibli work because the art style is very traditional in contrast to the usual art style they use but I feel like it was beneficial to the film. It added to the overall aesthetic beauty of the film. You can tell that the makers put a lot of care and love to the making of the work. The music as well was astonishing and deserves praise. There isn't a lot of tracks but the very few that they use are gorgeous and really do strike a chord(No pun intended). Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is not as happy go lucky like most ghibli films. There is a feeling of melancholy throughout the film and sometimes it can be outright saddening. The movie will make you think about the world and how unfair life can be. I have compiled a list of themes that the movie covers that one should pay attention to when watching but there will be no spoilers given away:

Nature/Freedom: Nature plays a big role in the film and intertwines around the life of Kaguya. It can be representative of the freedom or lack of freedom in her life.

The Role of Women in society: Studio Ghibli has a reputation for giving feminist messages in their films and they clearly evoke that in this film. Though the time period is a couple of hundred years away from the modern era, it can be assumed that the same implications can be used as a parallel to the stereotypes women face that have been established through years of repression.

Social Class Structure: The film illustrates the differences in social class structure and how one discriminates against the other. It also shows the discrimination against the rise of lower status individuals to a higher status.

I truly loved this film for its artistic beauty and the plot. It is one of the best animated films of all time in my opinion. I applaud Studio Ghibli for taking such a high risk and giving the world a piece of their stellar and magnificent message to its viewers.",1420243200,74,2149,4.432911392405063
6808798,5,B00PHSDS0E,"I think this is one of the best films of all time.

It's a lovely version of a Japanese folk tale that's central to Japanese culture.

I think it's also probably somehow about the death of the director's baby sister, World War II, tsunamis, environmental destruction, and maybe everything else. If you look at it hard enough the right way, maybe everything that matters is in this film.

Every line of dialogue is necessary, lovely, natural and fresh.

Every character comes alive in the first two or three seconds of screen time.

The film is never anything but humble. If you want it to just be a cute kids' film, it can be a cute kids' film. If you try to screen Grave of the Fireflies for children under 12, you have to ask yourself if you should put the burden of seeing that film on children's innocent shoulders. You can let children watch this film to the end, if they'll put up with its lack of bling, but maybe everything that really matters about that film is somehow in this film, too.

This film should win every award it's eligible to win.

I'm not saying that everyone will like this film. I've had problems getting into many of the classics I've read. But this film is as much a classic in its own way as Hamlet or the Divine Comedy.

If this film's weak box office actually killed off Studio Ghibli, I have this to say to the folks at Studio Ghibli: it's terrifying to have to hunt for work and struggle to pay the bills, but this film is a gorgeous, wonderful film. This film was worth the gamble. Audiences are fickle. Money is fickle. Awards are fickle. But you made something true and good and beautiful with this film, and no one can take that away from you. Whatever else happens in life, you helped give life to this film. I am so sorry making something so beautiful does not automatically lead to financial success.",1419724800,147,1840,4.423076923076923

It's visual style of using the rough drawings of the great animator who works side by side with Tanaka so that whole film has a breathtaking life and force which is special in the world of great animation. Its coulours are watercolour wash , so the visual is more like a Japanese brush painting than solid hard line animation. Tanaka's story is clear and folk-driven softness; the  characters are alive with gentle detail and filled with the spirit of life. Finally the rhythm is not that of a typical movie or book, more akin to the rising and falling of an opera ( although there is no false formality as in great opera) ; It's action swells to huge visual and character climaxes and then falls to a gentle play only to lurch again to heights.

8688050,4,B00PHSDS0E,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere. Although Miyazaki wasn't in the director's chair this time around, director Isao Takahata presents us a beautifully animated story, and considering this was the last film he directed before his passing, it's an amazing film to ""go out on"" as it were.

A bamboo cutter is out working the fields when he discovers a miniature girl inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her ""Princess"". The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, causing her parents to marvel and earning her the nickname ""Little Bamboo"" from the other village children.  The girl lives a happy, carefree childhood, until her father comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove in the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He relocates the family to the capital, forcing her to leave her friends behind. Soon, the girl,  now named ""Princess Kaguya"", begins to struggle with her self-identity as she's unwillingly groomed for royalty....and the more her supernatural powers start to emerge, the more she realizes she'll have to confront the reasons she came to Earth to begin with...and the forces coming to take her back.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Ghibli film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and it makes scenes come alive in such a way that the lines between fantasy and reality become more and more blurred. What makes this film stand out even more from Studio Ghibli's other movies is the art style. Rather than traditional animation, it takes the form of a moving watercolor painting---giving the film a very unique feel, as if we're watching a storybook come to life.

As for the story, it's apparently based off one of the oldest stories in Japanese folklore, ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.""  And after researching it, the film is actually extremely faithful to the old story. Without spoiling much, it could also be seen as one of history's first science fiction stories, and I can agree with that opinion, considering that I was constantly drawing parallels to Superman throughout watching this (being from another world, lands on Earth, raised by a kind couple on a farm, has superpowers, etc.). Kaguya herself is a very likeable character, and despite her supernatural origins, anyone could still relate to her and her struggle to figure out her place in the world. Though her father is well meaning and just wants what's best for her, it's clear that Kaguya grows exponentially miserable when she isn't allowed to do the things that truly make her happy. And when her supernatural origins finally catch up with her, she's left with the difficult choice of either remaining on Earth or returning to her people.

With amazing animation, this is an interesting take on one of the earliest fairy tales ever written, and even though the story is so old, it still holds up even to this day, with important lessons in staying true to yourself, learning what true love really is, what it means to be human, forging a family no matter where you come from, and that for all the bad things in the world, there's an equal and even greater amount of good.",1528070400,,3583,4.7974068071312805
