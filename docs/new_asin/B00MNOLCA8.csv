6590264,1,B00MNOLCA8,"Love the show but you get what you pay for. Lower quality video....not horrible but not great.
The first disc for season 6has some problems. I own DVD and blu Ray players and they both show the exact same problem of freezing in the first chapter of the 3rd episode of season 6.
Not worth returning or i would.",1418256000,3,309,4.254237288135593

6590281,4,B00MNOLCA8,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are no extras on the DVDs and the packaging is very primitive. The 4 discs are stacked on top of each other in the space normally reserved for 1 disc. Other than that, this is a great deal! Two seasons for $7 and some change--hard to beat that!",1431648000,,307,3.967741935483871
6590282,3,B00MNOLCA8,Good seasons.  Not as funny as first 2 though,1431561600,,45,4.0
6590283,4,B00MNOLCA8,It was a great package but the episodes are not in order:(,1431388800,,58,3.9166666666666665

6590285,4,B00MNOLCA8,"well it has 4 dvd's however they are cheaply put in the box, there is no divider,they are just stacked together, it however did not have any scratches on the dvd itself but had scatches around the hole on one dvd, of course seeing as how they didn't stack them right it was a good possibility,you are not supposed to stack dvd's picture to bottom as it can scratch them. i guess they learned from season 1-4 cuz these has season five, and season six on it, plus names of the episodes on front, an says disc one and two",1431043200,,518,4.19
6590286,4,B00MNOLCA8,Great Classic show that is still funny to this day.  All DVD packages came sealed and are in working order.  The only thing i thought was done cheap was that the discs are all stacked on one spool which could cause them to scratch in the future so knowing that i am very careful with them.,1431043200,,289,4.142857142857143
6590287,5,B00MNOLCA8,Love the show,1430956800,,13,3.6666666666666665
6590288,5,B00MNOLCA8,"Beats all the other seasons.
Seriously the most funniest and memorable episodes trust me I'm psychic.",1430870400,,101,5.375
6590289,5,B00MNOLCA8,"If you're ""Al -in"" for Al, you'll love these episodes, hand down.  What a show.  What cultural icons, capturing a decade of life in these disintegrating United States...",1429747200,,169,5.0

6590293,4,B00MNOLCA8,"Plenty of laughs per episode. It's not the most sophisticated of shows, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine.",1427760000,,107,4.684210526315789
6590294,5,B00MNOLCA8,Very Good,1427760000,,9,4.0
6590295,5,B00MNOLCA8,It's a good series with writing that is sometimes fairly clever. The four main roles are classics and I personally enjoy the Chicago connection with Buckingham Fountain starting every program.,1426982400,2,192,5.433333333333334
6590296,5,B00MNOLCA8,"Very affordable compared to most sellers. Packaging and details from the case to the DVD's themselves are excellent quality. Quality is no different from when the show was in syndication. But, that doesn't bother me one bit. Plus, you're getting 2 seasons in this package!",1426809600,3,272,5.066666666666666
6590297,5,B00MNOLCA8,Married With Children is my favorite show.,1425340800,,42,5.142857142857143
6590298,5,B00MNOLCA8,Best show ever for the best price ever. Has the original theme music sand by Frank Sinatra,1424995200,,90,4.352941176470588
6590299,5,B00MNOLCA8,"Love the show. Wanted to buy for my collection for my summer home (no cable, etc.). Price was great, but worried about the quality. Well, I wasn't disappointed. Quality is great. Theme song at the beginning. Great buy. Very happy.",1423094400,2,230,4.775
6590300,5,B00MNOLCA8,aa must see,1423094400,,11,3.0
6590301,5,B00MNOLCA8,loved this show when it was on TV and it's still good.  My only complaint is season 9 seems to be a stand alone and is outrageously priced. You can buy a complete DVD set for less than the single season 9.  I have up to season 8 and I will have to skip nine and go to 10 and 11 until I can find season nine for under $25.00,1423094400,,323,3.6
6590302,5,B00MNOLCA8,"Crude by times, very funny - hard to believe how controversial it was in its' day!",1423094400,,82,4.1875

6590307,5,B00MNOLCA8,Still funny after all these years,1420329600,,33,4.666666666666667
6590308,5,B00MNOLCA8,"Haven't gotten up this disc set yet but watch the show all the time on cable which is why I've been buying the series double seasons at their discounted price.  I love the satire of this show and would recommend it highly for good comedy one liners.  Al is the hard working shoe salesman that gets no respect.  Check this one out for a good time killer that will make people laugh out loud, remember this is an eighties show so it's just a plain props sit com, not a fancy special effects movie and all will be good.  The whole cast works well together but Marcy can be a bit annoying.",1420243200,,585,4.196428571428571

8673220,5,B00MNOLCA8,"Love the crude humor.  Appreciate the shallow story line.  Great show to just sit, watch and be mindless.",1502236800,,105,4.777777777777778
8673221,5,B00MNOLCA8,"yet another good set complete with the original intro song put back in with the only exception is that the door clank happens after Katie Sagal is on the intro, which makes it truly funny, the 2 season set finally has the actual seasons labeled this time so you can tell which season is which and all the favorite episodes are here in this season set, still same issues plague this set from the last 2 sets and the remaining sets a quick recap on that is all 4 discs are on one spindle and you should just save yourself time and buy a 4 disc box replacement to save the discs and make them look better, all in all a better price for 2 seasons and to remind anyone its not a remaster or remake just the original set squashed 2 discs per season so basically 14 episodes on 1 disc with the correct song in it, plus much nicer on shelves to go with other dvd or blu ray sets",1496880000,,870,4.063953488372093
