5793570,4,B00DDUF4G4,"Scandinavian crime thrillers are my forte, I love them. This new DVD series from Sweden has a promising beginning. We are used to police of all genre involved in the mysteries, now we have a journalist who is a crime reporter who is solving the crimes

.Based on the crime novels by Liza Marklund, this series follows Annika Bengtzon, played by Malin Cr&eacute;pin. She is a reporter for a Swedish newspaper, Kv&auml;llspressen. She is a dedicated reporter and loves her work. At the same time, she is married with two small children. The entire family is good looking, and everyone is vying for Annika's attention. Her bosses want her work, now, and her family wants her at home. We are treated to three interesting and sometimes engrossing episodes in this set. Annika is thwarted at every turn either by her family, her bosses or the police. But she is able to get around them, and in doing so, brings us along for the ride. The storylines are well done, but seem familiar. Filmed in Sweden with a Swedish cast, the series features excellent cinematography and production values. The stories are interesting; the time devoted to Bengtzon's pursuit of the story and the effect of her career on her personal life is well balanced; and the cast, especially Malin Cr&eacute;pin as Bengtzon, are effective.

The continuing story of her marriage and her life as a mother make Annika a much fuller character. Like the best of series, there is both an episode resolution and continuing character development. The show does an excellent job at showing how difficult a woman's working life can be. I found the second 3 episodes to b far more interesting and compelling than the first three episodes.

Mystery, personal intrigue, real world drama, dramatic locations, this is it. Malin Crepin is superb as Annika Bengtzon and lovely too. The actors in this are wonderfully cast and give truly riveting performances. Catch ""Annika' on Amazon Prime then get the DVD. This is worth watching over and over. On par with Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis, etc.",1395360000,,529,4.698924731182796

5793573,4,B00DDUF4G4,"This series is far better than its title (reminiscent of juvenile fiction) would lead one to believe. The series, adaptations of the books of Liza Marklund, comprises six 90-minute episodes, each representing a story that the main character, Annika Bengtzon, a crime reporter for a Stockholm newspaper, is pursuing. Each story is complete in itself, the threads that runs through them being the newspaper's staff and Bengtzon and her personal life. Filmed in Sweden with a Swedish cast (and thus with English subtitles), the series features excellent cinematography and high production values. The stories are interesting; the time devoted to Bengtzon's pursuit of the story and the effect of her career on her personal life is well balanced; and the cast, especially Malin Crpin as Bengtzon, are effective.",1387411200,,807,5.3125

5793575,4,B00DDUF4G4,"These stories are fun to watch, well filmed, and well acted.  The indestructibility of the heroine is a little too much to believe,
but if not for that there wouldn't be a next story, would there?",1384905600,,196,4.444444444444445
5793576,4,B00DDUF4G4,"At first I found this series wonderful. Beautiful young crime reporter with lovely family, but who has an obsession with nosing out the most muderous and
dangerous crimes and not only writing them up for her byline in her newspaper but dashing headlong into danger single-handedly, after which she comes out -- unscathed! And not even dirty.

The plots are uneven in quality. Some go by so fast I barely remember them. The characters also don't seem to have a scratch on them after a scuffle, leaving a bit of a surfacy, or cartoonish, sense and not a realistic one.

'Production values' are high: sets, locations,  and cinematography. Actors are all good. So directing is good. It's the stories that could use more imagination and plausibility.

I was kept watching by the evolving story of Annika's family, particularly her husband. Her kids as actors are equal to the other crew members. At her work I kept looking out for Annika's cohort, an older woman, who, as a character has first-hand history Annika doesn't have, helps her selflessly with research,  and is an excellent actor.

At work, as with the police, we don't see sexism. Respect is always welcome.

The episodes become repetitive and predictable. A murder happens. Annika abandons family plans and runs to cover it, gets in as deeply as she can, sees a plot snag that needs to be untangled or rushes in to save someone, 'almost gets killed', gets saved at the most breathless moment by the police (who share information with her
for the most part freely). Again, if Annika has been just been ruthlessly kicked by a criminal she nonetheless gets up and saves the day and her body shows no signs of wear.

I like series which change and move the character along in her life, a bigger story within which the episodic stories are contained. But there is not much of a macrostory, just self-contained episodes -- plus family. So, with the unimaginative plots, I would rate the two seasons 3 1/2. 4 for the official rating.",1382140800,2,1984,4.747093023255814

8592362,5,B00DDUF4G4,"Plots tend to be thin, but characters well-drawn and interesting and filming artful.  I like that the series seems to be slanted towards female viewers (me), as opposed to other mystery series.

8592363,4,B00DDUF4G4,"I really enjoyed this show. Great Scandinavian, understated feel. The cinematography is very beautiful, capturing crisp Nordic air (one episode is shot in Spain/Morocco).
I did not get the feeling which some of the reviewers mentioned, that Annika is a superwoman who gets out of troubles too easily. And I did not feel this show compares to ""Dragon Tattoo"" which I did feel way over the top, either. The story is not always strong and Annika does get out of troubles for the obvious reason, but she also makes mistakes and looks very vulnerable at times. Her monologue about her children at the end of ""Lifetime"" episode was so beautiful it made me want to learn Swedish, so that I could recite it word by word.

Malin Crepin is another European actress you no longer find in Hollywood. Beautiful yet not artificial, not surgically enhanced. She is gorgeous but could be someone you know, like the prettiest girl when you were in high school, and the glammed-up cover picture is somewhat misleading in that sense. She superbly infuses both pluckiness and fragility into the character.",1418688000,,1085,4.864864864864865

8592365,5,B00DDUF4G4,"I watched this on PBS, liked it so much I was compelled to write a review.  A TERRIFIC crime drama that gets everything right.  The scripts are smart, tight, with pleasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Columbo/dp/B008RJ6TTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Columbo</a>-like ""Of course- that makes perfect sense!"" resolutions (more often than not).  One of those rare shows with few wasted moments or lines, suspense building steadily, inexorably, all the while punctuated with subtle, nuanced glimpses into characters' realities, small particulars of their experience that bespeak volumes about them. I like subtlety, understatement, themes that percolate below the surface nearly unnoticed, multiple strands that seem to effortlessly come together to deliver a powerful and satisfying punch.

The wonderful political series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borgen/dp/B00FC5DGRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borgen</a>, from Denmark, powerfully demonstrated the dynamic, symbiotic relationship between reporters and politicians.  ANNIKA does the same for the press and the police, who often pursue the same leads in tandem but with different emphases and ends.  It reminded me quite a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lou-Grant/dp/6302747031/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lou Grant</a>, though far more sophisticated and painted with finer brushstrokes.  (Another thing I liked about Lou Grant, also evinced by Scandinavian shows in general, is the natural appearance of actors- people of all ages who look like REAL people.)

As an aside, at least one reviewer opined that not enough was shown of the forensic side of things.  I don't mind in the least the omission of the more gratuitous aspects of crime scene forensics evinced by so MANY American shows, e.g., maggots bursting out of victims' eyeballs, etc.  And in the real world, investigators (being human and fallible) more often than not go for the easy, obvious, and most likely, as in Episode 5, Lifeline, in which the jealous, abused wife is assumed to have killed her husband.  Real cases abound of people convicted on the basis of mostly circumstantial evidence (often largely because they're unlikable), sometimes even COUNTER to what forensics suggest, with other, more baffling and abstruse possibilities left dangling, as demonstrated by the Scott Peterson, Cameron Todd Willingham, Jeffrey MacDonald and Mary Surratt cases (of MANY).  ANNIKA exploits these troubling, grey areas to dramatic perfection.

The acting here is superb, the chain of events so realistic and utterly natural you forget you're watching a TV show (great camera work too).  And no gore, no gratuitous elements added merely for dramatic effect/shock value, nothing is there that shouldn't be, that doesn't drive the plot forward.  Annika is imperfect, makes mistakes; she's impulsive at times, ambitious- often steaming ahead when she's less than sure of herself, loathe to admit self-doubts, fears or vulnerabilities.  The show has empathy for all its characters, and for the tragedy that lurks at the heart of crime, yet is utterly matter of fact about both.  A fast-paced, riveting, intelligent series- a pleasure to watch.",1414195200,,3292,6.090909090909091
8592366,5,B00DDUF4G4,"I'm so hooked on this Swedish series. Malin Crepin plays the haunted crime reporter with just the right amount of pluck and compassion. Can't wait for the next installment. In the meantime, I'm reading the Liza Marlund books.

Update:
Many characters solve mysteries, but reporter protagonists can make their own headlines. One Ive come across lately is Swedish writer Liza Marklund who created Annika Bengtzon. Bengtzon works for the Stockholm publication Kvllspressen where she covers the crime beat.

Bengtzon, who is haunted by her past, is only comfortable as she unremittingly pursues her assignments, often risking her own life to get the story. At home where she is the mother of two young children and the wife of an impatient husband, she is much less confident. It is this juxtaposition that makes this series so interesting. She obviously loves her children, but doesnt seem quite sure how to fulfill two full-time jobs; that of parent and reporter. Annika cant seem to please her husband regardless. Her job is just too consuming for him.

At work, although the editor in chief Anders Schyman can be gruff, Annika is in her element. The work, however grim, nourishes her fragile ego. The reasons for this unfold as the series continues. But her pursuit of a story is engrossing. There is another question around every bend in the plot and questions are the best tool of a reporter. Unfortunately, sometimes the answers are dangerous, even deadly.

Liza Marklund is a journalist turned author and goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. Her books have been translated into some 30 languages. It is reported that ABC-TV in the States will debut a series based on her novels starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead of A Good Day to Die Hard. But until then check out the excellent movies starring Malin Crpin as Annika. They are available at Amazon, in Swedish with English subtitles.

Marklund is a deft writer who tells a taut entertaining story with believable characters. She divides her time between Stockholm and Marbella, Spain. The first book in the series is Studio 69 (Studio Sex in the US).",1400112000,3,2096,4.977142857142857
8592367,4,B00DDUF4G4,I really liked these shows and the setting of a newspaper office and getting to see what she went through to get her story.,1398124800,,123,4.166666666666667
8592368,4,B00DDUF4G4,"34 years old at the time this series was made, in 2012, rising Swedish star Malin Crepin embodies driven, young, thrill-seeking newspaper reporter Annika Bengtzon. While the title of the show as well as its premise suggest a throw back to 1940s film noir when most protagonists were usually either private eyes or reporters, the series is beautifully shot, stylish, and makes great use of colour and locations. While not without cliches, the scripts are exciting and we come to really care about Annika. This is crucial and not a given, for any protagonist, especially female, who sacrifices her home life for professional success (and perhaps to feed her addiction to adrenaline) is bound to come under some criticism for her choices, even in this day and age. It helps that Ms Crepin is beautiful without being intimidatingly so (making her likeable) but it is also a credit to her acting abilities that she so ably pulls this off.

The series gets off to a heart-pounding start when Annika finds herself at the annual Nobel Prize Banquet, Nobels Last Will, where she witnesses a shocking murder. But who is the real victim? Its the story of a lifetime but a gag order prevents her from writing about it. One of the shows ongoing cliches is established early in this episode when Annika appears to be in a very privileged position with the local police, who supply her with important crime-related information at the drop of a hat. Ultimately such details compromise the shows integrity and prevent it from being exceptional. ANNIKA BENGTZON is, however, still highly watchable and ones enjoyment level may be influenced by how forgiving one is towards these dramatic cliches.

Annikas home life is also somewhat predictable, with her husband a bit of a wet blanket the way he fails to put his foot down over Annikas extremely-driven behaviour, especially when it comes to her sharing the load of raising their two children. Speaking of which, how on earth would such a career woman take the time to have TWO children, let alone one. It is hard to imagine Annika Bengtzon taking maternity leave.

This is not to say anyone cant have a successful career and a happy home life, but it isn't easy, and perhaps the show could be a bit more creative when exploring this story arc.

Having said that, ANNIKA BENGTZON is an enjoyable set of six thrillers with a refreshingly different point of view, that of the committed journalist who relishes the challenge of rooting out the Big Story, but who also values the journalistic integrity in reporting the news fairly and accurately to the public.

The second episode, Prime Time, has an Agatha Christie feel to it, as Annika attempts to uncover who, out of ten possible suspects, is the killer of a famous TV host.

Episode three, Studio Sex, is a real pulse-racer and goes a long way into deepening our understanding of Annikas character.

These first three mysteries are packaged as one three disc box set.

The second box set continues Annikas pursuit of journalistic distinction. The three episodes are The Red Wolf; Lifetime; and A Place in the Sun. The last is the most interesting as Annika travels to Costa del Sol, Spain, to cover a story involving a murdered Swedish family. The change of locale is welcome. It should be mentioned that ANNIKA BENGTZON is based on the series of best-selling crime novels by Liza Marklund.

Perhaps it is unfair to compare a relatively straight-forward crime show like ANNIKA BENGTZON with BORGEN, from neighbouring Denmark, but with the latter outstanding show still fresh in this reviewers mind, it is inevitable. After all, Swedish and Danish sound the same to meand will to most North Americans. A subtitle is a subtitle. Still, if you enjoy crime thrillers, watching a beautiful young blonde Swedish woman try to solve the crime is not an unpleasant way to spend ones viewing time.",1397433600,,3872,4.8545454545454545
