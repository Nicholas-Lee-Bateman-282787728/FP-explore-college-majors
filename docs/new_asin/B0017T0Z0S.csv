8267164,1,B0017T0Z0S,"I'm not an Omid Djalili fan. The first time I saw him, he used a heavy accent and billed himself as the only comedian from Iran...and went on to make a lame British joke about that being about three more than Germany. I found it odd that someone who was supposedly from Iran would have the English hatred of Germans, and then he proceeded to give up the accent. Okay, so he is English...but as I discovered later, it doesn't just end there. He is always selling himself as Iranian, but really, he's only half, and not even muslim to boot (Bahai). Yet he's always on talkshows talking like he's an expert on all things muslim and middle eastern. If he were at least funny, but he trades in stereotypes, and since it's from an identity that isn't even his, it's grating. Why can't he be honest, and talk about being the English kid with the funny name? A lot of people from multi-cultural backgrounds could identify with him then, instead of being turned off by his two dimensional shouting and ululating.",1380585600,,1003,4.516483516483516
8267165,4,B0017T0Z0S,"Any guy who can bill himself as the ""only comedian from Iran"" has to have a solid act to follow that line.  I wasn't disappointed but a few slow spots made an otherwise funny guy a little dry.  I chalk that up to his British influences.  ;-p",1374969600,,241,4.085106382978723
8267166,5,B0017T0Z0S,"Omid is hilarious in stand-up, very good in movie bit parts, but this is excellent though feels too short by the time it is done.  If you're a real cheap skate, then you can find most of the material here and there on you tubes. This dvd is put together well, looks good and is funny even if  you've seen the on-line material.",1324166400,,326,4.158730158730159
8267167,5,B0017T0Z0S,His comedy is very targeted to those of middle eastern heritage or appreciation.  Very very funny stand up comedy.,1242777600,,114,5.0
8267168,3,B0017T0Z0S,"While I enjoy watching Omid Djalili and find his routines very funny at times, as this performance was taped in the UK, there are many references to British politics, etc., that I completely missed.  Definite buy for someone who has lived in Britain, but perhaps not for someone who can't follow the nuances of the performance.",1236038400,,327,4.839285714285714
8267169,5,B0017T0Z0S,I find Omid to be one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen.  This video is a collection of a lot of his classic routines,1221523200,,126,3.8461538461538463
