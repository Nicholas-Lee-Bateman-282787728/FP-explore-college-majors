3495946,5,B001BN4WK4,This is such great news! I have been waiting for this release for years. I can not wait for October 14th so I can finally buy this!!!,1214784000,3,133,3.962962962962963
3495947,5,B001BN4WK4,"The official DVD release is here, finally!!! After years of patience, waiting diligently for good news, any news, concerning 'Nash Bridges' release on DVD, we can all rest assured that we will have a copy of the first season come October 14th of this year!

First of all, let me just say that 'Nash Bridges' is one of the best police drama series of all time, if not the greatest. What made it great was its ability to fuse action, drama, comedy and heartfelt emotion together into one cohesive package that brought a wonderful hour of entertainment each week to millions of fans. I'm sure most of us NB fans are still scratching our heads over why this show was cancelled after six wonderful seasons, because quite frankly there wasn't anything near as entertaining on TV at the time, nor has there been since, with a few exceptions. It was very unfortunate that we did not get a season finale, let a lone a series finale, as it stands the last episode was sudden and without warning, with many plot threads left unresolved which will be left up to our imagination, but there is a bright side to this magnificient series' untimely demise, which is that the wait until we can see it again from the beginning on our DVD players is just a few months away:) Here's to Nash and Joe, one of the best cop teams ever, long live 'Nash Bridges'!",1214524800,48,1336,4.497942386831276
3495948,5,B001BN4WK4,I can't even believe now that as a Don Johnson/Miami Vice 'fan/fanatic' I'd never seen Nash Bridges!

3495960,5,B001BN4WK4,"I enjoyed watching the Original First Season as much as I did when it first aired on TV.  It left me looking forward to the next episode.
All the actors cast, fit their characters perfectly and brought that little extra to their parts.  The only negative comment I can make is that containing only 2 discs, that was really a half a season and not worthy of a full season price. On the whole, I'm glad I purchased it for my collection.",1393632000,,434,4.280487804878049

3495967,5,B001BN4WK4,Too bad shows like Nash Bridges no longer exist. Don Johnson and Cheech Marin make this show work. Down to earth characters and light hearted humor make this first season worth watching again and again. I look forward to watching season 2.,1381536000,,239,4.714285714285714
3495972,5,B001BN4WK4,I enjoyed this series very much in it's first run and i have enjoyed it very much seeing it again. The mixture of action and comedy come off very nicely and are very enjoyable. i will be purchasing the rest of the series.,1380931200,,221,4.162790697674419

Such a great charismatic crew they had with such amazing chemistry! It was definitely worth every penny that I spent to purchase the first season. i love the series. i am however disappointed with the fact that they still have not release seasons 4-6 yet. i would love to own the entire series. don johnson is so handsome and does a fabulous job as nash.",1380067200,,517,4.232323232323233

3495976,5,B001BN4WK4,Don Johnson is very good in this series. He does a lot of things right and many things wrong. He should get with Jethro on NCIS.,1374451200,,128,3.9615384615384617

3495978,5,B001BN4WK4,"Hard to come by in Norway ;-)

Don Johnson is awesome and cool.

Funny costumes as well.

Interesting to see a sweet side of Jodi Lyn O'Keefe rather than the evil one she portrays in Prison Break ",1370822400,,196,4.216216216216216
3495979,5,B001BN4WK4,"I was very disappointed when this show was cancelled on TV. I never missed the new ones, and even watched the re-runs on WGN when they were on. Even tho the supporting cast kept changing, I would assume a real police force is like that, and the new people kept it fresh while the core cast kept it going. Another show I going to keep buying.",1366156800,,341,4.181818181818182
3495980,5,B001BN4WK4,I loved this show. Im trying to watch from the beginning. This was always so funny. I loved how quick it got here,1363737600,,113,3.9565217391304346

3495983,5,B001BN4WK4,"This came in good time but, I was worried when I first received this because the case was battered a bit. However, all my worries vanished as I was able to play the whole season with no problem! This is such a good show, I'm glad I was able to purchase it.",1356220800,,256,3.9423076923076925

3495987,5,B001BN4WK4,"Super huge Don Johnson fan!! As Nash Bridges he is simply Amazing! Teamed up with Cheech Marin, the duo will keep you laughing while they catch the bad guys! Definatly a must have collection if your a Don Johnson fan.",1350000000,,217,4.45

3495989,4,B001BN4WK4,"Good series, but some of the scenery was a bit shabby. Not much genuine studio work, a lot of location inside & out shooting. Good drama for the time, had a major fan club following. Would recommend for fans of Don Johnson & other stars. Still searching for my elder brother, who appears in ""long shots"" as he was strictly speaking part of the production team.",1348617600,,360,4.46969696969697

seasons of Seinfeld as well.",1336521600,,149,4.555555555555555
3495991,5,B001BN4WK4,"one of my favorite shows.  I loved it.  I hated when it was cancelled, but now can watch it any time I want.",1333929600,,108,3.652173913043478
3496002,1,B001BN4WK4,"Both discs are damaged, possibly during the actual manufacturing or burning of the discs. There are large swirl-type patterns around the read faces of both discs that will not polish out with a micro fiber cloth. Therefore, parts of some of the episodes freeze up, and the discs skip to the next undamaged chapter, which is usually multiple chapters. Amazon does not replace these discs and they won't exchange the season for another title, because they are opened. I may try a buffing wheel, but I'm not sure it will help, as the marks don't appear to be scratches, but a defect in the discs themselves. I also bought Season 2 and 3 which are not damaged and play without incident.",1330387200,,682,4.644628099173554
3496003,5,B001BN4WK4,"Wow..a decent TV show that actually made it onto DVD! I remember watching this to see if Johnson could pull off another great tv detective after the iconic Sonny Crockett..and he did.. with a 70's muscle car and a unique partner. The season I will absolutely buy (can't afford every season of my fave tv shows anymore) was the one EPIC guest-star episode of Phillip Michael Thomas and Tommy Chong, teaming up yet again with their co-stars! I remember one scene when Don goes over to where Phillip has his back to the camera..and when he turns around..there's a little ""Vice rat-a-tat-tat"" music. I don't recall the storyline, but I remember Cheech and Chong worked one angle, and Crockett and Tubbs(sorry, couldn't resist)another. The other sequence I remember is  some kinda boat race/pursuit that ended badly (for the bad guys) and Don says to Philip: ""C'mon, let's get outta here."" A quality Vice moment! Anyway, the little car companies(can't remember who) came out with Nash's car..I looked and looked and never found it. I also think it's a great shout-out when we see NCIS's Gibbs sr. give jr. the same car..totally restored. I hope the rest of Nash Bridges gets released.",1322956800,,1179,4.865671641791045
3496004,3,B001BN4WK4,"I waited years for this to come out. Disappointed that half of the product is stuffed with advertising for other TV show DVD sets -- a waste of space. But at least I have the first Nash Bridges and will keep buying the follow up sets. I love this series. Will put up with the gross advertisements to get to the real thing at the next layer.

Do wish it arrived in better condition though. The shipping box was too big and the product was thrashed around inside. It arrived with a crushed cover and all the internal DVD disks flopping loose. But, I tested them and they played. So I guess that's all that matters. But would appreciate more careful shipping next time.",1312761600,,666,4.370967741935484
3496005,4,B001BN4WK4,"Great TV show, glad to see it on amazon. Corretion to the review by Amazon the Car is a 1971(not 1970) Cuda. Please fix your review.",1310601600,,132,4.115384615384615
3496006,4,B001BN4WK4,"I never saw the pilot episode until now and I thought it was a little slow.  I was wondering if maybe this show wasn't as entertaining as I remembered and waited a few weeks to watch the next episode.  After that, I was hooked all over again! This show has it all ... great location, costuming and of course, the Baracuda.  But the best thing about the show is the characters and their relationships with each other.  The show does not feel at all dated (except for the big cell phones!) and in fact, another favorite TV character of mine, Mark Harmon's Leroy Jethro Gibbs seems to have an awful lot in common with Nash.  Can't wait to get Season #2!",1283385600,,650,4.338842975206612
3496007,4,B001BN4WK4,"I had read several poor reviews on other sites re: Nash Bridges DVD's and was somewhat skeptical.  Apparently they are all produced overseas, as I suppose most everything is.  However, the ""First Season"" is fine, and I have since ordered and received the ""Second Season"".  Some of the sound is of poor quality, but it is very short lived.  May not be original music, but I don't watch DVD's to listen to background music.  Will continue to purchase from Amazon.",1250640000,3,461,4.7125
3496008,5,B001BN4WK4,I purchased this as a birthday to my fiance who looks like Don Johnson and has always had hot cars from the 60's on!,1245974400,,116,3.875
3496009,5,B001BN4WK4,"Finally this wonderful tv series arrived in dvd! I was so affectionate to the series and to the characters that almost 2 years ago I trusted a fake website who stolen me almost two hundred dollars for the complete series ...... but I wanted the series so much that I trusted them!!! Too bad for me! Now, finally, the series I most like is out on dvd, I can't tell you enough thanks for that and can't wait to purchase the complete series. WOW",1240704000,2,442,4.273809523809524

3496011,5,B001BN4WK4,"Had forgotten how much I enjoyed this series.  Well written, well acted - with drama and humor.  Can't wait to get the 2nd season.  A terrific program.",1235865600,,151,4.518518518518518
3496022,5,B001BN4WK4,I was and still am a huge Miami Vice fan. Although Nash Bridges is very different it didn't take but about 2 episodes to get used to Don playing a different character. It is a great series and I can't wait to recieve season 2. Nash Bridges is a little more humorous and more family oriented than Miami Vice. But it is cool!,1234915200,,323,4.142857142857143
3496023,5,B001BN4WK4,"It is really great to see season one since we hadn't started watching til my hubby heard the Cuda and said, turn back the station- so we were loyal watches from then on. Looking forward to the release of season two in March!!  We were not too happy when the series ended. We sure do miss it.",1232323200,,291,4.105263157894737
3496024,3,B001BN4WK4,"My son had asked for this for a Christmas gift.  He is 40 years old and loves Nash Bridges.  However, he said the full first series was not included and was disappointed in the DVD.  Doesn't deter me, I will get him the second series that comes out on Mar 3 to see if that is any better.",1231718400,,287,3.913793103448276

3496029,5,B001BN4WK4,"It has been a long time waiting but was worth the wait.  I honestly didn't notice that the music was not the original.  My memory is not what it used to be, buy I did remember what a great and fun show this was.  I have waited a long time for NB to come to DVD.  Now I just have to wait for the next season to come out.  Still one of the best shows ever on TV",1226102400,,359,3.551282051282051

3496032,5,B001BN4WK4,"I have been waiting for the Season 1 release of Nash Bridges for a long time, and I am grateful to CBS for the release.  Though Season 1 is only eight episodes, the price for the dvd set is worth every penny.  Don Johnson is an excellent actor; funny, serious, witty, emotional, and stylish.  He was great in Miami Vice, Nash Bridges and Just Legal and I think he is great in every role he plays. The San Francisco locations used in Nash Bridges are awesome too and the camera shots of the yellow convertible 'Cuda driving around Frisco are awesome. You feel like you are flying around the 'Cuda listening to Nash (Don Johnson) talk and drive at the same time. Cheech Marin, Jeff Perry and Harvey Leek are great in Nash Bridges too. Hope to see you in more t.v. and films Don, and thanks for your style of entertainment, both directing and acting. My only wish is to see Nash Bridges filmed in widescreen. Although it still looks awesome on a 50"" Plasma. Note to CBS, please release every season of Nash Bridges on DVD. Thanks from all Nash Bridges fans.",1225065600,,1054,4.422680412371134
3496033,3,B001BN4WK4,"Finally, Nash makes it to DVD. The series was so well written, cast, and produced. The Nash character is fun and quirky. The rest of the cast works well and writing is top notch. You get to see a lot of S.F. in scenes. Audio and video is not sweetened or trashed as is done so often on the small screen. Syndication, however, is another animal. USA net cut it up bad enough, WGN went even further and hacked it to shreds. Yuck!

Why we hate syndication in the first place. Naturally, the thought of enjoying the series in its original form was hopeful. Too bad that's not what we got. Some scenes were still edited from their original airing and choppy. The biggest disappointment was replacing all the music scores. It's blatantly obvious in the episode ""Vanishing Act"" where James Brown music was replaced with some kind of hip hop background poorly dubbed in. Scenes were re edited poorly and jumpy. You might as well watch the syndicated shows. They're free. It's subtly evident in the pilot episode where two Neal Hefti charts were replaced with some kind of weird pseudo jazz music. The scene was where Nash meets Kelly in the bar to discuss their final married moments. Dialog doesn't change but the weird background music is a let down. Totally changes the mood and scene establishment. Doesn't ruin the show but degrades it considerably. If you don't care about those things, you will like the DVD release. The music redux is annoying and the chopping certainly doesn't help. Just don't expect what you originally viewed. It's not there.",1224374400,16,1546,4.704797047970479
3496034,4,B001BN4WK4,"$28 (discounted) for 8 one-hour episodes is rather ridiculously overpriced.  Obviously the producers were counting on unprecedented demand.  The subject material is as good as it gets, IMHO...",1224374400,2,192,5.821428571428571
3496035,4,B001BN4WK4,"Nash Bridges is an amazing show. I remember watching this show when I was younger. It's action-packed and funny. The only down-side is the price. The price is pretty high for only 8 episodes. Since Nash Bridges first aired 3/26/96, the first season doesn't contain the usual 20+ episodes. However, if the price doesn't bother you, GO FOR IT! Nash Bridges is amazing and if you are a huge fan, you will not regret it.",1224028800,,416,4.56
3496036,2,B001BN4WK4,"This was probably the release I have most waited for as of yet. A fantastic show finally out on DVD, however, the DVD does NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL MUSIC. CBS must not have secured the lisences to use ANY of the original music featured on the show. After watching the pilot episode, ""Big Me"" by the Foo Fighters and ""Please Call Home"" by the Allman Brothers have both been replaced by instrumental overdubs of different music. This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I for one am incredibly disappointed that the DVD's do not contain any of the music featured in the show. Hopefully, from now on, CBS will obtain the lisences to use the rest of the music featured in the other five seasons.",1223942400,40,700,4.434108527131783
3496037,5,B001BN4WK4,"I am so excited that Nash Bridges is to be finally released on DVD.  I hope we get the original music. I became hooked on Nash before I became a DJ fan. It was the beautiful photography, location, characters and stories that I fell in love with. I don't have the DVD set yet but I do have several original episodes I taped from tv, plus I used to watch the USA versions and am currently watching the WGN versions. Of course I loved Nash (DJ) and Joe (Cheech) and their partnerships, but I also enjoyed Evan (Jamie Gomez) and Harvy (Jeff Perry) and their partnership. I liked seeing Nash's relationships with his family: daughter Cassidy (played by Jodi Lyn Okeefe)Lisa his ex-wife and mother of Cassidy (played wonderfully by Anette O'Toole) and of course Nash's Dad Nick (played by James Gammon,who also played DJ's Dad in a little made for tv movie Long Hot Summer) I loved that the locations were in this rotunda area, and also in later years it was moved to the Eureka and then finally the Barge. This series had a mixture of drama, comedy, and sometimes even tackled hard subjects like taking care of an older parent. Raising a daughter together with your ex-wife, juggling career with family. We also get to see in the first season AJ ""Nash's Lt. and Brynn Carson played by Mary Mara. Also Rick Betina is in several episodes (played by Daniel Roebuck.) I too was saddened by the cancellation of Nash but I heard the reason was CBS wanted a less expensive budget for Nash but DJ and the producers didn't want to cut the quality to do it. ""Fare Game"" The last episode served as a good series finale so at least we weren't left hanging too much. It was actually Nash that made me a fan of Miami Vice, but I hold Nash and MV in equal regard for different reasons.",1222905600,,1765,4.430769230769231

3496039,5,B001BN4WK4,"All I can say is ""it's about time!"" My family and I have been waiting for this show to come out on DVD ever since it went off the air. Where else can you find the charisma of Don Johnson and the coolness of Cheech Marin? I've always been a huge Don Johnson fan - from the days of Miami Vice (yes, I have all those DVD's!) to Nash Bridges - and all the movies in between. Nash Bridges was an entertaining show, unlike most of the shows from the last few years. It's a classic and I can't wait until October!",1220140800,,506,3.9705882352941178
3496040,5,B001BN4WK4,"First off, I am so glad that Nash Bridges is FINALLY available from Amazon on DVD.

As the review title says, though, people should be on the lookout for bootleg ripoffs on other sites. My father recently bought all 122 episodes on DVD from another website for about $115, including shipping. Great, right? Well, it turns out that every episode was recorded straight from TV, then burned onto DVD.

Everyone is definitely better off buying from a major vendor like Amazon.",1217289600,5,472,4.814814814814815

A big kudos to each and everyone who had a hand in getting us this DVD set, and you betcha that I'll not only buy that one in a hurry, but all other seasons, too. (read: please give us the other seasons, too *hint* *hint* :o)

Can't wait for October...Christmas is comin' early this year! *g*

Keep 'em comin' Bubba,

3496043,5,B001BN4WK4,"So incredibly excited that this show is FINALLY going to be on DVD!! I am addicted to catching the episodes on WGN in syndication.  Hope they keep seasons 2-6 coming out right behind it.  I agree with the other posters, the best crime drama, so full of entertainment.  My hat is off to casting, there is not a weak actor/actress in the bunch.  And Don has not received near the credit he deserves as an actor.  He can communicate so well without any dialogue.  His facial expressions, his eyes, they say it all.
October can't come soon enough!!!",1216684800,,545,4.510204081632653
3496044,5,B001BN4WK4,"I must say that when this show first came out, I was indifferent. I remember when they advertised the show and I thought how odd a couple that was, Don Johnson and Cheech Marin. I was never a Cheech fan and didn't know what to expect from him in a cop drama. Like most TV shows I've come to enjoy, I didn't start watching this one until it was in re-runs. I have to say, I found it immensely enjoyable. Cheech showed he has some range, going from the 70's ""Dave's not here"" to a very likable (and grown up) Joe Dominguez. Don Johnson seems to be a very talented actor, in his own words comparing himself to De Niro and Pacino:""I've got the talent, they've got the material."" If you have the resources, catch him on his little known next series, ""Just Legal"" which only ran for 8 episodes before they regrettably pulled the plug. Nash also had a very good supporting cast as well, and very good semi-regulars like Boz Bishop, Jake Cage, Pepe, and Rick Bettina to name a few. It's a very tasty mix that's light on your palette, unlike many other darker cop shows out there. There's action, romance, drama, comedy...what more could you ask for! The first season is short (only 8 episodes). Fortunately, there have been reports of extras to be included with the set, such as a round table discussion between the shows writers. And Cheech Marin has reportedly said that he was interviewed for the Dvd release! All in all, a very good show; highly recommended!!!",1216598400,,1456,4.49811320754717
3496045,5,B001BN4WK4,"Thanks Amazon.com, the writers, producers and actors for FINALLY bringing NB to DVD.  This has been such a long time in the making and we are VERY happy to finally be able to watch every episode.  This was one of the greatest crime dramas on TV.  The viewers were angry, shocked and saddened to learn that CBS would not renew it. We were definitely CHEATED!  The relationship Nash and Joe had inside & outside the office was terrific.  To get drama, comedy and emotion all in one episode week after week is very artistic and truly amazing.  I cannot wait to add to the NB collection with the remaining seasons.  I hope we don't have to wait as long!",1215993600,,649,4.4033613445378155
3496046,5,B001BN4WK4,"Nash Bridges finaly arrives. Nash Bridges is one of the best police/detective drama series of all time. A show that i never get tiered of watching. I cant say much about the DVD and it quality or extras but i can tell u that this is one of the best showes ever and totaly had to be included into everyones collection.
I only saw the german version on TV and cant wait till they release it on DVD. So my advice, go and get, its totaly worth it.",1215648000,,443,4.045454545454546
3496047,4,B001BN4WK4,"Nash Bridges was very popular on TV in the late 1990's. It was widely considered as a good show, and it had plenty of viewers. I know that a lot of people also taped it if they weren't home a Friday night.
Still it never really was on re-run on TV. Or I am wrong? And not until now it is released on DVD - not moment too soon!
I must say that despite this cop-show's quality it became forgotten among the average person and the TV-channels. I don't know why.
It is very 1990's in a way. Maybe thats the reason. But this fact makes it even more interesting to watch now.
They mixed suspensful drama, fast action, cool details and cool atmosphere, with humour and - maybe mos important - charachters you got a liking for, very human! When it comes to nitty gritty (does one say so? It's your language, I'm just trying to use it!) there is a special bond between the charachters. Especialy between Nash and Joe, and between Nash and his father - I love that relation they had. It was sometimes very touching, I am not kidding.

I must add that the series actually gets better with the years. Maybe becasuse you then know the characjters and consider them almost family. This first season is good - no question about it - but I find season two even better. So I will wait with the 5 stars until later. But it is a solid four star. Season two and on are solid fives...

Don Johnson is a super actor. I never understood why he never was in more big screen movies. That is a mystery. I find him as good as any of the big ones. Despite that he will never be forgotten. I mean HE PERSONALLY chnged or set the trend for a whole world of men's fashion with his role in Miami Vice.
Don's role as Nash Bridges is different from Sonny Crockett in Vice. So don't think that they are alike, because they're not. Which is good!

I have written way too much already. Enjoy Nash Bridges on DVD, and look forward to the release of season two!",1215302400,6,1922,4.217391304347826

3496050,5,B001BN4WK4,"It's finally here! I have been waiting on this for so long , that its actual release comes as a shock. One thing's for certain, this show is one of the best, if not THE best crime drama ever made. Yes, even better than Miami Vice, Don Johnson's breakout hit show of the 80's. Don Johnson is an incredible actor, and he is at his best on this show, no doubt about it. And Cheech Marin? What else is there to say except that he is funny as usual, but on this show there's something else about him too. With these characters, you actually get emotionally involved in their day to day jobs and lives. It's just a great show, and awesome supporting cast too. It's just unbelievable that it was canceled after 5 great seasons!",1214956800,19,720,4.301470588235294
