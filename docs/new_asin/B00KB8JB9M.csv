6413233,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Bar none.  This is a great film.  Tendency here would be to overshadow its storytelling and craftsmanship with the important message that it carries.  Even better, it is based upon the writer/ director's personal experience, so when it comes to making an investment of money and time in watching a film you have a home run with Return to Zero because you as the viewer are receiving the filmmaker's heart.  That takes courage.

The cast is first rate and they leave it all on the screen.  Bravo to the cinematography for giving us an inside look.  We are a part of the story and not marched through the Director of Photography's bag of tricks.  It is appropriately shot.  The viewer is voyeuristically welcomed into the story.  There are no cinematic distractions.  Presentation is paramount.  That lends to great direction.

No doubt this story will be hard to watch for anyone, especially for those who have suffered the experience of having a baby die.  That being said...this situation is due your respect, time and attention.  Our babies deserve as much.

You will laugh.  You most certainly will cry.  You will be entertained and you will be challenged.  Bravo to this film team.  My condolences to those who have walked this path.  10 stars for Return To Zero.",1400025600,64,1267,4.773148148148148
6413234,5,B00KB8JB9M,This movie without a doubt is amazingly done! Truly life changing for the loss community and anyone dealing with loss. Sean Hanish's ability to share his own tragedy with an astounding amount of grace & talent! A must watch!,1400025600,26,224,4.769230769230769
6413235,4,B00KB8JB9M,"I realize this movie addressed the pain and loss of the parents and how their loss impacted them and their relationship. But.... I've never seen a movie, nor read a book regarding Peri natal death that gives any time or weight to the grandparents' grief. So I'll tell my own story, briefly.
When the phone rang on Nov 6 around 6PM, I was elated. My daughter was 1 week over due and the call was from the Hospital, according to Caller ID.  As soon as she said ""Mom"", I knew. ""Zoey died.""
I won't go into details. What I will say, however, is that Grandparents have to deal with  their own sense of loss. Who knows of a grandmother who isn't over the moon excited about having her first grandbaby?  Our pain is VERY VERY real and on top of that loss, OUR baby is going through something incredibly painful and we can't fix it. There's no making it feel better, there's no comforting her, or him. There's nothing to do but sit by, day after day, month and ever year after year watching, helplessly. The grandparents in this film, including the maternal grandmother, seemed distant, almost to the point of being apathetic about losing their grandchild. If this is how it really occurred, I'm so very sorry for the young couple.  Zoey would have been 4 years old last November, and I will forever miss her. My hope is that I'll get to see her, rock her and sing lullabies to her in heaven.  Thankfully, we now have a beautiful, healthy, rambunctious 2 1/2 old boy. Our ""rainbow""baby. (And we just found out, another on the way).
Things NOT to say to grieving Mothers and Fathers; 1. ""It's better now than to have lost her a few weeks from now when you're REALLY attached."" (I'd happily die TODAY if in return my daughter could spend an hour with her lost baby girl) 2. ""You're young enough to have more"" (True, but one baby does not replace another) 3. ""You'll get over this, just don't dwell on it"". (No, you won't ""get over it"". You'll simply learn to incorporate this pain into your life"" and 4 (my favorite) ""Tell her not to talk about it, that just keeps the grief fresh"". (That's true. Talking about it is painful, thinking about her is painful, but the PAIN is all we have of her. We don't have first steps, giggles, dirty diapers, mid night feedings, stained shirts from spit up, first days of school, skinned knees, well.. you get the picture. ALL we have is the pain, which has somehow become a sweet pain.  I don't want it to stop, I don't think my daughter does either.
Finally, I want to say a word to Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. What we DO have are a collection of wonderful pictures of a beautiful baby girl. Their work is so skillful and sensitive, most people think the beautiful baby girl pictured on my mantel is simply ""sleeping"". Our photographer's name was Holly, and I will always love her. She gave us a priceless gift.
Sweet dreams baby Zoey, See you in heaven.  Love, Grandma.",1422662400,10,2936,4.415896487985212

6413248,5,B00KB8JB9M,"This is a beautifully heart wrenching film. Minnie Driver is at her absolute best. There are so many reasons to watch this movie, but the most important reason is that child loss affects countless people every single day. The director is incredibly brave to tell his family's personal story and was not afraid to show moments of brutal honesty. It's an emotional ride, but well worth it. There's a strength that one takes away at the end that I found very healing. I also highly recommend the book Three Minus One, which was inspired by Return to Zero. It's a collection of stories about child loss at various stages. I should say that I am one of the contributors to the book, but despite that, a certain fear gripped me upon receiving the book. After watching Sean's film though, I opened it up and began to read the stories. Beautiful is the word that comes to mind. Wonderful work by all involved.

6413251,5,B00KB8JB9M,"This movie is a big step in education in pregnancy loss. Hopefully it has educated many people. It was really difficult to watch as a father whom has encountered this kind of loss and my heart goes out to all those affected by pregnancy loss. The mothers mostly are affected by the loss obviously as they carry the child and first hand intimate closeness during developement.
The second comment I have is to all of the people whom come into contact directly or indirectly with someone whom has experienced loss. Please understand that people grieve these losses and respect their feelings and wishes. Just because the child is not physically here any more does not mean grieving will ever end. As you need to eat and breath so does the memory and grief for loss of life cling to the everyday fabric of grieving parents.
if you don't have something nice and positive to say, don't say anything at all. Not everyone will view everything the same as you.

Minnie Driver seems to be trying hard and over-acting but still misses the mark (I like her but this isn't her best work, in my opinion). Paul Adelstein (whom I loved in Private Practice) disappoints here.

This movie helped me realize that my life after losing my baby was 'normal' in the world of baby loss.  I am glad that this movie is helping to create an awareness that losing a baby is not something we need to keep quiet about.

6413283,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Parents are, and always will be, in a constant state of worry for their precious child. We know statistics and are aware of certain tragedies that may befall a family at any time. Because of this awareness, once our healthy children arrive home from the hospital we constantly worry about illness and accidents, calling the pediatrician at every cough, sneeze or bruise. We buckle seatbelts and strap on bike helmets and kneepads. We do everything we can to keep our children safe and healthy. However, no one ever expects anything to happen to a beautiful healthy child who is developing perfectly in the womb.

Stillbirth is unheard of and throws a family into severe shock and devastation. Doctors do not speak of it. It is a complete and utter shock when it happens... all too often. Return To Zero is a beautifully devastating account of one family's journey through stillbirth, however their journey was so similar to mine that it hurt. The movie depicts so many of the aftershocks a stillbirth brings about: shutting down and checking out, marital problems, inappropriate comments and hurtful family and friends, and subsequent children, just to name a few. Every minute of this movie touched on something important.

The more people who see this movie, the more the silence of stillbirth will be broken. It is important for our society to be aware of this issue so that families are not completely blindsided if their baby should tragically be born still, so that there is more appropriate support for grieving families, and so our society can demand more than the ""s***ty science"" (a quote from the movie) that our pregnant mothers are fed during their pregnancies.",1400544000,,1674,4.932624113475177

Overall, I cannot say it is a great movie because of the subject matter, but I give it 5 stars, not because I love it, but because I think everyone should watch it just once. I am really glad this movie was made, and even more glad that I watched it. This was a movie that my husband did not want to watch because he didn't really want to re-live our past through a movie. But he watched it with me reluctantly, and had very similar reactions to me. There were some parts of the movie that were dramatized (such as the affair Aaron had) which I felt was unnecessary. It risks telling people that a mistake done under duress is somehow more forgivable than under other circumstances. I know many people who have suffered losses and have not cheated on their significant other. Yes, it can put a strain on a relationship, but there is no excuse to have an affair. The other thing that bothered me was the conversation between Maggie and her mom in the movie about miscarriages, though I appreciate that her mom addressed it well. No, a miscarriage is not the same as a stillbirth; however the loss is no less painful or devastating. I think the dramatization of the story took away from the heart of the issue at hand, but I understand in order to have Lifetime pick it up it needed to have some plot twists. More movies like this need to be made to create awareness around this taboo subject. There are thousands of other stories out there.

It has opened the door to communicate and talk about what losing a child to stillbirth is like so that it no longer has to be something forbidden.  This movie was done is a way that honors our babies and tells the story of what happens to real people in the aftermath of grief.

6413286,5,B00KB8JB9M,"I was very nervous to watch this movie. I lost my 1 month old son 5 months ago, and then I lost another baby at 16 weeks, 2 weeks ago. I was worried, that they couldn't really touch the emotion, and events, that happen after pregnancy/infant loss. I was wrong. This movie shows how it really truly affects a family as a whole. It helps people understand what, as parents, we go through when go through such grief. Because I am still going through this grief, which is so raw, it physically hurts, I have hope. It make me feel so much better, that I don't have to pretend to be happy when im not, and not hide my hurt to comfort others. I truly thank everyone who was involved in making this movie, and spreading awareness. 5 stars for sure!",1400544000,2,740,4.25531914893617
6413287,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Thoughtful, real, and completely relatable movie about the horrors of pregnancy and infant loss and the fear in subsequent pregnancy.  The story is very well done and Minnie Driver is superb.",1400544000,,191,5.161290322580645
6413288,5,B00KB8JB9M,"As I watched the trailer for this film repeatedly on Facebook, I could not help crying.  Already from that short clip, I could tell I would be transported back to ""that dark time"" in my life.  The film did not disappoint.  I was comforted to see such an accurate portrayal of pregnancy loss and to know my community of baby-loss parents was watching along too.

I must commend Minnie Driver.  How she brought the depth of emotion to her character Maggie, without ever having experienced this herself, I will never understand.  But she understood.  Minnie ""got it"" where so many have failed.  Her expressions of emotion were so true to life.

I would recommend this film be watched by Ob/Gyns, Grief Counselors, Social Workers, Infertility Specialists and anyone with in interest in how to help a couple cope through this devastation.

6413294,5,B00KB8JB9M,"I may be a bit biased, as I lost an infant daughter 10 years ago when she was born 16 weeks too early. But in that time, I've come to know so many - too many - families who have lost babies, whether to miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death, and it's awful that there is still such a stigma attached to these losses in the year 2014.  I am so thankful to Sean Hanish and all of the cast, crew and  supporters of this movie for hopefully opening some eyes and hearts.

6413296,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Being part of the Hope Moms organization, I was immediately drawn to RTZ. Its an open and honest portrayal of the complicated, often messy journey of grief accompanying infant loss.  I have not experienced stillbirth, only early miscarriages, but that did not hinder my ability to relate. I know some were put off by the scene addressing miscarriage, but I believe it was a realistic reflection of what many mothers feel; a sense of some kind of hierarchy of grief. The loss of a child at any stage is devastating on so many levels that they simply cannot be compared. I appreciate that Minnie and Paul's characters grieved differently and often solo; so many of us and our significant others have done the same.  I hope that RTZ can be the catalyst for change that is so desperately needed not just within hospitals but in our own homes and social circles as well.",1400457600,,865,4.647058823529412

It was hard to watch at times as it brought up some bad memories but I think this movie will definitely help anyone that has experienced the loss of a stillborn child.",1400457600,,425,4.132530120481928

I am grateful beyond measure for the sincerity & talent that went into this movie, from the bottom of my heart I thank them for writing it.

6413300,5,B00KB8JB9M,"I waited a long time for this movie to be released and it was perfect in every way!  Unlike most true stories, return to zero is real. The movie is so authentic you can see your own experience in every aspect! I lost my baby at 23 weeks, just a week shy of being ""medically"" termed a stillbirth and yet much of what Minnie Driver portrays applied to my own personal tragedy. I would recommend this movie to anyone who falls into the 'pregnancy/infant loss' group regardless of what stage of pregnancy you were in because your loss is tragic and you deserve to be validated.  You are not alone and should never feel like you are. Most importantly, I would recommend this to every single person who has never experienced a loss.  It's very likely you will know some one, at some point, that will lose a baby and they will need your support. This movie is incredible at teaching you what not to do or say! There were so many parts of this movie that grabbed me but my favourite moment is expressed in this quote ""it's not just the loss of a baby, it's the loss of the possibility of what could have been'"". Sure it's a tough movie to watch,  but it is far more important than the discomfort you may feel.",1400457600,2,1201,4.300884955752212

If you ever wondered or ""couldn't imagine"" what a loss such as a stillbirth is like, watch this film! Being a loss parent myself, I was truly impressed with how beautifully done the film was. Everything was spot on and there were so many moments in the film where I remembered thinking the same things or saying the same things or even experiencing the same moments. I think the film is especially important to the people who have not experienced a loss because it's a good window into what life is like for someone who has. Stillbirths are more common than you think and chances are you know someone or are related to someone who has had a stillbirth or other type of loss. A loss is a loss and each one is unique to that person and this film shows exactly that. I hope people take the time to watch this wonderful film.",1400457600,,925,4.3468208092485545

Minnie Driver was spot on perfect, as a mother who has lost an infant, her emotions portrayed everything perfectly. This was a raw movie but astoundingly moving. It helped heal me in ways I did not know I needed to be healed and actually helped me move through my grief in some small way.  So many things portrayed in this film were exactly the same things I went through and it was beyond validating to know I was not alone.

I commend Sean Hanish for having the strength to make this film - while it is healing to write and talk about out losses, I can't imagine the determination it took to put it all out there on film.

We now have two beautiful daughters.  You would think almost 10 years out from the loss of our son that we could sit through this movie without being activated however, it was not possible.  Tears streamed down our faces as we held one another through it all.  The only part of this movie that was disappointing was the husband cheating on the wife.

Only someone who has lost a child could tell this story...and Sean Hamish did it right. The movie brought back so many things I faced after losing my son....from the wrong things people say when trying to comfort you, to the stores refusing to let you return baby gifts that you so desperately just want out of your home, to that one person who didn't hear the news and asks how your baby is. The movie was raw, honest yet entertaining. And Minnie Driver was just plain phenomenal.

This film not only needed to be made, but it deserves to be seen!  While the subject matter is difficult, it is handled honestly, and with tenderness and wit along the way.  The scenery and landscape are captured brilliantly and beautifully, proving the filmmakers' artistic eye and attention to even the tiniest details.

My doctor helped me and my finace with just about everything. I wish this movie was out last year before Lee's heart stopped beating.

This movie is so much more than a child dying.  It is so much more than death.  It is about the beauty of life, the resiliency of the human spirit, it is about living when you are pretty certain that there is nothing left to live for.

This movie has offered our society an incredible gift by sharing such an intimate story with the world.  It is  breaking the silence of stillbirth, it is breaking the silence of the taboo subject that babies die, too.  By watching this movie, friends and family members can better understand and support those they love when they experience the unimaginable loss of their child. Because of this film, families whose babies have died will have support not only from the community who relates to them but also from friends and family who (through this film) can be more empathic, loving and patient as they rebuild their life. This movie is for everybody because unfortunately, at some point in your life, you will know someone who experiences a tragic loss and you will want to be able to support them.

Yes, this movie is about a family whose child has died.  Yes, this movie is about a child who left far too soon.  This movie is mostly about love, perseverance, and the ability to create life after loss..

Reading about the loss of Arthur and while I do not relate to the loss of a child, I related to the feeling of loss and the hope of what might have been.  My child was born prematurely and I watched our son fight for his life for 91 days.  He came home and while he is a thriving 4 year old, I still deal with the 'loss' of pregnancy and the joy of giving birth and taking that bundle of joy home from the hospital.  This film deals with raw emotion.  The feeling that your spouse does not recognize the pain you have endured but realizing that everyone grieves differently.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who has experience a loss.  The acting is impeccable and the film speaks volumes on a subject that is kept quite hidden as no one really likes to touch on the loss of a child.

Minny Driver and Paul Adelstein expertly convey the full range of emotions parents experience when a child is stillborn.  We connect with them, grieve with them and learn from their experience how much the sincere acknowledgement of their loss validates that child's life and the parents' love.

6413335,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Return to Zero is about a young couple whose son is stillborn and their battle with their grief and rebuilding their life and coming back together as a united force.  Minnie Driver and Paul Adelstein are phenomenal.  They portray the real emotions, the real raw physical and emotional pain that we parents of stillborn son and daughters experience everyday.  They address everything that happens, the guilt a woman feels about her uterus being a ""lethal weapon,"" the social isolation because no one knows what to say to you, the canyon that forms between the parents, the frustration of people not understanding the difference between a miscarriage and a stillbirth, and just people's lack of knowledge and acceptance that their son or daughter was really there, and really did exist.
If you have never experienced the soul shattering loss of a stillbirth, this movie is still good to watch because it teaches you what happens so frequently, and a glimpse into what the parents are going through; so you can better understand where they are coming from.  It will teach you what are the right things to say when you encounter someone whose baby has died.
Besides the context of the movie, it's still deserves 5 stars because it's educational without you realizing it.  It makes you think about what really goes on in the real world, and that is not every pregnancy ends in a perfect pink baby.  Yes, the message is very hard and it's a very sad movie (but there are also parts where you will laugh), but it's one of those movies that has the potential to change our society.  To shatter the glass walls that keep us contained and silent.  Most importantly, this movie is allowing us mothers of miscarriage, stillbirth and infant loss to speak out and not be forced to suffer in silence.",1400457600,2,1785,4.7540453074433655

Minnie Driver has captured this loss perfectly, I hope this movie is viewed and respected as a real portrayal, by people who haven't lost a child because it is society that needs to be made aware.  Sadly us parents who have had to bury children understand this, I hope it is viewed by a whole world of people who don't know this loss and want to understand it so they can support loved ones.  It happens more often than people realise, and it is time those little lives are acknowledged and made valid.  I have lost 4 children, all at varying stages from miscarriage to infant loss, I have no bring home and keep baby.  My only criticism is that a lot of the well meaning comments weren't challenged, and the subtlety might be missed by those who haven't experienced this kind of loss.  I have a wonderful circle of family and friends now who understand that this loss and grief is never ending, and complete happiness is a term I never use anymore.

I was gratefully and pleasantly surprised.
I think that different viewers will have different experiences with this movie.
For those of us who have experienced a stillbirth (particularly a near-term loss), the movie is a collection of so many small details and moments that no one should have to experience. There is a strange comfort in seeing others respond to the same situations we have found ourselves in.
For our friends and family who have experienced our loss, as well as a loss of their own with the death of our baby, it provides a window into our world--a world they have been trying to help us navigate, but without any kind of map to help them stumble across the terrain.
And for those who have never experienced babyloss, some of the scenes may seem over-the-top or surreal. It may not feel true, and it may seem overly dramatic. It opens the window into our world, but unless they are willing to accept that the experience can be this dramatic, and this heartbreaking, and this all encompassing, I suspect they will find the movie  lacking. So if you fall into this last group and have never experienced babyloss, I ask you to watch this film with and open mind, an open heart, and the assurance from many babyloss families that this movie IS real.",1400371200,6,1397,4.678861788617886

But, as a film, this was just so-so.  I love Minnie Driver and I thought she was fantastic, but the other characters, for the most part, seemed one-dimensional and sort of beyond redemption.  The story felt to me like a bunch of clichs strung together, like the writer took all of the most hurtful things that people say and do to families in grief, and then wrote the story around those.  It seemed inorganic at times because of this.  But, there were also moments of intense and raw beauty that took my breath away.  All in all though, it was a bit of a disappointment for me.

The toll that any reproductive trauma takes on a couple isn't well appreciated by those who have not had the experience and this illustrates some of that. It is a different kind of grief...its a loss of the future and possibilities...and its not just one loss, its a loss over and over again when milestones would have been experienced by a parent. This film does a wonderful job of expressing the depth of that experience.  I was a little surprised at the beginning that they did not show the parents spending time with their baby but that may have been too early in the story.  I think by the end of the film, people who were watching but who have not had this experience would have a better understanding of how sweet and important that time can be. Early in the show they may not have appreciated it as much. It did make me sad they only had an hour with him.

6413372,5,B00KB8JB9M,"FINALLY an honest, unflinching portrayal of perinatal bereavement. No Hollywood whitewashing through the hard bits, this was grief as it ACTUALLY happens.

As a childless mother who lost her only child 20 hours after he was born, I found RTZ  incredibly difficult to watch at times, but it was also very cathartic and oddly healing in a way I can't quite understand, let alone explain. I'd love everyone I know to watch it so they could really understand the person I am now and the true weight of the sorrow that I still carry 9 years later. The circumstances surrounding my son's death and our healing afterward were different, but the portrayal of that horrific, all-consuming grief--that was so, so real. I'm stunned by the performances and in awe of director Sean Hanish's ability to pull so much from his obviously talented cast.

What an incredibly important movie. They wanted to break the silence, and they are doing just that. ""Bravo"" is entirely too small a work, and ""thank you"" just isn't enough either.",1400371200,4,1016,4.827586206896552

We all know someone or of someone who has lost a child, not just through being stillborn, and this gives a glimpse of what a person goes through. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone.",1400371200,3,468,4.482352941176471
6413374,3,B00KB8JB9M,"The words ""based on a true story"" flashed across the screen at the beginning, and I thought, yes. Yes. Based on a lot of true stories. A lot of devastating, heartbreaking, horrible, endlessly sad true stories.

And then I'm falling. Remembering. Lost in the experience all over again. The fear, the knowing yet not knowing, the weight of the loss, so sudden and violent. It rips out your insides in one fell swoop.

No heartbeat.

No heartbeat.

Sorry, spoiler. The baby dies.

I sat through all two and a half hours of it and I don't think I stopped crying. Minnie Driver captured that empty, hollow feeling completely. They ask, ""Did the baby have a name?"" and I felt that hesitation--as if naming him made it final.

I am naming a dead child.

I know what that's like.

And Paul Adelstein does an amazing job as the father--burying himself in doing something, anything. That helpless, lost feeling of a man without a direction. His honest portrayal of loss is poignant and painful to watch.

But it is all very, very real.

I hope everyone watches this movie. Not because it's an amazing piece of cinematic genius. This is a Lifetime movie we're talking about. But it's raw, it's emotional, and it shows stillbirth like it really is, for the most part.

We're all different, of course. Not everyone handles things the same way. But we all remember the moments we have in common.

We all remember the moment we found out. The first time we saw our dead baby. The last time.

We all remember that person who said, ""Everything happens for a reason."" We all remember the worst, most unhelpful thing someone said to us, like my sister, who said, ""Dad got to hold the baby first up in heaven!"" Or the awful, ""Be grateful for the children you already have.""

We all remember when our milk came in to feed a baby that wouldn't ever need it. We all remember the first time we had to face a pregnant woman afterward. We all remember holding a living baby for the first time at some point after holding our dead one. We all remember pretending, putting on a happy face, sinking into depression in the meantime, drowning our sorrows in our nearest comfort of choice.

We all remember, because we can't forget.

The most beautiful thing about this movie is its honesty.

I know it isn't easy to face the horrible reality of infant loss, even from the outside, but for many, many families, it is a reality they can't escape. They live it every single day, with every breath, until they die. It doesn't go away. It's not something you move on or move past.

That's why I think Return to Zero is worth watching. Yes, there is (spoiler alert!) a rainbow after the storm. There is another baby. But that baby doesn't ever fill the hole in your heart. It doesn't change things. You're still the mother--or father--of a dead baby. Forever.

For baby loss mamas afraid to feel it all again--watch it anyway. It's beautiful. It's cleansing. It's like turning to that first mama you discovered had also experienced a loss, seeing the same look in her eyes, and knowing--she understood your pain. Finally, finally. Someone understands. It's that feeling, all over again. Being heard, being felt, being witnessed.

For people who have never experienced a loss like it and are afraid to think about it--watch it anyway. It will break open your heart, it will leave you raw but your perspective completely changed. You can't know the pain of that loss--but you can empathize, and that is your best gift to the walking wounded. I have been lucky enough to know women in my life who can do just that, who took time to understand, even if they couldn't imagine the unimaginable.

So thank you to Sean Hanish and his lovely wife, Kiley, for bringing their story to life for the rest of us. Your son, Norbert, was a gift to you, and now to all of us. The world. Thank you for sharing him. He will always be remembered.",1400371200,56,3889,4.566906474820144

I also liked the fact it was real, real feelings, honesty, and it showed during those harder times that it is ok to be mad and to work through all of the grieving process, even though you will never forget and you will always be that baby's mother/father you can eventually move on and be happy and have happy healthy children.

6413380,5,B00KB8JB9M,"As a three time survivor of pregnancy loss, I know all too well the pain and heartbreak that comes with losing a much anticipated pregnancy. Having to return maternity clothes and baby gifts, listening to the well meaning yet thoughtless comments and questions about what went wrong, dealing with the anxiety of a subsequent pregnancy...it's all a part of a silent sorrow that I and so many grieving parents have faced.
Sean Hanish has experienced such pain and courageously and brilliantly captured the many aspects of pregnancy loss with Return to Zero. The cast, headed by Minnie Driver and Paul Adelstein, is top notch and the entire production...cinematography, writing, direction...it's all first rate. As hard as it was for me to watch, I knew I had to watch it. Return to Zero gets to the heart of a very real, very painful subject but it is a subject that should not...that cannot...be suffered in silence any longer.

6413381,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Return to Zero is an amazing film. It was incredibly realistic, sugarcoating nothing and showing the real impact on mothers, fathers, and relationships after the loss of a baby. Minnie Driver's performance was superb. Her portrayal of a mother who has just lost her beloved baby is spot on--if I didn't know better, I would believe she had really been through it. I felt like I was watching a cast of characters from my own post-baby loss life -- the well-meaning ""everything happens for a reason"" relative, the ""God has a plan"" Bible thumpers, the friends who treat you as though you are contagious and walk away from you when you need them most. Losing a child changes you and your relationships forever. Return to Zero portrays that so accurately. I hope that those who see this movie who haven't lost a child will realize the normal span of emotions mothers and fathers go through and learn to open the dialogue and acknowledge our children's lives and deaths.",1400371200,,964,4.744047619047619

Did this movie take me back to the darkest place in my life yes, but as most parents who have lost a child can tell you, that dark place hides within us everyday....because in that darkness our sweet babies are the one bright shining light....and yet we're so often told to hide that light...to not share our grief, because it's too scary.

6413384,4,B00KB8JB9M,"RTZ does a good job of validating grief after pregnancy loss. It sensitively portrays the range of emotions after losing your baby -- denial something is wrong, disbelief at the diagnosis, the shock, the horror, the ghastliness of delivering a dead baby, the aftermath, the milk coming in, and the hurtful things well-meaning people say.

I am, at long last, pregnant again, and could identify with the loss of innocence and the fear of bonding with this baby after my miscarriage. The movie does a great job of exploring those fears too.

There weren't as many laughs as I has been led to believe by one blog post. It's definitely a tear-jerker. I'm not one to cry easily in a movie, but I sobbed in several places. Minnie Driver delivers a heart-wrenching performance.

RTZ is worth watching by anyone who has lost a baby, or their friends / family members who are trying to support them.  But it is absolutely filled with grief triggers--as any movie broaching this delicate subject matter ought to be.",1400371200,5,1005,4.758620689655173

6413395,5,B00KB8JB9M,"I've had one stillborn twin (with a surviving twin), as well as three ectopic pregnancies and three rainbow babies (three living children, four losses).  I am well acquainted with grief.  A good portion of Return to Zero is spot on with the ludicrous and insensitive things people say to a couple who have lost a baby.  The film also shows the different ways husbands and wives may grieve.  I don't want to give any spoilers and will try not to, however, there are some things that should be mentioned.  First, this is NOT a family movie!  There are a couple of sexual situations that are fairly raw.  It is also important to remember that this is just one couple's story among many, many, many stories.  There is no way that one couple's feelings and experiences are going to echo every couple's feelings and experiences.  Nor should they, because our stories are all unique.  This is not the perfect movie about pregnancy loss.  It is, however, the first movie that has tackled this subject head on and therefore should be held up and applauded.

Bottom line:  Return to Zero is worth watching.  There is much truth in it.  If you have experienced a pregnancy loss, you will relate to it on multiple levels.  And as those of us who have experienced pregnancy loss know, it is important to our healing to feel like someone somewhere understands and has walked the same road.",1400371200,,1375,4.643153526970955

.
PAUL ADELSTEIN---excellent performance but I have not heard of many Angel Dads have affairs after the loss of their baby/
.
I am a nurse and a NILMDTS photographer, never, not once, have I witnessed our local hospitals in SC and their nurses every being so disrespectful to the Angel Baby and carrying it out in a box.  This just doesn't happen.
I have never taken photos of Angel Families the way ""a photographer"" was portrayed last night taking photos of the family with their Angel Baby.  I pose and I search for the proper lighting.  I bring along props such as baby hats, baby wraps and always bring a teddy bear for the family.

Though some people may have experienced their child taken away in a box and a photographer that didn't pose and just snapped photos, I can't deny that did not happen.
.
Just understand the average volunteer photographer does not pose families in such a shocking ""deer in the headlight"" looks.
With that being my biggest points of dislike,

I loved the movie.  I thought it was right on with a few exceptions.  But I can get around those few things as long as the public knows this is not how the baby is removed from the room.  This story does share every emotion involved with the loss of a child.

I was secretly hoping (& praying) that it would be a great movie, because there was so much riding on this and I did not want viewer to be disappointed or put off.  I saw the film last night and thought it was truly amazing.  This is the first time a film maker has tackled the painful and difficult topic of stillbirth and infant loss.  Sean Hanish created a beautiful, moving and honest film, a triumph, thanks to his authenticity and tasteful depiction of the loss of a baby, the hellish aftermath and the rocky path to healing.  There were so many moments in the film I was grateful to see shared with the audience, things that most people would never know or understand unless they have lived through the loss of a baby.  The only negative I have heard from any viewers was that they did not like the inclusion of infidelity in the story and felt it distracted from the main theme.  I would disagree, I think it is important to know that many marriages suffer and some collapse after such a devastating event.  I thought it was a realistic detail that did not take away from the overall plot.

The induction, delivery, and immediate post delivery was a powerful moment to watch - done perfectly.  I felt comforted when the doctor tells her that because of the death of her son, she is more available to children.  I think I am a very different mother than those that don't go through this tragedy.  There is a blessing in it.  I also like when she has her next child, and comments that she doesn't feel different.  Most people thought I would be 'better' after having another child.

6413405,4,B00KB8JB9M,"Return to Zero addressed for me the same emotional trauma that occurred when my wife and I lost our son of 16 weeks to an inexplicable infection and rupture of his amniotic sac.  We stayed for 37 hours at the hospital, in the maternity ward, after receiving the devastating news in the emergency room that our son, still perfectly alive, is in grave danger and they cannot save him so early still in utero. We waited while other new moms were welcoming their new child in other rooms, their cries of life drowning our silence and tears of pain.  We were induced, the delivery traumatic and D&C right after gave us so little time to say goodbye to my son that faded in my arms as his heartbeat slowed and gone still. I wished I took more pictures to showed he existed, the few mementos I have left I cherish as a father. They took him away in a medical waste hazard container instead of a paper box to hold until we arranged a cremation and I refused an autopsy because his tiny body had gone through enough pain.

This film allowed me to connect with my emotions again after six months. It made me think about how I responded and supported my spouse through the grieving we both suffered, and the difficulty we faced dealing with our friends and family eager for us to try again or get past our loss, which no parent can for as long as they lived.

I did not care for Aaron's escapism from his pain, which as a coping act was unnecessary and detracts from his suffering. It is too cliche of a male to seek comfort in sex when his manhood is in question. And it feels like a validation that it is a legitimate choice when it is not.

Minnie Driver did a great job, and though the film centers on a stillborn situation and touched on miscarriage, the rawness of loss and the emptiness it suddenly created, the loss of ""possibility"" for all of us was the most real thing.

Well done, and all of us thank you for the courage to tackle the subject.",1400371200,7,1943,4.30958904109589
6413406,5,B00KB8JB9M,"I went to the premier, my daughters name is in the credits. Here are my thoughts:
-This is 1 story of the 2.5 million still births a year. 1 in 4 pregnancies ends in miscarriage.
- Until this film, the struggle and heartache has been silent.
- There were things I could have done without ( the original version  had lots of language) and some things I would have liked. BUT, I remembered, this was THEIR experience. It is clearly stated as such.
-Things I didn't like: language, the intense intimate scene, and no scene showing her leave the hospital with empty arms
-Things done well: A clear depiction of the cultural struggle for validation we typically experience, the inclusion of concepts I didn't think of before living this** should we have discussed how we want to bury our child?** her milk coming in***being left with a nursery and gifts***feeling like people are afraid to be near you***husbands and wives grieving differently***that they are ALREADY parents BEFORE they ever conceive their rainbow*** Public recognition and declaration that this is not their first child and that they are parents of TWO.
- I found the delivery scene very painful. Our daughter died at 39 weeks and theirs at 38. The imagery was almost too much. It was gratefully brief. I was thankful it was included, but thankful it ended soon
-I was also pleased that they showed how challenging being pregnant again is, most of the public doesn't get it.

-All in all I am very grateful for this film. It helped my husband connect to surprised emotions at the delivery. It generated talk between us about her again.
- Although their story differs from mine, I am so happy something if finally being said. That the pain is recognized.

-- Ultimately, it is very important to choose whether or not to watch based on your grief journey. Will this be positive and healing or not? Do what feels right for you.
- You may or may not be ready for or want this,,, that's ok.
Know that you matter. Your children are remembered and an effort is being made.

The happiness I felt while I was pregnant with him I never regained with subsequent pregnancies. I was always fearful, afraid to get too close. Holding Alex was as amazing as it was heartbreaking. 7 Months after Alex was stillborn I had an 8 weeks along miscarriage. It was like pouring salt on a gaping wound. 13 months after the miscarriage I gave birth to my son Nicky, who suffers immensely. He was diagnosed at birth with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa, and was given a year to live. He is now 17 and struggling every day.

6413410,5,B00KB8JB9M,"This was not an easy movie to watch, but I'm glad I did. I had five miscarriages before ever having a live birth. People had many unintentionally awful things to say to me (God's will, everything happens for a reason, must have been something wrong with them, you can always try again, etc.) in an effort to comfort me. Those were the ones brave enough to mention it. Most people just pretended it hadn't happened. Eventually, I just stopped telling people, even family members, that I was (once again) pregnant.

While my experiences after my losses didn't mirror hers, my emotions certainly did. I had no babies to hold, so I held that pain close to my heart. I kept my feelings close to myself, and after the first few, I didn't even turn to my husband for comfort anymore. I lashed out, too, and I hated. Looking back on that time, I even startle myself remembering how much hate I held in my heart -- rage, anger, pain and hate. It was a terrible place to be.

Healing takes time, but even once you are able to function again and be happy again, you will always carry that little sad tender place in your heart because it's the place your babies belonged. It never heals over completely.",1400371200,2,1192,4.463302752293578

If you are dealing, or have had to deal with a tragedy like this, you absolutely need to see this film. I personally took alot out of it, not having such a loss myself, but it was brilliant at capturing what true loss is like, and how ultimately we can find a way out of our darkness. It helped me understand loss and resilience of the human spirit.",1400371200,,846,4.360759493670886

It was a different cause and some of the experience was a bit different, but the feelings from the loss were so similar.  I have seen comments all over the internet from those who watched this movie last night and I feel has had such an impact on so many.  Those that had had losses and hadn't had contact with others, suddenly feeling as if they were no longer alone.  Those who hadn't had losses who were beginning to understand a bit of what people go through (hopefully more people will be truely supportive of those who have babies who die).

I came to find out that stillbirths are SO common, however, no ones talks openly about this subject! No one publically wants to admit there is this sad and terrible loss in our modern society.  How can all our technology in the world today not save these little angels?  This was my argument. How was my son not saved?

Return To Zero encompasses my emotions and feelings.  My husband and I handled our loss in a different way, but the pain is the same.  The feelings are the same, we have 3 boys, one is just waiting for us in Heaven.

If you have experienced the loss of a baby/child, or know some one who has, this movie is for you! This movie can open the doors to talk and change! You can continue living through your loss! There is life after.  The pain doesn't go away and I'm feel like I'll never truly have all my pieces back together again, but I am alive and I can carry the memory of our Baby David with us in my heart.

Minnie Driver's best movie by far. Every emotion she portrayed was spot on and never seemed fake or overacting. I think this is a movie everyone should watch and see. Yes, it was heartbreaking and I cried my eyes out but in the end, it was uplifting and just goes to show never give up and keep the faith.

Although I am glad this subject is being brought more and more into the light, I was incredibly hurt and disappointed at how the loss of a miscarriage was still thought of as ""less."" I don't care what stage of pregnancy you are in, when you lose a baby - you lose everything you thought that baby would be.

6413453,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Return to Zero is an absolute perfect portrayal of the journey of baby loss. I have never felt more understood than in the 2 hours that the film lasted. The return policy scene... lived it! And along with the return policy scenario came the return policy dilema within your head. Should you return it? Or keep it as a memory? Should you return it? Or keep it because it belonged to your child... and returning it just sounds cold and cruel? Well, in the first few months after the loss, in that complete and utter darkness, all you want to do is ""get rid"" of all the baby stuff because its all material. And your mad at it for being there when you no longer have a baby that would need it. You wish it ""understood"" the situation and went away on its own so you wouldnt have to endure the heart crippling task of having to see it each day, knowing the story behind it. I kept some of Enzo's baby clothes and his stroller, which I had to see every day. And as much as it broke my heart, it mended it right back up when I see Kenzo, my rainbow baby, using it now.
The film opened up some old wounds. Wounds that needed to be opened. It also helped me understand that I am not alone. The list of babies, including my very own- Enzo, broke me. The long, long list. Their innocent, pure lives taken so soon. Why? This film does not answer that question, which we all have asked ourselves repeatedly but it did take the words right out of my mouth.
Every single word that was said in that movie was so accurate. I have lived every situation to the T. I saw myself reflected in Maggie (Minnie Driver). Which by the way, hit it out of the park! Left me in awe, how someone who has not gone through it could have portrayed it so perfectly!
Every situation so accurately detailed, portraying each and every one of our lives. Their lives. I loved it! I cried through it! It helped me and it hurt me. It was pure perfection. The perfect depiction of my journey through baby loss.
The silence is broken. Lets keep it up! For our sweet, beautiful babies.

There's an utter absence of artifice -- just straight ahead, honest conveyance of a harrowing story.  Though it's very much about death, what surprised me the most is how much it's about life too.  It's quite remarkable that the filmmakers managed to tell a story that could have been exclusively depressing but instead left me feeling inspired about just what a tremendously precious gift life is.

6413461,5,B00KB8JB9M,"When you read the synopsis of Return to Zero you may think you know what to expect from it.  You probably think that it's a couple of hours of a sad film about a sad topic.  But to leave your thoughts there is to do a disservice to the brilliant writing, the authentic performances and the true story behind this film, which have come together here to create a film that's not to be missed.

While some may perceive Return to Zero as a movie about death, it is more accurately a film about life, relationships and humanity.  It's an honest look at what happens when our hearts are shattered and the choices that we make on the road to putting them back together.  If we are honest with ourselves what that includes is tears and laughter, celebration and sorrow, growth and change.  Return to Zero delivers all of that and more.

As both a filmmaker and the mother of a baby who died, I recognize that Return to Zero is anything but your typical movie.  It's a catalyst for conversation, understanding and healing.  Watching this film can truly make a difference not only in your own life, but in how grieving families are perceived, represented and supported in the world.",1400198400,7,1172,4.516587677725118
6413462,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Return to Zero does a remarkable job of capturing the emotional journey of having a stillborn child.  It is based on a true story, but similar to millions of true stories  3 million babies are born still every year throughout the world.  In the U.S., 1 in 170 babies is stillborn (thats one every 21 minutes) and more than 60% of the time, no one knows why.

In our society, people simply don't talk about this devastating loss that rocks marriages, families and communities.  I believe this film will change that.  The story is powerful, the acting is remarkable and the images are memorable; it will start the conversation.  It will raise awareness and our collective consciousness about stillbirth and get people talking about it.  I am biased, having been involved as an active supporter, but I think film will be significant  and award winning.
It is moving, it is emotional, but most of all it is IMPORTANT.",1400198400,5,913,4.727848101265823
6413463,5,B00KB8JB9M,"In one of his interviews, Sean Hanish (writer, director, co-producer, and bereaved father) said, ""There are stories you want to tell.  And, there are stories you have to tell.  This is a story we have to tell.""  This is one of the truest statements that describes the necessity of this film.  There are so many bereaved parents that are left feeling alone in their grief - the depths of their loss minimized, their emotions not validated, and society trying to rush them through their sadness in order to 'get back to normal'.  Similarly, there are so many loved ones of bereaved parents who don't know how to help, are clueless as to what is supportive vs. judgmental, and are truly misinformed about what actually does bring us comfort.
What we want is ACKNOWLEDGMENT.  We want our grief acknowledged; we want our children acknowledged; and, we want our parenthood acknowledged.
Return to Zero accomplishes this goal in so many ways.  It validates those who have experienced child death by showing them that they are truly not alone.  It allows them to see a couple experience the rawness and intensity of emotion in the aftermath.  It gives them a window into how some couples find it difficult to communicate or find comfort.  And, it provides hope in knowing that our children that died are ALWAYS a part of our family - even when healthy subsequent children are brought into the world.
It also provides family and friends of bereaved parents with a glimpse into our completely crushed world.  For those who have never experienced the death of a child, please watch this film.  You will learn very quickly what NOT to say to a grieving individual.  And, you, most definitely, WILL gain compassion, understanding, and sensitivity for all that your loved ones have gone through.
I can not express my gratitude enough to Sean and Kiley Hanish, the amazing cast/crew, and all individuals involved in this film.  Together, we are changing the ways in which the world faces child death, grief and healing.",1400198400,48,2004,4.838709677419355

Having watched several personal friends go through similar experiences, I know all to well the feelings of helplessness one can have, not knowing what to say or how to support them, but watching this deeply truthful story unfold from this couple's perspective really helped me understand (and it was different than what I would have thought which I guess is why its so important to talk about things.)

On a more superficial note the acting was amazing and there was way more humor in this movie than I would have expected, sprinkled in all the right places. If you have been through this experience or know others who have, I highly recommend it.",1400198400,6,680,4.666666666666667
6413465,5,B00KB8JB9M,"by Sherokee Ilse, author of Empty Arms: Coping with Miscarriage, Stillbirth, and Infant Death

This is a first and it will be talked about as a ground-breaker for years to come!  Return to Zero, based on a true story of love for a baby who is stillborn (dies prior to birth), is a beautiful, poignant, honest tale told by Sean Hanish, a father  who lived it.  He is the writer, director, and co-producer.  This is the first drama EVER on stillbirth, and Sean's first (but not last!) movie.

Hanish is a master craftsman!  This movie staring A-list actors like Minnie Driver, Paul Adelstein, Kathy Baker and Alfred Molina, is artfully done with humor, depth of character, intriguing flashbacks, and emotion.  The acting is superb and messages are woven throughout in natural ways.  You'll want to watch it over and over to catch the deeper meanings and see the things you missed the first time around.

If you have had a baby die, you'll see yourself in it and feel less alone and understood.  If you love someone who has had a baby die, you'll learn from it and realize that it is not too late to share your new understandings with the parents.  If you have never been close to this experience, you will be amazed and grateful that now you know what to say and what not to say to parents after such a tragedy.  Given that over 26,000 babies are stillborn in the US, probably close to a million miscarriages, and worldwide the numbers are staggering, chances are everyone will know someone who has been there.",1400198400,5,1508,4.582089552238806
6413466,5,B00KB8JB9M,"A good story keeps the audience captivated, wanting to see it through.  A great one makes you feel it like you experienced it yourself and keeps you thinking about it long after you've put the book down or walked out of the theater.  Maybe because you have been through something similar; maybe because the writing and acting are done so well that it just feels so real; maybe both.  Return to Zero is just one of those powerful, gripping stories.  It's about a couple living the dream until it's shattered by the loss of their baby and how that affects them and everyone around them.  Everyone has something to learn from this powerful story.  Minnie Driver and Paul Adelstein deliver a fantastic performance, as well as the rest of the all-star supporting cast.  I highly recommend everyone watch Return To Zero when you get the chance!",1400198400,6,838,4.698630136986301
6413467,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Return To Zero is a wonderful film about the triumph of the human spirit. It is raw and honest, touching and cathartic. This is the movie that pulls the veil off the shroud of silence the loss community had been forced to live behind. But it is a film not just for the loss community - it is as much about living as it is about loss. From this film a new understanding will emerge. The acting is devastating and funny and true. Minnie Driver is wonderful. Paul Adelstein gives a beautiful and nuanced performance of a man in grief. Tara Shafer",1400198400,5,543,4.333333333333333
6413468,5,B00KB8JB9M,"There are books and movies I know I *should* read or watch, and then there are the books and movies I actually *do* read or watch. I expected Return to Zero to be a ""should"" -- I didn't expect that I would be entertained as well as uplifted.",1400198400,5,241,4.041666666666667
6413469,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Even outside its message, this is simply a very, very good movie. I'm overwhelmed by the courage it took for Minnie Driver to accept this role and even more impressed by the heart and passion she put into it. I watch a lot of indie films and sometimes you can see that, like a self-published book, it could have used more funding for things like editing or even the filming itself. Not so here: this is an A-list cast in an A-list production and filmmaker Sean Hanish did a spectacular job putting a heartfelt screenplay on film. Kudos to all involved!",1400198400,17,552,4.475247524752476
6413470,5,B00KB8JB9M,A beautifully wriiten & directed film which tackles a difficult subject with both grace and humor. The performances are universally outstanding and the laugh out loud moments are pleasantly surprising. Bravo!,1400198400,9,208,5.741935483870968
6413471,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Picture this if you willWe are all walking in a dark, shadowy tunnel. We know there are many of us in here, but we can barely see each other. I know my pain, but I can only imagine yours. Because each of us grieve separately and differently. Sharing our stories of life and death, love and loss, grief and healing, allows us to extend our hand to those who are lost in this tunnel. It may not make the journey go any faster, but it will let you know that you are not alone, and offer hope along your way. Sean Hanish and his wife Kiley, share the story of their son Norbert in the new movie Return to Zero and extend their hand to you in your journey as a bereaved parent. Take advantage of those who are not afraid to walk or sit in the dark with you. And if you are not a bereaved parent, try to empathize with their story and the loss of others. Sure it is sad. It might make you uncomfortable. You might think something like this could never happen to you. Then remember we used to be you, and once walked in your same shoes. - Cheryl Haggard Cofounder Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep",1400198400,32,1083,4.065420560747664
6413472,5,B00KB8JB9M,"Return to zero is a funny, emotional, and brilliant movie. It raises awareness and gives a voice to all those families who suffer in silence.
Minnie Driver is excellent in playing that mom to be whose life is about to change forever.  The cast is phenomenal, from Paul Adelstein to Fred Molina, Kathy Bates,  Connie Nielsen & Sarah Jones ...they tell us a beautiful story based on the writer and his wife's true story. I laughed, cried and learned a lot through that movie. I highly recommend it, 5 stars!!",1400198400,6,506,4.611111111111111
6413473,5,B00KB8JB9M,"This is courageous film making, raw, harrowing at times but also bizarrely --  considering the subject matter -- also full of humanity, warmth, humor, and above all truth. It's this honest approach that really stays with you after viewing. There are some moments in this story that will move you in ways you're not expecting, that are quite simply evisceratingly powerful because they are bare, unadorned, sublimely affecting markers in a couple's unthinkable journey.  5 stars.",1400112000,17,478,5.276315789473684

8657288,2,B00KB8JB9M,"Love that this addressed the issue of infant loss!  However, too much Hollywood influence in parts.  I thought, or had hoped, this would reflect more common everyday lives.  I so wanted to be able to give this a higher rating!  Having experienced the joy of meeting our granddaughter and the pain of saying goodbye all in the same moment, I had hoped this would have focused more on stillbirth and not so much ***spoiler alert!!!!!*** the office affair.",1524528000,,453,4.769230769230769

8657290,2,B00KB8JB9M,"This is a good movie.  I am only giving it a 2 star because it pisses me off, from the point of someone who had lived this situation and had a full term stillbirth. 1. Your doctor doesn't hid the ultrasound monitor and refuse to show you proof, they show you so you can see for yourself and process. 2. The ultrasound doesn't stay on the head. And 3. They DON'T take your baby away in a cardboard box!!  It's placed in a bassinet and taken to the morgue.",1489795200,,454,4.089887640449438
