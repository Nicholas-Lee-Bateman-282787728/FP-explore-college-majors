6791316,5,B00P9UVC0I,"It is so awesome that they are finally releasing the Japanese series that Power Rangers is based on in America.  Power Rangers has been so popular for so long it's a wonder they never did this sooner.  I grew up watching Power Rangers, then a few years ago I heard about Super Sentai and found a few episodes, the difference between them was like night and day, with Sentai being the day.  Hopefully when they finish with each of the seasons that have Power Ranger equivilants, they will continue on with the ones that preceeded Power Rangers.  My only fear is that they will put what fans refer to as ""Dubtitles"" on these DVDs, meaning subtitles that use the terms for characters, objects and places that the English dubbing company came up with, rather than the original Japanese terms.",1415923200,9,788,4.64748201438849
6791317,5,B00P9UVC0I,I am a huge fan of both Power Rangers and Super Sentai series. I am so excited that this series is finally coming to DVD. I grew up with MMPR so seeing this series come to DVD is so awesome!. Power Rangers: Super Sentai Zyuranger The Complete Series is a must have DVD for anyone who is a fan of Power Rangers. I have been wanting to get this series on DVD for a while now and I am really glad that this series is out on DVD.,1415404800,3,425,3.840909090909091
6791318,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I have not ever watched all of Zyuranger,but that was because of time,and i hope that they continue on with Dairanger and Kakuranger even though we didn't use the whole footage for the Power Rangers equivalents.",1415232000,6,211,4.888888888888889
6791319,5,B00P9UVC0I,THANK YOU!!!! Brian Ward is seriously the best thing to happen to power rangers/super sentai. Finally we get these on DVD. I am going to preorder right away and I am praying that more sentai seasons get released! This is a must buy!!,1415232000,7,233,4.441860465116279
6791320,5,B00P9UVC0I,"Prerelease excitement:
Finally! I've been waiting for this to become available for preorder since it was announced in the Summer of 2014.
For those who are uninformed, this is Kyry Sentai Zyuranger, the source material for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers season 1 & the basis for the suits later extensively used for seasons 2 & 3 to replace unusable footage from Dairanger & Kakuranger. Now, I really wish that Shout! & Saban had teamed up with FUNimation, or something to produce an English dub, reuniting most of the original cast of MMPR, as I know that could be done & I think most of them would be up for it.
Please preorder this. Whether you like this season, or not is irrelevant to what a huge step this is towards Super Sentai. I mean, officially fully-licensed, non-fansubbed releases of Super Sentai in America is a huge step for the franchise, plus it might give you a bigger appreciation for PR. If you wanna know what happened in the source material of such a nostalgic show, order this now to get it in February. If this sells well, we might see a fully-subbed release of Gokaiger, my favorite Sentai series in several years & not only on DVD, but Blu-Ray as well. Plus the movies. (Sighs) What a momentous occasion that'll be.
Note: I'll come back to this when it's released & give an in-depth review, as I'm sure there'll be plenty to talk about when it comes out. Shout's always done fantastic releases for their products & I have complete faith in them.

Full review:
This set is fantastic for being the 1st official Sentai release here in America. All of the episodes are on the discs & there's a bonus interview with Yuuta & a few suit actors from the series who played Geki & Burai in-suit from Power Morphicon 2014. It's subbed & edited for timing reasons, but also to speed over where the translator woman for the most part, who couldn't seem less interested in what she has to translate for most of the interview. Most of the questions were fair & were asked by older fans who've obviously seen not only Sentai & especially Zyuranger, but also other Tokusatsus, like Kamen Rider & the like. I personally recommend checking that out as it was a good watch.

Picture quality: 10/10. Minus some grain from being made in 1992-1993 in Japan & filmed on film, the picture is in great shape. Basically, if you remember what a lot of the fight footage in MMPR looked like, that's basically what this looks like. Definitely at least watchable.

Audio quality: 10/10. The audio is a Japanese 2.0 Dolby Digital language track that's well mixed, & there's no distortions or anything that I can hear wrong with the audio. One thing, which I'm sure is weird with the Japanese releases as well, is that Bandora's audio seems slightly out of sync with her mouth, or maybe was rerecorded in ADR, as her dialogue doesn't seem to be said with the same inflections as was said on set, or it might be off in some other regard as such. Otherwise, it's definitely a good audio transfer.

This is a really good set. Light on bonus features, but there are all of the episodes with subtitles for those who are not fluent in Japanese like me. I will warn parents when buying this for their kids. The subs do have swear words in them every so often, so be cautious when buying this if it's for your kids.",1415145600,45,3299,4.530201342281879
6791321,5,B00P9UVC0I,"This is the Japanese series that Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was based off of. In Japan these series are called ""Super Sentai"", Sentai is ruffly translated to ""Team"" or Task force"".

6791326,3,B00P9UVC0I,I was super excited about getting this DVD. However when it arrived the case was severely damaged and broken in several areas and the CD holders inside or broken as well. Obviously from other reviews it seems like everybody has the same issue with things breaking in relation to the case.

6791327,5,B00P9UVC0I,"Before Power Rangers, there is Super Sentai. This is the season how it all began for Power Rangers. I have been a Power Rangers fan for over 20 years since 1993 when Power Rangers come out until I watch Super Sentai online a few years ago. If you don't know what Super Sentai is? Super Sentai is the Japanese version of Power Rangers. Super Sentai came out in 1975, 18 years before Power Rangers come in air in 1993. Power Rangers was adapted from Super Sentai. This season is one of my favorite Super Sentai seasons. In this season, a pair of curious astronauts foolishly released a witch named Bandora (Rita Replusa in Power Rangers) and her gang of monsters from a seal that they had been sleeping for over a hundred million years. A kind and wise wizard named Barza (Zordon in Power Rangers) awakened 5 powerful warriors named Dinosaur Sentai Zyuranger to combat the evil witch and her gang of monsters. I gave this season a 5 star rating and I recommend this to Power Ranger fans.",1501113600,,985,4.5083798882681565
6791328,5,B00P9UVC0I,Awesome product!,1499558400,,16,7.5
6791329,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I liked this show, I now understood why Green ranger from MMPR was hardly present during episodes. I honestly don't look at the MMPR the same way after viewing Super Sentai Zyurangers. The missing pieces to the puzzle connected quite well. The japanese show had no problem putting kids in danger or adding in very slight sexuality. Less humor and more action outside of costume was a nice touch. I feel the characters are more likeable which steps away from the high school genre of MMPR. If you want original content and better story telling. Give Super Sentai a try.",1498608000,5,568,4.69

6791332,5,B00P9UVC0I,"This is honestly a great DVD collection. There's no fluff-- putting the DVDs in jumps straight to the main menu, which lists ""PLAY ALL / EPISODE SELECT / LANGUAGE"". It's pretty great. There are 10 discs, about 5 episodes on each. Can't wait to finish the series and order the next one.",1495670400,,285,4.5

6791334,5,B00P9UVC0I,"Originally I wasn't sure what to expect from this series since I hadn't seen much Japanese TV programs before, but eventually my curiosity about this series convinced me to try it. From the moment I watched the first episode I was hooked to this show, I found the characters to be very interesting and the adventures made a little bit more sense to the overall story then it had on Power Rangers. My favorite episode included Scary Riddes and Arise! Daizyujin, the fifth and sixth episode of the show and I also enjoyed episodes with Burai the DragonRanger, his characters story was very interesting. Overall I wasn't disappointed with this series and it only made me want to see more Super Sentai. For those unfamiliar with Super Sentai the audio of series is completely in Japanese with only English Subtitles, now while it didn't affect my enjoyment of the series I realize it may keep some from fully enjoying it.",1492128000,,917,4.7375
6791335,5,B00P9UVC0I,"Zyurangers Super Sentai is the Japanese television show that ran in the early 90's that directly inspired Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  Much like it's American counterpart, Super Sentai is a children show but it eases off on much of the very kiddy slapstick humor and even has more mature elements that adults can appreciate it.  As an adult, trying to go back and watch MMPR is painful and groan-inducing but Zyurangers is far easier to appreciate.

The tone of the two shows are really in stark comparison of each other when you watch them both side-by-side. For instance, Rita's reason for hating children in the original Sentai actually gives some depth to her character that is absent from the American version.  There is one episode where one of Rita's monsters is forced to fight just so her her unhatched children won't be destroyed, a layer MMPR avoids at all costs.  The background of the Rangers in Super Sentai is far more interesting as the mythology is richer and more interesting.  Rather than robotic vehicles, the ""zords"" are actually gods full of personality and even prejudices.  And the famed Green Ranger, whom is a bad ass in both versions, is far more of a tragic figure in the Japanese version.

MMPR used the Japanese footage for their monster scenes, but this can't be hidden at all times.  The observant eye will notice the details of many of the clues, such as the flimsy quality of the Ranger costumes when shot with the American actors without their helmets on, especially Green Ranger's shield.  Even more interesting, in the Japanese version the yellow ranger was a guy.  It's amazing for the phenom that the show in America was, how much of it was already delivered by these actors and crews over seas.

Anyway, it's totally worth checking out if you are into the MMPR mythos at all.  Even for Nostalgia sake, you can truly get more Ranger action but with grittier themes, a more rewarding mythology, stakes that are actually life and death for some characters, and hell, even a better theme song.",1491264000,,2031,4.768571428571429
6791336,5,B00P9UVC0I,"So, I'm a pretty big Power Rangers fan.  I was born in the 90s when the show began (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers began in '93, and I was born in '94).  In the long run of the series, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers has always been my favorite incarnation of the series.  It wasn't until I started high school that I learned about Super Sentai and its relationship with Power Rangers.

Now, in 2017, with Saban's Power Rangers film hitting theaters, I'm feeling both nostalgic and curious, so I decided to check Zyuranger (the incarnation of Super Sentai that would become Mighty Morphin Power Rangers).  Let me tell you, I am so happy I did.  I love the series.  In all honesty, I may even love it more than Power Rangers.

It has some of the same corniness that Power Rangers has, along with some of the more childish elements, but it also aims at adult audiences as well with its darker themes and imagery (Satan is a character for example, and the villain constantly conspires to murder children-- nothing too graphic mind you).

The acting is really good too.  It's much better than in Power Rangers (I'm not going to call the cast bad actors, for many of them, it was their first acting gig, so they were learning as they went along).  Speaking of acting, much of my praise at this series is aimed at Machiko Soga, who plays the series main villain, Witch Bandora (whose stock footage would later be used for Rita Repulsa).  She is the best part of the series and gives the best (and most fun) performance in the entire cast.

Overall, I'm so happy I bought this.  If you love Japanese shows and storytelling, or if you're a curious Power Rangers fan, I highly recommend it.",1490659200,4,1676,4.506622516556291
6791337,5,B00P9UVC0I,Classic! Really enjoyed this! Glad to finally have a chance to see this version.,1490400000,,80,4.785714285714286
6791338,5,B00P9UVC0I,"This original is the gritty reboot you need to watch. After finally coming across this version, I felt robbed in my childhood because Fox and Saban watered down and made a bastardized but entertaining version for American consumption. Hahaha",1490054400,,241,5.205128205128205
6791339,4,B00P9UVC0I,"Having seen Power Rangers back in the day I didn't quite get it.  I picked this up on a whim and now I think that I will be buying the rest of the shout factory releases one at a time.  Awhile back I lost my patience for badly cut Anime and I guess that it's the same thing here as I'd rather see the original show as it was presented in Japan and I wasn't disappointed. The ""ancient warriors"" premise is way more interesting than five random teenagers and the witch is way more evil and dark.  There are also some pretty silly episodes as well with a kid getting just as big as the giant robot!(by a trick by our evil friends of course).  There is no Zordon but a good magician who like an RPG character I know forgot his magic spells after battling Bandora(rita) a long time ago.  The Rangers spend alot of time helping kids as Bandora basically hates them.  The monster of the week is still around but sometimes kidnaps people and tries to use it against our heroes. The Green ranger first wakes up bent on revenge(being from the same era as the ancient warriors)  but turns good with the catch that because he was resurrected he doesn't have very long before his end.  Overall it has more levels than Power Rangers ever did",1489881600,,1227,4.304347826086956
6791340,5,B00P9UVC0I,Thank you shout factory!,1484352000,,24,5.25
6791341,5,B00P9UVC0I,My son was thrilled with this gift. It was exactly what he wanted.,1483488000,,66,4.153846153846154
6791342,5,B00P9UVC0I,"For those of you who remember the olden days of Rita, Goldar, Finster, Zordon, Alpha 5 and the rest, you might debate this purchase.
Either you feel that you are too old for what was a children's show or, if you still enjoy the occasional marathon of the classic, you could debate why you should bother spending the money for something you have effectively seen before.

If that is what you think, then stop...right...there.

While the characters are familiar in design, their behavior is quite a bit different. The villains are multidimensional to a degree, their plots are a lot darker, and the good guys struggle a heck of a lot more.
Don't believe me? Then here are a few minor spoilers.
---
----
------
---------

The Witch Bandora (Rita) freely discusses sacrificing  children multiple times.
The Zords are literally the gods of the Power Ranger Cultures
Zordon does not exist, but the original character can't actually use any magic.
Hell is invoked a bunch of times to gather new dark powers.

So yeah, if you enjoyed the Power Rangers as a child, then don't worry. This series has enough new material that you will barely recognize a thing.
In fact, it will probably encourage you to watch the original again just to compare the evil plot in the Japanese versus the Americanization.

As to the discs themselves, this is a bare bones release. There are a couple of special features on the final disc, but for the most part this is just a pure series of episodes ready for a marathon!",1483142400,2,1491,4.67175572519084

6791358,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I grew up with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as a kid, but as I got older I started to realize just how cheesy it was, yet on the other hand there was a magnet about it that had me coming back to it.  As I watched I started noticing how some things were different than others like video contrast and scenery.  When I heard about this series, the Japanese version, I had to get it.  When I finally got it today, I was hooked right from the getgo.  I felt young again and old and nostalgic simultaneously.  This version is 100x better than the silly American version.  The villains really feel like a threat, the story is involving (yet dark at times), the protagonists are way more likeable, and more believable personality (even the mechas have personality to them), and most importantly this has messages for both kids AND adults alike rather than just kids without making parents suffer through mindless nonsense.

Parental Advisory: This version is darker than the American version in terms of tone, yet simultaneously balances light and darkness together.  There are some moments of bleakness and moments that can frighten little children.  One example is in episode two where Dora Skelton reassembles himself, he makes a haunting sound.  In other episode two rangers grasp an evil sword which turns them temporarily into evil monsters with scary faces (even though these scenes are brief).  The violence though still mild is a little stronger than the American version (Mei's arrows actually pierce some monsters and Dan's lance impales one as well).  Finally there's some mild language such as d*** and h*** (one ranger tells a Dora monster to ""go to h***).  I suggest this series to the 8+ crowd with parental supervision.",1465171200,3,1732,4.830508474576271

6791364,5,B00P9UVC0I,"INTRODUCTION: As you can tell from my reviews, I love Power rangers.  So it was only natural that I checked out the original Sentai.  I only really got into Sentai last year.  I did watch some Sentai a few years before then. The only Sentai I watched were all of Zyuranger, the first 20 episodes of Dairanger and a episodes of Ohranger.  As of this writing I have finished 11 different series and counting.  As soon as I heard that Zyuranger came to DVD here, I got excited.  I made sure to buy it as soon as I could after it was released, and really enjoyed seeing it again on DVD.

For many people I believe that this is the best possible choice for the first Sentai to watch and Im sure many of those people started with this one on their own initiative.  No prize for guessing why.  Its the one that all us 90s kids knew and loved as the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  I admit that I still love seasons 2 & 3 as well as some of the first season (the important episodes still hold up, a couple of the filler episodes are better than the stories they were adapted from, and shortly after the Zyu2 episodes start the show becomes really enjoyable and stays that way for the rest of the season) but the Sentai series are better.  I can still enjoy both on different levels.

Well, enough build-up.  Heres my review.  I will be using this format for all my other Sentai reviews, because theres always so much to talk about.  I have to talk about sections of the show as a whole, grading the individual episodes isn't going to work here.

THE HEROES: While they weren't the most memorable Sentai group the Zyurangers definitely weren't the worst either.  Geki got the most time in the spotlight (partially thanks to his arc with Burai), but since I really like him thats not a problem.  I also really like Goushi, and I liked Boi and Mei too.  Dan was my least favorite, but he was okay.  It seems hard to explain it in writing, but while watching this Sentai I got a feel for the characters.  Burai was the best though.  Apart from Hayate (Ginga Green), hes probably my favorite Green Sentai member.  I also liked Barda.  Whil not the most interesting mentor figure, he was still likeable and a decent character.  I wish Zordon had been a real person instead of a talking CGI head.

THE VILLAINS: This featured a mostly good set of villains.  Bandora is one of the most memorable villains in all of Sentai.  While Rita was pretty much a joke for nearly all of her appearances, Bandora is anything but.  Apart from being more bloodthirsty, her hatred of children was sometimes disturbing.  Early on, she put 2 children in an abnormally slow death trap just so she could watch them squirm.  Her origin was interesting, though I don't see how anyone could feel sorry for her.  Griffozer and Lami were great too, and I liked Pleprechaun.  Though is it just me, or did he not have as much screen time as his PR counterpart Finster?  A pity, because I like Finster a lot for some reason.  Maybe because and Scorpina are the only 2 villains from the first season who never annoy me, but I still like him.  My least favorite villains were those 2 guys who did nothing except provide a few laughs.  What were their names?  Oh yeah, Tophat & Bookrack.  Well they did have a good episode or two I think they could have been written out of the series without losing much.

MECHA: After all these years, I still love the mecha.  Apart from the Dinobots, robot dinosaurs don't get any cooler than this.  And when combined, they look very impressive.

STORY:  The story, while not as involving or interesting as other Sentai series or even the best Power Rangers series was still solid.  My biggest complaint only came in hindsight. That it, after watching other Sentai I realized that it was more kid friendly compared to them.  Almost every Sentai has a few obligatory episodes with kids, but this seems to be the one with the most.  Most of them were well told so its not a bad thing; it just keeps it from being my favorite Sentai.  But even with all the kids, this is still much more mature than the Power Rangers version.  The best parts of the series were the parts about Burai.  He was really cool.  It was interesting seeing a Ranger starting out as a real villain then becoming good later on.  Not every episode with him in was excellent, but all the episodes that moved the plot forward were.

SPOILERS ON:
Poor, poor Burai.  I couldn't believe the tragic fate that befell him while he was asleep.  I was hoping he would get better, but as everyone knows he died.  His death will go down as one of the saddest moments in Sentai history.  The finale was excellent too, apart from one big plot hole.  Instead of imprisoning the guardian beasts, why didn't Bandora just destroy them?  Maybe she wanted to savor the victory, or couldn't destroy them yet.  Its not as bad as some things so I won't complain.

OVERALL: Zyuranger is definitely a quality show.  While I admit that it probably won't make my top 10 Sentai list its still worthwhile, especially if you loved Mighty Morphin back in the day.  You could do worse for your first Sentai (like Changeman, Sun Vulcan or Go-Onger; I haven't finished any of those 3 but from what Ive seen the first 2 have nothing on Zyuranger, and Go-Onger is currently at the very bottom of my Sentai watch list).  If you saw other Sentai first (or didn't grow up with the original Power Rangers) you might not enjoy this series as much.  But for me, I will always remember it as my first Sentai and even if I had seen other Sentai first Im sure I still would have loved it.

6791367,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I love that Shout Factory is releasing these for all of us to enjoy, now many more people can now discover and enjoy all super sentai shows. I remember back in 2010 when i first discovered Super Sentai and Zyuranger I wished that there was a DVD set and translated professionally, since all I had was YouTube fan subs, which could do the job but sometimes the quality sucks/some episodes aren't subtitled at all.

There was only was like two times the subtitles were off a tad? The first case was one sentence had a bit of a screw up on the font and had like a line through it or something but never happened again. The second time was they'd put a "" ? "" at the end of a sentence that didn't actually need it >.> so it was odd but only happen once or twice. Its a minor thing but still should be noted and doesn't ruin the experience overall.

The extra on the set is pretty great that the Zyuranger panel was translated and the audio was excellent. Since when i originally watched it on youtube it was hard to hear from peoples recordings. They also edit it a bit and have subtitles for the questions being asked too since sometimes you cant hear the person at all so they remove those bits from the fans.

Overall I'm ultra happy with this and it was worth every penny! Highly recommend it.",1455580800,,1292,4.26530612244898

The story turns out was when 5 warriors from the dinosaur kingdom tribes have reawaken from their long slumber to defeat the evil forces of a witch named Bandora (Who you guys remember as Rita). They must defend the children of Japan and protect the Dinosaur eggs from them before the dinosaurs are truly extinct. This is the 16th season of the Japanese series called Super Sentai. I'm glad they added subtitles though. I still admire the Power Rangers, but this series had made a lot more sense than any American series.

6791392,5,B00P9UVC0I,"This series completely blew me away. I don't even know where to begin. The Zyuranger characters were so cool. I loved the way each warrior had a traditional/ancient style weapons to coincide with their ""ranger"" weapons. And even though this is considered a kids show, the acting, intensity, and emotional depth can sometimes be quite poignant. You sometimes get a level of pathos that you never got from MMPR. Not that is was their intention in the first place. And that's why I personally would not like to have this show dubbed. As I did a little research I found out that even though this was the series that triggered off MMPR, this is actually the 16th series in a long line of Super Sentai shows. I believe there are 38 in all, so far.  I digress. What also was appealing to me was how the series took its time to build the characters. The first episode established the villains. The next episode introduced the heroes. The third episode took us on the journey of them acquiring their weapons. The fourth episode was them being assigned their Guardian Beasts, known as Zords in the Power Rangers franchise. Here's a little spoiler: The guarding beasts sometimes come to the rescue without being summoned. Each beast has an emotional connection to each warrior and they also speak to the Zyurangers. Not with their mouths moving, but in a god like celestial manner. :End Spoiler. For me another great appeal was my favorite guardian beast of them all. Dragon Caesar! Dragonzord in the U.S. version. If you happen to be like me and the Dragonzord is your favorite too you will love this show. You get a lot more on screen time from him (yeah I consider it male), and the picture is much cleaner and sharper. If there is a down side it was simply that I found myself for a while hoping to hear the really cool rock/ metal music I've been accustomed to when the action was about to throw down. Well anyway that's it. Do yourself a big favor and get this DVD set. It'll probably be the best piece of entertainment you've seen in a very long time.",1437868800,2,2047,4.532432432432432

6791398,4,B00P9UVC0I,"I remember watching Power Rangers as a kid.  That show was hugely popular 20 years ago, but I stopped watching and caring about the show after the 2nd Season.  I also did not realize the show was using footage from a Japanese TV show, though I did notice at times as a kid how Power Rangers wasn't always well done.  I wish it was more common knowledge back then that Power Rangers was from this TV show, I don't remember kids saying it.  We also can ask what if this show aired in the U.S. dubbed or even subtitled?  I feel like they should have shown us where the original show came from.
Anyway, I got the disk and I've seen all the 50 episodes.  Nowadays, you can buy entire seasons of TV shows on disk including this TV show with English subtitles.  Like my title says, if I were to watch 50 Power Rangers episodes I'd feel like I was wasting my time watching a cheesy kids show.  It does not feel like a waste of time watching this TV show as it's better done than the Power Rangers and a better show.  Maybe the background music isn't as good, but it's more thought out of than Power Rangers.  The plot seems to make a little more sense and this show has a darker atmosphere.  We also seem to get to know the characters in this show a little better, as they seem more than people who hang around their high school or the Youth Center, Juice Bar like in Power Rangers.  So, I'm happy to have watched the show as it makes more sense and is a fun entertaining show to watch with more depth of character.  This show is even slightly older than the Power Rangers, but it doesn't feel as old and it definitely works for over 20-years later.
If you're a fan of the Power Rangers, I'd strongly recommend you watch this show.  You'll get to see where all this action footage came from, basically how the Power Rangers even became an idea in the first place.  I'm sure most of you can agree with me that this show seems more original and more thought out of than the Power Rangers.",1435363200,,1978,4.223404255319149

6791400,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I've been a Power Rangers fan my whole life, with the show beginning the year after I was born. Since I lived and breathed this show for so many years, it's ironic that I was never aware of it's source, Super Sentai, until I was well into high school. I didn't think I'd ever get the chance to see the show, but I'm glad that Shout Factory has proven me wrong!

Apparently drunk off their success with the Power Rangers DVD sets, Shout Factory has apparently decided that the next logical step was to bring the source material stateside. But how would you market something that the masses has never heard of? Obviously, by banking it on it's link with an established property.

For those who don't know, Power Rangers is not a wholly American creation. The show uses action footage from the Japanese series Super Sentai, which is dubbed over with American actors, while simultaneously filming new scenes with the American actors to create an entirely different show. And boy, are they different!

Though both are children's shows, Zyuranger (the series in this set, and the primary inspiration for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) has a much darker tone and deeper story and mythology than MMPR, as well as simply being downright bizarre. Whereas MMPR featured ""teenagers with attitude,"" Zyuranger had five warriors from the past revived from suspended animation to fight the Witch Bandora (Rita in MMPR) and her gang of minions. Much like the Power Rangers, the Zyurangers of the title use a morpher to transform into super powered warriors who pilot giant machines that combine to form an even bigger robot.

Those familiar with MMPR will recognize the action and that gives this show an air of familiarity. But the all-new, darker (sometimes downright bleak and depressing) story, as well as the serialized style of the episodes, gives the whole thing a fresh feel. It's also great to compare Zyuranger with MMPR Season 1 to see how the footage was adapted for the American show, and some could even come away with a new appreciation for the creators of MMPR, having to get clever at times with their story writing and editing to make the scenes fit. And the fifty episodes are spread over 10 discs, making the twenty-something year old show look crystal clear.

Though the set is light on special features, which consists of a sole taping of a convention panel, fans of Power Rangers, be they young or old, new or old-school, should definitely make this 10-disc set a must-own for their Power Rangers DVD collection, but casual viewers might be a bit pit off by the bizarreness of the show. Though, fans of the cheesy Saturday night Sy-Fy channel B-movies would definitely dig this.",1433894400,5,2683,4.811279826464208

What bugs me though is the translation.  There are countless fan-subs out there that are better quality.  The subs in this just seem slapped together.  There are also some parts where I don't think it's translated accurately.  I've watched enough sentai series to pick up a little Japanese (I'm not sure whether to be proud or ashamed), and some of it just seems off.

It meant I could watch the shows in a format that would be conducive to the profits of the companies involved. I would have bought the series from Japan but two things are wrong with that: 1.) No subtitles and 2.) One R2 DVD volume cost anywhere from $60-$120 American before the fees.

The plot: Long ago, during the Age of the Dinosaurs, there lived special humans who evolved from dinosaurs and Ice Age mammals. But a terrifying witch named Bandora attempts taking over Earth. But she is sealed away in a jar on planet Nemesis. Taking no chances, 5 warriors, one from each of the tribes, are sealed away guarded by the White Mage Barza.

Cut to present day (1992) Japan. Barza is working as a groundskeeper for a condominium. He finds out that 2 astronauts have released Bandora and rushes to released the 5 warriors from their 170 million year sleep.

With Bandora released, the fight between good and evil begins.

I remembered that, in spite of the faithfulness to the story overall... I didn't like how wordplay was handled. But seeing as this was somewhat aimed at those whose Japanese is not at my level, I conceded.",1430611200,2,1227,4.589041095890411

FAR more interesting characters, way more epic story and way higher stakes at risk than Angel Grove being stomped by giant monsters. The dinosaurs do more than just fuse into the Megazord. Each villain has their own fun personality. And the witch Bandora is more than just some hag who wants to conquer Earth. She has reason, motive, and the power to do as she pleases. And I have to say, the band of ancient warriors from clans based on dinosaurs (Though TERRIBLY inaccurate in real history wise) is infinitely more interesting than 5 teenagers with attitude.
I'm not saying I hate Power Rangers. I watched ALL of the original dinosaur commanding, Megazord driving Power Rangers as a kid and when asked which series was my favorite, I will always point to the very first. I AM saying that I wish I had this show to watch as a kid INSTEAD. It's smarter, it's fun, and, yeah, the effects are old; but we were KIDS. We wouldn't have been able to tell the difference! We would have seen giant dinosaurs fighting monsters the size of sky scrapers and our eyes would have been glued to the television. Not to mention, it didn't try to force feed a lesson down your throat every episode like they were trying to be a PSA. Sure, there are some lessons to be had (Such as What is the only sure thing in life [Answer: JUSTICE!!]), but you never feel like they were being driven in with a hammer. They came naturally through the story.
For someone who doesn't mind some old effects like jump cuts and fireworks, Super Sentai Zyuranger is a must have for any that love a good story.",1428710400,,1750,4.437888198757764

If you're unfamiliar with Super Sentai, Zyuranger is the series they based ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" on; using the Japanese fight footage and villains, whilst shooting American actors to fill in the civilian parts. Whilst Mmpr is the first Power Rangers series, Zyuranger is actually the 16th Super Sentai, however each series is unrelated to the last so feel free to start here. Zyuranger is just as great as Mmpr, perhaps even better. The action and choreography is great and the tone is pretty light but it has plenty of dark moments. This is a must see for any true Power Rangers fan and a must buy for any loyal Super Sentai fan in the West.",1427414400,3,918,4.5636363636363635

6791432,5,B00P9UVC0I,"Zyuranger is such an excellent show. I first became interested in tokusatsu a couple of years ago, when I discovered that all Power Rangers shows borrow their fight footage from Japan. Zyuranger was the first tokusatsu show I watched all the way through, and man did I make a good choice. This show is darker, wittier, and just overall smarter than Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was. If you've ever been a fan of any Power Rangers, you owe it to yourself to check out this classic show.

Any gripes I might have with the set are minor. Goshi does look like he was poorly photoshopped onto the cover, but perhaps this was due to the limited amount of photos available from the '90s? The art is fine otherwise, and I REALLY like that the Japanese name is center-stage at the top. The subs are a little weird at times... They decided to spell the name of the Zyuranger's mecha ""Daizyuzin"", even though it's pronounced ""Daijuujin"". Daizyuzin is correct... sort of. (Nihon-Shiki romanization is usually frowned on in English translations.) Still, every other translation before now went with ""Daizyujin"", a compromise which works MUCH better than the other options. Also, they subbed ""Kyouryuu Sentai Zyuranger"" as ""Dinosaur Squadron Zyuranger"". Why not ""Dinosaur Sentai Zyuranger""? I mean, we all know we're watching a Sentai show, so people aren't going to be confused by that word... and ""Squadron"" doesn't work at all...

All that being said, some cringe-inducing flukes are to be expected when adapting Japanese things for American audiences, and Shout Factory at least managed to get SOME things right. They translated Ryugekiken as ""Dragon-downing Sword""... Just.. why? Though, granted, the Zyusouken is still the Zyusouken. Otherwise, the set is very straightforward, and that's all it needs to be. Easily worth the $40.

Keep bringing the tokusatsu, Shout Factory, and we'll keep buying it.",1426982400,,1893,5.060897435897436

Considering the only way for people in other countries to watch Super Sentai tends to be fan subs, it's nice to see an official release for a Sentai. Zyuranger is full of the fun that comes along with Super Sentai. From the VERY Japanese mindset to comedy and the off the wall characters that appear it makes for a very fun show to watch not only by yourself but with family and friends. My kids really enjoyed watching this. One just enjoyed seeing the fights and laughing at the visual gags, while my oldest was working on her reading skills with the actual subtitles. So it was a win/win all around. I'm really hoping for more Super Sentai series getting official releases state side. Anywhere from the very first series all the way up to any future series.

To have Zyuranger, Mighty Morhpin Power Rangers' original source, released in North America is a great step promoting the original series to the world. How different is Zyuranger from Mighty Morphin?

6791450,4,B00P9UVC0I,"The first Super Sentai, and hopefully not the last, to be released in America and it's a pretty good start.
The basic story of Zyuranger is fairly simple as are most Sentai show's. The evil witch Bandora and her minions are unknowingly released after 170  million years of sleep and go off to conquer Earth. To stop them the wizard Barza awakens five sleeping warriors to fight off the witch. Aiding the five heroes in their battle are the guardian beasts, godly Dinosaur mecha's that combine to form the powerful god robot Daizyujin. Later joining them is Dragon Ranger Burai who comes with his own Gaurdian beast Dragon Ceaser.

The characters are fairly simple; Tyranno Ranger Geki is the Stoic leader, Mammoth Ranger Goushi is the strong silent guy, Tricera Ranger, Dan is the ladies man who's not the brightest, Petra Ranger Mei is the strong but caring girl of the team, and Tiger Ranger Boi is the Young and Nave member of the group. While it might sound like I'm bashing on the characters I'm really not trying to; all of the rangers are likable and the actors are able to play help portray them as such. The problem is they don't seem to evolve or show much complexity outside of their initial character traits. While do they have individual character moments and some backstory. Really the issue stems from how the formula for most episodes of Zyuranger is set up; most standard episodes involve some child with some sort of problem and is somehow roped into one of Bandora's plans (Or in some cases important to it.) This isn't a bad idea since Sentai is a kids show after all but more focus is given to the child's problem and to developing him than it is to the rangers themselves (with a few exceptions.) As for the villain's they are a primarily comic group that are rather entertaining to watch and at the end we learn about Bandora's past that shines light on her motivation and even makes her a pretty sympathetic character. Of course the character that is probably going to catch most peoples interest is Dragon Ranger Burai. Much like how Tommy from MMPR was Burai starts out as a villain (The main difference however is that it's by choice) of course he eventually turns good at the end of his arc but it manages to make probably the best parts of the series. We learn plenty about who Burai is, his past, and why he decides to fight against the Zyuranger's initially; the arc even gives Geki a lot of time to shine. Burai also has a pretty interesting story arc that lasts through most of the season. Generally some of the best parts of the series tend to be because of Burai. (Of course being the first sixth ranger to actually stay on the team probably helps with the memorability.)

Other things worth noting about the series is that the costume design (This includes the Mecha and Monsters as well) are great all great (Although this might be helped by PR nostalgia.) The fantasy settings made for the series do help to give the show some extra personality and the opening them for the series is pretty nice; although I never cared much for the ending.

While there are better Sentai series Zyuranger is still a good one to start on and for fans of Power Rangers or Tokusatsu fans in general should consider picking this series up. Plus for only $40 for 50 episodes you're getting a rather good deal and here's hoping we get Dairanger next.",1425772800,,3366,4.567880794701987

Forget teenagers with attitude, this show is about 5 (eventually 6) ancient warriors battling an evil witch to save our planet. Remember Rita, that sassy evil lady who hated the Power Rangers? Here, she is named Bandora and she's so evil she actually sacrifices children as her eyes bleed to summon Satan. Remeber Zordon? Alpha 5? Ernie? Forget them! There is no time for those guys! The Zyurangers are saving children and families from evil monsters left and right. No one just looses powers here and gets a new suit. The only way to loose your powers here is if you die. There aren't any zords in this show either. This show has gaint robotic dinosaur GODS! Seriously, do yourself a favor and pick this up.

6791456,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I grew up with Power Rangers for the first six years before forgetting about the series existence for 14. It was Power Rangers 20th anniversary sets on amazon that reminded me of the show and becoming a huge fan of the franchise once again. It wasn't until then around 2012 that I found out that Power Rangers actually used fight footage from a Japanese show called Super Sentai that apparently has been running since the 1970's. I did catch the first six episodes on youtube but did stop watching it since I had found out that Zyuranger was coming on DVD. But my order came in today and I have to say it is really really good! The stories are more structured with a lot more emotional driven characters including with Witch Bandora whom in Power Rangers as Rita Repulsa had little to no back story at all. Here her actions are based off of loss (won't give it away). The dangers are more extreme, the action is longer, the opening and ending themes are very bittersweet and always worth spending time listening too. I say give this show a try. If you love Power Rangers it's good to see what was put in and not for the American adaption while also maintaining a different story line.",1425081600,6,1184,4.460829493087558

The obvious explanation is that a lot of the battle footage from this series was adapted into Power Rangers. I was curious what the original source material was like, and I actually enjoyed it more than I did MMPR. I may never watch Power Rangers again.

6791468,3,B00P9UVC0I,"I am a big Power Ranger fan and was happy to hear that the Super Sentai series was being released in the USA. I received the product on 2/21/14 in excellent condition. The picture quality and sound are phenomenal! The only reason I cannot give this product a 5 star rating is that the product description is misleading. I was expecting this to be in English as it says on the site, however, it is in Japanese with English subtitles. I thought I may have received the incorrect product but a quick search of Shout! factories website shows this is only produced like this. I will be keeping the product as I am a fan, but I am disappointed in Amazon for providing a misleading description.",1424563200,,687,4.4603174603174605
6791469,5,B00P9UVC0I,I love this I what watch half of it already. I hope shout releases the rest of of the Super Sentai Series. I will promous that I won't download episodes anymore if they release them.,1424563200,18,182,4.228571428571429

6791471,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I've never been a Power Rangers fan as an adult, but I've been watching through these DVDs this last week and love it. The Japanese version of this show is much better than what it became in America. It's incredibly silly, but it's done in such an earnest way, you can't not love it.
Good quality transfer, good subtitles (although some things they say don't have a good literal translation) and just a fun action/sci fi/fantasy show. My only issue with this DVD set is that there is only one special feature, which is something compared to other Japanese shows SHOUT! Factory has released.",1424476800,5,590,4.6826923076923075
6791472,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I am so excited that I own my first Super Sentai series on DVD. This is a great idea and I really do hope they produce more of these. The DVDs are a nice quality, the story is far better than that of MMPR. The one gripe I have is the title of the DVD package. It's not Super Sentai Zyuranger it's Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger. Super Sentai is the genre.",1424390400,,348,3.9857142857142858
6791473,4,B00P9UVC0I,"As a person that grew up with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers I've always wanted to see the original Sentai series that was behind the Morphinominal show. I want to have a collected set instead of going to fan translations to get them because I want to give Toei my money. I can't import them because the Japanese DVD industry treats their products differently than we do here in the west. In fact it showed me not to take the pricing we have here for granted. The episodes themselves are in high DVD quality. Unfortunately there are only Sub English and Japanese audio language only, which doesn't bother me at all. If you were expecting a dub of the entire series your out of luck here, but who knows if they release these on blu-ray Shout! may look into that. I want to thank whoever in Shout! factory for even suggesting a release of Zyuranger. I want to thank Shout! factory for giving me an official release of Zyuranger in which I don't have to jump through hoops importing  or result in the ""other"" alternative way of getting zyuranger. I want to support Shout! to continue releasing more Super Sentai series state side and hopefully get Masked Rider Black and Black RX . I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to get into Sentai heroes.
I also would like to see:
AkibaRanger
Jetman
Gokaiger
Ohranger
Carranger
Go Go V
Hurricanger
Juukou B-Fighter & B-Fighter Kabuto.",1424390400,4,1377,4.6204081632653065

6791475,5,B00P9UVC0I,Great to finally get a sentai in America. Zyuranger is a great sentai and definitly deserves a buy for sentai fans of power rangers fans. Hoping it sells well so we can get other sentais and maybe some other series like Kamen rider,1424390400,3,231,4.395348837209302

6791486,5,B00P9UVC0I,"I watched MMPR, had no clue, only from hearing it was pieced together from a Japanese series, so thought 'ok, I'd like to see the 'real' version so to speak. (This was way before the 'net was what it is now.) I only discovered sentai two years ago, watched Zyuranger, and the difference is SO amazing! This series is great, as are the others (Jetman, Liveman, Bioman..) I've seen.

If you're a fan of MMPR, BUY this dvd! If so, then Shout! will hopefully license and get the other sentai series out to the US fans!",1417737600,2,514,4.354166666666667

6791488,5,B00P9UVC0I,"For anyone who don't know, this is the inspiration for the original power rangers series that started in 1993, which is a long running children series called super sentai.

Super sentai originally started in Japan back in 1977 i believe with the first season called go ranger. I was 11 when power rangers first began here in north America and fell in love instantly. But the stories and characters are usually more mature and thought out than our American versions.

Now 32, I'm very excited at the prospect of seeing the entire series of the Japanese original and hoping that with enough of our support, we'll see more and more classic sentai seasons released. I'm personally hoping for turboranger, maskman, abaranger and megaranger.",1416182400,,735,4.967479674796748

I'm hoping this sells well so we can get more Super Sentai and Tokusatsu releases.  I recommend this to any Power Rangers fan and any fan of the genre.,1416182400,,428,4.246913580246914

( whatever the rest of the title is ) and something Sentai Liveman . But will we really get those three seasons from Jason on DVD and Blue Ray Disc with english speaking translations ?

8687138,1,B00P9UVC0I,I hate SHOUT Factory for releasing Super Sentai.... They cost way too much and on top of that the subs are not even good even with their Color and Placement. It feels like they literal translate and not even use colloquialisms. Also it feels like it was put through Google translate. I would not support something that is poorly translated and not done properly. I have seen better subs from Fan subs than this. #SorryNotSorry If they took the time and used better subbers then I would have said it was worth it but....,1524960000,,519,4.531914893617022

8687142,5,B00P9UVC0I,"What a Great Series! I must admit, I have only ever seen a few episodes of the Power Rangers. I was in my early twenties when they first aired and had more important things on my mind like girls and cars. Until the release of this box set I had no idea it was a Japanese series before being transformed into the Power Rangers. As with most stuff of this nature, I think the original is better than the changed version. I do realize that some of the stuff in the original series would never fly on American TV and not everybody likes to read subtitles, But it represents what the actual series is really about. If I were to describe the series, It's like a cross between Ultraman and Voltron. The only downfall to this series and the Ultraman series is that you really start to like the characters and the next season is whole new story with all new characters. But that also can keep the series from getting stale. At this time I'm currently watching the fourth Super Sentai box set and I love them. I'm glad that they are selling well enough to warrant them putting more out on DVD. I just wish they would put some of the older ones on DVD, But I know they probably won't because they weren't turned into a Power Rangers series. Hope this helped.",1518307200,,1247,4.31063829787234
