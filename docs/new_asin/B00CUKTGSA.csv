5742083,5,B00CUKTGSA,"Jack Benny is the greatest and most groundbreaking comedian certain readers have most likely never heard of. for instance, take his act for vaudeville. at the time (the 1910s and 1920s), a comedy performance was generally considered to be pratfalls, pies in the face, that sort of thing. at some point Jack got the idea to simply speak to the audience, and thus did he effectively invented stand-up comedy.
similarly, on radio in the '30s and '40s, Benny more than anyone else laid the groundwork for what would be known as the sitcom, and his series has been rewarded with a title of Greatest Old-Time Radio Comedy that still stands to this day.
radio (and, to a lesser extent, television) was Jack's true forte. his work in movies was nowhere hear as fullfulling. of the nearly 30 films he starred in, he would personally recommend only three, and was completely satisfied with only one of those.
as you might imagine from the title, Benny plays an actor. this neatly dovetails with one of his radio running-gags: a paragon of pomposity, Benny's radio counterpart considered himself a better actor than he in fact was, and he'd always get sulky when Acadamy Awards time rolled around.
the mastperiece of director Ernst Lubitch, this 1942 release tells the story of a Polish theatrical troupe who fight back when the Nazis invade in 1939. not that they defeat the Nazis, mind you. even if it could be rendered believeable that mere actors had manage to topple Der Furer himself, he'd of just turned up in the newspaper again the next morning. (this would've been particularly surreal given that the film was set three years in the past.) so they content themselves with foiling a plot to destroy the Polish Resistance, then getting the hell out of Nazi territory.
Jack's leading lady is the impeccable Carole Lombard. she's been called the first great comedic actress of the ""talkies,"" and you'll get no argument from anyone who sees this film. she effortlessly exudes charm and pathos as well as her trademark humor in the roll of Jack's mostly devoted actress wife. ""mostly"" because she's not above letting herself be fawned over by a young admirer (a barely recognizable Robert Stack, looking more Dobie Gillis than Elliott Ness). Ms. Lombard is also, for all intents and purposes, the driving force of the film. it is her and her young friend, who turns out to be a pilot with the Polish army, who begin to suspect that a trusted ally may be a Nazi agent.
the humor here is not simply about Jack's pomosity. there's roughly equal parts political satire and intrigue. there's a certain poignancy to what Warsaw is reduced to over the course the film. an early scene depicts rehearsing actors reciting Shakespeare: ""if you prick us, do we not bleed?"" his repeat of the same line later, when Warsaw is officially ""occupied,"" serves as as forceful an answer as the question will ever get.
simply put, everything about TO BE OR NOT TO BE works. it effortlessly walks the fine line between humorous comedy and suspenseful tension. it's should've been a spectacular hit, a shot in the arm to a nation (if not world) which was finally officially preparing for war. not only that, but it should've been a significant turning point in the career of Jack Benny, proof positive once and for all that, wonderful as Jack Benny's radio program was, it was hardly all he could do.
but alas, the film was tainted by tragedy less than a week before it's release, when Carole Lombard died in a plane crash. the irony, of course, is that the time would come when the death of a star, particularly with a new release on the way, is practically a Christmas present to the marketing department, because they can use it to drum up residual enthusiasm for past triumphs as well as curiosity about said new release. sometimes it even kicks off a mini-industry: teen angst posterboy James Dean, sex kitten Marilyn Monroe, martial arts innovator Bruce Lee, and Beatles founder John Lennon are only a few of the luminaries to come of whom it will be said, only half jokingly, that dying was the smartest career move they ever made. even Jack Benny got to reap a bit of that harvest, because his 1974 death coincided with a thriving new interest in the radio dramas of old.
but alas, in a world that doesn't see it quite like that just yet, Ms. Lombard's death can only stigmatize the film. many who might otherwise of seen TO BE OR NOT TO BE now found it's very existance a bit disconcerting if not downright eerie. those who did chance to see the film at the time tended to describe it as bittersweet at best.
there are those historians who argue that what really tarnished the film is that dark comedy wasn't quite mainstream, and that aiming it directly at as a definite an evil as Hitler was going overboard. well, if i know anything about human nature, that's the sort of controversy that can only provoke public interest. that part might've gotten the prudes up in arms, but the outcome of that would simply be to get the film picketted. it took the Lombard tragedy to actually hurt the film.
but fortunately, any stigma has long since faded. like CITIZEN KANE or The Marx Brothers' DUCK SOUP. the one film Jack Benny was actually proud of would receive a second chance when rediscovered by the televisions generation 20 years or so down the line. it's stature has held firm ever since, and you'll see why.

[WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! the film was remade in the early '80s, and like most remakes, all it really manages to do is fall flat on it's ass. what's especially dreary about this one, however, is that it is the work of another of my comedy heroes, Mel Brooks. if anyone should've know better, it's the genius behind BLAZING SADDLES and SPACEBALLS.
so, as with roughly 98% of all film remakes, this is a case of Stick With The Original.]

P.S.: I almost forgot, the other two films Jack felt were ""okay"" or ""pretty good"" are BUCK BENNY RIDES AGAIN and GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE.",1371340800,43,5971,4.67490494296578

5742086,5,B00CUKTGSA,"This is the original version of To be or Not to Be, and came out in 1942, during WWII.  It was one of the first films to poke fun at Hitler. Jack Benny is Joshua Tura, an actor who thinks he is good at Shakespeare.  Set in Poland, 1939, just before Germany invades.  Carol Lombard, in her last film, is great as Maria Tura, Benny's wife, who likes to flirt with men.  The plot involves trying to stop a a German spy for taking sensitive to the Nazi's in Warsaw, Benny must impersonate a Nazi, and comedy follows.  Robert Stack is great as Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski, the officer sent to stop the spy. This is a fun movie and I enjoyed it very much.  I also own the Mel Brooks version of this story and both are worth watching.  Each movie has it's strong points.

5742104,5,B00CUKTGSA,"TO BE OR NOT TO BE. 1942. This classic Ernst Lubitsch  screwball comedy bravely goes where few Hollywood films have gone before or since, as it manages to wring laughs from its own contentious time and place in history, World War II. In this all-star black and white war/comedy/romance, largely set in Nazi- occupied Warsaw, Poland, Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) leads a ragtag band of actors  who come to the aid of Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski, a Polish pilot (Robert Stack) who needs help in shielding the Resistance from a German spy he has uncovered. But it turns out that Tura's beauteous wife Maria (Carole Lombard) has been flirting with the military man, which severely limits Tura's sympathies for the airman.

MGM's casting of Jack Benny, (THE JACK BENNY SHOW), in the lead role was inspired; he was much better known for his radio comedy work than his movie work at the time, but his presence sure did help to put bottoms in the theater seats.  (Mind you, the film was going into production at the beginning of America's involvement in WWII; the production was so controversial that it was necessary to raise money outside the studio system to get the film made.)  The incandescently beautiful but down-to-earth comedic actress Carole  Lombard, (MY MAN GODFREY, NOTHING SACRED) was here making her last picture, unfortunately, although, as is nice, her last work was her best, expressing  many facets of her abilities.  She was soon to die, a hugely talented young woman, in an air crash coming home from her efforts to sell Americans war bonds: Hollywood rightly considers her its First World War II casualty.  The picture also introduced a previously-unknown side - his comic abilities-- of Stack, (THE UNTOUCHABLES, AIRPLANE) to film audiences.  The multi-talented refugee from Nazi Germany, Sig Ruman (STALAG 17, NINOTCHKA), here plays the German occupying Col. Ehrhardt for both drama and laughs, hardly an easy assignment.  Lombard's elegantly minimalist gowns were by Irene.

Lubitsch, a refugee from Nazi Germany himself, was, of course, famed for his lighter than light, elegantly risqu&eacute; touch.  In his prolific career, which was unfortunately cut short by an early death, he gave us TROUBLE IN PARADISE, NINOTCHKA, CLUNY BROWN, THE LITTLE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER and many more delicious films.  TO BE is chockfull of Lubitsch touches, as they are known.  The director here somehow manages to  balance political satire, romance, slapstick, and wartime suspense in an accomplishment that has never been equaled, certainly not by the 40 years later Mel Brooks/Anne Bancroft version which largely relies on slapstick.  Lubitsch also, as I have been discovering as I rediscover his films, here continues to express his classic Central European, or, as the Germans would have it, Mittel Europa outlook.  This film is based on a story by the Hungarian Melchior Lengyel, (NINOTCHKA, SILK STOCKINGS).  It was produced by the Hungarian Sir Alexander Korda, with stunning production design by his brother Vincent Korda.  Which reminds me, there used to be a sign in the MGM commissary that read ""It is not enough to be Hungarian.  You must also work.""  Lubitsch surely did work himself; he also had a knack for getting the best work out of the best talent, before and behind the camera.  He's had followers but none are his equal.  A must-see.",1404777600,2,3352,5.0417422867513615
5742105,5,B00CUKTGSA,"Buy This Movie! Carole Lombard died 2 months before it opened, making this her last (and best) film. I loved her in ""My Man Godfrey"" with William Powell, but this film is incredible. Jack Benny young - sort-of, as he was born in 1894! He was fabulous, she was gorgeous, both were brilliant. This multi-layered, comical farce was made in 1942, during the war, and is full of comedy and satire. We decided to watch this based solely on the cast, and it turned out to be riveting, brilliant, erudite, and entertaining as well. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!

What if I told you that a movie exists that:

(1) pits Jack Benny against the Nazis
(2) is a farce set in occupied Warsaw, Poland
(3) has jokes about concentration camps
(4) has the Gestapo itself foiled by an elegant web of implausibility

Yes, such a movie DOES exist.  And this is it!!

In this American black comedy set in occupied Poland, the oddly matched Jack Benny (1894 to 1974) and Carole Lombard (1908 to 1942, her last film role) play Joseph Tura (the ""world's greatest Shakespearean actor"")  and his wife, Maria.  Furious at the Nazis for invading Poland and thus ruining his career, Tura takes revenge by turning his acting troupe into spies and his dramatic gifts into espionage.

Every scene Jack Benny appears in is comical.  In my opinion, the funniest part of the movie is Benny's classic glare when he observes an audience member (a young Robert Stack, 1919 to 2003) sneaking out in the middle of what he considers his greatest scene.  (This occurs several times.)

This movie manages successfully to balance political satire, romance, slapstick, and wartime suspense.  In other words this is a well-crafted complex satire that's also a screwball masterpiece.

The title refers to the famous ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy (speech a character gives when alone) in William Shakespeare's tragic play ""Hamlet.""

At the time this movie was released, it was not well-received by the public, many of whom couldn't understand the notion of making fun out of such a real threat as the Nazis.  Since then, it has become a comedy classic.

This movie has been digitally restored.  It probably looks better than when it was originally released!!

This movie was selected in 1996 for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

Finally, the DVD set (Criterion Collection, released in 2013) has a second disc full of interesting extras.  Also, a booklet is included that contains yet more interesting material.

In conclusion, this is a rare movie that interweaves farce and disaster and does justice to Jack Benny's comedic brilliance.

5742117,5,B00CUKTGSA,"Every once in a while you learn about a movie that you never knew existed, that you can't believe you never knew existed. ""To Be Or Not To Be"" is one of those movies.

A film produced by a Jewish director (Ernst Lubitsch) making fun of Nazi's in 1941 was a risk on a variety of levels, and although it met with much critical (and political) condemnation it stayed in the minds of all the right people, with Mel Brooks more comedic remake and later frequent tips of the hat by Quentin Tarantino/The Weinstein Company in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglourious-Basterds-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B0068FYZ3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglourious Basterds (Blu-ray + DVD)</a>.  Being Jewish and making a pseudo comedy about Hitler carries a certain degree of satisfaction, but for Lubitsch it was personal. Indeed, Lubitsch's face had been used in an early Nazi propaganda film and Hitler used him as an example of supposed corrupt influences within Europe that needed to be stamped out.

Although we would probably call it a black comedy today, Lubitsch himself described TBONTB as a ""tragical farce or a farcial tragedy"". The film is certainly funny in parts, excellent really, but frequently enough in an understated manner that for me at least seemed more drama than comedy.  That is not a criticism by any means, but for anyone thinking this will be a ""Mel Brooks"" type of funny it simply won't be.  It is pretty unique, which is pretty rare indeed.  If you like intelligent comedy that relies on context and wordplay you won't be disappointed.

Carole Lombard and Jack Benny are superb and on top of their game here, and the film transfer is excellent.  Even if you have never heard of Lubitsch but are Benny or Lombard fans you will like this movie. The many Criterion DVD bonus features can be hit or miss, but with so many, and a great 25 page booklet, it is hard to feel nothing but satisfied with the extras. A 1916 silent film directed by and starring Lubitsch is the best of the bunch (and hard to believe it is almost 100 years old). With Lubitsch himself passing away in 1947, and Lombard dieing in a plane crash before the movie was even released, we are truly lucky that this historically important film even got made in the first place.",1388102400,9,2287,4.9375

5742119,5,B00CUKTGSA,"Everything came together in this superbly nuanced 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy filmed in '41 and set in 1939 Warsaw (Poland), except for the timing of its initial release.  Between the completion of filming and the film's premiere the U.S. was attacked and brought into the world war; and the film's charismatic female star, Carole Lombard, who gave her finest screen performance here (completely commanding in her comedy and her alluring, enigmatic sexiness), was killed in a plane crash returning home from a war bond rally.  With two major comedy-squelching strikes against it, the film was nearly defeated altogether by blasts from short-sighted critics who claimed to be offended by any number of superficial elements (as well as the subject matter itself: farcical satire of Nazis in a defeated and occupied European country), while making no real effort to understand it on a deeper and more subtle level.  This was Lubitsch's best film in virtually every aspect of its production, especially its meticulously worked-out story and screenplay in collaboration with the Hungarian and American dramatists Melchior Lengyel and Edwin Justus Mayer, respectively.

The term ""theater of war"" applies literally to this film, as a troupe of Warsaw stage actors led by husband-and-wife stars Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny and Carole Lombard) cleverly and courageously perform a mission involving a series of risky off-stage performances, with some tricky impersonations, to take down a respected professor operating as a high-level spy and informer for the Nazis.  The film is often suspenseful, ironically heightening the impact of the comedy, both in its hilarious running verbal and sight gags and sudden comic surprises.  Benny is right there comedically with Lombard, absolutely at the top of his game, and is the only performer in radio, TV or film history who could have pulled off the ingenious, tailor-made (Lubitsch was the son of a tailor in Germany) final scene to perfection.

There are a number of remarkable supporting performances, featuring several by Lubitsch film veterans: Sig Ruman's Colonel Ehrhardt set the comic template for the overweight, minimally competent, buffoonish yes-man (or ""Heil""-man) German officer still seen two decades later in watered-down form on ""Hogan's Heroes"";  Felix Bressart's Greenberg provides a moving Jewish perspective; and Tom Dugan as the troupe's faux-Hitler delivers two of the funniest lines in the film. Stanley Ridges nails his villainous role of Professor Siletsky, who subverts his intellectualism to fit Nazi ideology (which is truly frightening).  Robert Stack, 17 years before becoming TV's Eliot Ness, plays the heroic young military pilot, who although he is on Joseph Tura (Benny)'s side patriotically, is a thorn in his side due to his romantic obsession with his wife.  (Stack is a bit too stiff to be convincing, so it's Benny's exasperated reactions to him that have to be relied upon to derive comedy from this character.)

Both the black-and-white picture transfer (kept in the original aspect ratio of 137:1) and the sound remastering (24-bit) are top-notch.  There is a new audio commentary by film historian David Kalat who loves this film and knows everything about it.  Disc Two contains a 53-minute 2010 scholarly French documentary on Lubitsch's film career.  The clips are good, but attention, TALKING HEADS ALERT!  There is also the 45-minute 1916 silent film comedy, ""Pinkus's Shoe Palace,"" which Lubitsch directed and starred in, playing the Jewish title character who goes from academic failure to rising to the top of the shoe-biz ladder.  And finally we get to hear a couple of half-hour radio plays from 1940 and 1943.  The first features Jack Benny, Claudette Colbert, Basil Rathbone and Lubitsch as themselves in an extended one-joke routine about Benny's prodigious ego being deflated as he tries to talk his way into a starring screen role.  The second is an adaptation of ""To Be Or Not to Be"" starring real-life husband and wife William Powell and Diana Lewis as the Turas, with Sig Ruman reprising his Colonel Ehrhardt.  After viewing the film this reduction for radio feels like a perfunctory and hollow exercise (although Ruman still has his same impeccable comic delivery).

The 28-page accompanying photographically illustrated booklet contains an informative essay on the film, as well as an intriguing Ernst Lubitsch NY Times op-ed defending ""To Be Or Not to Be.""",1385337600,3,4462,5.27542372881356
5742120,5,B00CUKTGSA,"To Be or Not To Be (from the Criterion Collection) is an outstanding black comedy that works on every level; I have rarely watched a film with this much humor and action combined. The script was very well written and the casting couldn't have been better. If poor Carole Lombard had to die such an untimely death, at least she completed this film before she died. The cinematography and the choreography shine and the acting is very convincing as well. If I sound like I'm gushing about this it's because I was thrilled with this picture and it will remain in my collection for years to come.

When the action starts, we see a Polish local theater company preparing for their opening night of a play critical of Hitler and Nazism. Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his wife Maria (Carole Lombard) star in the show; but we meet other actors in the troop including Bronski who is playing Hitler; Greenberg who complains that he's only cast as an extra; producer Dobosh (Charles Halton) and more. However, at the last minute a government minister comes to tell them that they cannot put on the play because it might offend Hitler--so they hastily prepare for Hamlet with Joseph playing the role of Hamlet.

Unfortunately, there's even more trouble than the impending Nazi invasion of Poland. Maria, Joseph's wife, Maria, has been getting flowers from an admirer who turns out to be Polish Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Moreover, a trusted and esteemed Polish professor by the name of Siletsky goes on a secret mission for Poland and gets the names of the families who are in the Polish resistance movement--only it turns out that Siletsky is actually working for the Nazis as a spy and he wants to turn over the names of the resistance fighters and their families to the Gestapo.

I don't want to spoil too much of this for you; suffice it to say that there are many quick plot twists that make for a whopper of a movie with action, suspense and some really good laughs. Look also for a great performance by Sig Ruman as Nazi Captain Ehrhardt; In addition, the second DVD comes with some outstanding extras; I particularly enjoyed film historian David Kalats audio commentary; the French documentary entitled Lubitsch le patron; the booklet with that wonderful essay by Geoffrey O'Brien and the newer, restored digital print is very good.

To Be or Not To Be rightfully deserves its place as one of the funniest films ever according to The American Film Institute. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys black comedy; and fans of the actors in this film will love it.",1385078400,3,2583,4.733333333333333

Jack Benny has ruined the ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy for me for ever. Every time I hear it I expect someone to rise and leave the stalls of the theatre.
A perfect example of less being more, and I'm referring to the Mel Brooks version which has vanished unmourned ( and I like Mel Brooks, by the way. And Anne Bancroft).",1384214400,,479,4.274725274725275

5742129,5,B00CUKTGSA,"I always say the 3 Godfathers of comedy are Ernst Lubitsche, Preston Sturges, and Billy Wilder. If you EVER have a chance to watch any of their films do it ASAP. This one may be my favorite Lubitsche.
When Lubitsche passed away a friend of Billy Wilder said, ""Well...no more Lubitsche"" to which the incomparable Billy Wilder responded, ""Worse...no more Lubitsche films.""",1380758400,3,370,4.983870967741935
5742130,5,B00CUKTGSA,"A film that is both comedic and suspenseful is no easy trick to pull off. Two that come to mind are FOUL PLAY and SILVER STREAK. Now we finally have this wonderful Criterion release of the classic 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy , YES - comedy!, about the Nazis occupying Warsaw, Poland and a small troupe of Polish actors who help to sabotage their invaders. This story isn't played for total laughs, and there are plenty of suspenseful moments, which makes this film so incredibly great. Interesting to note, that when this film was released in 1942, in the thick of the war, it was generally panned and criticized. Even Jack Benny's father walked out on the initial screening-mortified that his son would appear in a Nazi uniform. (Benny later changed his father's mind, And the man ended up loving it and seeing it 46 times!) The passing of time would end up finding this film generally loved and considered a comedy classic.
Interesting notes: The film was Carole Lombard's last, and was released 2 months after she died in a  plane crash.
Sig Ruman,  who plays Col. Ehrhardt, would go on to play the original ""Sgt. Schultz"" in Billy Wiler's STALAG 17.
Look for an early role by Robert ""Elliot Ness"" Stack as the Polish pilot who has a crush on Carole Lombard's character.

It's funny, because if you've ever watched the Jack Benny show, every now and then somebody will remark on a  film he made - THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT - as ""THE ONE"" film he made, and never lived it down. I realize it was played for comedic effect, but he certainly had nothing to be ashamed of his Tour-de- force role in this  excellent film!",1377734400,14,1618,4.56551724137931
5742131,5,B00CUKTGSA,"Carole Lombard, Jack Benny and director Ernst Lubitsch were comic geniuses, and all three were at the top of their form when they made TO BE OR NOT TO BE (1942), arguably one of the funniest movies of all time.  The film has now been restored in a new 2K digital transfer from The Criterion Collection.

This black farce cast Benny, who never gave a more hilarious performance [Imagine him playing Hamlet and you'll get the idea.], and Lombard as a theatrical couple living in occupied Poland.  With the help of a young Polish flier (Robert Stack) and their acting company, the pair is able to neutralize a Nazi spy, and then narrowly escape to England.

A simple plot, true, but it's how these performers go about accomplishing their task that has kept audiences laughing these many years...even when most movies about the Nazis were no longer funny.

This, incidentally, was Lombard's final movie.

Extras in this 2-disc set include audio commentary by film historian David Kalat,  PINKUS' SHOW PALACE,  a 1916 German silent short, directed by and starring Lubitsch,  a 2010 French documentary on the director's career,  plus two episodes of the radio anthology, ""The Screen Guild Theatre"": VARIETY with Jack Benny, Claudette Colbert and Lubitsch, and an adaptation of TO BE OR NOT TO BE with William Powell, Diana Lewis and Sig Ruman.  The package also contains a Criterion booklet with an essay by critic Geoffrey O'Brien and a 1942 New York Times op-ed by Lubitsch.

5742132,5,B00CUKTGSA,"I hope this Blu Ray lives up to its potential, but I have ordered it regardless.
Here is the greatest psychological moment in cinema history (sez me).
spoiler alert.  (You wouldn't have noticed it anyway, probably.)
It is 1939, just before Hitler's invasion of Poland.  The scene is Warsaw. The movie was made in 1941, after the conquest of Poland and France, before America entered the War in December.  Can you imagine a comedy about America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, while W was still our prezydent??
The opening titles play in front of the Heroic Polonaise of Chopin.  Anyone who does not feel like bursting into tears doesn't know history.
Jack and Carole are a husband and wife stage acting team in Warsaw, like Hugh Cronin and Jessica Tandy, or Brad Pitt and whatser name.  Jack's wife Carole Lombard is flirting with a stage door admirer, a naive young pilot in the Polish Air Force, played by Robert Stack.  She invites him to leave the audience and come backstage when her husband playing Hamlet goes, To Be or Not To Be -- what could be more wounding to her vain, infantile hubby, who cannot but see the lad's walk-out?  Stack rises to the Oedipal bait, and after a few visits just as he is putting serious moves on Lombard, her dressing room door bursts open, and a maid announces Hitler has invaded Poland, Sept 1, 1939.  Stack the pilot has to leave to go to war to defend Poland, and grow up in a hurry.
The amazing piece of psychology is that it is a RELIEF!!!  Thank god, WWII happened just in time to prevent this illicit, quasi-incestuous hook-up from happening.  Using my psychiatric license to dispense opinions, I offer the idea that it makes sense that War resolves certain emotional conflicts.  Why else would we send our sons and daughters to die in war, and why else would they agree to go?",1375142400,4,1822,4.592592592592593
5742133,4,B00CUKTGSA,"This original Fritz Lubitsch satire on Hitlerism no doubt inspired many followers including Mel Brooks, but Brooks' treatment of this same material lacks the Lubitsch touch, indeed.  Probably Jack Benny's best film work--in which he doesn't play himself--is perfectly complementary to the incomparable Carole Lombard  (in what I believe was her last film).  One of Lubitsch's "" touch"" moves is his use of ensemble players and his ability to integrate a Benny or Lombard into the troupe (exception may be the wooden Robert Stack who in his early movies always seems to be auditioning to be Eliot Ness, but he serves as a perfect foil here).  Anyone who has seen Brooks' ham-handed take will benefit greatly from this deft version.

Brooks does much better in his original satiric attack on Hitlerism in ""The Producers"" (film and stage versions) than he does in his remake of this film, which depends on someone else's comic vision.",1371600000,14,930,5.012987012987013

8586616,5,B00CUKTGSA,"This Ernst Lubitsch movie from 1942 must be one of the best comedies ever made period. I can't say for sure, since I have not seen all comedies. It's a dark comedy with a dramatic WW II story underlying it. Saw it yesterday on the big screen in original 35 mm projection, and somehow it felt like I was seeing the movie for the first time. It's amazing how a 2017 audience still can laugh hard at jokes that were written 75 years ago. The sharp acerbic wit did apparently not always go down well shortly after release, and the movie was often panned as tasteless. This DVD has a beautiful restoration of this important and very entertaining movie and also has a very interesting commentary track, as well as an interesting French documentary consisting  mainly of talking heads pontificating about the the Lubitsch Touch (whatever that may be). If you like great comedy, go see! And while you're at it, see all of Ernst Lubitsch's movies, the master of sophisticated comedies.",1498348800,2,976,4.674418604651163
