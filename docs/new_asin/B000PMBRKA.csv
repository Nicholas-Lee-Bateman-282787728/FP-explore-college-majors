8192373,5,B000PMBRKA,"As usual, Dr. Greenberg has put together an interesting, engaging and fun look at the world of Opera. He helps us to appreciate the role that the genere played in European society and culture. His exciting interpretation and opinions add to the listeners enjoyment. He fulfills his promise to the listener for us to better understand the great achievements of the composers and writers of the stories and musical framework. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am going to listen to it again soon. Well done.",1346889600,,499,4.882352941176471
8192374,2,B000PMBRKA,"This series features Professor Greenburg's exploration into the world of opera.  It would be a great idea, if it weren't for the fact that most of it consists of Professor Greenburg's conjecture.  He dwells on Primitive music for far too long than is relevant for Opera.  And he is quite the opinionated Professor with his ideas such as ""the composer as dramatist"" not the performer.  And so forth.  Every so often, he gets into the history and facts that make Opera interesting.  But for far too much of time, he simply conjectures and I found myself disagreeing with most of his conjectures. Even though, I'm an admirer of Opera.",1252368000,3,631,4.743119266055046
