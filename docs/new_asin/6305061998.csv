For an independant film, they achieve the subliminal message they were trying to send to us. I love the comradirie between the six friends. I even like Grizz, the evil one. Here's my breakdown of the characters (without fully giving away the story)

Ed- The boisterous voice(on the AM) calling from jail.

Hope- He's the shorty who lost his entire family due to violence from the Mandela Street Gangs.

Cairo- He is the working stiff who is very self-righteous at times, but he still has mad love for his friends. He wants to change and escape life on the streets

Herb- Gosh, he was my favorite. The good-looking ,lanky brother with the cutest smile I ever seen. He has dreams of his own of making it to pro basketball. He's enjoying a month away from school. His main objective is to smoke blunts, watch and tape videos, and talk to his idiotic girlfriend Terri.

Dee- is the goofy ass girl/sidekick who likes Cairo. She is wholly self-righteous. She knew what type of guys she was hanging out with. She annoyed me, most of the time. She works with Cairo and I think she liked him more than she let on. She served no real purpose ,except being the sidekick with breasts and a big mouth.

Ren- Skinny little comedian who was Grizz's partner in the drug game. He had me tripping most of the time. I like the facial expressions. He's the class clown

""Grizz""- He is the truth. The ultimate nightmare to the shallow fantasy the friends had build around themselves. He pulled no punches and that brutal honesty is what made him one of my favorite characters. The real paradox here is that Grizz was the best friend that Hope could ever have. He debted the situation before he (Hope) could wake up the next morning.

 In conclusion, this story is a paradox and it was a treat to watch friends banter while taking in good green.

On the flipside, the overall message is that violence has become too much to bear. And like those under pressure, they begin to crumble.",1105315200,,2003,4.520775623268698
