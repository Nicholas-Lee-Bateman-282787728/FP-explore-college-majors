8550542,4,B00AEGQFKO,"While this is not some 'stirring' Hollywood movie, it is a really thorough look at one of the few rail lines thru the Continental Divide.  It starts where the rails go across the North end of Lake Pend O'reille (Ponderay) before entering Montana and works back down to Spokane in sections, explaining the rebuilding that took place over the decades since the Line was developed in the late 1800's. It was/is one of the few lines currently in use thru the Rockies with the next being just above Salt Lake City.  The Funnel has become the nickname of how other lines funneled across the Northwest from the Pacific to the Minneapolis region on this single line.

This is a ""must see"" for Railroad Fans and is well done in color and sunsets along with the sounds of moving freight wheels on rails.  Features many locomotives and an array of other rolling stock.",1386028800,,857,4.618421052631579
