8536704,5,B0096KHX1E,"I really liked this video of Deidamia.  It is full of catchy tunes and the sets and costumes look bright and colorful.  The orchestra and singing is fine.  I especially enjoyed Sally Matthews in the title roll.

There are not many recordings of Deidamia and this is the only available video.  All Handel fans need to have this in their collection.

If you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version looks and sounds great and it is cheaper than the DVD.",1485216000,,453,4.530864197530864

8536706,1,B0096KHX1E,"A Eurotrash director. We found it unwatchable. And the singing wasn't that great, either, so we didn't feel like turning off the picture and just listening.
I enjoy most productions of Handel operas when they take the plot and give it a twist, but keep a fairly logical story to go with it.  (I really enjoyed the Glyndebourne Rinaldo where Rinaldo is a bullied,daydreaming boy in a boys school.)",1480982400,,396,4.739130434782608
8536707,4,B0096KHX1E,"In contrast to the previous reviewer, I thought the staging for this opera was excellent.  It was imaginitive, and at times, humorous.  For example, right at the beginning, Ulysses arrives in a submarine.  Now some may claim, rightly, that this is unrealistic, and, of course it has nothing to do with the story, but when the story is from obsure Greek legend, who really cares.  Viewers and reviewers really need to lighten up on this point.

I think the set and costume designs were great, as was the choreography.  The acting was also brillaint.

Where I do agree with the previous reviewer, is in his criticism of the singing which, as so often happens, was spoiled by excessive vibrato, especially from the ladies.  I would have given this production 5 stars, had there been slightly less warble.  The men were better in this regard, especially Umberto Chiummo who gave a very pleasing vocal performance as Licomede.",1428105600,2,921,4.852564102564102
8536708,3,B0096KHX1E,"Although the music is wonderful Handel, as always, the production leaves a lot to be desired. If you enjoy stagings that have absolutely nothing to do with the story (or the music), then you might like this. I think the cast are confused in this production, as they never really get into the power of the music. The singing is very superficial, as if some of the singers have no idea of how to sing Handel. This is another example of European staging that puts the ideas of the director before the music or the story. The best thing I can say about this DVD is: the picture is stunning!",1386720000,,586,4.336363636363636
8536709,5,B0096KHX1E,"Here is a rare and exceptional example in which the director and costume designer amuse themselves with `silly' costumes, but it actually works. I usually loath the stupid concept of 'clever' producers' of dressing opera singers in an motley set of `modern' and bizarre costumes (mostly tasteless) to help the `stupid' spectators to understand the universality of the opera across time and place. However, in this particular production I enjoyed every moment of it. All my reservations withstanding, I found that the costumes have actually helped highlight the `buffa' aspects of this supposedly `siria' opera. This work may not be among Handel's greatest masterpieces, but the way it is presented and sung here makes it a thorough pleasure for the senses. Sally Mathews' performance is outstanding: both singing and acting are superb. Qudos also goes to Olga Pasichnyk and Silvia Tro Santafe. Ivor Bolton also did a fine job in introducing this forgotten opera to the the modern audience.",1371081600,3,989,5.226415094339623
8536710,5,B0096KHX1E,"This is a very nontraditional production set in a world of modern costumes including some remainiscent of WWII. Odd sets too. But everything works. This is a lot of fun and the singing/acting is excellent. This is definitely NOT Eurotrash. Oh! That other ""updated"" operatic productions were done this well.",1366329600,8,306,5.14
8536711,5,B0096KHX1E,"Five minutes after curtain-up I found myself laughing out loud and this was but a prelude to the inexhaustible comic touches throughout the production.  A submarine periscope moving across the stage signals we're in for loads of the unexpected.  This is not wanton goofing around.  The submarine is a frightening presence when it surfaces and it symbolizes the might of Greece.  ""Your reply is an offense to Greece.  You are protecting the Trojans"" threatens Ulysses from the conning tower.  From curtain-up to finale, all the igenious stage effects are 100% true to their mission of making Handel a success and they achieve this with marvelous flair and enthusiasm.

The presentation of Achilles is a gift from heaven.  Olga Pasichnyk conveys male adolescent hormones itching for challenges and impatient for the dominos of restraint to be scattered all over the place.  Her trampings, her gait, her overall impetuousness are entirely convincing --- this is a volcanic warrior held on a very tenuous leash who is galled by the comical female wardrobe and increasingly insupportable pretenses.

The cast is superb, except for Andrew Foster-Williams as Fenice who can't match the fast company that surrounds him.
The prior two reviewers comment on the vocals with such discernment, my comments would be redundant.  We are all enthusiastic.

There are stretches where the opera itself needs help beyond capable singing and the bold staging & high jinx give it the propulsion it needs to be a winner.  Everything is in the service of Handel and there's no self-indulgence or sensation-seeking for the wrong reasons.  It's a bouyant production bursting with vitality and the electric charge that makes us sit up and take constant notice.  And it's constantly loyal to Handel.",1365724800,2,1771,5.1649122807017545
8536712,5,B0096KHX1E,"Or the separate but related question: SHOULD Opera Seria be done seriously? It's a serious question. What's at stake is whether the Music is sufficient in itself, or whether three hours of Opera Seria must inevitably be, as Keris Nine declares, boring. Unless, that is, the listening mind is cleverly distracted from the music by zany stage business. The impresarios and stage directors of Deidamia at the Nederlandse Opera had no qualms about combining zaniness with ""historically informed"" musicianship. The zaniness isn't quite as convincing, for me at least, as the music. It's not clowning at the level of Cirque du Soleil; in fact it's rather corny stuff that draws chuckles mostly from its incongruity. The singing, on the other hand, is superb (with one slight exception) and the orchestra impeccable, causing me to wonder whether I wouldn't be just as happy with a concert performance or a set of CDs.

A lot of wit went into this staging. Ulysses arrives on the island of Scyros in a submarine. Achilles wears old-fashioned football shoulder pads to bulk out his armor. Phoenix chuffs a cigar while he tinkers with his radio. Sally Matthews, well cast both vocally and visually as the sweet toothsome virgin Deidamia, strives valiantly to convey both passion and pathos in her arias, but the effort is futile. The campy context of the staging preludes an real emotional involvement in the music.

One might wonder, I suppose, whether the audiences of Handel's London were able to thrill to the heroism of an Achilles sung soprano by a castrato. Was their reaction also a form of cognitive dissonance? Were their sensibilities so much less sardonic and skeptical than ours? Or was baroque opera always camp? The three-century popularity of Ariosto's ""Orlando Furioso"" seems to suggest that ""Early Modern"" Homo sapiens had an insatiable appetite for kitschy melodrama.

Deidamia is nobody's choice as Handel's most spectacular musical achievement. There are a couple of glorious arias -- Deidamia's nightingale aria is sheer delight -- and a couple that come close to being glorious. But why, I wonder, do I remember the somewhat childish humor and gaudy costumes more than the music? Is this the price we have to pay in order to hear Baroque opera on stage, to have the musical experience cheapened?

But don't think I'm griping! Oh no! I enjoyed my three hours thoroughly! Note my five stars, in recognition of the excellent vocal art of the whole cast, especially of Matthews, Olga Pasichnyk as Achilles and Silvia Tro Santaf as Ulysses. It was the virtuosity of the singers that drew audiences to the opera houses of the 18th C, far more than any appreciation of the dramatic texts, which they couldn't understand anyway. We have super- and sub-titles. Let's count our blessings.",1360540800,2,2791,5.008620689655173
8536713,4,B0096KHX1E,"There has been some terrific work done in recent years in terms of critical editions, in the development and playing of period instruments and through inventive stage productions, all of which have gone some way to revive even the most obscure of Handel's operas and help restore the composer's reputation to the place it deserves. There was however a reason why Baroque opera seria went out of fashion, consigning all but a few of Handel's operas to obscurity for several hundred years. They can be frightfully dull. Even Handel, towards the end of career, moved away from the overly restrictive conventions of the form in preference for the oratorio, but even his late operas show a diminishing of interest and invention. Written in 1741, Handel's last opera, Deidamia only ran for three performances and it is not the most involving work by the composer in its subject or treatment. On the other hand, it's still Handel, and with a little involvement and invention, even the driest of Handel's opera serias can be enhanced with a strong and sympathetic production.

There's a tendency to take Handel very seriously indeed, but his works are littered with comic references, the composer recognising long before Mozart that there's lots of humour to be derived from hidden identities and cross-dressing in opera plots. That's evident immediately from the moment that Deidamia, on the island of Scyros, expresses her frustration that her lover - the great hero Achilles - is unable to keep in character in his female disguise. Having been sent there by his father to hide - an oracle having warned him of Achilles fate should he join the war with Troy - Achilles is disguised as a young girl, Pyrrha. Instead of picking flowers and doing some needlework however, Achilles is unable to resist his red-blooded masculine urges and is off in the woods hunting wild animals. In David Alden's production for the De Nederlandse Opera - beautifully stylised as well as humorously inclined - Achilles (a trouser role, just to add to the confusion and humour about the nature of the character) stomps onto the stage at this moment in a frilly pink dress throwing air punches, a bloody deer carcass slung over his shoulder with what looks like a few bits chomped out of it by the Greek warrior in his predatory zeal.

Seeking the aid of Lycomedes and looking for Achilles, Ulysses however stirs up the usual romantic complications that result in anguished da capo arias - ""You are unfaithful, you do not love me"" and ""You have robbed me of my happiness"" are sentiments expressed here and there are others along the same lines. That's not to say that some of the arias aren't exquisitely beautiful - it's still Handel after all - and, to take Odysseus' 'Perdere il bene amato' as an example, capable of expressing genuine feeling and emotion, particularly when it is sung as finely as it is here by Silvia Tro Santaf. That's the great strength of Alden's production - it might look tongue-in-cheek and visually stylised with little concession to reality - but it doesn't neglect to give Handel's beautiful musical arrangements the expression they deserve, and with Ivor Bolton conducting the Concerto Kln wonderfully through this elegant score, there's not much chance of it being anything but respectful and attuned to all the colours of the work.

Colourful, elegant and beautiful in their simplicity, the sets however do reflect the nature of the three main characters. Deidamia's nature is exotic, based around a tropical island theme of Act I, the little island of Scyros an Aegean paradise surrounded by a limpid sea that reflects the sun-tinted blooms of cloud in its clear blue skies. Achilles' wild and untameable nature is reflected in the jungle of Act II, while the Greek classicism and nobility of Ulysses is the theme of the third act's developments. There's maybe nothing naturalistic about the sets or the costumes - submarines that convey the Greeks to the island where they hop off and walk along the reflective surface of the sea - but it relates to the characters well and looks simply gorgeous from whatever angle it is viewed (and it is beautifully filmed here on this BD release). There are more than enough reasons in Handel's music alone for this lesser work to be of considerable interest, but Alden's stunning sets and the stylised costumes enhance the majesty and beauty in the music even further. And the comedy.

The combination of Handel, Bolton and Alden provides good enough reason alone, but the best reason for watching this production is for the singing performances. There are a few weaker elements in the cast - Victoria Cangemi's Nerea isn't always capable of sustaining a pure line and has a tendency to come apart on the high notes, and Umberto Chiummo's Lycomedes isn't the steadiest either - but in the three main roles where it counts, the performances are utterly delightful. There are considerable singing challenges in the roles of Deidamia, Ulysses and Achilles, which are compounded by the three of them having to find a way of bringing these character's fairly rote sentiments to life and work together dramatically. Silvia Tro Santaf, I mentioned earlier brings a forcefulness of expression and depth of sentiment that is perfectly matched by beauty and lightness of Sally Matthews' nonetheless robust singing and her eye-catching performance, each of them further contrasted by Olga Pasichnyk performance of Achilles' impetuous masculine vigour and enthusiasm. Although the aria form doesn't give much of an opportunity for these characters to interact, the strength of Handel's work is in providing just such a contrast of personalities, situations and emotional tones, and this cast really makes that work in a way that is simply spellbinding.

Beautifully staged, with wonderful colour schemes and lighting, this spectacle looks outstanding in High Definition on Blu-ray, but the HD audio tracks are most impressive. There's a brightness and clarity and luxuriousness of tone in both the PCM stereo and the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes that really highlights the qualities of the period instruments in a Baroque orchestra. Directed by Ivor Bolton, the qualities of the score, the construction and rhythm of the music are all the more apparent and impressive. The BD also has an interesting 24-minute featurette that looks behind-the-scenes at the music and stage rehearsals, interviewing those involved, as well as a Cast Gallery. The booklet examines the themes in Handel's work in more depth and there's a full synopsis. The disc is all-region, BD50, Full HD, with subtitles in English, French, German and Dutch only.",1357430400,11,6663,5.026244343891403
