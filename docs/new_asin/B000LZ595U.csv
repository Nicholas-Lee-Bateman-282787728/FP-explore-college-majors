8165420,4,B000LZ595U,"This is a film about a dance troupe who are telling their stories of childhood sexual abuse through dance.  The group supports each other, and demonstrates a very innovative approach to not only breaking the silence about incest, but also healing from it.  Worth watching although the production looks more like a homemade video.  Still a brave and courageous effort to bring this very important topic into the light.
