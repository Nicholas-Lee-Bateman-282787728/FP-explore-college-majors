3499775,4,B001BXM1L6,"The vintage Can-Am video on this DVD video is superb. Amazing that it was able to be assembled. This is easily worth the price alone. However, I do not think the narration of Sam Posey and Jim Hall was well written. They never appear on camera. It is almost like they talked into a microphone in a studio somewhere reading a script written by someone who had an OK, but not great understanding of the Can-Am. Sam is such an articulate guy. He has done much better stuff than this.

But like I said, buy it for the vintage video. You will not be disappointed.

As an aside, the first thing you see is a driver enjoying a drive in what is obviously a Shelby 427 Cobra. As an owner of a Superformance Cobra, that put a smile on my face.

3499776,2,B001BXM1L6,"This DVD covers the early years fairly well, but jumps through the later years far too rapidly, and with very inadequate coverage. The DVD should have been longer, especially with more and better coverage of the 1972 and 1973 years. Overall, rather disappointing. Too bad, since this was a very special era for auto racing.

3499780,5,B001BXM1L6,"Sam Posey takes you on an adventure of the Canadian-American series know as Can-Am.
Unlimited bore engines, the first winged race cars, first ground effects, lap times better than Grand Prix cars,.. not to mention the most powerful road race car ever built...917/30KL
This is Can-Am racing

Putting it to words the memories this has brought back is impossible.

 I'm very fortunate to have grown up just outside Road America (my first race was around 1970)..its minutes from my back door.
To see Road America back in the day, without guard rails, is almost hard to believe.
All the tracks back then were raw and untamed, fitting for the Can-Am beasts.

Regardless of the type of racing that turns your crank,
Can-Am 'The Speed Odyssey' is a must have.

3499781,5,B001BXM1L6,This dvd does an excellent job of recreating the ambience of the classic late 60's/early 70's Can-Am....especially as the sounds have been sucessfully synchronized with the video imagery. Sam's narration is erudite as ever..we even get some commentary from Jim Hall. The story is told pretty straightforwardly and some tangential details have been omitted...overall a good job and it will certainly jog the memories of those who were there! We also get to lap long defunct great racetracks such as Riverside and Bridgehampton.....as close as possible to a Can-Am time machine....,1221177600,24,579,5.373626373626373

Video technology have advanced so much that at times viewing on a large HDMI tv is rather a let down. It could be improved with offering an additional disc with historical data of the different makes and models and Can-AM race results with lots and lots of good quality pictures.

Over the exciteing time of the can am it was dominated by just a few teams because they had the tech and money to prevail in a race series where no limits in power or tech.
would be a problem... hence most of the teams had limited funds and never Won.

3499797,5,B001BXM1L6,For those of us who grew up with CAN AM it is a great video.  CAN AM dragsters that steer is the subtitle.  They had big block motoers (455 CI) and movable wings.  To hear Sam Posey's voice and to see the old race drivers who drove anything with four wheels is a great tribute to their skills and desires.,1386633600,,305,4.05
3499798,4,B001BXM1L6,"Unlike some other reviewers, CAN-AM racing was before my time, and I actually didn't become a fan of auto racing until a couple years ago, when I began spending time on track myself (though I did watch the Indy 500 when I was a kid).  So this DVD didn't bring back memories for me, but I certainly enjoyed seeing the battle of drivers, cars, and teams in this relatively unrestricted, and thus often beastly, class of race cars.  The only reason I'm deducting a star is that I would have appreciated a little more depth across the board - how the top drivers were so successful, the engineering details of the cars, the features of the tracks, etc.

As a side note, it's pretty scary from today's vantage point to look back and see the lack of safety gear in these cars, despite speeds approaching 200 mph.  Some drivers had close calls and were very lucky!",1386028800,,857,4.4743589743589745

As a fan of Can-Am and Trans-Am (and Formula A) racing of the era, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much actual early series racing footage is included, By far the most spectacular revelation, to me at least, was the wonderful sounds of all the 6 and 7 liter engines at full song.

I attended races at Laguna Seca and Bridgehampton back in the day and was very pleased to see an authoritative video presentation.  If it were me, I would have broken the series down into 'pre Porsche 917' and 'post 917' and expanded coverage of both eras.  In other words, I would want more although the amount of material on film or tape may be very limited.  Interviews with the surviving drivers would also be good.

Very sad to see it close in July 1988. I feel fortunate to have followed the careers of so many of racing greats:  Dan Gurney, Phil Hill, and the development of so many excellent cars.  The only thing I would change about this DVD is - I wish it had been even longer.  It brought back many wonderful memories of some great afternoons.

Can-Am's lifespan wasn't long, but it's legacy has remained strong. The racing was incredible! The worlds best drivers, in the worlds most powerful and fastest racecars, at a time aerodynamics and ground effects were in their infancy.

If you were lucky enough to have experienced the sights and sounds of Can-Am racing as I have, you probably continue to dream of the opportunity to see these awesome cars racing once again. Sadly, the racing will never come back again for real, but this video is the next best thing.

This video does an outstanding job of explaining the history of Can-Am, and giving the viewer the feeling of having been there to witness it. You'll wish there were 3 or 4 more hours of this video to watch. I think it's pretty rare to find so much information and footage of Can-Am, certianly in one place.

3499816,5,B001BXM1L6,"The Can Am series was run in North America between 1966 and 1974.  The series was governed by the Sports Car Club of America and utilized the FIA's Group 7 rules, which basically stated the car had to have 2 seats, 4 wheels, and be clothed in body work, the rest was up to the person building it.  This format was perhaps perfectly suited for the times; as America, overall, was beginning to push technological and cultural boundries starting in the mid-60s.

Can Am cars are without doubt the most powerful cars that sports car racing has ever come to know.  Technology was advancing rapidly during this time in motor racing, largely due to these small constructors with very open minds in regards to new metals and aerodynamics.  ""Can Am The Speed Odyssey"" exhibits exceptional color footage of these road racing beasts slogging it out on the most historic tracks that North America offered at the time.

Cars like Peter Bryant's Ti22, Eric Broadly's Lolas, and Jim Hall's Chaparrel racers are seen in full color and in action, with occasional bits of footage even narrated by Jim.  The rest of the story is told by Sam Posey, a Can Am veteran among other titles, and pilot of some of the most notable cars in the series; cars like the Caldwell, the Lola T160, and the Porsche 917PA.  Sam, along with technical insight from Jim Hall, tell the story of these great cars and the men who daringly piloted them for the span of nearly a decade.

Ultimately, the Can Am came to an end in 1974, but the time that Traco V8s and Porsche turbo 12 cylinder engines thundered around the awesome tracks of North America will never be forgotten.  This video does an exceptional job of bringing to life the Can Am series in all its glory for folks like myself that were too young to remember it and have fallen in love with reading about the series over the years.

Full color footage of, in my strict opinion, the greatest time in road racing, is priceless.  This DVD is a must have for all sports car racing lovers the world over.",1263081600,2,2019,4.53168044077135
3499817,5,B001BXM1L6,"I agree with most of the other reviews here - this is easily worth the purchase just for the audio.  There is one particular sequence with a steady cam shot where you get a few of the different cars roaring past, slight variations but all enormous and powerful and each introduced by Sam Posey... they showed this bit during an F1 race last year and that alone sold me.  The other thing I really enjoyed was the movable rear wing on the Chaparral 2F, so cool seeing it dip for braking/cornering and then flatten for the straights.  Of course seeing the old tracks is great as well, and I really enjoyed the footage with Bruce McLaren and all the other greats.  I wasn't around when all this was actually happening so I am extremely grateful to have this dvd to experience it to some degree.",1252540800,4,790,4.427586206896552

opportunity for those who have only heard the stories.  As a fan of Bruce
McLaren(since 1960)in Formula 1 it was only natural that I was a devotee
of the Bruce and Denny Show(Bruce McLaren/Denny Hulme).  My review title
Orange Elephants Running Wild is a reference to the orange McLaren cars
that dominated Can-Am racing in 1968-1969-1970.  This dvd is a must see

3499821,5,B001BXM1L6,"This DVD far exceeded my expectations in every category. Not only do you get a good glimpse and intorduction to the ground-breaking CAN-AM series and it's regular drivers, but also some amazing footage of still-operating race tracks across North America!

For those not knowledgeable of the CAN-AM series, this is a great way to get accustomed to it. All the still-pics and specs don't quite give you the sensation of seeing and hearing a CAN-AM car come racing down the Mario Andretti Straight at Mont-Tremblant, or handling the Esses at Road Atlanta or the gone-but-not-forgotten Riverside Int. Raceway.

This is a great film, using only real footage, no recreations, minimal dialogue and superior 5.1 sound. It starts from CAN-AM's beginnings thru to the next-to-last season and is narrated by some of CAN-AM's regular drivers, who do an astounding job with very little voice-over, on explaining the technology and innovation that made the series ground-breaking and unique. It also kind of gives you a sadness on it's demise as well, as this series was a one-of-a-kind that will likely not be available again because of the aggressive nature and danger that this racing provided at the time.
