3803381,4,B001URA5WA,"Season 3 is the final season of an excellent TV series. Les has always been informative, but this past season he takes it to another level. Now more than ever, Les places himself in scenarios that his audience may more likely personally encounter. He teaches us what to if we find ourselves as a lost hiker or as a lost hunter, and more. It's a shame that there are only six episodes this time around, but I do not blame him. These survival experiences are legitimate unlike some other reality show entertainers.

As a bonus, the DVD does include a special 40 minute Les Stroud production entitled Surviving Urban Disasters.",1245024000,11,624,4.672727272727273

Unlike all the rest of them fakes, Survivor Man doesn't use a camera crew, takes minimum gear and just sets out to explore the unknown.

Les shows by real example. He has to overcome these and even sometimes injury, setbacks.. the elements.. all while showing possible solutions with minimum supplies if any. How to make possible use of your environment and much , much more. He teaches that the best strength one has to survive is the human brain and spirit...and sometimes luck.

3803411,5,B001URA5WA,"SurvivorMan is the real world experience of Les Stroud recorded in seamless documentary form, and delivered to a public. It is not one of those reality TV shows that suffers from poor writers, and non- actors playing their roles in the lowest common denominator fashion that has become so popular on network TV. If you, yourself become stranded or lost, find yourself in a survival situation, and are suddenly thrust into a world that seems to have turned upside down on you, you most certainly will not be accompanied by a full camera crew, light and sound company, or prop managers. No one is going to yell cut, hand you a bottle of water and direct you to craft services for a hearty plate of food. That is the world of entertainment.

Les Stroud as SurvivorMan knows the reality of surviving in the woods. He has been actually living his backwoods survival life style over the years and although he emerges into the modern world in between, he understands what anyone lost in the wilderness is likely to face. That is the man you want to learn from. That too is why he spends time on his shows teaching those of us who romanticize about the surviving in the wilderness from the comfort of our cozy homes with hints, tricks, and tips that might one day make a real difference in real survival situations.

He is a showman, and he travels to exotic, out of the way places to ply his trade. But he also learns and integrates his new knowledge of each location into the show as he demonstrates each step of the way, how he, himself, is coping with the new environments and strives to survive. He does not hide the reality of what lack of food and water and the sheer psychological shock can do to any of us, even those who are strongminded and fit. Occasionally he will also carry with him survival items that are common and available for purchase to give us an on screen trial and review of how they perform but the impact simple tools or other items can have on someone when demoralized by simply struggling to survive. He also plans for each environment and utilizes items that might be commonly found by a survivor. His mastery of his field comes through as he shares some of the simple techniques he has learned, but seldom does he display the more difficult tasks that require years of practice to master. Showman or no, he keeps his audience in mind, and is always working to teach, entertain, and simply allow the watcher to experience that world as he does.

As you might have picked up, I am a fan of Les Stroud. But I know the likelihood of my being stranded is reasonably small. Disaster is always a theoretical threat until it comes to you though. I like being prepared for possible events however, and not only does Les Stroud take you into the wilderness but he also has solid and practical advice that you can use in any unforeseen emergency. If you become more than a passive participant in the show, thinking how to apply his wisdom in situations that you are likely to face can make your life and that of your family better if bad things do happen.",1460678400,,3067,4.492831541218638
3803412,5,B001URA5WA,"I love this show. Nothing is more serious than being alone in the wild and having to film yourself. All the other survivor shows is more entertaining, but it's not serious.

3803436,5,B001URA5WA,"Les Stroud is the Real Deal: he takes his own cameras (treks back and forth setting them up, recording the shot, then taking them down and on with him), handles his own situations completely alone.  Like one of those 'Blair Witch Project,' or 'Cloverfield' style movies, neither we nor the producers don't know what he went through or how he survived until those recordings are recovered! Using (literally) every tool at his disposal (including the ones he has to make), Survivorman Season 3 reminds me that, should ""all else fail,"" it is possible to live without banks, commuting, convenience stores, new clothes, etc, and it sure is great to live in Society!",1397952000,,660,4.892857142857143

3803444,4,B001URA5WA,I think that it would be interesting to have a film crew follow him.  Not always having him set his own gear up.  Just my 2 cents,1391990400,,129,3.740740740740741
3803445,5,B001URA5WA,I enjoy all survival shows and prepper shows as well as books. The knowledge you gain from them is priceless just as long as you actually do what you see on TV or read in a book. You learn a lot more by experiencing it yourself.,1391299200,,228,3.9782608695652173
3803446,5,B001URA5WA,"The biggest reason this is my favorite of the survival genre shows is because he does all of the work himself without help.  He does his own camera work and is (generally) provided no aid during his trials and tribulations.

Other shows will tend to cut through the parts where their stars aren't eating, or are not finding anything to help their journey.  This one shows you those moments.  It shows you the this morsels he will subsist on while he is surviving in a given environment.  Rarely will you see a ""feast"" or amazing shelter.  He does what he needs to in order to keep alive and moving.

My only gripe with this show is that sometimes it can get a little monotonous, but such is survival.  His monologues often sound a little too ""forced"" but it is not a big deal.

Over-all a good show for he couch survivalist.",1391040000,,824,4.403973509933775

3803461,5,B001URA5WA,"Les continues to educate the outdoors-men with season 3 of his Discovery Channel hit.  Every episode contains new information, techniques, and warnings going to show that Survivorman is a spring of bush knowledge.  You will learn a great deal from these dvds especially after several times through them.
Always level headed, Les shows how to stay safe and stay alive during a survival situation.  Do not waste your money on what I like to call ""Hollywood Bush Actors"".  I believe that there are a number of people in the game today that only harm those looking improve their skills.  Many other programs that I have tried to give a chance to have shown people doing things that will greatly increase your risk of being rescued dead.
  If you are an avid hiker, bicyclist, hunter, fisherman, rock climber, camper or a plethora of other activities which I could like I strongly suggest you spend some time with Les Stround (or at least his dvds).  The price on amazon is much better than buying it at Best Buy or on Discovery's website.

3803462,5,B001URA5WA,I enjoy watching Survivorman.  He does all of his own camera work and is truely by him self.  I think he's half crazy how he sets a camera up then re-walks or scales the obstacle just to get it on film from multiple angles.,1376352000,,223,4.045454545454546

3803465,4,B001URA5WA,"If you are interested in envisioning what you would (or should) do when stranded in the wild, watch this show. If you are interested in what Rambo, John McClane, Dora the Explorer, or Lara Croft would do, then don't.

Les Stroud (Survivorman) is the best and most credible of his breed, that breed being simulation-documentary filmmakers who set up survival situations featuring outdoors experts and film the ensuing calamities and hijinks. His hallmark is sincerity and a focus on realism with regard to how he would approach the situation if it were his own life (or yours) at stake. He films himself and leaves behind any camera, support, or medical crew for 7 days at a time. The quality and innovation in the end product makes him, in my opinion, a creative genius.

Season Three gets only 4 stars and not 5 almost _because_ he is a genius. You can see him growing bored of repeating the same formula that made Season One groundbreaking and Season Two a total gem, and beginning to experiment with risky new formats (bringing a Joe Sixpack buddy hunting in Ontario, or some livestock to the Rockies, or indulging in native Amazonian or New Guinean culture, etc.). These new directions later rear their heads more maturely in his other series: Beyond Survival, Survivorman Ten Days, and Survivorman and Son. However, in the context of this series, they feel a bit too much like clumsy noodling and not enough like masterful improvisation. Still, some of the episodes are classics, specifically Outback, Tundra, and Sierra.

Look elsewhere if you are in the mood for staged action stunts (Man vs. Wild, proven to be fraudulent FWIW), staged social tension (season 1 of Dual Survival, Man Woman Wild), or other staged scenarios that infuse reality show elements to liven up a documentary-like format (Out of the Wild Venezuela is a great one). Watch this series if you want a shred of sincerity with your survival.",1375315200,,1916,4.871165644171779

3803471,4,B001URA5WA,"Poor old Les, he always started out his shows with a sense of optimism, but by the end of the second season, he was a major complainer about the plights into which he put himself.  Aside from the scenic values of the places he visited, he really did not deliver on survival techniques.  He suffered through most of his shows.  It finally struck me that he was something of an adventurer who really did not know his limits.  He is lucky to still be alive.",1368921600,,454,4.305882352941176

3803489,5,B001URA5WA,"Season Three of ""Survivorman"" was supposed to be the last. Les Stroud was physically worn out from producing, what is in my opinion, the most ""real"" reality-type show on television. Apparently, after reaching this decision in 2008, he has since changed his mind and is currently producing new episodes. I'm glad.

Survivorman is the aforementioned Les Stroud; a Canadian outdoorsman who, in the past worked as a roadie for the band Rush and also for MTV Canada (!). The concept of his show is quite simple: He goes to an isolated location, hot or cold, and spends seven days there....surviving. Alone.

 Les travels to six locations/episodes for season three. The six episodes are contained on two discs:

Disc 1

Sierra Nevada
Les goes hiking and gets ""lost"". A search party is sent looking for him as he deliberately wanders deeper into the woods, making it that more difficult for the search party to find him.

Colorado Rockies
Les sets out with two pack horses into the Rockies for a week. Having the horses with him is a blessing and curse: they provide him with companionship, but he has to take care of them as well as himself.

Arctic Tundra
Les travels to Baffin Island in the Arctic Archipelago (between Northeast Canada and Greenland) and survives in the brutal cold and ""eeriness"" of 24 hour daylight.

Disc 2

Deep Woods
For the first time ever on Surviviorman, Les isn't alone as he brings a hunting partner with him to the Boreal Forest in Canada.

Australian Outback
Les has to ""emergency land"" his ultralight in the Australian Outback.

Papua New Guinea (the series ""finale"")
Near the end of the series finale, two men approach Les at his camp. One is carrying a machete (well, it is the finale, right?).

Disc 1 also contains a bonus episode: ""Surviving Urban Disasters"", which is fine in its own right, but I believe I would have preferred a ""Making of Season Three"" instead.

I honestly have to rate all six episodes with five stars each.  Granted, I am a huge fan of the show but I cannot think of a single reason to rate any of them with even four and a half stars.

All of these episodes stand out to me but the Arctic Tundra episode is my favorite (if I had to pick one) for its environment and visuals.

Les also has his best success ever with obtaining food in this episode, too....which is another reason why I like the show so much: Les Stroud is upfront about everything he does. He scouts the location out before-hand; brings an emergency GPS phone with him in case of disaster; has an emergency camp nearby; and, except for a few items he carries with him (ranging from one match to a paper clip--or even a can of soda): he has to find his own food, build his own fires and make his own shelters. Alone. For seven days.

If this makes what Les does sound too easy, try camping outside in your own backyard for a week....with full access to your refrigerator, to boot.

I also appreciate that he is never gratuitous in any way with his actions. He spares us the gory details of cleaning and de-shelling a turtle, for example. Furthermore, unlike the crews featured on Deadliest Catch, he watches his language. Very rarely does he swear. Having kids of his own, he fully gets it that kids are watching his show, too, and behaves himself accordingly.

A humorous example, however,  of when Les does swear occurs during the first season (while he is gathering firewood) and all of a sudden he screams: ""Holy s***! A rattlesnake!""

But, you get my point. (And, once again, he spares us the cleaning and preparing for dinner of the rattlesnake).

Discovery rates all Survivorman episodes TV-PG.

I strongly encourage you to give this series a try. Thank you for reading.

3803490,3,B001URA5WA,I think I was very good the package came on time like they said it was supposed to the movie was very good in you learned a lot of stuff wouldn't recommend this product,1338595200,,168,3.9705882352941178
3803491,5,B001URA5WA,How can you go wrong.  If you have any doubts go to YOUTUBE and look for a 4 part series called Snowshoes and Solitude.  Kinda the precurser to Survivorman.  The stuff this guys will do is amazing.  Warning don't watch if you have a weak stomach as some of the stuff he does and eats gets pretty gross.,1325030400,,302,4.155172413793103
3803492,5,B001URA5WA,"Me and my friends, X and Ken, have watched every episode of Survivorman.  We wanted to be Survivorman so much that we formed a club called Survivormen.  We are now climbing the 10 highest peaks in the Catskill Mountains.  So far, we have climbed the top six peaks.  We don't make a fire with our hands, eat worms and grasshoppers, or build a shelter with twigs and leaves.  But Les is our inspiration.  So when we reach the top of each mountain, we toast him and ourselves with Bailey's Irish Cream, eat beef jerky and candy bars, and find a stone to keep as a remembrance.  Then we climb down and go to the same restaurant where we eat like Baptists and get drunk.  We are following in Survivorman's footsteps, more or Les.",1314230400,,724,4.390977443609023
3803493,5,B001URA5WA,"I received this DVD on time from Amazon. It was in plastic wrapped and sealed. This DVD is great! I love all the advise I get from watching Les in the woods. The ""Deep Woods"" episode where Les takes a hunting buddie out with him is my favorite. They hunt, survive and even do a short harmonica duet.",1290211200,,299,4.172413793103448
3803502,4,B001URA5WA,"The guy is genuine. The show does not feel like it is a stage. Nice tips on survival. Can get a bit boring, watching the guy trying to make fire 14 times.

3803503,5,B001URA5WA,"Survivorman Season 3 is the final season, with six episodes and one bonus feature.  I found the episodes pretty interesting, from the Arctic Tundra to the Australian Outback.  In the episode about the Colorado Rockies Les even has to take care of two horses.  In Deep Woods he, and a friend, show you what to do if you get lost while hunting.  And of course, they also show you what not to do, but that's the fun of watching Survivorman.  The bonus is about Urban Disasters, in this case how to survive in a car, at home, or at your place of business if there is a flood.  He deals with such issues as losing power, keeping warm, getting clean water and so on.  I wish there were more DVDs, but I think his show has done a good job of covering most of the bases.
Now, what do you do if you get lost in New York City?  We'll never know.",1266278400,9,835,4.111111111111111

3803509,5,B001URA5WA,"This is the final season of Survivorman. Although it was the weakest of the three, it was still satisfying. I hope Les Stroud continues in his public teaching. His personality is superlative and I hold him in high esteem.",1254614400,7,221,4.6923076923076925
3803510,3,B001URA5WA,"This season has gotten pretty weak. He brought a tent and a sleeping back on one ""survival"" trek. If you're looking for hardcore ideas and understanding about surviving in the wild Survivor man, and I say this with a heavy heart because the first seasons were great, is no longer for you.",1249776000,2,288,4.5576923076923075
3803511,2,B001URA5WA,"The Sierra Nevada has Les ""lost"" while a search party hunts for him. He has a backpack, a tent, a sleeping bag and his guitar. While in the Rockies he had two horses, one for him and one for his camera equipment, a makeshift bedroll, canvas to make a shelter, and a fishing rod. Is this survival or a camping trip?

Another episode has Les stranded in the jungle of Papua, New Guinea. Most of the time he complains about his surroundings and the claustrophobia brought on by the jungle. But as soon as Les steps out of the wet rainforest and into the open he whines about the sun making him sweat. He brought bananas, nuts, candy and other treats with him this time. He reminds us for the 100th time how difficult it is for him to film his adventures, and how he could die if he breaks an ankle or gets bitten by a poisonous spider. We also get four full minutes of him chewing on jungle nuts, while he spits, drools and gets high.

Nothing thrilling about the Outback either, except he didn't complain as much about having to shuffle his camera equipment around. Splitting one match into two isn't new and exciting, nor is watching him filter water through sand, or pluck edible bugs from the trees.

Les tries to catch a pig, but fails. Les tries to snare a rat, but fails. He couldn't even catch one bird out of a flock of 12 or more. He talks constantly about having diarrhea and vomiting from drinking bad water. He couldn't cross a stream because he was afraid he'd fall. Then came the bemoaning about the rash and jungle fungus on his feet. He whined about the ants, the ticks, the spiders, the mosquitoes, the rain and the weather, and even the bad dreams brought on my hunger. Good grief.

There are only six episodes on this DVD, but that's probably just as well. I couldn't stand much more of his suffering and bemoaning.

The first two seasons were first rate. This third is lacking in luster and thrills. The Survivorman series is getting stale and repetitive. Les doesn't appear to be enjoying himself anymore.

I hope Les has something new up his sleeve. I love this guy. I'd hate for him to just disappear from the screen or, God forbid, to keep doing what he's doing, which is complaining all the time. Les is a fantastic photographer and survivalist, but it's time for a change.",1248393600,5,2296,4.441805225653207
