8212131,5,B000U5GKU4,"A very good presentation of classic modern buildings around the world. I discovered classic European buildings that I didn't know about. You can buy volumes 1 to 5 in a box set from Amazon. FR or ARTE in France, but you have to pay shipping charges. Volumes 6 to 8 have to be bought separately, unless they eventually produce a large box set with volume 1 to 8. The DVDs are multizones, so they can be read on our North American DVD players.",1422057600,,441,4.325301204819277
