623393,1,6303295576,"Even though my political leanings seem to be diametrically opposed to Chomsky's, the movie addresses a topic I think is even more important now than when the documentary was made. In other words, the echo chamber is very real, and whether this phenomena is part of a conspiracy or not, it most definitely is a problem. But while I agree with the underlying theme, I have a few significant problems with the film.

First, I dislike the autobiographical aspects of the film. I want to hear Chomsky's opinions about the media and watch him argue these opinions. Too much of the first hour of the film addresses the genesis of Chomsky's ideology. This is not a problem in and of itself, but the movie is called, ""Manufacturing Consent"". Come on, let's stick to the subject.

As far as Chomsky himself goes, I appreciate his level-headed style. He doesn't get excited or emotional. He doesn't seek to humiliate his opponents. I have a lot of respect for that. I also respect the fact that he questions institutions. What I dislike is that his research is obviously dedicated to reinforcing his own bias. This is a major problem in modern society and I see it displayed prominently in his personality.

I also have a problem with the general scope of the film. It's too big. It's simply not possibly to address the topic as it relates to Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timur, Desert Storm, and the multitude of other media related issues the film addresses without breezing through the topic. I want to hear details!

A good example is the part of the movie that addresses a French professor. While I appreciate Chomsky's defense of his actions and I agree that we should defend freedom of speech, it wasn't really something that should be included in the film even while it is an example of how views considered absurd are beaten out of public discourse. He could have addressed this phenomena in regards to one of the other examples of consent manufacturing given in the documentary. I felt like this was done as much to defend a perceived black spot in Chomsky's career as it was to make a statement about modern media.

As if the movie hasn't broached enough, it then addresses,

The phenomena by which people seem to be more concerned with the faces promoting ideas than with the ideas themselves.

The TV medium and how too much time spent with it detaches us from productive endeavors.

How alternative media can counter corporatist media.

How many many issues were ignored in the media until recently.

How detached the political system has become from society at large.

How our representative democracy is inferior to direct democracy.

The Chomsky alternative to capitalism.

How destructive capitalism is.

When he discusses the Spanish Civil War in one sentence, I find it sad that he never mentions that before it was destroyed by the nationalists, the anarchist movement in Spain was destroyed by Soviet agents. He's unwittingly guilty of his own criticism of media bias by regurgitating the standard slanted view of the Spanish Republic. You would think a person claiming to be an anarchist would mention that the Spanish Anarchists were largely purged from the Republic by communists long before the fascists killed the republic. Sadly, this fact was lost on the American left because of the all too human tendency to ignore what we don't wish to see.

In the end, I appreciate the topic of the movie. In the so-called Information Age, the need to look at this information critically cannot be stressed enough. The film also makes a very important point; that our news tends to be extremely superficial. I wish the film would have made a point to explain that the topics being addressed in the news might be a good starting point for further research. It simply disregards the corporatist media. While the film makes some good points, it's simply too general, unfocused and vague and too focused on the man rather than what the film purports to be about. At the beginning of the movie, I thought it deserved a 5 star rating. As it went on, I liked it less and less. In the end, I just found it bizarre.

In short, the movie suffers from the same criticism you see of Chomsky's books. It's meandering and unfocused. Seriously, whoever edited this film should find another career.",1391040000,3,4283,4.7753721244925575

This film follows Chompsky through various appearances from ""The Firing Line"" with W.F. Buckley to local radio interviews and lectures. Mr. Chomsky's focus on the media is clear & unwavering.

It starts out with ""They who have put out the people's eyes reproach them for their blindness"" - John Milton-1642

I have heard more of the detractor's arguments then the actual words of Chomsky. So it was time to at least watch this 2 hr and 45 minute documentary to get a general feel for what the controversy is all about.

Unfortunately this documentary is in sound bite form so you get tads of what is being said before changing the subject.

A good percentage of the documentary covers the goings on in East Timor. The rest is an aggregate of a Chomsky biography more than just a philosophy.

While it only scratches the surface of Chomsky's many ideas, this is a worthwhile introduction to both the man, and one particular element of his theories - namely that all major US media is only serving the interest of the corporate/government oligarchy, of which they are really a part.

Never boring, but sometimes repetitive.

Gets points for being willing to clearly present intelligent opposing points of view, despite the film's obvious siding with Chomsky. Loses points for stylistically doing some of the very sort of manipulative story-telling Chomsky is railing against, and for focusing on certain aspects of his ideas too long at the expense of others.

623509,5,6303295576,"This is a well considered portrait of a man whose implausible name is globally respected and disdained in equally fervent measure. Noam Chomsky is professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 'arguably the most important intellectual alive'. Apart from his incomparable contribution to the academic field of linguistics he is perhaps better known for his disarmingly erudite pronouncements and well supported arguments about the political and social culture at large. The success of his rhetoric (apart from very often being self evidently incontrovertible) is that he creates a context in which the listener can think and an environment in which the listener/reader can enjoy insightful and important ideas as their own.

His detractors are usually characterized by bilious invective, aimed not at his ideas but at the man himself, and so offer no intellectual value. For example one William F Buckley Jr's thoughtful response to Chomsky's musings comes as a threat to 'smash him in the Goddamn face'.

This film is bristling with refreshingly original thought and a kind of politically principled, dynamic enthusiasm for the ideas being expressed, that when set against the dumb utterances more commonly heard in public may appear to some as subversive. But then as Wilde once said 'Public opinion exists only where there are no ideas'. Chomsky's encyclopaedic knowledge is compelling to witness and enables quite complex notions to be framed in tangible simple and pertinent references. No conspiracy theorist, Chomsky's arguments don't speculate over the unknown. Rather they strip away the facade of the known to examine the methods and techniques a modern state employs to maintain general consensus, obedience and complicity from it's people. Never exclusive or elitist, yet fascinatingly persuasive and absorbing this insight into stimulating idea is the perfect antidote to the mindless cheery distractions so endlessly peddled as entertainment today. It's also very reassuring to hear informed articulation of so much you have always had a sneaking suspicion about. You really should see this.",1266537600,3,2132,5.496951219512195

623564,5,6303295576,"It is NOT about Noam Chomsky. Chomsky quite frankly isn't really *that* interesting as a personality to study and watch movies about. Needless to say, his accomplishments as an intellectual in the field of linguistics -modern linguistics being almost invented by him, and of course as the arch-critic of US power par-excellence, make him fascinating. He is a genius, obviously. But it is what use he put his razor sharp analytical mind and photographic memory that is incredible. So look at the results. Aside from that, his life is his own and he views it really as none your business and nothing any of us should care about. What matters is his work and while the film does delve into the personal to an extent, this documentary is focused on *the media*.

If you have an interest in understanding the world you live in, watch the documentary and read the book. Buy the DVD, watch it with friends, talk about it, share it with others.

Years ago a friend made a remark to me, something along the lines of, ""Chomsky looks more and more right"". This was years before the build up to the Iraq War. Sadly, Chomsky's analysis (along with Edward Herman) of the corporate media is still as accurate as ever, if not more so. This film won't make you feel good, but it'll help make you a bit smarter.",1205971200,4,1293,4.568965517241379
623565,5,6303295576,"This film is beautifully done.  The filmmakers brilliantly crafted a mix of archival footage with Chomsky's talks to illustrate his points.  Despite the sometimes grim topics, they manage to make it entertaining, even humorous at times.  Dubbed by the New York Times as ""the most important intellectual alive,""  Chomsky is a brilliant man who is dedicated to bringing his important message to the world. He cares about the common person, and wants to help liberate all of us from an oppressive government that he shows does not serve our best interests. His detailed and life long research has convinced him that our government has become a marketing arm for corporations instead of its people.  As a former investigative journalist, my own findings concur.  Chomsky's analysis is honest, factual, and is based on thorough research that only a person of great scholarship can achieve. We are fortunate to have him in the world.  His findings about the use of media to control public views is not a pretty picture, but one that every American should know about. He is definitely on the side of the underdog, which at this point in our nation's history, includes most of the U.S. population, save a small elite class of billionaires. If anyone doubts his brilliance and his accuracy, consider this -- he has no commercial affiliations and nothing to gain by sacrificing his life to helping people to understand the truth of our government's efforts to make us subservient to corporate interests. He is a full tenured professor at M.I.T. and could have just as easily taught linguistics his whole life, spent his days reading and researching, as most intellectuals love to do, and stayed at home with his family. But he has spent most of his life traveling around the country and the world patiently explaining to people (with facts to back up every point he makes) how the mainstream media programs us to support corporate interests.",1191456000,4,1931,4.941358024691358
623566,2,6303295576,"I watched this documentary because I genuinely wanted to understand what all the fuss is about over Noam Chomsky.

When I ended up doing is sitting through a very long series of film bytes where several interviews, spanning several decades, were cut up into pieces and splattered over nearly three hours of almost stream-of-consciousness of audio and video input to my brain. Mixed in there were Chomsky's many accusations against the media and the US government but almost nothing concrete to back up those accusations.  I guess I just have to take Noam Chomsky's word for it.  And why wouldn't I?  Noam Chomsky is the greatest intellectual alive, or something like that, according to a quote somewhere toward the beginning.

Somewhere back in all those film bytes, Chomsky makes the point the media is used to get two classes of people (the 20% political class and the 80% everyone else, if I remember correctly) to ""go along"" with the government and the faceless elite who run those huge corporations.  We see footage of TV network news people looking for sound bytes.  And the irony is that it seemed to me that this entire documentary is a series of images and sound bytes that try to get me to ""go along"" with Chomsky without really asking him to prove his accusations and conspiracy theories.  The ambiance of this documentary makes me feel like I'm on the end of manipulation, and also ironically some of Chomskys critics that are shown arguing with Chomsky make at least as much sense to me as Chomsky does.

Anyway, if the viewer has a very long attention span and already is a Noam Chomsky fan, then this will likely be very enjoyable.  However, I personally would not recommend this documentary as an introduction to Noam Chomsky.  All I'm sure of after watching this is that Chomsky makes a lot of people mad and that he's really into conspiracies.

Finally, it also all seems very outdated because it was done before the advent of the Internet.  Anyone with something to say can reach everyone now, and that wasn't possible when this documentary was made.",1190160000,12,2069,4.761904761904762

So remember when you call someone anti-American (or America-hating), you're actually being a good Soviet.

623569,4,6303295576,"A fabulous documentary of a genius cult leader. Move over Branch Davidians! Excelent interviews with defenders and critics, it's all Chomsky all the time!

Production values are okay for a documentary, although I would have preferred more shaky cam action, in keeping with the constant disorienting in order to reorient you that is so common with Chomskyites.

Noam Chomsky is a religious cult, and has skills even a dead Mesmer envies. Master of the rapid-fire counterfactual (if he wore a tinfoil hat and didn't bath, you'd mistake him for a schizophrenic homeless person), one cannot escape the construct of his rhetoric, simply because it is a closed hermeneutic circle of simultaneously no authority and his own node of authority. The Chomsky tautology is the ultimate ""ommmm"" chant for leftists who have abandoned the search for god, become disgusted with the idol of themselves in God's place, and need that vacuum of prophetic voice filled with someone. Enter clown Chomsky, stage left.

Chomsky isn't a Holocaust denier, and the backwater back and forth arguments of Semitic anti-Semites is such a stew it has expelled a good many well-intended leftists from the cacophony of the kvetching. But he is far worse, he is a Khmer Rouge auto genocide denier, and on a proportional scale the Cambodian genocide was far graver than the Holocaust (spare me your elevation of a Western European post enlightenment horror indignation preference construct over the troubles of the little brown people, you Colonialist revanchist you).

Chomsky, in other words, is an ideologue par excellence: he can deny fact.

For those of you who've gotten this far and are still Chomsky apologists: please read the Anti-Chomsky Reader for actual scholarly rebuttals to his thinking and positions.",1174867200,7,1781,5.191637630662021
623570,5,6303295576,"While researching 9/11 denial I came across a very interesting video on a debunking web site which featured Noam Chomsky making the statement along the lines (and I am paraphrasing) that in a controlled experiment we know what the apparatus are, the procedure, the results and then we base our conclusions on facts. In an uncontrolled situation, we don't always know what the apparatus is, the procedure or the results and so we find that we can push the facts or evidence in any direction we like (albeit to active scepticism, something Chomsky proposes as vital to the rational mind). While Chomsky is certainly not a 9/11 denier (he believes the evidence logically and rationally points to a foreign terrorist attack) he firmly acknowledges the ease of which it is to manipulate facts without challenge. In this way he is all for the ""freedom of speech"" so that we can at least experience all the variations in interpreting the facts (if we do get all the facts!). At his heart Chomsky just wants more exposure and more coverage of dissidents in the mainstream media so that people can make up their own minds, instead of having their minds made up for them.

The freedom of speech is not without its own problems that Chomsky himself has found himself caught up in. I was equally interested in the topic of Jews who are anti-Semites, something Chomsky has been accused of, although unjustly so. If a Jew makes a statement about the Holocaust that is not true then are they a Holocaust denier? The answer here is that most Jews would claim these people have stopped being Jewish and so should not be called anti-Semitist Jews, but just simply anti-Semites. Chomsky was told that someone questioning some things about the Holocaust in the ""French Faurisson affair"" was prevented from freely expressing his opinions and Chomsky was asked to write a paper on the basics of the freedom of speech. The paper was then used, unknown to Chomsky, by Faurisson's publishers as a foreword for the holocaust denial book. Chomsky was then automatically linked to this holocaust denial because of it. The bottom line here is that just because you believe in the freedom of speech does not mean that you are in agreement with the content of the speech, but believe in the freedom to be able to speak. In many ways this means that Chomsky is aware that propaganda, of all kinds, be it from the White House or a Holocaust denier is covered under the basics of the freedom of speech (note the term basics, not advanced, in which we learn that some things should not be freely made available to everybody). However, if we start to suppress the freedom of speech then are we not acting like the dictator Nazi's that curbed those freedoms? As you can see the debate is a major one.

When a single conclusion is drawn and pushed by one body then our experience with this topic is limited to the one body proposing it. If the body, such as the White House, is a very powerful one, then we find that smaller bodies in an attempt to ""keep up with the joneses"" tend to regurgitate it without question. Journalists working within the larger bodies acknowledge this problem. They understand that deadlines pressures, limited column space and front desk judgment is why they need to maintain some rules or else their imperfect media structures would simply become an even bigger mess and probably promote more error and contradictions than they already do. They don't deny it. Imagine if say the New York Times does question the White House's statement. Chances are if the NYT counterpoint is judged a bigger statement than the WH statement, then the smaller bodies will generally go with the NYT counterpoint to improve sales. While we would like to jump up and say, ""Hold on here a moment, we aren't all stupidly duped fools, journalists can use their brains too!"" Chomsky goes the extra mile by saying that these rules and judgements within America's major media management systems are `manufacturing consent' because of their limitations. If it takes 40 minutes to explain something, then obviously that person isn't going to appear on a half hour show that has ten minutes worth of advertisements (need to pay the wages and bills). Chomsky lists the major regulations in place in the media that prevent journalists from exercising better judgement (common sense) and how this affects the populace that is exposed to it.

Chomsky then brings up American involvement in East Timor and Cambodia and how the American media covered nothing of American involvement (or active ignorance) until as such time as they could find an appropriate bad guy on which to lay the blame. When the bad guys showed up, the Khmer Rogue, suddenly the media became extremely active and the stories pasted from start to finish across the media. This case study proves beyond a doubt that there is a real overwhelming factual instance of the deliberate suppression of information by the American media in order to manufacture consent. It is the key evidence that Chomsky uses when he puts the media (and us!) on trial.

Without dissident voices Chomsky proclaims that the masses are being brain-washed into not questioning anything. That 80% should be satisfied with the sports section while the remaining 20% promote the consent through political and management systems. Chomsky says that we should be aware of the propaganda and thus automatically supersede this system that is in place by simply questioning what we read, see and hear. He firmly believes the power of better judgement and common sense is what makes a society influence its government as opposed to a government, or media, or us (and we are to blame for most of it!), that influences its society in how to act and think. This is scientific thinking. It is good, not bad. Chomsky himself is the experiment in action. As a dissident questioning propaganda he finds himself lambasted and sometimes torn about by the media and government officials. Chomsky is living proof that the propaganda machine is in action. Note however that he does not think that America is a dictatorship trying to suppress him (obviously he is freely able to go about saying what he wants to say). Chomsky believes that America is one of the few nations that have this ability to notice these things and to do something about them by looking at alternative sources. If we walk away from the challenge then we have lost already. This isn't about finding a comfortable platform to talk about `conspiracy hypothesis' (note I use the term hypothesis because theories are made of facts, so a conspiracy theory is in fact a `conspiracy fact' such as the Watergate scandal as opposed to a conspiracy hypothesis like there are aliens visiting Earth on spacecraft) it is about actively engaging your own society about this, wherever you are.

If you have never heard about Chomsky before, then this is the documentary to watch. Don't be afraid to have a dictionary and a pause button on standby. It is often called one of the most important documentaries ever made and I would strongly agree with that position without reservation. Get those brain neurons to start firing again and if you like this then certainly you will be delving into his literature. I know I will.

(As a closing note the monkey human language model that was in question in this documentary has since been expanded on, although a controversy still remains in academic science circles. You might want to go find out more about it, although this is exactly the kind of attitude Chomsky promotes. Think for yourself!)",1172966400,3,7573,4.830508474576271
623601,4,6303295576,"""Manufacturing consent"" is a very good documentary that introduces the spectator to Noam Chomsky's ideas and political views, thanks to interesting footage of some of his interviews and conferences.

I think that this documentary is ideal for those who would like to know more about Chomsky, but don't want to read several of his books in order to do so. All the same, I must highlight the fact that you will probably learn less by watching this dvd than if you decide to devote time to reading his books and articles, and that this dvd only includes footage until 1992. By that, I mean that there is more to Chomsky's ideas than what is shown in this documentary, but that watching it is a very good way to start.

All in all, I can say that even though ""Manufacturing consent"" is very long, it will make you think and it is a good introduction to Chomsky. Those are the reasons why the time you spend watching ""Manafucturing consent"" will not be time lost. Recommended!

However, this documentary is really a tribute to and catalog of Chomsky's ideas and character.  Although I feel Chomsky is entirely worthy of admiration if only for his dogged adherence to the ideal of freedom, I also thought this film was too much the work of fans and not documentarians.  Of course, there are very few documentaries that don't make similar mistakes, but I think, for the sake of making Chomsky's ideas and known and understood, this kind of romanticism of him does a disservice to that objective.  To the extent that this film does deal with the ideas of his book, it does an admirable job of getting his points across, most notably in the first half of the film.

I also thought that the film ran too long and much of the last half of it could have been removed without much effect on its clarity.

There's a governing elite in America, the theory states, whose goals and objectives are protected and forwarded by a press that seeks to marginalize and demoralize the great majority of Americans who don't belong to the elite group.  Rather than a free marketplace of ideas, the press is a propaganda arm of the elite.

  MANUFACTURING CONSENT, made in 1993, sends a film crew along with Chomsky as he travels the country, speaking at colleges and on public radio programs.  It also uses a fair amount of archive footage, including tape of Chomsky debating William F. Buckley on Buckley's `Firing Line' program and French philosopher Michael Foucault.  The complete tape of both encounters, each lasting about 15 minutes, are included in the special features, along with a short interview with Chomsky in 2002 asking him his retrospective reaction to MANUFACTURING CONSENT.

  I think those who agree with Chomsky will throw five stars at this one, while those who disagree (if they bother to watch it at all) will be a lot more stingy with their stars.  If you agree you'll probably appreciate the parade of examples - like the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 - the film uses in support of its premise.  If you think the premise is fatally flawed you'll probably find this movie excruciating.  I believe it's as balanced as could be expected.  Obviously you don't travel with a documentary subject like Chomsky unless you agree with his arguments, but the film does include some balancing comments by the likes of Tom Wolfe and Jeff Greenfield.  Greenfield, a Nightline producer at the time, responds to charges that Chomsky has never appeared on the program with the convincing observation that his style isn't suited to the demands of television, a fact the movie tends to support.  Chomsky is a good public speaker but he does run on some, seemingly totally allergic to the pithy phrase or the stinging soundbite.

623669,5,6303295576,"Unfortunately, someone with a background like Dr. Chomsky is barely known to the American public. I myself found out about him only a couple of months ago when one of his books was on my Amazon recommendations.

This documentary is in three parts. The first part details Chomsky's background and shows him giving various speeches. The second part is about the differences in coverage of Cambodia and East Timor. When we (the U.S. government and U.S. public -ignorantly or innocently) was commiting atrocities in Cambodia, it was not in the newspaper, when Pol Pot commited atrocities, it's in the paper.  Also when Indonesia annexed East Timor and commited genocide - no mention in the paper again. Sadly, President Ford went to Indonesia and specifically wanted Indonesia to invade only after he left.  As the genocide went on in East Timor, the American government as well as most Western governments did nothing to stop it - if there is a profit to be made, it is more important than helping people. The second part also shows some criticism directed toward Professor Chomsky - criticism from Tom Wolfe, the New York Times, and various other people.

Also there is a scene about how a French professor wants to deny that concentration camps existed (during the Holocaust). Chomsky as well as other intellectuals signed a petition which stated that this French professor has a right to say what he wants - Chomsky didn't agree with it, but the state has no right to punish him for saying something. Dr. Chomsky also rights a little piece of ""free speech"" and the French professor uses that piece as the preface of his book.  This makes it seem like Chomsky is supporting what the professor is saying which he is not.  This caused outrage in France and to Israelis. Dr. Chomsky tries to defend himself against people who label him as racist and anti-Semetic.

The third part is about how we can each make a difference. Dr. Chomsky challenges us to review various news medias and make up our own minds. We should also organize, create our own alternative media and/or inform others.  We should remember - if anyone challenges us to check their sources or to actually pay attention to the government and media - it means this person is not afraid of what they stand for. Only if a person discourages people from trying to think independently, then that person is scared of what they stand for.

Sadly, even though this movie was made in 1992, there is still a huge amount of information our mainstream American media does not cover. For example, if you tell most Americans about the sanctions which killed 500,000 Iraqi children from 1991-2003 - how many people would say yeah they know? Most people would either wonder what we are talking about or just blame it on Saddam Hussein.

The video clips which are shown from all over the world as well video clips showing America and other countries history is excellent. A time when someone (like Chomsky) has to defend themselves for caring about human rights is a sad time indeed.",1108252800,11,3027,4.77055449330784
623670,5,6303295576,"I've never been able to slog through any of Chomsky's books, but this documentary is completely accessible.  He has some great insights into how the media really works, and what that means for our society.

I've seen this movie several times, and it is still just as relevant as when it first came out.  If anything, the issues Chomsky addresses have become more urgent today.",1107734400,7,376,4.753846153846154
623711,5,6303295576,"This film from 1992 is an excellent introduction for Noam Chomsky's views for those unfamiliar (or only passingly familiar) with him, similar to the ""Dummies"" book series.  The film is quite long at nearly 3 hours, but there is an intermission about half way through.  There are also extended excerpts from two debates (my favorite is Chomsky dealing with Buckley's talking over him constantly) and an all-too-brief interview with Chomsky on the film from 2002.  I say ""all-too-brief"" because this would have been an opportunity for Chomsky to update his thesis following the terrorist attacks on the US on 9/11/01 and the subsequent mobilization.  One also wonders how he would characterize the Bush administration response to the attacks, but perhaps he was restrained given that the attacks occurred less than 6 months prior to the interview.

Chomsky repeated claims he eschews ""sound bites"" in his interviews, but he actually sound bites quite well (a credit to the filmmakers' editing).  He is seen mostly in clips for various talks and debates, some of the debates in a quite informal setting allowing for more pointed and specific remarks to be made.  Chomsky's background is put in perspective well (early upbringing and influences as well as his linguistics work at MIT), but the core of the film is his thesis that the mass media is a tool to help form public opinion to allow the government to carry out specific policies that benefit an elite few.

The film is not a Chomsky love-fest in that countering views are presented (in particular, the editor of the New York Times), though clearly the point of view of the film is that Chomsky is correct in his thesis.  Two central examples of Chomsky's thesis are the comparison of media coverage between Cambodia and East Timor in the late 70's and the clear difference between defending someone's right to free speech without agreeing with the ideas proposed.  What is most disturbing is Chomsky's discussion of how the media can marginalize those who even raise questions and in an eerie sense predicts the talking head shouting matches (laced with meaningless labels and rhetoric) that passes for ""debate"" today in the media.

Chomsky's writings, though he claims they're for the large mass of people that the state would like to simply not participate in the political process, are usually too difficult for the average attention span today.  This DVD provides a very watchable, clear introduction to Chomsky's ideas and may provide the motivation to go through his writings.  For those who think Chomsky is a liberal (as he is often labled), listen to when he discusses Carter's policies in Timor, and recall Carter was the ""human rights"" president.  Highly recommended, considering the present state of the media in the US.  The world is far more complex than the views you get on TV and when you ask the question:  ""why do they hate us so"", you need to remember that you may not even have all the information to answer the question.",1103414400,12,2997,4.928429423459245

623714,5,6303295576,"This film is an entertaining and gripping look at the life and ideas of MIT professor Noam Chomsky', the ""most quoted person alive"". And, most importantly, it discusses the ""Propaganda Model"", an institutional system that he and Edward Herman (professor emeritus at Wharton's School of business) developed in the late 80's on how media contributes to manufacturing consent within a free society.

It is an entirely rational system, and has NOTHING to do with conspiracies. The fact that Big Business owns and operates most media in a narrowing field and behaves in a business like fashion is not a conspiracy. Corporations are not in the business to undermine themselves. They are not run by a centralize cabal of sinister business men (though some such as Disney and Sinclair are capable of wielding quite overt censorship and propaganda as seen in the election of 2004). They generally operate in a legal manner.

Also, the ""Propaganda Model"" has NOTHING to do with a police state as suggested by some who have criticize this film (and who clearly have not seen it!). Indeed, Chomsky insists that this system works best in a free society - insisting that western nations are free and open. According the Chomsky, the ""Propaganda Model"" is in fact more effective in our free society than the inept heavy handed totalitarian propaganda often found in a police state, since people can be coerced by force in such a system. Here citizens need more gentile persuasion. The film includes ample case studies that back up this thesis. They also have included critics of Chomsky whose weak arguments fall over flat within seconds.

But this has no bearing on whether the material in it contains a damning amount of fact about big business. One of Noam's powerful means of teaching is to draw reasonable 'event parallels' to show how the media does not really consider objectively informing the public as it's highest motivating cause. This would be an even more amazing film if it were brought up to our current event context. The film was made in 1993, and many of it's educational fruits are more apt today that they were 11 years ago.

623717,5,6303295576,"With the recent media frenzy surrounding Michael Moore's documentary, Fahrenheit 911, it is interesting to observe how the controversy currently swirling around it (Disney backed it financially but won't distribute it) has been documented in the press. It makes a film like Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media all the more relevant more than ten years after its release. Chomsky is a soft-spoken professor at MIT who has become quite a vocal political activist and critic of the American media. He believes that ordinary people can comprehend and act on the issues he raises, but this is not always an easy task because of the thick web of doublespeak that the government creates to blind us from what he calls the ""elementary truths"" that are right in front of us.
However, people are indoctrinated to be apathetic so that they don't want to make the effort that is needed to see what is really going on. And the media doesn't help either. In fact, one might say that they promote this sense of apathy by showing redundant, repetitive sitcoms and reality shows that turn us into mindless couch potatoes. Now, you might be thinking, this sounds like a lot of conspiracy theory garbage, but Chomsky does not look, act or speak like some crazed conspiracy nut. He is an intelligent man who talks to a BBC reporter the same way he would talk to an ordinary person. Chomsky is a clear and concise speaker who backs up everything he says with an ample supply of facts and unfaltering logic. He is a man dedicated to uncovering the deception and atrocities that are committed by governments all over the world and teaching others how to become aware of and act on these acts.
With funding from the National Film Board of Canada, Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar followed Chomsky around the globe for five years. The result was a two hour and forty-five minute documentary that explored Chomsky's view of the media and his relationship with it. The film acts as a sort of ""stepping stone"" to Chomsky's books, which are filled with pretty heavy concepts and a lot of information to absorb. The film doesn't water down his ideas, but rather represents them on a visual level so that they are a bit easier to grasp.
In Manufacturing Consent, Chomsky reveals that all major decisions over what happens in our society are controlled by a heavily concentrated network of corporations, conglomerates and investment firms. This network also has considerable influence over positions in the government. Just looking at the big Savings and Loans scandals that plagued the U.S. a few years ago reveals this link. Corporations also own the media and therefore decide what we watch and hear for the most part. They control the resources and as a result show only what is in their best interests. This is achieved by propaganda or the ""manufacturing of consent,"" a term borrowed from political philosopher and journalist, Walter Lippmann. Manufacturing consent is a technique of control over the masses-in other words, propaganda or the creation of necessary illusions to marginalize the general public or reduce them to apathy in some form. The news media participates in this manufacture of consent by simplifying, selecting, and dramatizing events.
Wintonick and Achbar take a look at various forms of alternative media, from the successful independent publishers, South End Press to Alternative Radio that is dedicated to reporting events that the U.S. media conveniently ignores and giving people like Noam Chomsky more exposure. The film has certainly exposed Chomsky's ideas to a wider audience creating a sort of cult following in Canada and in Europe where he is more popular than in his native United States.
The film doesn't talk down to the viewer and brilliantly conveys Chomsky's ideas on a visual level utilizing all forms of media. The directors also dedicate time to show some of Chomsky's detractors like William F. Buckley, Jr. and Tom Wolfe who come across like pretentious bullies while Chomsky appears calm and rational in response to their vicious, snide attacks. They are ironic scenes that add more credibility to Chomsky's views.
Manufacturing Consent is a fascinating look Chomsky and his ideas that are guaranteed to provoke discussion. It also makes one want to check out some of his work and sparks a desire to wake up and realize what is going on in our society. The film is a real eye-opener to the behind the scenes mechanics of our government and the media and how little we realize what they are really up to. The film does not dip into tabloid or conspiracy depths, but presents a logical and intelligent analysis with a good sense of humour that is often missing from such material. Chomsky is a man who sincerely believes that we can identify and react to the problems in our government and media, but realizes that it cannot be done by just one man, it will take a massive grass-roots organization. First, people must be educated and this is hard because it is so easy to do nothing. Realizing that there is a problem is the first step, correcting it is the next.",1085616000,37,5094,4.8765859284890425

623719,5,6303295576,"Manufacturing Consent is the 1992 documentary directed by
Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick about the perennial dissident lecturer Noam Chomsky.  The focus is on how the media deals with both Chomsky and the issues he raises:  mainly by ignoring him.  Here we get clips of everything from his discussion with William F. Buckley from the 1960s to interviews in Europe to his 10 second clip on McNeil-Lehrer.
  Chomsky is shown as an important force that critiques both the destructive policies of power elites as well as the media that keeps the masses ignorant by spoon feeding them non-critical propaganda.  The scenes are cleverly done with some humor, showing Chomsky speaking on Times Square screens and such.
  And yet this isn't a quintessential Chomsky film as it does narrow the focus to the media, and spends a lot of time on a French Holocaust denier and Chomsky defending his right to speak (though not his views).  This is a bit of a side track from his true significance as an Anarchist, Human Rights, and Peace activist.  But when we hear his views on Vietnam, East Timor, Central America, and Iraq we start to see the bigger picture.  Namely that everything the media tells us is half-truth if not outright false.
  His message is important and it comes through in this film.  Is he always right?  I would say no, but he always sticks to his guns, never wavers, to the point where his views get predictable.  But without him the peace movement would be much worse off intellectually (we'd be stuck with the likes of Michael Parenti wining at us).  Chomsky is always low key, not in your face, and this film paints a sympathetic portrait while giving him some exposure the U.S. media usually denies him.",1076976000,19,1715,4.739864864864865
623720,3,6303295576,"Avram Noam Chomsky was born in 1928, the son of Jewish parents who worked as Hebrew language teachers. Young Noam showed promise in the brains department, devouring huge stacks of books and learning languages at an extremely young age. He went to the University of Pennsylvania after high school, where he eventually earned a doctoral degree in 1955 in the field of linguistics. Quickly snapped up by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky went on to develop a larger theory of language that soon won him worldwide acclaim, leading some people to refer to him as the ""Einstein of Linguistics."" Still residing at MIT to this day, Chomsky is perhaps better known as one of the preeminent social critics of American foreign policy and the American corporate media systems. The author of literally dozens of books on linguistics and contemporary social problems, Chomsky continues to make his rounds on the lecture circuit in an effort to awaken citizens to the dangers present in the power structures of the United States.
""Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media"" represents the efforts of three documentary filmmakers to condense Chomsky's ideas about the media and the structures of American power into a nearly three hour visual presentation. The title of the film, according to Chomsky, comes from a phrase coined by Walter Lippmann, an early twentieth century public intellectual who feared the American public to such an extent that he argued for the implementation of specific methods to control and shape public opinion. This, says Chomsky, leads us to our present predicament, a situation where elites in American society acquire control of media through corporate institutions in order to manage the flow of information to the public. In other words, propaganda supporting elite activities is the name of the game at the New York Times, ABC, NBC, CNN, CBS, The Washington Post, and other primary forces in the news business. Secondary or tertiary news outlets simply take their cues from these trendsetters, often running stories only after the national elite media decide that they are stories.
Moreover, the media systems filter out dissident opinions through various techniques. One of these methods is ""concision,"" or giving limited airtime or column space to a specific story in order to control the parameters of that story. Chomsky claims concision keeps people like him out of the news because only allowing a person to make comments within a two-minute period does not let new ideas get through. If a person should get on the air and claim that the government bears primary responsibility for the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, for example, the audience would want to know a lot of facts about such an alien idea. According to Chomsky, this rarely happens. Instead, the short time allotted to guests on a news show serve only to reinforce already accepted propagandistic platitudes that ultimately support elite positions. ""Concision"" keeps new ideas out and stymies debate regarding accepted ideas. There are several more points to Chomsky's theory in the film, along with a test case concerning the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in the 1970s presented in an effort to prove the propaganda model. I am leaving a ton of stuff out here, but since I also believe that the media promotes elite interests, the whole thing ultimately boils down to what type of news system we should have.
The good professor supports alternative/small press media as a balance to the huge corporate news systems, and I agree with this conclusion too. For far too long, big East Coast interests have controlled what the majority of the population eats, thinks, wears, and discusses. There is simply no geographical balance. The recent blackout in New York City had absolutely no bearing on my life out here in the wilds of the Midwest, but there it was on every news channel on television and prominently displayed in my local newspaper. Chomsky argues that alternative media will lead to a greater, freer dialogue about important issues. The professor claims the alternative press might even lead to a complete overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with anarcho-syndicalism, a belief system that posits self-management, direct democracy, and working class solidarity. This political system sounds like communism, doesn't it? Well, I really don't think Chomsky is a communist, but I simply don't trust anarcho-syndicalism. At one point in the documentary, the professor avers that there are no perfect solutions to our problems and that we should all at least try his theory. One presumes that if we don't like it, all we need to do is say so, right? Wrong. Revolutions don't work that way. Replacing one political system with another tends to be quite messy, and telling the new masters that you just don't think you can go along with them always seems to lead to the behavior we saw in Stalinist Russia. Chomsky's promise that his new order will be open to different ideas doesn't satisfy this cynic. I am not ready for a cure that might be worse than the disease.
Overall, ""Manufacturing Consent"" left me unsatisfied. In an attempt to cover as much ground as possible, the filmmakers never provided as much depth to Chomsky's theories as I would have liked. Obviously, I could buy the book and see for myself exactly what the professor's arguments are, but you would think a nearly three hour documentary could provide a better presentation of this man's beliefs. As for the DVD, the picture and sound are good and there are several lengthy extras consisting of debates Chomsky had with Michel Foucault and William Buckley. Noam Chomsky comes across as an accessible, likeable guy who really cares about social problems, and I agree with most of what he is saying.

This DVD is a wonderful introduction to Noam Chomsky, his political views, and his theories of media propaganda. You should know that this is not a Noam Chomsky produced film. This is a documentary about Noam Chomsky by people that of course support his views.
Although it says ""DVD release date 2002"" above, you should realize that this film is kinda old.

Of course I was loving every minute of it. Buy it, make yourself some coffee, and watch it alone.
One more thing: Although this is no substitute for Noam Chomsky's book of the same title, this is also an excellent source of the basic ideas in the book.

  It includes excerpts from interviews in the mass media, it shows clearly how a televised opinion program for example, is set up in a way where the dissident opinion is given an extremely limited participation, which obviously obstaculize the interviewee's further explanation about the arguments expressed, with the whole purpose of creating controversy among an skeptical public already subjected through a ""manufacturing consent"" process, namely, a mediated-oriented brainwashing which purpose is not to question power.
The film also shows the level of a very consistent and political correctnes that Chomsky has impresively kept thanks to his extensive documentation and knowledge on various fields of history, political economy and foreign policy.

623778,3,6303295576,"Noam Chomsky is a revolutionary linguist whose ideas about how language structures are learnt by people led him into thinking about the workings of the mass media.  His findings radicalised him politically, and he because the most famous counter-cultural academic in the US, a leading anti-Vietnam activist, and consistently critical of US foreign policy.  To simplify his argument would be to fall into the 'soundbite' or 'concision' traps set by the media that he talks about, but basically, he suggests that the mass media, owned by a handful of major corporations whose representatives hold major decision-making positions in the American government, manipulate and deliberately limit the information the public receives.  Exhaustive research has shown him that the leading newspapers and TV stations toe the government line, giving much space to the subjects it wants promoted, and little or none at all to matters it wants kept secret or to which it is hostile.  This, of course, means a silencing of dissent or alternative voices, but it also means the business of power (and potential corruption) is kept private.
The most powerful example he gives concerns two atrocities that took place in Asia in the 1970s.  One was the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia, which led to the genocide of a third of the indigenous population, the massacring of dissidents (including foreign journalists), the systematic destruction of millenia-old ways of life, and the enforced plantation of Indonesian settlers.  The second was the Khmer Rouge terror in Cambodia.  Because Indoneia were allies with America, the first invasion and genocide was ignored by the US media - especially the inconvenient fact that the US had asked the Indonesians to delay the invasion, so that a Presidential visit to the region wouldn't be unduly embarrassing.  Because the Khmer Rouge were linked to the Soviets, endless column inches were devoted to their tyranny, with statistics distorted, photos staged and lies made fact.  Chomsky argues that from Vietnam through Central America to the Gulf War, the media are, under the terms of the Nuremberg trials, as complicit in war crimes as the forces that carried out the killings, either by evasion or propaganda [with the subsequent explosion of the Internet and the current 'war' on 'terror', we have our own opportunity to put Chomsky's theories into practice].
This nexus carries over all aspects of American life, from domestic government to civil rights to sport (the latter is inculcated at an early age to encourage submission to authority, the group and jingoism!).  Chomsky shows how the manipulation of the media is also crucial in the construction of history - the major source of historical record in the States are back issues of the New York Times, making today's lies tomorrow's facts.  The situation seems bleak, but Chomsky sees some hope in the activities of protest groups and alternative media who try to bring to light news suppressed by the mainstream.  But, he concedes, the dedication and energy needed for such a task will find few takers in the general populace.
'Manufacturing Consent' is basically a collection of interviews and talks given by Chomsky throughout his career, elucidiating his main arguemtns, with archive footage used not only as biography, but as 'evidence' for these arguments.  Chomsky is always articulate and convincing, and films about ideas, being so rare, are always fresh and fascinating.
Nevertheless, I had problems with this documentary - it was clearly aimed at teachers and students - important points and phrases are helpfully highlighted as in a lecture: I was watching the film because my wife was doing an essay on the mass media, and she was dutifully taking notes.  Not only does this give students an excuse to themselves adapt soundbites rather than read the 400 page book of the same title, but it limits or alienates any other type of viewer.  This kind of elitism extends not only to Chomsky's dubious panegyrics to 'ordinary' people, but in the way the film never questions Chomsky, his findings or his methodology - the section on East Timor is constructed in the same way as a mainstream TV report, but we're expected to believe THIS because it's from OUR side.  Chomsky manufactures our consent for his ideas.  Opponents are set up to be proved wrong.  There is someting humourless, sanctimonious and monotonous about the subject's energy, heroic and necessary though he clearly is.  His theories offer no possibility of play, difference or personal maneouvring by audiences within the mass media, such as we find in the French critical theory of the period - there is no place here for sexuality, desire or role play (although Chomsky's resemblance to Hugh Hefner led me on the oddest trains of thought).
The most shocking, though relieving, moment in the film was the sequence on the controversy over a French historian, in which Chomsky signed a petition for a Holocaust denier, demanding his civil rights and writing a paper on freedom of speech in his defence.  Some cretins, of course, confused this with supporting the historian's poisonous views.  Many slurs and slanders were hurled against Chomsky during the controversy.  What was shocking  but relieving was the revelation that Chomsky bowed to pressure and asked that his paper not be published with the infamous book.  So the saint has flaws after all.",1017273600,57,5414,5.112244897959184

Very few intellectuals tell the plain truth like this guy. He's extremely down to earth and just decent. The video is a bit long at times but there's plenty of fascinating material in it. He explains how the media tries to dupe us and keep us atomized.

There are a few reviewers here that are dead set against Chomsky (for various political reasons) and have given all materials related to him bad reviews.....see it and make up your own mind. You can often find it at a local library or if they don't have it, ask them to bring it in. That way you won't have to commit to anything.....and then if you do like it then buy it. Please note, it is long and rather harsh if you are not use to documentaries.
Manufacturing Consent is the best documentary I have ever seen. It gave me a better understanding of the so-called ""free-world"" and provided ""a course of intellectual self-defense"" as Chomsky is quoted a saying. Created by Mark Achbar, Peter Wintonick, this documentary exposes the direct relationship between democracy and propaganda. It goes a little overboard covering the life of Noam Chmosky but if you have never heard of him then its a great intro. The directors have used techniques that are often used in the mainstream media in order to show how manipulation works....so look for those and see how many you can spot.

623832,5,6303295576,"This video is extremely well made and a perfect companion to Chomsky's written work. Whether you are already a dedicated Chomskite or are new to his work this video is an objective, honest, and highly stimulating visual documentation of Chomsky's career as the leading critic of American foreign policy and Media propaganda. It is amazing how much of the 'meat' of Chomsky's institutional analysis was retained in this video. To call it merely a documentary on Chomsky, would simply not do this film justice. Visual-philosophy, yet accessible to anyone, is the defining feature of this video. This video also brings together a wealth of archival footage, much of which has not been previously available for viewing in the US, showing Chomsky in debate with everyone from Michel Foucault, on language, knowledge and power, to William F Buckley on American foreign policy. There are also excerpts from interviews with David Barsamian, as well as a very engaging and interesting integration of his works and ideas into the video format.  There are also some very enlightening examinations of the manipulation of the news, by the New York Times, and other mass media conglomerates, as well as a stirring expose on the Genocide In East Timor, which occurred around 1975 and how it was systematically ignored by the major media of the US.  This is a two-video set and is well worth the price. There is such a wealth of knowledge that this is a must for anyone interested in Noam Chomsky, American foreign policy, proaganda, or the workings of the major media. Watch this video and you will find out why, outside the US, where he is practically silenced by the corporate media, he is considered one of the most profound and important thinkers of the twentieth century. Open your mind to Chomsky and reality will never be seen in the same way again.",974332800,23,1841,4.897435897435898

623834,5,6303295576,"This is one of the most influential documentaries I've ever seen. It has affected my life in ways I never imagined; like reading Walden or Catcher in the Rye in high school.
It's very difficult to rebuke what Dr. Chomsky  says and writes. He backs up his views with miles of objective research  (although even he may claim that no source is truly objective). He spoke of  East Timor in the 70's. Perhaps you recall sound bites about the  atrocities, which finally became ""public"" in about 1999.
But  Manufacturing Consent sticks to media influence; how corporations control  the media, and that the media is not free speech since it's owned by  corporations. The New York Times will print what is in the interest of The  New York Times.
Government will suppress news in its best interest. This  is only considered a ""fact"" if one looks historically. We laugh  at the inane propaganda of early newsreels, but is World News Tonight any  different? Will it cover mass genocide in other countries without previous  consent or some agenda? No. If the US backs the current regime, chances are  you won't hear about any problems in, say, some small country near  Indonesia, or in Africa.
There's so much to say about Chomsky, but I must  end. See this film, even if you hate it. It will make you think. You may  just think Chomsky's a paranoid nut, but at least it made you think. And  it's harder to question an MIT scholar (who just so happens to also be the  most important figure in Linguistics) than, say, a commentator with a  degree in Communications.",958348800,164,1551,4.656826568265683
623835,5,6303295576,"I must recommend this documentry to everyone.  Although I had read a book of Chomsky's (Secrets, Lies and Democracy) I never fully understood his views.  That is, until I saw this film.  I then began asking myself certain  questions.  Why had I never learned about dissenters (i.e. Chomsky, Zinn)  in public high school or read about them in a paper?  Or for that matter  why was ""mainstream"" politics and the media that  ""covered"" it so exclusionary?  That is, why does the media never  fully investigate dissenting voices.  This film is a wonderful introduction  to the tireless work of Chomsky.  Humorous, brilliant, and caring, he is a  truly an inspirational figure.  In short, go out and get this film, you  will not regret it.",947635200,8,733,4.829268292682927
623836,5,6303295576,"Noam Chomsky is great. Not since John Dewey have I read someone so passionate about holistic scholarship in the humanities. Still, there are a lot of facts that need to be brought up to date with these tapes. Just to  name a few - more advances have been made in the area of animal cognition  than what was shown. Also, media conglomerates are of course much larger  than what was presented. Other excerpts were also incorrect since they were  from the 1960's, 70's, etc...the facts were just out of date and have been  proven false with new research. And not to nitpick but the East Timor case  is old and it only makes a skeptic wonder if any of it has any validity -  pick up the New York Times and it's really easy to read about what's going  on now of days. Also, take the WTO incident - that, for the most part was  covered objectively and just about all sides were heard. There seems to be  more of this kind of objective style prevailing in the 90's and a promise  of it for the future. My last criticism is that, personally, I was left with  the impression that he's coming across with a conspiracy theory. He says in  the tape and in his writings that of course he isn't - but I'm just saying  that he really gives off the impression. The majority of American media is  of course regulated by market forces since no one particular individual or  group is in control. The main focus of the media conglomerates, as with any  corporation, is to make profit for the management and for the shareholders.  The whole idea of these corporations manipulating the masses just like  elite groups in the past would also manipulate is a somewhat paranoid. I'd  suggest reading an old classic by Herbert Marcuse if you get a chance,  ""One-Dimensional Society."" It'll show how decisions in an  industrial society aren't just made by individuals but made because of the  design of the system we create itself (i.e., a market system, etc.). On the  positive side, the tapes are ingeniously presented and it's a great summary  of Noam and his work. If you're a fan, you'll love these tapes!",945216000,,2082,4.517426273458445

623838,1,6303295576,"This video of Noam Chomsky's ideas on the media is intended to serve three purposes: 1) to argue for Chomsky's ideas on media misreporting of the news, 2) to provide a biography of the man himself, and 3) to present an alternative to mainstream media. The film is well done from a production point of view, but as an argument it falls short of its goals. The first and most important goal of the film is to suport Chomsky's arguments about the media portrayal of foreign affairs. He claims the media does not report on certain items that the US Government does not wish them to report. Its an interesting thesis, and certainly provocative. We might expect the author to provide both quantitative and qualitative data to support his claim. There is no attempt whatsoever to provide a large empirical sample, however. Qualitatively there is only one example-the media's lack of reporting of the US backed Indonesian government's savage war in East Timor. Chomsky argues that since the Indonesian military was waging a genocidal war against the native population, the media did not report it since it was rather embarrassing to the US. Furthermore, the US supported the Indonesian policy for economic reasons, which the US did not want to be made public.  This interpretation falls short on many levels. The situation began in 1975 with the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, and its subsequent attempts to repress the freedom movement there.  The Ford Administration was in fact disgusted by the naked aggression undertaken by the Suharto regime. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger stated that although the US did not like the violence perpetrated by the Indonesian Government, it really had no choice but to support them.  The reason, however, was not economic, but military.  With the Cold War against the Soviets raging around the globe, the US could not risk sending Indonesia to the Soviet camp by not supporting them because of the human rights abuses in East Timor. The US thus continued to support its Indonesian ally, sending them arms, some of which were used in East Timor.  Twenty-two years later, however, the global political environment had changed. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US did not need to support Indonesia as an anti-Communist bulwark. Indonesia had also been infected by the Asian flu in 1997, and seemed unstable politically and economically in 1999, when the US changed its policy on East Timor. As the Indonesian military stepped up its violence against the native population, the atrocities grew worse.  The US government no longer needed Indonesia as an ally, and could now stop support for them based solely on their human rights abuses. Thus arms shipments were stopped, and the US supported UN intervention, as well freedom for the local populace. All of this was splashed across the headline of every major newspaper in August of 1999, contrary to what Chomsky may have predicted. Thus, the one case he uses to prove media bias does not work. The film does provide a good biography of the man and his ideas, and it also seeks to promote alternative media as well. But neither of these seems worthwhile when the one case he uses is disproved.",938390400,20,3196,4.909259259259259
