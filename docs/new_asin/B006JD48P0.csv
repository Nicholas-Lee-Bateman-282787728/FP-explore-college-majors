4992998,5,B006JD48P0,"Some kids are on their way on vacation through the backwoods of Louisiana. They stop at a local general store and the most normal person in the place is Sid Haig. One of the kids steals a picture and they decide to detour to a local attraction only to find out it is a trap! And there is a twist!

For those love those 80's style horror movies with bad monsters, nudity, pretty foul mouthed redheads, funny dialouge, rubber monsters,and quirky characters, this your 5 star cult masterpiece. Better than Lake Placid 3! Not for everyone, but if you like Haig's other work, worth a view.

F-bomb, sex, full frontal nudity.",1327276800,9,619,4.5675675675675675
4992999,2,B006JD48P0,"This is your average Scyfy movie.  No better, no worse.  Judge for yourself.  My own opinion is it is a subpar man in a rubber suit horror movie were the climax happened offscreen.  It also has a kind of wussy monster since over a minute of slow motion pummeling didn't really affect the hero.  You do get a little sleepy lesbian action but this movie really is nothing special.  This review is also of the movie.  I hope the DVD offers something else of interest to warrant a purchase (like deleted scenes, alternate scenes, ""How the heck we were able to get Sid Haig mini-feature, etc.)",1327104000,12,588,4.490566037735849

So, was the CREATURE itself a good use of latex? Yes! LOCKJAW is a well-designed, hideous critter that actually works. He / it looks great roaming through the nocturnal swampland, menacing nosey young people. As for the humans, well..., you get your typically beautiful youths, terrorized by LOCKJAW and the usual inbred-types. Still, Sid Haig is his usual, hilarious self!

This is not high budget but they did do a good job with what they were given.",1390262400,2,392,4.614285714285714
4993017,5,B006JD48P0,I enjoy a good horror movie. I don't enjoy a movie with a lot of guts and gore. But a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat is my cup of tea. This was one of those good movies.,1380672000,2,184,3.4047619047619047
4993018,2,B006JD48P0,"This flick is like an homage to 80s campy horror.  The story is laughably dumb, the monster isn't credible (even for B-horror), and every female member of the cast gets naked.  That said, I was transported to my mother's basement and a teenage state of mind that allowed me to enjoy this for what it is, a deliberately campy horror flick.

In the spirit of good taste and classic horror campiness, this movie follows in the bold footsteps of The Funhouse (1981) and Of Unknown Origin (1983) by opening with a gratuitous nudity scene.  Not just a couple nips either; you see EVERYTHING.  I think I could see her uterus.  LMFAO.  After what felt like minutes of watching this beautiful woman swimming naked in a swamp--who does that anyway--she comes to a gruesome end.

Needless to say, I'm not expecting much from a movie that resorts to such tactics.  But, then again, both The Funhouse (1981) and Of Unknown Origin (1983) did the same thing and they turned out to be great (as far as low budget 80s horror goes).

Following the classic Wrong Turn/Hills Have Eyes/Texas Chainsaw formula, a group of six twenty-somethings (three couples) are on a road trip and, just like The Cabin in the Woods taught us, meet the harbinger of bad things to come but don't bat an eye at him.  In this case, the harbinger is cameo'd by Sid Haig (Galaxy of Terror, Lords of Salem) and his backwater gas station shop workers.  Pruitt Taylor Vince (Identity, Constantine) plays another of the local crazies.

Our attractive victims include Mehcad Brooks, Serinda Swan, Amanda Fuller, Aaron Hill, Lauren Schneider and Dillon Casey...oh, and a lot of their skin.

So what's hunting our attractive cast?  Some mutated alligator man of Louisiana bayou folklore complete with a flashback backstory for an extra bit of flavor.  It's lame, but I'm entertained nonetheless.  It's stupidity actually functions as its charm.

Our cast make their way to the scariest cabin in the woods since the Evil Dead cabin.  Of course, they decide to spend the night.  However, I maintain that any other stylish group of people like these would decide to sleep in the car over a filthy, decrepit, moss-covered lean-to of a shanty house.  At this point our alligator man isn't sure if he's supposed to kill them.  But then they started drinking and smoking pot, so...yeah, according to the Horror Movie Playbook now he knows to kill them.  Throw in some drunk girl on girl action and you know they're goners!

As for the monster, we never see much of it in the first half of the movie.  Instead, we see something out of focus move in the background, a close-up of a monstrous claw, some blood splashes on the wall and then, finally, a bAloody claw.  It's typical low budget fare.  When we are graced with full body shots of the monster, it's during ill-lit night scenes to mask the ""guy in the rubber suit"" monster make-up.  The rubber suit is pretty bad.  Needless to say, I wasn't at all impressed with the effects.  I've seen much better work on ScyFy's Face Off.

But don't worry, they make up for that with a tragically awful ending.

Let's face it.  This wasn't good.  But I was actually entertained by how classically not good it was.",1367798400,,3198,4.682226211849192
4993019,1,B006JD48P0,Movie was terrible. I have seen more scary stuff on Spongebob. The creature looks bad and the plot was worse. Total waste of money and time.,1366934400,,140,4.423076923076923
4993020,3,B006JD48P0,"its cheep and creep but whats new for low budget flicks you get a guy in a foam suit lookin  like a guy in a foam suit, if they at least had a bit more nudity, but the naked girls is the only thing remotely saving this cheeser !.",1365379200,,229,3.673469387755102
4993021,4,B006JD48P0,"This is an old school 80s type horror flick that uses practical gore effects and a creature that isn't CGI. The monster is a guy in a creature costume and it looks great, and the film style might appeal to fans of 70s and 80s horror. The film deals with an incestuous relationship between a brother and sister. When the brother's bride (his sister) is killed and eaten by a monster alligator, the guy finds the alligator in its cavern. He then kills the alligator and eats everything in the creatures cave and this includes his sisters remains. When he does this, this somehow transforms him into an alligator man monster, and he still roams the swamps and forests. When a small group of people venture into his area, he begins knocking them off along with others that are around there.

This film has a pretty good plot. It's got nudity, plenty of violence, and it gets kind of funny and sleazy at times when it deals with that backwoods incestuous family line. The film is easy to follow, but it does get a little talky at times during the first half of the film. Later on, the films pace really picks up and it gets fast and exciting; although some may be bored a little before then because of some talky parts that some may think are unnecessary. If the entire movie had the fast pace that occurs later on, it would've been a much better film. If you want sex and nudity, it has some good scenes. There's a full frontal scene in the beginning, as well as some topless scenes that includes a lesbian scene. As for the gore, the goriest scene in the film is the flashback part involving the alligator eating the bride in the cavern, but some may disappointed because the movie doesn't maintain this level of gore throughout the film. The body count is good, but some deaths are off screen; and with some of the other kills, you get to see some blood but not a lot. The movie has good scenery and atmosphere, and the directing and acting are pretty good. Some mainstream horror fans might like it and some won't, but I think the film is geared more towards fans of 70s and 80s horror.

 The DVD quality looks great. The brightness is fine, and it has excellent color, contrast, and sharpness. The DVD also has animation and music with its menu and chapter stops.",1364428800,2,2263,4.448192771084337

4993025,3,B006JD48P0,"Here's one of those movies I just WANTED to love!

My wife and I rushed out to see this in the theater - as we're big fans of indie horror and all things Sid Haig (ever since his classic nearly no-spoken-lines turn in ""Galaxy of Terror"").

This was a huge letdown.

The story gets in the way of the creature's mythology (man is it convoluted by the end) - and the attack sequences feature little-to-no gore (a no-no for an R rated film in this genre). They also shoot around the nudity in an (extremely) forced opening sequence that's played straight - which involves a girl skinny dipping in a swamp(!!!).

We figured a ""Manigator"" (sorry - we're big fans of ""Matinee"") type feature would at LEAST be fun - but this was also not the case. There was nothing throwback about it. Just 90+ minutes of dialogue with an occasional off-screen kill.

A real shame too.

The only reason we rated it 3 stars instead of 2 was for the fact the makers of this tiny film pushed so hard and were able to book it into 2,000 screens without major studio support (a serious accomplishment).

At least the bayou served for a nice atmospheric back-drop; and the cinematography was serviceable. The monster looks okay as well - and it got another point for a guy in a rubber suit over the (preferred) modern CGI.

Still - unless you're a horror fanatic/completist - avoid.",1349654400,,1352,4.489795918367347

4993027,2,B006JD48P0,They really ruined this movie with a bad plot. Its hard to follow. So one of the kids is related to the weird swamp people? And one of the girls was his sister? And she gave him a lil somethin somethin? This movie would have been better off by just sticking to a much simpler storyline. It had some potential. The main actor was honestly not half bad. Everyone else besides Sid Haig were complete trash.,1343779200,,403,4.315789473684211
4993028,1,B006JD48P0,"Creature is a monster/horror film that I strongly dislike. Like some reviewers mentioned before, if you're looking for a good B-movie, watch Hatchet. This one felt like it was trying too hard. A decent monster design. Very bad storytelling. A generic cast, some bad acting, and some very annoying characters; also, how do you get shot in the leg then run through the forest at full speed? Or get your foot chopped off for no specific reason and barely react? The ending was also very drawn out and weak.

If you don't take it seriously then maybe you can enjoy it and have a couple laughs with some friends (about the quality). Looking for a great modern monster film? Check out Sector 7. This movie is available on Netflix Streaming as of 7/17/12, watch it there before even considering directly paying for it.

This movie has a lot of full nudity and sex (and monster nudity), and violence and gore.",1342483200,,901,4.625
4993029,3,B006JD48P0,"If you are interested in this monster movie, you've probably been drawn to it by its reputation as a bad B-list ""Black Lagoon"" remake.

4993030,2,B006JD48P0,"Wow! What an upsetting letdown. Filmmaker Fred Andrews spent a lot of time viewing Adam Green's ""Hatchet"" in order to co-write and direct this 93 minute borefest. ""Creature"" steals ideas from ""Hatchet"" and creates a villain nicknamed Lockjaw, a half-man/half-alligator, who's on the prowl for a new bride and killing everybody along the way, and guess what? He's got a back story just like Victor Crowley! Except Lockjaw's is just plain stupid. And guess what else? It's set in a Louisiana swamp. The deaths are a splash of blood here, a splash of blood there, camera illusion here, camera illusion there so don't expect much direct violence. You'd think also a film about silly teenagers camping in a Louisiana swamp and meeting face to face with Lockjaw would be the main story. Wrong! Instead, Fred Andrews tossed in a ridiculous subplot about an incest clan sacrificing women to the creature because he's considered a God who ""protects them"". On a positive note, it was a breath of fresh air to see an actor in a monster costume instead of a creature weighed down with CGI. Sid Haig and a mild girl-on-girl scene also save it from going in the garbage.",1335744000,,1156,4.785
4993031,5,B006JD48P0,"Creature-2011 took me to bloody Heaven. Creature meets-jour picture expectations and exceeds them.

Creature is an unexpected ample, fulfilling treat. The legend of gluttonous Lockjaw, the terror with teeth, provides ambrosial pabulum for any horrorhead. Hell, other film fans might relish it too. Creature is an infamous cineplex flop, for hardly anyone partook. But, screw the sizzle, son. This meaty piece has steak. And, alligator god Lockjaw deserves a cult following. Eat it up on DVD dee-rectly.

Creature has all of the ingredients that a genre fan could crave. This cut is one beautiful hard-R. This horror tale had all of the goodies in plenty, plus some surprises. I am not even going into detail, not going to flesh things out. I want potential viewers shocked, amazed, and satisfied like they are when watching for the first time 2001 Maniacs, The Devil's Rejects, or Piranha 3D. Or, this Louisiana gator tale's freaky cousin Hatchet. I want horror followers to testify ""Holy crap! I didn't know that they made such films anymore! It's the drive-in in the privacy of my own home."" And, this film looks great. Before the camera are Sid Haig (the man, the legend), Pruitt Taylor Vince (Constantine), Amanda Fuller (Red, White, & Blue), Lauren Schneider (also Red, White, & Blue), and Serinda Swan (Smallville). Everyone else is good too. (BTW, Swan resembles Megan Fox so strongly that I was sure that she was Fox under a different name; she even has a tatoo of script along her side; but, imdb indicates separate identities).

I can see why the box-office was disastrous, being that it got absolutely no press prior to its release. Also, the biggest name attached to it is Sid Haig, who has mostly been in b-movies, many of them going to direct-to-dvd, which is probably what Creature should've done. It's not bad, but it's no better or distinguished that most of the Sy-fy original movies. It does deliver the exploitation goods, though. It has enough nudity and gore to satisfy. What it lacks is originality and a sense of real fun.",1335139200,,652,4.728070175438597

CREATURE is allegedly the worst box-office disaster in modern cinema and universally reviled by pro critics and reviewers like us.  The cliches are all included:  the inter-racial lovebirds; the requisite lesbian segment' incestuous rednecks; and six friends running around doing stupid things.  Mehcad Brooks (TRUE BLOOD's doomed Eggs Benedict) leads the charge as the ex-Navy Seal who ends up a bloody mess, but heroic nonetheless.  Sid Haig and Pruitt Taylor Vince try gamely but the rest of the cast is just around to supply the copious body count.  The twist at the end is a little surprising but inevitable.

8499367,1,B006JD48P0,"Essentially a remake of ""Night of the Demon,"" this film has horrible acting, lousy dialog, and pathetic special effects. The giant, white, rubber alligator is embarrassing beyond words. Lots of '70's and '80's creature features were unintentionally bad, but they at least tried. Lately, self-aware films like ""Creature"" have been churned out by ""filmmakers"" who sit with a checklist of cliches and tropes and meticulously tivk them off. Pointless nudity? Check. Lame sexual overtones? Got 'em! People that act unlike anybody in the real world? All set! Cheesy monster that looks like a comic book super hero instead of a mutant or man-animal? Nailed it! Model-looking cast? Hey, we got us a movie!!! But not really. Instead, what we have here is a collection of cliches and a waste of 90 minutes or so. Skip it and watch the grass grow instead. It'll cost less and be less damaging to your brain cells.",1480809600,2,902,4.901960784313726
