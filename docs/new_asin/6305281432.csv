7887993,4,6305281432,Yes indeed it is out on DVD and it is a hoot. Most Troma films try so hard to be cheap and fail miserably because they actually are cheap piles of crap but this one is different. The acting is decent and the humor is relentless. The West Virginia setting is great too. A fun movie for everyone.,1424736000,,294,4.086206896551724

7887995,4,6305281432,"I first found out about this film from a poster which used to hang upon one of the stars' office wall, and I must say this movie has become a guilty pleasure.  True, the performances are cheesy (shows that even the best stage actors - such as I know they are - can have trouble transferring to film), and they make the writing seem like Shakespeare, but it is simply a cute little comedy.",996883200,4,388,4.243243243243243
7887996,4,6305281432,"Back in the late 1980s when I was a news reporter for West Virginia Public Radio, I did a story about the filming of this little gem. I made the acquaintance some of the stars, and I even got to be an extra! To be honest, this is no visionary cinematic masterpiece. The special effects are cheap and the acting is goofy. But it was a labor of love for a little band of filmmakers shooting just a few miles from where I live, so I can't help but be biased.",986515200,4,455,4.010989010989011
