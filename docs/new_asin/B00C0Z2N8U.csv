8576073,1,B00C0Z2N8U,"I purchased the book & didn't get to read it before loaning out to a friend.  Decided to purchase this CD as I believed it was the audio for the book.  I felt deceived as it was no more than a really poor quality Disc of a sermon.  I've seen better YouTube videos about the Harbinger than this sermon by the author!  The prophecy and story line have value and certainly hit the nail on the head that America is in deep trouble!  I would suggest that you google YouTube for the harbinger other than purchasing this overly copied, bad quality disc!",1392854400,3,546,4.313725490196078
8576074,5,B00C0Z2N8U,We had heard several comments about the Harbinger and was very curious.  My husband and I feel it is prophetic and really feel concern for our nation.  I thank the author for bringing this out in the light and believe it is truth that all people need to learn about.  I pray we do not lose sight of the purpose for this nation.  I hope we can repent and again find grace before time passes and it is too late to salvage what would please God..,1390780800,,443,4.116279069767442

From begining to end, this DVD will have the Faithful on the edge of their seats. Anyone can read a K.J.V. Bible, But there are very few "" Outsiders"" that can understand what they have read. This DVD, THE HARBINGER #1, Is the first in a series, that reveals the FACTS that many have searched for yet never found. As For those Outside the Faith, They to should read this report.
This would be a Great item to add to your Bible Study Group, Enjoy.",1378944000,2,582,5.550561797752809

8576079,5,B00C0Z2N8U,"I couldn't stop watching the DVD. Very clear explanations. Makes you think and realize that God is speaking to us, warning us thru the Bible and the Prophets. The Signs are there as the Rabbi presented them. We need to take time from our busy lives and listen to God speaking to us. Thank you Rabbi  for this DVD presentation for all who believe in God. Jesus is with you and all of us thru these end times. We need to Trust Him.",1376092800,,429,4.168674698795181
