2431617,5,B000BO0L0E,"I loved the beautiful scenes, music and narration in this video!  It showed me Hawaii's top beaches, the most famous places to surf, the shopping and nightlife, stunning mountains that are over 2 miles high and even where Hawaii's king's ruled. A book only gives you a vague idea of what to see, but after watching this I know exactly where I want to go on each island.  I'm using this travel guide to plan my first trip and I can't wait for this vacation of a lifetime!",1179705600,28,470,4.329545454545454
2431618,3,B000BO0L0E,"I agree the DVD doesn't seem to have cost much money for those who produced it .The voice and the music on it are not the best and often seem boring,but the views of Hawaii are breathtaking and I can recommend this DVD for those who are planning their trip to Hawaii to get an idea what is worth seeing their.

2431622,5,B000BO0L0E,"I grew up on the east coast and hadn't been to Hawaii and didn't know what to expect. This video was an excellent way to see what Hawaii has to offer from its beautiful beaches to its explosive volcanoes and rich culture. And the range of the music is astonishing - it reflects the diverse cultures of Hawaii (over half are of Asian descent), including Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Polynesians, etc. In addition, Hawaii has amazing natural wonders from mountains to tropical rainforests, beaches and coral reefs and the music captures the moods for the landscapes. I counted almost 20 different songs and I tried to summarize some of the music below:

1 - Popular Hawaiian music with guitars and Ukuleles for the Hula, plus traditional Hawaiian chants.

2- Peaceful new age and avant-garde music to capture the mystical nature of sites like Iao Valley and Mt. Haleakala, which is over 10,000 feet high.

3- Rock n roll to reflect the excitement of surfing, swimming and sailing.

4- Tropical Latin music with Trumpets, Timbales and Brass captures Honolulu's exciting nightlife.

5- There is classical music with Flutes, Piccolos, and Harps, which reflects the majesty of underwater sea life including coral and beautiful fish.

6- And to mirror the diversity of Hawaiians, there is Polynesian music, country bluegrass with dueling banjos (surprise -- Hawaii has one of the largest cattle ranches in the USA), soul music, and even some swing music for nostalgia.

7- Pearl Harbor's music conveys a shocking anxious tone as it shows historical footage of the attack.

8- And there is supernatural music for the ancient Hawaiian sites, suspenseful music for the active volcanoes and tranquil music for beach scenes. The only way somebody wouldn't notice this diverse range of music would be that they didn't have their speakers on.

This video's beautiful photography and diverse music captures the heart and soul of Hawaii. And if you didn't enjoy watching it, then you might not enjoy a trip to paradise. This was a great way to plan a vacation and for only $10 - it's a steal - get it!",1167955200,20,2086,4.92022792022792
2431623,5,B000BO0L0E,"Excellent introduction to the Hawaiian Islands.  Spectacular photography and interesting narrative.  As a former resident of Hawaii, I feel this video gives a great look at the islands and makes me want to return very soon.",1147219200,42,223,5.166666666666667

AMG said ""Travel to the breathtaking islands of Hawaii with this tropical video"" - it shows that Hawaii is a precious jewel among the 50 states.

On the other hand Globe Trekker's Hawaii DVD, from a European company, focuses on controversy rather than the sites. At a Globe Trekker related web site one forum says, ""Americans clearly hated..."" And on another forum on this site, someone asked why Globe Trekker visits countries with repressive regimes such as Iran, Cuba, etc. The response by the site administrator was unbelievable - they compared human rights in the USA versus these rogue regimes, and asked, ""Should Globe Trekker boycott it (the USA)?""

And there's plenty of controversy on Globe Trekker's Hawaii DVD, i.e. they talk about eating dogs (real dogs not hot dogs), they discuss the sovereignty movement (some Hawaiians want to separate from the U.S.), and they show a bull castration - probably not what you're looking for on a vacation.

We only watched Globe Trekker's video because it was promoted on Amazon. If you want a spectacular travel guide, that's a lot of fun, without any hidden agendas get our DVD ""Hawaii: Oahu, Maui, Kauai & The Big Island"".

2431625,4,B000BO0L0E,"When you are packing your bags for Hawaii, you might want to see this first, even if it is a mixed bag. First the negatives: the voice quality of the narration and the script. On the other hand it does show the first time visitor places and things that aren't always shown on other disks. In fact as someone who's been going for over thirty years I saw a few things I've missed. So, considering the fact this is an inexpensive disk, I'd say go ahead and get it.",1137801600,60,461,4.191011235955056

This is one of the WORST DVD's I have seen on Hawaii and would not recommend to anyone.  They really don't portray it properly.  For example, while showing Waikiki, they failed to even show the Royal Hawaiian which is one of the more famous places there.  Plus the skip all over and back and forth.  No theme.  Do not buy - you will be disappointed.

I sure would like my money back!",1421884800,2,475,4.258426966292135

2431633,1,B000BO0L0E,"Regrettably this DVD was a real disappointment and failed to capture the great beauty and unique enchantment of the Hawaiian Islands.  It was like someone read a travel book, noted popular points of interest, spliced together file footage and then added a narrative.  It left me with the feeling that firsthand travel experience to Hawaii was not involved in the making of this DVD.  You can compare it to going to a restaurant based on a rave review (which it turned out was written by the restaurant itself [the description that promoted this DVD]) and discovering that the food came out of cans and jars and was heated in a microwave oven.",1398470400,2,642,4.714285714285714

Since I've been there a few times and my husband never has, I wanted us to watch a DVD together on Hawaii so he can see the beautiful sights we will be enjoying.  This was a wonderful overview of what he can expect to see.  We definitely enjoyed it and made our anticipation of our trip to Hawaii that much more real.",1370563200,2,403,4.207792207792208
2431640,3,B000BO0L0E,"I have mixed feelings on this video. Some of the video is great. It gives you a good tour around the islands. However, it is totally ruined by possibly, the worst voice over announcer I have ever heard! His high pitched, and nasal voiced, totally distracts from the video. Bizarre music choices also. With all of the awesome Hawaiian, Jawaiian, & Slack Key Guitar music there is to chose from, that can really capture the feel of Hawaii, & enhance the beauty of the video, I don't know why they used  some really cheesy sounding fake 50's music as the background of many scenes. If you can get past the awful audio, and also overlook the low production value, it's ok, but there are better videos out there.",1369785600,2,707,4.5234375

2431646,1,B000BO0L0E,"Because I don't like to focus on the negative I've never reviewed an item I've purchased and been unhappy with but felt compelled to do so today.

Watching the video was a struggle due to the voice of the narrator and the poorly written script. It sounds as though the script was written several decades ago and being spoken with a high pitched,  nasally voice made it rough to get through. The video spends more time than necessary on the volcanoes and giving tours of the interior of museums and inside the Parker ranch home. Seriously, who cares that there's a painting of Venice over the bed in the Venician room.

When watching a video tour of Hawaii I would hope to see more of the beaches and tropical areas and less of the camera shooting a fishtank and a wall mural of King Kamehamehaha.

Not sure this video is even worth donating to the local library.

I feel this may be a bit harsh but I'm being honest.",1359158400,16,916,4.396449704142012
2431647,2,B000BO0L0E,"We enjoyed seeing the sites we saw on our recent trip.  However, the video is VERY dated - the date stated is 1994 - 2006 for the DVD company.  I would say it was more from the mid-1990's.  It was really very
dated in dress and certainly not as very many people in the locations as there would be today.  If I wanted this to get ready for traveling there I would be disappointed and would not recommend it.
Can't say we're overwhelmed with it either.",1351036800,4,450,4.1976744186046515
2431648,2,B000BO0L0E,"the video did give some interesting information, however the film quality looked like an old super 8 movie.  Poor colour separation and saturation, grainy - almost looked like a wonderful patchwork quilt of archived travelogue footage from the 1960s.  The information on this DVD could complement the DVD ""Over Hawaii"" which has excellent cinematography and gorgeous views from the air",1333584000,4,385,5.4
2431649,1,B000BO0L0E,"There's a sucker born every minute--and I was one of them. Having been to Hawaii many times, and having been taken in by the 5-star ""reviews"" of this DVD, I actually spent my hard-earned money on it. Poor-quality stock footage; ordinary shots taken by a camera planted in one spot on a few beaches, a downtown Honolulu sidewalk, or auto turnouts on otherwise scenic roads; multiple repetitions of various setups; terrible, inappropriate musical soundtrack; amateurish, grating script and narration--our 12-year-old grandson is already producing short films that put this mess to shame. I would single out those who made this travesty by name--except that there are no production credits of any kind, either on the case or on the DVD itself.

The best part of this horrendous excuse for a travel  DVD is that my wife and I will never have to watch it again. The worst part is that, having sat through it once, we are one hour closer to the grave with nothing to show for it.",1333065600,5,973,4.7514792899408285
2431650,1,B000BO0L0E,"If you don't care about narration and music but only about the photography you might consider the $10 this DVD costs you to be a semi-fair trade.  If you like a Joe Pesci sound alike for a narrator and think 70's banal background music adds to your experience then buy this disappointing DVD.  Unfortunately, I don't have another to recommend because I just started collecting travel DVDs so I can pretend I've seen the world -- the only way I'm going to do it on my budget.  Seriously, there's just got to be something, anything, that's a better taste of Hawaii than this.  If I were in charge of tourism for Hawaii, I'd sue.",1323043200,2,626,4.464912280701754

2431652,4,B000BO0L0E,The video was really well done and opens a new world of the 50th State.  The voice over was a little scripted but if you overlook that you will find an enjoyable 60 min tour of the Islands.,1301184000,3,189,3.973684210526316
2431653,5,B000BO0L0E,Almost 60 years ago my submarine operated out of Pearl Harbor.  This excellent video reminded of Oahu's beauty and the terrific photos have encouraged me to see the other Islands in Hawaii - and I plan to do so in 2011,1289779200,3,218,4.317073170731708
2431654,1,B000BO0L0E,"This has to be one of the most annoying and terrible DVD's I have watched in a long time.  The narration is absolutely cringeworthy, boring and to be honest if this was the only thing I saw about Hawaii I might not even bother going.

Some of the camera work is not too bad but the music, dear god the music.  Who chose this drivel.  This inane, probably royalty free dross that fills in every single minute of this dreadful DVD.

There is clearly a whole in the market for some good tourist videos about Hawaii, but I have yet to find it and this certainly isn't it.  It's going straight in the bin.",1266883200,8,600,4.219298245614035

Apparently, it was made on a small budget, by some less-than-top-quality outfit. The narrator's voice is truly annoying. The ""background"" music is intrusive and almost totally inappropriate for what is going on in the video (hokey Appalachian hillbilly music for scenes of a Hawaiian cattle ranch?  - What East Coast metropolis / cave do the producers of THIS video come from, we wonder?).

Did the producer every think that Hawaiian music may be called for under the circumstance? How about blurred, what looked to be, personal photos of a few passer byes that was to represent the Honolulu night life. My family photos are better. There's also the looped footage of the Maui beaches. Same kids running down the beach though the narrator is attempting to create the impression you are somewhere other than where the production took you at the beginning of the segment.  The narrator sounds like a distant uncle narrating in the background of a family get together where we all sat back and watched our vacation on 8mm. Very annoying voice.

What's even more bizarre are the many number of 4 and 5 star reviews. Makes absolutely no sense. Folks, I give you my word that I am being generous in my brief review.

I don't review much of anything. I want to spare people who are preparing for a trip to the islands to please find something else as this is a complete utter waste of both time and money.
