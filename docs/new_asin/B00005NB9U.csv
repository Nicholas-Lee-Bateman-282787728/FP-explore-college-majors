The story begins with Manuel, a young man from the city, leaving the comfy confines of his home in Buenos Aires to look for his father. His search begins by attending a funeral where he gets an idea as to his whereabouts since he was not at the funeral. He sets out on his moto for the road to discovery. Along the way he encounters a couple of young women  who are also in search of discovery. One is a singer who leaves her band  and the other is a photographer named Carolina. The chemistry between Carolina and Manuel is the catylyst for the adventure to continue. She soon is riding with Manuel and they get in some trouble. Eventually, after various other encounters of people, who will  also play into the developing plot, he finds his dads partner who is a sage Indian. The wisdom Manuel learns from El Indio includes various lessons in life.  He imparts such wisdom like saying ""that a circle should not be left open.""  Manuel  eventually  becomes  part of a  manhunt by the police chief because he has witnessed a murder and Manuel holds the key to revealing the truth. Nothing can stop Manuel in his quest for finding his father even the police on his tail . Although he does not connect physically he learns many life lessons along the way to eventually  make a connection. If you are looking for a fast paced movie look elsewhere as this is medium paced foreign movie that is obviously made on a less than a Hollywood caliber budget. A pretty good Spanish language movie but it is less than stellar. If you like road movies than you will probably like it because of the locations, characters  and the adventures along the path to discovery.",1052697600,3,1735,4.5111821086261985

The first thing you notice about this movie is the inferior film quality. It's not too bad, but I expected better. The plot itself is interesting up until before the end. The big ""twist"" I was expecting was somewhat of a letdown.
The best parts of this movie are probably in the middle. The dance club scene manages to bring out this film's biggest strength, the chemistry between Manuel and Caro. The actress that portrays Caro is the biggest acting talent seen in this story, Ezequiel who portrays Manuel has his acting up and downs but it seems he was cast here to pull off the James Dean look which he surprisingly manages in quite a few scenes.
If you happen to stumble into an opportunity to catch this movie go ahead and watch it, but don't go out of your way to get it.",1039132800,3,919,4.380116959064328
7946618,4,B00005NB9U,"This is an Argentine movie, with a very clear plot. The performances are great and far different from the standard American Movie experience. Although it contains small violence and sex escenes, the main plot is around the feelings of a young man looking for his absent father.",1035504000,2,277,4.914893617021277
