6445033,5,B00KSEAMAG,"This is a series dedicated to describing the events leading to the outbreak of the first World War. To do this it has to take the very complicated diplomatic situation of the time and simplify it for audiences' consumption. It is to the considerable credit of the series that this simplification does not get carried too far. The various twists and turns are portrayed nearly exactly the way they occurred, and if it is possible to argue with the motivations recorded for such actions that is a matter of historical perspective.

The main lead here is Sir Edward Grey, ably played by Emperor Palpatine. Grey is the Foreign Secretary and as such was the chief British official responsible for negotiations leading up to the war. His main goal during this month (the 37 days of the title) was to get all the sides to agree to a peaceful solution, through whatever means necessary. It may seem odd to have the British viewpoint at the center given the peripheral state of the United Kingdom to these events, but their very lack of ties was what allowed them to remain a neutral party advocating for peace. Also shown is the German side, although it receives much less attention. It never really goes into Austria, France, Russia, or any of the other states, which does distort the view somewhat.

One of the highpoints of the series is seeing historical figures embodied well. As mentioned before, Ian McDiarmid makes an excellent Grey, even if they look nothing alike. Rather more accurate to history are Churchill, Lloyd George, Henry Asquith, and John Burns. They look and act the part well.

This series does make some rather odd and serious mistakes. The first of these is seen in the very beginning: they choose to ease the viewer into this world by hitching onto two minor players in these events. That sounds like a good idea, but the execution is flawed. First, they introduce them through a voice-over narration that sounds just like a docudrama and features them telling us who they are and what they believe, which feels like very much a case of telling us what's going on rather than letting us see it. It seems to display a lack of faith in the audience's ability to work things out for their own. Second, these characters have little to do with the rest of the episodes, which focus more on the main players. This makes their introductions seem not a little gimmicky while misleading the audience from the get go. Aside from that I only had two real problems with it: While the series may have made great use of exteriors the shots the camera shots remain static which leads to a claustrophobic and limited perspective. Also, the different countries all talk in heavily accented English, which bothers me when it's in a film that is trying to be as realistic as possible.

These problems, except for the first one, are rather nitpicky. On the whole I don't think that the series can be topped as a presentation of the negotiations that led to the first World War.",1409616000,30,2975,4.682600382409178
6445034,5,B00KSEAMAG,"STUMBLING INTO WAR, WAS IT EVER THUS? -- AN AMAZING HISTORICAL DRAMA AND LOOK INSIDE THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO LED THE WORLD TO WAR

***If you have not bought any of the 4 features at the following listing (also containing the above title), I recommend considering the whole package :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-War-One-Collection-4pack-Giftset-DVD/dp/B00MWGGS1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World War One Collection (4pack/ Giftset/ DVD)</a>

This exceptional look into the events that led to the First World War is fascinating because of it's perspective from the persons of power and those employed in their offices.  It is a perspective mainly from the Foreign office in Britain and the offices of the German Chancellery.  This includes the heads of those offices as well as their deputies and lower assistants.  Add to that the conversations of members of cabinet, sovereigns, and leading diplomats.  This is a full drama, but much of the dialog in this movie is reconstructed or at least based on the real missives, telegrams, and official negotiations of those involved in the diplomatic process.  So quite literally, you are seeing the inner most view of what went horribly wrong.

This is not an action piece about the start of the war.  But in spite of the very dialog driven drama, it is absolutely fascinating to look into the thought process and negotiation of these people as the rest of the world sits oblivious to the consequence of a seemingly innocuous event.  You will sit with your mouth agape as the would-be assassins fail their first attempt in Sarajevo, only to have the driver of the Arch Duke stop right in front of the coffee house where the assailant sat (I believe Princip was actually standing outside in real life), providing a second chance.  The desire of the Kaiser to push Austria into ""teaching the Serbs a lesson"", the scheming of German General Moltka as he is three steps ahead of everyone in forcing his desire for war, the political jockeying in both Germany and England to prevent other parties from having relevance by voting for shows of force in their cabinets --- all here and fascinating to observe.  Things like a simple phone call near the end from Edward Grey to the German ambassador with a misunderstood assurance that Britain will not intervene if France is not attacked, it's surreal!

It is a catastrophic sequence of events and a comedy of errors that will lead to almost 10 million military deaths and around another 20 million wounded (and this doesn't even count civilians).  Not to mention setting the scene for the later rise of the Third Reich (not a topic of this movie).  Through it all, we observe how significant parts of the process have more to do with internal posturing of political parties and individuals on each side of the Channel than it does with actual grievances.  So many, ever so many simple developments could have prevented something so huge.  It will take just 37 days to go from a prosperous world peace to one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history.

There are lots of dramas and documentaries on WWI, but there is little else out there like this.  It is a profound look.",1408233600,76,3218,5.0037523452157595
6445035,5,B00KSEAMAG,"It can seem fairly astounding that a war costing 10,000,000 lives could be ""inevitable"", but WWI is often portrayed that way. For their preliminary research for ""37 Days"", Mark Hayhurst (writer and producer) and Sue Horth (producer) put together a 175-page binder of ""every conference, every telephone call, private letter and telegram swirling around Europe"" before writing the script. Their goal, when BBC announced the series, was ""to quash assumptions about the war's inevitability"".

I just saw this amazing docu-drama, and I must admit that given the intersecting personalities involved, I am half thinking that this was a juggernaut that would have taken more than just one prime minister to derail. But then, that's usually the way. It takes two to tango.

On June 28, 1914, ArchDuke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was assassinated by a Serb in the city of Sarajevo, which is in Bosnia. Bosnia was part of the Empire; Serbia was an independent country. However, there were a lot of ethnic Serbs living in Bosnia and Serbian separatists wanted to annex part of Bosnia. Killing the heir to a country 12 times bigger than yours doesn't seem efficacious to me, but I don't have a lot of anarchist tendencies. As ""37 Days"" shows, Austria-Hungary, under 84 year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, did not rush to punish Serbia - not the least because the Serbian government had nothing to do with it.

But Kaiser Wilhelm II, furious about such regicide, was not about to allow the Empire to let Serbia off so easily. How could Prussia push around the mighty Habsburgs? After all Austria-Hungary was the 2nd largest country in Europe, after Russia. Of course, Prussia was the 3rd largest and had the largest military budget. It could be that this drama accentuates Prussia's power in this regard, deflecting blame from the Habsburgs.

The main characterization which seems over-wrought is that of Helmuth von Moltke, the Kaiser's Chief of Staff. He comes off as out-Kaisering the Kaiser in ""37 Days"". In real life, he was so upset by the fight over abandoning early troop build-up on the Western front (due, in ""37 Days"", to a messed up diplomatic phone call), that he fell ill and had to leave his position a few months later. His machinations in ""37 Days"" are riveting, even if over-drawn.

There is no doubt that the Kaiser was of a military and empire-building bent. Of course, so was England. England was hardly interested in Serbia, but it did want to keep Russia happy, to avoid having to fight Russia for India - and Russia had a treaty with Serbia. The bulk of ""37 Days"" is about the diplomatic maneuvering between Prussia, Russia, France and Great Britain, with a little sliver of poor Belgium thrown in. The to and fro would be almost comical if it didn't have such awful consequences. In one sequence, we see Sir Edward Grey, British Foreign Secretary, call in two ambassadors, one after the other, and assure each of them exactly the opposite of what he told the other.  This is just one place where the UN-inevitability of war comes in.

Another was a bit of a surprise to me. I tended to loosely think of the Kaiser as a true monarch. He actually was a constitutional monarch, and ""37 Days"" shows him on tenterhooks, waiting for the legislature to authorize the expense of his military build-up. (Not inevitable!)

There is a lot of talking around tables in ""37 Days"", but instead of dragging, this held my avid interest for 2 1/2 hours due to the very intelligent dialogue. The script, even if you question an emphasis here and there, is very well composed.

""37 Days"" is just one of the shows the BBC produced to commemorate the centenary of the start of WWI. It originally aired on TV in England in March, 2014, in three parts. I was lucky to see ""37 Days"" in a theater - the BBC is trying to broaden its U.S. base by offering select shows to be seen in theaters, generally ""art"" theaters, with free admission.
[Edited to add:] I now have my 1-disc DVD of ""37 Days"". English subtitles are available on both the DVD and BluRay. The show is presented in 16:9 in stereo. The three episodes total 159 minutes. There are no DVD/BluRay bonus extras.

I highly recommend another BBC centenary offering
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Royal-Cousins-at-War/dp/B00KSEAMT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Royal Cousins at War</a>.
I suggest watching ""Royal Cousins"" first. It is a documentary telling the personal sides of the story; the life-long interactions of George V of England, Tzar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Prussia. You will almost feel sorry for Wilhelm. Then, ""37 Days"" will disabuse you of that. Nicholas and George barely appear in ""37 Days"", so these two shows are a real contrast, adding different dimensions to my understanding of WWI - The War To End All Wars.

6445044,4,B00KSEAMAG,"This is a beautifully executed drama pointing to the folly of men that here led to horrible destruction.  Unfortunately it is not entirely accurate history.  This show places virtually the entire blame for the outbreak of World War I on Germany.  That was the generally taught American position 50 years ago.  After all, Germany's stupidity clearly led to America's entry in the war so it was an easy sale here to suggest they also were overwhelmingly responsible for starting it.  More recent scholarship, however, suggests a far more complex cause for the war than is suggested in this film.  One of the chief protagonists, the only one perhaps with a logical reason to want a war (to regain territory lost in the Franco-Prussian War) was France, and their role in precipitating the crisis is ignored in this film.  The British were not the great peacemakers that the BBC portrays.  There was a considerable war party in Britain -- it wasn't just Winston Churchill.  And, at least to 21st Century eyes, Britain, along with Russia, Germany and most of all Austria, had no logical reason to go to war -- not simply because they didn't foresee the enormous cost which is noted at the end of the final episode.

6445055,5,B00KSEAMAG,"I mentioned to another reviewer that I had seen this twice, but it's actually three times as of now, and for all its length, there's never a dull moment in this tense drama of the 37 days from the assassination of Archduke Franz-Ferdinand and the beginning of ""the war to end all wars."" I had a couple iffy moments at the beginning when my son pointed at the actor playing Edward Gray, one Ian McDiarmid, and shrieked, ""It's Emperor Palpatine, aggggghhh"" but once he settled down and we were able to actually watch the show, we both forgot all about Star Wars.

The miniseries is done in two parts, each probably an hour and a half in length, but it doesn't feel that long, and at the end of the first part I was not inclined to take a break; I wanted to find out what happened next. I already knew, of course, but it didn't matter; I wanted to see it.

It's told both from the British perspective and the German perspective, by two minor clerks in their respective Foreign Offices, each watching the important players as the action unfolds. You get the notion that each becomes more and more weighted down by a giant lead ball in the gut as he witnesses the arrogance, miscalculations, and sometimes even bad phone connections pile up to turn a national tragedy into an international bloodbath. Each dispatch, each telegram, each meeting of the Kaiser with his staff or the British cabinet becomes more tense. And you keep thinking, ""there's got to be a way out of this."" And with the cliched 20/20 hindsight, we know that each way out of it only led to a dead end. I kept wanting to grab Ranier Sellien (who played Kaiser Wilhelm) and jack-slap him about four or five times. (Which brings me to another point: Palpatine notwithstanding, the casting on this is great).

I don't watch a television show or movie more than a couple of times unless it really grips me, but I know I'll be watching this one again. Maybe today, because just thinking about it while reviewing it made me want to see it again.",1461283200,4,2003,4.497252747252747

6445060,5,B00KSEAMAG,"Fascinating depiction of key players. Edward Grey, Crowe, Churchill, Lloyd George, Kaiser, Molkte, Tsar, Emperor Franz Joseph,  and others come to life. Even the French feelings are shown by presenting Cambon, the French ambassador, enraged.

The focus is on the English and the Germans. The conflict among both groups create tension and interest. Churchill the hardheaded warrior, Grey the optimist, the Kaiser the self-centered tyrant, Molkte the arrogant military man, are all drawn with clear brush.

Nevertheless, the French, Russian, Austrian and Serbian roles are included. The Tsar, Franz Joseph, Princip the assassin all play parts.

The contrast of the British and German political systems easily seen. The British cabinet working by consensus, the German civil service required to submit to the Kaiser no matter how foolish. The Kaiser's determination to create a war for the glory of Germany (Prussia) drives the events. Molkte is even more fanatical in his lust for war. He wants war with both France and Russia at the same time. His explanation that war shows which nation (people) have the right to control reflects the dominate darwinian ethos in Germany. Might makes right.

The British worry about Russia interfering in India drives much of their decisions.

Presents many players with each having their own motives, agendas, goals and premises. The fundamental beliefs of each side fuel the motor to war. The British preoccupation with their overseas empire, the German focus on empire in Europe, French worry about German occupation,  Russian fear of German ability to mobilize, drive events.

Whoever was running this world, would need to deal with the same issues. The beliefs, need for empire, need for war, need for glory, would have to be dropped before any thing could change. This is obvious from similar ideas producing WW2.

This feels like a fine movie drama, even though it is really a documentary. The research must have been staggering. The pace is fast and the conversations fascinating. The different personalities really come to life. The different beliefs of each highlight the power of ideas. Educational and interesting!

The film ""Paris - 1919"" fits well with this one. It covers the end of the war, just as this one does the beginning.

Plan to rewatch many times. Great.",1443744000,12,2312,5.171581769436997

6445086,4,B00KSEAMAG,"After Archduke Ferdinand's assassination in Bosnia, a period of 37 days followed before the outbreak of hostilities that became known as ""the Great War"".  The only thing great about it was the human misery created by it, culminating in another World War.  This movie shows a truncated version of events that led to the not-inevitable result of war.  The views of the British and Germans are primarily presented, with minor input about the Turks.  French attitudes and actions are completely ignored in this movie, a terrible disservice to what this picture is trying to portray.  To overlook what occurred diplomatically in the nation that was the primary victim of this horrible war is incomprehensible to any student of history.  The upshot of this movie is that Kaiser Wilhelm wanted to have ""a little war"" involving Austro-Hungarian and Serbian nations fighting--i.e., ""let's you and him fight.""  This seems too simplistic attribution of such a woeful decision--even by madman (even as Hitler, the next in succession of disastrous leaders of the Reich).  Nevertheless, the movie serves as an introduction to the incubator phase of the conflict.

6445089,4,B00KSEAMAG,"A three-part, three-hour docudrama that looks at the 5+ weeks between the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 and the beginning of World War I. It's a sobering, even depressing look at mistakes, false assumptions, and failed diplomacy.
* The unbalanced Kaiser is on vacation, but still insistent on having his way, even when he can't keep current on evolving events.
* Key ministers are resigning over political differences.
* War-hungry generals assume (wrongly) that Russia won't mobilize to protect Serbia.
* The French and British bicker over what their recent Entente Cordiale requires if Germany attacks France.
* And which countries, if any, will step forward to guarantee Belgium neutrality?

The series may feel slow at times. But overall, it is compelling and exceptionally well-written and acted. (And yes, that IS Emperor Palpatine playing the British Foreign Minister)

After watching, I understand much more about the sad events and pathetic actions that launched a war where 16 million people would be killed and nobody would win.",1416528000,,1071,5.294117647058823
6445090,5,B00KSEAMAG,"Stunning for American amateur history buffs. A wonderful tribute to the awful event of 100 years ago.  I had to watch all 3 episodes  and found myself caught up in the hope of resolution without war.  The reviews on line carp about the filming in Belfast.  Churchill and the Foreign secretary seemed to know what was coming...and the scene where he comments, ""the lights seem to going out all over Europe..."" was moving in the extreme.",1415318400,,435,4.684210526315789

6445092,5,B00KSEAMAG,"Excellent movie explaining the start of WWI.  I've read about it many times, but have always been confused.  The movie is quite unbiased, in my opinion, doesn't make the British to be always the champions of good, the Germans the Evil Empire.  It isn't complementary about the Kaiser or Moltke, but they still come across as real people, caught up in the events that would seem so easy to avoid in hindsight, yet were so confusing at the time.  I really liked the British Foreign Sec't. and his assistant, laboring to make the most of conflicting interpretations of what was really going on.  The spider's web of alliances was really quite hard to unravel.  I have watched this movie once, and anticipate watching it many times, in order to pick up all the historical nuances, but also to enjoy the actors' performances.  Very well done.",1415059200,4,837,4.731034482758621
6445093,5,B00KSEAMAG,"Words can hardly describe the DVD 37 Days.  BBC has done an excellent job in describing the diplomatic events after the assassination of the Archduke on June 28, 1914.  Teachers should use 37 Days in the classroom as a learning tool.  I highly recommend the DVD to everyone interesting in the diplomatic affairs that led the world into World War I.",1414886400,,348,4.672131147540983
6445094,5,B00KSEAMAG,"As many have reviewed here, this is an amazingly good ""docudrama"" very well done by BBC.  The storyline and script is gripping, and very well acted by many of England's best actors.  Really puts the viewer in the role of watching the events actually happen.  But so painful to watch too - like watching a train wreck in slow motion, as some have described that time period.

It is clear that the writing was carefully researched, and to my understanding of events from several recent books on this subject seems to be very accurate.  Yes, it is to some degree London-centric, but this is after all for a BBC audience - and the Brits did play the role of honest broker in trying to stop the relentless march towards war, so in that sense London was a center of the diplomatic drama taking place.  But it also spends a lot of time in Berlin and elsewhere.

And being oriented to the diplomatic jockeying going on, this DVD is different in slant from the other BBC documentary ""Royal Cousins"", which is yet another take on how this train wreck happened.  Also a very good DVD.

The depiction of Sir Edward Grey was quite interesting.  It has been said that if he had been more forthright in his expression of British intent, the Germans may have had second thoughts.  But then again maybe not - the German military machine and train schedules had their inexorable momentum that even the Kaiser may not have been able to stop.

The scene of the British cabinet debating whether to go to war over Belgium is riveting, and worth the price of the DVD alone.

At 2-1/2 hours (3 episodes) this may be long for some, but this is a complex subject and it takes that long to really do it justice.  Not boring in the least.  Highly recommended.",1414540800,,1731,4.485623003194888

6445097,1,B00KSEAMAG,"I actually would not recommend this mini-series to friends.  As dull and uninteresting as it was made, it could have been done in an hour.  It was so stretched out it brought out no emotions at all.  The way it was directed and put together it took an incident that brought the world to WWI and it left a feeling of - so what!  Too dull, too boring, extremely dry and with no sense of intensity it was poorly done.  No entertainment element to it at all.  It was so bland and the acting so mechanical that even for historical purposes it seemed more of a waste of time.  I hate to give negative reviews, but I could find little value in this historical piece.  A disappointment for a BBC production.  It takes a great deal of patience to get through it.",1414195200,7,753,4.246478873239437

From the killing of ArchDuke of Austria. I think this does seem historically correct and I even think I learned a few things that I never knew. It is 2 1/2 hours long but if you are a history buff, it never seems to be too long at all. Great performances by all involved, I can't single anyone out they are all terrific and this is done in Movie format not as a documentary. When you see it you will see how scary and easy it is for something like this to happen.",1412208000,,640,4.087301587301587

6445103,5,B00KSEAMAG,"This is a timely and very well-made docudrama about the lead-up to the outbreak of WWI. It must be pointed out that this depiction emphasizes the point of view from London, and to a lesser extent, Berlin, and is really not an attempt at a comprehensive portrayal of the entire crisis, but rather how Great Britain was gradually sucked into it. A reasonable attempt is made to describe, in dialog and occasionally in brief scenes, major events and developments taking place in Vienna, Moscow and Paris, albeit in the latter case only as depicted by the French Ambassador in London. Considering the short time available to treat such a complex issue, this production did an excellent job of presenting the crisis through the eyes of a few key decision-makers. Although the British Foreign Office and Cabinet receive the most attention, the treatment of the tension between the German Chancellor, the Kaiser, Chief the General Staff, and the German Ambassador in London is particularly well done.",1411344000,6,993,5.024242424242424
