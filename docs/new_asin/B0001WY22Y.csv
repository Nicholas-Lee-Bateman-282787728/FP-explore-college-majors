8200385,5,B0001WY22Y,"This DVD is awesome...The live footage was taken from the '93 ""Insanity & Genius"" tour...Line up: Sheepers (vocals), Rubach (bass), Nack (drums) and Hansen and Schlatter (guitars)...

The show has an excellent audio and a quality image, considering that it was recorded more than 10 years ago...And the menu is quite sympathetic, with a nice fire and ice animation...

It also features some interviews, band footage, behind the cameras, etc...And the Photo sessions for the ""I & G"" album as well...

Most of the songs are from ""Insanity & Ganius"", but you shouldn't miss the Helloween medley including ""I Want Out"" / ""Future World"" / ""Ride The Sky""...

Nothing really much to say about it; If you're a Gamma Ray fan you should own this DVD...",1131494400,2,742,4.865079365079365
