8710756,5,B00VNQWTJK,"Consist of three segments; 1) The Nest 2) Location, Location, Location 3) Animal Cities. What you will witness on the third segment is unlike any documentary that you have witnessed before. Home where our heart is, becomes such a reality that you will see same sex parents abandon one chick out of their two chicks just in name of reproduction and survival, a footage that I had never witnessed before.

I have been involved in few architectural masterpieces that required many consultants with resumes and qualifications that were envy of others. In animal world the only consultant, the only architect, the only builder is the male with the help of female some of the time but the final sign off is with the female just like in human world. The planing process, the engineering, the material used serve only one purpose, protection from all elements not limited only to heat, cold, rain, snow, predators but more importantly, the shortest distance to the closest grocery store with a full menu of all necessary food ingredients for survival of all the family members in the worst possible conditions at a time.

This item for sale is in a DVD format but the streaming is in HD version. Ecologist Chris Morgan (Siberian Tiger Quest, Bears of the Last Frontier) serves as a very qualified reporter for this documentary which you will enjoy and learn so much about the simple approach of building a home, sweet home without all the drama that humans go through. The documentary offers a vast amount of knowledge about many elements that each specie goes through in order to choose a location and construct a new home or to renovate an existing home, engineered unlike any other home in the neighborhood or infact anywhere in the world. Amazing cinematography, fun and informative documentary to watch with your kids. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1430352000,5,1836,4.881410256410256
8710757,1,B00VNQWTJK,"The third of three weekly segments of this program ended last evening on our state-wide network broadcast PBS station.
5 stars for the ""Animal Homes"" idea and recording.
But why would consumers continue to purchase these high def recorded and broadcasted programs, released on the sub-standard DVD, not a Blu-ray edition?
Is the general consumer that dense to understand - the DVD is old technology?
It's time to demand all releases on the Blu-ray format.
