493707,5,6302682525,"I enjoyed this very much.  It is interesting what went on in these pre-production code films.  This is a powerful woman who knows how to get what she wants, and even has amazing gadgetry to help her!  Life in the thirties was very different, but we humans may be very much the same in how our minds work. Enjoy.",1080518400,5,311,4.237288135593221
493708,4,6302682525,"A funny, fascinating role-reversal yarn. Ruth Chatterton, once known as one of the finest actresses of the early talkie era, plays Alison Drake, who runs a major automobile company with an iron hand - and tries to conduct her love life the same way....Then independent-minded George Brent (her real-life spouse at the time) comes along. Ruth falls for the guy so hard, that she promotes him to being the boss of the company, admitting that it's a man's job, after all. The set design is incredibly lavish: watch for the organist perched in Chatterton's entrance foyer! According to modern sources, the shots of the heroine's house were filmed at the Ennis House in the Hollywood Hills - which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Included in the cast are some familiar faces: Sterling Holloway, Laura Hope Crews, Rafaela Ottiano, Jean Muir & Irving Bacon. A fine early example of chauvinistic filmmaking.",1030665600,9,903,4.986754966887418
7829088,5,6302682525,"Wonderful pre-Code film with a woman boss of a car company who uses her male employees like Kleenex! Ok, sounds sexist, but it's a great role reversal and very ahead of its time. She lives in the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Ennis Brown house, which was new at the time. Probably its first appearance on film. Sadly it doesn't get featured, and the pool scenes use a fake square concrete bricked replica backdrop. Clean-shaven George Brent is the first man to stand up to the lady boss, and he delivers some real whammy lines. Visually it is almost like an ad for Art Deco style. Of course it's rather corny, especially the ending, but if you enjoy pre-Code, role reversal, and/or just Art Deco design, you'll want to see this.",1420675200,,726,4.592307692307692
7829089,3,6302682525,"loved this film primarily b/c I remember what is was like not too long ago how a woman at the top was viewed and this is 80yrs later... some progress! It is hard to imagine a woman sport f-ing on a regular basis like a man but the vodka bell to insure courage in a potential partner was most amusing...  she had the entire routine down and seemed satisfied, one of the biggest horrors seen in the background was the incredible POLLUTION from that plant, was it a rubber factory?? could not imagine why she would even have those large portrait windows to illuminate the filth coming from her precious firm...  I wanted to hear more about the dang schematic drawings myself given they were discussing how to re-purpose the manufacturing assembly line for automatic shifting, but George didn't have a chance...  would be better to see a prototype, oh really, she's a darn genius!!! lol  of course the main concern with the plot is the final scene as she was not allowed to maintain the break neck speed of stimulating work which she claimed to love and had to fall apart complete with one tear n hankie to comprehend she needs marriage!  sharp witty dialogue, with a very kewl pool party with perfect pairing diving partners...  I guess when she hears that same ol tune n thinks of the shooting gallery she has truly found true love, hmmmm, guess it didn't take much bak then? need to do some research on the scriptwriting to see who they modeled these fantasy characters or were they???  high recommend for the superwoman role but close your eyes at the end!",1370995200,,1556,4.575539568345324
7829090,5,6302682525,"Ruth Chatterton is a find, and I had never heard of her before or seen any of her movies.  She is the star of this film and carries it marvelously.  Ruth is the president of a car manufacturing company similar to GM.  She takes on the role of leader and acts like a man and is a decisive leader for the company.  She even has an entourage of male subordinates and secretaries who answer to her every whim.  She eventually falls in love with George Brent (her husband in real life) who is a working man and she learns to allow him to be in charge and becomes a lowly woman so she can have the joy of marriage and babies.  Before the disappointing end, Ruth's character is a strong, competent, wise-cracking woman.  One who would be deemed a feminist role in the future.  A hidden gem.",1329523200,,783,4.27891156462585
7829091,4,6302682525,"Alison Drake is the powerful and wealthy owner of a car manufacturing company, and her years of working in a man's industry have hardened her. She indulges in many casual affairs, several of them with her own employees. She meets Jim Thorne, a brilliant engineer recently hired by her company, and attempts to seduce him. Shocked when he scorns her, she modifies her method and eventually he succumbs to her charms, but they have vastly differing ideas of where to take their relationship. The problem with this film is preventing modern sensibilities from coloring how you react to the story; these days, any executive (male or female) who behaved in this manner would be slapped PDQ with a sexual harassment suit, and rightly so. However, this film was made Pre-feminism, when the world was a vastly different place for working women, especially female executives. As this film was also made Pre-code, it is quite frank in its depiction of casual sexual encounters. The shocking aspect at the time was surely the fact that it was a woman behaving in such a casually sexual fashion. An interesting detail is that Ruth Chatterton was herself a bit of a feminist, being an author and an aviator (she was friends with Amelia Earhart), as well as an actress, and she was married to a younger man - George Brent, her costar in this film (considered shocking at the time). Although largely unknown today, she was a wonderful actress and this movie showcases her talents beautifully. Her costar, George Brent - not so much! (I simply cannot understand the appeal of this guy!) For me, the film ending was somewhat unsatisfactory, but  that's those modern sensibilities getting in the way again!",1329350400,,1688,4.881533101045296
7829092,4,6302682525,"Ruth Chatterton stirred the censors in the 1933 pre-code favourite FEMALE, the story of a woman who conducts her lovelife as matter-of-factly as she does her large industrial empire.

Alison Drake (Ruth Chatterton) is quite literally a woman in a man's world.  She inherited her father's booming automobile business after his death, and has run the firm with an iron fist.  Male employees who catch her eye are often invited back to her mansion after-hours, and seduced to the ominous strains of ""Shanghai Lil"", played either on the grammophone or, most bizarrely, by an in-house organist.  When any of her lovers tries to get possessive, they are promptly packed off to the Montreal factory.

Beginning to tire of her usual sex games, Alison ventures off one night to see if she can attract a man without her name or money clouding the situation.  At a sideshow fair she meets Jim Thorne (George Brent), and the sparks fly naturally for a change.  But Alison gets the shock of her life when, the following morning, Jim turns out to be a new employee at the car factory!  Desperately in love, Alison reverts back to her old tricks in a bid to hold her man, but she's going to have to swallow her pride - and become the woman she's always kept hidden away...

Coming right at the tail-end of the pre-code era, FEMALE suffered under the wrath of the SRC (a precursor to what became the Production Code in 1934); and the film itself was banned from any possible re-release until the Production Code was dissolved in the 1950's.  Married in real life at the time, Ruth Chatterton and George Brent both deliver fabulous performances.  In what's arguably her best screen role, Ruth Chatterton revels in some snappy dialogue (in one scene, where Alison is quizzed on why she doesn't want a husband, Alison snaps back in rapid-fire fashion, ""I'd rather have a canary!"").

7829094,5,6302682525,"A great movie about a female running a large company back when that was more fantasy than it is today, I am a Ruth Chatterton fan and i have about 4 of her movies. To see herWith her real life husband George Brent made it even better for me, I find it strange that people are calling it old fashion and it was made in 1933",1274659200,,322,3.893939393939394
7829095,3,6302682525,"Female is the story about a woman who acts like a man. Alison Drake (Ruth Chatterton) runs an automobile company and she uses her influence to bring men home with her. She is a machine at the office, but she softens up just enough to seduce her employees at home to the tune of ""Shanghai Lil."" The next day it is business as usual; she doesn't even call them again. It is a unique situation, but one day Alison wanders to a carnival and meets a man there (George Brent). They flirt and spend some time together, but he doesn't try to pick her up. Offended but intruiged, she is shocked to find her company has just hired him on. She tries to utilize her feminine wiles to seduce him but he will have none of it.

This movie is interesting as a pre-code, but it raises some women's issues as well. Is it okay for a woman to behave like a man, and if she does, must she give up being Female? Alison referrs to herself as a ""superwoman"" on several occasions; Molly Haskell goes into the meaning of the word in depth in her book From Reverence to Rape. According to Haskell, a superwoman is a woman who lives as a man, even to the point of abandoning her seductive qualities. What is interesting is seeing the transition Chatterton makes from a superwoman to a superfemale and why she chooses to change. Maybe the story is a bit old fashioned, and it certainly isn't all that exciting, but it is a nice time capsule.",1231372800,,1412,4.30827067669173
7829096,4,6302682525,"Until he took them away. No reviews on this one for several years. Maybe everyone is waiting for the dvd version in March. The often told tale of a strong women using & disposing of men. However. in this early version, Alison (Ruth Chatterton), starts out on top. She is the ultimate practitioner of compartmentalism. Daytime, she is the boss, all business, as the president of her auto company. At night she is also the boss. She's like a cat in heat & goes through a string of boy-toys that work for her, leaving broken hearts in her wake. Then she hires George Brett. He doesn't play her game. He is all business, day & night. It drives her nuts because for once she has fallen in love with an employee. She has met a man stronger than she is. This movie is included in Forbidden Hollywood vol. 2, next year with documentaries, commentaries, etc. I've only seen this once, some time ago so am looking forward to the collection on dvd.",1196208000,,937,4.453488372093023
7829097,5,6302682525,"Ruth Chatterton, an actress which I had only seen in one of my very, very favorite films of all time, William Wyler's masterpiece, ""Dosworth"" (her best-known movie), carries this picture, which stands remarkably well the ""test of time"", in a different kind of role and not only that: in ""Dodsworth"" she was the wife of a small-town automobile tycoon, here she is the ruthless, sexually liberated, Automobile Company Tycoon, herself.

In this flick, she manages her company, with no holds-barred, with a hand of steel, surrounded by handsome young men, who are discarded, one after the other, when they have served ""her leisure purposes"". A refreshing role-reversal (an very daring then), with a woman ""on top"". She has all the POWER.

But then comes (then-husband in real life) George Brent, who impersonates an independent-minded executive, who changes Chatterton's life...as she were expecting such dominant male?.

Nice support by Johnny Mack Brown, Gavin Gordon and Philip Reed (a ""very naive"" young man or something ""else""? (as stated in Vieira's book ""Sin in Soft Focus"", a must read for Pre-Code Fans), as some of the men, who are invited to ""have dinner with her"", at her lavish, very luxurious house. Ravishing clothes by Orry-Kelly.

In all, a compelling, entertaining film, with fast-talking entrepreneur Chatterton in top form.

You won't regret buying this great Pre-Code.

P.S. Look for Ferdinand Gottschalk as her (Chatterton's) elder assistant, who gives a very funny performance and delivers some highly-amusing lines.",1090108800,8,1535,5.296296296296297
