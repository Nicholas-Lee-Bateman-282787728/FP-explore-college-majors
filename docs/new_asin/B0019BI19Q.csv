8273250,5,B0019BI19Q,"This movie is great! Of course, you have to be either a child or a Craig Ferguson fan to get the most out of it, but if you enjoy the slightly campy ( okay, maybe  a little more than slightly), you should enjoy this....",1245801600,,219,3.977272727272727
8273251,1,B0019BI19Q,"Unless you are under the age of 6,this movie is a complete pile of Lenny the Wonderdog doo!  However, if you are a fan of Craig Ferguson, it is worth fast forwarding through to view him as the evil,obviously bi-polar Dr. Wagner. You will still be able to figure out all the non-existent plot twists while skipping to Mr. Ferguson's scenes. Otherwise, it is not worth the cost of the dynamite it would take to blow it up.",1163116800,5,420,4.384615384615385
