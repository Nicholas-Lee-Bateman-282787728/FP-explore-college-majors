I was looking for something more challenging than a lot of the prenatal DVDs out there and this is it.  Exercises can be modified in a number of different ways to make it more challenging or easier throughout pregnancy, and it's super easy to follow.  The mat buns/hip circuit STILL kicks my butt.",1509408000,,401,4.7
8694284,4,B00R6JLP4S,"This workout is hard. If you weren't working out before pregnancy, I wouldn't recommend particularly given it has pretty much the most aggressive cardio of any of my 12 prenatal exercise dvd. I like that it feels like a real workout. Two of the 6 segments use the exercise band and getting the band on and it not a crunching up is annoying. The first time I used it, it took me about 10 minutes to get it unstuck and on. I think you probably could do the workout without it though. I didn't exercise my first pregnancy and have some weak hips as a result so the floor buns section is excruciating for me but I can get through it without the band. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Over all I would recommend this. I think it's well balanced and challenging.",1501286400,,762,4.298611111111111
8694285,5,B00R6JLP4S,"Jillian Michaels highly recommends Andrea and I haven't been disappointed! I really like her attitude and encouragement and she works those buns! I'm even considering adding her regular workouts after pregnancy with my Jillian workouts. Very, very pleased with this DVD and the hipster.",1488499200,,286,5.5227272727272725
8694286,1,B00R6JLP4S,"I don't have huge thighs (I'm a size 28) but after using the exercise band daily for a week (which by the way is required for a majority of the video) it snapped in half, leaving me with the expensive video that I can't do without the band.  For the price of this video it should come with a better quality band!",1488326400,,312,4.032258064516129

8694289,5,B00R6JLP4S,"Love this workout, but is not for beginners. The whole workout lasts aprox 50 min , but you can do sections of it. It has two cardio sections-squats, lunges, etc plus weights for arms and legs and leg exercises with the elastic band stand up and on the floor which are tough, you can tell you are working out , it is not boring at all, the instructions are clear and even though Andrea is not pregnant , it is ok because the other two girls are and you can always do the modifications. For many exercises you need a chair for balance . I'm in my third trimester and getting more tired so now I'm just doing 25 min. This DVD along Leah Sarago-Prenatal Physique are my favorites.",1427760000,5,677,4.255813953488372
