3936681,4,B002IKLVIU,"This is a very interesting movie being marketed in a non-traditional way.  Amazon has the exclusive rights to it as I understand, and the DVDs are kind of made to order.  Whatever the marketing and how well it works for them, this horror movie with a wink of the eye, needs to be seen, especially by fans of Dario Argento and the old school slasher films.  Filmed in 35MM 1.85 A/R, the movie looks amazing.  The colors are brilliant and definitely an homage to Argento, as are other aspects of the movie.  The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure what to think, because I had read too much hype, and was expecting a dumbed down horror comedy making fan of slasher movies.  In otherwords, I had low expectations, and after the first viewing, it left me a little confused.  That's why I wanted to listen to the commentary on the second viewing, and this time, I found it to be a very good horror film even if it doesn't take itself too serious.  The story is about Aaron (Henry Thomas) who has a problem with his noisy upstairs neighbor Linda (Kelli Garner).  He manages to watch through his keyhole and meet her at a laundromat, where he comes off as a big jerk of a neighbor.  But he does manage to get her to have lunch with him, where she tells him she is mad because she was invited to a birthday party in a cabin by a lake, and her boyfriend won't take her.  So Aaron decides to tell her a story about taking revenge on those friends with a goofy looking stalking killer, that has a polaroid type camera on his head, and takes a picture of his victim before the slice and dice routine.  Yea, the killer is pretty silly, but his killings in this story Aaron is telling, is not silly at all, and pretty gruesome.  Linda gets a little fed up with creepy Aaron and leaves, but they both live in the same building, so they meet again, and then Aaron agrees to drive her to the cabin and the birthday party.  That's probably as much of the story and plot I should tell, because this movie is basically a story within a story.

The technical aspects of the movie are brilliant with very vibrant colors and excellent camera work, and very good acting and direction.  Listening to the commentary is important, because it is easy to miss all the homages on first viewing, and Joe Moe's producer commentary fills in all the blanks.  On the gorehound level, there are two or maybe three good kills, and one excellent gore scene with a guy getting sawed in two head to belly.  I definitely liked that one, and that along with at least one more would definitely eliminate an R rating, so it's good they didn't care about the rating.  But outside of some pretty decent kills, I liked the whole idea of the setup and payoff, even though I pretty much had the whole thing figured out pretty early.  It doesn't matter, because watching it all unfold is a lot of fun, especially with the excellent creepy performance by Henry Thomas.  I would definitely recommend this movie, it delivers the goods, and is absolutely a delight to watch visually.  You could say, it's a very pretty horror film, and even though it does make a little bit of fun of the slasher genre, it doesn't go too far and comes out being just plain silly.  On second viewing, it came out much more to me as a good horror film, than a homage to the slasher genre.  Give this one a try, it comes with some very good extras, and as I said, a very very good commentary.  It's also the last time you'll see of the late Forrest J Ackerman in a brief cameo.  Congrats to producer Joe Moe, and director Bruce Dickson for producing a rather unique horror film that is also a lot of fun.",1253318400,4,3633,4.345185185185185
3936682,5,B002IKLVIU,"Even the stylish opening credits made me smile!  With gorgeous intense color from the beginning, the credits' partially ""animated"" characters fascinated me.  Some letters are not so much letters as they are exotic figures, changing before your eyes.  Perhaps a hint of what's to come, and what is to come is more than a little magical plot shifting, stories unfolding and changing before your eyes!

And that's the joy of this dark red gem of a movie!  I laughed, I puzzled, I doubted, I marveled.  I even said ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" at some of it.  Oh, those gorgeous color-washed walls and halls! Gorgeous Bava-esque color-drenched scenes!  And the titular blood red color here and there, from tomato sauce to car to settee to cake (red velvet cake is not normally my first choice of flavor, but I was craving it by the end of this movie).

I made some notes as I watched--and then afterwards I watched the EXTRAS.  I wanted to see what caught my eye without having anything called to my attention beforehand. It pleased me that I singled out a number of the very things the filmmakers chose to comment on in their EXTRAS section.

These are a few of my favorite things:
As I said before--the color, which often made me think of Bava.  But I thought of David Hockney's L.A. paintings, too, and Argento's stylish dark scenes.  RED VELVET is its own work of art, though, and I promise you, the sets and lighting won't fail to impress and delight!

Laundromat.  Oh, now the fun begins, the wonderful dialogue that snips and snaps and twines in and out.  Henry Thomas and Kelli Garner are wonderful, sounding each other out, poking and prodding and playing. And the look of the place! The folded laundry skull made me laugh.  I love the place's cheesy painted window--WASH & FLUFF, BIG LOADS.  And from the laundromat they move to the Thai restaurant (look for a sweet, small cameo shot of the late Forry Ackerman chatting up a pretty girl! Forry's last film appearance, I think?)--and Henry and Kelli--with surreal roach and wok images interspersed--caught up in the story-telling that becomes the film's plot.

There is a marvelous ""family"" story-within-story, a family group David Lynch would love--Oh, no, NOT the spilled sauce!  NOT the marinara!  My god, I have known families not too dissimilar from this one, families that shouldn't exist, but--do!  The mom (with the eye! marvelous eye efx!) was a treat.  And the little boy was excellent, looking more than a little like a young Henry Thomas.

Sex--a little here and there, and attractive bodies (something for everybody!), as required in every self-respecting slasher flick.  Not too much--just enough!

The maniacal killer--his wonderful ""body language"", and the disguise--what a great bit of business, the polaroid camera recording last moments, and the other techno additions!  The bunny ear look made me laugh--and creeped me out, too.  I don't want to make any spoilers here--you KNOW this is a slasher movie, so you know there will be killing going on!  Excellent killings...a double hammer bash, a wonderful lumberjack saw (and a musical saw solo!!)--and an alligator.  I laughed out loud there, too!  Funny, inventive takes on the slasher flicks of a couple decades back.

The movie never let me down--never dragged or bored.  It was a treat to be jerked around a bit--to figure out what is going on, have the rug pulled out from under me, re-figure what's happening..a wonderful combo of suspense and comedy.  A gleeful take on the old slasher flicks--this one, though, is a slasher flick for the intelligent!  And again, the look of it--the camera work. Lovely, seamless cinematography!

And Henry Thomas, period--he was wonderful, and Kelli Garner was equally fine.  Everyone's acting was excellent, as was direction, as were the mind-bending effects.  Effects!  Some brilliant things done by way of carnage efx in this movie!  Nothing about the film said ""first effort"", nothing shoestring about it.  It was witty, it was wonderfully off-kilter, it was fun.  And it was GOOD!

Kudos to everyone involved.  I highly recommend RED VELVET both to the casual thrill-flick fan and to the discriminating cinephile!",1253059200,14,4172,4.932471264367816
3936683,5,B002IKLVIU,"I have to admit I am not a huge fan of horror movies but this wasn't just that. This took it to a whole new level and took away the torture porn that's common these days in this genre. The film has a great story, great dialogue, great actors, and is beautifully shot! My favorite parts are in the story inside the story ( have to see it to understand). There is a girl I have never seen before, Cristen Coppen, who plays Pat. She has to be my favorite she is super funny, natural, and just gorgeous. Henry Thomas as always knocks it out of the park as usual. SO to all horror fans and people looking for a fun entertaining movie I suggest you get this its like nothing you have ever seen.",1252108800,6,688,4.103703703703704
3936684,5,B002IKLVIU,"I had the pleasure of seeing ""Red Velvet"" about 2 years ago at a special screening and it impressed the butt off of me. It takes the typical slasher film and dissects it in a way that makes it fresh and new. This films is for those who say ""there are no original horror films anymore"". This one is very original, very unique, very well acted, written and directed. Most of all, it's fun. Highly recommended.",1251417600,7,407,4.368421052631579
3936685,5,B002IKLVIU,"The people behind ""Red Velvet"" have claimed the movie as being a ""sexy stylish horror film."" The first time watching the trailer and going through the image gallery on the movie's official web site, you could definitely tell that this really was going to be a movie with style. What else are you suppose to think when one of the images that you see for a movie has a guy in a ski mask with a lit candle on his head and melted wax running down it? Given that, I knew this was a movie I had to see since what it looked like was a horror movie taking place inside the head of an eclectic artist.

As odd as it may seem, that's actually what ""Red Velvet"" is, or at least part of the story is anyway. You are essentially given two movies: one is about two people who live in the same apartment building, running into each other at a laundromat, while the other is about a killer crashing a birthday party out in the woods. Our main characters, Aaron (Henry Thomas) and Linda (Kelli Garner), end up having to spend the day together because of dirty laundry, and instead of continuing to annoy one-another, Aaron tells Linda a story. A horror story about a group of young-adults getting together at an isolated cabin in the woods to celebrate the birthday of one of their friends, based around a real party and real friends that Linda was suppose to meet but couldn't.

So, while there are two different movies going on, each movie is in its own genre. The story that Aaron is telling, of a typical 80's slasher of a masked killer picking off party goers while they delve deeper into their acts of debauchery. Naturally, that covers the horror part of ""Red Velvet"". The other part, of Aaron and Linda interacting with each other, cover's the comedy aspect. Of course there is comedy included in the horror portion, but really a lot of the humor comes from Aaron (an obvious recluse who doesn't like people) and the general interaction he and Linda have. Thankfully there is a great chemistry between the actors really helps to sell this situation and allows for their beginning relationship of petulant sarcasm to be highly amusing and entertaining.

The other side of ""Red Velvet"", the horror part, is what really won me over and is what will definitely win over most of the audience. Not simply because it's the horror part of the movie and it's being watched by horror fans, it's because of how stylized they were able to make it and pull it off. The setup is very much in the style of any 80's slasher movie, which is understandable since it's only suppose to be a story within a story. So it actually gives ""Red Velvet"" free reign to do what it wants to and get away with what wouldn't normally sit well in a standard horror movie. It also allows the characters telling the story to rib the horror genre in general. Which may or may not break it for some people, as it's not a direct spoof of horror movies, but it does parody them a bit that not only helps the story but the humor as well. As for the actual style itself; god was this movie refreshing. Instead of just going with typical color filter slapped on the lens of a steady-cam. The people behind the camera actually take things back a bit and draw inspiration from Italian movies, not just with something like ""Suspiria"", but the older Italian gothic movies from the 70's. It uses colors like red, blue, and green to light the scenes, or in some cases uses all three at the same time. Match that with some really dynamic camera work and what you get is a movie that becomes a real treat for the eyes, and not only that but a visually unique piece of work as well. While some of the inspirations are obvious, the fact remains that nobody makes movies like this anymore and that's what really helps to give ""Red Velvet"" its presence and really stand out in the crowd of a genre that is filled with bland filmmaking.

While ""Red Velvet"" is a horror movie, it isn't looking to scare the audience, it accepts the fact that because of how desensitized the audience is it is harder to scare them. So it approaches at being more of an entertaining horror movie rather than going for cheap jump scares, and it works. Which is good, because it makes it easier to go back in for repeated viewings, which is what you need to do too fully appreciate the movie. Because of how clever the overall story is and how well it's pulled off, your first viewing will be a completely different experience from your second. Since the movie is about a character telling a story, you'll begin to notice and catch things going on within the movie that give subtle hints to the characters and both stories, that will go unnoticed from the first time you watch it.

Overall, ""Red Velvet"" was a great viewing experience because of everything it brought to the table, and manages to make it all work. With it's story that doesn't try to outsmart the audience with ridiculous plot twists, but doesn't think they're so dumb that everything needs to be explained, rather it allows the audience to put the pieces together as the movie progresses. It's a movie that doesn't take it's self too seriously, but doesn't get to silly with it's parody elements, but does have it's tongue planted firmly in it's cheek. It isn't even afraid to go over-the-top with it's gory death scenes of severed heads flying, high blood spray, and even having a person getting sawn in half (vertically) with one of those old fashion tree logging saws. Even though it's over-the-top, it still works quite well with the rest of the movie, and if anything, it helps make it that much more entertaining. Essentially, the best way I can describe ""Red Velvet"" is artistic madness; combining an entertaining blood filled horror tale with a visually stunning presence. While ""Red Velvet"" is definitely not for everyone and their will undoubtedly be those who don't like it, I say take the chance and give it a shot. Just in case.",1249948800,19,5923,4.516309412861137
8371041,4,B002IKLVIU,"Even though this film was made in 2009 (under the shooting title ""The Birthday Party""), it got very spotty distribution besides a few film festivals, even though those who have seen it have given it great reviews. Hell, you still can only buy it on a Made-on-Demand DVD-R (No big deal for me, but I know it's a turn-off by ""purists"", even though the anamorphic widescreen print looks amazing. Try Amazon to get a MOD copy. They are the exclusive distributors.). I think it's a wonderful film to add to your library, no matter which format it is released on. The film begins with Aaron (Henry Thomas; E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL - 1982; DEAD BIRDS - 2004) trying to do some work in his apartment, but every night he has to put up with the screaming arguments and throwing objects tantrums of his next-door neighbors, Linda (Kelli Garner; HORNS - 2013) and Kyle (Jordan Hagan). The walls are thin, so Aaron can hear everything and it's impossible for him to get things done. Aaron meets Linda at the local laundromat, where their conversation about what he hears through his walls gets contentious at times (Aaron tells her, ""PlayStations don't cry, Linda!""). They both seem to get a thrill putting each other down (Aaron is sporting a black eye, but he refuses to tell Linda how he got it.).
They decide to have lunch together at the local Thai restaurant, where they continue their adversarial conversation, until Aaron tells her that he is a storyteller. As we watch the Thai cook squish a cockroach on the cooking grill as she flicks it away with her cooking utensils (which is why I don't eat Thai food!), Aaron tells Linda a story. It is about a family of four, the father (S.A. Griffin; NEAR DARK - 1987), daughter (Carli Westerman; KING OF THE ANTS - 2003) and son (Austin Whitlock) sitting around a dinner table, while they hear their crazy wife/mother (Carol Ann Susi; best known for her portrayal of the voice of recurring unseen character Mrs. Wolowitz on the television series THE BIG BANG THEORY; she passed away on November 11, 2014), who Dad say is off her meds, complaining about how her family doesn't appreciate her. She comes out of the kitchen with a spaghetti dinner and serves it to them with her hands, still complaining that her family takes advantage of her (she's quite scary, actually). She threatens her son with bodily harm, but Dad warns her not to touch him. She stares at her son and says, ""They won't be around forever. Just you wait. Just you wait!"" That night, Dad, aided by his son and daughter, suffocate her with a pillow while she is sleeping in bed and then just stand there, looking at the twisted face on her corpse. Linda is not impressed with Aaron's story because it is not ""horrific"" enough, so he tells her another story about a ninja that cuts off the female Thai's cook's head and cooks it, the severed head saying while it is cooking in the wok, ""It needs a little more fish salt!"" (There's an ingenious little moment where, when the cook's head is cut off, the blood splatters on a photo of a Thai pop star. We see the photo come to life as he looks at all the blood on his clothes! This film is full of those little moments.). When the ninja takes off the face covering, it turns out to be Linda, but even that story doesn't cheer her up because she wants to go to a party in a secluded cabin in the woods with her friends to celebrate a birthday, but Kyle won't let her borrow the car to drive there.
Aaron says he will make a ""custom"" story for Linda about the party she is going to miss, but he needs some background information first, including where the secluded cabin is located, the names of her friends who will be there (including birthday boy Frank [Bret Roberts; THE VIOLENT KIND - 2010] and Linda's sister Pat [Cristen Coppen; STAUNTON HILL - 2009]). With that information, Aaron begins to tell her his story, but the story keeps on changing due to Linda's constant interruptions of descriptions of her friends' looks and what type of cars they drive. Aaron continues telling his story, where Frank enters the cabin with Pat and everyone begins to party, but he is interrupted again, this time by the female Thai waitress, who says that she has seen Linda before. Aaron gets back to his story, but now Frank and the gang are heading to the local lake to do some swimming and rafting. Frank stops the story and says a story like this needs a maniac to crash the party, so he asks Linda to help him create the perfect maniac for the story. They come up with some weird ideas, like a maniac totally in blackface and another maniac with a toaster on his head (we see these maniacs on-screen and they are quite funny). They almost come up with a perfect maniac with a guy with a stocking over his head wrapped with barb wire, but they finally settle on a maniac wearing a black a ski mask with bunny ears, a Polaroid camera attached to the top of his head (so he can take photos of his dead victims), dressed in a one-piece white uniform (the kind that has a long zipper in the front) with a pink tool belt (that last one was Linda's idea).
While Frank and his friends are having fun at the lake, Jon (Kevin Wheatley; RISE: BLOOD HUNTER - 2006) returns to the cabin to pick up a CD player so they can listen to some tunes. The maniac wraps a thick wire around Jon's neck and strangles him until the CD player is pressed up against his ear. Linda is not too pleased that her friends are getting killed in the story, but Aaron convinces her that it will improve his story and Linda says, ""Death is too good for them!"", so Aaron continues his story. But before he can tell any more, the waitress brings the check and Linda heads back to the laundromat to fold her laundry (Aaron yells out, ""Kyle's a hobby. I'm for real!""). Aaron meets Linda back at the laundromat (where she teaches him how to properly fold clothes) and he tells Linda that if she really wants to be at the party, she would find a way to get there. Aaron tells Linda that he has a vision of Kyle, where he almost chokes to death on popcorn while watching sports on TV, almost gets stabbed by a butcher knife when he falls to the floor and the knife drops off the counter and then electrocutes himself by sticking a fork in a toaster. Linda laughs at Kyle's death in the story, but says he hasn't suffered enough, so Aaron embellishes on the story where Kyle falls down and a 5 gallon water bottle full of loose change gets lodged in his mouth, him swallowing all the coins (Believe me when I say that everything I have so far described will make sense. Just be patient.).
Linda makes Aaron finish the story about the maniac loose at the party, where we see nerd Roy (Eric Jungmann; Director Robert Englund's KILLER PAD - 2008) spying on a totally nude Frank and equally nude Jenny (Michele Nordin; ANCIENT EVIL: SCREAM OF THE MUMMY - 1999) having sex in the woods. The maniac stabs Roy over and over on his back, while Frank heads back to the lake. Jenny, who knew Roy was watching them, stays behind to give Roy a treat, but when she discovers his bloody body wedged between a fork in a tree, the maniac beheads her with an axe and her head goes flying through the air.
Linda thinks it's a clich that people in horror films and stories always get killed for having sex (it is) and she tells Aaron that Frank is actually gay, so he has to make a change to his story. This time, Roy and Jenny are stuck in a hole in the ground when someone throws them a rope. The only problem is that the other end the rope is tied around the neck of an alligator and, as they try to climb the rope, the alligator inches closer and closer to the hole, finally falling in and killing Roy and Jenny. The rest of the friends are back at the cabin when Franks decides to go looking for Jon (not knowing that he is already dead) and runs into Ken (Ryan Doom; CIRCLE - 2010), who is also gay. Frank ties himself up to a hook in the shed so he and Ken can participate in some S&M action. They engage in some kissing and foreplay when the maniac shows up and plays ""Happy Birthday"" on a huge tree saw (the kind it takes two people to use). The maniac then plants the saw in the top of Ken's head and cuts him vertically in half (the film's most graphic death). The blood sprays all over a tied-up Frank's body, but the maniac just takes a Polaroid of Ken's cleaved-in-two corpse and leaves Frank hanging. The last two people in the cabin, Pat and Amy (Natalia Baron) are dancing when Linda cuts off the story, carrying her folded laundry to to her apartment building, where she and Aaron share an elevator to their apartments.
Kyle has left their apartment a mess and is not there, so Linda goes to Aaron's apartment to complain that even though Kyle won't let her go to the party, he has bailed on her for the night. Aaron says the best revenge is that he drives her to the party to p**s-off Kyle. Linda races back to her apartment to get all dolled-up (something tells me it's more for Aaron than for her friends) and Aaron then begins to drive to the cabin, where the two discuss the real meaning of ""rub it in"" and that when a vegetarian takes a s**t, it's smellier than one who eats meat (that, too, is true). On the drive, Aaron finishes the party story, where Amy is freaking out about their missing friends (she says that maybe they all fell down a well and alligators ate them!). Pat and Amy leave the cabin to go look for their friends and end up on a fog-filled dock, where they hear someone whistling a catcall. Thinking it is their friends playing a prank on them, they soon realize their mistake, as they run into the maniac and their friends' dead bodies. They try to escape in a tinkered-with car, while the maniac takes a Polaroid of them (every time the maniac takes a photo, the background twirls around like a panel in a comic book). They leave the car, but the maniac bashes in Amy's head to a bloody pulp with two hammers, one in each hand (it's another really gory scene).
Linda once again interrupts and warns Aaron that he better not kill off his sister in the story, so we see Pat slug the maniac and tackle him into the lake and pulls off his ski mask. The maniac is Aaron and he drowns because of the weight of the pink toolbelt. When Aaron and Linda actually make it to the cabin, they notice that it is very quiet and then hear a woman scream in the cabin. Aaron goes to investigate, but when he doesn't come back, Linda goes into the cabin and discovers that the maniac holding a knife to Aaron's throat, so she kills the maniac with a claw hammer, only to find out it is her sister Pat. It seems Aaron was already at the cabin (remember, the walls that separates his and Linda's apartment are thin) and killed everyone there except Pat, who he left tied-up as a patsy (Remember Aaron's black eye? Pat gave it to him when she punched him into the lake.), but Kyle is now there as a surprise for Linda and beats up Aaron to a bloody pulp. But when Kyle and Linda go to leave the cabin, they open the door to find the ground covered in loose change and coins come pouring out of Kyle's mouth (think back), killing him. The film ends with Aaron burying all the bodies (including Linda alive) and returning to his apartment, where he thinks he will finally have peace and quiet at last. But one final surprise is in store as we discover that Aaron was the son that helped his family suffocate his mother and her ghost appears in his apartment to torment him forever.
This filmed-in-Los Angeles horror film has the same kind of structure as the cult hit TRICK 'R TREAT (2007), where we think every story is not related, but, in the end, we discover that they are all interconnected. This is the first fictional feature film by director Bruce Dickson, who also photographed and co-produced the horror film STITCH in 2014 and, for a first feature, it is damn good. The idea of making up stories on the fly is as old as storytelling itself, but this film infuses new blood into the concept, as they are not made-up stories at all, but actually the truth and Dickson fills the story with great dialogue between Aaron and Linda (supplied by screenwriters Anthony Burns and Joe Moe [who is also a producer]), some very graphic bloodshed and copious nudity. Henry Thomas is superb here, as we get the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with him, but we just can't put our finger on it. I generally don't like anthologies, but this really isn't one, as the stories change on a whim and end with quite a surprise (the only thing I'm not sure of is how the beheading of the Thai cook connects with anything, but I'm going to watch it again because there is a lot going on in this film that I may have missed). This is also final cameo appearance of Forrest J. Ackerman, but you'll have to be quick in spotting him early in the film (He gets a ""Thanks"" in the final credits, too). Recommended to people who like their films on the weird and slightly perverted side. Also starring Dina Lynne Morishita as the Thai waitress/cook and Steven Skyler as the Thai Pop Idol who gets blood spilled on his photograph. Also featuring Earl Roesel, Lateef Crowder and Lewis Tan as the various incarnations of the maniacs we are shown on screen. The DVD-R also contains a lot of extras and is well worth owning for $14.99. Most people think this is a 2008 production, but it has a 2009 copyright date at the end credits.

8371045,4,B002IKLVIU,"Red Velvet is a picture with visuals that get under your skin.  Henry Thomas (Elliot from the 80s family film E. T.) is surprisingly creepy as Aaron, a screenwriter who can't concentrate on his work because of all the arguing between a couple in the apartment down the hall.  He runs into the girl (Kelli Garner) in a laundromat down the block and they have an abrasive conversation about the hostile bickerings between her and her boyfriend which he cannot help but hear. Aaron is able to persuade her to go to lunch with him, and to try to get her interested in him, he attempts to entertain her by telling her terrifying stories about her friends meeting horrible deaths at the hands of a psychotic killer who dresses in a jumpsuit and takes Polaroid photos of his victims at the instant of their deaths.  We know from his stories that there is a very disturbed side to his personality and we wonder about hers too, actually!

They decide to take an unplanned trip to the cabin in the countryside where her real life friends are at this very instant, assembled for a birthday party.  Without giving away too much, I would like to just say that you will be guessing every minute as to what is lying in wait.

8371046,4,B002IKLVIU,"I am not typically a fan of the horror genre, although some of the spoofs have been amusing.  I tend to be turned off by the violence and predictability of the mainstream horror films.  That said, I enjoyed this film for its differences.

The cinematography is a departure from the norm on these films.  I enjoyed the use of light and color, and unusual perspective to make the less intense scenes more interesting.  There is a scene where the main characters are walking through their apartment complex that I particularly liked.

The story feels a little like the telling of a ghost story around a campfire, although this is done in a restaurant and laundermat, and made up as the two characters go along, punishing the protagonist's friends for enjoying themselves without her.  It doesn't follow the old tired progression of who gets killed when (such as teens having sex die first), so it's not as predictable, and I liked the switches in plot as additional details about the characters are revealed.

The special effects reminded me of the Kill Bill style, with the exagerated blood spray, albeit at a lower budget.  They weren't going for the realistic gore factor, and aren't taking themeselves too seriously in this film, which was refreshing.  I thought the dialog was good, with humor thrown in.  I could easily see this film becoming a cult classic.",1254960000,5,1361,4.823275862068965
8371047,3,B002IKLVIU,"For a low budget slasher flick, it was fairly well written.  The main actor and actress did a better job than you would expect making the characters believable and selling the storyline.  However, this movie was hampered by several factors.  The first was, at least it was obvious to me, that the ""twist"" in the end really wasn't much of a twist and you could tell it was coming about fifteen minutes into the movie.  The second is that the ""horror"" part of this movie, akin to a Firday the 13th kind of slasher vibe on LSD, suffered from very low budget special effects.  After watching it once, it made me wish I had rented it instead of bought it because I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",1254873600,5,691,4.3671875
8371048,1,B002IKLVIU,The words I wish to use would not be allowed here so let's just say... #@%&* ^%%$@ :^$#@@( +)!#%^<!!!!!!!!!!! Does that sum it up for everyone. Don't believe previous reviews as they are obviously involved with the film and are trying to promote it. And how dare one reviewer compare this film to that of anything by Dario Argento. While I do see the director attempted to COPY him in alot of scenes that's where any similarities end.,1254700800,6,434,4.576923076923077
8371049,4,B002IKLVIU,I had been waiting for this movie to come out since I met a couple of the actors at WonderCom in 2008.  I had almost forgotten about it when I received an email telling me that it was out.  The movie definitely met my expectations and then some.  Henry Thomas is briliant in his role as the lead and has a great chemistry with the Kelli Garner who is totally hot.  The plot moved around nicely and I was glued to the TV to see how it would play out.  The movie is not too short and not too long and has the right amount of gore.  The dialog and character development is what really makes the movie.  I definitly recommend the movi!,1254355200,4,631,4.08130081300813
8371050,5,B002IKLVIU,"Brilliance can not underestimate what Red Velvet has in store for you. I could write for days on how brilliant it was even when it came down to the dastardly disturbing Deaths, but doing that would bring UN-justice to this beautiful piece of horror art. Red Velvet brings you into a realm of Horror that co-insides with such great artist such as Sam Rami (Evil Dead). This is a movie that even the most fearful horror movie on goer can enjoy.  just don't forget your pink tool belt.",1253404800,4,482,4.4772727272727275
