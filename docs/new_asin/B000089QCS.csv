8305058,3,B000089QCS,"This edited American version of 'Cardcaptor Sakura: The movie' is aimed for kids who have enjoyed the dubbed version of the show on tv. In this movie, Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong and brings Tori, Julian, and Madison (Toya, Yukito, and Tomoyo in the Japanese original) with her. They meet up with Li Showron (Li Shaoran) and Meilin, and faces the evil sorceress Su Yung, who hates Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow cards. The show has been edited so that Sakura's crush on Julian is non-existant, and some battle scenes have been removed.
This dvd is a priced-down release of the same movie released in March 2002, and despite the changes made from the original Japanese version and the new cover design, it is worth the buy if you do not intend to purchase the unedited billingual dvd of this movie released by Pioneer. It's a bargain!",1044921600,,840,4.569536423841059
