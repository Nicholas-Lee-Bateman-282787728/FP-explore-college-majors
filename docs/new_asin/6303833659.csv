They are different in other respects too. The other one has more to the story and is presented in a different manner than this one.

 At least with this one, you have the opportunity to own it.",1526256000,,365,4.2
8031409,3,6303833659,"What saves this movie is that it was based on a true story. Joe Penny is a hot italian hunk in it. Much better looking than the real guy. Jenny Robertson is not the sexy siren they want her to be in this but she playes a nut really well. I think it could have been a bit more in depth into the real story, but touches on just enough facts to stay entertaining. For sure worth a few bucks and a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon.",1184198400,11,431,3.853932584269663
