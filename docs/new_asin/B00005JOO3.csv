1540998,4,B00005JOO3,I have had nightmares very similar to this films premise.  It gave me goose bumps.,1128384000,4,82,4.466666666666667
1540999,1,B00005JOO3,"The girl was too self-conscious, and the film too predictable. The tension was built up of clichd images often seen in films noir. It needed a more subtle treatment of the girl's paranoid fears. It would have been better had she imagined she was being spied on, as in Polankski's Repulsion, so that the  harsh ending would have come as a surprise, and not have been so obvious.",1128384000,,377,4.544117647058823

1541001,3,B00005JOO3,"If this is made to be seen on a computer screen, it was too dark much of the film, dark in the ""I cant see anything"" sense.  Well done, great sound.",1128384000,2,148,3.774193548387097
1541002,3,B00005JOO3,"The director did an excellent job of keeping things tight and suspenseful, and though the Internet was an interesting gimmick the movie, overall, is just too reminiscent of the opening scene from ""Scream"" for me to totally recommend it.  The line in which Richter tells the girl he likes her hair better down is practically identical to the one in ""Scream,"" when the killer tells Drew Barrymore he wants to see what she's wearing, or something like that.  Perhaps the talented director should get a better writer.  On the plus side, the lead actress was excellent, by far the best acting I've seen in the entire Amazon competition (1st and second round).  She should be a professional, if she's not already.",1128384000,3,707,4.818181818181818
1541003,5,B00005JOO3,"By its nature, Instant Messenger's interface offers dull visual images, namely a text box filled with characters and generic smiley faces. For this reason, ""Richter's"" creators took a major risk in choosing IM as the film's main plot device. Through their choice of shots, sound fx, and pacing, they succeeded in portraying the emotionlessness of an IM window in a perverse, almost humorous way. I love the closeup of the smiley-face list, and how the protagonist's emotions don't exactly match the implied tone of her type. The initial humor and disbelief suddenly disintegrates into something much more demented.  I never thought that I would find myself on the edge of my seat while watching somebody else's IM conversation.

  In addition, the film incorporates new technology in novel and creative ways. The climactic scene depicts the protagonist as ""boxed in"" to her own computer monitor, adding to the sense of claustrophobia in her apartment. She is helpless to stare at her own vacant image projected through her webcam. All-the-while, the pace of the infamous IM chimes quicken to match her racing heart.  Beep beep... beep beep... beepbeepbeepbeepbeep...

  Over all, excellent creative choices!  I imagine we will see more films like this in the coming years as the current generation of young tech-minded filmmakers descends upon Hollywood.",1128297600,4,1354,5.26046511627907
1541004,4,B00005JOO3,"At first, I thought well, it's in black and white well that adds to the suspense.  Then, I read the bottom and the comments and found out that this movie was made with only $100.00 and then what popped into my head was, ""another, Blair Witch Project.""  Actually, it's a really good film!  I'm surprised that's all it took.  It shows you that if you set your mind and wallet you can complete a film project in a day with a bare minimum.  I sat in suspense throughout the full 6:57 of film time.  Hey, I've been there too chatting away wondering or fearing that I'll bump into a crazy nut, who's marbles aren't all quite there.",1128297600,4,625,4.299145299145299

1541108,5,B00005JOO3,I enjoyed this entry. It kept my attention throughout. Seemed hard to see at times (may be monitor) but it felt like a scene from a real movie.,1130025600,,143,4.142857142857143
1541109,1,B00005JOO3,"The film maker cites Hitchcock as an influence. Yeah, we get that. I think the thing about Hitchcock that I liked so much is that he did not rely on ""Supernatural"" events such as unplugged computers powering up and connecting to the internet. I think that today's movie goer is a little too savvy for that. And that sort of thing moves this film from Suspense to Slasher flick. If you set out to make a Slasher flick, congrats! But don't be pretentious about it.",1130025600,2,462,4.447058823529412
1541110,1,B00005JOO3,"I'm sure this would have been much better if I could see anything.  The film was too dark to see anything at all, even in the few glimpses where it is obvious the director wanted you to see.

The thirty seconds of darkness about 4 minutes into the room as she waited for Alex to get there clearly had something to show, but I could not see it.

I am all for creative lighting but your audience should really be able to see more than a white spaghetti strap top.",1129939200,,461,4.1
1541111,3,B00005JOO3,"The film started out fine, and I especially liked the black and white lens. But the ending lacked because I didn't think the film was complete. It was sudden and obtuse. But still well made.",1129939200,,190,4.457142857142857
1541112,2,B00005JOO3,"I give this 2 stars instead of 1 simply because of the performance of the actess. The subject matter is too dark and so is the cinematography.

We have no idea who ""Richter"" is. Why does he have an agenda? How does ""Richter"" turn the computer back on after it's been unplugged? Why does the main character stay inside the house? Why no frantic searching over her shoulder and fear after the window breaks?

I really feel robbed here. Seems like an exercise that was assigned to the filmmakers, and not an original idea.",1129939200,,519,4.51063829787234
1541113,1,B00005JOO3,"Let me remind you that this has been done over and over and over again. Hollywood repeats these films time after time because they make money. As far as I'm concerned, you had absolutely no reason to make this film. I can't believe this is a finalist. Film festivals are supposed to exhibit work that is new and exciting.

I know (rather, I hope) you poured your heart and soul into making this film and it was worth it to you, regardless of my opinion.",1129939200,,453,4.329411764705882
1541114,3,B00005JOO3,"It was a solid suspense piece but no real surprises. It was ground covered a million times over by such substandard films as Scream and I know what you did last summer?? Perhaps done with a bit more style but still nothing fresh. The acting was as good as in the films mentioned above, which is not a compliment. For a piece to win the Tribeca one would hope for something that has more whether that be to shock, amuse or astonish. hard to do within the 7 minute limit but definitely possible.",1129593600,2,493,4.311827956989247
1541115,4,B00005JOO3,"Great concept. Suspence and tension are very good and the acting is good. Filming in such a dark atmosphere was an excellent choice, however, too much was lost in darkness. Filming the actor's reflection on her computer screen was very well done. I gave this film 4 stars because of too much black screen/no visuals. Excellent short.",1129593600,2,333,4.859649122807017
1541116,3,B00005JOO3,"Liked it, like a ""Scream"" type of a movie. A little too dark, hard to follow what the  character is doing when she is away from the computer.",1129593600,,141,4.035714285714286
1541117,3,B00005JOO3,"I liked this short film. I thougth it was very well done. The standout element of this film for me though was the main actress. She is incredibly beautiful in a ""girl next door"" sort of way and that part alone makes this short film worth watching. I liked the use of black and white instead of color to add effect. I liked the use of the IM tool in the film, that worked really well I thought.

The only thing I didn't like is that the story was just too predictable. It seemed too much like a knock off of the early 80's slasher film concept and lacked any story line originality in that respect. Had the writer thrown in a couple more unexpected twists and turns, it would have been a much more compelling film. Not bad though, not bad at all. The writer just needs to remember that unless his film takes us where we haven't been before, we aren't going to remember it.",1129420800,,871,4.2155688622754495
1541191,1,B00005JOO3,"Well done, great suspense, good acting,not overdone. good camera work, audio was excellent, sufficent lighting, the story had three important parts, a opening establishing shot to get audience attention, good story line, and a good conclusion.

1541193,4,B00005JOO3,"I liked this film - the concept and follow-through was excellent as far as the story and the talent of the actress, but it was so darned dark throughout I could barely see the action.  More attention should have been paid to appropriate lighting and this would have been rated 5 stars.",1129334400,,285,4.480769230769231
1541194,2,B00005JOO3,"Okay, the movie was started off well.  The hair down part really put me on the edge of my seat.  But the protagonist!  She does nothing but scream and cry!  She calls her boyfriend, but not the police?!  I'm all for sad ending as long as they are satisfying.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that the movie needed more more character development and character resourcefulness--even if she does die or get raped or whatever in the end.",1129334400,,436,4.3875
1541195,2,B00005JOO3,I hope the film i better than that short clip. I might want to see the whole movie to get the jist of the film.,1129334400,,111,3.48

1541197,4,B00005JOO3,"I know this was a horror movie and by default should be dark.  But there needed to be some mood lighting, not just no lighting.  The subject matter was ok and the storyline, although certainly not orriginal, was ok, and the actress was above average.  I felt that this story needed that twist at the end to make it a five star movie.",1129075200,,333,4.253968253968254
1541198,2,B00005JOO3,"I think they must of just watched Scream 1.  The beginning with Drew Barrymore.  This time the killer was on the net instead of on the phone.

Awesome they shot it under $100.  Must have a lot of friends.  Great production value.",1129075200,,229,4.357142857142857
1541199,3,B00005JOO3,"This movie will definitely make you think twice about IM'ing with strangers. The movie has a professional quality to it. I think these people might get far in the business if they keep it up, it's just not my cup of tea.",1129075200,,220,4.261904761904762
1541262,1,B00005JOO3,"Sorry, I didn't like it.  I got tired of the darkness after 3 minutes.",1129075200,,70,4.0
1541263,5,B00005JOO3,"I just thought that it was funny. I am in the stages of planning a movie just like this, not a short necesarily, but still. Cute girl + instant messenger service + psycho maniac killer = suspenseful thriller. I guess you beat me to it.

Yeah, the plot is not 100% original, but what movie has a completely 100% original plot anymore? Also, keep in mind the saying, ""Great minds think alike.""

I agree with the other viewers when it comes to the fact that the film is a little too dark, although I didn't take off for this because I feel that this may be at least partially because the film has been compressed for the internet and is being viewed in a small space. Also, the background for Amazon.com is white which I am sure probably doesn't help matters that much. Perhaps if I was viewing this on my TV player at home things would look better.

I really liked how you could build up the suspense in such short amount of time. One of the things that realy helps this is the sound you chose to use for the instant messenger program. I found it to be really effective and I belive that it is a key ingredient for this film and one that will probably be overlooked by many. At fuirst it sounds like just any ordinary computer beep, but by the end it's frightening.

The actress did a great job as well. Kudos to her on an oustanding preformance. As stated earlier, it is really difficult to carry a movie like this (or any other movie for that matter) almost entirely by yourself.

The first time I watched this, at the very end, even though I knew it was coming, I had to cover my eyes. That's a good sign.

Hope to see more from you in the future.",1128988800,3,1648,4.232484076433121
1541264,4,B00005JOO3,"I was really impressed by the tension that was built up in just 7 minutes.  This short film tapped into fears that many have about the Internet, specifically being located by some horrid unknown person via the Net.  Kudos for playing on our fears and laying it out so well.",1128988800,2,273,4.44
1541265,3,B00005JOO3,"Richter's Agenda is a dark and disturbing suspense thriller marred by a certain emptiness at its core.  The film itself is in Black & White and underlit.  This is quite effective, visually.  But the thin characterization of the victim (perhaps a consequence of the short format) ruins the sequence where she is supposed to be terrified.  It really has something to do with the story of her ""kinda"" boyfriend that she doesn't go into enough to make us feel for her as a person.  Yet there is enough creepiness in this work to recall the dark work of David Lynch (Lost Highway) and even Mulholland Drive, I just wish there could have been more attention to the characterization of the victim- before her untimely demise.",1128988800,2,718,4.712
1541266,3,B00005JOO3,"Yes, it was suspenseful for a while, but we've seen it all before.  Just a rehash of the blond hottie gets stalked and the ending was stupid.  I'd be interested in seeing what you can do if you got a bit more creative...",1128988800,,220,4.093023255813954
1541267,5,B00005JOO3,"This movie's genius is in  the actress. This movie is played in her face. It is so realistic, it brings to mind the simplistic terror of Wait Until Dark. It's that good.",1128988800,2,169,4.28125
1541268,4,B00005JOO3,"Solid thriller work here.  I was into this one as I watched it.  I wanted to know what was going to happen.  It made me think, ""Why her?  Who is the attacker?  How is this all happening?""  In short, I wanted to know more of the story.  Yeah, there are some holes in the small details.  That doesn't bother me so much if you're telling the rest of your story well.  While I don't know if this idea warrants a feature-length treatment, a longer version of this could be cool.",1128988800,,473,4.166666666666667
1541269,1,B00005JOO3,"Not a very great movie. I really don't buy the scenes where the

hacker is manipulating the computers state.

The only thing I enjoyed was the over the shoulder shot where we see her on the screen.

The IM sounds were horrible and should really not be used that much. I almost had to turn off the movie because of this.

Not much Hitchcock in this.

1541271,4,B00005JOO3,The acting was good; it is always tough to do a scene alone. I thought that the actress was successful in creating the tension necessary for this scene.

1541345,2,B00005JOO3,"This film lured me into a genre I never watch. I get creeped out easily and therefore avoid these types of movies. With that being said, thank you for letting me off the hook with the ending. I could've walked away from that completely spooked and computer phobic but instead, you went for an ending that wouldn't scare a paranoid schizophrenic. For shame, this film has now given me the false security of a thriller that doesn't thrill. Maybe I can watch these types of movies from now on.

1541349,1,B00005JOO3,"I don't know why this in the top five, there is nothing enjoyable about it. It rips off so many horror movies its almost a parody. If fact I saw a movie called ""3 Blind Mice"" this has the same exact plot, but was a lot more entertaining because you know why its all happening, who is behind the murders and why, and what the girl has done to have the killer chouse her for his next victim... even the whole closing of the blinds and the web cam thing was in it... And half the time you couldn't make out what was going on because it was so dark, I understand it happens at night, but there is a thing known as contrast lighting... no ""true"" horror movie fan should give this more than one star, if they do, they truly have no clue what they are talking about... I wish I could have skipped this piece of crap altogether. At least Duel at the red table, was something new... this was just awful... the director needs to go back to film school and study a bit more before he wastes his time with another film... and next time come up with you own story and stop stealing from other movies... and get a DP who knows what he is doing",1128729600,,1129,4.09009009009009

1541351,4,B00005JOO3,Good idea and execution (no pun intended). Nice to see a suspense film with a running time of only 7 minutes that holds your interest. Didn't really care for the ending. Maybe something a bit more Twilight Zone-ish would've been more satisfying...,1128729600,3,247,4.904761904761905
1541409,3,B00005JOO3,"Production quality was good. Acting was good. But, as far as the story goes, so what? I don't know who the murderer was. I don't see a motive (other than to terrorize someone--but, if that's the case, the use of the internet is needless). Unplugging the computer makes me think there's something more to the story (another dimension is introduced), but the killer is just some random guy...  a disconnect is created because we end up finding out that there's nothing extraordinary going on after all... kind of a let down.

The movie maker's message of ""beware of accepting random instant messages"" is no different than, ""don't talk to strangers."" The fact of the matter is, 99% of all people are kind and not a threat to our own well-being... we're actually more alike than we are different. But, because we're ""programed"" by nature for self-preservation, we fear what we don't know. It's ""safe"" to do so.

So, although the message in this short film is understandable, it needlessly keeps people distant from one another. It says, ""Don't know someone, fear them."" That can easily be transitioned to, ""Don't understand someone, fear them... don't understand their background, fear them... don't understand the way they look.. the way they think... they way they dress and act... fear them.""

Don't get me wrong, this film doesn't  create or define these types of flaws in human nature, but, it does re-enforce them.",1128729600,,1416,4.907949790794979

(being a film major at NYU) just wanted to let you know that the other competititors... well actually just the ping-pong flick are leaving these 1 star nasty reviews to every other competitior and 5 stars to themselves.

1541478,3,B00005JOO3,"I think this film is a definite top five for the contest.  For me, it places third just behind ""Battaglia"" and ""Meter Maids"".  This film definitely has it high points.  The line ""I liked it the other way"" refering to the girls hair was absolutely chilling.  I think the story was well developed and the girl did a great job acting, showing her fear.  As for the low points, the film just seemed as if it had no lighting.  I think the end was a little disappointing when the psycho attacks the girl.  I am not suggesting that this film needs gore or anything but the opportunity of scarring the you know what out of the audience was there, just not used.  Overall good effort and as Emeril would say, kick it up a notch.  BAM!!!",1128556800,2,727,4.286764705882353

You shouldn't be able to make a film ""plodding"" in under 7 minutes, but this one managed.

Point is, unless there's a cool payoff or smart twist that actually explains what is happening, then it's bad and annoying. I was certainly in suspence, the feel of the movie was good. But the guy just came out of nowhere with no explanation of how he got there or why he wanted to harm her. It was a copout, and therefore, I disliked it.",1128556800,,484,4.329670329670329

I think now that I get it though, the killer is streaming murders over the internet.  Even though we have seen a hot girl get killed by a crazy murderer a million times before, I think this one was pretty well done. The IM sound really worked well to build tension. After watching the bunch, I think this one stands out on another level of both production value and directing. I do not believe that it only costs a hundred dollars to make, impossible!

1541537,5,B00005JOO3,"The least contrived of all the finalists' films, Richter's Agenda effortlessly pulls you into the world of the film.  Filmmaking is at its best when the viewer is able to enjoy what's on screen while momentarily forgetting the effort and techniques that went into it, and Paul Matusheski does this very well.  It is incredibly difficult to make something look that easy.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of this film is the acting.  More than anything else, Mandy Henderson makes this film what it is.  Not only does she make her character perfectly believeable, but she is able to create fear, empathy and emotion in the viewer.  In a film with only one actor, the actor must be excellent, and Ms. Henderson is definitely that.  Great work!",1128556800,,736,4.7936507936507935

1541545,1,B00005JOO3,"The girl was great, so she gets the award for best actress.  However, this thing went wrong in the middle.  It should have had the ""unknown bad guy turns out to be harmless"" theme, or some humurous twist like her roommate being in the drawer or something.  Instead, she gets beat to hell in the end by some thug; too dark and worn out to be sure.  Now it could serve as a great public service announcement for careful AIM useage, but this is no fun.  I really was hoping for a cute twist in the end, or at least her boyfriend or someone comes in and saves the day.

Bottom line, if you're going to keep making the computer turn on supernaturally, then you need to explain it with some pseudo-supernatural villian in the end. Or at least have Barney the Dinosaur burst in and sing her happy birthday!

Good use of vfx -- e.g., the ""real time"" action in computer monitor = eery.  Wasn't crazy about the ending -- seeing the actual ""stalker"" get the girl.  If you insisted on including him, would have prefered something less traditional/cliche, such as the women getting the best of the predator. [Why are the victims always women!

1541619,3,B00005JOO3,"I grew up during the heyday of teenage slasher movies. I was four years old when the genre was started in 1978 with John Carpenter's masterful ""Halloween,"" and in my early twenties when it was giving its last dying breaths with such junk as 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" and 1995's ""Halloween 6."" During that period, Hollywood produced a seemingly endless stream of graphically violent, brainless movies where the only goal was to kill as many people in as many grotesque manners as possible. Young audiences ate it up for years, but as the eighties turned into the nineties, their appetites began to wan.

Now, almost twenty years after it was all started, Prevalent Sense Films revs it up again with ""Richter's Agenda,"" a nineties-style teenage slasher movie with just enough tongue-in-cheek understanding of its own silliness to make it gruesomely fun without being insulting.

The movie starts with a brilliantly realized set-piece involving a teenage girl getting spooky instant messages when she is home alone. The entire sequence was obviously inspired by 1979's ""When A Stranger Calls,"" quickly making clear that ""Richter's Agenda"" is not a particularly original movie.

Of course, because its genre is already so overloaded, there's really no way it could be original. Therefore, Prevalent Sense Films wisely decided to borrow from other, well-known slasher pics, and twist them to its own liking. This achieves two things: first, it allows them to parody and mock the ridiculousness of the genre (such as when a kid is watching ""Halloween"" yelling at a victim to look behind her while he himself is being stalked from behind), and secondly, it allows them to generate real chills and some genuine scares by using what has worked before. Prevalent Sense Films' screenplay lives and dies by the rules written years before. They do not try to hide that fact

Prevalent Sense Films, which has had an uneven career making horror movies, is back in rare form behind the camera. They use every trick in the book to milk new life from the mad killer story, and are more than often successful.

One thing I noticed missing from ""Richter's Agenda"" was some of the inventive splatter effects pioneered by people like Tom Savini and Rick Baker. Apparently, the MPAA made Prevalent Sense Films make major cuts to some of the gorier scenes in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.

I guess some things never change.",1128384000,,2421,4.9507389162561575
1541620,1,B00005JOO3,"I was impressed with the acting and production quality, especially considering the budget and time constraints. But where was the suspense? Where was the 'hook'? Films this short work far better as satire and parody, than real suspense.

7941095,4,B00005JOO3,"Other reviewers site this film as predictable and cliched, nevertheless, it was well paced and acted.  It's more difficult to create a suspenseful sequence than it looks. I give it points for using ordinary computer sounds (bleeps!) to punctuate the

scariness of the girl's predicament.  Several holes in the plot(e.g. how does computer turn itself on when she doesn't even bother to turn on a light - shades of Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween! - don't diminish the fact that it is suspenseful.

The director does a spectacular job creating a claustrophic atmosphere, and the lead actress is without a doubt the best in all the shorts I've seen on Amazon in both competitions.  You guys should be really proud of what you've accomplished here; your place in the final five is well-deserved.

Suspense takes time and I am impressed at how well paced this short film is. The shots are well composed and the lighting, although dark at times, is effective in creating a dense, shadowy, almost claustrophobic atmosphere. The ending shot is a masterstroke of timing, sound, and imagery.

The fact that this short film was made on such a small budget in such a short amount of time is a credit to the talented filmmakers.
