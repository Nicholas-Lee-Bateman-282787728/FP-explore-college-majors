6020125,5,B00FQI1R4Y,"I like other Pokemon fans saw this movie on Cartoon Network. I liked it a lot, but like the Keldeo movie it was too short, but that's likely because in Japan it was accompanied with the Pikachu/Eeveelution short we Americans won't see for a while.

But I am posting this to send a message to the people giving it low ratings. The Mewtwo in this movie is not the same one from the first movie/Mewtwo Returns. Unlike the games there can be more than 1 of a Legendary Pokemon in the Anime Canon. Did the fans complain like this when the Lucario movie was released and the Mew in it was different? I don't think it was, so to the old fans calm down, and watch it again now that you know this Mewtwo is not the original one.",1383609600,33,719,4.172661870503597
6020126,2,B00FQI1R4Y,"This movie is just a big middle finger to the original fans who have been watching since the very beginning. In this movie the creators choose to completely erase the other two movies that Mewtwo was in. Yes, Mewtwo wiped out the memories of Ash and of all his friends in the first movie, but in Mewtwo Returns he clearly lets them keep their memory of it. In this movie Mewtwo's origin is retold and COMPLETELY different. On top of this, Mewtwo is voiced by a female. Mewtwo is a gender less pokemon, but it has been voiced by deep male voices in the past. If anything, this change shows how much effort was put into erasing the two previous movies that feature Mewtwo. Is this movie all bad? No. The fighting scenes are pretty awesome. That is the only good thing about this movie.",1383523200,3,783,4.406896551724138
6020127,5,B00FQI1R4Y,As a person who's been a Pokemon Anime fan since the beginning I have to say this movie does not dissapoint. For the people who have been saying that they don't understand why Mewtwo sounds different or any other thing shouldnt hate it for that. If your a Pokemon fan this is a great movie to own. If it seems a little  confusing just do a little bit of research and everything will make sense. I highly recommend this movie.,1383350400,6,425,4.3125
6020128,1,B00FQI1R4Y,"Ok, so I didn't buy the movie (THANK GOD), but I saw it on TV from start to finish and I was pissed. MEWTWO IS NOT A FEMALE, HE IS MALE, and he doesn't even remember Ash and Ash doesn't remember. If you're going to use a legendary pokemon in a movie and it was already in one then they need to stick to the previous movie. Mewtwo was so ugly with a female voice. The male voice it originally had was perfect,I would go as far as to say it made him seem regal. Don't buy this movie whatever you do, yeah the story line was pretty good and had potential if they had followed the story.

(EDITED)I will say that perhaps children who've never seen the first 2 movies that featured Mewtwo will like it or they may like it despite those movies, it is after all a kids anime. But for old school Pokefans I don't reccomend this movie. I've seen all the Pokemovies and loved them but I absolutely hated this one. All because what they did with Mewtwo ruined it for me. As the person who gave it a 2 star rating said, it was a big middle finger to the first 2 movies.",1383091200,5,1057,4.057416267942584
6020129,1,B00FQI1R4Y,"Ok, firts off mewtwo is one of the greatest legendaries even though he's technically cloned from a legendary. He stared in the first pokemon movie and again in a sequel; mewtwo returns. But now they introcduced mewtwo in a new movie, and he isn't even the same one!! It's female now?! REALLY!? How is that even possible!? Aparently it looks like this mewtwo was genetically created by people from mew. But after it escaped it was helped by wild pokemon and found a place to belong among them. So when one of the genesects call out that it ""wants to go home"", mewtwo come along to help them. The red genesect sees all as it's enemy and doesn't like to be told to follow mewtwo and fights it. And later when ash and pikachu meet with mewtwo again, they don't even recognize each other giving further proof this is somehow a new mewtwo.

In the end of Pokemon the first movie:mewtwo strikes, mewtwo forces everyone to forget about him, mew and the other clone pokemon. Then in the sequel Mewtwo Returns, he still remembers ash even though ash doesn't remember him. After ash helping mewtwo (i won't spoil it) he and the other pokemon convince mewtwo to let them keep their memories this time of what happened.

Now enter this mewtwo. No connection with the previous one except that it's a mewtwo..... I hate this movie by far the most of any pokemon movie ever made!!! NEVER AGAIN!!",1382659200,8,1379,4.556451612903226

6020143,4,B00FQI1R4Y,"I love the pokemon movies, and this one was no exception. The only confusing part of this movie is that mewtwo shows up, but he doesn't remember meeting ash and Pikachu from Pokmon The First Movie. So, I just figured it was a different mewtwo?",1431302400,2,243,4.4222222222222225
6020144,5,B00FQI1R4Y,"Mewtwo, its heart having been softened by the selfless example of Ash Ketchum back in the eastern Kanto region, has now traveled to the western region of Johto in search of a place unreachable to the prying eyes and harsh judgments of humans for the sake of the band of cloned Pokmon, whose welfare Mewtwo is entirely concerned with. Mewtwo eventually finds the perfect hideaway: a huge mountain named Mount Quena, surrounded by steep cliffs that are practically impossible to scale, but in its crater is a freshwater lake and a forest that is home to many Bug Pokmon. This is a perfect fit for Mewtwo's band, so they settle in the top of Mt. Quena and begin a new, safe life. Mewtwo, feeling that clones do not belong in the outside world because they were not born in it, watches over as their guardian. Mewtwo seems particularly close to the Pikachu and Meowth clones, spending most of its private time with them, possibly reflecting how important their templates were in its change of heart.
Giovanni, however, is determined to possess Mewtwo once again, and has been planning a militaristic assault upon wherever Mewtwo has settled to take the Pokmon back for himself. He at last locates Mewtwo in its new mountain retreat, so the Team Rocket Combat Unit heads toward Mt. Quena.
Ash and his friendson their Pokmon journey as alwaysare passing through an area around Mt. Quena called Purity Canyon, which is known as Johto's greatest natural wonder. Unfortunately, they miss the only bus that goes through the area and an unpredicted typhoon forces them to stay at a lodge at the foot of the mountain with a woman who could not board the full bus. On the road, the bus is swept up high powerful winds, but is set down by Mewtwo's powers, much to the confusion of its riders. In Mewtwo's lair, Pikachutwo questions this action, which Mewtwo explains was to prevent rescuers from jeopardizing the clones' seclusion. Meowthtwo suggests it may also have been done out of compassion, of which Mewtwo says it has none for humans.
Back at the lodge, Pokmon naturalist Luna Carson explains that the only ways through the valley are a canoe ride down the river or the monthly bus service. Later, Luna serves them fresh water from Purity River, and everyone but Ash is amazed by its taste. With no other option for transportation, the group leave that night, taking the canoes downstream. Along the way, they come across the Bug Pokmon Ledian, Kakuna, Weedle, Pinsir, and Beedrill, the last of which causes Misty to frantically paddle back upstream. Back at the lodge, Brock suggests they scale Mt. Quena, but Luna warns that is impassible despite featuring beautiful Clarity Lake in its crater. A knock on the door brings new lodge inhabitants: medical researcher Cullen Calix and a spunky girl from the Pokmon Institute, Domino. Cullen says he is studying the medicinal properties of Purity River water and wants to explore Mt. Quena, which Luna laments would bring tourists and destruction to the ecosystem.
Suddenly, Team Rocket announces their presence with firecrackers and their motto. James grabs Pikachu with an electricity-absorbing whip and escapes with Jessie, and Meowth in their rocket-powered balloon, but the turbulent winds cause them to lose control and push them toward Mt. Quena. The group equips climbing gear and chases after them, avoiding gusty winds and even a falling boulder. Team Rocket's balloon swings by and hooks their climbing rope, dragging the group into the air. Domino spots Mewtwo in Mt. Quena through her binoculars and transmits a video feed to none other than Giovanni. Upon seeing the approaching Combat Unit, Domino climbs up the rope past the others, lands in the balloon's basket, and reveals herself to be in league with Team Rocket as elite Agent 009, also known as The Black Tulip for her use of the flowers as weapons. Domino pops the balloon with one and sends everyone else plummeting onto the mountain while she returns via paraglider to Giovanni's large helicopter to report on Mewtwo's status.
Pikachu and Team Rocket end up separated from the others and quickly encounter the clones. Pikachu's clone attacks Pikachu for suddenly appearing, but Mewtwo forces it to stop. Agitated by the approaching humans, Pikachutwo rallies the other clones to fight back against the invading Combat Unit. Mewtwo stays behind with other clones and contemplates whether to stop the fighters from endangering themselves or letting them act freely. Ash and the other humans land unharmed, but separated from Pikachu by a lake. They use Bulbasaur and Chikorita's Razor Leaf to make a canoe and oars out of a fallen tree, and with it they traverse the lake to reach the island at the center of Mt. Quena's crater. They enter a natural sanctuary in the island, where Cullen discovers that the water inside could have a profound impact on medicine. Luna fears that any future human presence could taint the purity of the water and destroy the habitat.
Some of the clones imprison Jessie and James in a cave and head off with Pikachu and Meowth to fight Team Rocket's forces. However, as soon as the Pokmon land ashore, a Team Rocket helicopter appears and stuns the clones with energy blasts. An airship drops Team Rocket Pok Balls that capture most of the clones, and just as Pikachutwo is about to be caught by one, Pikachu deflects it with an electric attack. He also shocks Pikachutwo in order to invigorate it and escape, which Meowth emulates by scratching Meowthtwo's face. The four Pokmon flee from the helicopter's blasts, but find themselves trapped against a hill. A Shadow Ball saves the group from an incoming stun blast, revealing Mewtwo floating in the air behind the helicopter. Mewtwo frees the clone, disintegrates their Pok Balls, and throws another Shadow Ball, but the helicopter evades the attack.
Giovanni emerges on a platform to speak with Mewtwo, but the Pokmon refuses to go along with Giovanni's plans. The helicopter deploys two machines that surround Mewtwo and give it a powerful electric shock. Mewtwo pushes the machines into rock walls with its psychic power and defies Giovanni once more. Giovanni turns his attention to the island harboring the rest of the clones for phase two of the operation. Along with paragliding Team Rocket Grunts, Domino flies over using a jetpack and eventually comes across Ash's group, who are quickly restrained by metal rings to prevent their interference. Domino subdues the island's Pokmon with stunning tulips and restraining rings and reports her findings to Giovanni, who challenges Mewtwo to stop him. Mewtwo declares that it will protect the clones and telekinetically brings the other Pokmon to the island with it.
Soon, Domino, Mewtwo, and Giovanni meet on the island, at which point Giovanni tells Mewtwo that it must surrender. Mewtwo replies that it would rather leave this world than serve him, but Giovanni threatens to subject the other clones to experiments that would cause them to perish. Mewtwo then agrees. Giovanni reactivates the machines from earlier and tells Mewtwo to enter the energy field between them, which will harness Mewtwo's power and bend its will to his. Domino demonstrates Team Rocket's threat by firing blasts from her tulip at Pikachutwo. With Mewtwo trapped by the force of the machines' energy and his operation successful, Giovanni makes plans to build a Team Rocket laboratory on the island to create an army of powerful clone Pokmon. Mewtwo ceases its struggle just as Giovanni states that it will be his tool to rule the world. The other characters and Pokmon are then locked away in a prison cell, where Ash is reunited with Pikachu.
Outside, construction is well under way on the Team Rocket base. In a phone call, Giovanni tells Domino that Mewtwo's brain waves are resisting the machine's influence at a rate that would destroy its body before giving in. The industrial waste from the base attracts the ire of Mt. Quena's resident Bug Pokmon: hundreds of Ledian, Butterfree, and Beedrill, whose lake water is now polluted. When the welders inside the facility are taken out by Butterfree's Sleep Powder, a dropped blowtorch ignites the fuel cells below and causes enormous chain explosions, one of which destroys the cell bars and frees the human and Pokmon prisoners. Luna and Cullen head toward the spring to check its purity.
Domino throws black tulips at a group of Ledian, but several Scyther slice the weapons up. She then uses a rod-like tulip to fend off an attacking Scyther and vault over the Ledian swarm. After being forced to mop the floor earlier, Jessie and James enjoy Domino slipping and falling head-first into a bucket of water.
Ash, Pikachu, Misty, Brock, Pikachutwo, Meowth, and Meowthtwo find Mewtwo. Everyone but Misty tries to free Mewtwo by tackling one of the machines, but it only tips over and maintains the energy field. Mewtwo resorts to using the last of its power to overload the machines. Pikachu and Pikachutwo use Thunderbolt on one of them, which explodes. The field breaks, and Mewtwo collapses to the ground. The other machine appears to malfunction and self-destruct. Before they can take Mewtwo to the spring to recover, Giovanni appears with Team Rocket and claims that Mewtwo belongs to him. Brock and Misty release all their Pokmon to fight, and the clone and Bug Pokmon show up as well. Meowth flees the scene with Jessie and James while Ash takes Mewtwo away by himself.
As Ash, Bulbasaur, and Chikorita transport Mewtwo to safety, Mewtwo asks why Ash is helping it. Ash replies that Mewtwo saving Pikachu is one reason, and at Mewtwo's questioning, goes on to say that you do not need a reason to help someone in trouble. Mewtwo reflects that Ash may be one-of-a-kind, but Ash says that everyone is. They reach the heart of the mountain, and despite Cullen's protests that Mewtwo may contaminate the spring, Ash throws Mewtwo in because it needs the water's healing power most. Since the water heals it like it does other Pokmon, Mewtwo realizes that it does belong in this world. A blast from a helicopter announces Giovanni's sudden presence, but a rejuvenated Mewtwo rises from the water to protect the land it calls home. Mewtwo causes a great blue light to shoot up from the entire lake and pierce the heavens.
Night has fallen, and Team Rocket wake up from unconsciousness in a dry crater. Underground, Mewtwo explains to the other humans that it has moved the lake and spring inside Mt. Quena for greater protection. When Mewtwo decides to erase the memories of everyone involved, Meowth and the other Pokmon object, arguing that the past forms part of a living creature's identity and it is entitled to it. Misty and Brock add that forgetting the past does not change it and everyone deserves to know where they came from. Mewtwo changes its mind, stating that we should be able to look to the past just as much as the future, and the shame of others' wrongdoing is theirs alone. A group of Butterfree spread powder enhanced with Mewtwo's psychic abilities to erase the memories of the Team Rocket operatives as well as Luna and Cullen, whose well-meaning desire to research the spring may put it in jeopardy. Like the Team Rocket trio before them, Ash and his friends board a Pikachu balloon to leave Mt. Quena. Mewtwo earnestly thanks them for their help and departs with all the cloned Pokmon to live elsewhere as natural Pokmon in the wild.
Some time later, as Ash, Misty, and Brock walk through a city, Ash hears Mewtwo's voice, but is uncertain whether it was real or just a memory. The Narrator concludes the movie with the rumors of a Pokmon who traverses a faraway city at night.",1426636800,,11684,4.898536092882383
6020145,3,B00FQI1R4Y,"First, I'm going to address the only real issue I had with the film.
A problem that some people had was Mewtwo becoming female, while remaining the same singular Mewtwo of the series' canon storyline. Bear in mind, of course, that the movies tend to be standalone, and rarely actually plug into the show. (excepting at least the very first film, ironically about Mewtwo, which linked in with the Viridian City gym sequences). I'd be fine excusing it's female voice. It's a Psychic type, and telepathy is not something most humans would be able to understand, to name one easy excuse. So changing it's voice is not a big deal. My issue comes from that it essentially retconned the prior Mewtwo involvement in the animated Pokemon series. I recall the end of the first film had Mewtwo coming around, and understanding that Pokemon and people could live together peacefully. Thanks to a memory wipe, Mewtwo and Mew departed with a new outlook. This Genesect film centers around Mewtwo's psuedo-hatred and distrust of humans. It's pretty irritating that Mewtwo got rewritten this way. The voice I can get over, despite not liking it... but the change of Mewtwo's character was kind of annoying. There's also Mewtwo's bizarre and illogical abuse of mega-evolution. It seemingly jumps in and out of it's mega form with little to no reason, let alone any kind of pattern that could be followed to make sense of it. It just kind of goes in and out on a whim, both in and out of battle.

Apart from that, the movie was well made, and entertaining. My favorite thing in any Pokemon film (honestly one of my favorite things about the tv show), is the variety of different Pokemon that get featured. While the storyline is a little sudden and doesn't have a particularly strong build up, it follows a regularly used formula for Pokemon. Some people don't like this, but I don't mind it. Bad guys come, token bad guy that's not a bad guy, and redemption via friendship. Again, I don't mind the regularly reused formula, myself. The voice acting was just as good as any other Poke-film or series.

Summing everything up: I liked the film, despite a few discrepancies that were a little off putting. I'd say it's worth having in one's collection, though it's far from my top 5. For the right price, I'd recommend it. The side Pokemon are always worth it. Like Sableye. They make friends with a Sableye, and that's just fun.",1426636800,,2408,4.703791469194313

6020163,3,B00FQI1R4Y,"They say if it aint broken don't fix it. Genesect and the Legend Awakened was the 10th highest grossing film in Japan in 2013 and the Pok&eacute;mon movies generally tend to do very well in their home country. Unfortunately the formula is getting really stale. What I won't say is that its a bad looking film. The design and animation are often stunning but Pok&eacute;mon just doesnt seem to be able to produce a story worthy of the visuals. The story can be summed up very simply. Five genetically created Genesect escape and decide to set up residence in the power plant of New York City (I thought Pok&eacute;mon always used fictional cities). The Genesect attack dozens of non-legendary Pok&eacute;mon in Central Park (Pok&eacute;mon Hills) until MewTwo arrives to defend the other Pok&eacute;mon and an all out Pok&eacute;mon on Pok&eacute;mon battle ensues. The damage done by the Genesect threatens to blow up the power plant so Ash and friends show up to save the day and thanks to the power of friendship everything turns out well. If anyone considers this a spoiler they haven't seen another Pok&eacute;mon movie because this is literally the end of every movie.

If someone had this playing in the background and isn't really paying attention it probably looks like a decent movie. It certainly looks good but there really is almost no story. Its just endless scenes of Pok&eacute;mon unleashing blasts from their mouths or kicking up sandstorms or releasing balls of energy. Team Rocket appears but as always have no impact on the story and are completely superfluous. Even Ash and friends do almost nothing except gawk at the battling and Ash, as always, tries to talk everyone into being friends. In this case its not even Ash who saves the day and events would likely have preceded exactly the same even if he hadnt put in an appearance. Most of the voice actors are from the television show but there are some unfortunate additions. Mewtwo being voiced by a female doesnt bother me but the voice actress is terrible and gives no gravitas to arguably the most powerful of all Pok&eacute;mon. One of the Genesect befriends Ash and has the most irritating baby voice, constantly whining about going home.

I had been giving the Pok&eacute;mon movies better and better ratings but with the last three movies it seems like the writers have completely run out of ideas. The whole story could be written on a napkin. An argument could be made that the movie is made for kids but there are many kids movies that also appeal to adults and have some actual substance. Just look at the movies of Hayao Miyazaki. Im not complaining because I dislike Pok&eacute;mon, quite the opposite. Id like to see the series continue indefinitely but if they want to expand the audience beyond Japanese and children below the age of 10 they're really going to need to add a story to the beautiful animation. I gave Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice three stars because the story was so shallow but this one is even worse and doesnt have the benefit of the awesome Kyurem. Ill give this one three stars also but only on the strength of the animation.",1392768000,6,3139,4.779005524861878
6020164,3,B00FQI1R4Y,"While the movie itself was good,  it was all that was really included on the DVD which was a shame. They could've included the option to have other languages like Japanese with English subtitles for one thing. My biggest gripe however, is that there was a half hour prequel to this movie that aired recently, it would've made perfect sense to either add it to newer versions of the DVD or make an updated version that includes it. It's upsetting to see that the only other feature included, was the trailer for this specific movie, which seems pretty silly.

What I didn't enjoy was Mewtwo. The reviewers that are bashing the other reviewers for disliking Mewtwos new voice are...well, silly. Yes more than one legendary is allowed in a Pokmon movie, even the same legendary Pokmon. We get that. We accept. Throw in 1,000 Rayquaza's, doesn't bother me. What is upsetting to me and the many other fans is that...they erased the Mewtwo lore that began with Pokmon the first movie and replaced it with this garbage. Going in to this movie, after hearing Mewtwo's new voice I thought, ""surely they'll explain this. Maybe another Mewtwo was crafted."" Nope! It was the only one made, according to their ""explaining"". So really. All of the fans of old...all of our memories of Mewtwo and remembering how he was made...trashed.

Do you get us now, masters of Pokmon? Who claim that Mewtwo can have the voice of a girl? Do you think it's gender that's really the problem? It's not. It's the fact that they ruined what they had built up and made in the first place.

Besides...if gender was an issue...wouldn't we have been upset that Ash was played by a girl? Silly people.",1388361600,,1271,4.690582959641255
6020173,5,B00FQI1R4Y,"This is the 16th Pokemon movie, and the final in the ""Black & White"" series. Like all Pokemon movies, this one is one of the best movies, ever. Mewtwo's appearance in the film is what the audience (that would be you and me, and others) wanted to see. Great film to see!",1388361600,,269,4.1923076923076925
6020174,3,B00FQI1R4Y,"I am a huge Pokemon fan , I have all the movies including the mew two returns , so this one like the 15th movie is rather bland and not up to the first 5 movies . With that said , this movie is not horrible but its not great , i watched it with an opened mind and knew it was not going to be no Pokemon 2000 or Pokemon the first movie , but they are shorter and shorter and the story seems to be following a recipe that is rather stale by now and they need to really do some major new writing .

Not the best but not bad give a try see for yourself .",1387411200,,550,3.5833333333333335
6020175,5,B00FQI1R4Y,"With the simple overall theme of ""finding out where you belong,"" this is another great Pokmon movie. We are introduced to a five-team with a red leader, the genosect, created by humans like Mewtwo was back when the franchise started branching out into film. They see no one as their friends and seek to find their home, despite the world having changed (obviously) a lot in 300 million years.

The Mewtwo in this movie is certainly not the same one from the first film or the returns special. This one is obviously female, and has a second transformation form. It has similar origins, created by humans, but it is obvious as the backstory shows it being tortured and eventually breaking free, where the original, ""male"" Mewtwo simply rejected and killed it's creators before anything like ""tests"" ever happened.

This one film's flaw is not acknowledging the past Mewtwo. Ash seems to realize it's a Mewtwo but it never goes further than that. Basically this new female Mewtwo understands how the genosect feel, and does whatever it can to try to help. But the red geneosect leader is destructive and can also control the others. They end up in a created eco-system in the middle of a city. Huge pluses are deserved for the look of the city-it looks like a combination of Tokyo and New York. It is no way identical to the tons of same-looking cities from prior movies (heroes and Illusions towns/cities looked the same, original and darkai also looked the same).

After some pretty cool battles and differences being set aside, and the terror of the entire city exploding, things turned out well as expected. There is fire, water, genosect seeds/trees growing, and a plummeting to the earth-it's all well animated too.

I'd leave it at that but the hatred for this new Mewtwo should be addressed further. Yes, she's not the same one from prior films. She was made in a similar fashion, probably with the same idea in mind, with pretty much the same results (save not trying to destroy the world like the male Mewtwo from the first Pokmon movie). Some complain this means ""anyone can make a Mewtwo."" For one, it's been told that Porygon was a human created Pokmon, and that was one of the original 150 from when the series has it's beginnings. Since the creation of the original Mewtwo we've seen resurrections of many pre-historic Pokmon in many different fashions, ranging from cloning to machines/magic, and more. It is hardly ""impossible"" to make clones or to resurrect Pokmon in the world Pokmon has created. Considering the makers of the series themselves have stated it's supposed to have been over five years in the ""series timeline,"" it's no wonder someone else made a Mewtwo or tried it with other Pokmon (the genosect are more advanced, they added weapons on their shoulders/backs). Of course some scientists would try it again, why not? The answer is because they are obviously not all there and just want to create life and feel they can do whatever they want with it, we know that never works out.

Now what I'd like to really see; female Mewtwo meets male Mewtwo. This would be awesome, and we all know it. Move past the silliness of hating on female Mewtwo, who is truly awesome and beautiful, and enjoy this movie as one of the better ones in the long series.",1386979200,2,3275,4.718531468531468
6020176,4,B00FQI1R4Y,"I liked the film in the first place, I am annoyed as i contacted customer service asking if the promo card was included in their copies as the film can't be bought here in the UK got my copy today and no promo card....thanks a bunch....",1386892800,,236,4.1521739130434785
6020177,5,B00FQI1R4Y,"I see that a lot of people are complaining about the voice change of Mewtwo and to be honest it's not that big of a deal. I mean if you think about it, it's been years since the Pokmon movie special that Mewtwo appeared and voiced in so of course the voice is going to be different. Though I do agree that they could've at least had the same gender voice instead of changing it to a female, but like I said it's not that big of a deal.

The only part in this movie that I was struggling with was the fact that they changed Mewtwo's past. We all know that Ash and Mewtwo have met before and that, even though his memory was erased the first time, the second time Ash encountered Mewtwo, Mewtwo didn't erase Ash's memories so he still remembers. Also we see that when Ash saw Mewtwo for th first time in this movie it seemed like he recognized it, but Mewtwo didn't recognize him and after that point it seemed like they just ignored the fact that Ash recognized/ knew Mewtwo in the first place. To be honest I wasn't thrilled about the writers changing Mewtwo's past and having it to where Ash never met Mewtwo before (even though we all know he clearly did), but I can't let that ruin the movie as a whole.

So over looking that part, the over all movie was great and I enjoyed every minute of it and will most defiantly be re-watching it :) All I have to say to people who haven't seen the movie yet is don't judge it by Mewtwo's new voice because that shouldn't matter in the long run (I mean Ash's voice changes every time he goes to a new region), and to focus on the movie as a whole when you rate it because this is a good movie :)",1385251200,3,1637,4.1125
6020178,1,B00FQI1R4Y,"This is the second Pokemon film I hated, the other being Giratina the Sky warrior. The reason I can't stand this film is because of Mewtwo's gender change! Mewtwo was a guy in the late 1990s. The guy Mewtwo everyone grew up with. I watched this on its premiere on Cartoon network and the first moment it I heard Mewtwo talking with a girl voice.

I was SHOCKED and disappointed. It was like...when I first saw Mewtwo before...she talked, all this happy music was ringing in my ears, after all these years Mewtwo is back...yay!

But when I heard the female voice...my happy music just went depressing and slow, like a record player breaking. The fact Mewtwo was changed into a girl in this one, REALLY gives Pokemon a bad name.

Someone at the company better do some serious explaining to the fans because this isn't right. They just tainted over 10 years of history on Mewtwo, history the fans followed and believed. Aside from the girl Mewtwo completely ruining the film, the rest of the film wasn't all that great. i was falling asleep through it even, and I'm a HUGE Pokemon fan, I got a huge collection, I watch it, play the games, big fan thats been a fan since it first came out in America.

But this...this was just a huge let down. If you're a recent Pokemon fan, it won't bother you as much, but if you're a 90s fan like me, don't watch it. Spare yourself from it.",1384041600,6,1373,4.41501976284585
