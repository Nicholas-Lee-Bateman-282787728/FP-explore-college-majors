6281376,5,B00IKVSE0Y,"Vincent Price stars in this campy funny science fiction movie. Just love the character he portrays as a Mad scientist who creates his girl bikini robots. His plan is to rob all the riches from the wealthy with his bikini robots. Then two bumbling heroes try to stop goldfoot.
The Second movie he comes back with his robots but as girl bombs.  He gets involved with the Chinese government to use exploding female robots to disrupt a scheduled NATO war-game by blowing up the various generals involved in the exercise. Goldfoot attempting to start World War 3 between Russia and the United States by dropping a nuclear bomb on Moscow. But then there is a girl chasing agent that plans to stop him

Love this movie and that fact that it is two movies, I have been looking for this two movies and found it in one dvd. Or course what can I say I love Vincent Price. :-)",1360108800,13,864,4.427672955974843
6281377,4,B00IKVSE0Y,"This is a good combo to get. I found ""Bikini Machine"" to be the better of the two In my opinion it has a better plot and writing. It has the very beautiful dark haired Susan Hart who gives an excellent performance; I think she's the star of the movie as much as Vincent Price. The rating for the double DVD is predominantly for it. The 2nd movie ""Girl Bombs"" had a good idea plot wise, but I think it was too disorganised. It has another lovely woman actress (her name escapes me but she's Italian) who does a great job; given the lines that she has. The inclusion of an Italian comedy duo kind mucks things up/contributes to the ""lost the plot"" feel. Having said that, if you wanted to see both movies and you don't want to buy them as separate DVD's; this double movie DVD is very good value for money. The DVD quality was good, but it's just the movies in real time; there are no Scene Selections or extra features. Even if you only wanted ""Bikini Machine"", you could still get this.",1359763200,3,986,4.278074866310161
6281378,5,B00IKVSE0Y,"These two movies are the apex of American International's gloriously idiotic series of widescreen, technicolor teen comedies of the Sixties that began with the Beach Party movies earlier in the decade. Maybe not the apex of quality, but certainly an apex of throwaway idiocy!  These are lots of fun.

I'm very happy to see that MGM saw fit to throw this double bill away on a TGG bargain bin release instead of going the much, MUCH more expensive Made-to-Order ""Archives"" route that is currently the only way to see many of their newly released reissues of cult classic films.  I suspect that this double bill had been prepared for MGM's Midnight Movies Double Feature series, but was shelved when MGM fell apart a couple of years ago.

6281379,4,B00IKVSE0Y,"I  love ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine.""  It has always  been one of my favoite comedies.  It's easy to see that much of Austin Powers  was based on this film. The whole FemBot thing was taken from this.  All of the actors, Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman are fantastic in this.  This film is a great satire on films like 007 and other spy films of the era.  The title sequence and title song is well worth the price alone.  Now.  ""Dr, Goldfoot and the girl bombs.""  Well  I have never seen it,  I don't think it had ever been released.  When I saw  this DVD in the $5 bin at Walmart I knew I had to get it, though I already have ""Bikini.""  To have both I thought was a great deal. I just watched ""Bomb"" last night.  I fell asleep.  It was dreadful.  As much as I love Mario Bava's horror films, he is not good with comedy.  The films is all over the place.  The plot?  Dr. Goldfoot is trying to kill all the men in NATO so he can stop some war games.  He sends out his girl bombs.  When they kiss the men, they explode.  Talk about your suicide bombers.  Of course the girls are robots. Oh and  Goldfoot  wants to drop a nuke on Russia and start a nuclear war.  Why?  I guess he thinks that will help him rule the world.  There is little or no background for the main charecter played by Fabian.  Only that he is a spy.  Dr. Goldfoot does not have his original henchman in this one.  He has some girl as his partner  who is not much of an actress. Her
name in the film is ""Hardjob.""  I guess it's suppose to be a take off on ""Oddjob"" from ""Goldfinger."" Her whole role in the film is to have her clothes ripped off.  And who is Franco snd Ciccio?  2 Itialian comedians? They are not funny at all.  And Price often turns to the camera and explains what is happeneing on screen.  Well have a decent screenplay and you'd not need this nonsense.  It is obovious that the film makers were way over  their heads and had no clue where the film was going.  So if you find this in the cheap bin at Walmart, yes get it. For ""Bikini""  not ""Bomb""

6281380,5,B00IKVSE0Y,"This double-bill of both AIP's Dr. Goldfoot series, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" and the DVD premiere in Reg. 1 of ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"", it's somewhat controversial sequel is a pleasant way to get both films in one's collection.  AIP got Vincent Price to appear in both films, ""Bikini Machine"" becoming the first production by AIP that had a million dollar budget.  Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman and Susan Hart also star and directed by veteran Norman Taurog (considered ""the star's director"" having directed 10 Elvis vehicles in his career, and which included an Oscar win for directing Jackie Cooper in ""Skippy"" in 1931 among many others).  Many of the successful plot mechanics of ""Bikini Machine"" were recruited to be included in the sequel ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"", but what happened was the producers decided to take advantage of tax write-off by having the production foreign made and it was considered a coup that famed horror director Mario Bava agreed to direct what would become his only comedy.  Besides Price, ""Girl Bombs"" included Fabian in the cast and Laura Antonelli (who would later hit it big in Italian movies) and the blundering Italian comedy team of Franco and Ciccio.  A lot of ""Girl Bombs"" fails, but it is not entirely as bad as critics of the film generally agree.  I think some of the Goldfoot plot mechanics, the obligatory chases, in ""Bikini Machine"" mostly with go carts, but Bava was terribly inventive to parodying itself in ""Girl Bombs"" with everything, even a big balloon.  A lot went wrong with the production of ""Girl Bombs"" which included their reportedly losing the soundtrack which had to be re-dubbed with the actors doing a lot of lip reading as the script went through many changes.  I still like ""Girl Bombs"" anyway and this is a good way to get a good copy of both films as it well presented thanks to TGG Direct.  And, too, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" was not exactly without fault as the prototype for success.  Both films are presented as letterboxed.",1348012800,30,2041,4.822349570200573

6281393,4,B00IKVSE0Y,"In ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" (1965), Dr. Goldfoot (Vincent Price) has invented an army of bikini-clad female robots, and programmed them to seek out rich men, and seduce them into signing over their all of their money.  Todd Armstrong (Dwayne Hickman) is the wealthy target of fem-bot Diane (Susan Hart).  Planning to foil Dr. Goldfoot's evil plan is secret agent Craig Gamble (Frankie Avalon).  The movie is a cross between ""Goldfinger"" and ""Beach Blanket Bingo.""  The beach movie actors and actresses making cameos in this movie include Annette Funicello, Aron Kincaid, Deborah Walley, and Harvey Lembeck (a/k/a Eric Von Zipper).  This fast-paced film is a lot of fun, and Vincent Price looks like he's having a blast spoofing his horror movie persona, especially in the torture chamber scene where he spoofs his character in ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  The beautiful women wearing gold bikinis make for great eye candy!  The movie was directed by Norman Taurog, who directed the movies ""The Stooge"" (with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), ""Visit To A Small Planet"" (with Jerry Lewis), and ""Blue Hawaii"" (with Elvis Presley).  I give ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" five stars.

Vincent Price reprised his role in ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"" (1966).  Because the first Dr. Goldfoot film was such a big hit in Italy, this sequel was filmed in Italy.  Dr. Goldfoot plans to take over the world by making his fem-bots bombs, designed to blow up high-ranking generals of NATO countries, by kissing them.  What a way to go!  Planning to foil Dr. Goldfoot's evil plan is disgraced secret agent Bill Dexter (Fabian).  Providing comic relief are two Italian comedic movie stars, Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia.  To me, they were about as funny as a heat rash.  The movie was directed by Mario Bava, who is best known for directing horror movies, such as ""Black Sabbath,"" ""Blood and Black Lace,"" and ""Planet of the Vampires.""  Mario is clearly out of his element, directing this spy spoof.  Because of Vincent Price, and the beautiful, bikini-clad women, I give ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"" three stars.  In addition, there are no theatrical trailers or bonus features of any kind.  Eight stars, divided by two movies, gives this double feature a total of four stars.",1454371200,2,2291,4.947643979057592

(First let me clarify that there is one disc, not two as in the product description, and these films are G-rated, not ""R"".)  The first film, ""Dr. G...and the Bikini Machine"", I give 4 stars. It is a piece of adolescent nostalgia with lots of craziness, eye candy, and San Francisco area scenery. The second movie, ""...and the Girl Bombs"" is a bomb...a bad bomb. I will give it 2 stars. The beautiful Laura Antonelli gets 10 stars while everything else about the film gets a negative 8 (thus resulting in 2 stars). The writing is bad, the story progression is bad, the acting is bad, the sets and effects are bad...you get the drift. What is also pathetic was the dubbing of most, if not all, of the language (apparently because of production problems). Vincent Price, Fabian, and Laura Antonelli couldn't save ""...the Girl Bombs"" from bombing out.

Most of the movie was slow and made little sense.  Was slightly painful to watch in spots. Whats sad is it had potential to be great.  Bombs was so bad I don't even know where to start.  None of the movie made any sense from the start. Why they wanted to get the Chinese guy for sitting in the park I have no clue.  The so called ""comedy team"" is soooo bad. They're not funny at all!!!  Just making stupid annoying faces that add NOTHING to the film.  The whole movie is dubbed over and is completely obvious and terribly done.

6281418,3,B00IKVSE0Y,"...is better than either of the two ""Dr. Goldfoot"" movies.

""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" (1965) and ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"" (1966) are spoofs of the early James Bond flicks and, to a lesser degree, the early 60's beach movies with Avalon & Funicello (mainly because Frankie stars in the first one and it shares the harmless, fun-spirited flare of the beach flicks). They're innocuous mid-60's slapstick comedies in the style of ""I Dream of Jeanie"", but extended to a full movie. Their main attraction can be found in their titles -- the 60's bikini-clad babes and Vincent price in the title role. Since I love both (and ""I Dream of Jeanie"") I figured I'd like these movies way more than I did, but I found them pretty forgettable, not to mention lame. Yes, I know, they're supposed to be lame, but there's good lame and bad lame and the two Dr. Goldfoot movies are mediocre lame, verging on bad.

The first movie takes place in San Francisco and the second one in Rome. These locations are highlights in addition to those already mentioned. These movies are also enjoyable as period-pieces as it's interesting to see the mid-60's styles, etc.

As far as the women go, I was a little disappointed with the first one in this respect; the second one is much better, not to mention it was directed by Mario Bava (which many insist is his worst film, lol).

At the end of the day, the Dr. Goldfoot movies are throwaway flicks, but they're worth catching for the highlights noted above, if you're in the right frame of mind.

The first movie runs 88 minutes and the second one 82 minutes.

6281419,3,B00IKVSE0Y,"I liked Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, even though I think it could have been better. The Bikini Bombs, however, was almost incomprehensible despite an effort at the very beginning to explain what was going on. The two Italian comedians in this film do nothing to add to the movie. Also, the plot itself never seems to gel. I'm glad I saw it, as I appreciate Vincent Price's work, but this movie doesn't do his talent credit.",1379030400,,431,4.538461538461538

6281422,3,B00IKVSE0Y,"Vincent Price can deliver the most incredibly stupid lines and make them sound right.  Unfortunately, for all practical purposes, Price is all these movie have going for them and even he couldn't bring them up to better than marginal acceptability.  On the other hand, they have to judged by when they were made.  Today, even with Price in them, they wouldn't deserve a single star.  With the exception of Price the acting was poor, the plotting worse, the editing sad, and the special effects a joke.  On the up side, they were hardly intended to be taken seriously.  As a satire on the secret agent movies being made at the time, pointing out the more subtle idiocies of those movies, and taking shots at beach party movies and other such nonsense at the same time, they do have some redeeming qualities.  The poor production qualities and acting were far from unusual at the time these were being made, and others no better then these are considered decent movies for the era.  While not great or even good movies, I found them moderately entertaining.  Once.  I'd recommend renting, or better yet borrowing, not buying them.  I suspect a few beers while watching might help as well.  If you're one of those people who would be happy listening to Vincent Price read a telephone book, which I can understand, go for it, and you might even want to own them.",1374019200,,1358,4.659663865546219

""The Bikini Machine"" has the wonderfully doltish Mike Mullaney playing Dr. Goldfoot's revived-from-the-dead assistant while ""The Girl Bombs"" has the luscious Laura Antonelli.  The latter film is almost negated by the terrible Italian comic duo of Franco and Ceccio who remind you of Jerry Lewis and Roberto Benigni on a bad day but such is the lovely Laura's charms no harm no foul.

Over all it is an AIP mixed bag of Price and the beach movies spoofing the spy craze of the sixties,does it all work absolutely not. But it has some very amusing moments and at least a few good laughs.
The second movie is Dr. Goldfoot and Girl Bombs this is a very rare to find film and this is the only release I have ever seen in the USA. Again it stars Price and Fabian( had a following in the 60s). What makes this a treat to have is the fact that the great director Mario Bava directed it!  As a comedy it is very flat the two Italian comics in it may have been huge in Italy in the sixties but are just lame here. It was rushed and it shows.

The second (Bomb) is supposed to be a comedy spy movie but tends to fall flat.  It tries to steal from some other period comedies.  I didn't hate it like some others but agree it's weaker than the original.
