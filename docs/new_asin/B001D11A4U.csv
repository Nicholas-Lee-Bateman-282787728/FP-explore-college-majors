8290824,3,B001D11A4U,"This is a cheesy movie about 2 drug dealers named Lazy (Deadlee) and Shorty (Ernie Islas). They are involved in deals with a gay guy named Mike(Peter Tahoe). Guera (Monique La Barr) is Lazy's girlfriend, although lazy has a few girlfriends. Guera attempts to win Lazy by visiting a seer, which I found to be the campiest scene in the film. The acting and dialouge are simply bad and trite in an attempt to be funny. The film had potential but doesn't deliver the cheese it needed to be successful.

F-bomb, sex, side breast nudity, cat fight.",1338076800,,542,4.587628865979381
8290825,3,B001D11A4U,It's says it is a comedy but it is not that funny. But it is well shot i got to give it that and i like the guy that played lazy he is cool. But it could had been like 20 minuets shorter. But i got it from the 5 dollar bin at Walmart so i can not complain.,1305158400,,256,3.3559322033898304
8290826,3,B001D11A4U,"""Hoochie Mama Drama"" starts off as exactly what the cover art promises: an off the chain, over the top hood comedy throwback with a Los Angeles Mexican spin.  The characters are definitely not PC and stereotypes, yet the performers are skillful enough to make them believable and interesting.  Production values are top notch, and the plot line veers away from the predictable once things get going and keep you guessing.  Choices made by the writer at the end of the film are surprising and interesting.  Rapper Deadlee 2213, in his first lead role, acquits himself well as a drug dealing Lothario juggling women and navigating drug deals, all the while not imbibing anything stronger than some shotglasses of liquor in one scene.  All in all, a lightweight and fun romp that doesn't waste your time.",1242432000,,801,4.9037037037037035
8290827,3,B001D11A4U,"This movie is pretty funny at times and seeing Deadlee out of his element, sort of, was nice to watch. I am a hugh Deadlee fanatic and I would never guess he was gay if I didn't know about him and his persona.  He is very believable and given a little better script and actors to work with would really show off the talent that lies within him. The movie held it's own but some of the acting was over done. And the ending was surprising but cheesy. But, overall an interesting movie.",1227657600,2,483,4.193548387096774
