1666512,3,B00005UQAF,"Himura Kenshin's Hiten Mitsurugi sword style has allowed him to defeat numerous, powerful opponents, making it the most powerful sword style possible. It relies on reading the opponent -- be it emotionally, physically or strategically -- and drawing the sword at a godlike-speed, battou-jutsu, which results in his name as the ""Battousai."" This series deals with Amakusa Shougo, who has also mastered the Hiten Mitsurugi style, but not its philosophies. Kenshin must confront him in order to keep the proud name of the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu.
It is extremely tough to follow up the second season of the Rurouni Kenshin series that had him battling impossibly and uniquely strong enemies using the Hiten Mitsurugi's final technique or ougi. He has already used it three times in the previous season, and will have to do so numerous unexciting times in the season to come. How exciting is it to watch the ultimate swordsman perform the ultimate move from the ultimate swordstyle? Shouldn't the opponent ALWAYS lose then? There is little continuance and connection to subsequent episodes, which end abruptly at episode 95. The new OAV set, Seisou Hen, provides the needed closure, but lacks in the powerful swordfighting seen in the first and second season. Diehard fans will want to continue watching just for the sake of watching...why not? But ultimately, this third season will go nowhere and has few plot connections to the previous two seasons. Not essential, but thirst-quenching enough for diehard fans...avoid if you are looking for a repeat of the Kyoto series.",1018224000,3,1565,5.141176470588236
1666513,3,B00005UQAF,"Rurouni Kenshin, a series which in my opinion is the best anime, even though I've only recently gotten into it, I still have all the dvds available at this time, and I do intend on buying the rest, this ""Tales of the Meiji"" arc will probably not be as good as kyoto, but I'm sure most of you already have heard that they have released two new OAV's in japan which will finish off the kenshin series, and also put in the final arc in the manga which features Enishi, I don't know if it will come to the US....but I certainly hope so, if not, I'm gonna have to buy a region 2 dvd player, HA.

1666514,4,B00005UQAF,"This DVD presumably begins the Shimabara arc of Kenshin. It isn't nearly as good as the Kyoto arc (vol. 7 - 14 of the DVDs) which it follows. This isn't to say it's _bad_, however. It was made for TV, and so suffers by comparison with the episodes which came from the manga. It's still far better, in my opinion, than some of filler from the end of the 1st season (vol. 4-6 of the DVDs). Sano, in particular, is fleshed out in some more detail. It would have been better if the producers had waited for the manga so they could have animated the real ending. If you want to see the best of Kenshin, then check out the Kyoto arc. If you already have, and want to see more of Kenshin, Kaoru, Sano, and Misao-chan, you might consider getting this disc.",1009584000,14,748,4.2377622377622375
1666515,5,B00005UQAF,"All DVDs have been excellent up to now. From the manga, I can say it's going to continue to ba as good as ever.
Definitely one of the best mangas ever (if not the best).
The worst is to wait for the next releases...",1009497600,2,215,3.909090909090909
1666516,1,B00005UQAF,"Rurouni Kenshin: Shimabara Arc.  The beginning of the worst Kenshin arc ever.  Its not based on the manga, and its terrible. For some reason they decided not to make the Jinchu arc which is just AWESOME and create this one themselves.  Its about a man who beleives he is the son of god etc etc, he also knows hiten mitsurugi ryu, has many followers, etc etc, stuff happens, horrible fighting, boring story.  The only way you should watch this arc is by downloading it.  It is NOT worth the money to buy it or even rent it, if you can manage doing that.  Please do not waste your money.",1008720000,9,585,4.321100917431193

7955135,5,B00005UQAF,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

A man is assassinating government leaders around Kyoto. He apparently uses the same style as Kenshin. Supposedly Master Hiko and Kenshin are the only ones who use Mitsurugi style, but that's not the case. Kenshin feels it's his responsibility to take care of it. A new enemy appears with a style that surpasses Mitsurugi.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353196800,,1465,4.8326693227091635
7955136,3,B00005UQAF,"I gave the DVD +2 stars because four years after watching these episodes for the first time (and utterly despising them) I look back at all the good times they brought.

All those hillarious watercooler chats about how god-awful (no pun intended) those Kenshin vs. Super Jesus episodes were.

For some reason, anime fans have always been curious about religious themes.  I suspect that the writers were inspired by the popularity of animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion and figured Super Jesus would be a perfect villain for Kenshin.  Think of all the merchandise sales!  What kid wouldn't want a Super Jesus action figure?  Super Jesus posters, Super Jesus t-shirts, Super Jesus lunchboxes!  Who better to challenge Kenshin as master of the Hiten Mitsirugi style then Super Jesus?

Thankfully, the attempt to jump on the bible-bandwagon failed, and the series never took off.  Regardless, I'm going to say sometime that I would never had said before: watch these episodes (borrow them from a friend, preferably).  While they aren't at all entertaining themselves, they do lead to some entertaining conversations.",1110067200,,1112,5.196629213483146
7955137,5,B00005UQAF,"Watsuki may not have written the material for this arc, but that doesn't stop it from being good.
In this arc, Kenshin confronts a new opponent who somehow knows the Hiten Mitsurugi style and is using it to kill. After a dangerous situtation involving Misao and later on Chou (no further spoilers given here) its back to Kyoto, only to risk a battle thats been hundreds of year in the making.
A new cast of characters are introduced, as well as a deeply interesting storyline. Personalities of the main cast are kept intact and in character.

I think this arc is very in line with Watsuki's style, both in character development and in plot quality found in the previous RK series.

There aren't that many decent fillers out there, so don't pass up this arc.",1077408000,,757,4.6
7955138,4,B00005UQAF,"After a few comic relief episodes the first major story arc for Season Three of ""Rurouni Kenshin: Tales of the Meiji"" emerges on Volume 16, ""Son of God,"" which offers up episodes 67-70 of the celebrated Japanese anime.  Episode 67: ""Gleaming Blade of Legends! The Mystic Swordsman Shougo Amakusa"" introduces the prophecy written 200 years earlier by a mysterious missionary who sailed to Japan that said ""When the river of Christian blood stops"" (i.e., the end of the persecution of Christians in Japan) it will be time for vengeance.  Specifically, ""When the day dies and turn into darkness, the child of God shall appear.""  Shougo Amakusa believes himself to be a god and his destiny to claim that vengeance for the dead by commanding an army of the faithful and fighting with the Hiten Mitsurugi style.
The other three episodes in this collection are: Episode 68: ""The Medallion of Destiny: The First Meeting of Sanosuke and Sayo,"" has Sanosuke becoming embroiled in the religious conflict.  Episode 69: ""To the Battlefield of Shimabara: The Moment of Decisive Battle"" begins the battle between Kenshin and Shougo, the rogue Hiten Mitsurugi master, which concludes with a rather shocking turn of events in Episode 70: ""Shock of the Rai Ryu Sen!: Kenshin Sent Into Darkness.""  The Christian Saga concludes with the next four episodes collected on Volume 17, ""Rurouni Kenshin: Holy War.""
After the epic Kyoto story arc it would be a mistake to try something similarly overblown and that is not what we have here.  This story line is more grounded in the history of the Meiji period with regards to the treatment of Christians, and it is certainly interesting to get the Japanese perspective on the issue.  I would not qualify this as great, mainly because I think it will take time and distance to reach the peaks of the Kyoto story line again, but it is still very good.  Meanwhile, in terms of the DVD extras the history lessons continue with the Linear Notes, where we learn about the Kakure-Krishitan (""hidden"" Christians), their leader Shirou Amakusa, and the Shimabar-no-Ran riot.  Also, there is a new song about ""my heart"" for the new end credits, and already I am missing the rain washing away my alibi song.",1073606400,5,2218,4.8933333333333335
7955139,5,B00005UQAF,"I actually loved the Son of God storyline, and preferred it to the Kyoto/Shishio storyline. While it's not quite as heavy on action, it's much heavier on plot. This part of the series was also very emotional. For people watching the series just for the fighting, you can probably skip this part of the series, but for those who like the plot, the characters, and the emotions they produce, this is the best story arc in Kenshin.",1069891200,4,428,4.571428571428571
7955140,5,B00005UQAF,"I loved it. Don;t listen to what others say. This is one of the best tapes to own. I loved the last eposied and you can see some of the romance of kenshin and karou. please you have to see it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. the fighting was good. I always wanted to see more of the hitten style that kenshin uses and you see it this tape. some say this tape was not good, but i loved it. if you didn't like it then you don;t know what kenshin stand for and why he will always fight to protect people.",1069113600,5,514,3.7685185185185186
7955141,2,B00005UQAF,"This is a ok story.  If you are a Kenshin junkie, you probably just get this to quench your thirst for more Kenshin.  But a note of caution from me is that this was never written by Watsuki himself.  These were filler episodes written by Sony to fill in the anime while the poor manga artist was contemplating what to write about for the third arc.  INHM, this story lacks the continuation from the main Kenshin story and the style has changed for the worse.  The previous arcs is comparable to those written by the famous Hongkong writer of swordsman novels, Jing Yong, but after the Second Arc this style just died off.  Needless to say, it's because it's no longer Watsuki's story.",1039305600,,684,4.520325203252033
7955142,5,B00005UQAF,"...This was an absolutely amazing DVD!  I would definately recommend it to any kenshin fan, and actually anyone who likes this type of show.  The intruduction of Amakusa Shougo was an absolutely brilliant move for Watsuki.  This is an excellent story well worth watching and parallels the greatness of the entire kyoto arc.
This is a must buy",1020384000,,342,4.862068965517241
7955143,5,B00005UQAF,"The visual effects in this DVD as well as the plot make it a very good beginning of the ""Tales from the Meiji""... (considering that the previous DVD, ""Fireflies wish"" was not that cool).  Kenshin has a new mission, defeat another student from the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu (the Son of God) that should not have ever learned the ""God like Speed"" Style.  Sanosuke falls in love and is seen in a fighting sequence doing much more that just taking a beating.  You laugh, you smile, you enjoy the plot as Kenshin takes a piece of Japan's history once again.  In the last episode of this DVD kenshin is attacked by the Son of God with a combination known as Rai Ryu Sen and recieves an unpleasant surprise.  You will see that this DVD is packed with a lot of detailed and interesting history.  Leaves you wanting to see the Holy War DVD which I will RUN to buy ASAP!!!!",1020124800,,857,4.3584905660377355
