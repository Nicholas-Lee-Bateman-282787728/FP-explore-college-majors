6639392,5,B00NCD0N9U,"This was very well made documentary. I always find the first hand testimony of survivors to be the most interesting, and I also agree whole heartedly with them in the fact that these stories of the horrors of the holocaust need to be shared forever, so that this part of history never repeats itself.",1481155200,,300,4.574074074074074

6639405,3,B00NCD0N9U,I didn't realize it was an interview video but enjoyed it just the same.  It was very moving and an emotional first hand account.,1475452800,,129,4.375
6639406,5,B00NCD0N9U,"What can one say? Horrible memories, personally experienced by those whose only crime was being jewish? People who witnessed horrible
things that no one should ever see. It should always serve as a reminder to never forget what happened.",1475366400,2,237,5.102564102564102

6639409,5,B00NCD0N9U,Very important part of our history....well made and heart touching.,1475020800,2,67,5.8
6639410,5,B00NCD0N9U,"There is no substitute for firsthand views of an event so important in world history. Some of the speakers have fairly heavy accents, and it's easy to miss some of the things they say. Watch the film twice.....that helps to catch what you didn't quite understand the first time.

6639413,5,B00NCD0N9U,The Interviews with survivors was candid and straightforward. Explanations of what they experienced - The remembrances of the Everyday German people and their indifference to the suffering of the Jewish people was what struck me the most. Their hatred sent shivers though me.  They went out of their way to tattle on Jewish people knowing full well that could/ probably would result in the Jewish persons' death. How does a person get to the point of thinking that way? They were murderers even though they didn't shoot the pistols.,1472860800,5,532,4.977528089887641

6639415,5,B00NCD0N9U,"How do you write a review on Voices of the Holocaust? What Hitler and his minions did to the Jewish people during WW2 was beyond any words that can be said, his hate for a race of people is hard to understand and can only be described as evil. Seeing these that survived such horrible times and treatment, seeing that these events are clear in their minds just as if they happened yesterday. May all people see what hate does and never forget the evil that was done to the Jews, if we forget, how quickly will it happen again, or maybe if we look closely enough we will find that it is happening, just not to the extent that it did in WW2.",1472428800,10,639,4.161290322580645

6639417,4,B00NCD0N9U,A bit low budget but I loved hearing the first hand accounts from survivors in a timeline-like format.  Easy to follow.  Subtitles would have been nice for a few with thicker accents.,1471564800,2,183,4.6875
6639418,5,B00NCD0N9U,Breaks your heart to hear the stories. True evil and horror not that long ago.  Never forget or we will repeat.,1471478400,,111,4.285714285714286
6639419,5,B00NCD0N9U,It's a heart wrenching combination of stories of loss and survival. The things that these survivors went through and have made a life for themselves afterwards is remarkable.,1471046400,2,174,5.25

6639423,4,B00NCD0N9U,The voices of the dark past. Realizing that these people were able to recall this time was sobering. I hope we can put a stop to such autrosoties from continuing.,1470009600,,162,4.433333333333334

8677400,5,B00NCD0N9U,"The precious people who were interviewed in this documentary are real, live survivors of the hell that was the death camps of WWII. Their pain after half a century was palpable as they spoke of the unspeakable things done to them and their families. I found myself desperately wanting to reach into the tv screen and hug them. This is an important documentary that all should see.",1529884800,,380,4.686567164179104

8677404,4,B00NCD0N9U,I wish more people could hear these people's stories. It is so sad that we are losing this generation that experienced this without hearing all of their stories. It is somewhat hard to understand but it adds to the real nature of the film. I wish I could just sit and talk to these people.
