8242549,5,B0011V7PTG,"This installment within a wonderful series is particularly memorable.  It focuses on four works: Botticellis La Primavera, Uccellos The Battle of San Romano, Leonardos The Last Supper and Piero Della Francescas The Resurrection.  Each work is hauntingly beautiful and each involves technical issues which are discussed and explained.  The Botticelli is well-known, particularly in the cutouts of the face of Flora.  The picture also involves rape, negligee-clad Graces and a possible homage to a patron who lacks the good looks of Mercury.  What is Mercury looking at?  Camille Paglia offers a cogent suggestion.

The Battle of San Romano is less well-known, in part perhaps because it consists of three panels, now displayed in three different countries.  Uccellos technical brilliance is explored at length and a number of anecdotes are offered, e.g., Lorenzo the Magnificent sending a team of thugs (led by, yes, Big Frank) to steal the work.

The Last Suppers problems of deterioration are explained and the bungled restorations are recounted.  At various points we see details of the work flush with the color that Leonardo originally utilized.  The images are utterly dazzling; what remains is little more than a ghost of a great art work.

The Resurrection is, in many ways, the most telling of the works.  Aldous Huxley claimed it was the greatest picture in the world and a British artillery officer held back his units fire when he recalled Huxleys comment, thus protecting and preserving the painting.  In contrast to The Last Supper, this is a fresco whose colors remain bright and whose details remain clear.  Probably the greatest resurrection painting of all time, the eyes of the risen Christ are alone sufficient to draw in the viewer and never let him or her go.

The entire series is highly recommended.  This is the kind of documentary which the BBC does brilliantly.",1512000000,,1887,5.11437908496732

8242552,5,B0011V7PTG,"I use this film to focus my Western Civ students on certain aspects of Renaissance culture. They are invariably enchanted, and learn a great deal. The Primavera, with its Pagan imagery and attention to detail, is well analyzed, along with the political and cultural realities of the time, but the real showstopper is DaVinci's Last Supper, a brilliant artistic experiment that failed (DaVinci didn't really know how to do fresco painting) but still moves us. The appalling tale of how a door appears at the bottom center of the painting always gets my students talking..

Highly recommended for art fans, history buffs and those who enjoy the intersection of the two.",1401408000,3,667,5.009009009009009
