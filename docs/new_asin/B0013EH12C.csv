8250443,5,B0013EH12C,"A glimpse into the despair of the average Germans before and after Hitler's takeover of their country.  It is an in-depth and searing depiction of the Nazi horrors.  Sam Waterson does a splendid job of portraying William L. Shirer, a newsman present at much of the pre-WWII days in Europe. Shirer's wife and he eventually fled the Reich shortly before America became embroiled in WWII, after which he wrote The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the basis for this film.  Very well done.  Well portrayed by the assembly of actors.",1222819200,2,529,4.717391304347826
