8227061,1,B000X76ZGI,a dead set shocker!... maybe it was a tax dodge for the producers?... weak fight scenes poorly filmed and with dreadful wire work...not worth one star... not a single redeeming feature... zhou commits seppuku with this one... hung my copy outside bedroom window to scare off lice-ridden pigeons...,1372896000,,297,5.208333333333333
8227062,5,B000X76ZGI,"Is this movie in Cantonese with an option to English dub? Or is it just in English without Cantonese. I am looking for the Cantonese version with subtitles.

Thank you!",1241568000,2,168,4.6
8227063,3,B000X76ZGI,"My interest was to see Clubfoot as a main character, and he really is in this movie.

Zhao Wen-Zhou instead of Jet Li, and he moves fine! Maybe the main factor that makes this movie in an inferior rate to the first 3 is the lack of Tsui Hark as director.

the movie is good enough, good fight sequences and good chemistry between the cast!",1224806400,2,339,4.2
