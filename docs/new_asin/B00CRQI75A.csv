5735568,5,B00CRQI75A,This is probably my favorite of all of Stephan Kesting's instructional DVDs.  Brandon Mullins was such an excellent teacher in this series that I flew him to my own BJJ Academy for a weekend seminar!  Highly recommended for all students of the game.,1403654400,4,249,4.767441860465116
5735569,5,B00CRQI75A,"There's nobody on the internet who provides better value than Stephan Kesting...and this is no exception! If you're a serious student of BJJ, I would highly recommend you check it out.",1403654400,2,184,4.967741935483871
5735570,5,B00CRQI75A,"This series was especially well done - even for Kesting.  The advantage of Stephan's work is that he is able to boil it down to it's simplest elements so that the moves are useful from all levels: white to black.  Combine that with Mullins' very decorated competition resume and you have a winner.  These are moves that are more for little guys, but big guys can use them too - even if to know what the little guy is going to do.  The series is more about using skills to avoid pressure rather than to inflict it.  Very well done though.

It's really well done in layout, technique progressions, and effectiveness of the material. Easy to learn and without a doubt has elevated my game tremendously by helping me fight smarter! Worth it's weight in gold!!

5735572,4,B00CRQI75A,"Not all the techniques Brandon shows in this DVD works for me.  As it is very hard for me to get a triangle on a bigger opponent.  But there are many techniques in this DVDs that have changed my game.  I can sweep people who are much taller and bigger than me ""easier"", allowing me to actually achieve a better position.  The game changer DVD I find it to be extremely valuable , as well as the escape plan DVD.  As I train more and learn new techniques and drills from my instructor, there are more moves in this DVDs that make more sense to me.  If you are a smaller person struggling against bigger and stronger opponents at your gym I definitely recommend this DVD.",1428537600,4,669,4.26984126984127

5735578,5,B00CRQI75A,These DVDs should be part of any pratictioner's collection who is serious about learning BJJ fundamentals.  Brandon and Stephan took the time to go over the moves step by step giving as much detail as possible.  Excellent work.,1414886400,2,227,4.947368421052632
5735579,5,B00CRQI75A,"This set was just excellent. The instruction is just superior to anything I've seen before. The techniques are all so easy to integrate and have rapidly advanced the complexity of my approach to grappling.

I have bought a few of Stephen's DVD's and have never been disappointed, but I have to admit this one stands out especially. Stephen and Wolverine Mullins have a special kind of charisma, and they always seem to address the key problems that even I experience as a larger grappler.

Fantastic set.. 10/10",1408320000,5,511,4.862068965517241

8585357,5,B00CRQI75A,This is the second set of DVD that I bought featuring Mullins and Kesting.  They are both great instructional videos.  I highly recommend this set as they are almost a complete game plan that you can use or parts to fill in gaps in your own game plan.  I especially love the stand up game plan. You can see Brandon taking down Blackbelt Judokas with his techniques.  Highly recommended!,1464825600,,386,4.550724637681159
8585358,5,B00CRQI75A,"Great Series. I am a BJJ white belt, though I trained in MMA for 2 years prior so I am familiar and comfortable with different positions and basic submissions. What I was missing most was a gameplan, and knowledge of the steps between the basic positions and finishing the submissions. Although this series doesn't teach every possibility (obviously), it does provide go-to ideas and gameplans for every position, with step by step details on setup.

I was frustrated by youtube videos showing me great submission ideas that I wasn't able to set up on a live partner, and I often wasn't sure why I could get into the positions on some opponents and not others. Brandon and Stephan work through setups very well, and show a number of options from major positions that help to counter the opponent's movements. I haven't looked at the no-gi or escapes DVDs yet so I can't comment here, but the top game & takedowns, bottom & guard game, and game changers DVDs are all great, and are worth the money by themselves. Some of the material is very specific, and would be better suited for higher belts, but the vast majority of it is great for me as a mid-level white belt. The guard section was especially useful for me, as I am a ""big guy,"" with a top position game. From guard I have snagged a couple of triangles and pendulum/flower sweeps since this DVD set.

I have had this set for almost a month. I only have Roy Dean videos to compare it to; both a phenomenal, though Roy's belt requirements are more providing options from each position, while this provides less options but more gameplans. I am glad I have both!

Personal Tip: I started a word document with detailed-ish instructions on techniques that I want to master, and I leave references to the source material (ex Bigger stronger set, top gameplan..) in case I want to review it. I recommend this to any beginners who are hoping to speed up the process of info/technique gathering as writing it out helps to actively work through the details, and this provides me with a central reference that I can refer to for things I need to work on/drill/keep in mind. With info packed sources like this one (I also like Roy Dean's videos), a quick reference is great just before a BJJ class so I can make my day's goals and techniques to ensure I am moving forward.",1459641600,2,2317,4.564903846153846
8585359,5,B00CRQI75A,Brandon and Kesting have been collaborating for a while and they really hit their stride with this set.  From beginner to advanced you will find super useful moves and insights.  You should think  of this as a library rather than one set.  Each cd is packed and requires careful review. You are sure to find game changers on each one.,1455926400,,334,4.516666666666667
