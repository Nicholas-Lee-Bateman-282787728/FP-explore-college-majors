8194050,4,B00007G1YZ,"I give this DVD four stars but not because of the Black Sabbath stuff, you must rather check the classic rock performances within. That part is the one that worths your money.
Back to the Sabbath, you will see what you've always seen Tony Iommi speaking about the making of songs like Paranoid and Black sabbath, footage of the songs included(does it sound familiar?).
Take care if you read Smoke on the Water in the case, is not that Black Sabbath performance you've always been searching for, nah, it's just Ian Gillan Band performing (there are much better performances than this one -Rainbow with Joe Lynn Turner at the ""Straight between the eyes tour"" is one example-).
Completing this ""Sabbath story"" part are two promotional videos of the Tony Martin era (both of them included in the Black Sabbath Story vol. II).
So if you're a completist go ahead, buy it, if in anyway, as it was my case you feel dissapointed you can go to the performances of old groups like Uriah Heep and, believe me, you shall feel less upset about what you expected for a Sabbath DVD and you'll see who were the ones that deserved the four stars.",1041206400,9,1128,4.589108910891089
