I don't want to spoil it but the scene with the tiger had me on the edge of my seat.",1509494400,,167,3.5405405405405403
8148105,4,B000IZJRHY,"It is one of the many Amitabh-Rekha starrers. Amitabh presents an excellent comedy and action as happy-go-lucky criminal Natwar. Dialogues between Natwar-Giridhari Lal, Natwar-Bhabhi Maa, Natwar-Shanno and above all Natwar-Lord Krishna statue/photo are particulary good. It has some good songs 'Pardesia' and 'Mere paas aao mere dosthon', the latter sung by Amitabh himself. Some other catchy ones are 'Thauba thauba' and 'Aere ye, oonchi oonchi bathon se'. Amjad Khan successfully does a more modern version his Ghabar Singh role. Satyen Kappu and Indrani Mukherjee are very good supporting casts. A truely watchable movie for the whole family.",1303084800,5,645,5.65979381443299
