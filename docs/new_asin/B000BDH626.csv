8085530,5,B000BDH626,"In his day, Douglas Fairbanks was ""the man"" of action films. Devilishly handsome with loads of bravado, he passed those traits on to his son, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. who emulated him during the onset of, ""the talkies.""  This is fun and a great example of how filmmakers and actors of those silent days legitimately captured the first film audiences.  They started all of the genres that we take for granted today. They were the pioneers and this is a good example of their success.",1378857600,,480,4.7023809523809526
8085531,2,B000BDH626,"I saw this film first by ordering from Netflix, then decided to buy. This edition is all black and white, although the film was originally one of the first technicolor films, something Fairbanks worked very hard to achieve. The music score on this DVD is terrible - they play Grieg's Holberg Suite, which is totally out of character and has nothing to do with what's happening on screen. The film itself is great, one of Fairbank's best, but spend a few more dollars and get the Kino Video version.",1186444800,4,498,4.606741573033708
8085532,3,B000BDH626,"Although this was one of the first films released in Technicolor, there is no color in this DVD release.  The transfer quality is average, at best, and there are not any DVD extras (I was hoping for something about the color version).

It's a good movie if you're interested in the silent era, and has some very good stunt scenes.  I did find some of the situations unrealistic, not unlike many ""hero"" movies of today.",1154476800,7,418,4.546666666666667
