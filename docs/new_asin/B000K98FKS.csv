8155140,5,B000K98FKS,"He is a good looking guy.  Not the greatest actor at that age and period of time.  He's gotten a lot more rugged and his acting has definitely improved. See new 2012 movie "" The Bullets are Missing "" with Lau Ching Wan.

This is his pretty ""cool"" boy period and pairing him with the ultra talkative and talents Dicky Cheung, make this a very enjoyable TV series.  However, you you read the original novels, a lot has been altered in this version.  Look it up on wikipedia.",1356048000,,472,4.318181818181818
8155141,4,B000K98FKS,"The story is so good! I love the characters, and the action sequences are quite cool. I mean, they're kinda exaggerated and dramatic, but they are enjoyable. Some parts of this series are very deep so be prepared when you watch this. The translated English subtitles are occasionally weird because you know, things get lost in translation, but I personally don't think it takes away from the story. When the dialogue is right, I find it to be pretty clever.",1311379200,,457,4.725
8155142,5,B000K98FKS,"I saw this series in Amazon and since I'm a fan of Asian dramas I gave it a shot and guess what? I like it, it has everything, comedy, drama and the martial art is awasome. and the English subs are really good,. it was worth my money. I also love the opening song, it sound great. Now I going to look for the lyrics.  Overall I like this series.",1200355200,4,345,3.9285714285714284
8155143,5,B000K98FKS,"A friend once told me that all the heros and heroines in the Chinese movies end up dying, but this is one movie that doesn't fit the bill.  The drama, the action, the humor, the romance, the costumes and the locations all make for a very intriguing and creative movie series.  The writer and the director are very clever in keeping you engaged in each of the characters and their individual stories that eventually weave and uncover the main plot of this drama series.  Good and bad, black and white, young and old, laughter and tears, humans and gods are a continuous yin and yang experience.  This is one Chinese movie purchase that's worth every penny.  C.

8155144,5,B000K98FKS,"This is a highly entertaining WUXIA series about two brothers separated at birth: Little Fish (the protagonist) was raised in a place called evil valley by a group of evil people who are really just misfits. His younger, and handsomer brother Flawless Flower, was raised by the women who killed his parents and has been raised to be the defender of the temple and to fight against the men who mistreat women (!).

As if this premise were not intriguing enough, this 8 disc series is very long and complicated! I agree with the other reviewer who said the villains are very well-done. None of them (Well, with the exception of Eunuch Liu) are entirely evil. I found myself really sympathizing with Biehe and his daughter even though they were bad. Flower is my favorite character... He is very hot... Especially in his white costume. I also like the relationship between the two brothers. While Little Fish grew up poor, he at least had a somewhat nurturing home life. Flower is taught very strictly by the masters of the Floral Palace.

Be warned, the first hour is perhaps my least favorite part of this series. Also, there is a lot of comedy, especially early on which takes a while to get used to... A touch more sophomoric than I like....If you persevere, however, you will discover this is a very addicting and well thought out series. Excellent!

5 stars.",1193702400,8,1361,4.686192468619247
8155145,5,B000K98FKS,This was a very entertaining series in many aspects. It captured the attention of everyone in the house of all age groups. Having only missed one or two episodes when it aired on AZN TV I still am looking forward to watching the entire series over again. I love the humor and the story line behind it all. It is a definite keeper.,1191110400,7,330,4.253968253968254
8155146,5,B000K98FKS,"this series is really good. good acting, good fight scenes, engaging, fast-paced plot, very WELL-DONE bad guys, great romance, this show has it.
The acting is good, particularly Little Fish/Dicky Cheung. He was alternately the funny guy, the dependable older brother, the loyal friend, the passionate lover and the brains behind the gang. cheung was able to switch very naturally between these attributes, giving his Little Fish a very complex, real personality that the audience can fall in love with and become very attached to as the series progressed.
Nicholas tse, well, OK, he is hot. With that great luscious hair and those flowing snow-white robes, he was just gorgeous in his role as Flawless Flower. For Nic fans, this series is worth watching just to sit and gape at the man. However, Flower does a lot of disappearing in this series. He just vanishes for a long time and pops up unexpectedly when he feels like it. That somewhat distanced me from his Flawless Flower. I just didn't care too much about him. But Nic tse too was good in this role. He can play the ruthless killer (the fight scenes in this show, with him, are just fantastic),dumb ""log"" and inexperienced child very well. But as the series goes on, situations called for a different kind of acting from him and he was able to perform that as well, very admirably and convincing too. <note that moment in the bridge when Little Fish called him ""useless"". His look of child-like hurt and vulnerability was awesome and tied in so well with Flawless Flower's character.
fan bing bing, other than bringing her very good looks to the screen, does little to really affect the story. she was fun at the beginning with Little fish but got boring in the end.

The beginning of this series will drag a little. but by being patient makes up for it as the series gets very exciting very quickly and is definitely worth it.
another good thing to be noted about this series is, the bad guys were VERY good as bad guys. They were not a bunch of morons, continually tricked by the good guys. They were smart, cunning, deliciously underhand, very sneaky and very powerful. However, as each bad guy has his evil reign and does the most evil he can, after a while, it is as if the directors are tired of them and they make a short appearance (after quite a long absence, be it lack of doing evil deeds or really disappearing) to be conveniently ""disposed"" off. that was really quite anti-climatic and sort of put me off.
another thing to be noted is, this show really has a lot of casualties. People die for other people and then, those other people end up dying as well. really depressing to tell you the truth. And of course a lot of wasted beauty and ""Dang! bad timing"". It got a little too excessive at the end, with the directors trying to milk out as much tears as they can from their audience. and if the audience knows that, it doesn't work too good.
Also, events were very well-linked and connected, each episode revealing a little more to that big picture. that is, only until around eps 20 something. After that, that big picture was done and everything sort of mellowed down a lot, with just 1 main event running the show. The rest of the time, seemed just to wait for the good guys' revenge. The series reached its climax too fast and lost steam at the end.
the humour of this show, at times, is an acquired taste. the chinese instrumental music in the series was good, and this does not just mean the 2 themesongs by Cheung and Nic Tse. the music during the show really helped the mood at times and was very well done.
One really should watch this series. If not for the other good parts of it, at least for Cheung. He was absolutely fantastic in this series. I felt so much for Little Fish, it was absurd. I was crying so much and I am the sort of person who roll my eyes at Leo and Kate and movies like the Notebook.
this is definitely a very good show. enough entertainment, action, tears and GOOD bad guys, what more do you want??",1181606400,14,4004,4.484931506849315
8155147,5,B000K98FKS,"I'm a Hong Kong cinema fan, but rarely have I found a series that entertains me as well as this series. The acting is great, the martial arts are good, the pace is fast (of course), and there are plenty of site gags, romance, drama, comedy, action. It's an involved and complex plot, but I enjoy it on many levels - with no sound, for instance, since the scenery is rich and beautiful and could stand as a character on its own, especially once you've watched with the sound and subtitiles. I enjoy the music, the colors, the witty dialog, the timelessness of the themes, the fresh and unique verbal encounters, the sense of wonder in many of the romantic exchanges. It's a series I feel comfortable and entertaining to watch with my mom, my kids, my friends, my spouse or all by myself. I'm not tired of it after 3 watchings (over time) of the 8 DVD's. What a treat!",1179014400,12,866,4.385093167701863
