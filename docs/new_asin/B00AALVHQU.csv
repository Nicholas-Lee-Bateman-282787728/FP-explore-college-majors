5406309,5,B00AALVHQU,"I really loved this movie and thought it quite a coup for Shlain to make the connection between the personal story (the father-daughter relationship) and the historical story of humanity's development to our modern-day inter-connectedness. Actually, it was pretty audacious of her to do that. There aren't that many directors out there who can keep our eyes riveted to the screen when talking about their father, (although there were, I felt, a few fleeting moments at the end of the movie that crossed the border into self-pity. But they were quickly over).

I was fascinated by Shlain's explanation of the right (female) and left side (male) of the brain and after watching the movie was amazed that Shlain had actually brought both sides together with the movie's images. She gave us the details and the historical categorizing, but at the same time she gave us the patterns that make up the Big Story. And she even threw in some humor. In short: this movie was a real delight to watch!",1360195200,4,989,4.817647058823529
5406310,5,B00AALVHQU,"As a fellow filmmaker, I celebrate Connected for its inventiveness, intelligence, and complexity. I've seen it more than once, and each time, I saw new things. Is it an essay on connectivity and technology? Yes. Is it a first-person story, a family love story? Yes. Does it make you think about things that really matter, in a way that never makes you feel you're being ""educated"" or talked down to? Yes. Does it require the viewer to make his or her own connections? Yes. Is it visually engaging? Very much so. Connected reminds me why I love visual storytelling and why it matters that people keep making -- and seeking out -- good, smart filmmaking. -Jennie Livingston (Paris is Burning)",1360022400,3,690,4.758333333333334
5406311,5,B00AALVHQU,"Connected is a film that makes you think. It ponders the largest questions in the universe and the most intimate questions of the heart. Tiffany Shlain simultaneously explores her lifelong relationship with her Dad who was her best friend, confidant , cheerleader, mentor and role model as he fights his battle with brain cancer and death and her most curious questions about the role of the internet in society today and in the future. She makes us think about the relationships between intimacy and connection, love and fear, utopia and the destiny of mankind. Big stuff, hard topics and tender moments. This documentary christened the 21st Century with a foreshadowing of what's next, what happened and why are we here. Loved it.",1359763200,4,732,5.008196721311475
5406312,5,B00AALVHQU,"Human responsibility is complex; priorities are often contradictory. In the Twentieth Century, postmodern writers and artists transformed mediums to allow for paradox, but it was not until the twenty-first-century film Connected: An Autoblogography About Love, Death, & Technology that audiences could collectively experience the visual, textual, and emotional beauty of holding complex inconsistencies while moving toward personal growth and global connection. Director Tiffany Shlain exposes the journey by which the global film she set out to make began to kick,  cry, and nurse itself into being something more authentic-- more connected--than any one viewer can articulate. Perhaps there's irony in merely writing a review of a film whose visually articulated thesis proposes the new century's possibilities are unleashed by the exponential increase in access to images. Shlain's hypothesis that a technologically interconnected world exercises each individual's image centers can be evidenced now--from the drifts of snow over which Shlain's father first released her from his view to the digitally mastered web of connections that refuse to release the globe from its collective potential, the images in Connected transform viewers into visionaries who don't have to eliminate the contradictions of their connectedness.",1359763200,4,1326,5.942408376963351
5406313,5,B00AALVHQU,"I intend to show the DVD when available to my Chavurah, which meets monthly & discusses topics of relevance & interest, typically having a foundation in something Jewish. After seeing the film I realized I had a topic that would energize all 18 of us.",1359676800,2,251,4.6
5406314,5,B00AALVHQU,"Thank you for creating such a great film that speaks of the struggles we have to balance our human and technology world. I was moved by the shared humanity and journey Tiffany and her family went on in dealing with a family member's bran cancer. I felt more connected to my community of honest and earnest people who want to use technology to learn and to grow, but also want to remain ""real"" with one another. Great food for though post-flm discussions with family and friends. Thank you!",1359590400,3,489,4.568181818181818
5406315,5,B00AALVHQU,"This wonderful film is fun to watch, full of striking images, humor, and the rich voices of Tiffany Shlain and Peter Coyote.  It raises the big issues of our time, looking back at history, and providing insights for reflection.  Shlain uses her personal story of the loss of her beloved father and her family's realization that they now were the `go to' actors who must make their own life and death decisions, as a metaphor for all of us to acknowledge our connections and responsibilities. Stimulating, never preachy.",1359590400,3,519,4.886363636363637
5406316,5,B00AALVHQU,A great collection of info coupled with a great story of love and family connection. I am grateful for the chance finding on PBS and glad to find it here~,1403568000,2,154,4.166666666666667
5406317,2,B00AALVHQU,"I was disappointed the only part i liked was the fisherman lying in the boat, but I wish the creator the best she turned a hard time in her life into a positive and that I respect.",1385424000,2,180,3.891891891891892
5406318,2,B00AALVHQU,"This film never seems to find a direction, barely touching on interesting topics such as honey bees and corn syrup, cellular phones and cancer, as well as pollution.  Even the director's own mess of a diagram makes no sense, so she relies on her father to connect ""the dots.""  Speaking of which, 50% of this film is an exploitation of a dying man, which should be meant for a family video, not a mainstream documentary.  Don't get me wrong, it's an understandable reaction to upcoming loss and grief, but it's the kind of footage that most would put into a vault after mourning because it ends feeling macabre.

Now this film builds a premises of the Left Brain analyzes logically, and that the Right Brain focuses on Art, Emotional Connections, and finding patterns.  Pattern Finding is not associated with the right brain any more than the left, which is why there are both intuitive-thinkers (NT's) and intuitive-feelers (NF's).  Intuitives focus on past and future, finding patterns from theory on down, where sensors are solidly in the present, aware of all five senses, and form opinions form the ground up.  It's clear that the director is a sensing-feeler, even advising to stay present and giving in to instant gratification.

What is not covered in this film is techno-stress, and the increasing desocialization of our youth.  Where once students would talk and pass notes in class, now they text and tweet, relying on technology instead of genuine interpersonal relationships.  The director encourages this trend as a good thing, because of dopamine released.  You get the same release pulling the lever on a slot machine, so does that mean diving into casinos is healthy, and creating a better world?

It's ironic that this film was created by a feminist, who concludes that we must declare our interdependence.  The parallel to the bees is never consistent, but a bee colony is a total dictatorship, not a collection of ideas.  Germany fell to such propaganda, which personally affected the director and her husband's own family.  Independence and connections are both a part of self-actualization, not opposites.",1381795200,10,2126,5.017094017094017
5406319,1,B00AALVHQU,"Tiffany Shlain talks about herself a lot to be so connected to everything.  Starting with a quote about interconnectedness by John Muir and sprinkling in far too little of the theories of her father Leonard Shlain she throws in vague connections from cellphones to radiation to her pregnancy without much thought.  I suggest reading her fathers books.  He was a doctor with very interesting ideas.  She invented the Webby Awards which picks best cat memes.  Tasked with such a big topic as ""Everything is connected"" she falls short of interesting let alone an overview.  Also try James Burke's BBC documentary series Connections 1,2 & 3 which must have inspired her fathers work and is far superior to this documentary.

5406320,5,B00AALVHQU,"It's a great documentary.  I watched it first time borrowing from local library and decided that it was so good that I'd like to buy a copy myself.  I also shared it with a friend of mine.  It's very insightful, full of interesting ideas, as well as well filmed and emotional.  It really makes me think what really matters in life.",1375228800,2,331,4.377049180327869

5406322,5,B00AALVHQU,I highly recommend everyone watch this. It's fascinating with its exploration of what connects us all...the internet and the emotional connections. It's a truly touching film with Tiffany's own personal life weaved into the making of this film. I LOVE this film. WATCH IT!  Tammy_who,1368835200,,283,5.288888888888889
5406323,5,B00AALVHQU,"How do you produce an ENGAGING film about ""Love, Death, and Technology""? Tiffany Shlain has found the way. This story of her life, her family, and her love of technology, interwoven with the personal challenges she was dealing with at the time, comes together in the most compelling and entertaining documentary that screams to be seen by the world. Her dramatic life, supported by data and scientific facts, makes this one of the most remarkable and memorable films I've ever seen. After downloading it and watching it, i immediately ordered a copy to send to my 84-year old father for his birthday. I know it will move him. This film should be seen by everyone.",1363046400,3,663,4.773913043478261
5406324,2,B00AALVHQU,"Still am unsure what the heck I just watched.  Was it a movie about her dad?  Brain hemispheres? Interconnectedness?  Human history?  Bees? Hard telling.  Some of the images were fun to watch but much of the narration/image matchup was disjointed.  Was pretty disappointed, kept waiting for a central thesis... seemed like I just watched the visual representation of someone's journal notes. And the pure optimism about technology didn't seem properly tempered with realism on how it can destroy human relationships...

p.s.  Found it really interesting that throughout the many, many montages of human history and historical figures, there wasn't a single image or person shown that represented Christianity.  Like it or not, Christian thought has had a huge impact on human history and throwing up a 2 second shot of Mother Teresa (and who doesn't love Mother Teresa???)  would've balanced things out some.",1362096000,6,908,5.286713286713287
5406325,5,B00AALVHQU,"When I sat down to watch Connected I did not anticipate the sublimely visceral ride I was about to embark on. Bravely vulnerable, insatiably curious, surprisingly informative. Tiffany Shlain's work is both whimsical and distinctive. The film effectively delivers a candid perspective on the state of our technology-crazed age.

Shlain addresses the many complexities we face in our day to day lives. She examines what it means to stay *connected,* and offers delightfully thought-provoking insights that uplift rather than condemn the viewer. The through line is the touching narrative of her father's struggle with brain cancer and the special bond that they share. At turns heartbreaking and uplifting, the movie is also jam packed with revelations and insights into our culture's obsession with gadgets.

Wonderful film. I recommend it highly.",1362096000,3,846,5.5
5406326,5,B00AALVHQU,"Just by reading the title, you can tell that Tiffany Shlain is going for an ambitious journey...and I've got to tell you,  WOW, what a ride. It's truly an emotional and intellectual roller coaster that makes you think, laugh and cry. sometimes all at once. This film isn't just about connectedness, it is in itself connectedness as it runs between the personal and the public, the little moments to the big arguments in a masterful and most of all, engaging manner, portraying our generation's main neurosis, thoughts and feelings toward technology and family. I recommend it for a family viewing and think it will be great for class discussions.",1362096000,,646,4.926605504587156
5406327,5,B00AALVHQU,"I recently saw Connected on my college campus this year and thought it was so amazing!  It really made me re-evaluate my own connection to technology and gave me a broad, historical perspective of communication from to the start of the planet (literally) to the present.  I loved the humor, animation, fun music and entertaining way the film brought to light important issues about the good, bad and possibility for technology today and the future.  We were lucky enough to have a fun Skyped-in post-screening discussion/Q&A with Tiffany Shlain, the filmmaker.  It was great to hear directly from her about her creative process for such an innovative documentary.  This was one of the best film experiences I've seen at school.  I went and bought the DVD to send to my mom as I think she'd enjoy it too!",1362009600,,803,4.782608695652174

Equal parts funny, insightful, and inspiring, the film traces the contours of what it means to be human in an age where texting, twitter, and time with those we value most all vie for our attention.

5406333,1,B00AALVHQU,"This is really about a great father and the people that loved him; especially his daughter who was very dependent on him.  Connectedness--The right brain/left brain mumbo jumbo and its application to explain human society is ridiculous--the hemispheres are connected.  Oh, but- we'll all be more egalitarian once we live in a female-right brain society. What about Michelle Bachman, You Betcha, and the Phyllis Schaffleys, et. al?",1361145600,2,430,5.402985074626866
5406334,5,B00AALVHQU,"Connected is essential viewing for anyone who participates in, thinks about, and perhaps has some concerns about how we as humans connect with each other in this digital age.  Tiffany Shlain is probably one of our most important filmmakers today - pushing the bounderies of communication and all of its implications.  This film is not only a consideration of how we relate to each other as human beings in the digital age - but as importantly - how those connections - and the way that we connect affect us both positively and at times negatively.  How are we transforming as a human race with our digital appendages?  How can we retain what is human about us?  How wonderful it is that we can connect with people across the planet in ways never dreamed of - but also what is the price of that digital connection.  As a parent - this is a must - and a must to watch with your children - and gift and share with your friends and family.
