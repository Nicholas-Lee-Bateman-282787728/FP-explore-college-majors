1741432,2,B00006AUK0,"There were too many cheerleading sessions guised as interviews with Rumsfeld and the other spectacle-eyed swagger sticks, but the overall video is decent, showing many aspects of the rebuilding efforts and documentation of the attack. Strategically, they did go into the Pentagon as a command structure and showed how it is basically a brain for the largest organization known to man (which is pretty cool). Some stuff about the original commision of the building, though not too much.
The real disappointment was too much focus on the ""mindset"" of everyone, instead of taking you on an actual tour of the place. National Geographic tells you about millions of square feet, but seen is almost nothing. They do go inside boardrooms not normally allowing cameras (ooohh, ahhhh) and some other crevaces like the parking lot security office (after a suspicious manilla envelope is sighted on the grounds).
What would have been INCREDIBLE, is if they had shown Pentagon Library, or any part of the virtual CITY that's underneath street level (there are reportedly more floors underneath than above). And I would like to have AT LEAST seen the inner courtyard. Or maybe a tour of the ""A-ring"", inner-sanctum of the top dogs. Something other than a memorial for September and the whining of top generals that they need more more more. A bit of a dissappointment.",1035072000,15,1355,5.026666666666666

7966803,4,B00006AUK0,"I was always fascinated with this place.  When my uncle and cousin worked there, I was able to visit and get a tour.  Truthfully, it would take weeks to fully tour that place and some areas I don't have clearance to even see.  Great video coverage.",1394496000,,248,4.3478260869565215
7966804,2,B00006AUK0,"While there're some good stories about the Pentagon (notably it's construction history and 9/11 rebuilds), there's very little about the actual building: layout, floors, common areas, cafeterias, etc. There's some shots of generic hallways, the BOCC, a couple meeting/war rooms, a glance at the courtyard, but that's about it. And you never really get a sense of how things relate to each other. They show a shot of a bank of elevators: where are they and what floor are the going to? Or here's this giant 5-way corridor intersection: what corridors are they and where are they?

Add to that the long segments where they start covering upcoming technology (which has NOTHING to do with the Pentagon, beyond the decisions about the tech will be made by those working there), and there's just not much worth watching here. Very disappointing, especially for a National Geographic product.",1383955200,,886,5.068493150684931
7966805,5,B00006AUK0,"`Inside The Pentagon' created in 2002 by N.G. after the Moslem Extremist attacks on September 11 2001 is a brief look at the history and straightforward contemporary observation in the strength of ordinary Americans doing extra ordinary things at the Pentagon. This documentary shows the historical facts in the strength of American Folks and American Leaders who work together as a Nation to destroy the enemy who seeks to destroy the United States. Listen to the voices of the people during this documentary and you as an American will be inspired and revitalized within the patriotic fabric of a great Nation.
  ... If you don't walk away after watching this documentary with a historic understanding, unlike the person who considered this DVD a waste, well then you're like the others who've watched and except too many Michael Moore lies, listen to the rants of conspiracy theorists, celebrate with blind academic American hating propagandists, and embraced the BS indoctrination from left wing talking head liberal idiots.",1305849600,2,1028,5.224242424242425
7966806,4,B00006AUK0,"Being in the military and conducting work for the Pentagon I just had to have this dvd.  It is very informative though of course you miss out still on a lot of things since they can't be released to the public.  Anyway, For an educational film it was pretty good though as mentioned don't expect to much detail in what is actually done there.",1216857600,,342,4.328125
7966807,4,B00006AUK0,"It had some interesting parts and ""gee whiz"" types of information, but for the most part it was repetitive and had a tendency to drag.",1168905600,,134,4.4
7966808,2,B00006AUK0,"This DVD is not nesecary for anyone to watch. 90% of the DVD revolves around 9/11, and only the remaining 10% is how the Pentagon, and the Armed Services work. Very little (10 minutes) is spent focusing on new technology that will be availible in the future.
Of the 90% talking about 9/11, 75% is propoganda for the ""war on terror."" If we want propoganda, we can turn on the television and watch it for free, not pay for a DVD or a DVD rental. The 15% reolving around 9/11 that is not propoganda, it talks about how the attacks effected the Pentagon, and how it all worked before, and after.
This is a waste of money, the only good part is the 10% talking about how the Pentagon & the Armed Services for in conjuction with each other. There is an interesting piece on the coast guard, however, that merely falls on the borderline between interesting information, and propoganda.",1087862400,15,878,4.49375
7966809,4,B00006AUK0,"I was planning to write a review on this for a couple of months, but the reviewer from Chicago really stole my thunder. Indeed, there is too much emphasis on 9/11, the proximity of the event being so close to the production time of this film. It gives some glimpse into the inner workings and the physical structure of the Pentagon, though as the previous reviewer pointed out classified areas underground are off limits, and the analysis is really lacking. Instead of analyzing the Pentagon in a broader political context, the film wraps it in the flag, but this was somewhat inevitable given the events of Sept. 11th. The Pentagon directly employs hundreds of thousands of people, only the Post office employs more -- almost a million workers now. And the Pentagon is responsible for indirectly employing millions of others as defense contractors and subcontractors. It is the nerve center of the military - industrial complex and a bastion of America's defense against enemies, whose number seemed to have increased since the end of the Cold War.
I am hopeful, however, that just as with the Cold War, the Pentagon will be instrumental in getting us successfully past our current hurdles.",1070323200,2,1191,4.930348258706467
