8633269,5,B00HLO56PC,"This video program explained the basics of an SLR camera in an easy to understand way. The tutorials are well put together, and really helped me step up to a higher level of photography with my camera.  It also had a ton of great information about marketing yourself that is helping me build up my clientele.  Probably the most valuable thing I gleaned from the video was how to get better pictures in low-lighting (without getting weird shadows from the flash) and how to get a nice white balance indoors or out.",1340064000,2,513,4.565217391304348
