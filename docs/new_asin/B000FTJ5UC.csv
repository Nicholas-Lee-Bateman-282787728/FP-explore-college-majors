2585747,5,B000FTJ5UC,The DVD looks to do everything other reviewers had said though will need to spend more time working through it to be sure. Surprised that postage charges included an additional 12.99 on top of the 6.34 already paid. The post office wouldn't release the package until I'd paid the extra charge.,1296864000,,293,4.764705882352941
2585748,4,B000FTJ5UC,"If one purchases a Tascam 2488 they will find the manual lacks a lot. David Wills who narrates the video brings to light the ins and outs of home recording on the 2488. I'm very computer ignorant, but was able to start recording the second day after watching the DVD. Highly recommended.",1288742400,6,287,4.538461538461538
2585749,5,B000FTJ5UC,"This is it!  If your looking for help or trying to make sense out of the 2488 manual, this is for you.  It is something I use over and over.  Covers most all questions I could come up with and quite a bit more.  Now the manual makes sense, since I have seen it done. This entertaining DVD covers all the areas of the manual as you are shown how to make a recording step by step with options in an entertaining format.  This should be standard equipment sold with the 2488.",1283644800,4,472,4.086956521739131
2585750,5,B000FTJ5UC,"User manuals are well and good, and Tascam provides excellent manuals with their products.  But with a tool as powerful and versatile as the 2488, having a video tutorial is almost a necessity.
While nearly impossible to go into depth within the confines of a single DVD, host David Wills does a superb job of introducing the 2488, 2488 MKII, and the 2488 NEO. Wills uses the 2488 for the tutorial, with pop-ups informing the viewer of any changes in the MKII and NEO versions, and there's a separate section going into the MKII and NEO in greater detail.
From the basics of recording in RECORDING SCHOOL, to the step-by-step process of recording, editing, mixing, mastering and burning your songs, the viewer is given a guided tour of basic theory, processes, and features of the 2488.
I purchased and watched this video a couple of times before purchasing my NEO, and it was an invaluable tool in getting up and running quickly.",1272067200,5,930,4.7407407407407405
2585751,5,B000FTJ5UC,"practically a must if no experience with digital work stations.
Greatly clearifies the working process.
Makes the manual much easier to follow & understand.",1266364800,2,156,5.541666666666667
2585752,5,B000FTJ5UC,"This DVD tutorial is excellent.  A must have for anyone purchasing the Tascam 2488 Neo. Building on the original Tascam 2488 DVD, it also includes updates for the 2488 MKII and the all new 2488 Neo.  The DVD is easy to navigate and gives you the ability to quickly get familiar with all functions of the 2488 and goes well beyond the standard manual (which is not exactly all that user friendly).  The host provides real-time, hands on instruction and clear how-to examples that will enhance your use of the 2488 and get you up-to-speed in no time at all.  Highly recommended!",1242086400,8,576,4.617647058823529
2585753,5,B000FTJ5UC,"Excellent video, covers almost all the features of the 2488. The host not only explains each function but shows the keystrokes and demonstrates how to record some guitar and vocals. If you are new to home recording there is even an introductory section titled ""Recording School"" which explains the basics of recording. I started recording on my 2488 immediately after watching this video. The visual demonstrations are like they say `Worth a thousand words'. I learned faster watching this video than I would have by reading the manual.",1180396800,13,536,5.1022727272727275
2585784,5,B000FTJ5UC,EXCELLENT INFOMATION  EASEY TO UNDERSTAND I HAD A 2488 FOR SOME TIME NOW BUT THIS DVD REALY HELPED WITH THE OPERATION TO GET BETTER RECODINGS  THANKS DAVID,1394409600,,155,4.703703703703703
2585785,5,B000FTJ5UC,It would had taken me three times if I only used the instructional booklet. The video takes you through each area of coverage in a watch/see format! Order this video with any Tascam 2488 purchase. Great Video...,1389830400,,211,4.72972972972973
2585786,5,B000FTJ5UC,I have this fancy home recording studio and had no idea how to use it.  This DVD gave me the advise I needed to get started.  Some good tips and I'd recommend it to any newbie wanting to get the most from your 2488.,1384992000,,215,3.8636363636363638
2585787,4,B000FTJ5UC,"This video is very complete and covers everything in the manual. If you are the kind of person who doesn't like to read, this is worth the money. I bought it hoping to learn more about how to sync to an external midi device. Unfortunately, this video covers only what 's in the manual. Nothing more.

So overall, if you can just read the manual, this provides no further information.",1383523200,,383,4.4714285714285715
2585788,5,B000FTJ5UC,"If you have this Digital Studio and keep putting off using it, this is the perfect thing for supplementing the manual and motivating you to use more of the bells and whistles that the manual doesn't explain the reason why or when to use. I have an associate degree in electronics and found the manual to be lacking in conveying the information in a format usable for the average user.",1381017600,,384,4.5
2585789,5,B000FTJ5UC,"As the owner of a Tascam 2488 neo, this tutorial is an absolute must. There is more power and ability in this one box than in a room full of racked, comparabily priced equipment although, being an ""all in one"", it does have it's limitations. Still, for the working/recording musician who needs a top notch stand alone digital recorder, this is the way to go.",1375401600,,358,4.523076923076923
2585790,4,B000FTJ5UC,Is a very good source of knowledge to use the tascam neo 2488. It you have never used a stand alone recorder or a studio experience this will be a must have to get a quality recording.,1366934400,,184,4.0
2585791,4,B000FTJ5UC,"Concise and well explained. Yes, you improve the knowledge of the recorder. Maybe could have more detailed tricks for the deep performance",1366934400,,138,5.318181818181818
2585792,5,B000FTJ5UC,"I own the Neo model of the three and the tutorial for the first two boards came with it.
There are only a few, yet substantial differences between the Neo and the 2488 and  MKII boards.
While the first tutorial was indespensible and even though this tutorial includes all of the same material plus the updated information, it was well worth the money spent on the second DVD.
  This tutorial give you the opportunity to walk through each process ""side by side"" with the host. In addition to simply learning how the board work on a step by step basis the tutorials actually teaches the fundamentals of recording to those who might just be getting into it.
Highly recommend this DVD.
 AND  for those who might have a board of a different manufacture you should visit the website as they produce similar tutorials for a variety of mixing boards form many other companys.",1366502400,2,867,4.640522875816994
2585793,5,B000FTJ5UC,"This really helped me to work with my Tascam 2488 Neo.  The manual for this unit is piss-poor and confusingly written.  Some of the keystrokes it says to perform don't achieve what it says they do, but this video helped to correct those.  I wish they would expand the NEO section a bit more because the unit can do so much, but at very least this video will get you up and running quite well.",1355356800,,392,4.2
2585814,3,B000FTJ5UC,I was dissapointed with this tuturial really thinking it was gonna be a big help and wasn't :( I would love to get my money back !!,1353283200,,131,3.888888888888889
2585815,4,B000FTJ5UC,"I bought the Tascam 2488 NEO and wasn't getting the information I needed from the manual. It doesn't explain certain aspects of the unit thoroughly. Although there is a lot to learn about the unit, This DVD covers enough information to get you on your way to understanding the unit and producing great quality recordings. If you need more than what the product manual offers, I would highly recommend buying this DVD.",1333843200,2,417,4.805555555555555
2585816,5,B000FTJ5UC,I ordered the Tascam 2488 Neo and found the manual to be very dry and boring. It was a real chore to read then try and do what the manual says...then I got this video and went from scratching my head in ignorance to recording and burning cd's like never before. Awesome host David Wills knows these machines in and out. I even talked to him on FB. Nice video David!,1333238400,3,365,4.154929577464789
2585817,4,B000FTJ5UC,"For the most part, I found this DVD really helpful as far understanding the workings of the Tascam 2488 Neo.  The guy who's on-screen is obviously very ""engineering literate"" and is a pleasure to watch.  He's pretty good about covering all the necessary points without making the instruction seem too dry.  My only complaint is that the DVD was produced for three different versions of the Tascam 2488, so some sections do not apply to the newer model and that gets a little confusing.  There are disclaimers at the bottom of the screen whenever something he's talking about no longer applies (if you have the newer version), but then you have to sort of blank that part of the instruction out and try to remember which things actually apply and which don't.  I would rather watch a DVD knowing that everything in it was applicable to the Tascam model that I own.  Other than that, it's a lot easier than reading the manual, and it allowed me to be able to work the unit without ever opening the book.  I'd recommend it.",1324944000,3,1020,4.571428571428571
2585818,5,B000FTJ5UC,This DVD makes sense of the poorly written manual that accompanies the Tascam 2488 in all of it's incarnations. Removes so many questions that I can't imagine using the Tascam with out watching this video. Have watched it 3 times and always pick up something new.,1323820800,3,263,4.739130434782608
2585819,3,B000FTJ5UC,"This tutorial cover many diferent types of Tascam product. I was looking for particular Neo, and this tutorial jump from from one to other. Is better then nathing, but not the way what I was expecting.",1323820800,,201,4.611111111111111
2585820,4,B000FTJ5UC,"The tutorial is very very good, It will get you started with the 2488 much faster than just reading the manual. It should encourage you to experiment with some of the ideas in the tutorial before setting up for an important recording session. The respect for the 2488 as high quality recording equipment is apparent in the enthusiasm expressed in the tutorial. The importance of understanding the signal path from mic to disk is properly stressed so that mapping your setup eventually becomes second nature.",1307664000,4,507,4.976470588235294
2585821,5,B000FTJ5UC,"This DVD Video Training Tutorial for Tascam 2488/MKII/Neo is excellent I would recomend it to any would be user of Tascam 2488 Neo. All the credits to David Wills he explains very clearly all the aspects of recording on this workstation. I'm so glad I've got this DVD,it makes use of the manual a lot easier as well.",1305763200,4,316,4.4655172413793105
2585822,5,B000FTJ5UC,"While the manual does provide what you need to get started, it really helps to be able to use this disc as a reference.  I was recording, editing, and mastering in one day!",1300752000,3,172,4.212121212121212
2585823,5,B000FTJ5UC,"This was very helpful to get started using the Tascam 2488Neo. It definitely helped to see firsthand how to perform basic operations. Many times there were cross references in the manual to other sections. Understandable given the flexability of the Neo, but it helped in cutting down the learning curve.",1297814400,4,304,5.1

8126519,1,B000FTJ5UC,"It started out good, reminiscing about the old days, and even a good encouragement of being a beginner, this is pretty good. THEN suddenly, AS IF a director/producer of this DVD, says ""Hurry the ___up!"" Then our brit ""educator"" went haywire, jumping fast from one button to the other, at times fading away or mumbling, and the video quality is not HD720 or not even 480, and again jumping from one thing or another with new words for a beginner. It is true, that a bad educator=a bad student. Most of the time our brit teacher is throwing words that any beginner won't understand, and either you pause it, look it up and go back to it. VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE. I wished someone wrote a book for dummies about this awesome porta studio.",1458604800,,741,4.578947368421052
