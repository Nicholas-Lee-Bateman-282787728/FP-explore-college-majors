8415728,5,B00443FMI4,"""Anything is Possible"" includes the work and thinking of a truly interdisciplinary artist who draws upon his own environment, personality, writers, musicians, current and historical events. All of these elements come to life through his doing and making to create a unique contribution to the visual and audio visual performance arts. Kentridge's work is challenging but also invigorating and highly recommended for art studio teaching.",1357862400,3,436,5.723076923076923
8415729,5,B00443FMI4,"Kentridge has to be one of the most engaging artists currently working, and this DVD does a wonderful job showing you a variety of his films, drawings, and projects.  Produced well, we get behind the scenes as we see him working with operas and opera singers which was a lot of fun to follow.  His work is smart, thoughtful, and he is a fine and whimsical craftsman.  This video does a fine and interesting job presenting him and his work.",1348358400,6,439,4.4625
8415730,5,B00443FMI4,"I don't own this dvd yet but I saw it in my art history honors class in college. Kentridge's work takes my breath away, but this video is so much more than just his beautiful shorts, but you get a to look at his method and style. Which is almost as amazing as his finished work. Then to top off this amazing dvd he talks about his inspiration and the social unrest of South Africa where he grew up. Get this dvd you will not be sorry!",1346112000,5,434,4.0

8415732,4,B00443FMI4,"Enjoyed hearing about the process of William Kentridge.  I loved that he seems to reflect deeply on his past.  He was at times a little hard to follow and understand I think because of accent.  Amazing artist.  I showed video to students they were not as moved as I was.  I think a few appreciated his work however, but I am pretty pleased that I reached a few.",1300579200,8,361,4.25
