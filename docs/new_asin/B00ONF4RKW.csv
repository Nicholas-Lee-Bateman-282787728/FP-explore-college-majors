The minuses:  l) The ""warmup"" is so fast paced, I felt like I needed to do a more reasonable warm up first.  2) The exercises are really intense, and although there is a modifier, it still didn't cut it for me.  3) After working out really hard on one side of the body, there are almost no breaks before starting on the second side.  I know that I will do sections of this DVD from time to time, but I doubt that I would choose to push myself to the point of doing the whole DVD at once.  I say this as someone who is a mid-to-advanced level intermediate daily exerciser, who knows how to further modify a routine to suit my body's needs. Please don't try this DVD if you are new to working out.",1485561600,,794,4.190789473684211

8684347,5,B00ONF4RKW,I love this workout DVD! I'm already seeing the changes in the body and I'm only 3 weeks in!!,1437350400,3,93,3.9473684210526314
8684348,5,B00ONF4RKW,"I really enjoy Tanja's workout videos, and Teri Ann is featured in several of my favorites, so I was excited to get this. This is a fantastic workout video. It's challenging for me, I'd say I was intermediate level, as in, pretty fit, but not one to lead a class. It's a fun workout, no matter which section, but Bendable Body alone is worth the price. Thanks T and TA!",1423440000,4,369,4.285714285714286
8684349,3,B00ONF4RKW,"The workouts on this dvd are great  I really like it but the reason I am giving it 3 stars is due to the lock of options, first there is not an option to play the entire 60 minutes of it at once so if you want to do the total 60 minutes every 10 minutes of each workout you have to have the control near by and go down the workouts to choose your next one and that was annoying to me because who wants to do that every 10 minutes.  I think this dvd could have been excellent had they put the option to customize your own workout or play the whole section without interruptions other than that the workouts are great and I did find it a little challenging, I would say that this dvd is for intermediates exercises and I really liked the flexibility workouts they included in this series.",1420588800,9,786,4.097402597402597
8684350,4,B00ONF4RKW,Definitely for those who want to go the next step into fitness.  Beginners be sure you watch the modifications.  You will get your workout!,1419292800,3,139,4.75
8684351,3,B00ONF4RKW,"About me: Certified Spinning Instructor for the past 10 years.  Runner (have run 7 marathons) and a cardio addict.  Love to sweat...hate to pump iron.

Pros: I am sore this morning.  Seeing that I needed to switch things up with less cardio & more weights I thought Christmas break while the kiddos are home would be a great time to start.  I used 15 lbs weights & it was a hard work out with that amount.  If you are a beginner I would use less weight.  Program is broken up into small 10 minute sections.  I did all of them.  Broke a sweat during the
""cardio party"".  Daughter (7 years old) did it with me too.  I didn't need a lot of space to do the video.  If you don't have weights you could still do the other sections of the video.  The BFF's are cute.  I would hang with them.  The sections seem to go quick and you do get a few mini breaks with in the sections.

Cons: The ultra fit chick needs to stop the drama.  She acted like the blondie was going to kill her with the work out.  The commentary from her is a bit much seeing that I am sure she was not on the verge of puking.  Would have been nice to show more shots of the modified gal in the back.  That was not done often enough.  Might be hard for newbies to follow.  Would have been nice to show more advanced options from the guy as if this is a new go-to video I will eventually need it.

Overall: the girls are cute and fun.  Tomorrow I won't have the volume on so no more drama from the ultra fit chick.  If I were to buy a work out video and wanted to ADD one to the mix, I would buy it again.  If this is going to be your only video in the collection, skip it and get another set in which you can do a variety of work outs.",1419292800,5,1697,3.9176470588235293
