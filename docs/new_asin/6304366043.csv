856355,4,6304366043,"Ryan's Daughter is a massive film, both in length and in scope. David Lean's films have that rare quality that most other films don't have: they are glorious but depressing. There are good performances by the whole cast, especially Sarah Miles and John Mills.",971740800,5,259,4.909090909090909
856356,4,6304366043,"No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and, of course,  ""Ryan's Daughter""(see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography in  all of Lean's films is always spectacular and breathtaking, for Lean had a  special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set  the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings. Lean characteristically  focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal  characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and  historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a  uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular  individual situation. Each of these films is also a well-choreographed and  photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the  geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are  always delighted by what Lean displays.
Here both the Irish seascape as  well as the bucolic countryside underpin this classic tale of how different  life circumstances trap and constrain individuals, and how much each of us  are affected by the greater social surround in which we interact. Robert  Mitchum is cast against type, and does a marvelous job as an aging bachelor  who has caught the fancy of a young and extraordinarily beautiful student  who wants him to fulfill her youthful fantasies about all those adult  characters he taught so ably about in class. Of course, the young woman,  played ably by a young and gorgeous Sarah Miles, is bound for  disappointment and a rude awakening. Things are not always as much like  these literary descriptions as she had hoped.
Into the picture comes an  attractive, dashing, and daring young English soldier, played by  Christopher Jones, who is immediately fatefully attracted to the young and  foolish woman, and eventually an affair begins. All of this is set in the  climate of both the Irish `troubles' and the threats associated with the  ongoing First World War in Europe, in which Ireland is anxiously  uninvolved.  As in all of the Lean movies, the ways in which each  character's nature, individual characteristics, and personal foibles  project themselves into the larger social circumstances provides the focus  of the unfolding story.  While the plot is nowhere near as memorable as in  some of Lean's other movies, the story is well told and is an interesting  and compelling look at small town life in an isolated and provincial Irish  village in the early years of the 20th century. I always enjoy watching it;  any David Lean film is a lovely experience that is an enchanting way to  while away a rainy Sunday afternoon. Enjoy!",964828800,28,2818,5.112087912087912
856357,4,6304366043,"After his hit successes with ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" David Lean apparently felt that he could handle any epic of any style. This original work shows that he may have overdone  it.  An adulterous love affair with a dashing British officer in  Ireland during WWI is the core of this film, similar to what we saw in  ""Zhivago"". The rugged coastline and its people reflect what we  saw in ""Lawrence"". However the photography is simply gorgeous and  ravishingingly beautiful. The best performance is no doubt Sir John Mills  as the village dummy who can't speak but understands the human events that  swirl around him without reason, deservedly winning him an Oscar for this  film, as did the photography.  Attractive and appealing, but not of the  same heights or nature as with Lean's earlier creations. Novel adaptations  seem to work better in his favor.",933120000,15,871,4.931034482758621

856530,5,6304366043,The film misses the smell of the wild flowers and the friendliness of the villagers.  It does include children as extras from the village.  I studied in the school house (spilit in two for girls and boys) in the summer of 1971.  I was studying Irish. We all stayed in Dun An Oir which was a hotel at the time.  It was great fun once I solved the homesickness with the help of my great classmates.  Many students were from the midwest where the Irish American Cultural Institute was located at that time.  I first went to Ireland at age 10 and swore I would be back.  I think it is one of the most beutiful places in the world and the friendliest.  I toured the Great Blasket Island on a day the boat could travel safely. Today I think it has a museum or restoration village.  Then it was wild and pristine with the most beautiful untouched beach.,1502150400,,846,4.270440251572327

856535,3,6304366043,"The problem with RYAN'S DAUGHTER is that the only interesting relationship in the film is the doomed one between Rosie and the English soldier.  Everyone else is a stereotype:  Trevor Howard is a convincing stereotypical priest; Robert Mitchum is an unconvincing stereotypical school teacher, but they're both shopworn figures.  And the relentless cruelty of the Irish townspeople is the dreariest stereotype of all.  Rosie and her English lover are exciting individuals who deserve to find happiness, but, of course, the script will not allow it.  See the film for its wonderful cinematography and Trevor Howard's riveting performance as a bucolic saint.  But don't expect to like an ending that rewards hypocrisy and despises carnality.  David Lean addresses some extremely thorny topics in RYAN'S DAUGHTER, but the ribbon he ties around them is too tidy by half.",1489795200,,865,5.3161764705882355
856536,5,6304366043,"As those of us who were around during the 1960s and paid attention to the movies if, like myself, for no other reason than cheap dates and darkness, might have expected if they heard the name David Lean they would fully expect to have big lush vistas and cinematic epics, long cinematic epics. He had an already established pedigree with Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. And Lean does not fail us with this 1970 effort, Ryans Daughter, about the troubled love affair between a wistful Rosy Ryan, played by Sarah Miles, and an invalided British Army Officer, played by Christopher Jones, during the heart of World War I and the brewing troubles in the fight for Irish independence.

In a later time the wistful, restless, searching, reaching for rainbows Rosy might have been a classic flower child. I know I had dates with just such wistful women back in the 1960s and delighted in their company, as long as I could hold their attention. But our Rosy had two very big problems, maybe three, back then and it is not quite clear to me even after watching the three and one half hour masterwork (I won't include extra time spent on the Special Features which were well worth checking out to get a feel for how an epic gathers itself together).

First and foremost she was a flower child, a free spirit in a rural Irish village isolated by the foaming sea and by its own staid traditions driven by the Roman church and an oppressed nation culture and while today a woman having an illicit affair would draw at most a few well-placed snickers back then the future held nothing but shaming, shunning and maybe worse. So her desire to seek a newer world as my old friend Sam Lowell would call what she was after was checked from minute one. Secondly, Rosy when she had that illicit affair was a very married women, married to a quiet man, a village intellectual, the widowed middle-aged village school teacher, Charles, played by Robert Mitchum. No man likes to be, or should like, to be cuckolded but Charles was the soul of rationality whatever emotional trauma was churning inside. A young lass and an older man set in his ways would seem to have been doomed from the start as both recognized in the end after the heat of her affair was terminated by the suicide of that troubled invalided army officer. Lastly Rosy was caught in the throes of the modern Irish struggle for national liberation where the nationalists were using Mother Englands troubles on the continent to spring for freedom. That made the British Army of Occupation all the more onerous. Made her their whore in the eyes of the locals. Worse made her subject to accusations, falsely as it turned out, of informing when the boyos from the IRA were trying to rescue weapons sent by the Germans which had been battered by the terrible wrath of Irish Sea and the British garrison was waiting in ambush for them up the road.

Name your chose of what would do Rosy in at the end (aided by a treacherous father who actually was a snitch) as she and Charles walked out of the village where they had stayed maybe too long but she paid dearly for that love-I hope she thought it was worth it. What, no question, is worth it is to watch this film unfold against the grandeur of the Irish countryside and those terrible seas.",1489622400,,3283,4.561016949152543

Sarah Miles as Katie in a love affair with a British officer injured physically and mentally by the war and assigned in Ireland; all add to the intrege of the moment and events that surround it.  Irish resistance to British rule and that element of the story make for a complicated twist of Irish/British conflict and history.

856755,3,6304366043,"A very dark movie, focusing on the shocking and despairing aspects of humankind - not that these don't exist - of course they do; but all media / genres highlight & basically ""serve up"" to the public whatever aspect they choose about life. So for a study in darkness, this is very well-done. But who needs to study that? I think what we need are lessons in light. Well this movie does some of that too, but kind of ""too little, too late."" The acting is fantastic, as acting goes. The setting is stark, riveting. The story will (unless you are a robot) leave you feeling like the shell-shocked victim of a train that went over a cliff.

I always ask myself, at the end of a program or movie or book, bottom line: what are they saying? What's the message? Because no way are programs, movies and books not messages. So what is the message of Ryan's daughter? Well, I can only tell you what it was to me, and I am, as they say in marketing, a random sample.

The message to me was: life is unbearably ugly, all but hopeless, but (& here is the ""too little, too late"") you can always start over, as long as you're not dead. OK, thanks...??

856869,4,6304366043,"David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt re-imagine Flaubert's classic Madame Bovary in a wild and wind-swept Irish setting. In the hands of the lesser-skilled, compelling personal stories might get lost amid the visual grandeur but Mr. Lean always knew his way around the cinematic canvass. He knew how to reveal volumes about the lives of his on-screen characters. Sarah Miles was perfectly cast as a vibrant beauty who gives in to emotions as wild and stormy as the Western Irish coast. Robert Mitchum is surprisingly effective as the husband tag-teamed by a handsome but emotionally-tortured British officer played by another American actor, Christopher Jones. Then there's veterans like John Mills who is simply heartbreaking and even a bit off-putting as the mentally-challenged Michael whose misguided actions prove pivotal to every important turn of the plot. At the time of its release, the critics were brutally negative in their assessment of the film and Lean was so depressed by the reviews that he almost quit making films. Ryan's Daughter is flawed but wonderfully so.

It is probably his most beautiful looking film thanks to Freddie Young's photography. The story itself is a small one that takes place during a tense period in the relations between Ireland and England. Perhaps the one big flaw is the setting up of that relationship in regards to where the story takes the viewer. I believe the casting of Christopher Jones was probably a mistake as well. He looks so much like James Dean, an American Icon, that it is distracting in this very European story. The real highlight is the triad of Sarah Miles, Trevor Howard and John Mills. Mills won an Oscar for his performance as the Village Idiot whose child like innocence becomes the mirror in which all the characters must see themselves. His performance may seem dated at times and walks the edge toward absurdity but he always brings it back and gives Michael the human side that makes him so important to the story. I enjoy this film.

857251,2,6304366043,"I remember when this move was released and the critiques were not at all kind to it.  Now, after seeing the movie, I agree and all of these 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon are incredible to me.  This is not another David Lean masterpiece, anywhere near the level of his other movies.  Basically, it is a movie with a good premise, gone bad.  The story is about Rosie (Ryan's daughter and I don't know why the title is called that, because the film has really nothing much to do with her being Ryan's daughter).  Rosie is a young school girl who has a crush on an older school teacher.  She wants more out of life than what this poor little village can offer and she thinks that marrying the school teacher will do the trick.  She finds out otherwise.  So far, so good, but after that, the movie disintegrates.

The movie is badly edited and there are no transitions between scenes.  Some scenes are just over extended and stretch on and on, long past when the impact or intent of the scene has been portrayed.  Which is why the movie is extraordinarily long.  For example, the first love scene between Rosie and her lover is shown and then they make love again and the second portrayal is so close to the first one that one wonders whether they just showed the same thing twice.  Why?  Then there is a horrific storm scene which, though beautifully photographed, goes on and on, long past the dramatic impact of this scene has been portrayed.... I mean how many minutes of crashing waves can you take?  And their wedding scene continues far too long.  We got the point long ago about the married couple in their new wedding bed with the noise coming from downstairs of the wedding party, disturbing their first night together.  These repetitive and overly long scenes just become boring.

The worst was the music.  I read that it was composed by Maurice Jarre and he actually got an Oscar for it.  Unbelievable.  It was very, very 60's music and grating, annoying and insipid.  But, aside from the musicality of it, the music accompanied every action in the film, to the point where you wanted to shout, shut the d__n music off!  The music tried to portray almost every aspect in the film, every action, every step, every hand gesture,  If someone is skipping, there is skipping music.  If someone is running, there is running music.  There is gay music, for fun times, and dramatic music (for storms of course).... most of which were variations of the same themed music that runs throughout the film.

And the characters!  Trevor Howard was the only one who acted well in his role as village priest.  Robert Mitchum was horribly miscast as well as misused, certainly cast against type.  He was supposed to be a meek village schoolteacher, but his physical presence and body type (and of course they had the obligatory scene where his shirt is off) resemble nothing like the character he plays.  He is a manly man when he is supposed to be a quiet unobtrusive schoolteacher type.  And then, of course, there is his Irish brogue that keeps coming and going.  Sarah Mile's face is mostly frozen.  If she had not have been so young when she made this film, I would have said it was frozen because of a bad face lift.  And finally, I do not know how or why John Mills (a fine renown English actor) was bamboozled into playing the role of the village idiot.  It was a gross charicature, made worse by physically portraying him as gap toothed (what teeth were left  were black and green and presumably rotting), walked with a huge stiff legged limp, and incapable of speech (but apparently not incapable of understanding). And he incessantly skipped around, grimacing. The crowning touch was something wadded into his right cheek to make his face look more deformed (along with his hair combed down covering his forehead),  He looked like Quasimodo, except for the non existent hump.

Things that just didn't make sense:

1. At the beginning of the film, a guy on bicycle (the constable?) was killed and dumped by the Irish rebels.  We never hear anything again about this man and I guess no one in the village notices over a period of months that he is gone!
2. When Rosie first sees her eventual lover, it is instantaneous love and passion, even though no word has passed between them.  She serves him a beer, he has a PTSD flashback, falls over and as she is trying too wake him, they wind up kissing.  We are to believe that some kind of electricity passed through them.  Finally, just  before the villagers enter, he thinks to ask her her name!  Which is the first thing he or she has said.
3.  The school teacher becomes suspicious of her and him, though there is nothing to indicate in the movie that he or anyone else has seen them together (and she is later attacked physically by the village women for infidelity, although again, no one has seen them together).
4.  Despite the above, one night (or a.m. --- impossible to tell because it's light outside), she goes outside and sees the lover who just happens to be meandering in the hills by her house.  She runs outside and there is the most cliched image, of the two running to come together, despite the fact that she is in clear view of her house.  Ayyyyy!
5.  Then, the husband must have awakened and he looks out the window (I gather he didn't check if she was elsewhere in the house) and sees them embracing.
6.  Towards the end (SPOILER.... that is, if you still want to watch this), there is a loud boom and we are led to believe that the lover killed himself although no one knows why.  Rosie somehow intuits that her lover is dead by the strange look on Michael's (the town idiot) face, although there is no reason for her to assume that the large boom had anything to do with him.
6.  The one I really loved is their constant show of footprints in the sand, footprints showing where people had walked, where they had gone, if it was male and female, etc. They were supposed to impart some significance. The funniest one is when the priest is looking for Mitchum for 2 days straight and finds him through the footprints in the sand, nothwithstanding that the normal waves, let alone the tide, would have erased them in no time flat.
7.  Finally, Rosie is very well dressed for the wife of a poor schooltecher in a very tiny poor village while the other village women have normal village type peasant clothing.

How could David Lean have made such a mess and how could people give it rave reviews?  The only good thing was the photography of the spectacular scenery.",1430352000,,6529,4.523037542662116

857319,4,6304366043,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Save for the exceptional lush landscapes and sweeping vistas of incandescent coastline, I found this film overly long with poor dialogue. At the two hour mark I was flabbergasted at how little had progressed with an entire hour to go. I could not muster the desire to write a disappointed review as David Lean is one of my all time favorite directors. However, my reaction to this film took time to settle in to discern the genius in it's methods.

Surprisingly, I had an intense nightmare the same evening, which is very rare. The longer lasting effects of those punctuated moments in the film glared from the screen in horror. The attempted collusion with the German army to extricate the English from their land, the flashbacks of battle, the aftermath of trauma, the treatment of innocent locals, the fury of a storm, the death knell for Freedom Fighters, etc. These moments were offset and almost hidden by the constant barrage of seemingly meaningless chatter and lullaby quality of protracted scenes. What a phenomenal surprise to see how deeply these sparse moments were permitted to sink in between the quieter more shallow treatments.

I am rarely amazed by films these days, but I recommend the experience for those who may be swayed by the negative reviews. I believe I still have yet to appreciate all the underlying messages of war, peace, love and contentment. I will wait a spell to absorb the overwhelming emotions and watch again. I was very young when I saw Dr. Zhivago on TV but it remains a lasting impression.

High recommend for David Lean fans, Ireland landscapes, and a rather lovely illicit romance.",1427241600,4,1667,4.859154929577465

857328,5,6304366043,"There are a lot of comments in the Reviews about the various formats in which this movie can be viewed. The movie was released in 1970 and without a doubt it would be most magnificent if viewed in a movie theatre. It is a wonderful movie with a wonderful ,well written and engrossing love story. As the story is well covered already;I want to mention a few other things. I doubt if one can find it anymore in a good theatre,now that it is 45 years since its release;so I guess it is a DVD or VHS or as some have suggested Blu Ray,if available,that you'll have to get to watch it. I have the 2-Tape VHS released by MGM.It has a running time of 3 hours 14 minutes. I notice that there is also a DVD version of 1 hour 45 minutes. I have not seen that shortened version,and can't imagine what has been eliminated,so can only suggest that one obtain the full-length version. As to sound and picture quality,I found the VHS excellent.
 This movie is outstanding in every way ,was an Academy Award winner and Rex Reed claimed it to be ""Best Picture of the Year"".
 It is an enchanting story ,the actors are outstanding ,and it is a movie that you will long remember.
 There is a short trailer here that has several scenes from the movie,and gives you a real good idea of the magnificent scenery and photography that you will be treated to,throughout the movie.

857412,4,6304366043,"The major criticism of the film at the time was that the it was a gigantic 70mm epic, and the story was quite small. I loved it, and visually it's incomparable. Lean uses the scenic splendour as a major character. Christopher Jones was chosen by David Lean from an earlier film role - but Lean was mortified to learn when he arrived on the set, that all his dialogue in the film that got him cast, was entirely dubbed by another actor. He thought Jones was British but he was American, and unfortunately he was unable to produce a convincing English accent. Jones was a complex man, but the error was nothing to do with him. Lean on the other hand had legendary issues with many of his actors, including Mitchum. Sarah Miles, who by all accounts was a major piece of work, disliked Jones on sight, because he was short. Or at least shorter than she expected. He was of average height in fact. And she gave him a seriously rough time. Naturally, Jones responded by becoming as unhelpful as possible. The filming of the love scene in the bluebells would fill an entire post, which would be amusing, if it wasn't for the fact that during the shooting, Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum were feeding Jones drugs - with David Lean's knowlege. The only person they didn't tell was Jones, who thought he was having a breakdown. Why they were doing this outrageous thing on a multi million dollar production, is anybody's guess, but it caused him to crash his car. He left the industry shortly after, deeply disillusioned. But after two huge hits, the critics were out to get Lean at all costs. He didn't make another film for many years because of the absurd vitriol poured on him after the film was released. All the local characters are brilliantly performed by mainly Irish actors, and the visuals are sensational. It's still very potent. Marie  Keen the late, great Irish actress is particularly good, and despite the general negative critical response, it was a box office hit, especially in the UK. Australia and New Zealand. BluRay please. It's a fabulous film, and if any film deserves the full visual treatment this one does. As
David Lean said, 'It's really Madame Bovary, but most of the critics were so stupid, they just didn't see it.'",1420934400,3,2238,4.63727959697733

857417,1,6304366043,"A despicable portrayal of the Irish people and Irish Nationalism which comes straight from the top drawer of English zenophobia and a gloating attitude towards its colonial/imperial past - other nations have the maturity and moral courage to own up to their historical misdemeanours and atrocities - the English never do. They are despised and ridiculed in many parts of the world today - don't kid yourself otherwise - for doing so. Hence the Chinese let down Patten's car tyres after the official handover ceremony of Hong Kong and he had to cadge a lift back! Just one example.

Now the English have had their ass kicked blue by the IRA and were forced to negotiate rather than pursue a military solution (like the Americans in Vietnam, bullies all) we can see a film like this for what it is: a piece of dirty cultural propaganda against the Irish.

It is a shame some sensitive if sluggish portrayals of character (which are deliberately slowly drawn I imagine to maximise the room for the caricaturing of the Irish nation) in other words, the work of some great actors here has been betrayed and bent in the service of such despicable ends. The same is true of the fine cinematography and beauty of much of the film.

It would be ever so wonderful if a high quality Blu Ray restoration might be released before long.  The 70mm visual splendors of the movie would obviously shine in that format.  Fortunately, the production is so beautiful that one can at least get a very good sense of its greatness from the DVD.

Music can certainly enhance the visual effect some films have on viewers...they give Academy Awards out for it! This visually stunning, well performed film about love, betrayal, civil unrest and poverty suffers from a nagging, cloyingly upbeat carnival-like score. The dramatic seascapes and passionate lovemaking...all played out with this cheery circus music. People are killed, harassed, almost felled by the elements (a stunning storm scene, brilliantly filmed), spirits are dimmed by the destitution suffered by the Irish under the hand of the British...but its all done with a sugary merry-go-round type background music so how bad could things really be? Maurice Jarre, the composer, has scored many great and dramatic films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dr. Zhivago"" for which he received Oscars. Director David Lean collaborated with him on this film so maybe that is the reason he didn't use rich Irish themes and dramatic musical passages in places they would do the most good. Robert Mitchum is surprisingly good in a role that calls for a meek, gentle school teacher who finds love in his middle years. Sarah Miles is good as the young, spoiled love interest (Julie Christie would have been better...my opinion).

857807,5,6304366043,"David Lean made three truly memorable epic films during the 1960's-70's (Lawrence of Arabia, Dr Zhivago and Ryan's Daughter).  I bought this one to complete my set.........filmed in the majestic Irish countryside this tale of forbidden love and betrayal during WWI and the early days of the growing Irish Republican Army, is rich in the character portrayals as well as the musical magic of Maurice Jarre.  Ryan, the village's worldly tavern owner, played by the great Englishman Leo McKern, leads a double life as a militia leader loyal to the IRA while pandering to the British occupational forces encamped outside the village.  His beautiful nubile daughter, portrayed by Sarah Miles, yearns to have a better life and sees the promise of this in marrying the local schoolteacher (Robert Mitchum , despite the age differences, gives a sensitive and heartfelt performance).  Despite the tepid protests by Ryan and the Catholic Priest (excellently casted Trevor Howard) the marriage occurs and after the postnuptial celebrations involving the entire village folk (and colorful they be!) the anxious Rosey settles into the marriage bed--her husband, painfully aware of the many years that separate them, constantly reassures his young wife that all will be as it should, ""in time"".  Rosy spends her days between the Tavern and being the good wife.....she feels the pains of regret growing within her when a chance encounter with the new, young Major (Christopher Jones).  Back from the front and scarred deeply (inside and out) he is vulnerable and haunted by the horrors he had seen and sent to command the British outpost on the edge of town.  It is now the fire of uncertainty and passion begin to engulf the unlikely lovers.....a relationship doomed from the start.  Thruout this spectacular film humor is maintained by the great John Mills, although not readily recognized by his makeup and mannerisms......as the part of Michael, the ""village idiot"" he stumbles innocently into situations foreign to his comprehension and with the guidance of the ever present Trevor Howard, teaches us all a lesson in humility and wonder.  A major cinematic event is captured on one rainy and windy night (as is so common on the Irish coast) when a German Merchant vessel attempts to send ashore crates of weapons, explosives and ammunition to the awaiting villagers.  The awesome pounding surf and stories-high waves pound the craggy coastline, dashing the secret cargo and spilling its lethal contents.  The people brave the surging seas, often binding themselves with thick ropes and having others to try to hold on while gathering what each wave presents onto shore....I cannot recollect ANY other storm  scene so majestically and spectacularly filmed and my pulse raced from scene to scene as the noble folk--men, women and children, valiantly banded together in this endeavor.  The love scenes between Rosy and the Major were so believable in tenderness and sincerity as were the lusty moments when he would stand on a knoll above the schoolhouse hoping to lure Rosy for one more meeting.  Scenes of the rich countryside as well as the seashore were most deserving of Freddy Young's Academy award for cinematography as was John Mill's Best Supporting Actor as the poor, simple-minded Michael.  A stellar cast and expert direction make Ryan's Daughter a must for your video library.  Rarely does a movie capture the passion and tenacity of the Irish people filmed in the wondrous ""Emerald Isle"".",1390521600,4,3488,5.136042402826855
857808,4,6304366043,"For someone so known for his cinematography, and there's plenty of that here, it is the details that mark this film. The husband taking the step away from his wife, when she's expecting -- yearning for!! -- the step to be taken toward her. The quick glance Rose gives herself in the mirror at the bar after meeting/kissing her soldier/lover for the first time. Not to see if there's a hair out of place; to see how she's looking.

And the storm scene is not to be believed. There is a wave that I swore was going to wash Leo McKern away.",1389139200,,537,4.264705882352941

I haven't a clue what that means. I only know I can't play it.  As far as a review of the movie, from what I remember it was a great film by one of my favorite directors,  David Lean.  This was the only Lean film I didn't own.  Maybe I can order it on NetFlex.  I would have returned it but I was unable to view it right away and by the time I did, the time had expired to return it.",1388880000,,627,3.8359375
857810,4,6304366043,"Ryan's Daughter has taken some tough critical knocks over the years, but in retrospect it's obvious the film was out of step with the changing style, critical tastes, and cultural politics of movie making when it hit screens in 1970. But to look at it today, with fresh eyes, the impression might be quite different - and vastly more appreciative. Of all the great 20th century film makers, David Lean made big screen epics that probably best anticipated the age of the flat screen, and in a hi def blu-ray - a format this film richly deserves to seen in - Ryan's Daughter will make compelling viewing. Aside from it's dazzling vistas of the Irish coast and the meticulous recreation of a rough-hewn, turn-of-the-century Irish sea village that provides the backdrop for the story of a tragic affair, Ryan's Daughter offers a passionate testament to the idea of big, bold film making that yearns to tell stories about real and complicated people - not mere stick figures in 3D simulated worlds we've grown accustomed to.",1388275200,3,1019,4.828571428571428

Her husband tolerates it and the small village ostracizes her. The town, the shame, the affair, boil over when an Irish revolutionary comes to town to get a shipment of guns. The cinematography is beyond compare. The angry sea boiling over and dashing against the huge rocks in a gale are in rich comparison to the angry mob in the village boiling with anger at this hapless girl who has loved the enemy. I would watch it again if for nothing else but the cinematography. This portion of the movie with the rugged Irish coast, the stark black rock bluffs that drop straight down into the ocean, the power of the waves smashing against those towers of black granite that send spume spraying up into the air like geysers.

Still a pretty good film.  Unbelievable cinematography that makes the Dingle peninsula itself a character.  Loosely based on Madame Bovary, so not a happy story at all.  It also portrays the Irish struggle as both noble and flawed because of the contradictions of the people fighting it.  Great acting by Mitchum, Howard, Mills and others.  I even like Jones as the British major even though David Lean thought he had miscast the role (which might be true as to his voice since they dub someone else's voice for his speaking parts, which were kept to a minimum).  Howard as the village priest gets all the best lines.  Mills won the Oscar for his portrayal as the village idiot.  Overly long, but worth it.",1370044800,4,860,4.532467532467533

The shoots are awe inspiring and Donegal is simply beautiful- wish Mitchum had gotten the Academy Award rather then John Miles- his is the only thing that does NOT hold up in the movie.  But I suppose he was a sentimental favorite of the time- it is worth watching over and over and if you really want a behind the senes look at how difficult it was to make buy the book about making the movie- it is hysterical especially the story of how they picked lovely Major she falls for with out testing him first- kind of killed the movie for me at first but then I still loved Mitchum and Miles and the actor who played the Priest sorry forgot his name.

As time goes by people pass but their art stays with us forever. Most of the actors in Ryans Daughter are long gone. This movie that was initially not a critical favorite has stood the test of time and is in my top ten along with such movies as Kelly's Heroes, The Graduate and so on.

So I ordered it and it arrived very quickly.  I really liked this film, the love story line was great and still sad.  I really liked the Director's notes and interview at the end.  I just hope that we don't encounter some of the bad weather depicted in the story.  I had to laugh though when I learned that some of the movie was filmed in another country (beach scenes), but all in all it was a good movie.  My husband said it was more like a 'chick flick' because the husband didn't really put a stop to his wife's infidelities - it was a little too romantic for his taste.  At least when we go to that part of the country and someone asks if we've seen the movie - I can say, ""Yes, I did!""

858411,4,6304366043,"No one would argue that David Lean wasn't an exceptionally talented director.  For Ryan's Daughter he assembled a talented cast and beautiful location (Ireland) to paint the picture of two lovers torn asunder by social and political forces.  Unfortunately, unlike Dr. Zvivago which was a critical and commercial success, Ryan's Daughter was unable to match the intensity or impact of Lean's other films.
The fault lies mostly in the direction by Lean - this film would have been served by another pass in the editing room to tighten up and shorten some of the scenes and in the case of the two lovers, slow it down a bit to allow the audience to buy into their intense attraction for each other.  I have read that the talented actor who plays Rosy's love interest (Christopher Jones as Major Doryan) was faulted for providing a flat performance - after watching this movie, it is obvious to me he (Christopher Jones) was scapegoated for the lack of more cohesive directing and editing.  Jones hit exactly the right note in portraying the Major as a tragic character - shell schocked from his time at the front and both physically and spiritually a broken man.  There are two seminal scenes in the film where the Major is stricken by his panic attack flashback to the fronts - these are beautifully and subtley played by Jones - watching him struggle to control himself and beat back the panic it is hard not to feel compassion for him.  The character Rosy, played by Sarah Miles, is also hurt by jumps in the story - the scene in the village bar where she meets the Major is rushed and not believable even by today's standards for attraction. Lean would have been better served he he allowed the characters some time to develop a rapport versus exploding into an immediate attraction which seems unlikely based on the social mores of the time and the circumstances of their meeting.  I think that Lean himself wasn't sure how to portray their instant attraction so the next time we see the lovers is in a long, drawn out, strange scene of them riding through the forest looking for a place to have a lover's tryst.  The scene is akward, slow moving and does nothing to help the audience invest emotionally with them.
While it is a flawed film - I rate it 4 starts due to the the acting which is superb, some beautiful camera work and a haunting and memorable score.  Sadly, Christopher Jones the young actor who played Major Doryan gave up movies after making this movie and Lean himself didn't make another movie for 14 years.  Yes worth a watch but expect some long scenes where you might want to use the remote to speed up a bit and do the editing that Lean and his crew should have done before the movie released!",1327708800,6,2717,4.583505154639175

David Lean's very interesting romance set in Northern Ireland in 1916. Robert Mitchum is almost type-cast as the sleepy-eyed and plodding village school - master, who marries young Sarah Miles. Christopher Jones is the British Officer who has an affair with Sarah during his stay in the village. But there are only two real stars of the show - the beautiful, sweeping scenery and John Mills, who won a supporting actor Academy Award, for his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal as the hunch - backed village idiot. Production designer, Stephen Grimes, obviously inspired by David Lean's extravagance, creates an entire village to use as the main set. Trevor Howard and Australian, Leo McKern are also very good in their roles.",1226707200,2,922,6.325396825396825
858599,4,6304366043,"Most would probably consider this a 70s chick flick, but it is far superior to that genre. These are characters imbued with all the frailties of real people. Sarah Miles had a brief run in the 70s on the A list of female British stars.  Though I was never a huge fan (she always projected a very fragile and neurotic vibe), she is perfect for the role of Rose, the refined, romance obsessed, spoiled daughter of the local pub keeper in a small village on the Western coast of Ireland. Her older cuckolded husband, the local grammar school teacher, is played to perfection and against type by Robert Mitchum. A man who loves her so deeply he cannot even bring himself to confront her regarding her affair with the handsome, young English officer who has been snatched from the front lines and assigned to this godforsaken outpost due to a bad case of post traumatic stress from WWI. The movie was unfairly panned when it was released. Although it may not suit the audiences of today who need gory slam bam action scenes in every frame to hold their attention, for those who enjoy a beautifully photographed landscape, and intense character development, along with grade A acting, this film will satisfy. The characters display the whole gamut of emotions and behaviors, noble and depraved, of which humans are capable. Robert Bolt's screenplay is to be credited greatly with the success of this film. Some of the scenes between the characters are so touching and heartbreakingly authentic that it is easy to forget these are not real people.  The one disappointment for me: though I have been a big fan of much of Maurice Jarre's film scores, this was not one that lived up to the subject. I found the music for the most part trivial and uninspiring, especially when it is contrasted with the exotic and breathtakingly beautiful locale. (If you haven't visited this part of the world, you will definitely want to after seeing this film). Another reviewer suggested that maybe American audiences didn't really get this film due to a lack of understanding of the Irish/English animosity. There is probably a lot of truth to that. I don't believe the repression of the Irish has ever been taught to any meaningful degree in American education, and one must self-educate on that topic. A good film to start with on that topic would be the ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"".",1226275200,5,2368,4.745145631067961

Several superb performances, but Sarah Miles is outstanding and not just as a beauty. She plays the part of Rosie Ryan to perfection and is totally convincing. Fabulous scenery though some of the shots, taken out of necessity on a South African beach, show water a bit too blue to be Ireland. Many notable scenes, but my favorite is the one with the couple in the bluebells  - an example of the proper use of silence being at least as effective as great dialogue.

858691,1,6304366043,"I am quite surprised at all the glowing reviews for this film.  With the exception of Trevor Howard, the acting was pretty bad.  Rose's love scenes with the English soldier did nothing to make the viewer believe this was a passionate love that could not be denied.  In fact, they didn't appear much different than her love scene with Robert Mitchum.  There was nothing about either Rose or the English soldier that would indicate irresistability.  Perhaps each was particulary attracted to woodenness.

While it was a good looking film in terms of scenery and mood, the story was rather ridiculous with many, many holes.  We are expected to believe that Rose and the English soldier had an incredibly close relationship, yet he hardly speaks to her.  I suppose the viewer must assume that the relationship was more developed than it appeared in the scenes they had together.  Why did the soldier commit suicide?  Because of the mess he had made of Rose's life?  Because of his apparent post-traumatic stress disorder?  Because he couldn't have Rose (for reasons, by the way, never made clear.  She expected to part with her husband, so why not?)

Basically, I found the love story unconvincing and the acting bad.  From a technical point of view, the DVD was disappointing in that the sound is terrible - very muffled which, together with the by and large fake Irish brogues, made the dialogue difficult to understand.  A disappointment all around.",1203465600,6,1448,4.897119341563786
858692,4,6304366043,"Director David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt are the same team that brought us Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago, so expectations prior to the release of this film must have been sky-high.  That being the case, I can understand why this film was panned by critics in 1970.  The pace is glacial.  At times, the film is so slow it seems to be going backward.  The film clocks in at 3 hours, 20 minutes, but the story could easily been told in under 2 hours, without sacrificing a single pertinent detail.  Easily.

That being said, there are some wonderful performances here.  John Mills, who plays Michael, the village idiot, won an Oscar for his outstanding performance.  But the strongest performance was Trevor Howard's.  Howard plays the village priest, heroically trying to exert an uplifting influence on his parishoners, most of whom are barely smarter than Michael, and much more savage.  Robert Mitchum is cast very much against type; in most roles, he exudes casual but strong virility, yet in this role he is called upon to play a milquetoast aesthete who cannot sexually satisfy his young wife.  And he does an excellent job, nailing the Irish accent, to boot.

The real star of the movie, however, is the beautiful west coast of Ireland, lovingly photographed.  This DVD looks absolutely gorgeous in an anamorphic widescreen 2-disk transfer.  The scenery alone is well worth the price of this DVD, even if you ignore the bloated, melodramatic plot.",1199664000,8,1465,4.902439024390244
858693,5,6304366043,"I don't know if this is David Lean's best film, because I haven't seen his earlier movies, but it is better than all his big budget movies, starting with ""The Bridge Over The River Kwai, and it is one of the all-time great movies. A relevant fact is that the screenwriter, Robert Bolt, was married to Sarah Miles, the actress who played Rose. They later divorced, and rumors had it that their relationship was the inspiration for the script. If so, Bolt rose above his personal pain in heroic fashion, because the straying wife in the movie is depicted very sympathetically.

  The movie received bad reviews originally, most famously from Pauline Kael. Since I haven't read her review, I'm not sure what her complaint was. I've always suspected that it didn't click with audiences at the time because Robert Mitchum was cast completely against type. Up to that point he had been one of the movies' sexiest leading men and always got the girl. In Ryan's daughter he was the older, cuckolded husband, who seems to be sexually repressed. I think this was too much of a shock for his fans (which probably included all adult filmgoers of the time.) Audiences don't like reminders of their own mortality. My God! Mitchum is that old?? Yet it was one of the most powerful performances of his life. He even managed a fine Irish accent.
  Also,the political situation between the British and Irish at that time may have confused American audiences, who probably thought Ireland was part of England and couldn't figure out why the picturesque locals hated the handsome soldier. Why are all those people with British accents (?) shooting at their own soldiers? The fact that it was happening during World War One was probably also confusing to Americans, who don't know their own history, much less Ireland's. And yet, the inter-relationship between the political events and the two love stories is perfectly handled by the script. In nearly all other war movies, the love story seems pitifully out of place. The audience simply can't figure out how that beautiful woman got herself into that battle, nor how she manages to keep her dress so spotless in the midst of all that mud! Or,if a love story throws in some historical events, it all seems like boring, unnecessary exposition. Here every word counts. Every scene between the lovers raises the sexual tension, and every scene with the Irish and the soldiers raises the stakes for everyone.
  There are two scenes in this movie which vault it into the best-of-all-time category. Both are the work of Robert Bolt, the scriptwriter, and both are entirely visual, with no dialogue. Both include the village idiot, a mute.
  SPOILER FOLLOWS
  In the first of these two scenes, the handsome soldier, new in town, stops in the pub to have a drink, trying to make friends with the locals. Rose, the barmaid, tries to be rude, since she has been taught to hate the British, but you can tell she is attracted. They are alone in the pub, except for the crazy mute, who begins to swing his leg mindlessly, banging it against the bar. It startles the soldier. Bang, bang, bang, in perfect merciless rhythm. The soldier tries to ignore it. The mute is happy, clueless. Bang, bang, bang. The soldier begins to crumble in front of our eyes as we see flashbacks of him in a trench in France, cringing in terror during a bombardment. Finally, he collapses, gasping on the floor, suffering a full-blown panic attack. Rose rushes to his aid, comforting him until his breathing slows and the horror leaves his eyes. It is a shockingly intimate moment, and entirely non-sexual. Yet after that moment, they are intimate, and they know it. He recovers, apologetic and confused, and leaves the pub. Rose thinks she knows why he was transferred from the Western Front to her sleepy Irish village: he was a coward under fire. But wait, he wears the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for bravery....
  The second of these perfect, wordless scenes is carefully prepared. The mute begins to imitate the new captain. He begins to follow him, marching in his clumsy way, saluting. And he puts bottle caps and ribbons on the breast of his tattered clothes to imitate the soldier's decorations. The villagers understand. Ah, he is imitating the captain. One day he is doing his impersonation in the main street, and the villagers are laughing. Rose appears and the mute walks up to her and puckers up, expecting a kiss. Suddenly, the villagers know the horrible truth about their Rose. The mute has seen her kissing the captain! Rose instantly knows that she has been betrayed, and that there is nothing she can say in her defense. From this point on, the concluding tragedy is inevitable.
  These two wordless scenes are perfect cinema and earned John Mills (the mute) an Oscar. There is a third instance of a major plot point being made visually, that is nearly as good. There is dialogue, but it is used by the characters to hide rather than reveal. Rose has been out riding her horse. Her husband says ""Where did you go?"" She replies, ""To the mountains."" She is in the other room, removing her riding clothes. He says, ""So, you didna go to the beach, then?"" She says again, ""No, to the mountains."" Then a closeup reveals that he is looking at her hat, which she left on the kitchen table. He is looking at the grains of sand on the bill of the hat. We see his face, we know that he knows she is lying, and why, and we also know that he will not confront her. These three scenes define the difference between books and movies. They are so perfect I can't figure out why Steven Spielberg hasn't stolen them.
  Another point that irritated the politically correct critics was the horrible punishment of the unfaithful wife, which seemed so Victorian in the hip 1970s. I would like to point out that Rose is not punished for adultery but for treason, and that she is innocent. Furthermore, she chooses not to save herself by revealing the name of the real traitor.
  I haven't seen this movie in thirty-seven years and I have never forgotten those scenes, and many, many others. Aside from the story and the characters, it also has the incredible photography that you can see in every David Lean movie. I'll bet a million people have visited the west of Ireland to experience personally the incredible landscapes they first saw in ""Ryan's Daughter.",1198281600,11,6366,4.734417344173441
858694,4,6304366043,"Another curate's egg from Lean, but redeemed by one of Robert Mitchum's greatest ever performances, bravely cast against type as the gentle Irish schoolteacher who becomes the village joke when his young wife takes up with a shell-shocked British officer. Ignored at the time for the showier attractions of Mills' village idiot (a role Norman Wisdom desperately wanted), it's a remarkably intelligent and subtly observed character study that holds far more appeal than Sarah Miles' title role. As always, Lean reserves the real talent (Mills, Trevor Howard, Leo McKern) for the sidelines and comes up with one of his blandest leads in the shape of Peter O'Toole lookalike and future down-and-out Jones while the force of history is reduced to background for a simple love story.

Maurice Jarre's score is something of a liability, but overall this is still the best of the director's post-Lawrence films and certainly not fully deserving of the critical slating that led to his 17-year absence from the screen. There is still a very real sense of the cinematic, with both colour and the widescreen ratio exploited to the full, something the increasingly TV-conscious director refused to even attempt with the surprisingly poor A Passage to India.

Although much impact is lost in the step down from 70mm to TV screen - particularly during the vivid storm sequence - the widescreen DVD makes it seem like a different and much better film if you've only ever seen it panned-and-scanned before. With some excellent extras, it's a fine presentation.",1196899200,5,1545,5.102766798418973

858696,4,6304366043,"Often regarded as the masterful David Lean's ""least great"" film, this story of rural southwestern Ireland during the First World War is still an extremely beautiful exercise in film making. One of only two films in the last third of the twentieth century to be shot in 65 mm, a sort of cinematic precursor of today's high definition, Lean was on record in later years as saying this was the film he was both proudest of and also most frustrated by.

Concentrating more on its stark but lush physical setting than its characters (sometimes focusing on setting to the detriment of its characters) Ryan's Daughter is a story about one Rosy Ryan, the pampered, pretty young daughter of a famous town publican, Tom Ryan, who marries a kindly but much older schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy, and soon comes to regret that she has. Bored with her limited wedded life, spoiled, always wishing for things she cannot have, the pretentious Rosy becomes infatuated with a melancholy young British military officer who has been sent to her desolate corner of Ireland after returning home from France wounded in the leg. The townspeople in the area are an aggressively closed-minded and xenophobic lot, virulently anti-British and pro-Republican, and Rosy, fool though she sometimes seems, is aware of what her fate would be should her involvement with the tragic-natured Englishman be revealed. What Rosy is unaware of is that her celebrated father, the town's leading man, is also a double agent who feeds information on Republican activities back to the British. A risky practice to say the least.

Through it all the little town is kept under control by Father Collins, a stern presence in the community, feared, respected, deferred to by old and young. The phlegmatic Collins tries to direct Ryan's wayward daughter to be sensible in her life, but Rosy seems impelled toward behavior that can only bring ruin onto herself and those connected to her. Her recklessness makes Rosy far less a sympathetic person than an annoying one. She clearly and repeatedly places herself above others and accepts others' hardships as a small price for her own comfort. Her moment of possible redemption late in the film opens the door to hope for her, but the impression is that this is but a brief aberration in a deep-set egotism that is probably unshakable.

This movie is famous for its scene filmed on a beach during an actual raging Atlantic gale, and even from the comfort of home to see multi-story waves break over and over amid furious winds makes you appreciate the commitment that went into making Ryan's Daughter what it was. All in all, however, Ryan's Daughter is not a great film. There is a paucity to its plot that deters its inclusion among the upper ranks of Lean's greatest works, and deep down the characters here breed their own destructions in ways that makes one feel their fates were warranted. The beauty of Ryan's Daughter is strictly visual rather than contemplative, and the truly best films of all time are those that brim with both.

858795,5,6304366043,"If you appreciate the oppression and abuse of the Irish by the British occupation,""The Troubles"", you will better understand this movie. In 1970 I loved this movie for the beautiful landscape, western Ireland with a focus on the Dingle Pennisula, and the performance of Robert Mitchum who deserved an academy award or at least a nomination. But with my present  fair knowledge of the historical resistance to the British rule in Ireland I appreciate the details and better understand the plot of ""Ryan's Daugther."" Rosy Ryan, played by Sarah Miles, is a rather spoiled young woman and daughter of the fairly affluent local pub owner, played wonderfully by Leo McKern.  She decides she wants more from life and seeks and subsequently convinces Charles the village teacher (Robert Mitchum)to marry her. With the knowledge of the intense opposition of the Irish toward British occupation it is understandable how the village people turn against their own when she develops an emotional and sexual relationship with a young British officer (played by Christopher Jones). The central plot is love of person, Rosy for the British officer, Charles for Rosy, Ryan for his daughter, and the Irish for their country. The secondary plot is betrayal of person and of country (I leave these betrayls for you to see in the movie).The village mute idiot, played by John Miles (who received an academy award for supporting actor) ties all the people and events together with his naive actions. This is a great film which is relevant today as the news announces another potential for the British to withdraw its rule from Ireland.  Don't hold you breath.  Although the actions or the present Irish people seem less intense than in 1916 the setting for this movie, their feelings may not be.  They want the Brits out of Ireland. But the British remain with one excuse after another. See this movie and I hope you will better understand as I did of the conflict ""The Troubles"" that the Irish have with British rule.

858797,5,6304366043,"I, like so many of its fans, cannot understand what was in the minds of critics at the time who bashed this film.  No, it is certainly not Quiet Man, and thank God for that.  The Ireland reflected in Ryan's Daughter is not your quaint, leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved by the world that doesn't know much about the real Ireland.  The atmosphere in this movie is haunting and disturbing and reflective of a great deal in Irish life, particularly at the time of the revolution against British rule.  The attitudes of the narrow-minded villagers was realistic and in line with the church-dominated lives they led, and the Irish are great begrudgers so their jealousy of the lovely daughter of the local publican is quite believable.  However, this story of a young woman married to a respectable and kindly older man but yearning for romantic love takes on a greater significance when it addresses the deeper issues involved: retribution, redemption, forgiveness, betrayal and loyalty.  The love scenes between Sara Miles and Christopher Jones, playing the shell-shocked British soldier who arouses the desire she has kept under wraps, are some of the most intense and moving I've seen.  When they become enmeshed in the village's suspicions, prejudices and hatred of the English, all set against the backdrop of the brooding and rather sinister Irish countryside, the tragedy is set in place.  This is a riveting film filled with outstanding performances, beautiful scenery and universal themes.  Robert Mitchum in particular is outstanding in what may have been his best ever performance, and one very much against type. And, of course, there is the ever-present star of the show, Ireland, the incredibly beautiful land of saints and scholars, informers and patriots, martyrs and conspirators.

858799,5,6304366043,"""Ryan's Daughter"" is one of the finest films in cinema history. It is the third and best of the great trilogy of films made by David Lean (director) Robert Bolt (screenwriter) and Maurice Jarre (music). The first two were ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"". The film is visually and emotionally as powerful as the wild scenery and weather of Ireland's west coast which feature so prominently. The story of a young woman's struggle to find something special in life, and her ostracism from her close knit community, set amidst the historical turmoil of the Irish rebellion of 1916, is utterly compelling. The performances of this glittering cast are breathtaking. John Mills (Michael - the village idiot) received a richly-deserved Academy Award for his role - in which he at no stage utters a word. Trevor Howard as the village priest contributes his finest ever performance. Leo McKern as Ryan plays a role with flamboyance and emotional complexity. Robert Mitchum as the cuckolded husband is brave, understated and exactly right. Sarah Miles, in the lead role, plays a character who is transformed by the experiences she undergoes. The film received poor critical reviews at the time of its release (from the same reviewers who had praised ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago""), although it did reasonably well at the box office. It is as if the reviewers didn't want David Lean to become too big a figure in the film world. Robert Bolt (his other credits include ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""The Mission"") demonstrates his talent as a screenwriter of powerful drama with this masterpiece.

The scope of the story goes from minimalist in depicting the characters to grandiose in the way ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""The Bridge over the River Kwai"" was. It is a long movie, but the story flows and it brings Ireland to life in a way not seen since ""The Quiet Man"".

Cinematography and music are as usual the best you can find. And the actors, severely criticized over the years make some of their best performances.

858804,5,6304366043,"David Lean created this version of 'Madame Bovary' on Irish terrain late in his carreer, and he may have done his best job, if not for 'Brief Encounter' -my other Lean favorite-.

This film has it all. There's not a subject that can't be picked by the absortion of it, since society v. the individual are depicted honestly and naturally.

This is a great work, of the kind of masterpieces of other genres: painting (Irish west coast); literature (with the eternal characters that compound the human canvas, as in another Shakespeare plot); music (Maurice Jarre's score fits perfectly).

But to me the most important thing about it is that, continually, the movie was reminding me of different scenes from the New Testament. So this is a 'real-as-life' movie. The Pharisees (politicians and their idolaters) one the one hand, and the individual or victim (Christ, the adulterous woman, the innocent child...) on the other.

History repeats itself. But Christ not only will judge the individual, but also the nations, according to what they have done the His Son. You could talk of so many subjects after watching this beautiful film that you'd never end. You have from pride, treason, sexual lust, ignorance, cruelty etc.  to sacrifice, forgiveness, God's creation of nature, spirituality, duty, devotion, humbleness, innocence, kindness, love.

Lean was so devastated that he didn't direct another film for 14 years.  As usual, critics have shown their ignorance once again (like on Heaven's Gate).  This is a great epic film, with some of the most intense scenes ever committed to celluloid.  The storm sequences, which took months to film, is brilliant.  There were no trick shots used.  No CGI (this was 1970).  Everything you see is real, which makes it even more fantastic.  The performances are wonderful all around, Freddie Young's 70mm photography is fabulous, and Lean's direction assured.  Especially telling is Robert Mitchum, who gives a wonderfully understated performance, in total contrast to his tough guy image.  Lean is a master craftsman/artist, and this film is fabulous.  Many people have posted good reviews here, and kudos to them.  Ignore critics.  If you want to see a film, see it.  Too often critics are way behind the curve...",1145059200,10,1051,4.925714285714286
858926,4,6304366043,"It's no surprise to me that David Lean's penultimate film, 1970's ""Ryan's Daughter"", is the last of his epic films to receive the deluxe DVD treatment since it is likely the most maligned and misunderstood. However, the 2006 two-disc package really shows a genuinely affecting, WWI-era romantic melodrama set against the stormy western coast of Ireland. Calling it a sweeping epic does not really do justice to the splendid visuals that Lean and his favorite cameraman Freddie Young present here (Ireland's Dingle peninsula looks stunning), yet at its core is an intimate love triangle that raises the ire of the village given the political frictions between Britain and Ireland. It seems a shame that the film was so lambasted when it was released since expectations were set so high after Lean's previous three films, all three widescreen masterworks - 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", 1962's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and 1965's ""Doctor Zhivago"".

Written by Robert Bolt (who also wrote ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago"") as a Celtic variation on Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"", the plot is focused on Rosy, the spoiled, headstrong daughter of Thomas Ryan, the local publican. She seeks a more cultured life and sets her sights on Charles Shaughnessy, the educated schoolmaster. Rosy makes the naive presumption that Charles' worldliness represents great passion but finds out otherwise on their wedding night. Enter Major Randolph Doryan, the young, shell-shocked British soldier assigned to take command of the local army detachment. Doryan and Rosy enter into a passionate affair, but it's a matter of time before Charles and the rest of the village find out. Meanwhile, a band of Irish rebels led by Tim O'Leary are intent on retrieving a shipment of German arms in order to take umbrage against the unwelcome British occupiers. The two plot strands merge, and tragic consequences ensue.

There are certainly moments of excessive, florid abandon in the film, especially when Lean focuses on the illicit lovers. The director goes all out in making the lovemaking scenes between Rosy and Doryan combustible, first in the pub amid Doryan's traumatic flashbacks of exploding bombs and then in a lengthy and surprisingly carnal scene in a wooded enclave. Their mutual rapture is at turns moving and titillating. The other drawback is that unlike ""Zhivago"" or ""Lawrence"", Lean does not really integrate the political backdrop of the story fully into the triangle plot. Rather, he uses it more as a plot device to give the story a greater historical resonance. At the same time, some sequences highlight Lean's brilliance as a film auteur, for example, when Charles gradually discovers the reality of his wife's indiscretion on the beach or the aftermath of the town pillaging when Rosy is brutalized for her alleged role in helping the British. From a technical standpoint, Lean's pure cinematic mastery can be best seen in the storm sequence, when the town bands together to get the boxes of artillery. Maurice Jarre's music is memorable, as his haunting theme plays constantly throughout.

The performances are variable, though all the key players provide strong moments. Sarah Miles handles the difficult role of Rosy with dexterity, especially as she runs the risk of alienating the viewer with her extramarital deception. In what has to be the most atypical role of his lengthy career, Robert Mitchum is a revelation as Charles. His natural tough-guy veneer has been completely subverted to play a passive, accepting man whose love for Rosy remains unsullied by the harsh reality of her adulterous behavior. It's a masterful performance because with a minimum of fuss, Mitchum taps into the depth of despair experienced by the cuckold husband. Looking pained and obviously cast for his James Dean-like demeanor and look, Christopher Jones portrays Doryan with brooding stares and a minimum of dialogue. Lean does what he can to camouflage Jones' comparatively stoic performance, but the result still provides a sagging imbalance to the love triangle. A heavily made up John Mills plays the mute gargoyle-like Michael as a series of tics and befuddled looks. Leo McKern effectively plays Ryan for the weak-willed hypocrite that his character is, and his emotional abandonment of his daughter is quite affecting. As Father Collins, Trevor Howard has a wild-eyed look about him at times, but he passionately provides the moral compass for the story.

As the movie runs for three hours and fifteen minutes (actually shorter than ""Lawrence"" and the same as ""Zhivago""), the film is spread across two discs separated by an intermission. In fact, like any epic, there is orchestral music for the overture, intermission (which ends part 1), entr'acte (which begins part 2) and ending. The print quality is superior and the sound even better. The commentary track has several participants who take turns commenting on the scenes. DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau smartly introduces each speaker in order to avoid confusion, and the differing perspectives can be quite interesting. Disc 2 has a solid, hour-long 2006 documentary, ""The Making of Ryan's Daughter"" divided into three chapters, as well as a couple of production shorts made at the time of filming.",1144886400,19,5241,5.198816568047337
858927,5,6304366043,"...including the Amazon.com critic. I daresay that Ryan's Daughter is David Lean's greatest movie - yes, even better than Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia.  Unlike the critics who lambasted the ""miscasting"" of the actors, I say that Sarah Miles (the younger adulteress) and John Mills (the village idiot) - both of whom earned Oscar nominations, with Mills winning his outright - were perfect for their roles, as were performances by Trevor Howard (the in-your-face yet wise priest), Leon McKern (the blustery yet traitorous father/publican), and Christopher Jones (the war-torn and lonely British Major). Even American Robert Mitchum played a believable duped, middle-aged husband - Irish accent and all.  But no, the critics were quick to dump on Mitchum for taking a part outside his typical tough-guy role.  It was like the critics expected him to beat the tar out of the British Major in the end (I guess then they would have been satisfied.)  But Mitchum did something that the critics failed to see before - the man acted his role perfectly.

Overall, the plot is tight for a three-hour-plus long movie and each scene adds to the overall plot.  The amazing thing about this script is that you can't help to root (and feel sorry) for the adulteress, her soldier lover, her husband, the priest, the Irish rebels, the British soldiers, even the village idiot.  The only people you hate outright are the narrow-minded, hateful, lazy villagers.  You even feel sorry for the publican who finds himself in an impossible position as he betrays first the rebels and then his own daughter.

Outstanding acting aside, the cinematography of Ryan's Daughter is incredible.  You cannot help but be amazed at the beauty and grandeur of the coastline of Western Ireland.  The storm scene where Irish rebels and the villages pluck German weapons and explosives off the sea-ravished rocks is unparalleled in movie history.  (And this is before digital creation). I wonder how long Lean waited for such a storm to appear and then direct the actors/stuntmen in accordance with the dictates of the storm?

Like all Lean directed movies, he uses sweeping vistas to show the immensity of space. He illustrates the pull of adultery with natural scenic symbolism as the lust-struck couple seeks privacy for their coupling.  How many directors even bother nowadays with photographic symbolism? Not many considering the audiences of today who go to movies to react rather than to think.

Ryan's Daughter is a perfect tale of betrayal, lust, love, and beauty - elements all found in other Lean movies, but perfected to artform in this epic.

David Lean created his masterpiece in Ryan's Daughter...too bad only a few really see his genius here.  The critics are fools.",1144368000,26,2749,5.033112582781457
858928,4,6304366043,"David Lean's long (the adulterers don't even start boffing until 1 hour and 47 minutes in to this long - 3 1/2 hour) lusciously filmed lascivious movie, set against the backdrop of the ""Wild West of Ireland"" during the Irish Rebellion of 1916, is a lovely period piece about forbidden love.  John Mills (Haley's Daddy) deserved his Supporting Actor Oscar for his touching portrayal of Michael, the ""Village Idiot"" who displays more sense than most of the village. Mitchum plays well against type as the cuckolded village schoolmaster, and Trevor Howard `tis grand as the priest pressed to preside over the whole mess of it.

By today's standards, it moves too slowly. Robert Mitchum is seriously miscast. Maurice Jarre's score is an overblown outrage which nearly wrecks everything.

But give Lean a chance. He is, after all, a Grand Master. Be patient with his leisurely pacing; allow the windswept, desolate landscape and magical lighting to work its enchantment.

It's a tone poem, you see.

One of the opening titles proudly announces, ""Photographed in Super Panavision on the west coast of Ireland."" What director nowadays cares enough to demand the finest image quality possible? Who has the clout to insist on months of expensive location shooting, when digital ""money shots"" are only a point and click away? Not even Steven Spielberg, the most powerful director in Hollywood, has ever made a genuine 70mm epic! RYAN'S DAUGHTER represents the end of a grand tradition: Movies in which the natural grandeur of the settings, and the vastness and clarity of the presentation, were important reasons for seeing the film.

And the DVD really delivers. The anamorphic picture, made from the original 65mm negative, looks as if it was filmed yesterday. Not a scratch or speck of dust are visible. The image is sharp as a tack, and the colors are beautifully graded, with a wide tonal range and no digital artifacts. Visually, this is a reference quality disc.

The sound isn't bad for the period. The stereo image is broad and clean, but rather flat. This is a good one for headphones. Too bad there's no way to turn off Jarre's idiotic music. Imagine if Clannad, or some other traditional Irish band, had written the score instead!

Aside from Mitchum, who cannot be blamed, the cast is very fine. Even the minor roles are unusually well handled. Miles is heartbreakingly beautiful. The sex scenes are surprisingly erotic but unfailingly tasteful. The story has a fateful Irish edge; by the intermission, you know you're in for downward spiral of unremitting tragedy.

No, RYAN'S DAUGHTER is not as fine as LAWRENCE or ZHIVAGO or even A PASSAGE TO INDIA, but it's still very good indeed, and very beautiful. Well worth setting aside a rainy evening.",1142726400,7,2180,4.96978021978022

The sound has been remixed to Dolby Digital 5.1 and, though it is far from reference quality, supports the film very well.  (However, on my system, the music sounded incredibly flat.  Particularly the Overture.)

There is a bounty of extras that include a thoroughly engaging and informative audio commentary from a wide-range of participants.  The commentaries have been perfectly edited together to form a cohesive narrative that runs throughout the picture.  Very well done.  The additional DVD-specific documentary is of the traditional fare (helmed by the DVD extras master himself, Laurent Bouzereau), offering rare interviews with David Lean and writer, Robert Bolt, as well as recent interviews with many of the film's production crew, recent Lean biographers, and others.  Plenty of good stuff to go around.

All-in-all this is an outstanding DVD release for one of Lean's most under-appreciated works.  If you haven't seen it, get this DVD.  If you have seen it, get this DVD, it will be a welcomed addition to your collection.",1139875200,9,2209,5.080555555555556

I have 4 all-time fave directors, and the other 3 are Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Kurosawa. If you share my taste in films, grab this one.

Warner Home Video has done yet another amazing job here. Oh, my God, how beautiful is this movie?!! The anamorphic transfer and Dolby Surround make it look and sound like it was filmed last week. The stark tragedy (cribbed from MADAME BOVARY) is set in gorgeous coastal Ireland during the 1916-21 Rebellion, with a truly impressive cast. Mitchum, Howard, Mills (who won an Oscar), McKern, and lovely Sarah Miles--all of them never better than they are here. Christopher Jones, though not in their league, is used to good effect. Freddie Young's Oscar-winning cinematography and Maurice Jarre's wistful score round out the package. The result is a work of great power and intelligence.

The critics in 1970 trashed RYAN'S DAUGHTER for its old-fashioned technique and romanticism, and they dismissed it as ""Lean's Folly."" Well, they were wrong. You've heard the expression, ""His biggest flop is better than everyone else's best effort."" This film proves it. Nobody makes movies like this man. Nobody. This is a voluptuous example of the lost art of cinematic storytelling.",1139529600,77,1398,5.069565217391304

This film focuses on a small coastal Irish town during the war for independence from British occupation.  What is large here is the emotions.  Whether we're talking about the ilicit affair between Rosy(Sarah Miles), the frustrated teachers wife, and a shellshocked British officer or the anti-British fervor among the locals the emotions are large here.  Scriptwriter Robert Bolt fashions a script here that is deep in characterization.  The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent with probably Robert Mitchum's staid teacher, Trevor Howard's consciencious priest, and John Mills' simpleton being the standouts.  If for anything else see this film for Freddie Young's sumptuous cinematography.  This has to be one of the best looking film's ever.",1139529600,5,936,5.549295774647887

859036,5,6304366043,"I remember seeing this when it first came out. It was quite amazing, and one must commend the great David Lean for taking a relatively simple story and giving it legitimate epic stature. Oscar-winning cinematography and a glorious score by Lean regular, Maurice Jarre, add to the magnificence. The never nominated Sir John Mills won a most deserved Oscar; indeed, I didn't know it was him until the final credits rolled. Sarah Miles also received her only nomination, in a complex performance that is nothing short of perfection. After reading other reviews, no one mentioned the great Robert Mitchum who, pressured to get married, realizes that his young bride would soon be bored by his sexual impotence. He's probably the least concerned when her infidelity is brought to light. The beautiful Christopher Jones certainly made a mark; too bad he gave up on a film career. And I agree with a previous reviewer  that Lean's ""A Passage to India"" was sorely neglected. Everyone praises ""Kwai"", ""Lawrence"" & ""Zhivago"", but I find I've watched ""Passage"" much more than those others. ""Ryan's Daughter"" was also nominated for ""Best Sound"". Indeed, the turbulence of the Irish coast is almost a character unto itself. I'm very pleased that this film is coming out on a 2-disc DVD. I only wish I had a big-screen TV, but I'm also pleased that I had the opportunity to see it on the big screen, where its power blew me away.  UPDATE, 11-8-08: Watched it again, and loved it as much",1139097600,4,1472,4.8142292490118574
859037,5,6304366043,"I am happy ""Ryan's Daughter"" is coming out on DVD (finally!) and I agree with the other reviewers that it is one of Lean's masterpiece's of epic scope. But so far, all the accolades have been saved for ""Kwai,"" ""Lawrence"" (above all), and ""Zhivago."" Much less is said about ""A Passage to India,"" Master (Sir) Lean's consummate masterpiece, based on the E.M.Forster novel, perhaps because he made his own version of the story (changing beginning and ending). It is a movie where even the most minute character is developed, and a message for humanity (""only connect""), in ascending scale, is given in compelling dramatic fashion. I saw ""Ryan's Daughter"" when it came out in the big screen, and it is a dazzling romantic tragedy, fabulously photographed, and brilliantly acted. Can't wait to own the DVD and treasure it as I have all the other epics, five in all--the only epics, as a whole, that elevate the much-worn format in the 20th century. MY admiration increases every time I watch it, saying to myself what were those ""high-brow"" critics at the Algonquin Hotel, in New York, in 1970, thinking when the movie came out, making outrageous comments that the sensitive Lean took to heart and stayed away from moviemaking for fourteen year? Thanks to this edition, and the upcoming blu-ray, people at last can see it in all its magnificence. Encouraging to see all these comments from new and old viewers who feel as I do, and perhaps even higher, about this movie--which becomes better with time. Note on 9/20/2012: I have seen the DVD, many times, analyzed it, and written about it in great detail. My opinion of the movie stands, and I am happy to see that many reviewers before and after it have given it high marks. The admittedly slow-paced movie combines a perfectly structured plot, charactizations, expecially from the likes of Leo McKern, John Mills, who, as know, won an Oscar for his role as the mute lover of Rosie Ryan, Trevor Howard, who was nominated for an Oscar, and just about everyone in the village crowd. Despite his brawls with Lean, Robert Mitchum, playing against character, managed an almost perfect performance, first as the sexually limp husband, then rising to a giant on the screen in the final exit from the village mob; and even Christopher Jones has a stunning visual presence, though I wish they had allowed him to speak in his own voice, rather than in dubbed monosyllables. Sarah Miles could not have been more expressive of a woman wrapped in fantasy and then having a cruel awakening, after betraying both husband and lover. An intimate epic, with classic tragic contours, but also one of genuine spectacle in the storm sequences, unequalled since then, since no computer generated images can duplicate an actual filming of a natural event of such magnitude. This film offers many pleasures to the the cineaste, whether a university professor or ""man on the street,"" as Lean used to say. Add the vast landscape of western Ireland photographed by award-winning Freddie Young, and you have a stunning epic of drama, adventure, and a delicately woven plot. Modelled on Madame Bovary, by Flaubert, this is a woman's story, but no less that of a man, or men plus a crowd, maddened to a rage knowing this woman, Ryan's ""princess"" daughter, dared to dream of a flight to a world of freedom and romance, but paying for her dream at the end. Again, try the movie, if you want to taste this condemned (by some) masterpiece by David Lean.",1137715200,15,3465,4.80569514237856
859038,5,6304366043,"Beginning with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, the only David Lean film I would rate less than 5 stars is ""A Passage to India"" and I would give it 4.8.  ""Ryan's Daughter"" is simply one of those films that any serious creator of a DVD library should have on his/her top 25 list.  It is so spectacular that, for the life of me, I can't imagine what has taken so long for it to arrive in DVD format.  As with all his films, Lean's cinematography is truly unequalled, but there isn't a single ingredient with which one can find reasonable fault.  ""Ryan's Daughter"" is what filmmaking should always be and so rarely is.",1133049600,21,618,4.3478260869565215

859040,5,6304366043,"David Lean's earthy film takes place in a small village on the wild Irish seacoast.  World War I is raging in Europe, but the villagers have their own war - against the British soldiers who are camped nearby.  Teenage lovely, Rose Ryan (Sarah Miles), has a schoolgirl crush on her middle-aged teacher (Robert Mitchum) and dreams of becoming his wife.  When they do marry, she is immediately dissatisfied and seeks passion in the arms of the enemy, English Major Doryan (Christopher Jones).

Sarah Miles is perfect as the willful and conflicted young girl, and Mitchum, though an odd casting choice, is convincing as her kindly husband.  Trevor Howard gives a wonderful performance as the town priest who knows everybody's business, and John Mills certainly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar, playing a pitiful mute.  Christopher Jones has the right look as the tortured, shell-shocked soldier, but his acting is wooden and even though he utters only a handful of words, his voice had to be dubbed by another actor.

 The rough and wild coast is beautifully photographed in the director's sweeping style, and Maurice Jarre's soundtrack is haunting.  I was enchanted by this movie when it first came out, and still find it a lovely, sensual, and impressive film.

859042,5,6304366043,"""Ryan's Daughter"" was a unique David Lean offering, for it had no story prior to its original screenplay.  It does offer something that is quite different.  It is an epic that is really very small in scope.  Set against the Irish/British turbulence that exists even into today, the film tells the story of a very young woman who marries the wrong man (a schoolteacher played by Robert Mitchum, who lacks any real sexual awareness) and then falls in love with the wrong man (A British Sergeant who is stationed in her home town).  Ultimately she is found out and disgraced and she has no choice but to leave town.  Her father is an informer in the film, and John Mills (in an Oscar-winning performance) plays a mute, crippled human being who catches on all too soon to what Ryan's daughter is up to.  Sarah Miles deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance.  She is sensuous, young, forthright, fragile and ultimately heart-wrenching in her final scenes.  Robert Mitchum surprises in a very low-keyed role as her husband, and Christopher Jones is very fine as the soldier who has seen too much of war's devastation.  We witness it several times throughout the film.  Maurice Jarre's music is sensuos and then militaristic -- and all highly original.  Lean's palette is as beautiful as ever.  It is a long film, but one that I intend to re-view several times for its subtleties.  And just where is the DVD, MGM?  I hope they intend to release it.",1125187200,8,1460,4.719367588932807
859171,3,6304366043,"I've always been a very big David Lean fan. I think of him as the master of the epic. I enjoyed his early collaborations with Noel Coward and such films as ""Brief Encounter"" and ""In Which We Serve"" and I've also enjoyed his more celebrated titles; ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". But ""Ryan's Daughter"" is a mixed bag. Perhaps die-hard Lean fans will sing its praises but I want to remain unbiase. This is really a lesser effort from the great director.

Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles in an Oscar nominated role) wants more out of life after getting married to a man she claims to love, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum) but does not know what. The town's priest, Father Collins (Trevor Howard) tells her besides the love of a good man, her health, and money there is nothing more to ask for in life. But Rosy won't hear of such nonsense! She knows that there must be something more to life than what she has.

 Charles is a schoolteacher who's wife has passed away. And at first did not want to get involved with Rosy. He is after all twice her age. He figured Rosy would end up with a man her own age but no. It was Rosy who went after him.

 The film takes place during the early 1900s as the beginnings of WW1 linger in the air. But here's where the fault on the film lies. In the first 40-45 minutes of the movie it's hard not to pay attention to all the long shots Lean uses as we get shots of characters walking alongside the beach, we see mountains and beautiful landscapes. My objection to all of this is for what purpose is it done? It seems Lean wants to impress us with background more than the story. In his other works, say ""Doctor Zhivago"" I never felt the background was a distraction, here though Lean seems to want to give the film that big epic feel but it doesn't work.

 The reason of this may very well be the content of the story. The movie is about a love affair Rosy has with a British officer, (Christopher Jones) after her marriage to Charles and the stir it causes within the town. This story is not strong enough to go on for 4 hours. Lean makes the mistake of not injecting enough of the historical setting to the film. He seems to interested in the landscape setting to pay attention to anything else.

 While most of the performances are quite good I found I grew to dislike Michael (John Mills), the town's simpleton. What is his purpose in the film? He only gives the film a certain level of comic relief, but it's not needed. And what about the way the town treats him? It almost downright brutal. But his presence just came to annoy me. How odd than to find he won the Academy Award that year for Best Supporting Actor. But honestly what does the Academy know? I don't even bother to watch them anymore.

 Still despite these imperfections ""Ryan's Daughter"" managed to hold my attention. The performances by Mitchum and Howard are entertaining even though the movie never really give us the opportunity to know these people. We never really know what exactly happened to Randolph Doryan, the young British soldier. We never really know why Rosy is attracted to him. We never really know why Charles married her in the first place. But I still think many should see this movie. I find it funny so many people think of ""Doctor Zhivago"" as a lesser film. That movie is a masterpiece one of the greatest epic romances of all time. It's ""Ryan's Daughter"" that is the lesser film.

 Bottom-line: Entertaining yet somehow disappointing David Lean film. The movie seems to try to hard to impress us with its landscape but doesn't make much use of the historical setting. Still the performances in the film are worthwhile and for that you should this movie.",1123113600,5,3718,4.474150664697193

859179,1,6304366043,"The progress of David Lean's visual style is one of honest, thrilling emotion subsumed over the years by unnecessary, rote effect--an artistic hardening-of-the-arteries not entirely unlike the bloat of Wordsworth's later work.
Of his pictures which history will remember well, Lean delivered at least one masterpiece (""Oliver Twist,"" 1948), which dared to risk anachronism when it evoked the prison camps of WWII in its workhouse boys' scabby, balding heads--not to mention Alec Guinness's frightening Fagin (""What right have you to butcher me!?"").
He made two other first-rate pictures: ""Great Expectations"" (1946), a rare triumph of literary abbreviation, & ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957), the most melancholy meditation on suffering I've ever seen--like a paragraph from Dostoyevsky or Solzhenitsyn played deftly out to feature length.
""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) signalled, I think, the beginning of an elephantiasis in Lean's ambition--though it's been observed that ""Lawrence's"" minimalist compositions and love of ""empty"" screen-space may have primed audiences for later, more abstract adventures such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and even ""Apocalypse Now.""
Lean's respectful eye for and fascination with natural landscapes, especially as they dwarf people, and the psychologic import of that domination of scale, was often on ostentatious and useful display in his early and middle years. Later, this titanic style of framing became expected of Lean--not least, repeated viewings attest, by the man himself. It's as if he became trapped by his repute for monumentality, which was rarely less appropriate than here.
""Ryan's Daughter,"" based on a parlor-scale melodrama by Robert Bolt, never has the chance to escape Lean's Olympian regard and withers on film like a bug caught in the projector gate. Never mind the performances, which are generally credible, nor the cinematography, which (in the only home video available, a wretched panned-&-scanned dub with horrible color balance) is typically assured work from Freddie Young.

The cinematography is out of this world, and where all the villagers went down to the sea is so gripping that the viewer could be swept into the sea having to watch for his or her life.  David Lean makes all the characters very real.  What a powerful figure John Mills played as the village idiot.  Father Collins plays a country priest in this village along the west coast of Ireland, but he has tremendous knowing of the people and of life in general.  Rosy Shaughnessey is the young dreamer who falls in love with the dashing young British officer, and Rosy's husband, Charles who is much older than Rosy kindly keeps in the background, hoping the romance will die a natural death.  Some of the village characters are utterly vicious, and you are made to feel an intense dislike for them.
The political situation between England and Ireland is clearly defined throughout the movie.",1078790400,7,993,4.651428571428571
859312,5,6304366043,"I was given a copy of this film several years ago by my old uncle, and buried it, somehow unable to overcome a number of inherited prejudices about the film to ever put it on. When I finally did so I was staggered at my stupidity and the beauty and breadth of Lean's film.
What can I say now but see this film! It's one of the masterpieces of colour cinema. The setting, the politics of Irish nationalism at odds with the occupying British forces, the parallel stories of two kinds of love; there's just layer on layer of intrigue and complexity here, and even with its mighty length, nothing extraneous or long-winded exists in it.
There's so much in this movie, it puts most modern films to shame. It's not just in the story. The sheer power of the coastal landscape and its colour; the wonderful array of characters, even if there's a paucity of genuine Irish actors among the cast. Sarah Miles, a great and perhaps underrated actress, is unbelievable in her passion, a woman seeking a deeper connection with love than others around her, which leads her into big trouble. Mitchum is stoic and full of compassion and grace as her husband the schoolteacher; Trevor Howard plays the Catholic priest to the core; Leo McKern as Ryan the (re)publication sits well, and John Mills fills the shoes of a Shakespeare-like fool admirably.
Lean was a great interpreter of Charles Dickens' novels in the 1940s: those films stayed with me from childhood. I liked Brief Encounter but found it too dated; I was ambivalent about Lawrence of Arabia and found Passage to India a bit too drawn out. I guess that's what I feared with this film, that it was about a world and time (WWI) in which I was not interested, done in that exegetic style of Lean's for which I never really thought I had the time. After all, the full-length version is 204 minutes, and that's a lot of film for one sitting.
If you have the time, and like big experiences, with strong characters and emotional and political depth, this is the film for you.",1070755200,7,2010,4.570637119113574

859314,5,6304366043,"I first saw this film when it came out, it haunted me for days. The score9 by Maurice Jarre) and the photography(Freddie Young won a most desevred Oscar for) is breathtaking and Sarah Miles is so beautiful she takes your breath away. Set in Ireland during World War I and the British occupation of Ireland. Rosy Ryan( Sarah Miles) sets her cap for the local school master played by the great Robert Mitchum. They marry and her life is not what she expects until a British Officer enters it while she is tending bar. The chap is played by Christopher Jones who was the Colin Farrell of his day. The scene in the pub when they meet is one of the most tender loving scenes ever filmed. The affair that follows brings heartache to all. The villagers in this small Irish town gives lynch mobs a bad name. The pleasure they exact from teasing the village idiot(played by John Mills and may I add with beauty and heart) and later taking their revenge on an innocent person they believed to be the traitor. I don't want to give away the ending ot the story but I just purchased it and watched it for the first time in thirty years and was reminded what a storyteller David Lean was.

859315,4,6304366043,"I generally cannot stand Robert Mitchum, so I was pleasantly surprised by this classic. Here he is in an unusually low-key role as the long-suffering husband of fornicator Sarah Miles. He never overplays it and certainly got my sympathy. Trevor Howard is equally impressive as the local priest, and John Mills turns in a good performance as the village idiot, managing to evoke the right amount of pathos at the appropriate moments. On top of a great cast, there's a wonderful score by Maurice Jarre and beautiful location filming on the West coast of Ireland. Excellently directed and photographed (by recent Oscar-winner Freddie Young), this is an all-round entertaining movie, which manages to retain its grip till the end.",989452800,20,726,5.109243697478991
859316,4,6304366043,"This is a sensitive, heartfelt and mature masterpiece. An exploration of the fine and sometimes dangerous line between love and fantasy, all stitched seamlessly into an epic backdrop supplied by the struggle for independence in pre-republican Ireland. The movie is a little hindered by the casting of non-Irish actors, reminiscent of the absence of Russian actors in Lean's ""Dr. Zhivago."" But disregard this shortcoming and enjoy. There are moments of pure cinema in this film. Savor the jump to a lingering introductory shot of Rose Ryan's semi-fantasy British army officer, standing quietly in the middle distance on a remote country lane. This comes immediately after a noisy  and energetic close-up of Father Collins, on a beach, warning Rose that she might get what she wishes for. Best of all, for me, is the imagery conjured up later by Rose's increasingly suspicious husband, Charles Shaughnessy. He imagines himself silently watching Rose and her soldier strolling together in a scene of intense romance that he knows he himself could never provide for his wife. We watch Charles, on the screen, watching a vision of his own private fears and longings. Be sure to catch this wonderful, beautiful film.",981936000,13,1210,5.173469387755102
