8165371,1,B000LZ59LY,"After reviewing the brochure's claims of ""Instructional Training and Step by Step Lessons"" I was totally shocked when I purchased the DVD and viewed it. The claims are totally false. At best, it's a very poor overview only of Garmin's GPSMAP 60 units, nothing more than you could learn by turning the unit on and accessing its features and options yourself. The narrator highlights the unit's features but seldom explains or demonstrates in sufficient detail how to use them. Example; he discusses the use of tracks, however, he fails to provide you with a step-by-step demonstration regarding how you start and stop the tracks, MicroSD card save options etc.. The entire video lacks the little necessary details for each demonstrated area that the user would need to accomplish the task. Don't waste your money or time like I did, you probably could teach them more than this video has to offer you.",1250208000,8,900,4.927631578947368
8165372,1,B000LZ59LY,"This DVD really isn't worth your time or money. It has very basic information, and nothing more than what you'd get reading your quickstart guide.

Note : I have a GPSMap 60CSx - which, though advertised as featured, is NOT included in the instructions. I believe it is mentioned, once, but that's all.

Additional Note To Geocachers - That's not covered at all. Especially notable for the CSx user, because there is a geocaching feature of that unit. Not even mentioned on the DVD.

I cannot recommend this instructional video at all.

In addition, I also found the tone of instruction to be very condescending.",1219622400,12,612,4.8
8165373,2,B000LZ59LY,"I was disappointed with this product. It gives a rather superficial overview of the operation of the Garmin 60CS GPS. I expected an indepth discussion of the device, and this was not offered. Additionally, about 1/2 of the DVD was devoted to the advertising of other DVD's produced by the same company.

  Overall, not much better than the Garmin manual, which is also a disappointment.",1170201600,17,386,4.907692307692308
