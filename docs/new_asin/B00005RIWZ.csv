1656023,5,B00005RIWZ,"I enjoy a good murder mystery of the classical type, and the Brother Cadfael series are particularly good.  The film The Rose Rent, based  upon the book of the same name by Ellis Peters, (Edith Pargiter, 1913-1995)  is incredibly authentic and colorful.  The different orders of society: nobleman, servant, military man, tradesman, artisan, abbott, monk, and priest are carefully wrought to produce a period piece with more detail and clearer dialogue than a Shakespearean play.  It would be a wonderful way of introducing young people to history.
The setting is 12th Century England, a period of particular turmoil.  Henry I had died without a legitimate male heir, and he had designated his daughter Matilda as his successor, binding his nobles by oath to support her.  Although many of them did, including her very able half brother, an illegitimate son of Henry made an Earl by his father, many of them threw their support behind her cousin, Steven.  The warfare that ensued turned most of England into a battle ground and life for everyone a matter of ceaseless uncertainty.
Cadfael, the central character of the series, is a Dominican monk and herbalist, and Dereck Jacobi is the perfect personification of him.  He has a presence which suggests strength, wisdom, and compassion.  Unlike most of the other brothers, Cadfael had spent most of his life in the secular world where he participated in the crusades, had adventures, fell in and out of love, and took his order after finding the ways of the world wanting.  He comes from a different culture, that of Wales and sees that of England through an outsiders more objective eyes.  His experience with life and the motives of men and his keen awareness of detail makes him the perfect sleuth, and when murder is committed, the civil authorities, often personified by Hugh Beringer (Eorin McCarthy),  are often more than willing to have him clear things up for them.
In Rose Rent, a lovely widow has given the home and land that she shared with her beloved spouse to the Abbey for a single rose from its garden to be delivered to her yearly on the anniversary of his death.  Unknown to her several of the men in the village have their eye on her and her wealth, and see her devotion to her deceased spouse as an obstacle to their designs.  Murder is done, and it is left to Cadfael to discover the guilty party before another dies and before the pretty lady takes herself into holy orders because she considers herself a danger to others.  The tableau created is a rich tapestry of loss, greed, lust, violence and love.  An interesting way to spend an hour.",1027123200,2,2614,4.773333333333333
1656024,5,B00005RIWZ,"THE ROSE RENT consists of a single rose the Abbey of Saint Peter must pay each year for the use of a cottage owned by a devout and beautiful young widow (she who played the wise-cracking leftist journalist Anne in THE ICE HOUSE). The young widow no longer wishes to live in the home she once shared with her beloved husband..much to the sorrow of her cousin who would like to marry her himself (he played Mr. Bingham in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE). Having received permission to use the cottage to generate revenue, the Abbey leases the property to a middle-age craftsman and newcomer who is given to strange midnight rides into the nearby forest.
A young novice from the Abbey is drafted to tend the rose bushes at the cottage and appropriately he is also given the task of snipping and delivering the single ""rose rent"" each year on the anniversary of the death of the husband. The novice, who was himself ""given"" to the Abby when he was a small boy finds himself attracted to the beautiful young widow. Others detect his interest and soon he is accused of ""lusting after the flesh"" by one of the more puritanical of the Abbey Fathers.
The plot thickens when an untimely death occurs, and the cause of the death seems ""unnatural""...in fact Brother Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) suspects the death has been caused by arsenic the young novice has been using to dress the rose bushes. Has the novice taken leave of his senses and killed his accuser as Father Jerome insists, or are other forces at work? What of the craftsman? Where was he on the night of the murder which occurred in his own back yard? And the cousin? Has his desire for the young widow driven him to commit murder?
THE ROSE RENT is one of the most interesting and emotionally satisfying of the Cadfael stories. Those who have not read the books or who have difficulty following the machinations of the politics of the era will enjoy this film because it truly considers human emotions, desires, and character and is less reliant on some of the ""historical"" elements that drive the other stories (in other words one does not have to understand  the civil war between Stephen and Maude to follow the storyline).
I love the Cadfael stories no matter what..but this is one of my favorites and the cast is steller.",1006387200,9,2263,4.601485148514851
1656025,5,B00005RIWZ,"After the death of her husband, Lady Judith Perle (Kitty Aldrige) deeds The Rose House to the Abbey of St. Peter's as memories are painfully moribund for her.  The first Sunday of July, the monks are to pay Lady  Judith annual rent of one rose from the white rosebush which stands in The  Rose House's garden.
A year later events become entangled.  Brother  Eluric (Graham McGrath), whose duty it is to tend the rosebush and take the  rent to Lady Judith, is found dead one morning at the base of the bush  which, despite Eluric's tender care, is mysteriously dying.  A bloody knife  is at his side.  The young monk had less-than-holy secret thoughts about  the beautiful young widow.  He confided these thoughts to Brother Cadfael,  Shrewsbury expert murder- and mystery-solving monk, to whom gentlemen and  fair ladies frequently turn when they are in distress.
Eluric's death a  suicide?  Heaven forbid!  Brother Cadfael immediately unearths a fertile  clue to suggest otherwise as well as the decaying rosebush is the result of  a poisonous perpetrator.
Suspects are as plentiful and colorful as  Shrewsbury's Spring and Summer flowers.  Could the culprit be The Rose  House's new tenant Niall Bronzesmith (Tom Mannion).  He disappears almost  every night.  Come the dawn, he is found again carefully managing his  metalworks.  Oswin, Cadfael's bumbling assistant in the herbarium, digs up  some dirt on the enigmatic man which plants seeds of suspicion Niall's  way.
Thomas Hynde (Paul Whitby), whose wastrel ways have caused his own  father to cut him off completely, is but one suitor wanting to woo Lady  Judith.  What about Godfrey Fuller (Sebastian Abineri)?  He is dying to  join his dyeworks, and himself, to Lady Judith's mill and the beautiful  widow in order to make his business and life blossom in the shire.
Miles  Coliar (Crispin Bonham Carter), Judith's cousin who took charge of the mill  when the late Edward Perle first fell ill, he too has grounds for murder so  Cadfael discovers as he digs for clues.
Sir Derek Jacobi again turns in a  marvelous performance as the Medieval monk.  With a bit more than mayhem in  the air, the seldom seen tender side of Cadfael is unearthed an inch or two  in ""The Rose Rent.""  Eion McCarthy (Undersheriff Hugh Beringar)  and Terrence Hardiman (Abbot Radulphus) are Cadfael's perennial supporters  while Michael Culver (Prior Robert) and Julian Firth (Brother Jerome), they  are as prickly and nettlesome as ever.  Mark Charnock (Brother Oswin) may  be appear to be a blooming idiot at times, but he is endearing as he aids  and frequently abets Cadfael in keeping the Benedictines of St. Peter's  Abbey and Shrewsbury cleared of evildoers.
Scripted by Christopher  Russell and directed by Rick Stroud, ""The Rose Rent"" is another  highly suspenseful and entertaining offering by producer Stephen Smallwood.",922060800,15,2865,5.051612903225807

7952531,5,B00005RIWZ,"It is Cripples Day at Shrewsbury and this brings a mass of disabled pilgrims to the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, in the hopes that St. Winifred can cure them. We learn about St. Winifred's presents in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones."" Cadfael welcomes them while some of the other Brothers find it a nuisance.

Within a short while, a body is found in a leather sack amongst the visitors. No body is to leave. In an attempt to discover the culprit Cadfael boils down the man's body to inspect the bones and uncovers two possible explanations for his death. And yes they did leave.

Once again many things are not what they seem and it is up to Brother Cadfael to bring then to light. There are also parallel stories that may or may not have a bearing on the murder. One is of a seller of bogus relics. The other two brothers that are on a pilgrimage.

If you do not compare to the book it is a good film and well balanced. The movie has to tighten the story so some good guys in the book may have to go bad. (Do not forget that the first two chapters of the book are revealed in detail in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" and ""One Corpse Too Many"")This story takes place years later.",1501545600,,1179,4.185022026431718

I'm not usually into mysteries, esp. murder mysteries; but the acting and cinematography is awesome.

Anything that translates this well to a television format must be a great read.

7952536,4,B00005RIWZ,"I bought this because of my appreciation for the I Claudius series and was a little put off at first as I found the plots to be repetitive and the clues to be a little too obscure for belief, but warmed to it as I watched and ended with an overall positive regard for it.  It was a bit repetitive in the plot development and protagonist flow but like most of these English soaps had you comfortable with the characters soon enough and gave thought to what life must have been like back at the beginning of the last millennial period before civilization really got rolling.  I would recommend this product based on the lead actor whom I liked alone.  The rest of the presentation can be summed up as a simple product about simple times.",1347235200,,735,4.389705882352941
7952537,5,B00005RIWZ,"This one is after a three-year break, but I have no way of knowing whether the show ran through those three years or not. I think someone different is playing Hugh Berenger, but that could just be the natural aging of the actor. In any case, the writers seem to have matured some. This is a satisfyingly complicated plot, and while the actual murderer was one I sort of suspected early on, I had not stuck to him. The raising and dashing of suspicions went on very well in this one.

Edward Perle is suffering horribly from some clearly terminal disease. His wife Judith, who loves him, is agonized that she can do so little to help him. But Brother Cadfael is there with his potions. He gives Judith a small vial and says to give him just a thimbleful, which should ease the pain, at which Edward cries out that nothing eases the pain. But, says Cadfael, be very careful, because two thimblefuls might well ease his pain forever.

Next scene we are attending Edward's funeral, with his beautiful widow in elegant weeds, and several characters discussing how beautiful she is and how much she will need a new husband. Godfrey Fuller, the wool merchant, is fat and, in his own words, has much to offer her in material goods. Thomas Hynde, a rather useless dandy who has been disinherited by his father, says that he can give her what she ""really"" needs, since she already has wealth. Miles Colier, her cousin, knows she will not accept a close kin for ""fear of madness."" Bertrad, her workman in the weaving shop she inherited from her husband, just sort of leers.

OK, so there are quite a few people interested in her. But she's not only grieving for her husband, she's suffering from guilt which she discusses with Brother Cadfael, who implies that he knew darn well she gave Edward enough potion to end his pain permanently, and does not disapprove. Edward was dying anyway, and she only did it to end his pain.

She decides to deed her home to the Abbey, save only that they are to pay her one white rose from her husband's garden to remind her of him, once a year on the first of July. Young Brother Eluric has been tending the roses and praying fervently for Edward Perle's soul. So he is assigned the task of taking the first year's rent to Judith. Unfortunately, here is one more man bewitched by her beauty and fine character. He suffers terrible guilt for it, however, as he has taken a vow.

So the brothers at the abbey are only too quick to assume he is a suicide when he is found dead, the knife covered with blood by his hand. But Cadfael is not fooled, and notes several bits of evidence that show he was murdered instead.

OK, I've got you up to the first murder. There's another. Plus someone poisoning the rose bush. It's enough to keep you guessing right to the end.",1336780800,,2785,4.461689587426326
7952538,2,B00005RIWZ,"I will never really understand why the director of the Cadfael movies made some of them so faithful to the book, and the other totally off-course. This one, the Rose Rent, is definitely in the latter category. :-(

The basic plot is that a wealthy young widow, Judith Perle, deeds her spacious house in the Foregate to Cadfael's abbey after her husband died there; the rent she demands is simply one rose from the bush at the house, delivered annually. She is thereafter bothered by suiters hunting after her money, (she is the sole owner of a very large weaving business) and by a more deadly chain of events in connection with the rose bush and the house in the Foregate - culminating with Judith's own disappearance.

As others have mentioned, the biggest problem with this movie is that Judith performs a mercy killing on her husband while he is dying - aided and abetted by Cadfael. This is totally contrary to both their natures in the book, and is an absolutely unnecessary addition. This also brings me to the changes in Judith's character: in the book, she is kind, calm and strong, only occasionally showing passion or grief. In the movie, she is weepy and sarcastic, and instead of calmly turning down her suiters, she cries wildly and yells at them that she will never marry again. (?!)

Another problem that I have is that Brother Eluric (I'm assuming that you've read the book here :P) says truly, in the book, that Judith was absolutely unaware of his affection for her, and that it was all his fault; while in the movie she is constantly giving him long 'looks', and confesses to Cadfael afterwards that she was attracted to him. This leads to the third problem I have with the movie: that the reason Judith wants to enter a convent is guilt that she is beginning to feel attracted to men once again, while in the book, it was merely grief for her husband.

Point number four: the character of Niall Bronzesmith is not at all like it is in the book; he is rude, short tempered, and portrayed as a 'nomad' type that no one trusts - not even Cadfael. This is attributed to the fact that his wife drowned while running off with a lover years ago, while in the book she died in childbirth. So that is a big problem as far as I am concerned.

(Warning: spoilers from this point on!)

One of the things I have always appreciated in the book was the relationship between Judith and Vivian (in the movie ""Thomas"") Hynde while she is is his captor in the old counting house; he is simply weak and silly and vain, and after her first fright while he was taking her away, she is decidedly in control and the stronger of the two of them; he even begs her to help get him out of the mess he had made, after the first day or so. And this is one of the main reasons that Judith refuses to denounce him in the book; that he is ""no great villain, only vain and foolish"". In the movie, he is terribly rough with her, even going as far as gaging and binding her, and is on the point of attacking her when they both hear sounds outside...Bertred, of course. (The character of Bertred is also messed around with, but as he is not a very big part of either book or movie, I won't go into that.)

And the change that pervades the whole movie more than any other is Miles'  motive for committing the crimes. (Miles is her cousin who helps her run the weaving business.) In the book, he coldly calculates how to turn things to his own gain, and does anything to get it that way - even murder. In the movie, his crimes are committed through an insane, maniacal love for Judith; though I don't see how the attack on the rose bush (done with white lead in the movie) and the murder of Bertred are supposed to tie in with *that* idea. Also, the crucial part where she is attacked by Miles in the forest and saved by Niall is left out, and replaced by Miles taking her to the garden when he burns the bush, and almost burning her and himself with it - in this scene he is definitely insane. So the element of cold, calculated crime is entirely absent from the movie, taking with it an important aspect of the story.

So, on the whole, this movie could have been much, much better. I guess I'll go watch a good Cadfael, like the Leper of Saint Giles, now!!! :)",1210204800,,4245,4.349747474747475
7952539,5,B00005RIWZ,"One of the best in Cadfael series and my wife's favorite. An excellent story based in the life long romance between the lord of the manor and his wife. The lord succumbs to a toturous  illness and his wife bequeaths the estate to the Abby at Shewbury. In return for the manor and its lands, the Abby must provide lodging for the wife and a rather special rent.
The rent? Only a rose cut from the rose bush on the manor grounds. However, this isn't just any old rose bush, but rather the one her husband use to cut roses from for his love in life: a remembrance of the great love they shared.
Well this all sounds great deal for the Abby, so what's the problem? Get ""The Rose Rent"" and find out.",1029024000,,694,4.17910447761194
