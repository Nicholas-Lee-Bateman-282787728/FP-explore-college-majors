983655,5,6305150109,"I have IBD and found it impossible to keep up a workout regimin.
However, I was told to be physically active in order to keep stress levels low, so it wouldn't aggravate my symptoms. Yoga seemed to fit the bill. I tried Kathy's tape and absolutely loved it. She narrates everything really well so you don't always have to look at the TV, and she is pleasant to listen to. I felt physically invigorated, mentally refreshed, and limber. After a couple weeks I noticed I was less stressed and because of that my IBD symptoms have noticeably eased. I suggest this video to anyone in similar cirumstances, or to those who are very stressed out. Don't suffer.",1031270400,6,653,4.589743589743589
983656,2,6305150109,"I agree with the previous reviewer in that the background music and ambiance of the DVD are good, but that was pretty much the only redeeming quality I found in this yoga DVD.  I find Kathy Smith's ""basics"" (in general, aerobics and strength training videos included) to be a little too demanding for a beginner.  I think she is too in shape for her own good and can't relate to how hard it is for a real beginner to get started.
My mom bought this DVD as an introduction to yoga, and she said it was really hard.  As a somewhat experienced yoga student, I tried it, and I could totally understand her viewpoint.  I myself found it too slow, and I think she could have made better choices in terms of what postures to demonstrate.  The ones she does perform are kind of awkward, especially if your muscles are not extremely warm (a fact she briefly mentions at the beginning of the DVD).
It's like Kathy Smith can't decide if she wants this to be for relaxation or for a tough workout, and I think that really weakens the whole experience.  Half the time I wanted to close my eyes so I could just focus on my breathing and posture, but then she'd be jumping into a strenuous posture (like warrior pose) without much warning.
If you really want this DVD, I recommend you watch it a few times before you actually do it, and I recommend you turn your air conditioning off before you start.  Otherwise, you will be floundering trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing every second, and your muscles will be too cold to stretch the way she expects you to.",1028505600,11,1563,4.387543252595155
983657,5,6305150109,"This is an amazing tape (if you can get past the first 5 minutes of commercials for her other workout videos!!). I found after 3 sessions, I was able to do some poses on the tape that I couldn't do the first time! I feel so relaxed during and after the workout. Soothing music, not-too-crazy poses, breathing etc. I really like how Kathy does the voiceover....i think she taped her voice while watching the video after she made it. It is really helpful because she is so descriptive that when you are in mid-pose you don't have to look at the video to know what to do next. She constantly reminds you not to overstretch and to breathe correctly. I've been doing it for 2 weeks now and probably in another month I will try the intermediate video. It's not just a workout, it's a way of life. The whole thing takes about 55 minutes, but you can't imagine how good you will feel when it's done....relaxed and centered. FYI, I got the same intense muscle workout doing this yoga tape that I did with the Body-for-Life program.",1023753600,18,1022,4.441489361702128
983658,5,6305150109,"I'm new to yoga
I just picked up this dvd to try the yoga out for the first time.
I don't know how good this dvd is compare to other yoga dvd's since I never tried them, but this one does it for me.
I was gonna try several dvd's out to find one that suits me, but I think I'm gonna stick w/ this one for a while.
It's about 50 minute workout divided into 3 sections.
It's easy to follow except one or two poses that kindda make you sweat.  The narration is also clear and make it easy to understand what you are suppose to do.
It gives you full body stretching workout which you cannot get from jogging or other simple excersises.
You will sleep more comportabley and defintely feel different throughout the day.",1022112000,7,712,4.159420289855072
983659,5,6305150109,"Kathy Smith teaches perfectly in this beginner's level tape which can actually be kept forever.  I still use it, although I now use, among others, her New Yoga and New Yoga Challenge - along with Baron Baptiste's Soul of Strength, Kripalu Dynamic  and so on - but now I use it either on days when I am tired and have the energy to do more than a half hour Kripalu Gentle.
I had gotten Patrical Walden's Beginner tape - yoga journal's yoga practice introduction - but it turned me off rather than on - made everything seem too difficult.  Whereas Kathy makes it seem doable.
I also like it because it is a kind of review of my technique.  It is incredibly relaxing, gives great stretch and tone as well, and the relaxation at the end is fabulous.  She is so mellow here - totally different from the slightly OTT whooper of Latin Rhythms and Timesaver Weights.  Great!",1020988800,5,866,4.449367088607595
983660,5,6305150109,"I just started looking into yoga to expand my fitness program and found this tape extremely valuable. The instruction is clear and concise. It provides a strong grounding in the basics that is needed to progress to other tapes that are suppose to be for ""beginners"" but don't seem to be to a beginner like me. I think you'll find yourself quickly growing out of this tape but good basics building blocks are indispensable.",995760000,13,422,4.716216216216216
983661,3,6305150109,"I was an absolute beginner. I had never done Yoga before, so I thought that this would be a good place to start. However, I was wrong. I found  that the flexibility of Kathy Smith somehow discouraged me. It is a hard  workout and you must do it on a regular basis to actually get any results.  I would think that for a beginners video, it should have been shorter and  not so intense.",967939200,5,384,4.148648648648648
983662,5,6305150109,"I began practicing yoga a few weeks ago and this was the first video I tried; it is still my #1 choice for home yoga workouts.  I felt the results of the workout immediately; after 2 days I saw small, but noticible  improvements in balance and flexibility and I was slightly sore in all the  right places.  After each workout I feel refreshed, calm, and relaxed.  Kathy has a soothing voice that interjects instruction on breathing and  positions at all the perfect times.  It seems like she knows exactly what  you are doing wrong and tells you, making you concentrate on correcting it.  She tells you what should be happening and what you should not be doing.  It is also nice that she states the purpose of each pose is in regard to  the parts of your body that are being exercised.  The easy-to-follow poses  are held for the right amount of time; as soon as you think you can't stay  in the pose any longer, it is over.  After doing the video two times, I was  able to follow simply by listening to Kathy's instruction rather than  looking at the screen.  The workout time (approx. 50 minutes) is also  perfect.  I highly recommend this video for yoga basics, breathing,  stretching, and toning.  I'm 20, but my 14 year old sister and 50 year old  mother are always jumping in to my home yoga workouts; they love this video  too.  Make sure you watch it a couple times before actually participating  and it will be much more rewarding.",958262400,83,1440,4.484496124031008
983827,4,6305150109,"Kathy Smith: New Yoga Basics is fifty-five minutes long and released on DVD in 1995. Granted I am not the fittest person video on earth, I did find this to be an excellent yoga video if you are fit and never done yoga. If you could stand to lose some more weight like me then you might want to wait a little longer. Kathy was great in her instructions and it went at a nice easy pace. You do need a few things for the video: a chair, a strap or belt, a rolled bath towel, a chair, and a couple blankets. Head and wrist bands are optional. I did sweat to this video. The only down side to this video and I am not alone in this (read other people reviews) some of the poses are held a little too long and the video is fifty minutes long. Also Kathy seems to have a lousy sense of direction. When she tells the viewer to go left, she goes right and just the opposite. The video is done in three parts: Floor Poses, Standing Poses, and Guided Relaxation. Below are the exercises\stances\poses in the three parts. Also she does not name every move.

Floor Poses

She starts off with breathing exercises while lying on the floor. Pelvic lift, bridge pose, bent knee twist, lying twist, cat stretching, diamond seat, downward dog, warrior pose, right and left angle pose

Standing Pose

Mountain Pose, chair pose, blowing palm pose, arm extensions, tree pose

Guided Relaxation
Sitting forward bend, modified shoulder stance pose, sitting forward stretch, ends with her lying on her back in a relaxation pose

I would recommend this video to another person. Kathy Smith: New Yoga Basics gets a B+.

I love this DVD, and I'm happy to say that I'm getting fitter and stronger.  Kathy is an excellent instructor, and doesn't speak in a sing-song voice like many do.  I feel fantastic when done practicing, and am proud of myself for getting fitter.  I also have and love Yoga Sculpt, also by Kathy Smith.",1220054400,,452,4.397590361445783
983829,5,6305150109,"This is a very good DVD's for a beginner. This DVD starts lying on the ground with abdominal breathing exercises and then moves on to stretches (knees to chest etc) and then twist (knees to ground etc.)This is bit different than most yoga DVD's start, but I like the change.  The practice starts out with a more relaxed and calm atmosphere.
  Then on to hands and knee poses (Cat-Cow, knees to chest) and then standing.  There are only a few standing poses (high lunge, side-angle, forward bend with a chair, etc) but they are held long enough so you can feel the effect of the pose.
It ends again on the floor with forward bends and relaxation.  Beginners will learn about posture, foot placement, breath work and alignment.  The total workout is about 1 hour and is well cued, expertly demonstrated and has a person to the right who modifies most moves.  You will need a chair, strap, and or wall available to complete the practice.  Very nice",1202774400,2,945,4.583333333333333

983831,5,6305150109,"This is the first yoga video I ever bought, and it's the only one that I keep coming back to!

My only complaint is the length. At 50+ minutes long, the video is too long for me to do the whole thing every day. I tend to do just the floor poses and then I skip to the guided relaxation.

I do feel great afterward. It's a great way to get rid of a headache. I even found that it helped with my carpal tunnel symptoms, which wasn't something I was expecting it to do!",1154476800,7,466,3.8947368421052633
983832,3,6305150109,"I have never done yoga before and I wanted to try it so I read some reviews on this particular DVD and decided to go for it.  It was okay.  I felt that she kind of babbled too much and the poses were held for quite a while.  I didn't exactly find it as relaxing as it probably should have been.

I have only done the video once. I believe in giving things a second chance so I will do that with this video, but I'm not convinced that my star-rating or feelings will change.",1114041600,3,473,3.9473684210526314
983833,5,6305150109,"I had used Kathy Smith's yoga tape years ago and found it easy to use, even for someone as uncoordinated as I am!  So, when looking for a yoga DVD to relax and get toned after chasing my two-year-old son all day, this seemed like a good choice.  I wasn't disappointed.

The instruction is clear and there are frequent reminders how to get into the pose and signs that you may be doing it incorrectly.  I also like Kathy's comments about which poses may be more difficult for beginners.  Helped to remind me it was alright not to be able to do them my first weeks at it.

My only complaint is that the DVD is so long -- about an hour to complete the program.  However, I can also understand an ACCELERATED yoga program kind of defeats the point of learning to relax!

A good DVD for people who want an introduction to yoga or just want to learn to relax after a busy day while getting toned in the process.",1107734400,13,905,4.22093023255814
983834,5,6305150109,This was my first exposure to yoga.  A couple of the poses are challenging but I stuck with it and saw improvement very quickly.  My balance is amazing and I feel great.,1082419200,7,169,4.25
983835,5,6305150109,"I took this DVD out of my Library our of curiousity along with two of Kathy Smiths other Yoga videos.
 While I've been practicing daily for 7 years and have been fortunate to be blessed with a wonderful and gifted teacher (whose classes I wish I could attend daily), I rely heavily on my home practice due to my schedule.
 I find that VHS/DVD's are a really great way to keep a home practice from getting stale and I like to alternate between lots of programs for variety as well as different levels of intensity. Even though I have been doing Yoga for a relatively long time I still enjoy working with ""beginners"" programs on days when I don't want to push really hard but still want a well rounded practice.
 I found this program to be a real joy to practice with and have been pleasently surprised by the two Yoga Programs of Kathy Smith's that I've gotten to practice with so far. In fact I'll be trying out her intermediate DVD tomorrow and from what I've seen so far I have great expectations. In fact I plan on ordering the 3 DVD set.
 I think it's admirable that while Kathy Smith is the featured teacher in this program, she was wise enough to have collaborated  with Rod Stryker (who not only developed the routine but also was a co-producer on the video if I'm not mistaken). Rod is the real deal, he's as reputable a teacher of yoga as one might find anywhere so this program is extremely sound and well structured.
 I feel that Kathy does a great job of leading you through the program, she paces the program well, has clear and concise instruction and is an inspiring model.
 I can see how some might feel there are some poses (particularly those in lunge positions as well as Downward facing dog) that might be a bit too much for a brand new beginner, but if these weren't included the tape would become pretty useless very quickly. The key is just to do what you can and rest when you need to, you will eventually build up strength incrementally.
 Another positive thing about this program is that it is not filled with ""too much"" verbal instruction and therefore maintains a flow which makes it very ""practice friendly"". There are other very good introductory programs out there but often those become hard to practice with because they can get too bogged down with details and therefore are cumbersome to practice with.
 Anyway, I highly recommend this program for beginners or even those more advanced who (like me on this particular morning) want to have a gentle yoga program to practice with to alternate with more intense programs.

Once you've been doing this video for a while and have the poses down, you may want to advance a faster paced yoga video as this one will not be as challenging.
