8441441,4,B004UDQ7TQ,This movie belongs to Ajay Devgan. One of his best performances I have seen and overall the movie was a fair deal. I really did not get bored through out the movie. Full fledged action sequences and some very good emotional scenes. Music could have been better but it was not bad for me. Script was also so much tight. A must watch for Ajay Devgan fans. Raveena Tandon looked so beautiful in this movie,1304467200,,402,4.373333333333333
