8235356,5,B000ZEC7RK,"I'm a big Fist of The North Star fan, and before this box set I had only seen pieces of the whole anime. I own anime movie from the 80's, the horrible live action from the 90's, an complete import for the ""New Fist of The North Star"", and box set I got from an import/video game/anime store which I thought was the complete series but turned out to be the first 30 episodes...
I don't know when this box set will become available again, because when I purchased it in the summer of 2008, it was very few of them left. For the 80 dollar I spent on it, I got a very good deal. The set is 25 if I remember right.
-Fist of The North Star Part 1-2 which is about 150 episodes
-New Fist of The North Star oav 1-3, each episode on a separate disk. Now they could have put this on one disk, because I already own a copy of this OAV on a single DVD. Not a bad thing, just me being nit picky.
-Fist of the North Star Animated movie from 1986. Now the quality of this disk isn't much better than my old copy of the Streamline video version from the 90's. However unlike that version since this in the import collection it only has English subtitles, however it does have an alternate ending from the American version. If you are a true fan, you can get the re-mastered edition on dvd with both English/Japanese voice tracks, however I am not sure if it contains the alternate ending. The only exception are the excellent Fist of The North Star remake movies that started in Japan during 2007. If you get a chance to get these for a good price or see them online, I would suggest you do. Good stuff
-The box art is pretty damn good. It has pages of the manga covering it, and Kenshiro's frame is etched out as you can see. And when you take the slip case off you can great Yuria art. However the little slipcases the DVDs come in are very bootleg looking, reminds me of those cheap cd pockets you use in your car. The art of the DVDs are pretty good.

Only cons I have with this box set are the damn subtitles. I believe this box set must have been made in China, Taiwan or somewhere because it just has this bootleg quality for some reason....lol. I know this seems weird, but the quality of the subtitles are horrible to the point of hilarity. Also they vary from episode to episode. Some episodes they are excellent, some they are horrible, some stuff off good and end up bad. Names are spelled different from sentence to sentence sometimes.
Maybe this can be attributed to the story as well, I noticed a lot of retcon issues throughout the series. However for the most part, the subtitles don't detract too much from the series if you are a hardcore fan. Anything you don't understand you can always look up on fan sites, or wiki.

As far as my actual order I never had any issues with the seller, and I got the complete set with all the stuff I mentioned. If this set ever comes up again for 80$ like when I got it, you guys better get it fast. It was a good buy.",1329350400,,2956,4.175131348511384
8235357,3,B000ZEC7RK,"Only half of the box set was recieved. Contacted the distributor and was told that Amazon did not advertise it properly. Only half of the box set was available for purchase and this was the last set available anywhere. So in order to get the 2nd half of the set, you would have to order the individual DVDs. If that was the case then the set should not have been advertised in the first place.

I am currently in Iraq and sending this order back for a refund would not be a very timely action.

Very disappointed!!",1231632000,3,514,4.288659793814433
