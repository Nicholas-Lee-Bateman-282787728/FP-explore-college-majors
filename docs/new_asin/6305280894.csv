I would give NEGATIVE 1000 stars in rating if I could.  Most of the songs are song by people who would have a hard time getting gigs at Holiday Inn lounges.  The videos themselves have nothing to do with the lyrics of the songs since the director thinks that all of of the songs can be summarized visually as ""bimbos in cheap bikinis (or other forms of revealing clothing bought at K-Mart).  Not that the director could have done much with the actors.  The girls look like strippers at a low-class country strip clubs and have the same level of acting ability.  The guys look like Sears catalogue models who are either semi-nude or are wearing tacky and cheap cloths and they have the same dopey ""I am posing for the underwear shoot"" expression no matter what they are supposed to be doing in the video.  You will be terribly disappointed if you buy these terrible DVDs.",984182400,29,1019,4.411764705882353
7886870,1,6305280894,"At the time of this writing, the Amazon description for this DVD makes you think you are getting recordings by the original artist.  Eg: From the song list: ""Burning Love (Elvis Presley)"".  Presley didn't write it, so surely  Presley is credited because he is the performer?  No- it is sung by an  impersonator.  I don't think Amazon is to blame- they probably just copied  some misleading promotional description from the vendor.
It doesn't hurt  repeating that this karaoke like most others do not have recordings by the  original artists.  Don't get duped by misleading descriptions.  Unless it  explicitly says that the songs are performed by original artists, assume  they aren't.  No songs on this DVD are. It would be nice if Amazon could do  a thorough check of the backs of the boxes of all Karaoke DVDs.  Though  some vendors play semantic games, it doesn't take a rocket scientist or a  playing of the DVD to learn the truth.
I had the misfortune of buying 7  karaoke DVDs, betting that at least one would be useable.  Like the others,  I shall use this for a coaster.  To be fair, this one was the least awful.  It had a bonus DTS track along with the standard track 2 with music only,  and track 3 with music in the left channel and vocals in the right.  Many  of the music tracks are cheesy one man synthesizer and drum machine pieces  you would expect on a low budget production.  If you have a 5.1 system, be  sure to listen for the sonic intricacies on the DTS track.  Quite  sincerely, the vocalists generally gave strong professional performances,  but it's not much of a plus since if you are using it for karaoke you  probably will mute them anyway.
The video transfer and production values  were ok, but this made no difference since the themes of the videos make no  sense whatever.  There is so little thought put into them, that noone would  be able to tell if the songs where mistakenly recorded with the wrong  videos.  For example, ""On the radio"" offered the producers at least an easy  linkage to radio as a theme, but even that was out of their reach.  No  attempt was made to even establish connections  between the scenes.  At  least for continuity sake they kept the actors the same.  We are catapulted  from a scene in a gallery, to the slides at a water park, then inexplicably  to jogging, then to a carriage ride.  With all that variety, you would  think that random chance would produce some relationship to the song, but  the producers couldn't even rely on luck.",952128000,56,2502,4.572727272727272
