8127545,5,B000FWAVU2,"The 1986 Formula One season was one of the best years in modern times, and the official season review video captures all the drama. The year-long battle would bring together such great names as Ayrton Seena, Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg, and three of these drivers (Mansell, Prost and Piquet) remained in the chase for the championship at the final round.

Some Formula One season review videos can be a bit hit-or-miss. The 1983 one is particularly awful and the presentation of the 1985 review is odd to say the least, but the producers made an excellent job on 1986. Formula One fanatic Clive James, who also narrates the 1982 and 1984 videos, provides insightful and often quite humorous commentary. His knowledge of the drivers and teams is very good, especially in the opening guide to the video where each team is introduced, analysed and described. His eulogy over the death of Elio De Angelis during practice in France is fitting, well worded and appropriately brief. As on the 1982 video he handles the tragic aspect of Formula One very well. He also covers the political side of the sport very well in a additional commentary and footage between races. Notable points include the awesome power of Bernie Ecclestone (then the head of the Brabham team), the immense national pressure upon Ferrari, the unique circumstances of the first ever Formula One event to be held in the Eastern Bloc (Hungary) and of course the deals being made on the driver market for the 1987 season.

The tape covers every event on the 1986 Formula One calendar, following the progression of the battle for the world championship as well as mentioning the less monumental changes at the lower end of the field. The various inter-team rivalries are explained in good detail, from the bitter Mansell / Piquet squabble at Williams-Honda, to Prost's domination of Rosberg at McLaren (that lead the Finn to retirement at the end of the season) and Senna's ruthless disregard for Johnny Dumfries at Lotus.

Of course, the tape can only be as exciting and interesting as the season was itself. 1986 provided some highly memorable moments and excellent racing action. Round Two at Jerez, Spain saw the closest finish between two Formula One cars in recent history, as Senna beat Mansell home by 0.014s after a race long battle between the two and Prost. The Mansell-Piquet battle at Brands Hatch was outstanding, as Mansell held off his supposedly superior team mate while driving on colder tyres. The Piquet-Senna battle at Hungary is another memorable moment, as the two scrabble sideways round the first corner desperately trying to pass each other. Then, of course, there is the fateful title decider at Australia where the pack fight among themselves to begin with before Rosberg is sidelined with tyre failure. This is a prelude to one of the most famous sporting images of all time as next Mansell's left rear tyre explodes while pushing 200mph, and the driver wrestles to control the car as it slows down. The moment of explosion, of course, is the moment at which Mansell loses the 1986 title.

Each race is covered in some detail, following the progression of battles for the major positions as well as examining accidents and incidents. Patrick Tambay's alarming barrel-roll at Monaco is especially memorable, as is Gerhard Berger's persistent and extremely mature drive at Mexico to give himself and Benetton their first ever Grand Prix victories. It is also interesting to see shots of Grand Prix tracks long lost, such as the unloved Detroit street circuit and the classic original Austrian Osterreichring before it became the glorified kart track that it is today.

1986 was towards the end of the famous turbo era when Formula One cars were producing massive amounts of horsepower (The 1983 Brabham-BMWs hit over 1400 bhp) and so the racing is generally far more exciting than that which modern F1 fans are accustome d to. If you have seen little more of Formula One than the past few years then I recommend you have a look at this tape to find out exactly how exciting the sport can be.

The footage quality is very good considering the age of the original material. It's not digital-quality, of course, but the FOCA-sources images are extremely good and even include the occasional on-board shots, which were quite rare back in 1986. All the dramatic moments are captured along with some additional footage from practice and qualifying sessions.

Driver interviews cover not just the front-running individuals but also drivers and members from less successful teams, giving useful first0hand insight into the entire Grand Prix world. Mercifully, however, they are not to the irritating extremes of the 1985 video where entire races are commentated on by a single driver.

Indeed I would argue that the 1986 season review video is considerably better in some respects than the modern ones. I feel the commentary style on some more recent videos has become too low on detail, too focused on the front running drivers and often comes across like a news report rather than a race commentary.

The only problem I have with this video is the use of 'sexy' or 'glamorous' footage of women prior to the coverage of the French Grand Prix. It simply looks crude, exploitative and is completely unnecessary. Thankfully there is only one quite brief occurrence.

Aside from that this is an excellent tape, well narrated with excellent footage. What makes it, of course, is the high quality of racing action from the period. Modern F1 simply isn't as exciting as this. I would urge those frustrated by the lack of real action in modern F1, or just bored by the winter lull, to have a look at this. It is highly entertaining.",1148688000,,5737,4.905154639175258
