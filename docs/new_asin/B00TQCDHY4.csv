8702761,4,B00TQCDHY4,"What independent film should be!  A funny and surprising film with Tatum O'Neal and Steven Bauer, in a story about a mayoral election in New Jersey, and all the players have their own little secrets.  Ms. O'Neal hits all the notes for her character as a preacher's wife with a past, and Mr. Bauer certainly gets his chances to chew up the scenery as the challenger in the election.  There are a few clich characters here, but they make this film more fun.  The direction and photography do a great job of capturing backstreet bars in New York, and the contrast of the grit of North Jersey's cities and the beauty of fall colors in suburbia.  At a nice tight run-time of 87 minutes, it's well worth a look.",1442275200,,705,4.434108527131783

8702763,5,B00TQCDHY4,"This was one Pulp Fictionesque film. Though I caught some mistakes, at least it was a huge departure from the formulaic Hollywood nonsense you usually see. I would normally give this 3-3.5 stars, but the overall originality was refreshing.",1432857600,,239,5.153846153846154
