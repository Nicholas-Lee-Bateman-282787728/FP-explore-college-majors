1848994,2,B00008K77J,"Jurassic Park is a good movie in which prehistoric predators are cloned, Ice Age is a good movie with CGI sabertooths. This is why SciFi should never have canceled MST3K. Basically its just another disgrace to horror/monster/scifi movies. The characters are about as bright as slasher victims are, the plot takes stupid twists, the killer animal eats way too many people for it to believably have actually killed. Bloody gory deaths, only a few characters live, the dumb blond scientist who cloned the big mean kitty goes crazy and for some reason thinks her monster will obey her and she is corrected the hard way ,blah, blah, blah blah, ( I also loved how the nerdy guy was freaking out because a cougar showed up and despite all the noise he was making, the cougar was laying down on the ground with what looked for all the world like a relaxed smile on its face)
You get what I'm saying. Besides Diego is a much cooler CGI sabertoothed cat.",1079481600,,944,4.591715976331361
1848995,3,B00008K77J,"SABERTOOTH joins the countless direct to video shockers that would have been better with a bigger budget and a more talented cast.
David Keith, fresh from his non-acting role in DEEP SHOCK, plays an Indiana Jones ripoff great tracker, who delivers his lines as if he were on Ex-lax, and afraid the motion may motivate?  Vanessa Angel should probably take Acting 101 to remember the basics; John Rhys Davies should just be ashamed at himself, and Josh Halloway looks good in tee-shirts, and tries to maintain a sense of character.
The effects on this go from bad to horrendous, but even then, credit is given that the film does have some suspenseful shocking sequences.

A beast of some sort terrorizes and kills a few people, and team set's out to investigate what did the killings, they meet the beast, they run around and scream for 45 minutes and magically defeat the beast at the end, and everyone lives happily ever after.

1849009,4,B00008K77J,"""Hell's bells!  What if it kills someone!?!""
One can only hope.  At any rate, that's the only reason I bought it.  What's the point in having a voracious beast on the loose if it doesn't eat a couple of people, or more?
In this case, the beastie in question is a cloned Sabretooth (part CGI, part animatronic).  The dopey scientist responsible (Vanessa Angel as Catherine Viciy) claims she was doing it as a dress rehearsal for human cloning for organ replacement.  What a prehistoric animal has to do with that is anyone's guess.  All her financial backer (John Rhys-Davies) can see is the possibility for huge profits.  Neither are pleased when the kitty-cat gets loose and chows down on a janitor.  Nor are they pleased when it gets loose during transport, requiring they call in a big game hunter (David Keith) to track and capture it.  Meanwhile, in the same forest the Sabretooth is wandering around in, there just happens to be a small group of junior guides being trained by Josh Holloway (as Trent Parks) & Jenna Gering (as Casey Ballenger).  Naturally, all parties converge at some point.  Some live to tell the tale, most do not.

The plot follows the pattern of most films in this genre.  It does so as well as can be expected.  The novelty here is the appearances of several official actors long in the business: David Keith (An Officer and a Gentleman), John Rhys-Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Victor/Victoria, The Lost World, The Fellowship of the Ring), Josh Holloway (Mission: Impossible--Ghost Protocol, LOST), and Vanessa Angel (King of New York, Kingpin, Baywatch).  The rest remain fodder for the Sabretooth.  It should be noted that the beast looks best as animatronic.  When they indulge in CGI for the long shots, it fails to feel like it's a part of the environment it's terrorizing.  Otherwise, it's about what you'd expect.  It's not great but I liked it.",1409097600,2,1885,4.780185758513932
1849010,5,B00008K77J,"The Smildon was a predator of the North and South American Pleistocene Epoch.

Scy fy makes lots of very low budget movies that I find tolerable and ok but this one is hard to watch.  I disagree about vanessa angel and the rest of the cast , the did a fine job actually with what they had, but the effects for this era are very poor.  If this was a 1980's cgi effort , then you'd say it was fine but this is really poor.

This is the case of ""its so bad, its horrible.""  And I really mean its horrible.  The plot is horrible, the acting sub-par, and the sabertooth would look better if I substituted my fat house cat.  I really mean that.  But, Sabertooth can be fun at times, like when they finally kill the sabertooth.  You'll cheer, but only becasue the movie has ended.",1157414400,,525,4.395833333333333
1849038,1,B00008K77J,"When a greedy scientist and his sexy henchwoman decide to create a genetically enhanced Sabretooth, it (of course), gets loose and wreaks havoc on a group of unsuspecting campers. The inevitable happens- campy carnage, and a struggle for survival between the good guys and the bad guys, with the usual high body count.

The Sabretooth tiger was super cheesy. Mostly computer generated. I do think the CGI artists took some liberties with the sabre. It wouldn't be well adapted for hunting man. It was an ambush predator which couldn't run long distances (just look at its hindlegs), and was meant to crouch in tall bushes and gut the prey from underneath or deliver a piercing blow and wait for death. It would be quite awkward to sabre a standing person because of the angle the cat would have to hold its head. Besides the teeth are actually quite brittle and not intended to suffer extensive side-to-side movement.  Most of the attack in Sabretooth were like that of a bear or lion(hands/paws ripping throgh the door), dragging prey off into the bushes etc. Riddle me how it can do that with big brittle teeth? Its too bad the screenwriter took no opportunity to educate viewers about the animal rather than to just do the obvious and make it similar to just any other large fantasy beast.

1 star. Fun, friday night entertainment, but not rocket science or anywhere close. Much improved by Josh Holloway. Yum.",1150934400,,1413,4.782786885245901
1849039,2,B00008K77J,"I was expecting a lot more from this sci-fi movie, but I guess that was wishful thinking. I found the movie to be below average filled with clice element and generic characters. Throughout the whole film, you probably see the Sabertooth for good 10 min in total (which is not much) and when he actually appear on sceen, he looks totally fake and totally offscale. I was wondering why the Sabertooth's body and teeth so clean, after he has kills tons of people. They could have definitely made the Sabertooth more scary. The acting was kind of cheesy too. The character's dialogs sound like hey're scripted and doesn't comes off unevenly. Also a lot of the logic in movie are unbelieveable. For example: (WARNING contain spoiler)

1) The Sabertooth  bust a hole through a cabin and snatch one of his victem. Keep in mind that the store is still close, there's only a hole in the store in which victem was obviously drag outside by the Sabertooth. Yet the next day, his body was found inside the cabin yet the door was still close. I guess that Sabertooth must somehow leap through the whole in the center of the door, with a body in his mouth.

2). Josh Holloway's (Trent) been cut by the sabertooth, been shot in the arm by a gun, his camper friends all been kill (his fault) and he's been through a terrifying surreal situation, yet he has time to make out by the end because he's the ""hero"" of the flick.  Making out is the last thing on my mind. Kind of cheesy.

3). There are 3 Jr. camper that sign up or were sign up by their parents so they can explore the outdoors and learn leadership skill. Yet these jr camper were kill by the end of the movie, but the movie end happily ever after with the two Head camper heading off into the sunset. Wouldn't the parents of these kids want an explaination on why theirs kids die and if they're going to believe that a Sabertooth Tiger ate them?

I was hoping the ending would be better or something unexpected but it has a typical ending. I would definitely recommend Brotherhood of the Wolf as a better altrenative.",1135209600,,2062,4.441798941798941

Also there is another group of people around the area in which the sabertooth roams around. Bad to the extreme....the pits...this movie has crap written all over it from the word go. My only interest in this movie is actor Josh Holloway (Cold Heart) who plays Trent....Holloway in one of his pre-ABC'S LOST moments....he's bad in this but hey man, he needed the money.

James DR Hickox (Children of the Corn III, Krocodylus) is long overdue to break out on the scene in historical fashion.

1849043,3,B00008K77J,"I've been watching SciFi original pics religiously for a couple of years now.  I've seen ""Sabertooth"" three times.  Many of the reviewers of this movie would probably choke to death if they watched this flick more than once.  The fact is, SciFi makes some pretty shoddy flicks.  Most of them aren't very tolerable, but every once in awhile, a film like ""Sabertooth"" comes along with some reasonably solid actors and a stiff plot that manages to hold my attention long enough to see the end credits roll.

When watching a SciFi original movie like ""Sabertooth,"" you have to understand three things:  a)  The budget for this flick is somewhere near the monthly take-home earnings of a fry cook at a fast-food joint b)  The ""stars"" of the film are usually good actors who've never been in the spotlight but are recognizable and, finally, c)The plot, acting, special effects, music, etc., will be bad, really bad.

With those things understood, you'll see that ""Sabertooth"" is just a tad sharper than most SciFi productions.  The primary cast is excellent(David Keith, John Rhys-Davies, and Vanessa Angel).  Keith has been in a number of really good films, but he's never been a major star in Hollywood.  Rhys-Davies seems to relish cheesy sci-fi, because he's been in a number of SciFi productions, including the upcoming ""Chupacabra"" flick due on the SciFi channel very soon.  He's also played key roles in the ""Indiana Jones"" flicks and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  Angel is probably the least known of the bunch, unless you happened to watch the TV series ""Weird Science.""  The rest of the cast is tolerable, though the kid playing Leon seemed a little bit too gung-ho about playing GI Joe in the woods.  ""I told him to take my knife!"" is one of his better lines.

The music doesn't play much of a role in this flick.  It does attempt to scare up a little suspense at moments, but the cheese-factor outweighs the music in this production.  The cheese comes into effect when the sabertooth pops up on the screen.  He looks fake in CGI and in animatronic form.  As a matter of fact, Diego from ""Ice Age"" would have probably looked more realistic in this film than the big cat that they used.  He isn't scary at all.

But, when comparing ""Sabertooth"" to other current SciFi heaping helpings like ""Frankenfish,"" ""Larva,"" and ""Marabunta,"" you quickly see that it is one of the better movies on the channel.  The story is pretty neat, though not original, and it is a pretty good way to pass a lazy afternoon.  It isn't the best ""B"" movie around, but it suffices.

Recommended to fans of really cheesy ""B"" flicks with some decent action.  If you liked ""Frankenfish,"" you'll probably like this one.  Fans of movies like ""Anaconda"" will probably enjoy this one, too.  If you expect your sci-fi to be some sort of sweeping epic with great effects and breathtaking battles on strange worlds, pass this one up and settle on something reliable like ""The Lord of the Rings-Return of the King.""",1106524800,16,2985,4.73062015503876
1849044,1,B00008K77J,"""Sabretooth"" is yet another entry in the tiresome ""animals gone wild"" genre. You've seen a lot of the other ones already, such as ""Octopus,"" ""Crocodile"" or its many derivatives, and the numerous shark films. Perhaps we should blame Steven Spielberg since it was his film ""Jaws"" that inspired every two-bit hack interested in making a beastie film to go to Hollywood with nothing more than a script, the know-how to work a camera, and a dream. What is startling about ""Sabretooth,"" and various other films in the same vein, has little to do with its mediocrity. Mediocrity and these recent monster films go together like white on rice. Rather, it is the horrific realization that for every film like this one there are ten or more that never cleared the bar. Imagine how terrible the films that didn't see the light of a straight to video release are! Who keeps making these things? I strongly suspect the Sci-Fi Channel bears some of the responsibility. They occasionally show these atrocities in their desperation to fill up airtime. Why? The network can only show so many episodes of the few successful science fiction television programs before the threat of dead air looms large.

An hour and a half of dead air would be vastly preferable to watching ""Sabretooth"" again. The picture starts in a laboratory as we see a janitor wander into a special holding cell containing...well...we aren't supposed to know at this point. Predictably, the door locks and he can't escape before the monster in question (Do you suppose it's a sabretooth?) shreds him into tiny pieces. We don't see the massacre in gory detail, sadly, just a bunch of blood spraying on the glass door. Then the movie switches to a truck driving through the countryside, a truck carrying something in a large cage (Do you suppose it's a sabretooth?) that breaks open when the vehicle just happens to overturn. Something attacks the truck driver (Do you suppose it's a sabretooth?) and then runs off into the woods. Finally, the film lets us in on the identity of the creature by introducing us to Catherine (Vanessa Angel), a busty scientist lacking in the morals department. Thanks to the support offered by billionaire industrialist Anthony (John Rhys-Davies), she plans on winning a Nobel Prize for creating a sabretooth tiger from fossilized DNA. At this exact point word reaches the pair about the animal's escape. Off they go to hire tracker Bob Thatcher (Keith David) to capture the beast alive.

The other plot thread of ""Sabretooth"" involves a group of camp counselors taking a hike through the same forest in which the sabretooth now roams. Led by Casey Ballenger (Jenna Gering), the group consists of another experienced counselor named Trent (Josh Holloway) and three trainees called Leon (Lahmard Tate), Lola (Nicole Tubiola), and Jason (Phillip Glasser). With teeth grinding predictably, we learn that Trent and Casey quibble constantly because they had a relationship that didn't quite work out. The other three characters also provide little in the way of originality: Leon is the token black character, Lola is the scared girl, and Jason is a white hip-hop wannabe and all around goof. Long scenes follow showing us the miseries inherent in hiking through rough terrain, largely consisting of the city slicker trainees complaining about life in the wilderness and bickering with one another. Trent even strikes up a romance with Lola, much to the consternation of Casey. Of course, all this stuff goes out the window once the campers run into the sabretooth tiger. Congratulations are in order if you haven't given up on the film by the time the counselors meet up with Thatcher, Catherine, and Anthony for the final battle with the beast.

""Sabretooth"" is dreadfully boring and inept. The only positives I saw was a single good gore scene and the attractive actresses in the roles of Catherine, Casey, and Lola. Everything else tanks. What Keith David and John Rhys-Davies are doing in this straight to video schlock is a question for the ages. David once starred opposite Richard Gere in ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" and Rhys-Davies appeared in a couple of the ""Indiana Jones"" films. How did they get from there to here? What's worse, one of the no talent hacks in the film actually tosses out an Indiana Jones reference. The same thing happened in ""House of the Dead"" involving Jurgen Prochnow and a ""Das Boot"" comment. Isn't it bad enough these actors stooped to accept a role in these lousy films? Why must the scriptwriters rub it in? The problems don't stop here, though. One need only look at the CGI sabretooth tiger itself to see a massive, unforgivable crime. It's a terrible, cheesy design that looks so fake that you will howl with laughter the first time you see the tiger waltz across the screen. This mediocre effect almost overshadows the ridiculous scenario in which the Leon character attempts to fight the sabretooth with a couple of small knives. You know something is wrong when you start rooting for the monster to win at the end of the film.

I could go on and on with the numerous problems in this film. Fortunately, the DVD spares us the pain of a director's commentary, giving us instead a trailer for ""Sabretooth"" and one for the Angela Bettis horror movie ""May"" as extras. I ought to rethink my policy of watching as many of these creature feature flicks as possible; few of them shoot for originality and most contain no name casts. Even the ones with a few recognizable names, like ""Sabretooth,"" are more embarrassing than anything else. But since I enjoy heaping sarcasm on bad movies, I'll probably keep watching. It's the least I can do.",1104537600,2,5656,4.882414151925078

The campers are a likable bunch of tiger chow.  Some nicely filled out tight T-shirts there, but nothing in the budget for T&A I guess (just one girl in her bra).  They certainly didn't waste any money on special effects, as the CGI sabre tooth looks quite amusing.  He's so badly done that he doesn't even look like he's running on the ground at one point;  they just sort of CGI'd him up in mid air.

The story moves along well, that part was satisfying enough.  It never got boring.  It never got exciting either, but I wasn't really expecting that.  It does have a little bit of suspense.  The one annoying character gets muched in mid-sentence by the sabre tooth, that was fun.

7984867,3,B00008K77J,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2002 and directed by James D.R. Hickox, ""Sabretooth"" chronicles events when a saberetooth cat, cloned via fossilized DNA, is unleashed into the Big Bear Valley wilderness where it preys on vacationers and a group of trainee guides (led by Jenna Gering & Josh Holloway). The two responsible for creating the creature (Vanessa Angel &John Rhys-Davies) hire a great white hunter to capture it (David Keith).

The beginning introduces the main cast and its too goofy for its own good, particularly in regards to the trainee program group. But the story surprisingly gets compelling, despite the goofiness, and theres a great romantic scene between Holloways character and Lola (Nicole Tubiola).

The cast is likable (rounded out by Lahmard J. Tate and Phillip Glasser) and theres a nice assortment of females but, for me, they all lacked genuine sex appeal, except for maybe Steffanie Busey (Kara), who is overlooked because her parts so peripheral. Its a fun flick and the locations are great, but the creature is too cartoony to suspend disbelief when its head or body is clearly shown. They shouldve limited views to quick, partial looks, like they did in the first half.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 30 minutes and was shot in Big Bear Lake area, San Bernardino National Forest, California. WRITERS: Scott Vandiver (concept) & Tom Woosley (script).
