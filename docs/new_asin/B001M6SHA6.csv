3692863,5,B001M6SHA6,This is one of my fav. seasons! 7 and 8 made me love DBZ! I am so excited for them to come out..... And what was with piccolo on the season 7 set?,1230249600,,146,3.4545454545454546
3692864,5,B001M6SHA6,I think This is going to be the best Season In dbz. I will tell people to buy it.,1230163200,,81,3.3157894736842106
3692865,5,B001M6SHA6,this is my favorite season because vegeta goes back to his roots. and fights  kakarot. i love it!!! vegeta is of course my favorite character by far with teen gohan 2nd. anyways i love this season and the epic final explosion by vegeta. even though it didn't kill buu it is an amazing scene. i love this seasons cover art!!! and the only seasons cover art i don't get is 6 and 7. 6 should of had ss gohan and 7 umm goten and trunks would of been kool. piccolo is just random although i do like him. but at least it wasn't great sayiaman omg please. worst couple of episodes. anyways. im so so excited about this season. purchase this as soon as possible!!! well pre-order it.,1228953600,,675,4.2734375
3692866,5,B001M6SHA6,"I am very happy that Funimation is getting these out in a timely fashion. I have all DBZ seasons on old VHS tapes and I'm so happy to be able to get them on nice little DVD sets. Oh and the Marathon feature is great, no more constant interruptions by beginning and ending title themes. The Babadi and Buu sagas are great, hilarious (Babidi and Buu are so odd of a team), and full of action! This is also the first look at SSJ3!! Can't wait to add this set to my collection and throw away another set of bulky cluttering VHS tapes.

Oh and I would like to add that I'm happy that they picked a better cover for this season, I really didn't understand how Piccolo was all that big of a part of the Great Saiyaman/World Tournament sagas. But Majin Vegeta is absolutely perfect for this set.",1228867200,,787,4.246666666666667
3692867,5,B001M6SHA6,"All great fans appreciate that the most memorable sagas of dragonball z are freiza cell and buu, and they are all different enough for you to enjoy them separately without them being too similar, so if you're not sure if to gewt it then and the one after will be essential as they are awesome and also are the end of dragonballz :O",1227744000,,331,4.26984126984127
3692868,5,B001M6SHA6,"I grew up on DBZ from grades six to nine and I remember not being able to wait to watch the next episode every night. Lately I've enjoyed watching these sets and reliving a series that I never thought I'd be able to own with the way they used to release it (3 episodes on individual releases). I'm glad to see they are putting out another set so soon. This season set contains the Babadi and Majin Buu Saga's of DragonBall Z in the following 34 episode's:

220 The Wizard's Curse_____________________237 Final Atonement
221 King of the Demons_____________________238 Evil Lives On
222 Vegeta Attacks________________________239 Find the Dragon Balls
223 Next Up, Goku_________________________240 Revival
224 Battle Supreme________________________241 Global Announcement
225 Eighteen Unmasks______________________242 Learn to Fuse
226 Pay to Win____________________________243 The Z Sword
227 Heart of a Villan________________________244 Race To Capsule Corp
228 The Dark Prince Returns_________________245 Super Saiyan 3?!
229 Vegeta's Pride_________________________246 Buu's Mutiny
230 The Long Awaited Fight_________________247 The Fusion Dance
231 Magic Ball of Buu_______________________248 Goku's Time is Up
232 Buu is Hatched!________________________249 Return to Other World
233 The Losses Begin_______________________250 Out From the Broken Sword
234 The Terror of Mr. Buu__________________251 Gotenks is Born
235 Meal Time______________________________252 Unlikely Friendship
236 The Warrior's Decision_________________253 I Kill No More

Anyone who has bought the previous sets know what to expect and for anyone who hasn't all the boxes are always well done with the discs holding the episodes but not much more than that. The picture and sound is great and it comes with a booklet with brief info on character's (heroes and villains) and summaries of all the episodes. I also want to say that I appreciate that funimationn has made all the sets the same layout so they lineup well on a shelf.

I Hope they release the ninth season earlier than May but who knows, whenever they do we'll get to see the Fusion and Kid Buu sagas finishing up this series on DVD.

I've enjoyed rewatching these episodes that I remember so well despite not having seen them since they originally aired way back at the turn of the millenium. I find myself watching familiar moments and enjoying them in completely new and different ways than I did as a youth. I'm sure many enjoy this season since it's getting us into the final saga's and battles of DragonBall Z but I always found these sagas different for a reason that I'm just now understanding. Other than the thirteen originals that broadcast in the mid-nineties, that I actually remember watching, Dragon Ball hadn't aired in North America so most of us were introduced to DBZ first. I got used to the show being very science fiction oriented with the first few seasons of alien threats, space travel, killer androids and time travel and then came this final run of Majin Buu, which was more about magic and crazy fighting techniques. After having seen the Dragon Ball series in it's entirety now and looking at these episodes I appreciate them more because I understand that Akira Toriyama had simply taken the series back to it's roots for the final sagas. The original Dragon Ball was all about crazy fighting styles and ridiculous moves and it had many elements of magic, for DBZ he had been influenced more by Sci-Fi in an attempt to change up the story but here knowing he was bringing it to an end he must have decided to take it back to the earliest days.

Any fan of DBZ will find these enjoyable, the final face off between Goku and Vegeta, Goten and Trunks learning Fusion, Goku transforming to SS3. I even find Goten and Trunks trying to fight in disguise as an adult and Eighteen fighting Hercule in a melee tournament amusing B stories. I'm glad this will be out in February and can't wait to finish this series with the final two sagas and the ninth boxed set. Thanks.",1227744000,46,4029,5.117021276595745

Important speeches are cut out, almost 6 minutes gone, and that's just one episode we know of. Important footage is edited out for no reason! As a Dragon Ball Z fan I was excited to finally have blu-ray releases, but now to see that they're edited, I'm severely disappointed. Buyer beware. I'm not sure if we're the only ones to face this problem as I've not found any more reviews saying so, but this is my experience with these blu-rays.",1514246400,,548,4.435643564356436

Also has a marathon mode, so you can just plow through every episode on a disk.

3693027,5,B001M6SHA6,"The action-packed Eighth Season of DBZ, finishing up at episode 253. My personal favorite saga of DBZ full of memorable characters and storylines. Some of the best fights happen in the Majin Buu Saga, period.

For casual fans, this is an absolutely perfect buy. If you are a hardcore fan, this is NOT the definitive edition of DBZ. This is the best purchase you can make that isn't $500.

The Blu Rays:

PROS:

- Are saturated a bit more to add a more modern aesthetic.

- Look gorgeous remastered, almost like a painting

- Include worthwhile commentaries

- Include both Japanese and English music and language

CONS:

- A small portion of the top and bottom is cropped to fit modern widescreen tv's

- The saturation might not be as appealing to some

- Good release, but not the definitive edition many hardcore fans long for

If you're looking to buy this for a relative/grandson etc. buy THESE, the Blu Rays, rather than the Orange Bricks. Do NOT waste your money on those. Here's why:

- The orange bricks crop out an incredibly noticeable amount from the top and bottom of the screen

- The remaster job is passable at best, at times very poor

- The colors are incredibly over saturated

I hope this helps. If not, just find the dragonballs.",1436572800,7,1250,4.563063063063063

3693145,5,B001M6SHA6,"This is my favorite season because of the renewed rivalry between Goku and Vegeta. The battle that they had on this season was my second favorite battle in the show, behind Goku and Frieza's fight on Namek. I also like the physcotic personality of Babidi, and the childish acts of Majin Buu. I'm not a big fan of Vegeta's death, even though it was about time he showed some selflessness. This especially sucked because not only did Majin Buu not die from the explosion, but Vegeta did not make an appearance for over two dozen episodes. I like how the Supreme Kai and Babidi have a hatred for each other because Supreme Kai killed Babadi's father, Bibidi millions of years earlier. I'm a big fan of Goku's super saiyan 3 transformation and of how long it to him to fully transform into it. I find it interesting how Hercule(Mr. Satan) and the soon to be good Majin Buu develop a true friendship.",1423958400,,895,4.530864197530864

The use of stale storylines and uneventful enemies makes this season so not worth the $38.00 for a reserve. I think I will be waiting on buying the terrible season 8 and 9 because of the bad pricing. I'll wait until its down in price which is a guarantee to go down,1411344000,4,379,4.507246376811594

3693406,5,B001M6SHA6,"In this season we introduce Babidi and Majin Buu (which carries over to the 9th season). First off, if you order this season be sure to get the 9th one either at the same time or shortly after due to so much is going on with the Buu Saga that you don't want to have to wait long to continue the story.

On the cover is featured Majin Vegeta (he gets possessed later on) and Goku as well as to fight him. I like to call this the 2nd major bout with Vegeta vs Goku. In my opinion, Buu's voice is annoy after a few times hearing it because its high pitched and he talks in 3rd person such as: 'Buu likes you,' or 'Buu wants to eat cookies' to give you an idea what to expect. Buu is pretty much the strongest villian in the Dragon Ball Z series compared to Frieza and Cell (if you combined them both).

Highlights
-Goten and Trunks fuse to make Gotenks (as well as the introduction of SSJ3)
-Gohan obtains the Z Sword
-Kai and Elder Kai (higher than the 4 direction Kais)",1359072000,2,968,4.089473684210526

We get to see the Super Saiyan 3 and Fusion transformations. My favorite feature of this box set is the marathon feature option. This allows you to watch all the episodes on each disc w/o any previews or opening/closing songs. It makes everything flow so much smoother. The video and audio quality is also very good in this collection. It is presented in 5.1 dolby digital. The dialogue has also been revised.

Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.

Season 8 is action packed. It features the long awaited rematch between Vegeta and Goku and Super Saiyan 3! What more could you ask for? A big follow up to the mostly light-hearted season 7. This is one box set that you need regardless of whether or not you own the rest of the series.",1326153600,,562,4.3619047619047615
3693467,3,B001M6SHA6,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Eight box set includes six DVDs that contain thirty-four episodes.  The first four discs contain six episodes, the fifth disc contains five episodes, and the sixth discs contain five episodes and the DVD extras.  The episodes in this set focus on the resurrection of Majin Buu, a very powerful monster that can destroy the world if it isn't stopped.

One of the best features of the Dragon Ball Z sets is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

For special features, this set still includes textless opening and closing songs, which are the same ones that appeared on the Dragon Ball Z Season Seven DVD box set.  On these textless songs, the credit text is gone, but there are still subtitles that appear on the screen.  Also in the extras menu is a link for trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for: Yu Yu Hakusho, One Piece, Project Blue Earth SOS, Kiddy Grade, Utawarerumono, Blue Gender, Case Closed, and Dragon Ball Z.

Like the previous box sets, I have issues with the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's splash screen at the beginning of the discs, the trailer at the start of the disc, and the menu are mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes themselves were mastered at a very soft audio level.  I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features.

If you don't mind the picture and audio quality on your DVDs, then this box set would be worth getting.  However, if you're looking for better quality, you can either get the corresponding Dragon Box, or wait until FUNimation gets to this point in their upcoming Blu-ray remasters.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1317081600,2,2002,4.660968660968661
3693468,5,B001M6SHA6,"After a dissapointing Season 7, this director is back with the best Season yet. This Season has everything you could possibly want from a good action series. But most DBZ fans don't care about that. Most DBZ fans care about how this stands with the other seasons. DBZ has always set the bar for cartoon fighting, crazy intensity, and voice acting, and this season is no exception. This season has more fighting, more crazy techniques, and more evil and powerful villains, than you could ever want. By now you've probably read a bunch of other reviews, so lets skip the technical aspects. But what make this season so great, lets look at some features.

The Good

1) A new powerful villain named Majin Buu.
2) A powerful wizard Babidi that can control people's minds and make them stronger if they're not pure of heart.
3) The long awaited rematch between Goku and Vegeta. (needless to say, this is why I bought the season)
4) Super Saiyan 3!!! (need I say more)
5) The fusion dance! (a tecnique that allows two warriors of similar strength to fuse bodies to create a new and more powerful warrior)
6) American audio!
7) Episode 237 Final Atonement, I will not spoil what happens, but this is unmistakenly the best episode of the entire series. The voice acting, the planning, the upbuilding to the final moment, and the shock and awe of what just happened was perfectly planned and executed!

The Bad

1) After Episode 237, things slid downhill a little, they introduced too many things at once, its like they were trying to stretch the series further than they should.
2) Cropping of the screen made it a little less dramatic (but you hardly notice it, unless you look closely)
3) Majin Buu wasn't near as evil as Cell or Frieza. (however his sporadic nature, does make him a lethal enemy)

If you're a DBZ fan, you must have this season in your library.",1311724800,,1855,4.609090909090909
3693469,2,B001M6SHA6,I love the season but my 5th disc turned out to be from season 7 and not the season that I ordered. I am very up set with this. I'm trying to enjoy the movies just to find out that I'm missing several episodes. I would like yall to send me the disc that I am missing. I have plans to buy more movies as well as books for school from Amazon but now I'm considering to buying them from somewhere else.

Same great crazy power-ups and insanely-powerful baddies to keep you wondering if the heroes will ever pull it out. This set is as good as the others, so if you bought them take the plunge.

 Just one problem I had, as did a couple other members: some dvd players may have trouble playing the disc! I received Season 8, and after watching the other 7 seasons, was ready to dive in with a few friends to raise our power levels. But, the first disc wouldn't get past the menu screen. I ended up sending it back to amazon for replacement but was surprised when the same thing happened with the replacement set. Disc one just seems to have trouble playing on my computer, but my PS3 finally played it. Just be aware that this may happen to you and you may have to figure out a different way to watch Season 8 if your player won't.

Otherwise, this is a can't miss series for young and old martial arts/adventure fans. Would've given it 5 stars if not for the disc problem.",1294876800,,1085,4.388059701492537

After a crazy mishap at the World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku and the gang end up joining forces with the most powerful being in the universe. He is here on a mission to destroy a horrible creature that has been dormant under the Earth for a million years. His name is Majin Buu and although he looks like a big pink ball and acts like an infant, he is heartless and lethal. Goku and his friends will face a force like never before and it's not going to be easy to survive.

This chapter of the DBZ saga is probably the most emotional. It is probably the most well written out of all the sagas in DBZ. This season how ever is not for the faint hearted. The characters while they may be strong, will suffer through a lot of loss due to the death of loved ones. Though it maybe the darkest chapter, there is a lot of new and incredible things to experience. This season gives us the long awaited rematch between Goku and Vegeta. This time they are both super charged and ready to rumble like never before. The creation of Gotenks from the legendary fusion dance is introduced to us as well. Probably the best treat of them all is watching Goku possibly reaching his limits as he powers up to Super Saiyan 3!

Still, with all these incredible new plateaus our heroes have reached, will it still be enough to take down Majin Buu and save the world?! With one season left to go in this legendary show we will soon find out.",1268438400,,1500,4.241258741258742

There are plenty of new concepts for this season, such as bad ass super saiyan three and fusion ( I love Gotenks as well!!). However, by far the most compelling thing in this season  is Vegeta's role in the story. The saiyan prince returns to his evil roots here and the emotion evoked in his scenes are excellent. He truly is my favorite character and that of many other fans' of the long and beloved series. The Goku vs. Vegeta fight may be one of the best in all of DragonBall Z history!!",1249257600,,652,4.3884297520661155

Continuing from where Season Seven(The Great Saiyaman and World Tournament Sagas) left off, Spopovitch and Yamu go to Babidi's Spaceship, with the good guys flying after them, and give Babidi, another one of my favorite villains from the series, the energy that they collected that's being used to revive Babidi's father's, Bibidi's (another of my favorite villains from the series, that doesn't make his debut 'til the flashback in the ""End of Earth"" episode in the final boxset) monster, Majin Buu (another villain that I like), and the good guys eventually learn about this and try to stop Babidi from reviving him. Throughout the sagas, the good guys fight against Babidi's henchmen, Pui Pui, Yakon, and Dabura in his ship in order to get to him and Buu's egg, Majin Buu gets revived and fights against the good guys, Vegeta gets killed by Majin Buu and eventually gets revived, Buu kills Babidi, and Buu meets Hercule and decides to not be evil, leading up to the final boxset where that changes entirely. There are so many new characters that are in the Babidi and Majin Buu sagas, such as Babidi, the worm/rat/roach-like Majin wizard, his father, Bibidi, who was also a Majin wizard, and Majin Buu, the childlike, bubblegum-like monster (all three of their names, Bibidi, Babidi, and Buu, parody/are a reference to the song in ""Disney's"" ""Cinderella""), Dabura the demon king (whose name is a parody/is a reference to abracadabra, a magic-related phrase), Pui-Pui, Babidi's Voon-jin henchman, Yakon, Babidi's dark monster henchman that eats light, and the Supreme Kai, and many others. You get all the episodes from Season Eight (Babidi Saga and Majin Buu Saga combined), such as when Babidi revives Majin Buu, when Majin Buu fights against the good guys, when Majin Buu turns Dabura into a giant cookie and eats him, when Majin Buu kills Vegeta, and the cliffhanger ending to the Majin Buu Saga. The only things that I miss from the boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and the American music Bruce Faulconer made isn't there, but the show is still amazing!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""DRAGON BALL Z"" season eight was aired in Japan during the mid-90's.  For these episodes to be nearly 15 years old, FUNimation did the picture quality some justice by remastering the series.  By working with Video Post & Transfer, they used the original Japanese film masters and transferred them using a Spirit DataCine and passing through a Digital Vision DVNR1000 to remove film grain and then using a Teranex VC6000 video computer for DNR (digital noise reduction) to remove thousands of instances of dirt, scratches and debris.

The video footage signal was then ran through a da Vinci 2K Plus color system to make sure the color is very close to the original Japanese film prints.  After color correction, the final media was then transferred via Sony's HDCAM (high definition digital tape) and created in 1080p HD at 24 frames per second.

So, what we get is a very clean transfer (note: A transfer that would make it even much more cleaner and colorful if presented in Blu-ray) on DVD and the best looking transfer of the episodes in the US thus far.

Audio is presented in three audio tracks.  English voice track with original Japanese music via 5.1 surround, English voice track with TV broadcast music stereo and Japanese voice track with original music and in mono.

As mentioned in my previous reviews, I have watched ""Dragon Ball Z"" when it was first aired in Japan and have rented every episode and have watched it in Japanese.  But until I started reviewing the FUNimation Entertainment box set releases of the series, I have really enjoyed the English dubwork.  I felt the series was well-cast and truthfully, with the original series in mono and hearing it in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, it's hard to go back and listen to the series in mono.

But the great news is that you get the three different audio tracks to suit those with different audio preferences.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

No special features are included but the FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With over 200+ episodes, here we are with the beginning of the final chapter of the ""DRAGON BALL Z"" series and if you thought the Frieza and Cell sagas were fantastic, the Majin Buu saga and where it will go from here is quite amazing.

No villain in ""DRAGON BALL Z"" has looked as cute and nonthreatening as Majin Buu but yet has managed to slaughter a millions of people and really put the Z-Warriors in a position that they have never been in before.

The high points of this season is the fact that you get a long awaited battle between Goku vs. Vegeta, you get the Super Saiyan level 3 transformation of Goku but then we get to see the fusion technique.

Each episode has a very good storyline that it's quite easy to watch episode after episode and find yourself watching a marathon of 2-3 discs because the episodes were quite enjoyable and action-packed.  I also, have to say that there are no filler episodes and each episode, you're going to get hardcore battles and just non-stop action.  It's what you would expect from a series such as ""DRAGON BALL Z"" and nothing less.

Vegeta fans will definitely enjoy his character transformation but most of all his redemption.  The first half is very Vegeta intensive and in Japan, many people wanted more of him and they got it.  So, to see a powerful Vegeta going against Goku was awesome.

The series manages to weave in every character close to the Z-warriors that we have known from the series in this eighth season, which is very cool.  And also, for Hercule/Mr. Satan fans, you will actually get to see him in action as well.

But it's the instability of Majin Buu's character which is quite interesting.  Because of the way this being is made, unlike Frieza and Cell, the ability to continually regenerate, makes him nearly an unstoppable character.  His look and demeanor is nothing like we have seen in the first 200-episodes and to see him kill people for the sake of hunger or for enjoyment to hear things go ""boom"", makes Majin Buu an interesting but moreso, a deadlier villain than any villain that has appeared on ""DRAGON BALL Z"" thus far.

""DRAGON BALL Z"" fans will definitely not be disappointed with this latest box set.  Again, every episode is full of action and also, six discs with 34-episodes all for a great price.  Again, the price of this box set was the nearly the same cost of two or three DBZ DVD's with only two episodes several years ago.  You definitely get your money's worth.

""DRAGON BALL Z - SEASON EIGHT"" is highly recommended for the DBZ fan!",1240876800,14,10266,4.452393760086068
3693530,4,B001M6SHA6,"This season basically summarizes why DBZ had to die. In the end, there were just a little too many similarities to the previous sagas involving Freiza and Cell.

Majin Buu is an unstoppable monster, but then we've all heard this one before. They try to introduce the Fusion technique and some new characters to keep things fresh, but in the end I felt like I was watching the same old stuff from before. It's not as grueling as the Frieza saga was, but it's still a chore to watch through at some stages of the story, where things just drag on and on for what seems like an eternity.

The best part of the saga isn't even Majin Boo, it's Majin Vegeta, and his duel with Goku that I enjoyed more than the actual fight with Majin Boo. That duel is pretty epic, and I wish it would've lasted longer than most of the rest of the story.

Despite this, it's still DBZ and if you love DBZ, you'll still enjoy this on some level, but I kind of wish at this point, brute force wouldn't be applied so heavily and that the villains would differ from each other more.",1240704000,2,1055,4.265
3693531,5,B001M6SHA6,Dragon Ball Z Season 8 was great. Watching the smack down by all of the Z fighters was very exciting and at times intence. Plus seeing Trunks and Gothen as kids working together as one was not only funny but cool to watch they were a pretty tuff team to beat. And seeing Vegete going back to his ruthless bad a** self was Awsome. So to complete this Review. You've got to get this series if you own any of the other series like me. IT'S A MUST MUST MUST!!! Plus inpatiently eger to get Season 9 Now. DragonBall Z RULEZZZ...  Fan For Life David,1240099200,,543,4.171428571428572

3693533,5,B001M6SHA6,"Dragon Ball Z picks up the pace yet again with season 8. This season has some of the best fighting in the entire DBZ series. Some of which I've never seen before, but only heard about when I was growing up trying to wacth this show. I have all 8 seasons and waiting for the 9th and final season to end an excellent series. I kinda get to relive some of my child hood wacthing DBZ all over again and I will keep this collection and someday share them w/my kids if there into this type of show LOL! I would mos def say this is a buy if your into DBZ",1237161600,3,547,3.892857142857143
3693534,5,B001M6SHA6,"I own, all the Dragonball Z Seasons up till now, and I would have to say this one is one of my favorites. Vegeta is my favorite DBZ character and most of this season is him just owning things up! ^_^",1237161600,,199,3.8780487804878048
3693535,5,B001M6SHA6,"I bought the VHS tapes of this saga years ago, and the DVD set outclasses the VHS alternative in every way.

Also, in my opinion, this saga boasts the best art of the entire series, (excluding the late movies.) and is vastly superior the the art of GT.",1236556800,,252,4.25
3693536,5,B001M6SHA6,if u a dbz fan u need to own this boxset handsdown every episode is action packed...from disc 1 to disc 6...,1234742400,2,108,3.9545454545454546
3693537,5,B001M6SHA6,"DBZ continues with an equal (aka super awesome) quality box 8. Visuals remastered - awesome, sound quality - awesome, epic DBZ - check. Buy it you must - right now!",1234656000,,164,4.5
3693538,5,B001M6SHA6,"Okay. This by far the best season of Dragonball Z. And FUNimation did an excellent job at putting this season onto DVD. The opening song for the show on here is absolutely amazing. I love the guitar solos in it, it gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. It blows the original Japanese opening outta here. I always thought the original Japanese music was kinda lame and bland, except the opening song ""Head Cha-la"" in the older seasons..

Anyway. Here we have the very best episodes. And also some epic moments in the history of DBZ. Like when Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 for the first time infront of Buu. I think FUNimation did a good job with that part adding that cool song in the backround. And big thumbs up to the voice actor for Goku, all that screaming must have been tough. Another great part is the episodes with Majin Vegeta. You can see all the pain and torment he went through with trying to be as good as Goku, and how in the end he gave his life.

All in all, this is a must buy for any DBZ fan or for anyone that was a fan of the Majin Buu sagas. It's still almost hard to believe that DBZ came out in America almost over a decade ago, and yet it's still going strong with an extrodinary amount of followers. This show will always be epic and revolutionary. A great, if not the best Anime ever made.",1234483200,,1314,4.231075697211155
