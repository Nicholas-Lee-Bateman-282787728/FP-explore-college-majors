8493636,5,B00662CG9E,"What can I say. Funny funny funny by two actors who get on so well together.  Both seriously understated actors that can play serious parts.  Great entertainment, good supporting parts acted very well, loved it.",1506729600,,211,5.0

8493638,5,B00662CG9E,"I bought this because I had seen ""Christmas Lights"" and thought it was funny, so I took a chance on the series.  It's silly and predictable, but I'm enjoying it very much.  The characters are good together, and I love Robson Green in anything.  Very happy.",1460332800,,256,4.521739130434782

8493640,4,B00662CG9E,"Robson Green is practically a national treasure in the U.K. North American audiences are gradually getting to know his work and one thing is certain: the man is versatile.

TOUCHING EVIL was this reviewers introduction to Greens talents. That fine, intense series was released in North America by Acorn Media and clearly the response was positive. Give us more Robson Green, you could hear the fans crying.

Judging by interviews with Green on Youtube, the man is hilarious in person and it is no wonder that his comedic skills are every bit as competent as his dramatic abilities. This is plainly on display in the box set NORTHERN LIGHTS, which includes two movies and two series, the entire collection of programs featuring Green as Colin Armstrong and the wonderful, equally-gifted actor Mark Benton as his best friend, Howard Scott.

2004  Movie, CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
2006  6 episode series NORTHERN LIGHTS
2007  6 episode series CITY LIGHTS
2008  Movie, CLASH OF THE SANTAS

This charming series, though not without moments of drama, is a marvelously witty examination of lifelong friendship, male one-upmanship, love and the kind of typically adolescent but somehow charming humour that exists between friends who were closer than brothers right from their earliest school days.

This candid examination of male friendship is a breath of fresh air. Colin and Howard are two regular blokes who have wives, kids, jobs, hobbies and a tendency towards petty jealousy in common. The show is brilliantly written and affords everyone in the ensemble cast an opportunity to shine. Aside from some political correctness in one episode that comes across as preachy, the story threads remain believable (though only just, in some cases) and enjoyable.

A 46 minute behind the scenes look at the making of NORTHERN LIGHTS is fun, too. Theres no denying that in the competitive world of DVD marketing, such things as packaging and extras make an impact.

NORTHERN LIGHTS won't change your world, but it will entertain you and keep you wanting more. The final film in the series, CLASH OF THE SANTAS, shows that the show has run its course. While its the weakest of the lot, it still provides time in the company of characters weve grown to love. Youll have a smile on your face (most of the time) and, like the above-quoted Robson Green fans, chances are youll also be thinking give us more Robson Green. And Mark Benton, quite frankly. Hes a fine character actor visible in a number of shows and always gives a powerful performance.

Speaking of Green, it would be nice if Acorn Media would distribute Greens show Soldier, Soldier, in which he and cast mate Jerome Flynn sang the classic song Unchained Melody. Due to the quick thinking of Simon Cowellyes, THAT Simon Cowella record of their singing the song was soon made and became a huge overnight hit in the U.K. and the duo went on to release several albums. (Soldier, Soldier is highly regarded in its own right, however.)

Nice to know theres a treasure trove of good programing still to be discovered. Keep up the good work, Acorn. And thank you for the Closed Captioning.",1397433600,2,3121,4.899430740037951
8493641,5,B00662CG9E,I think this was very good up til City Lights and Clash  of the Santas. I thought the characters were no longer consistent in their behaviors.  The first part is excellent.  I had to force myself to finish City Lights and Clash of the Santas was just awful.,1386460800,,257,4.3125
8493642,5,B00662CG9E,"This is a fantastic, heart-warming comedy-drama starring the perfectly cast and vastly entertaining duo of Robson Green and Mark Benton, who are brilliantly supported by Nicola Stephenson (Margaret in `Brookside') and Sian Reeves (Sydney Henshall in `Cutting It').

A real treat for all those who enjoy such classic slices of TV gold as `Clocking Off' and `Playing the Field' - and a gem for those not yet familiar with them!

Don't suppose there are any plans for a new series?! ... Pleeeeeeease???!!! ;D",1363478400,,505,5.072289156626506
8493643,3,B00662CG9E,I usually love anything Robson Green is in.  I found this series not up to his usual efforts.  The story just didn't interest me.  I found it kind of dull and uninteresting.  Robson Green and the cast did very well with the material they were given but I would not watch it again.  Other people who have seen it have obviously like it very much.  For me it was just so-so.,1359504000,,372,4.169014084507042
8493644,5,B00662CG9E,"2 guys began their one-upmanship fray in school and then never grew up. Their relationship is the key to this comedy duo that takes on family and employment consequences as they remain best buddies but always trying to out-do the other. The comic duo begins with a Christmas special debut/pilot. Their amazing spark developed through 2 seasons, and then ended in a Santa farce. All good, all humorous, plus the additional aspects of drama, suspense, action, and romance through top notch scripts.

All on the DVDs is with SUBTITLES, even the Behind the Scenes Bonus (45 min).
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS: The fun is shot in 2004 Manchester, with Colin (Robson Green-`Reckless' `Reckless the Sequel') and pal Howie (Mark Benton-`Land Girls' `Scoop') the bickering boys in adult bodies, neighbors, and co-workers. They are married to sisters but the harmony is far from perfect. Rivalry to the nth degree. A British Griswald frenzy. Jokes like a `wanking Santa' makes it older youth to adult fare. Christmas Ho-Ho-HORROR that covers 3 years. 70 min.

NORTHERN LIGHTS: 6 episodes (2006) average about 47 minutes each
Episode 1 Annual company dinner/dance divides our 2 pals
2 Almost unemployed together till one finds a taxi job and the other recalled
3 H.S. reunion triggers old times-not the best of times
4 Will coaching the company football team prove Colin management material?
5 Traumatic events of parents force Colin to consider `family'
6 A group fishing trip is a discovery time experience for all. Legend Sam Kelley is guest.

CITY LIGHTS: 6 episodes (2007) that have a unifying crime plot, continual complex relationship (including sex), and all the emotional conflict of 2 couples living too close. There's ample humor throughout. Some really good writing which jumps successfully from suspense to comedy and back--keeping it entertaining in both venues. My favorite series.
1 As our 2 friends become murder witnesses, life gets a bit hot
2 Witness protection & new IDs don't erase the past
3 2 families in one safe house is a recipe for tension & danger
4 One couple drifts farther apart while gangsters close in
5 Staking out a local hotel goes way beyond just proving or disproving an affair
6 Will best pals, 2 marriage, and captured witnesses end ""till death do us part?"" A thrilling, fast action, high conflict season finale.

CLASH OF THE SANTAS: Howard's happens upon a mall Santa gig and then is entered in an international Santa competition. What!? Colin as his elf? Is Santa for real? Will the continuing bosom/pal rivalry conflict with the Lithuanian Santa event? 120 minutes 2008

Col and Howie are an endearing pair of common guys that cause conflicting viewer emotion from cheers to tears with always a return to laughing.",1324684800,12,2736,4.991228070175438
