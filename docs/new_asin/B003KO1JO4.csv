4133979,3,B003KO1JO4,"Terry Le Riche Walters is interviewed about his story of having been in contact with extra terrestrials since he was a small child and was later made into a book My Orion Friends.  As a child he had psychic visions of how other people felt and then when he was a teenager claims to have boarded a spaceship.  I've watched a lot of films about people who claim to have been witnesses of UFOs, on board their ships, in constant contact with other beings, and so forth.  Terry is different than many of them since he isn't afraid and considers them part of his higher, spiritual self.  He doesn't pretend to know it all, only what he knows and has experienced.  What someone else may know or experience may be different.

He feels that his psychic abilities tend to get in the way of his life at times and make it a bit embarrassing.  He often keeps his mouth shut when he sees that someone is ill or about to die since he doesn't want to seem crazy.

Ultimately he talks about the time machine and how people who've used this time machine can choose to be observers or actual participants in the past (or future) but some met with death.  There's actual footage of the time machine.  I'm not sure if it would really work, but the idea of it is interesting nonetheless.",1285027200,,1266,4.371794871794871
4133980,3,B003KO1JO4,"This is an extended interview with Terry Le Riche Walters, who's a personal witness (victim?) of alien abductions.  Walters is incredibly interesting, and although he seems comfortable as a favorite of visitors from Orion, and as a seer and healer, it's not clear whether he considers this more of a blessing or a curse.  Walters patiently answers interviewer Karen Frandsen's questions, but refuses to embellish his experiences.  There's a great deal he doesn't remember or understand, and won't speculate.  Curiously, his aliens have blue eyes and blond hair, but he isn't sure whether that's what they look like or it's ""some kind of trick.""

The time machine of the title is actually shown in footage from the 60s, and Walters claims to have used it, travelling for five hours to other places and times, and particularly remembers being in Italy ""long ago.""  Interestingly, he has the feeling he wasn't visible to the locals, and could only watch, and not participate--sort of a ghost in the room.

If this subject-matter is of interest to you, this DVD is a must, I think.",1283990400,,1077,4.917127071823204

The main part of the film is an interview of Terry Le Richie Walters, being interviewed by Karen Frandsen with a straight face. Terry has written a book or two about his encounters with aliens dating back to childhood. Terry informs us the aliens are from ""Orion"" which made me scratch my head. Orion is a constellation, not a star. The stars in Orion are not near each other but are many light years apart....oh wait. Terry also informs us the stars are closer than we think. So much for geometry. Humans are not from earth, but from other places and adapted to breathe oxygen in spite of DNA sequencing evidence. Aliens, astro projection, time travel and the spiritual world are all linked. Or yes evil pharmaceutical companies fire bombed a home that had an alien healing machine in it.

The highlight of the film is actual footage of a time machine constructed from alien transistor technology using light coming through gem stones...yes the same Bath, England machine use by someone they called ""Maggie Thatcher"" most likely after she became senile. Besides Bath, these time machines exist in the Pyrenees, Sweden, and Russia. No word on the US is handling the alien time machine gap.

The film is of poor quality and was pixilated in places. Terry talks like he is describing a Dr. Who episode.

For pure enjoyment search ""Jessica  Scab, A Crystal child""

3 stars. An average for those who believe and those who don't.

The rest of the film is more interesting as we discover that",1411084800,,1591,4.660714285714286
8398845,4,B003KO1JO4,"The whole premise behind this video is pretty amazing when you stop to think about it.  I'm still not sure if I believe in time travel, but I was entertained and certainly like to see and hear multiple points of view.",1368921600,,217,4.2926829268292686
8398846,5,B003KO1JO4,Whether the idea of a time machine is true or not I found this dvd to be fascinating. I'm sure some will discount this as fiction but sometimes the truth is hard to swallow. History has proven that fact over and my friends.  I try to be as open minded as possible and the jury is still out.,1368835200,,290,4.0
8398847,2,B003KO1JO4,"The focus is on lectures, good but somewhat misrepresented on the cover. You have to really be in the research side to enjoy.",1363478400,,125,4.478260869565218
8398848,5,B003KO1JO4,"Informative Video, I did not know for sure if a Time Machine actually existed. Interesting to watch, the video describes the existance of a Time Machine that was constructed, but I will not let the Cat out of the bag !!  Watch for yourself !!",1345075200,,242,4.377777777777778
8398849,4,B003KO1JO4,"Terry Le Riche Walters tells his stories in a very humbling manner.  Weather you believe in these types of extra terrestrial adventures or not, his stories were very believable and interesting.  I especially found his psychic ability very appealing because it defined him as a person and in my opinion made his stories more believable.  I think any viewer would find this entertaining.",1307059200,,385,5.079365079365079

8398851,3,B003KO1JO4,"An interview with author Terry Le Riche Walters who talks about his personal life experiences with extra-terrestrials--including surgery done outside of this planet--and his psychic abilities. The interviewer has a little trouble following, and the production is low tech, but he's a pretty interesting guy!",1288483200,,307,5.844444444444444
8398852,3,B003KO1JO4,"This documentary, ""The Alien Time Machine: Encounters from another Dimension"" features Terry le Riche Walters, well-known for his extraterrestrial beliefs. It is evident throughout the film that Walters clearly knows how to tell a good story. He discusses his encounters with aliens and his psychic powers quite candidly, which hints at believability. While he seems like a genuine fellow, I couldn't help but see him as a character, albeit an entertaining and enjoyable character. Footage of the time machine mentioned in the title is shown but it's really up to the viewer to decide how much of this film is legitimate and how much is pure entertainment.",1286409600,,656,5.140186915887851
8398853,3,B003KO1JO4,"""The Alien Time Machine: Encounters From Another Dimension"" promises to be a true story. This claim is well intentioned. It is also, however, not entirely proven.

Through the interviews offered from author Terry Le Riche Walters (famed for paranormal observations), ""Alien Time Machine"" provides viewers with a fascinating glimpse into extraterrestrial cultures. Walters details his own experiences with abductions and is highly entertaining--if not the source of much disbelief. His tales will fascinate individuals but will not succeed in swaying opinions. This will be a film to enjoy for its novelty, not its credibility.

""Alien Time Machine"" will still become a favorite of those seeking more than the typical supernatural stories, though. Its quick pace, enthusiastic interviews and clever reenactments will please.",1285718400,,823,5.737704918032787
