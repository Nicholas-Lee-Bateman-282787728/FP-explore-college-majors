1997972,5,B0001GH5RY,"Having seen almost all Ozu films extant,including some of his earliest short silents, I recommend this as one of his supreme accomplishments.  Yes, it is off his regular beaten path.  His first color film and a somewhat overworked plot, but that is not what you go to an Ozu film for. For some reason this is the only one of his films that I never fail to cry at the start of.  I get swept away into another simple and sublime day-to-day world. After seeing it in public once, two women seated behind me said ""What was that all about?""  Just life, just life.",1082592000,13,558,4.336538461538462
1997993,5,B0001GH5RY,"The double feature (both versions, silent and color) were on last night on TCM. I saw part of the silent film one and was distracted. But I was totally enthralled by the color one. I really thought I'd be bored, but I could not take my eyes from this beautiful, beautiful film and its increasingly captivating story.

The other reviewers have synopsized the plot--Kabuki traveling troupe, its leader returned to play in the town where a former lover and his illegitimate son reside, his desire for a ""higher status"" and more conventional life for his son, the way jealousy (of current mistress and lead actress) leads to actions that totally send upheaval, emotional and career, into father/actor's life.

Visually, this is worth the rental or DVD price. The way sets and scenes are set up--really, it's a feast. The details of life in this seaside city--the barber, the whorehouse, the former lover's establishment--where she's seen serving food and warm sake, and watching her prepare the small bottles of sake, her posture, her presentation, has a charm all its own--small and rather quiet pace, in contrast to the ""hammyness"" of the theater and rogueish quality of the male actors and almost heart-breakingly desperate seductiveness of the actresses, mixed in with all sorts of motives and burdens. It's really a strong, strong film and achingly beautiful.

You feel sad, but not hopeless when its done. Life goes on.

I'm so glad I didn't blow this film off, thinking it'd be dreary and dull. Oh, my. It's wonderful!",1326672000,3,1521,4.952941176470588
1997994,5,B0001GH5RY,"Spoiler alert: this review reveals elements of the story.

Ukigusa (floating weeds) is a beautiful and moving film, one of only four that Ozu made in color. It is a remake of the director's 1934 silent film, A Story of Floating Weeds, also included in this release from Criterion.

Komajuro (Ganjiro Nakamura) is the master of an itinerant troupe of actors. They have arrived at a town in northern Japan to stage their kabuki drama. Komajuro is accompanied by his longtime mistress Sumiko (played by Machiko Kyo of Rashomon).

Komajuro's lover from long ago, Oyoshi (Haruko Sugimura) is proprietress of a sakeya in the town, and Komajuro clandestinely visits her and the son he fathered, Kiyoshi (Hiroshi Kawaguchi). Kiyoshi, now a young man, does not know that Komajuro is his father, but thinks he is an uncle.

Sumiko grows suspicious of Komajuro's attachment to the family of his old lover and pries out his secret. In a fit of jealous pique, she plots revenge, with the help of Kayo, a young actress in the troupe (played by Ayako Wakao). Sumiko gives the girl money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi. When she makes advances on Kiyoshi, he is immediately smitten. The two fall in love.

When Komajuro discovers what has happened he flies into a rage, and tries to break up the relationship. Eventually his identity as Kiyoshi's father is exposed.

Meanwhile, things are not going very well for Komajuro's acting company. Attendance at their performances falls off, and one senses that this is a company that is past its prime. With insufficient ticket sales to pay the actors, it becomes clear that the troupe must be disbanded.

At the railway station as they are leaving separately, Komajuro and Sumiko reconnect. They make up and she agrees to help him as he attempts to start over.

Along with this 1959 remake, Criterion has included Ozu's original 1934 silent film A Story of Floating Weeds. The commentary is by Japanese film expert Donald Richie, who brings his profound knowledge of Ozu and Japanese culture to bear. The story is roughly the same (the names of the principals have been changed), though the 1959 version has been fleshed out to two hours compared to 86 minutes for the silent film.

A Story of Floating Weeds (the 1934 version) will interest Japanese film buffs and admirers of Ozu. Most viewers will naturally gravitate to the 1959 film, shot in color when Ozu's genius was at its peak. The earlier work carries the indelible mark of Ozu's minimalist style in its embryonic stages. In Floating Weeds it has been fine-tuned to perfection.

There are riveting performances by Ganjiro Nakamura and Machiko Kyo. Cinematography is by Kazuo Miyagawa (Ugetsu, Sansho the Bailiff, Rashomon). New subtitles by Donald Richie are an improvement over the ones on the old VHS version, where for example yuuwaku, the Japanese word for seduction, is translated as ""vamp."" The commentary for this version is by Roger Ebert who, despite his modest disclaimers, displays a keen insight into Ozu's work. His explanation of ""pillow shots"" (stills marking the transition between scenes in place of fades or dissolves) offers an important key to Ozu's cinematographic style.

Floating Weeds belongs with Ozu's masterpieces Late Spring and Tokyo Story. Donald Richie has called it ""the most physically beautiful of all of Ozu's pictures."" I couldn't agree more. As usual, Criterion has done a masterful job of giving this gem the setting it so richly deserves.",1321315200,,3466,4.958620689655173
1997995,5,B0001GH5RY,"A superb film. Ozu's ""Floating Weeds"" is a classic in the best sense. It ranks with the greatest of the Japanese films. Characterization, direction and filming all combine to tell the very human story in an utterly compelling and unforgettable way.",1253750400,,248,5.073170731707317
1997996,5,B0001GH5RY,"Yasujiro Ozu was perhaps the greatest obsessional filmmaker in history. Thus, it's no surprise that not only did he rework the same themes over and again in his films, but that he also redid earlier films of his own years later, such as 1932's I Was Born But... as 1959's Good Morning. The most famed examples of this trait are 1934's silent black and white A Story Of Floating Weeds (Ukikusa Monogatari), written by Ozu and Tadao Ikeda, and 1959's sound color film, Floating Weeds (Ukigusa), written by Ozu and Kgo Noda. Both films, whose titular metaphor revolves around the lives of itinerant actors, tell basically the same tale, in slightly different ways, with differently named characters. They follow the ups and downs of the leader of a really bad theater troupe, on its last legs (not unlike the characters from Federico Fellini's first film, Variety Lights), who lands in a town and visits an old girlfriend who bore him a son. In both films, the son believes his father is really his uncle, and the major development in the films is how the father's jealous actress girlfriend tries to sabotage things by having a pretty young actress seduce the son, thus recapitulating the father's key moment in life, one the father believes ruined his chance at stardom and happiness.
  If one is thinking that this is the stuff of pure melodrama, it is. But that's true only on the surface. This is where depth and execution of an art come into play. It also abnegates claims that Ozu eschewed plot in his films for melodrama is about nothing if but plot. While it's true he did not strive for A to B to C narratives, and preferred `organic' story growth, the fact is that all his films had plots, and good ones. But they were not plot driven, nor dependent upon the heavyhanded machinations most drama and films rely upon. The difference between having a plot and being plot driven is something most critics seem to not understand. Ozu simply removes the superfluous plot moments and adds contemplative, poetic, and metaphoric shots in their place, what are termed `pillow shots.' The emphasis is thus not on the driving, but the driver, of plot. After all, the tale of a parent who has a long lost child is not fresh, although the way it's told can be.
  As for the films, the earlier one is actually the slightly better film, mostly because it's more concise- clocking in at 86 minutes vs. the two hour remake....In defense of the later film, it has more humor (one character from the troupe claims his name is Toshiro Mifune- the great star of so many Akira Kurosawa films; a nod to Ozu's rival), and the son's reaction to the news about his father seems a bit more mature and realistic than in the earlier film, while the mother seems more resigned to her lover's leaving, rather than being devastated- as in the earlier film....Another plus that the later film has is its use of color and symbolism, which is far more striking. The opening scene contrasts a lighthouse in the background with a foregrounded bottle. It is a stunning visual image, and such phallic symbols abound in the film, as bottles are repeatedly seen, and there is a scene where the local prostitutes tease the male troupe members as they suck on popsicles. We then see the lighthouse from other perspectives over the course of the film. The earlier film is not set at a seaside town, but in a rural area, and the scene of the father and son fishing is superior in the later film, for there is no oddly stylized synchronization of the pair tossing their fishing lines into the river, over and again, as in the 1934 film, and what the duo speak of- their views on the father's approach to acting, is far more cogent than in the silent version, whose major moment is when the father drops his wallet into the running water. The later version also mimetically puts the father and son in the position of the bottle in relation to the lighthouse at the film's opening. What this means, from a phallic perspective, is open to several interpretations. Another major difference between the two films is that the earlier film has more motion in it- literally. It was made before Ozu got caught in his tatami mat point of view mode, and therefore the emotion of the drama is recapitulated better in the earlier, more kinetic, film....Both A Story Of Floating Weeds and Floating Weeds are proof that not all obsessions result in negativity, a thing one might remind oneself of the next time someone speaks ill of that trait. They are also fine examples of what made Yasujiro Ozu a great artist, even if the art in them might fall just a bit shy of overall greatness. Viva obsesin!?",1220745600,,4647,4.635922330097087
1997997,5,B0001GH5RY,"Two versions: must mean Ozu thought it good enough to revisit.

The first (1934) in black and white, is a little harsher in some ways. There's more humor in the lovely cinematically-rich color version. And, ultimately, more pathos. Truly, the '59 re-telling one of my favorites of all time!",1203984000,,290,4.918367346938775
1997998,4,B0001GH5RY,"This is a neat concept: two movies in one box (two DVDs) -- one is the director's own remake of the other. The 1934 silent (!) version called A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS. And the 1959 color-rich version entitled simply FLOATING WEEDS.

I wasn't fond of either film. If you're not familiar with Ozu, he was a Japanese auteur with gentle sensibilities, creating stories that barely emerge out of ordinariness. These two films involve a traveling Kabuki troup who come to a town in which one of them has history. That's all I'll say about the plot.

However, I particularly want to recommend the film commentary by Roger Ebert. It accompanies the newer film FLOATING WEEDS, and it is full of valuable insight into Ozu's movie making techniques as well as his background.

The commentary for the silent film is by Donald Ritchie who seems to speak Japanese and seems to be very knowledgeable about Japanese films and culture.

I gave 3 stars to the films and added another for the commentaries.

1997999,5,B0001GH5RY,"The Criterion dvd does a great job and the transfer looks amazing.  The movie is about a traveling group of actors who arrive in a small seaport town in south of Japan.  The leader of the group Komajuro Arashi goes to visit his ex girlfriend and their son Kiyoshi, however kiyoshi believes Komajuro is his uncle.  The lead actress Sumiko finds out he is visiting his ex and becomes jealous, in order to humiliate him she persuades a young actress in the group  Kayo to seduce his son.
This movie plays like music, the actors are real with real emotions and even though it is in another country at another time anyone could identify with these characters.
The director Yasujiro Ozu has his own unique style unlike that of any movie i've seen.  His camera does not follow the characters, each shot is like a painting that moves and breathes.  Ozu also directed Tokyo story another in Roger Eberts great movie books and also on Time magazine's top 100 of all time, i haven't seen it but i will now and alot more of Ozu's work i'm sure.
A movie like this i really cant even explain why i love it, i just do, it's the type of movie that sticks with you and seeps into your subconcious.  It's like you were there and actively experienced the movie, as if it became one of your own memories.
I'd recommend this movie to anyone that really loves film, not to someone that just watches to pass time or be temporarily entertained with special effects,(which i also enjoy at times) i'm glad i saw and continue to see movies like this in my late twenties if i saw this 10 years ago i wouldn't have got it or appreciated it.",1178064000,4,1611,4.385906040268456
1998000,5,B0001GH5RY,"This two-disc set from Criterion is another marvel - it presents one of Yasujiro Ozu's most beautifully composed color films along with a rarely-seen black & white silent Ozu film on which it was based. The pictures are amazingly sharp and Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography, though carefully restricted by Ozu, is at last restored to its original greatness. Japanese directors used Agfacolor for their first color efforts, and the effects of age have caused them to fade into some surprising shades.

Despite this, one can be confident that one is looking at the very best possible transfer from the very finest print available. What one cannot, however, be confident of is the commentaries on both discs. I am thankful that Criterion is bringing out a new line of no-frills DVDs, including a volume of late Ozu masterpieces. For ""Floating Weeds"", however, Criterion made the unfortunate choice of Roger Ebert to provide a commentary. Since I have no stomach at all for Ebert, I had to pass on the commentary. Disc 2, however, features a quite welcome commentary by the foremost critic of Japanese film, Donald Richie.

I sincerely hope that Criterion uses better judgement in assigning commentaries in future.",1177632000,,1208,5.095959595959596
1998001,5,B0001GH5RY,"""A Story of Floating Weeds"" (1934) was the second Yasujiro Ozu's film I've seen. Like with ""Tokyo Story"", I kept asking myself, why the film that was made so many years ago about the people who lived so far away in the world I don't know much about is so wonderfully engaging? Why was I so drawn to the characters of this human drama? The story is simple: an aging, traveling actor who is the manager of a kabuki troupe returns to a remote village where he secretly meets his former lover and her 19 year old illegitimate son, to whom he is known as ""uncle."" The older man finds happiness in communicating with his son who turned to be a fine young man. His current mistress, filled with jealousy because of his attachment to his secret family, hires a young beautiful girl, the member of a troupe to seduce a boy.

Directed by the great director and humanist with elegant simplicity, genuine interest to his characters and restraint, this moving film is never melodramatic or manipulative.

I liked the music score written specially for the film in 2004. I tried to watch it silent but it would take me more than one viewing to get used to no music score at all.

Seems that Ozu valued the film and thought about it a lot - he himself made a remake in color and sound 25 years later.

""Floating Weeds"" (1959)

I wrote this after I saw my first Ozu's film, ""Tokyo Story"" about a year ago: ""As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision - but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal, simply put, it is for every parent, every son or daughter - for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning. Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film.""

I feel absolutely the same about ""Floating Weeds"". The film is quiet and deceptively simple but its simplicity reminded me the words of Michelangelo Buanorotti. When asked how he created the perfect statues from the shapeless marble lumps, he answered, ""It is very simple, you just cut off all unnecessary pieces"".

Ozu's films are perfect - they touch us with rare warmth, soft enveloping tenderness and power of human emotions not necessarily with striking visual or sound effects.  ""Floating Weeds"" is a beautiful color film and it is the first color Ozu's film for me. The colors are bright and fresh, tender and kind - they match the director's style perfectly. The delightful music by Kojun Saito reminds me of Nina Rota music in Fellini's films - nostalgic, innocent and rhythmic.",1176854400,6,2834,4.478682170542636
1998002,4,B0001GH5RY,"The 1934 version is about 90 minutes, and the 1959, in color, about 2 hours.

A traveling troupe comes to town to show their old-fashioned plays. Times have changed and the scarce audience prooves their tastes have too. However, it's hard for long settled habits to adapt. The company will have to break up eventually. In this scenario hangs another story: the manager of the company takes the opportunity to visit his old mistress, with whom he had a son. But the son, now about to go to college, still thinks the old actor is his uncle on another of his visits. This secret, kept for so long by his parents, is going to be revealed by a trick of fate.

I like the color version better. The cinematography is beautiful, the composition and style is typical of Ozu's films. I think this was his first color film. But, in my opinion, it's too long and too slow. In the b&w version it takes the first 10 minutes just to get a hint at what it is all about. The color version is even slower. It goes increscendo in intensity, but too slow. If it hadn't been such a beautiful film (an Ozu film) I would have given up after half an hour. But it finally pays off to be a little patient.

I find the other 3 great Ozu films (Late Spring, Early Summer & Tokyo Story) much more interesting and better overall, though it may be a minority opinion.",1174694400,2,1336,4.314741035856573
1998013,4,B0001GH5RY,"Ugikusa (Yasujiro Ozu, 1951)

Ozu remade his own 1934 masterpiece, Ugikusa Monogatari, in 1959 as Ugikusa, and it's just as good the second time around. An acting troupe who are quickly fading into obscurity come back to the hometown of their leader, Kimajuro Arashi (Kwaidan's Ganjiro Nakamura). The troupe, already on the verge of breaking up, are plunged into drama as Arashi's present mistress, troupe member Sumiko (Thousand Cranes' Machiko Kyo), finds out about Arashi's previous mistress, townsperson Oyoshi (Hiruko Sugimura, who also worked on Kwaidan). Sumiko's jealousy is inflamed, and the plot moves forward.

Ozu and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa created a visual feast with Ugikusa. Miyagawa was a more than capable replacement for the late Hideo Shigeharas, who'd done the cinematography for the original, and Miyagawa and Ozu use their story-- which is admittedly stock stuff, albeit interesting-- as a frame from which to hang wonderfully arresting scenery. This is an all-out gorgeous film, and whether you end up enjoying the story or not, images from it will stay with you for a long, long time after you've seen it. I found it quite worthwhile, with a stable of interesting characters populating a somewhat predictable story, with the characters ending up being the more important part of the equation. Well worth your time. *** ",1165968000,2,1351,5.274418604651163
1998014,5,B0001GH5RY,"Being an Ozu afficianado, I am particualrly impressed by this collection due to the fact that it includes the 1959 version of Floating Weeds, which is difficult to obtain on DVD. Picture qualities are good, which is essential. Putting together the two versions is a good idea since one could then make comparisions. Ozu talked about cycles and mutabilities :  it is therefore quite apt to revisit the same cycle to see what mutabilities resulted in the space of twenty something years.",1154131200,2,485,4.914634146341464
1998015,5,B0001GH5RY,"FLOATING WEEDS, both the 1934 silent and the colorful 1959 talkie, aren't the type of movie I normally seek out.  Even though I watch a fair number of both silent and foreign movies, I usually lean heavily towards action movies.  Quiet, contemplative, character-driven movies - classic or not - aren't automatically appealing.  To put it another way, I wasn't much interested in watching the story of an itinerant kabuki troupe, an abandoned son and deserted mother.  Classic or not, I didn't care how many recommendation engines pushed these films my way.  Until now I've been pushing back.

 More fool me.  Entranced doesn't begin to describe my reaction to both of them.  And, even though both commentary tracks did an admirable job of breaking down director Yasujiro Ozu's technique and history - Ozu biographer Donald Richie on the silent version, ubiquitous film critic Roger Ebert on the talkie - I can't yet say why I suddenly have two new favorite movies.  As I've learned, thanks to the helpful c-tracks, Ozu was a `simple' director, who simply didn't use a whole lot of the tricks of the trade.  No tracking shots, no panning, the camera is a neutral eye in his hands, about three feet off the ground, catching an artfully framed set for the actors to move about and sometimes hide in.  The story suits the visual style - in both films the acting is understated, the melodramatic potentials not exploited.

 If I had to choose, though, I think I preferred the silent movie.  Ebert mentions (often enough) Ozu's use of color in FLOATING WEEDS, especially the many shades of red.  The screen is indeed vibrant with colors, but I felt that worked a bit against the story.  Ozu, wisely, doesn't stage things so that he'll influence our judgment of his characters or their actions.  The story is open to interpretation, and I interpret as a bit of a tragedy.  The bright colors, for me, clashed somewhat with the mood.  Plus, the silent movie allows the mother to be a little more prominent, and although the acting style is naturalistic enough, the expressions of alternating joy and despair on her face tell us more than any number of spoken words could.  Like Richie asides on his c-track, actors of today could learn a lot from good silent actors.

  It's a false choice, though.  Both of these movies are five star material on their own, and the opportunity to compare both is a joy.  The transfer prints for both are in very good shape - the '34 version having a scratchy stretch or two.  Highest recommendation for this set.",1149984000,4,2537,4.745995423340961
1998016,5,B0001GH5RY,"What a treat to see two masterworks from director Yasujiro Ozu, both telling the same story but separated by 25 years of filmmaking experience. Both are accomplished but in subtly different ways that allow one to appreciate the prodigious skill behind 1934's ""A Story of Floating Weeds"" and then a master's fully realized artistry in 1959's extended color remake, ""Floating Weeds"". The story in both films focuses on an over-the-hill Kabuki actor who brings his troupe to a small town for hopefully a successful run at the local theater. His name is Kihachi in the first movie and Komajuro in the second. It turns out they have landed in the town where his former wife lives, raising their now grown son by herself. The young man believes the actor to be his uncle, and as a family unit, they all bond much to the consternation of his mistress, the leading actress of the troupe. After a fiery confrontation with the actor in a torrential downpour, she exacts revenge by hiring a younger actress to seduce the son. Even though the young couple falls in love, the damage has been done and the actor's dream of his son's future success shattered in a fit of familial rage that leads toward a bittersweet ending.

As he proves with classics such as ""Tokyo Story"" and ""Early Summer"", Ozu makes the most seemingly mundane events seem powerfully defining, and conversely, he enhances dramatic events by insinuating rather than highlighting them. The director minimizes the inherent melodrama by cutting to the core of human emotions. The 1934 silent version has an almost Murnau-like lyricism and often beatific imagery made all the more impressive by Ozu's immaculate sense of composition. Even at this early stage, he almost never moves the camera and has the camera positioned at eye level as if one was sitting on a tatami mat, the same technique he would use throughout his career. What results is a very Japanese aesthetic applied to a story with universal themes. The optional piano accompaniment, composed just for the Criterion release, enhances the drama, though it feels somewhat anachronistic given the Schumann-like, European-sounding rolling interludes. The 1959 remake is Ozu's first color film and incredibly vibrant thanks to the expert cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa, who did similar duties on Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" and Kenji Mizoguchi's ""Ugetsu"". The newer movie is also 33 minutes longer than the 1934 version, which allows Ozu to take his time in building the story and introduce subsidiary characters to give a stronger sense of setting. In comparison, the earlier film feels more emotionally resonant, perhaps because the lack of dialogue makes the actors more expressionistic, but the 1959 version feels more complete in its portrayal of the story, even including some welcome comedy bits. The distinction makes the identical endings yield different emotions in me: sadder with the earlier version and somehow more accepting with the later film.

The acting is superbly understated in both films. In the central role of the theatrical artisan, Takeshi Sakamoto plays Kihachi more sympathetically than the older, more aggressive-looking Ganjiro Nakamura does in the later version as Komajuro. As the dejected mistress, Rieko Yagumo plays Otaka in the 1934 version in an almost Kabuki-like manner with a sinister edge, whereas the legendary Machiko Ky (""Rashomon"") portrays the renamed Sumiko with a sharper fury and more open resignation at the end. Both films contain the classic Ozu scene where the two characters yell vindictively at each other in a rainstorm as they stand under opposing eaves. The wife, Otsune in 1934 and Oyoshi in 1959, is portrayed more emotionally by Chuoko Iida in 1934 and on the stoic side by Haruko Sugimura in 1959 (she was the needy mother in 1951's ""Early Summer"" and the nasty daughter in 1953's ""Tokyo Story""). The same contrast is evident with the son, portrayed more openly by Hideo Mitsui in 1934 (who returned for the 1959 version as a lecherous actor) and with rebellious surliness by Hiroshi Kawaguchi in the later version. Ozu regular Chishu Ryu shows up in a cameo as the theater owner in the 1959 film.

Criterion has done another excellent job in repackaging these films and the transfers are superlative. Commentary tracks are provided with both movies, a very informative one by film historian Donald Richie on the 1934 version and a more effusive one by Roger Ebert for the 1959 version. There is a trailer included with the later film. Viewing both movies is mandatory for any Ozu aficionado, as his subtle mastery is fascinating to see at both junctures in his career, made all the more intriguing by his unwavering aesthetic.",1119657600,4,4701,5.0476190476190474
1998017,5,B0001GH5RY,"I have only really discovered Ozu in the three years or so and in my mid-- life it is like entering a bright new world. I have recently watched Floating Weeds for the second time (having ordered it on video). The first time I thought it an unusual film- though not one of his best. I have now completely revised this opinion and consider it a supreme masterpiece. Ozu astonishes with a quiet directness I find moving , completely absorbing and exhilarating to watch. I realize the theatre troup which comes into the town, contstructs its little Kabuki world and then fades into nothing is a perfect vehicle and symbol for what Ozu is consistently portraying in all his little plays: the transient , troubling beauty of the world . The transient troubling little dramas of human relationships. The imagery in all Ozu's films(but somehow epsecially this one) make me see images as I did in childhood : a turned corner on a side street, a scene of a harbor at dusk, a slightly surprised look on the face of middle-aged woman. Many of these movies were filmed when I was a child but I believe there is more than a kind odd 1950's familiarity. There is a kind of direct , unfettered appeal to sensations it is almost difficult to name. Something immediately
innocent and guileless in ourselves. Something always,already seeing and awake. The more I watch Ozu the more I see this and nowhere more than in this film. I kept chuckling at little, scene after little scene. Tiny little nuanced moments I kept rewinding to see if I'd really seen . Anyone who hasn't seen this film: Don't just watch it once.",1111968000,17,1596,4.603508771929825
1998018,5,B0001GH5RY,"Ozu called himself a ""tofu dealer"" who sold many different kinds of tofu, but never pork cutlets or anything like that.  He was a master of variations on a theme, taking simple stories and telling and re-telling them, each time with a subtle difference, a slight bend in light and tone. In this stunning DVD package, we are treated to two servings of the same tofu, with the flavor variation that comes with ageing.

The older film, 1934's silent masterpiece ""A Story of Floating Weeds"" (""Ukigusa monogatari"") was made by a younger man with a younger man's passion and righteousness, and the more modern update, 1959's ""Floating Weeds"" (""Ukigusa,"") longer and in color, shows the mellowing that comes with age, the greater desire to forgive, as we see the same story unfold in the hands of an older version of the same man.

Like the river weed from which the films take their names, the Kabuki actors in both versions float from town to town, going where the course takes them and leaving behind nothing permanent.  Long ago, however, one piece of ukigusa, the troupe leader Kihachi, betrayed his nature and left behind something of himself, a son.  Now, the course of the river brings Kihachi back to his house of old memories.  He is excited, pleased with his son, and briefly considers abandoning his drifting ways to become a true and settled tree.  But Kihachi does not float alone, and his leaves and roots are entangled with his Kabuki troupe, including his lover who is determined to keep him drifting.

Like all of Ozu's films, the role of the family is the forefront of ""A Story of Floating Weeds/Floating Weeds.""  In these films, the idea of family is hard to define.  Is it the Kabuki troupe, who live, sleep, eat and work together day in and day out, or is it the biological attachment with a son you have rarely met and a woman you never married.  Irregardless of the definition, a breakdown is imminent, and only after the pieces have been scattered can we divine the truth.

Individually, either of these films is a treat, but bound together like they are in this Criterion Collection release the bar is raised even higher.  A masterpiece of DVD craftsmanship to compliment two masterpiece films.  Each film has a commentary track, ""A Story of Floating Weeds"" by Japanese film grandmaster Donald Richie, who also did the subtitles and provides an insert essay, and ""Floating Weeds"" by admitted Japanese film novice Roger Ebert.  Both commentaries are incredibly insightful and add to the level of appreciation for these films.  The new soundtrack for ""A Story of Floating Weeds"" is sublime, although I have never heard the original so I cannot make a comparison.

Hats off to the Criterion Collection!  Now more Ozu, please! Keep them coming, just like this.",1105315200,27,2775,4.794117647058823
1998019,5,B0001GH5RY,"Floating weeds is the first Ozu film I have seen in color - it is very interesting to see how this master of black and white decided to utilize colors in a very striking way. The story is, like most Ozu films, very simple - about daily life - and leads, eventually, to a course of dramatic emotional events surrounding a family. It is not nearly as sad as 'Tokyo Story' but makes you reflect just as much. It is also an interesting comment on acting - on and off the stage - as the father in the film pretends he is an uncle to a son who does not know that this traveling actor - is actually his father - who elected to live a travelling life with an acting group - instead of settling down to raise a family.

This is another great criterion dvd - featuring commentary from Roger Ebert - and a beautiful transfer of the movie - and the earlier 1934 version. Ozu is without a doubt one of my personal favorite movie makers.",1098403200,13,923,4.156424581005586
1998020,5,B0001GH5RY,"Sublime heroism in small gestures and difficult moral decisions infuse Yasujiro Ozu's 1959 masterpiece, FLOATING WEEDS (Criterion).

An aging Kabuki actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his old lover and illegitimate son, an act that enrages the actor's current mistress. In some ways, the story is the flip side of the Prodigal Son parable.  Here, a bad dad returns to save his son from the temptations of the corrupt world.

This great humanistic film transcends the time and place of its story. I especially enjoyed Roger Ebert's highly informed commentary. Highest recommendation.

Note: The loaded double disc also includes the original 1934 silent version of Ozu's film with an extraordinary new score by noted silent film composer Donald Sosin.",1088035200,14,778,5.2
1998021,3,B0001GH5RY,"Although I admire Ozu's style, his 'simple' approach to unfolding human behaviour and relationships, his approach to women in this particular film troubled me.
The women in this film are treated either violently or cavalierly. After the protagonist has slapped his actress/girlfriend around and kicked her out onto the street,  she later practically begs to come back to him.
The protagonist has also fathered a child many years ago with a woman whom he leaves then later revisits, to see his son who is now a young man. He treats this mother of his child sometimes tenderly, sometimes neglectfully, and seemingly plays with her emotions. She takes it all rather submissively.
There is another instance of male violence toward women, regarding a ""loose"" woman who is involved with his son. The protagonist does not treat her very well either.
It is true that the film is beautiful to regard, with lovely cinamatography, and has a slow hypnotic feel to the narrative, but the social/societal treatment of women put me off.",1085529600,20,1021,5.0058823529411764
1998022,5,B0001GH5RY,"If you only buy one Japanese film to add to your DVD collection, let it be an Ozu film and ""Floating Weeds"" is a wonderful place to start. There's really nothing I can say that isn't absolutely praiseworthy about Ozu and this film. It truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
The Criterion Collection DVD is also a masterpiece, giving us both the original silent ""Story of Floating Weeds"" and the 1959 remake ""Floating Weeds"", (both directed by Ozu). The mastering is done well, the sound is great, and the voice-over commentary by famed Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times is a delightful surprise. Ebert humbly acknowledges that there are better Japanese film & culture experts out there, but ""does his best"" to give a very thorough description of Ozu's very unique style. Needless to say, it's one of the better and more informative commentaries I've heard and Mister Ebert is modest.
The story is genuine, sweet, simple, and believable. The characters are solid and have great depth. Ozu keeps the action and emotions to a realistic level without resorting to over-acting in any of his films. They almost don't feel like films in this way, but feel like intrusions into other peoples lives, but politely so.
Many people have speculated as to Ozu's curious method of placing his camera just below the eye-level of his actors onscreen, and I have my own theory. Perhaps Mr Ozu also has the innocence of children in mind, and is trying to see the world unbiasedly and naively like a child might - from the aproximate eye-level of a child viewing the events happening in the same room as he or she? It's an idea anyway. Perhaps also Ozu wants the camera to look up to his characters as if it is respectfully just below them submissively, as if it is bowing to them all in respect? It's difficult to say for certain, but the look is unique in all of film and once it hooks you, you're hooked for life! You have been warned.
After this wonderful classic, I recommend Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" from 1953 (also recently released by the Criterion Collection). Ozu is a great film master and no one could compose a shot like he in all film history. If you haven't, you must see an Ozu film at least once in your lifetime!",1083456000,74,2220,4.580402010050252

8012073,4,B0001GH5RY,"UKIGUSA MONOGATARI (A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS).  Silent But Golden!

Director:  Yasujiro Ozu
1934
DVD
Rating = ****
Film = four (4) stars; intertitles = five (5) stars; restoration = 4.5 stars.  Director Yasujiro Ozu's first time at bat with this story line (he remade the same story--pretty much shot for shot--25 years later).  From dramatic delivery and audience-engaging perspectives, this photoplay is by far his best iteration (the first time is charm; the second just pretty to look at).  Basic film building blocks (script, directing/editing, acting, and cinematography/lighting) are fully exploited and integrated here demonstrating that [when a director so desires] overall a film can be far greater than the sum of its technical components.  And this movie's craftsmanship benefited greatly by being mounted at the peak of (and a bit beyond) the golden years of silent films in Japan (sound came into full bloom in Japan a few years after it occurred in the West).  Acting can often be mesmerizing with performances touching but not crossing too far over into the blatant melodramatic.  Film dynamics and audience interest are also enhance by eschewing long, slow takes and with the actor(s)/actress(es) who are in frame and facing the camera always the ones delivering the lines.  No ""back acting"" in this movie.  But what would become the director's other trademarks are already in play including: static camera placements (the camera seems to be just sitting there waiting for something [anything!] to happen); laundry lines; trains; and ugly overhead power lines.  Opening credits are shot against a burlap backdrop as are all future films from this director.  There are many memorable scenes including one of an actress casually strolling along the top of the curved rail of a train track in 3-4 inch high platform sandals!  Intertitles seem okay (but others who read Japanese symbols better than I may disagree) and are just the right lengths.  Restoration is quite good--the film looks much younger than it really is.  However, all credits and titles exhibit frame jitter, some wear-related artifacts were ignored, and dark (and fade to dark) scenes often show age-related deterioration.  The piano score was especially composed for this DVD, and is excellent.  Highly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

UKIKUSA (FLOATING WEEDS).  Mildly Entertaining Eye Candy.

Director:  Yasujiro Ozu
1959
DVD
Rating = ***
Film = three stars plus; restoration = five stars.  Pictorially, this film is a work of art: static scene by static scene (the camera never moves).  Color cinematography is simply gorgeous .  Set decoration is stunning.  Costumes are eye-popping beautiful.  It is by far the most end-to-end sumptuously mounted film from the ""classical"" period of the Japanese cinema!  The director also leaves out most of his customary trademarks of ugliness (overhead power lines, clothes lines, ungainly mass transient, etc.).  The script has been punched up sufficiently to hold the viewer's attention through patches of dramatic tediousness and outright boredom.  Events are usually well telegraphed in advance so there are few, if any, surprises.  The film is too long.  There is the lingering impression that the director may have had a hard time letting go of his creation and bringing matters to an end.  Acting is first rate (some actors are from the director's excellent de facto repertory company).  Sound is fine and crisply captures Western-accented (Kansai-ben) dialog.  Subtitles seem just right.  The score copies music from the Italian cinema of the era.  Best watched on a large screen to fully appreciate the artistry.  WILLIAM F. FLANIGAN, PhD.",1406419200,2,3678,5.275862068965517
