2896451,4,0714860239,I purchased this DVD already aware of who Motherwell was. Still a great film for any art film collection or artist.,1358035200,3,115,4.523809523809524
2896452,4,0714860239,"Well done,  better than the Joan Mitchell I  liked it as much as ""Artiist on Art"".  I would reccomend it.",1356912000,,105,4.15
2896453,5,0714860239,I ENJOYED THIS FILM VERY MUCH. I HOPE THEY  PRODUCE MANY MORE FILMS ABOUT ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST ARTIST OF THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES!,1306022400,4,131,4.954545454545454
2896454,4,0714860239,This is an interesting overview of Abstract Expressionism in America as well as an insightful glimpse into Motherwell's process.  A worthwhile watch.,1295740800,9,149,5.7727272727272725
2896455,5,0714860239,"This film bleeds the viewer into the very essence of an Abstract Expressionist's world.  Robert Motherwell, a poetic artist, thinker and writer paints and describes the practice of art, a rare and crucial experience for those who are truly listening.",1281571200,23,250,5.25
2896456,5,0714860239,"Robert Motherwell was a leader and perhaps the master of Abstract Expressionist Art
from the late 1940s thru the 70s. He worked in drawing, painting and collage often
mixing the techniques. He was also the main intellectual spokesman for the Abstract
Movement producing a number of papers and books. Watching him work and also talk about it is a real joy for anyone wanting to know about how a master goes about his art-making.
Another fine film about the same era but with many more artists is ""Painters Painting"" which is now available on DVD.",1269820800,,545,4.747368421052632
2896457,5,0714860239,"This video was purchased by me at the Whitney Museum of Art on

a whim, I knew nothing about Robert Motherwell at the time. I was

very happy when I watched it because as soon as I heard him speak

I knew it would be good. Motherwell offers an intimate account of

himself and his entry into the abstract expressionist art movement,

his friendships with his fellow artists from abroad are touching,

he helps them to understand our culture and its laws,

and they in turn teach him to express himself in art!

This is one of the best documentaries on art ever made, the first

hand accounts of the ""Eighteen Iracibles"" and thier exploits

both on the canvas and in the ""Cedar Bar"" and elsewhere will

be interesting and encouraging to modern artists. I highly

recommend this video, worth every moment of your time, no matter

what type of painting you do!",1135987200,2,857,4.522875816993464

8208661,5,0714860239,"The up-close interviews with Motherwell were VERY interesting.  He being a part of the New York Abstract Expressionist school, but being outside of it as well, was an interesting dichotomy.  I will watch this many times over, as I do with the other artists that have documentaries and movies about them from that school.  I wish that someone would do a feature film about the NY School from this period and cover all of them.  Pollock is one of my own influences as are Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, de Kooning (to a lesser extent) , Barrett Newman, and Mark Rothko.",1426550400,6,571,4.68
