2996454,5,B000X1ZPDS,All 3 CD's are great.  one is only an hour but is very good.,1212278400,,60,3.2857142857142856
2996455,1,B000X1ZPDS,"I was very disappointed. You listed this product as made in 2007 and did not list the specific name of each tape. When it arrived I found I had all three tapes from years ago that I bought from you. It is not fair thar you take three old dvds and put a 2007 label on them. I have bought many things from Amazon and this is the first bad thing that has happened to me. You are not reliable.

2996456,1,B000X1ZPDS,"I am a great Andre Rieu fan, and love his DVDs.  In ordering ""The Ultimate Holiday"" I found that this set is only a repackaging of three previously issued DVDs:  Christmas Around the World, Christmas with Andre Rieu, and New Year's in Vienna.  Nothing in the promotions for the DVD set speaks to this fact.  Amazon's unfortunate return policy only allowed a refund of $24.01.  So BUYER BEWARE!! If you already have one or more of the originally issued DVDs, do not order this set.",1197417600,25,480,4.6
2996457,3,B000X1ZPDS,"I love the Christmas Round the World DVD (I have the CD also).  The second Christmas DVD is fine.  However, since the contents of the package are not specified I wound up with the New Year's Eve DVD which I already have.  I could have purchased just the two for a lot less.  I had looked everywhere to see what was included and nothing was mentioned so it was a blind purchase and an expensive one.  Thank goodness I adore Andre no matter what happens.  I now have to figure who to give the New Year CD to.",1197158400,8,506,4.112244897959184
2996458,4,B000X1ZPDS,"Although these DVD's are already old, (at least from 2004 or earlyer), they are worth buying if you don't have them already. Most Andre lovers will already have them though.
As usual Andre and his orchestra give more than their best, and the music is exellent specially on New Year's Eve punch.(Silvester Punsch)
I think that Amazon should tell what is actually in this collection, so that people do not buy something they already own. But if you do buy, and find you already own these DVD's, you can aways make a new fan by passing them on. The more fans the better.",1196726400,17,567,4.514563106796117

8226589,1,B000X1ZPDS,"I was completely shocked when I opened this parcel because I expected it to be a NEW COLLECTION of the great man's work.  Instead I found 3 DVDs which have been previously been released and have been in my collection for months.
I think that when collections such as this are advertised as excusives, they could at least list the contents of the box somewhere in the advertisement.  $50 odd dollars wasted. I have no problem with Andre himself.  I THINK HE IS THE GREATEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC - it is the people who con the public that I am angry with.",1228780800,,557,4.336538461538462
