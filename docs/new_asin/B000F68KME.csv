8177630,4,B000F68KME,"not a good ""digitally remstering"", didn't seem to touch any flaws. if you take the time to remaster then take care of the flaw issues as well.  (kinda like watching a medium/low bugdet vhs movie)

both films were made from old masters (alice suffering the worst). they both have hairs and specs floating around like special effects do on purpose to similate an old film. (though no scratch lines that i noticed). no extra remastering seems to have been done to clear the specs. alice had a few places where the talking sputtered like original went over a splice. the colors faded in and out. both move around a little like the original films sprocket holes were slightly worn.

they are both enjoyable if you ignore the age problems of the master.

neither have captioning so it is good they are dvd ... you can backup to hear what they said again.

treasure box collection movies usually do better than this.

i would have given a 5 but the flaws are too bothering.",1273017600,,966,4.554913294797688
