7842774,3,6303300952,"This restages the classic fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk in contemporary small town America .It is a town where recession is in the air and Jack's single parent mother is having problems meeting the mortgage payment ,and there is a grasping banker waiting in the wings determined -even eager -to foreclose on the mortgage

Enter a dotty academic -played by Margot Kidder in unflattering guise -who has the magic beans which when planted grow into the beanstalk .Kiddrer tries to persuade them to cut the tree down as there are giants at the top and they might well come down and wreak havoc

Jack-naturally climbs the beanstalk where the giants are living in a 50's sitcom America--Nixon is President and the atmosphere id Leave it to Beaver ,with the Munsters as the family unit .And naturally the giant pusues him back to earth

The movie is cheaply made and the special effects are basic .The make up for the giants is well judged- enough to set them apart without frightening the younger audiences,.

Sad to se an actress of Kidder's stature in this kind of thing but for what it is this is okay -if not really for adults",1105488000,4,1128,4.625
