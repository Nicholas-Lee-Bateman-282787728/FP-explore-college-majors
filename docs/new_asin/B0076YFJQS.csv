5058579,5,B0076YFJQS,I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter. She became delirious while reading the back of the case. Her girl friend joined her in looking over the DVD'S information. They both became so giddy I believe they started drooling. After waiting about half an hour for her to come out of her trance and pay some attention to me I finally gave up and left her there alone with her girlfriend to continue to drool over what must of been a life changing experience to now own what she believes to be the most incredible DVD in the universe.,1400284800,,536,4.316831683168317
5058580,1,B0076YFJQS,"cause it's no music just a documentary very sad, that's it, next time write no music included, so people knows what they getting",1388361600,3,128,4.608695652173913
5058581,1,B0076YFJQS,"There are numerous documentaries available about Lady Gaga, several of them quite interesting. She's an extremely interesting person and quite a unique character, which should make it easy to create something unique and interesting about her. Other have done so, but this, this is the most kindergarten 'ET' type trash, and I want my hour back from Maureen Goldthorpe.

Except for the occasional  addition, the cast throughout is the same three, annoying British publicists (because we don't have any here in Lady Gaga's native USA, much less in NYC, right?). They go on and on, sounding like they are quoting what they learned watching other documentaries and from reading junk 'ET' type rags. The only thing as annoying as these three is the narration.  The only thing more annoying than the content is having to listen to Dan Wootton's annoying British accent. He's the kind of 'sycophant to the stars' that fills intelligent people with disdain towards show business and 'stars'. The sound of him speaking makes me want to brick my HTS.

Enjoy Lady Gaga, and enjoy learning about what a unique persona she's grown into, but you will NOT learn about her here. You'll simply get bombarded with trash hype. This is the kind of work that the industry should be embarrassed by. I love watching Lady Gaga for any number of reasons, but you couldn't pay me to watch this again.",1343520000,6,1374,4.858974358974359
5058582,5,B0076YFJQS,"I learned a lot about the early years of Gaga's life from this documentary. Kind of explains why she is the way she is. But you can't take it away from her that she is a unique person, not afraid to stand up for what she believes in, and works harder than anyone else in the business. Contains great interview footage with Gaga, amazing insights from people like Michael Bolton as well as archival images from her past. I recommend all Gaga's little monsters see it!",1336435200,2,466,4.430232558139535
5058583,5,B0076YFJQS,"Clair & Tait deliver again an artists castle canvas to the hardest working GaGa in show business since James Brown. Bitty-G hovers in and out of storytelling in six inch heals with such youthful exuberance that would make even Darth Vader envious.

In a today's generation, Constantly multitasking updating way,the creative well seems to have no bottom like she has picked up right where Michel Jackson left off.",1335398400,3,412,5.0588235294117645

5058607,1,B0076YFJQS,"that was a terrible documentary about a person there is a lot to say about.  They just constantly talked about how famous she is not how is achieved it, her hardships or the people that helped her to get there.  This woman was the first person to ever get a diamond record and there is no mention of that!  Super disappointed in the makers of this film",1473033600,,352,4.223880597014926

5058623,4,B0076YFJQS,"FULL DISCLOSURE:  I have never been a fan of Lady Gaga.

But, the only reason I'm docking this documentary one star is the word ""secret"" in the title.  I doubt that there was anything secret included in this footage.  That said, this documentary is an excellent, coherent compilation of footage, photos, and interviews regarding this international celebrity, from age four through the peak of her entertainment career.  It includes interviews with Michael Bolton and Nadir ""RedOne"" Al-Khayat It obviously took a lot of work and networking to gather and compile all of this data in order to make such a professional final product.",1469491200,,629,5.067961165048544

5058630,4,B0076YFJQS,It was a good history of Gaga presented well. Not a lot of music clips from performances but that's available elsewhere so it's ok.,1463184000,,131,4.5

8511232,2,B0076YFJQS,"Several facts were completely off. I know this docu isn't supposed to be that wonderfully produced but, for an artist as great and complex as she is, these producers did very shallow digging into what she was all about. It was more of a wiki-summary of her life with the same pictures over and over rather than the ""secret world"" and true person they claimed to unfold.",1484611200,,369,4.522388059701493
