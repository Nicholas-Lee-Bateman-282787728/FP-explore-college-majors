2319383,5,B0009UC6M6,"Well, one day, when I was watching G4TV (Anime Unleashed), I came across this Anime; I watched a few episodes, but it really didn't appeal to me much... Quite a few months, even a year or so later, it starting showing again, so, I said I'd give it another try, and so I did... Fell right in love with it right then. Has a Cowboy Bebop (my absolute favorite Anime) Storyline to it, from then on out, I watched it every night 'til it ended, and the ending was so good, and so very touching; very sad, though. And so, I waited a month or so for the English Dubbed Import to come out, and I bought that (even though they only put 20 episodes on it, and said they would release the last DVD with the last 6 episodes on it next month [August] or so), so, I'd say that everyone should buy the MI Import, especially since you save about $100 or more, and it's a direct rip from the R1 DVDs, with the exact same video quality, and everything else. At least give the Series a 6 or so episode benifit of the doubt, it's absolutely worth it. All should know it's from the makers of Trigun, as well, and without saying, you should already know that Trigun is one of the best Anime Series', and though Gungrave isn't quite as good, it's pretty close. Just try it out on G4TV first, if it's still on there, which I believe it is. A warning, though: this Series is about the Mafia, and therefore, it's definitely not suited for children; plenty of bloody scenes, and it's just oriented for mature audiences; we're talking 17-18+ (Graphic Violence, Gore, Profanity, and Adult Complex Themes). Just a little warning. This shall conclude my review, 'cause, I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to spoil the Series for ya. Hope you all give it a try.",1122163200,5,1727,4.34984520123839
2319384,5,B0009UC6M6,"I was looking for a new anime series to watch and stumbled upon Gungrave after reading good reviews. Little did I know I was going to enjoy one of the best series. I have seen quite a lot and some of my favorites are: Evangelion, Trigun, Hellsing, Cowboy Bebop, Full Metal Alchemist, Berserk... Now I have to update this list and include Gungrave. This series has probably one of the best scenario, the characters feel authentic, the drawing and artwork is excellent. I believe some of the team members who made Trigun worked on this title, so we can see similaritudes in the artistic style. However the tone is completely different, it is not goofy and funny like Trigun but very serious and tense, reminiscent of the movie The Godfather. Themes like duty, honor, loyalty, vengence and love are depicted powerfully. I am not the kind of person to cry or get emotional in movies, but this series has many very touching and powerful moments which gave me a knot. I personnaly think there are some anthologic scenes masterfully combing symbolic elements. Needless to say, I highly recommend watching this series and I think there is a potential for making a very entertaining movie out this.",1120867200,9,1189,4.776699029126213
2319395,5,B0009UC6M6,"This show -- all 26 episodes -- was beautifully written, acted and directed.  Of special note was the role of Brandon Heat, superbly voiced by Kirk Thornton (aka Ron Allen).  His consistent low-key delivery and grasp of the character's intentions both served the character and the production very well indeed.  Also deserving special mention is Michael McConnohie voicing the role of Big Daddy.  A veteran voice actor, McConnohie was virtually perfect as a character of tremendous complexity.  Congrats to
BangZoom Entertainment and Eric Sherman (director and co- producer) on a job well done!  Sincerely, Tom Weiner",1462406400,,616,5.364583333333333

2319397,3,B0009UC6M6,"After reading a lot of reviews about this series I had high hopes..... Not very satisfied... I don't really understand the overwhelming popularity of this series. The real problem I had with this series, which for me is actually a huge issue, is the main protagonist. Brandon rarely if ever speaks (even before he gets wacked). This leads to a lack of character development from the perspective that the only time you feel any kind of connection to him is through the narratives that pop up every now and then trying to force feed you little tidbits of insight. This doesn't really help the plot or move the story along, and at some point you want to be able to empathize with the character and his motivations. Now, I'm not saying this is a horrible series because it isn't. But when you get right down to it, this series could have been compressed into a two hour movie and it would have served the same purpose. Even though the story moves along through a back story, it is a little contrived, and the plot line doesn't really move at a pace that keeps your interest. This is just my opinion, But I like my anime to have a captivating story line regardless of the genre. This could have been accomplished, had Brandon not seemed brain dead even before he was actually ""Brain Dead'. What I mean is that, if I had felt some sort of loss by his death, then I could back him in his revenge. In the end I looked at Brandon as just a dead gangster who got betrayed. As they say, ""So what, Life's a B***h and then.... You die"".... In the end, I wasn't disgusted, but I wasn't satisfied either. Take it for what you will....",1454544000,,1619,4.382059800664452

Where as many anime's take time to hit their stride and slow their pace at time, once Gungrave hits the 2nd or 3rd episode you will be addicted, GUARANTEED! Two characters, Brandon Heat and Harry McDowell. Two street hustlers who slowly rise through the mafia ranks to become top dogs. One is silent but deadly and one is loud, cocky and ambitious. Together they make the best team. But one wants more power and will not stop until he gets it, the other is more cautious and more humble. Best friends slowly become mortal enemies and we are treated to a great drama!",1426809600,,683,4.516129032258065

2319464,5,B0009UC6M6,"This is by far my favorite Anime television series and will remain so for quite some time. The emotion and story telling in this series so deep that I can't help but hope that it influences my own writing someday for a television series/comic book/etc. Brandon Heat's narrative insight, Harry's ambitious rise to power, a romance doomed to never happen, and the great mixture of science-fiction with mafia noir similar to the ""The Godfather"" or a Scorcese film is just excellent.

Fans of Anime will be a fan of how Madhouse Studios created yet another masterpiece. The animation of the show is solid for its time, having been made in the early 2000s decade. The progression of Gungrave's tale is well-paced and leaves you on the edge of your seat until the end. Characters are smoothly introduced, there's enough focus on each person involved to help with making personal connections, and soon your heart is fully involved in the drama, action, and intrigue.

I hardly have any criticisms to make. Saying Gungrave is perfect would be blatant bias, but I have a hard time arguing any flaws in order to be fully objective. To anyone who reads, please take the time to view it wherever it is available, be it on Netflix or through the DVD boxset. Either way, this show is worth every penny.",1391817600,4,1288,4.72
2319465,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave opens thirteen years after Brandon Heat is betrayed and killed by his best friend Harry MacDowell. He is reborn through the use of necro-rise as Beyond The Grave, and begins a quest of revenge against the crime syndicate. The series then backtracks to Brandon's youth, and follows him and Harry as they rise through the criminal underworld, detailing the circumstances that led to their eventual falling-out.

In terms of the discs, the supernatural stuff doesn't start til about half-way through Disc 2. At first, when the story backtracked, I got annoyed that b/c was eager for more of the crazy stuff, but it all makes sense to see the rise to how it all started. I can see why it all works out this way b/c there is so much you need to know, so you can know the characters deeply and understand the story more clearly, otherwise you wouldn't be able to put yourself in Brandon Heats shoes to know exactly how he feels and what he went through. Definitely recommend this anime for those who enjoys such movies as The Godfather, Scarface and The Crow, and the Top Cow video games/comic series to ""The Darkness"".",1390780800,,1122,4.666666666666667

2319490,5,B0009UC6M6,It's a story about a guy who is good with guns. He gets betrayed by his friend and is killed. This is where the story grows. He comes back from the dead. Big badder and out for vengeance. Great story and awesome action.,1377561600,,219,4.116279069767442
2319491,1,B0009UC6M6,"Butt hurt fans, prepare yourselves.

 Anyone who thinks this a great story wouldn't know plot if it kicked them in the butt. One dimensional characters, who do exactly what you expect them to. Unrealistic storyline as well... why the heck did Brandon and Harry just so easily get accepted into the family? And for Brandon to have such strong bonds with Harry and ""Big Daddy"" (THAT NAME! OMG, TRY HARDER!! ORIGINALITY, PLEASE!), there should have been more... bonding for them to have gotten to that point! It also really pissed me off how Brandon never spoke-- there's introverted, and then there's just brain-dead. Him not speaking definitely DID NOT add any sort of depth to the show! If anything, all it did was make everyone talking to seem like a mind reading moron or some shmuck sitting there talking to themselves!!

The Eng Dub was laughable... for example, all of his friends who died... they were supposed to be tough hoodlums in a dump city-- why did they all sound like sissies?? And pretty boy chef? He didn't even look like he belonged in the story at all! Remember when Harry got beat up with his friends in the gutter? ""Hurts like a son-of-a-b**ch""?? WHO says that?? It's ""HURTS LIKE A B***H"", moron! And they were supposed to be tough punks! Why were they crying like little boys after that fight?? -""What are we gonna do HARRY! What are we gonna do HARRY!?""- Cry me a river.

I also could not understand the reason why everyone on the show needed to die. People think it makes anime ""more deep"" and ""meaningful""- but when every character dies, it doesn't add to the show, but takes away from it-- everyone is as important as a gnat. I'm so sick of immature tweens thinking an anime where everyone dies somehow makes them mature and deep... zook people, unless your still in middle school, you shouldn't equate a million dead characters with maturity, OR- a good storyline!

You don't care about any of the characters. Brandon is a brain dead robot and Harry is an old fart that kills everyone. Who cares who wins in the end??

okay, I'm done with this rant... I know it's just a slew of words thrown together in one big bunch, but it needed to be said...",1377129600,8,2173,4.573264781491003
2319492,1,B0009UC6M6,"This was a total waste of time and money. Brandon Heat never had a will of his own, Harry Mcdowel use this sheep like quality to his own advantage.

Brandon, the main character is murdered by his partner, Harry, and returns from the grave to take revenge and set things right again. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell. There a lot of really awesome characters and fight scenes in this anime. There is also enough drama and character development to keep you wanting more.

The animation and voice acting are pretty good. You should recognize many of these voice actors. Overall this is a really good anime. Especially for one based on a video game. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1350172800,2,675,4.625

The story was alright. I personally felt that if they got rid of the genetically engineered monsters and stuck with the gangster theme of it this anime would have been a whole lot better.,1342742400,2,366,4.242857142857143

My main problem is that when I buy a BluRay, I expect it to be the highest quality possible.  If so, why is this in 1080i???  Admittedly, it is a remaster of a standard definition series, but why skimp and interlace the picture when you've gone through the trouble of remastering it?",1327968000,6,510,4.696629213483146

It tells the struggles Harry and Brandon have while moving through the ranks of the ""Family"". It tells a huge tale of how Brandon was Betrayed, How Brandon was ""Brought back to life"" and now seeks revenge on those who betrayed him meanwhile attempting to ""Protect"" his past.

This anime was done very well and the story all the way up to the exciting ending was great.

Warning Due to language and Violance this is not for kids.

If you enjoy a great crime story with ait of a sci-fi twist then you will enjoy this I strongly recomend this.",1312588800,10,864,4.443037974683544
2319527,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave tells the tale of two best friends put on the path of their own destruction. Brandon Heat and Harry McDowell are two street thugs who join with the Mellenion Syndicate (a mafia crime syndicate) and begin the climb the ladder, and their ascension makes a mark on everyone around them.

Gungrave is a noir story with an anime twist. It deals with the internal politics of the mob, but also the deeply rooted bond between Harry and Brandon, unrequited love, and honor. Millenion has an unbreakable law, ""Protect, and never betray the family."" The ""Code of Iron,"" as it's called, drives the entire series.

The first half of the series focuses on Brandon's memories of the time before he ""died."" The ""anime twist"" are the horrors that unchecked ambition created, that Brandon must fight in the second half of the series. Despite being centered around organized crime, the violence doesn't feel gratuitous, there is no drug use, and matters of love (of any kind) are relatively tame.

This is a repackaging of the old DVDs released originally by Geneon, it just comes in a much cooler looking box than the previous box set.

When it comes to anime for guys, in my opinion, there are three series all guys should watch: Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Gungrave. If you liked Trigun and Cowboy Bebop give this a shot.

Just like before, I advise skipping the first episode and starting with Episode 2, it's less confusing that way.",1310342400,29,1427,4.761133603238866

Many things but it mostly deals with the Mafia. In this Case we see what has happened to Brandon Heat and all the commitment he has been with the mafia(Name of Organization escapes me)and what He and his friend Harry do to get to the top and that is when things go haywire. Its a revenge story told threw his take on his life and we get to see what they both do to get this far to the top.  They start small and over the years working for them they climb the ladder and more opportunities pop up throw the years. There are many twist and turns  in this set. If you like d Afro Samurai then you'll like this casue it's like the western version of it. (My point of view).
IF YOU LIKE GUNS,SCIENCE TESTING,REVENGE,GANGS,ETC. THEN YOU WOULD PROBABLY LIKE IT. I know I did and I enjoyed every minute of it. There is a little romance in it to keep the story fresh which is great. There are some CRAZY things that go on as well to keep it fresh.
NOW WHEN I WAS WATCHING IT I SAW BRANDON ACTUALLY DEVELOP INTO THE PERSON WHO HE IS THROW OUT THE ENTIRE SERIES. THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA FOR SEVERAL CHARACTERS TO BROUGHT LIFE TO THE SCREEN WHICH WAS AMAZING. 5/5 STARS.",1308960000,5,1292,4.102766798418973

This is one of the few anime series that actually gets it right. You really attach yourself to these characters and invest in their time on the screen. The characters in this amine share a lot of depth and development that comes from someone passionate about their work. Of course without a story the characters are nothing. The story in this anime is great. I won't spoil the story but as an avid watcher I can say that this anime is a classic and will remain one of my favorites.",1288656000,,748,4.427536231884058

The writer appears to have gotten caught up in wanting to write a tragedy, instead of completing the circle of the story. This shows that the underworld is an evil place and, almost, no one can be saved. Where is the hope? Where is the love?",1287792000,,455,4.241379310344827

There are simple themes throughout such as ""do not betray"" and ""protect"" that seem to define the main character. Brandon Heat is that guy who will stop at nothing to protect what gives meaning to him. Harry MacDowell has a different view of the world that leads to their friendship transforming into a hostile enmity.

Overall, very well done show with a great soundtrack by Tsuneo Imahori. The final conflict between ""Bloody Harry"" and ""Beyond the Grave"" is especially satisfying.",1286841600,,633,5.0285714285714285

2319553,4,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave is one of the best anime stories I've seen: an almost classically structured tragedy of the erosion of a friendship set against a dark world.  It suffers a little from its video game roots in having a series of often implausible fight scenes that suggest racking up points.  But the fantastic development of the characters' lives and relationships over many years more than makes up for this.  The first episode is skippable.  It is mostly repeated later in the series anyway.  The ending is perfect; it is a work of genius.

I do have one complaint about this official release as opposed to the fan sub I first viewed.  There is a (very important) scene in which Harry and Brandon are spending the day together, trying in vain to regain their old sense of friendship.  This scene is marked by a heavy silence: two old friends who no longer who what to say to each other.  In the version I first saw, the silence was taut.  In this release, it has been bulldozed by some strange elevator music.  That was not a good dramatic choice, and it's a shame that it makes this official release somewhat inferior to the fan sub.  Still, to support this excellent anime, it is well worth buying the DVDs.",1283385600,2,1203,4.544186046511628
2319554,5,B0009UC6M6,"This series is in my top five favorite anime series. I bought this series on a whim and did not regret it at all. I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first started watching this series, but in the end I was left with a smile on my face. This series really demonstrates relationships of people and how they can quickly turn sour.

The series starts out with Brandon(The main character) fighting the creations that the evil company that his old friend(Harry) created. After that the series goes back in time to Brandon's and Harry's(The other main character(the creater of the creatures)) past. Its starts out with there teenage years. They are the leaders of a small group of street punks, but they were good kids that enjoyed the simple things in life. There group had five members including Brandon and Harry. They were all the best of friends not because they shared a common goal, but because they were all misfits. Then They get into a battle that comes back to bite them. They beat up a mafia leaders younger brother and so the mafia leader kills all of them except Harry and Brandon. Then because that mafia leader did that the mafia he was apart of killed him. Brandon and Harry then join the mafia making a pact to do what ever it takes to get to the top, but power and greed can corrupt even the purest of souls. Well I don't want to spoil the whole story now do I?

This series is something that I can watch agian and agian. I recommend this series to anyone that enjoys watching anime. There is some foul language and blood, but nothing to serious. I do not recommend people under the age of 13 to watch this series. If you watch this series you will not regret it and will most likely want to watch this anime over and over agian.

2319556,5,B0009UC6M6,I love this Anime great story between 2 best friends who go back and forth. Great action as well not just talking but evens out.,1268611200,3,128,4.16
2319557,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave tells the tale of two best friends put on the path of their own destruction. Brandon and Harry are two street hoods who join the mafia and begin the climb the ladder, and their ascension makes a mark on everyone around them.

Gungrave is a noir, mafia story with an anime twist. It deals with the internal politics of the mob at first, before it becomes something personal for our main characters. Despite being in the business of killing, the Millenion syndicate has an unbreakable law, ""Protect, and never betray the family."" The ""Code of Iron"" drives the entire anime.

Gungrave is not a shounen. It's closer to Cowboy Bebop and Trigun at certain points. There are no bombastic characters in the mafia. These are hired killers that disassociate themselves from their dirty business. The first half of the series focuses on Bradon's, the main character, memories of the time before he died. The anime twist are the horrors that unchecked ambition created, that Brandon must fight in the second half of the series. Despite being centered around organized crime, the violence doesn't feel gratuitous, there is no drug use, and matters of love (of any kind) are relatively tame.

I definitely think Gungrave is worth a second look. If you liked Trigun and Cowboy Bebop, give this a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised.

I gaze at that gray haired hulk and think, ""Beyong the Grave"" was once a man. A man named Brandon Heat.

I want to mention that you might want to skip the first episode of the series. It's supposed to entice you to watch more, but most might consider it misleading and confusing. Episode 2 is a much better place to start, IMO.",1267056000,15,1659,4.726643598615917
2319558,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave is the story of Brandon and Harry, two young friends that join a mafia group called Milleneon. The series begins with Brandon and Harry as ordinary young men and continues with their activity within Milleneon. This includes their movement within the group, as well as how they change as time passes.

This is a really powerful anime. The story is brilliant- it sucks you in very quickly and keeps you gripped throughout. My description doesn't really do justice to the plot, which is very complex, moving and intriguing. Brandon, who really is the main character, is very well developed, as is Harry and the various supporting characters.

The art-work is really beautiful, as is the music, which helps create a heavy, haunting and tragic atmosphere. I really can't recommend this anime enough, it's without a doubt one of my favourites. You won't regret giving it a chance!!!!",1261612800,,886,4.97972972972973

2319581,5,B0009UC6M6,"This is an excellent anime, which there are far too few of. Brandon Heat (Beyond the Grave) is the main character. He is mostly calm and cool, which seems to be a contradiction between the way he behaves and his name. He is basically raised on the streets with his friends, but finds love...to bad she becomes adopted by Big Daddy after her adopted uncle passes away. Big Daddy is the head of an organization comparable to the mafia, hence the title of this review. He is a very likable character, not the villian. He eventually allows Brandon to see his love, Maria, but only on supervised visits, since he now works for the organization. The anime follows along with death, love, betrayal, and revenge. The story becomes over the top around halfway through the show, with people being brought back to life for the purpose of powerful soldiers, which the new leader of the oraganization quickly seizes upon and sells them on the black market to conflict zones. This anime shows the possiblities of science, as well as humanity in its mafia style setup. This is an exceptional anime that should not be missed. I rate it #1, followed by Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Gundam 0083, and many many others. This will always be my favorite.",1247616000,4,1225,4.675925925925926
2319582,3,B0009UC6M6,"The thing with Geneon's untimely demise is that it offered companies like Funimation a great library of unique titles to re-release as the market demands them.  Case in point: Gungrave.  A stylish and moody piece of animation that had, until now, existed in a complete boxed set briefly back in 2005.  Funimation has gathered together all of the episodes and is once more offering a Complete Set for fans and prospects alike.

Coming in at a total runtime of 650 minutes, Gungrave the Complete Set spans 7 discs and comes packaged in seven thin packs within a richly decorated cardboard outer case.  Language options are standard sub and dub fair which means original Japanese dialog (Dolby Digital 2.0) and an English Dub (Dolby Digital 5.1) with English subtitle options in either language.

The show wears an appropriate 16 & Up rating due to its frequent use of violence and strong language.  However, and like most anime titles of this genre, the presence of sexuality and/or nudity is surprisingly sparse.

Features are a pretty solid bag and include 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen presentation, conceptual art stills, textless opening and closing themes, and a host of trailers.

The story, or what passes for one in this case, follows a guy named Brandon Heat, who has been resurrected from the dead and is now known as Grave (which is short for Beyond the Grave).

Under the supervision of a mad scientist and young girl, Grave wanders around his deserted hometown recollecting his memories and preparing for a mission of revenge against the friend who betrayed him (resulting in his trip six feet under).

The first few episodes take their time assembling Grave's back-story through a succession of flashback sequences that depict a slightly disturbed Brandon Heat's involvement in street gangs.  Once the gangster ""Mad Dog"" Ladd enters the fold, gun shots ring out, are fired, blood is spilled, and soon it's just Brandon and his best friend Harry MacDowel fending for themselves on the city streets.

For the most part, the pacing works.  How so you wonder?  Well the core of the viewer's interest is derived from the natural curiosity as to what led up to Grave's bizarre situation.

You realize that Brandon and Harry are thick as thieves in their underworld exploits in life but logic tells you that this relationship must have soured.  How, when and why? How does Brandon meet his untimely demise? More importantly still, how does he return to the land of the living?

You'll wonder these things just a bit quicker than the backtracking is able to reveal them but this is no big deal because a riveting story never was Gungrave's strong suit and shame on you for thinking otherwise.

In truth the story is serviceable here which is to say it represents just enough to keep the wickedly cool visuals flowing from scene to scene, episode to episode.  You may have heard it mentioned in other reviews and there is definite truth to the fact that Grave is perhaps the most unlovable protagonist of all time.  He's distant, cold, and drab- and that's before he becomes a zombie!

Although it should be dually noted that affection for the lead character isn't a requisite for making the most of the Gungrave experience.  The key word here is mood and boy does Gungrave paint a pretty picture through its lighting, ambiance, and just plain grit.  It isn't hard to liken the prose to the literary classic Gunslinger series by Stephen King.  In fact that's really one of the best comparisons I can come up with (just so long as you don't expect the mind-twisting elements that riddled the later entries of the book series).  Gungrave is definitely shallower, more violent, and linear in its pacing and prose.

The English dub works better than it has any right to and perhaps that can be credited to the simple fact that the roles clearly didn't require a whole lot of emotion (particularly that of Grave himself).  The secondary characters simply had to be gruff, rough or tough and American actors, if I may generalize, rarely have trouble nailing that assignment.  The Japanese dialog brings a bit more emotion to the script but don't expect miracles from Grave, he is what is regardless of which continent the actor portraying him hails from.

In all this is definitely not a title for the masses but rather is an acquired taste; kind of like black coffee or German beer.  If you're looking for a shoot-em-up with a simplistic plot saturated with vengeance (ala Kill Bill) and cool visuals (come on the guy blows his enemies away with his guns crossed and his hat dipped below his eyes for crying out loud), this is a must-own collection.  If, on the other hand, you find yourself in the camp seeking emotional attachment, rich storytelling or ultra-believability, perhaps you would be wiser to let this one drift past like the cloud of dust kicked up from Grave's cold stiff boot.",1247616000,14,4888,4.823741007194244
2319583,4,B0009UC6M6,"What can I say? Gungrave has to be by far one of my most favorite and well liked animes. I'll give a basic overview of the plot because I know you don't want to read a book.

A kid named Harry McDowell teams up with his lifetime best friend, Brandon Heat in crime sprees and mishap. But Harry, sees an end to this life sooner or later after the killing of one of the most well known and feared criminals in the city. As a result, Harry decides to leave. This sets about a whole new adventure with a criminal syndicate known as Millennion, a very powerful syndicate at that. The story involves Harry and Brandon's relationship as they rise through the ranks in Millennion and when betrayal is everywhere.

Pros:

1) Excellent animation, very well done. Brandon speaks very little but you can tell most of what he's thinking through the incredible animation.

2) Sound is superb! The music is very fitting to every scene in the show and the sound effects from gunshots to dying cries are all very realistic.

3) Voice acting is very good, even for the dub. They got great voice actors for this series.

4) Emotional involvement. The plot involves an idea that we all can share , a need for independence and freedom. Although Brandon and Harry find it in a different way, you'll definitely  feel connected to this anime on a whole other level.

Cons:

1) The series is too short. The story could have been told in a far longer tale, but they decided to end it at 26 episodes.

2) Some of the fights could have longer in the shows (some parts seemed rushed) and some plot elements don't seem fully explained as well as they could.

Other than that, I really recommend this series to anybody who likes animation. Even new comers will feel right at home with this box set. It's a shame the manufacturer doesn't make it anymore. But, hey there's always eBay right?",1235433600,,1857,4.480712166172107
2319584,3,B0009UC6M6,"I purchased the complete box set of GunGrave and watched it over 3 days. I'm a fan of anime's such as Trigun, Neon Genesis, Berserk, Ghost in the Shell and other popular anime.

What I found was a derivative and drawn out anime with very little character development, heavily substituted fight scenes, and a basic plotline. To top this off it is all filled with a personality-lacking, comatose main character, Brandon Heat aka Beyond the Grave.

While I can't fault the animation or the sound, I am really let down by the story. It takes really 20 or so episodes to really reach any kind of serious action. The story is unclear in its setting (ie. locale and time setting), and is marred by repetitiveness (despite one 5-star reviewer here saying it was not repetitive).

To put it into perspective, your main opponents are mindless zombies, a fat character who is rather annoying, and, apart from one or two 'cool' characters, the main bad guy who's basically.... a businessman.

Where repetitiveness sets in is in the talk of family honour, or code. The blase gunfights, mindless and derivative talk of revenge, and hollow love connections that are awkward rather than empathetic and hopeful. The men are typically either overly brave or full of cowardice whereas the female characters are helpless, teary eyed and irritating.

Suffice to say, questions are left unanswered. Where did Brandon get such impressive weapons from? What happened to his family? How did Blood War and his partner happen upon a necrolization machine? Is he really loyal to any one particular thing or is he just a walking 'problem' that exasperates the entire situation?

I expected more from Gungrave. Perhaps not the same whacky humour of Trigun or the rollercoaster action and drama of Cowboy Bebop, but the only recommendable thing about it I feel, is maybe for those who have a thing for mafia stories, albeit shallow.

Overall, sorry to portray it as such, but Gungrave to me is a failure in characterisation & plotline. It can easily be outshined by other anime, and that's where I think your money should go.",1229126400,3,2094,4.865168539325842

Betrayal and loyalty to the organization cause problems for certain characters, but even beyond the grave the loyalty of Brandon Heat will not die.  The Sci-Fi sets in as the legendary hit man is resurrected to return discipline and horror to the changed, monstrous, organization he once embodied with great honor.

There's no crying over doughnuts here.
There's blood, guts, tragedy, and the best representation of friends and loyalty I've ever seen told in any art form or in any story telling form.

This is probably my second favorite Anime ever.

2319586,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave is a very well written japanation about two orphan friends who grew up on the streets. From small time street thugs to the top of the made-men of the Mafia world. They are not ordinary gangsters; they are the best of the best. They are the faces of the most powerful Mob, Milleneon. Harry, the brain and Brandon, the force. Combine both their strengths and they are unstoppable.

Gungrave, I believe is a TV series in Japan because within every DVD, there are chapters. Each DVD is about 1 hour and 40 minutes long. It consists of seven DVD discs. I have a Netflix subscription and I have been renting this series for the past 2 weeks.

This movie begins as Brandon is resurrected from the dead. He is no longer alive which has made him a lot stronger and powerful. Unable to be easily kill by bullets. Undead monsters approach him and he rips them apart with his powerful new futuristic gun. The remaining hit squad that came to kill him takes off running for their lives. He is trying to remember what happen to him and why these creatures are trying to kill him. He realized that he is with a little girl and an old man. He begins to remember his past, his best friend Harry. He must find his best friend Harry. The movie than flashes back into his past.

Harry and Brandon are best friends on the vicious streets. Harry is smooth talker, a playboy who cons women into giving him the lifestyle he longs for. Brandon, a quite and shy boy who longs for the love of his crush, Maria. Maria is a girl who was saved by Brandon and have been by his side ever since. She lives with her uncle, a former mobster. The streets are tough and every now and then, unfortunate souls end up dead. Those souls happen to be Maria's uncle and three members of Harry's and Brandon's crew, they feel they need a new fresh start. They end up being taken in by Big Daddy, the godfather of the Milleneon. The most powerful mob in the city. Harry and Brandon started at the bottom and they both are determined to rise to the top. Harry, the brain moved up by increasing Milleneon's business profits while Brandon moved up the ranks as the mob's most deadly enforcer. Both are determined to one day be at the top and both are moving faster than any one in Melleneon's history. To reach the top, they have to eliminate others above them. Yet both are bound by the code of the mafia: Undying loyalty...betrayal is punishable by death. Loyalty to the family or friends becomes blur and decisions are made that will seal the fate of these two friends and their mafia, Milleneon.

The bond between this two is unquestionable. They are not only best friends but are brothers. You feel the connection between Harry and Brandon. One will die for the other. One will never leave the other behind. But in the world of organized crime, where there can only be one, you often feel, how much longer can these two last. The majority of this movie is about the past, the bond and friendship between Harry and Brandon. Maria, even though a part of Brandon's life, she has a small role in this movie.

Good:

Amazing graphics. The artwork is amazing. Not childish like Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z. The story line is also great and is adult orientated. These movies have plenty of violence.

No sex scene though, which is good. I remember watching Urotsukidoji, Lord of the Over fiend, there was violent sex every five minutes. A moving story about friendship, trials, and redemption.

Good over all storyline between Brandon and Harry. You feel for them and root for them to get to the top of the organization.

Bad:

I was getting annoy because the movie should of all connected together. It is broken up in series with each DVD. Meaning, after each episode, the movie will go through the credits. Going through like five or six credits in one disc is annoying.

The names of some of the characters and organization are also stupid and have very little originality. Crime family known as Lightning, come on....what a lame name...I'm not a crime lord but I would shoot myself if I came up with a name like that.

The storyline between Brandon and Maria was a little weak since she is the love of his life. But understandable if you watch the movie, it must happen that way because it is the reason why Brandon is the way Brandon is.

I wish the ending was a little better. Better closing for the remaining characters after the movie. What is going to happen to them, etc.

Overall:

A great animie, one of my favorites. I have seen a few. 5 out of 5 stars. Not perfect but good enough. May be I'm bias because I grew up on the tough streets...living by street rules...I don't know but I can relate to them and feel for them.",1221091200,2,4690,4.44988344988345
2319587,4,B0009UC6M6,"I won' write a long winded review, here's my basic thoughts.

First half: what a great anime. Good action, interesting characters, and a great story to follow. The story grabs you and brings you into this griddy world of the mafia. And never lets down and the resulting is already know but so satisfying you won't regret sticking with it.

Second half: While not bad, it's still weak compared to the first. Now that he's grave it's more supernatural fighting and less focus on the mafia and more on revenge. It's still entertaining but not nearly as well rounded as the first half.",1218240000,2,581,4.631067961165049
2319588,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave is one of those rare jems in Japanese anime.  It is a stylish show for mature audiences with complex characters, an intriguing storyline, stunning visuals, great music, and superbly directed action sequences.  The story follows the lives of two young men, Brandon Heat and Harry MacDowell. Both are orphans who have formed a strong bond with one another since they have known each other since childhood. Even though they are close friends they are total opposites.  Brandon is a shy, introvert, who barely speaks, a tough fighter, and the kind of guy who is highly devoted to the well being of his friends.  Harry on the other hand is an extrovert, a natural leader, a great communicator, good with women, a thinker, and a little selfish.

They spend their youth content to not have a steady-legit job in a dangerous, crime riddle city.  They survive through their involvement in petty gang activities and through coning people.  Their simple, wasted youth comes to an abrupt and deadly end when a member of a rival gang seeks to exact revenge against them by involving his older, mafia brother ""Mad Dog"" Ladd Carabel into the conflict that he his having with Harry and Brandon's gang.  Mad Dog decides the best way to restore his family's honor is to kill Brandon, Harry, and their gang.  He succeeds in killing off all the members of their gang and prepares to kill Brandon and Harry.  Just when it looks like their meaningless lives will come to an end they are aided by a members of another crime syndicate known as Millenion.

It is at this time that both Harry and Brandon's lives head in a new direction.  Harry becomes obsessed with obtaining the power that Millenion has and desire to take it.  Brandon on the other hand desires to not be separated from his best friend Harry and to locate Maria who is a shy blonde girl that he has affection for who has unknowingly become involved with the Millenion organization.

While in the organization both young men lose the last bit of their youthful innocence and Brandon's goals shift.  Brandon becomes a hitman for the organization.  He also establishes a good relationship with the head of the organization ""Big Daddy"" who feels that Brandon is a good guy and that he reminds him a lot of himself when he was younger.  The two develop a father son relationship.  As a result of meeting Big Daddy Brandon becomes a devoted member of the Millenion crime organization.  He wishes to use the organization for the reason that Big Daddy created it and that is to protect is loved ones:  Harry, Big Daddy, and Maria.  However Brandon's simple goal will prove harder to accomplish than it sounds.

On the other hand Harry remains obsessed with obtaining the power that Millenion has. As he advances in the organization he aims for higher and higher positions of power and uses any method to get there.  This naturally leads him to break the organization's Code of Iron (which is never to betray the organization or its members) repeatedly even though the penalty for breaking Millenion's Code of Iron is death. As the years past the only position of power that remains for Harry is ""Big Daddy's"" spot as the head of the organization.

Naturally Harry's ambition leads to conflict between the two men.  This conflict takes a deadly twist.  Soon Brandon finds himself on the receiving end of a several bullet shots from his best friend.

Fast-forward 13 years and a necrolized Brandon finds himself awakened from his slumber by a young girl who bears a striking resemblance to Maria who is being targeted by a Harry (now known as ""Bloody Harry"" for his ruthlessness) controlled Millenion for death.  He also wakens in a far darker and dangerous place than the world that he once knew.  It is a world where all of his former friends and allies are now his enemies.  The events that happen from this point on surprisingly do not follow the generic ones that typically happen in an action-orientated betrayal type story.  What you get instead is something far more effective and refreshing.  I highly recommend watching this show.  You won't be disappointed.",1195862400,,4110,4.7680339462517685

The Animation, by Madhouse, is really good. There's no denying that . I was actually quite amazed at the overall execution of the animation itself. It's good eye candy.

The sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1, which is excellent. Sound design was pretty good albeit I think they tried to make it too realistic. Grave's guns are thunderously loud and have a deep metallic resonance that you'd expect to hear out of guns that big. However that's about the best they did. All other guns in the series sound like toy pop guns rather that actual firearms. I should know I've shot a few.

The biggest problem with this series is the music. Now before anyone gets their underwear in a bunch I'm a big fan of this series' composer, Tsuneo Imahori. I remember being amazed by the soundtrack to Trigun, but Gungrave's soundtrack just does NOT deliver. The music is repetitive and very boring. It just doesn't fit the series.

For a series marketed on action it was very un-action oriented. The series was a bit too drawn out. The plot was excellent but poorly executed. Gungrave is the type of series that you can only really watch once. After that you know everything that's going to happen to the point that the series isn't worth watching anymore.

The series box is pretty cool with artwork by the creator, Yasuhiro Nightow, himself. That's about this series' best attribute, sorry to say.

This series is worth a viewing, that's why I rated it 4 stars, but if you're wondering whether or not to buy it my advise is to  rent it or Netflix the series. After that it's your call. It's a decent series. So give it a watch.",1150502400,3,1820,4.496969696969697
2319624,5,B0009UC6M6,"Everyone knows how great Gungrave is, but the expensive price tag might keep you away from purchasing this great show.  That's all in the past now, with the release of this collection.  Let me just say, if you ever wanted to own this outstanding series, now's the time.  This is an excellent series, in a fantastic packaging, at a very reasonable price.  The moment I saw this at a local Best Buy, I knew I had to buy it.  I had wathced the show a few times, and only the high price kept me away.

I uploaded a picture of the boxed set above.  Enjoy.",1147996800,8,550,4.180952380952381
2319625,4,B0009UC6M6,"The first time I reviewed Gungrave it was for the series as a whole, not for the complete box set.  I saw that a newer cheaper box set was coming out, so I waited.  I bought this Fully Loaded Collector's set, and while it's not as fully loaded as I'd like it to be, it certainly is a better buy than the previous one.

The pros:

1.  The DVD's come in slimline cases packed inside a very handsome box that holds all of them.  The slimmer cases take up significantly less room on your DVD shelf than the other box set.

2.  The option of 5.1 surround sound.

3.  It's $45 cheaper than the other box set.

The cons:

1.  While it is nice that the slimline cases make for more space on your DVD shelves, it would also have been nice to have more episodes per DVD.  I sure wish companies that make American DVD's of anime would stop putting so few episodes on each disc (I'm talking to you ADV!), and pack more on there to save us money.  I can't see how anyone really cares about cool front covers or how many different interactive menus can be used for each DVD.

2.  No extras.  Sure, you get character sketches and ads for other anime, whoop-dee-freakin'-do.  What about interviews with the writers, artists, director, or voice actors?  Companies like Geneon and ADV sure could take a lesson or three from the folks at Criterion who actually strive to make a DVD that gives you more bang for your buck.

Overall, the pro's outweigh the cons.  If you really want to own this whole series and also save money and shelf space, I highly recommend you buy this set instead of the other one.",1146355200,20,1585,4.301694915254237
2319626,5,B0009UC6M6,"Gungrave is an drama/fantasy anime set around the 1960's. Harry McDowell and Brandon Heat were just two young street punks, who stole things and fought other street gangs to survive in their turfs. Harry and Brandon, grew up in a orphange and have been best friends ever since. They were willing to do whatever it took to rise to the top and achieve freedom from their life of poverty and danger. Their chance came up when they met a top member of the most powerful mafia called, Millenion. Harry and his best friend Brandon, start off as errand boys, doing petty jobs inside the Millenion organization, but you'll see as they climb up the ladder and become, the mafia's top executives. You'll see as their ambitions and greed take over their actions for better or worse.

Gungrave is really an excellent anime all around. Even though its roots are based on a Playstation videogame, this anime is better than the game itself and should not be overlooked because you may have not enjoyed the videogame. The story theme about friendship, love, greed and betrayal is well scripted and feels similar to the, ""Godfather"" crime epic. Gungrave adds a supernatural twist by having undead creatures in the action. However, most of the story is told in a realistic fashion only dealing with the people drama. I enjoyed the epic feel of the story and became attached to many of the interesting characters, who were criminals by society's standards, but had a great sense of loyalty for each other. This is one of those anime series which contains a slow but engaging story. The production values are high; the animation is fluid, the artwork, character design, are excellent, the music is moody and the sound effects are loud. Both the English and Japanese voice acting are excellent and fit their characters well. There is graphic violence and profanity, so for adults only. I also recommend the anime called, ""Hellsing"".",1144886400,14,1911,4.844036697247707
2319627,5,B0009UC6M6,"Upon looking at the cover of the first disc and hearing that the series was based upon a computer game I was originally put off from buying this. I imagined the series was a futurist shooting no-brainer aimed at 10 year boys (no offence). However, seduced by the first few volumes being reduced in price, I gave into temptation and bought them. And, my god, how wrong was I.

The closet movie comparison I can make is to the ""Godfather.""  Two young guys, Harry and Brandon, who have been best friends since they were raised in an orphanage together, find themselves joining a mafia organization when their lives suddenly get turned up-side down after a petty battle with a small-time crook. The story charts what happens to our two friends after that, how both change in personality, and how eventuality they become fated to be enemies.

The story opens with Brandon being raised from the dead through human experimentation to protect the daughter of the woman who he once loved from Harry. The story then goes back in time and charts their lives through their late teens, twenties and thirties. The story is slow-paced while it builds up the relationships between the main characters but very rewarding as you too begin to care deeply for the characters, especially the gorgeous sexy quiet Brandon.

Although there are monsters in the form of genetically modified humans, the story concentrates on normal adults (instead of the usual teenagers) who are trying to form a career in the Mafia. Trust, friendship, love, greed and betrayal all influence the decisions made by our two friends and the people around them. The story also has the coolest action shooting sequences I have seen in anime.

With great animation from Madhouse (who brought us Trigun and Tokyo Godfather - but this is better than both) and voice talents from Samurai Champloo, it would be a great shame to merely view this fantastic grown-up anime as simply a videogame rip-off.",1143331200,8,1948,4.855421686746988
2319628,5,B0009UC6M6,"This anime has a very interesting story and well developed characters compared to many anime and even independent movies. I will not get in details but I can tell you that it deals with brotherhood, romance, friendship and betrayal. In this anime you will not find any funny or riddiculous jokes as most of then have.

If you agree with me, this is my point of view for some animes.

Worst animes ever:

Trigun: Waste of time, boredom, Inmature

Madlax: Do not even try to watch this

Record Of Lodoss War: Don Quixote has better action sequences than this

Sadamitsu The Destroyer: He destroyed my valuable time

Shuffle!: it doesn't get any worse than this

The best Animes out there:

Berserk: Made me want to become a fighter and a philosopher

Escaflowne and Gundam Seed: I do not like mecha but this 2 are good

Speed Grapher: Great, Different, fantastic

Cowboy Bebop: Made me remember the good times watching Cobra Space Adventure

Dragon Ball Z: Made me ask ""Why didn't I watch this before""

Gungrave: Read my review

Gantz: Great too!",1140912000,4,1044,4.69060773480663
2319629,5,B0009UC6M6,"More often than not anime tends to be extremely repetitive. A young guy fights his way to the top whether it be in sports, outer space or love. It's even worse when the show goes on for far longer than it should. You get 150 spisodes into it and the main character is still doing the same thing he was doing 20 episodes into it. Granted, this show is not some revolutionary genre buster but it is definitely refreshing and engaging.

I'll try and not to go into too much detail since there's plenty of other reviews already and if you feel like it you can find many spoilers all around. The show starts out right in the thick of things. A fair comparison can be made with ""Berserk"" since both shows drop you into things with not much explanation and then take their time to flesh things out. I had read very little about the show when I bought it and after watching the first episode it didn't really seem all that special. Just another cool looking guy shoothing thugs up but I kept watching since even if it did turn out that way it'd still have probably been somewhat entertaining. However, once things start getting fleshed out and we're introduced to the characters you realize there's a lot more going on here.

At the center of the story we have Brandon Heat. He's part of a small time gang led by his life long friend Harry McDowell. They're just a bunch of young guys trying to survive and if they can make a few bucks while they're at it then they certainly welcome the chance. Harry isn't happy where he is though and we eventually come to see that Harry wants to make it to the top. Brandon doesn't really seem to have the same strong feelings he just kind of follows his friend and they slowly move forward. I realize I'm being a bit vague but I think vague is best.

There's quite a bit of violence but it's not really gratuitous. This is pretty much a show about a crime syndicate and obviously there's going to be a decent amount of killing. It's not like the show looks for excuses to have shooting it is simply a product of the subject matter. Even later in the series when it gets a little more gun heavy it doesn't cross the line. Perhaps because the whole series builds up to that point or perhaps because it's well made but it works.

It's a joy to watch the relationships unfold. The soundtrack is great. Definitely worth picking up. The animation is well done and the show ends right where it should. Like a good show it doesn't lose steam at the end but rather it leaves you wanting more. Not in a bad way but in a very good way. A very good show all around, definitely worth buying.",1140134400,44,2608,4.316326530612245
2319650,5,B0009UC6M6,"I'd heard that it was a good show, but I hadn't really drawn the initiative to get it.  Instead, I got Fushigi Yuugi (something I sorely regret).  I pushed off buying this show for way too long.

I watched in a few nights (something I've only been able to do with Cowboy Bebop and Fruits Basket) and was completely in awe of its everything!  The characters, the storyline and everything else in it was just fantastic.

Seriously, this is one great follow-up to Trigun",1135641600,3,467,4.511904761904762
2319651,5,B0009UC6M6,"It would be hard for someone to pick this with ratings from 1-5. So, as always I reccomend you Netflix this for your own purposes. I didn't get into Trigun and don't understand why everyone loves that. Seriously. I don't understand. Anyway, as most people have summed up the plot to this, I won't.

 However, I agree with one reviewer that it might have taken a tad too long to show us the Early Years of Brandon and his friend Harry, but in a way it strengthens their relationship and the story because we know just how long they've know each other and how much they've sacrificed and fought for each other.

Unfortunetly, the love interest for Brandon (Maria) is pretty much a caricature and does nothing for the story--or Brandon. But considering their struggles I can see how and why Harry wanted the Rise to Power, it makes sense. It's a good story and sad for Brandon; I liked Harry's relentless pursuit and while it was inevitable, I was still surprised by his betrayal of Brandon. Some episodes are better than others, the last ep was really good, I really enjoyed the series. Again, Netflix it and see what you think.

2319652,5,B0009UC6M6,"Brilliant, everything in this anime is brilliant!

Animation is one of the best I've seen, so are the sound.

It reminds me alot of ""Berserk"", both the darkness and the storytelling.

The story starts off with Brandon as a dead(revived) man, which then continues with watching his earlier life, with realistic episodes, the story and characters developes as never before, one of the best starts I've seen.

Later on, it becomes weird and very unrealistic, and with abit less story, and more shooting, but that's just a few episodes, and it's never too much of anything.

I think the end was very brilliant, I loved it, although it was very sad and depressing(that's abit of a plus).

Overall I can't possibly say anything bad about this anime apart from a few(1-2) less entertaining episodes.

I'll say as ""panda""; I don't think any other anime has ever touched me this much. It will with no doubt end up as one of my absolute fav. series.",1134086400,2,939,4.689024390243903
2319653,4,B0009UC6M6,"After watching the first episode, Gungrave seems like just another stoic tough guy vs. evil bad guys kind of anime.  If you watch the episodes that follow it becomes clear that a lot more is going on in this story than you might think.

The chatty Harry Mcdowell and the silent, soft-spoken Brandon Heat have known each other since they were kids in the orphanage.  Along with Jolas, Kenny, and Nathan they get by as a tightly knit crew of small time hustlers in a rough neighborhood.  They pull scams, hang out, and wonder when Brandon will ask  Maria out on a date.  After a tragic series of events, Harry and Brandon get an opportunity to join Milleneon, the most powerful Mafia organization in the state.

Harry joins Milleneon so he can have the ""freedom to take what I want and give what I want"".  Brandon follows him because Harry is his best friend and also because Maria is now in the care of Milleneon's boss known as Big Daddy.  The two of them climb the ladder of the organization pretty quick until Harry's desire for freedom becomes an all-consuming lust for power.  Harry betrays and murders Brandon, but unbeknownst to Harry, Brandon arranged to have himself brought back from the dead using ""necrolization"" technology.  Should Harry's actions become too dangerous and out of line, Brandon will wake up to destroy him.

It takes four DVD's for the series to explain how Brandon Heat became Beyond The Grave, but the story is worth watching.  The episodes showing Harry and Brandon's rise in the organization are entertaining enough so that even if the show never involved the sci-fi/horror element, it would still be a great series.  Milleneon boss Big Daddy is very similar to Don Corleone of ""The Godfather"" in that he'd rather live in peaceful days but he can be ruthless when he has to be.  Gungrave also touches on how alluring life in organized crime can be for the poor and the disadvantaged.  However, just like in ""The Godfather"", the wealth, power, and status of life in ""La Famiglia"" comes at a heavy price which can cost you your life or the lives of those you love.

The english translation of the story is a little awkward here and there, but the vocal cast is superb.  You'll hear a few familiar voices, most notably, Beau Billingslea and Steven jay Blumb of Cowboy Bebop fame, playing Bear Walken and Balladbird Lea respectivley.  The only drawback is the voice actress for Mika.  Normally, the Japanese vocal cast has the female character with the unbearably high pithced voice.  This time it's the other way around.  The voice actress for Mika is so irritating it almost makes you want to switch the audio to the Japanese and turn the subtitles on until her parts are over.  I actually had to do that a couple of times because her constant whining and whimpering almost ruined it for me.

Gungrave is a great series that combines elements of film noir, mafia cinema, action, sci-fi, and horror into an engaging storyline that leads to a powerful ending that will stay in your memory for along time if not forever.  If you could imagine something like ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"" with doses of ""Resident Evil"" and ""The Crow"", then this is what you would get.",1132444800,7,3195,4.682795698924731

Trigun's Vash was a kidder, but deadly with the steel. These guys hardly joke at all and it's a tale of struggling to survive at any cost. There's a theme of brotherhood, loyalty and betrayal almost like a John Woo anime. There are gang hits, conspiracies, and full out urban chaos and it becomes amazing watching it all progress.

It's hard to say exactly what goes wrong because it's essentially a series that does nothing right.  The characters are all barely fleshed-out stereotypes, and all of the ones that you're supposed to like are incredibly boring (the rest are mainly sociopaths).  This might be forgivable and the series be an enjoyable thought-free shoot-em-up if the action were decent, but alas that too is disappointing.

The story focuses on mainly two friends, Brandon Heat and his friend Harry, and how they started out from nothing and rose through the ranks of the Millenon organization.  To make a long story short there is betrayal, although in the beginning you're not really sure who did the betraying, and Brandon dies, only to come back as Beyond the Grave, and undead being who deals with the nastiest parts of Milleneon which is by this time being run by Harry.  My only problem with this series was that there was too much focus on how the guys came up in the world, which while giving a context for what is going on and pretty much explaining everything, it was a little tiresome for me, but I would still highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you like gunfights, love, betrayal, and monsters along the way.",1122768000,5,913,4.481927710843373

""To protect.""

This is personally one of my favorite anime ever, and not just because of Yasuhiro Nightow's (creator of Trigun as well) positively flawless character design. The coloring style is quite muted to add to the somewhat dismal, dark atmostphere of the anime and further adds to the very adult humanity that each of the characters portrays in their very own way. The climax of the anime leaves you postively breathless as you receive momentary flashbacks containing the close, brotherly relationship between Brandon Heat and Harry Macdowell and the fierce enmity between Beyond the Grave and ""Bloody Harry"". This powerful piece is not only action-packed and full of all of the classic elements of shounen anime, but also exposes the dark side of humanity through artistic means.

 More than anything else, friendships comprise the most essential trait in any gang. Once you join one, your fellow comrades aren't simply shoehorned into people you co-exist with; in a gang, your peers become your friends, your most trustworthy companions, the bonds strengthened through trials of fire. Loyalty is absolute, orders are unquestioned, and the unabashed togetherness a gang exudes is what attracts normally unassuming people to them. It is also because gangs, for some reason, have radiated a sense of devilish charm. Why do you think Al Capone was such a nationally renowned celebrity in the 1920s? Why do you think the life of a gun-toting hoodlum in a wife beater is so vehemently glorified in rap music? Why do you think The Godfather and its sequel are regarded as among the greatest works in cinema history? It is because people have a warped, Kafkaesque outlook on gangsters as a whole. They think poisoning millions with various drugs is cool; that reducing a woman, depriving her of self-respect and dignity, to a mindless cow is sexy; that knocking the daylights out of a man because hes wearing a different shirt than you is a must; and that pulling a trigger on another human being is an everyday occurrence. Even when gangster films attempt displaying the dangers of this live fast die young lifestyle, it rarely dissipates the viewers delusions of grandeur. However, Gungrave is one of the few stories, film or otherwise, animated or not, that fully delves into the most brutal aspects of the gang culture. In the span of 26 episodes, it presents a heartbreakingly realistic tale of how two lifelong amigos are drawn to this lifestyle, how it mentally and emotionally scars them, of how it eventually reduces their friendship to smithereens, and how it ends in the death of one of the amigos. Their names? Harry MacDowell and Brandon Heat.

 Brandon Heat. The name itself evokes the susurrus of the sweeping squadron of tumbleweeds drifting gently in the breeze of Gods own breath, with the sun  ripe and red  settling on another gorgeous Midwestern day. Brandon Heat, whispers the fragile droplets of rain, rhythmically pelting the cold concrete below. All the hours here in this town of no name, from dawn to the deepening dim, are marked by a couplet of sounds that, hand in hand, beat out the metronomic and immortal pulse of the land.

Click. Bang. Click. Bang. Click. Bang. Click. Bang.

It is Brandon Heat, and Brandon Heat is the land.

Men, strong men, who established themselves as household names in the seedy realm of gangsterdom, whose pride in what they do is as undilutable as the atom, grow silent when Brandon Heat passes by.

Women, strong women, who stood sentinel at every resting place from crib to coffin, gaze dreamily into the distance, content that they were graced with the presence of this man, this legend, this Brandon Heat.

For Brandon Heat is nothing less than animes Jesus in the flesh, our Lord and Savior himself. He does what he can to aid his fellow man. He performs the feats that are inconceivable to lesser beings. He is fatally betrayed by a friend whom he predicted would do so. He is later resurrected from the dead. Brandon Heat, he whose tranquility is of mythical proportions, he of nonchalantly long black hair, is Jesus with revolvers.

 If Brandon Heat is Gungraves Jesus, then Harry MacDowell is most certainly Satan (you can also compare him to Judas). Driven by a raging desire to escape his poverty-stricken conditions, Harry shrewdly capitalizes on the sleek charm of a veteran salesman, his iconic white jacket, his crooked connections, and his deceptively simple demeanor to bulldoze a path to the upper echelon of the mafia. Whoever serves as an obstacle in Harrys ascension to glory, whoever is regarded as a mere inconvenience to Harrys cause, is quickly and mercilessly dealt with; eventually, that includes Brandon Heat. Although Harrys actions prevent him from registering as likable or sympathetic, his willingness to reflect on his mistakes in the last two episodes of the series helps solidify him as Gungraves most dynamic character. For most production companies, The Anime Jesus and Harry MacDowell wouldve been enough to constitute a cast (the rest would be likable yet underdeveloped nobodies) but Gungrave decides to elevate the other characters into unforgettable figures (Before the series finale, names like Bear Walken, Bunji Kubashira, and Blood War will be etched into your skull). Not only is Gungraves collection of characters a work of art but the transformations they undergo is mesmerizing as well. Bunji, a hitman of great prestige, evolving from an ice-cold killer to a kitten lover is a truly beautiful subplot to witness. Balladbird Lee, who is among Harrys closest friends, morphs in a more subtle fashion throughout the series, as his voice actor Steve Blum slowly shifts away from using the easygoing playfulness of Gurren Laganns Leeron to the suspicious, low-toned seriousness of Cowboy Bebops Spike Spiegel.

(Before I write of what else stands out about Gungrave, I have to dedicate a few words to Mika Asagi (voiced by Kari Wahlgren). Among those who have seen this series in its entirety, she has received quite the disappointing reputation. Often referred to as the worst thing about Gungrave, Mika has been alternately dubbed annoying, unessential, and unnecessary. Id like to say that although her character arc pales in comparison to The Anime Jesus and even Big Daddy, the mafia head, Mika brings a youthful enthusiasm that this series needs; she also provides a unique perspective to the story as a whole and, in the end, guides Brandon to whats ultimately the right choice to make. If nothing else helps to change your opinion, at least Mika has a bigger impact on Gungrave than her mother Maria Asagi, who only existed as Brandons love interest).

 As you most likely know, Gungrave began life as the brainchild of mangaka Yasuhiro Nightow, who also created the great Trigun. To summarize that show, its a lighthearted series with occasionally over-the-top humor. As Trigun enters its second half, it edges further and further into the depths of darkness. With the classic episode Sin, the normally happy-go-lucky Trigun was consumed in the very essence of joylessness but that is simply Gungrave on a normal day. Unlike the anime Gangsta, which treats the gangster culture as something of a clich, Gungrave spares no sentiments as it painstakingly portrays the ruthlessness that its all about. Much like real life is, this series is a Shakespearian tragedy in that virtually everyone dies at some point. Characters crucial to the plot and those not so are murdered gruesomely, dramatically, and consistently (Youd be hard-pressed to find a Gungrave episode where someone doesnt die). In whats already an overwhelmingly somber series (even the episode previews are bleak beyond belief), the soundtrack helps strengthen the mood of the atmosphere with its melancholic jazz, folk blues, and classical (Violins are a particular favorite in Gungraves OST for obvious reasons). Theres also a sprinkle of some grimy underground rap beats and a bit of techno in here as well, causing this soundtrack to be one that appeals to a variety of people (Even BG, the song featured in the DVD menu, is a must-listen).

 Like Trigun, Gungrave is a series for whom one half is different from the other. Excluding the pilot episode (do not watch!), the first fourteen episodes focuses on Brandons backstory, what the mafia (called Millenion in Gungrave) is all about, and what Harry did to cause Brandon to desire killing him. Then, the last nine episodes (excluding episodes 15 and 16) return the story to the present as The Anime Jesus re-visits those he knew before, including Harry (they don't exactly welcome him back with open arms). Although Gungraves latter half is where it peaks in practically every respect, it feels more like an endless shootout between gunmen with superpowers instead of a real story (After all, Gungrave was originated from a videogame franchise).  In the end, whatever flaws I found throughout the series were greatly redeemed by the last episode. It is precisely when you assume that Gungrave is heading in one direction that it abruptly shifts to another, and its series finale is without question the greatest example of this. As a matter of fact, it exemplifies everything that the series has been defined by up to that point and is in my opinion among the greatest of its kind. What actually happens in that last episode? I won't spoil anything but theres a reason why I keep hailing Brandon Heat as The Anime Jesus.

 One last note (SPOILER ALERT!!!): whenever I ask myself whats the overall lesson Gungrave is trying to teach me, my mind rewinds to that scene in the last episode where Harry and The Anime Jesus are lying down in the dirt, their bodies bruised, bloodied, battered, and about to collapse, sharing a few final words to each other before they die, both regretting the decisions that led them to where they are now. It is right here that I discover what the lesson is: Dont join gangs.",1471219200,,9267,4.961315280464216
