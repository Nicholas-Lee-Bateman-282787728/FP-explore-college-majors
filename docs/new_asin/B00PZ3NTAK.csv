6838906,4,B00PZ3NTAK,"An absolute joy to watch! 'Slovakia: Treasures in the heart of Europe' shows how beautiful and diverse this relatively unknown country is. Pat Uskert and Mila Kissova take the viewer on a journey through a part of Central Europe, from Bardejov to Bojnice Castle and from the city of Kosice to the Tatra Mountains. A truly delightful film for everyone who loves exploring new countries and travel enthusiasts in general!",1429401600,3,419,5.0
6838907,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"This is an excellent travel film!  It gives a great introduction to the country.  It shows the amazing  natural beauty, and provides a fascinating tour of the cities, villages, castles, and other attractions.  It also offers insights into the history, culture, and people.  It is a wonderful treat for the armchair tourist, and is very useful for those planning their itinerary.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.",1421539200,2,412,4.985294117647059
6838908,5,B00PZ3NTAK,Amazing documentary.  I would recommend this video to anyone.,1421020800,,61,5.777777777777778
6838909,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"Watching the video really gave me a desire to visit my homeland. What beautiful scenery! The caves, forests and mountains are breathtaking. We noticed that everything in Slovakia was so clean. How nice to see the preservation of the old streets, colorful buildings and castles. There is a lot of tradition to see in the film, including favorite Slovak dishes. I still make my mother's recipe of haluska (chicken and dumplings). And seeing the Slovak dancers in their colorful costumes brought back memories of my childhood. Sixty years ago, my mother and I dressed up in authentic Slovak costumes and danced on the elementary school stage of Holy Trinity Slovak Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana. Thank you, Pat Uskert, for all your hard work in making such a beautiful film about Slovakia!",1420848000,,789,4.984848484848484
6838910,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"The travel DVD, SLOVAKIA: Treasures in the Heart of Europe, feels like a virtual tour, like I am actually there in that beautiful country when I watch it. The film is a year-long guided trip compressed into an hour and five minutes, and everything you'll want to know about how to enjoy the cities and what popular and hidden spots to go to is well covered. There are awesome ruins to see, great, beautiful trails, caves/mines (kinda spooky), and a castle where the first vampire movie, Nosferatu, was made. The history, the art and architecture, the culture, the beautiful people - it's all here. Slovakia looks amazing, like if Middle-earth had a thousand years of peace and technological advancement. And it looks like it's really easy to get around by rental car, tour wagons and rafts, buses, trains and even motorcycles. I'd actually like to see Pat Uskert do other DVDs for other countries, this one is so good. If you're going to Slovakia, like I am soon, or are deciding on where to travel in Europe, I recommend checking this DVD out. You'll decide to travel to Slovakia. :) Happy journey!",1420588800,4,1099,4.729166666666667
6838911,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"Great video about small country in the heart of Europe. Beautiful pictures, classy narrative and fantastic ethnic music make this truly a wonderful experience. Must see.",1420329600,,169,5.538461538461538
6838912,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"Pat Uskert gained on-camera fame as a UFO Hunter on the popular History Channel show, and his talents are on display in this just-about-perfect film journey, Slovakia: Treasures in the Heart of Europe.  Uskert is a natural narrator and host on this journey into his homeland  a country showcased to amazing effect for more than an hour in, shockingly, the first travelogue ever produced about what comes off as a true gem in Central Europe.  I was stationed in Europe with the Army (as was Uskert), and I traveled it extensively, but I missed Slovakia.  After watching this movie, I can say with certainty that I will do what I have to do to get there in the future.  Uskert takes us through the amazing history, the music, the people, and, very notably, the food of this wonderland as he treks the trails, caves, waterways, forests, and mountains by multiple modes of transportation.  And in a nod to his UFO Hunters fan base, he even takes us (in the countrys capital city Bratislava) to a landmark restaurant called UFO.  I confess I have been a big Pat Uskert fan for over a decade, since his earliest days in such projects as UFO Files Deep Sea USOs: Red Alert and Visitors: the California UFO Wave, but I think in this travelogue he has found his true niche.  His expertise on and off camera has reached a peak that comes out in every facet of this beautifully filmed national exploration.  The people I watched this with also admired the work, and the only criticisms from them were that Uskert was not on camera enough (which Im sure was his deliberate choice in order to shine the spotlight on his homeland rather than himself), and, in a segment that cited natural termite repellants that a village used in its wooden buildings, one fellow viewer said he would like to have been shown a long line of termites marching out of Slovakia  but these criticisms are minor when compared with this films spectacular accomplishments.  This disk is a vivid, professionally guided tour of a hidden-in-plain-sight marvel, and a clear $20 bargain.

6838913,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"Pat Uskert captures the essence of Slovakia through brilliant videography and narration. Pat begins his journey by depicting the moderate town life and people in Bratislava, winds his way through the countryside visiting and describing the many castles and culture of Slovakia; he includes footage and narratives of the natural waterways, including the Danube River, and numerous pristine caves throughout the country. Pat includes religious,historical and political information about Slovakia and surrounding countries.  He concludes his journey by climbing the great mountains in Slovakia. Pat's work is excellent; it is a beautifully produced travel video that beckons wordlwide Slovaks to visit their motherland. The DVD is a treasure itself to own and have for many viewings. Thank you, Pat, for your passion about Slovakia!",1417219200,,829,5.685483870967742

8689849,5,B00PZ3NTAK,I'm half-Slovak on my mother's side. And I always imagined Slovakia to be poor farmland - probably from the stories I had been told by my grandparents. So this video was a shocker. Slovakia has got to be one of the best kept secrets in Europe. It's beautiful! The villages are quaint and the scenery is breathtaking. I've officially added Slovakia to my bucket list.,1464048000,2,366,4.6461538461538465

8689852,5,B00PZ3NTAK,"Saw this show on PBS. Interested in it as it relates to my ethnic background. Very beautiful production
of a place that is little known about. The country is beautiful. Leaves the politics out and covers the culture
with a dash of history which makes the trip more enjoyable.",1459209600,2,275,4.63265306122449
