8208900,4,6303699650,"An in-concert video intercut with footage of the band on the road -- doing radio interviews, killing time at amusement parks, getting ready for the show backstage. The ""day in the life"" stuff takes up pretty much  the first half of the tape, while the concert itself brings the tape home  in Act II. An interesting peek at the band just as ""Cracked Rear  View"" was smashing sales records everywhere. Even Hootie bashers may  be forced to admit that, damn, that Darius Rucker can SING! Medley of  ""Love the One You're With"" and ""Fight the Power"" blows  the roof off the dump (or would if it wasn't an outdoor show).  ""Mustang Sally"" provides the coda.",948412800,10,650,4.6
