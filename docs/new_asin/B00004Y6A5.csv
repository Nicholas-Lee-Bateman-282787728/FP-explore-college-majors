MOVIE REVIEW

Tiny mutant slugs have invaded a small town that looks an awful lot like the small town in Lady in White (Slugs' exterior shots were filmed in the same town of Lyons, New York). People are being eaten alive in gross ways and the local health inspector Mike Brady (who saves lives dammit!) is trying to figure out the cause of the mysterious deaths. He gets the help of local sanitation guru Don Palmer and science teacher John Foley, who is just happy to be hanging out with the guys finally.

When Mike isn't pissing off everyone he is talking to, he is running around with a slightly concerned tone in his voice. Meanwhile, people are dropping like flies. Heads are exploding (restaurant scene rocks!), naked bodies are being consumed and everyone is oblivious to the fact that giant mutant slugs are coming out of their toilets.

Director Juan Piquer Simn has the amazing knack of starting most scenes off in Slugs like the beginning of a bad porno. We have the terrible dialogue with the awkward sexuality, leading up the moment just before the grinding happens and then BAM! We cut the scene! What the hell Juan?!? Don't blue ball me like that! At least we do get some boobies and butts to quench our devious thirsts.

Slugs is first and foremost a terrible film. The acting comes across like a school drama where no one reads their lines and they all snorted coke before heading out to the stage. Nevertheless, I can't help loving this cheesy, awful film. It's got amazing special effects, with some truly gory death scenes that tickled my dark, dark soul. The film is impossible to have pacing issues, as it just skips from one crazy scene to the next, with barely a connection between them. It really is just a damn hilarious film that you'll want to witness over and over again.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Arrow Video understands that horror fans love their terrible cult classics and they have done their due diligence in providing a solid Blu-ray release of Slugs. They have acquired some interesting interviews with some cast and crew, who all praise Director Juan Piquer Simn (one even says he is as good as Spielberg when taking in account budget and time differences). My favourite interview was with production manager Larry Ann Evans, who visits a lot of the exterior locations from Slugs in her town. She also shows us some props from the film. Us fans also get some commentaries with author Shaun Hutson (yes, Slugs is based on a novel!) and for people that like to listen to Chris Alexander talk out loud, you're in luck with a commentary.

As for the video and audio side of the disc, it's the best it's going to be, which is to say damn impressive. No video issues to speak of and the audio was top notch. I'm easy to please and please the Slugs Blu-ray does.

VERDICT

The Slugs Blu-ray will slowly wiggle its way into your head, leaving a slimy trail of campy fun times. The Blu-ray will fit perfectly right next to other bug classics like The Nest and Squirm.",1478217600,,3384,4.523731587561374
1371836,4,B00004Y6A5,"As you may have suspected from the simple title and accompanying promotional poster(s), ""Slugs"" is exactly the sort of film it appears to be. Mashing the creature-features of the '50s with an '80s body count sensibility, the film about sinister slugs snacking on the unsuspecting delivers on its simple premise. Looking for gross bugs, gnarly special effects, sometimes silly characters and equally ridiculous plotting? It's slimetime.

Director Juan Piquer Simn's film (which is also known as ""Muerte Viscosa"" due to its Spanish origins) is certainly a special kind of late-night treat. While admittedly light on plot or compelling characters, the main stars of the flick remain the ugly black slugs who leave a trail of carnage in their wake. If you've just eaten dinner, this may not be the best film to watch. Even by '80s low-budget standards, you really won't find more sickening special effects elsewhere. Even today, a scene where two lovers are pulled to their doom by a bedroom floor full of slugs is hard to choke down. Likewise, a poor patron at a restaurant who would have been well advised to not drink the water. I sincerely hope somebody wrote a negative review on Yelp for that one.

Sure, the film can be a little bit laggy between the outlandish scenes of carnage. And yeah, nobody in the film is terribly interesting to watch (though a lead character named Mike Brady might elicit a snicker or two). ""Slugs"" plays to the strength of its titular stars, and there's nothing wrong with that. Best viewed late at night, slightly intoxicated and/or as a double-feature with the likes of ""C.H.U.D."" or ""Sssssss"".",1477094400,,1626,4.930656934306569
1371837,4,B00004Y6A5,"Back in the 80s the glut of low budget horror films was running rampant. Most weren't playing in theaters around the country but the movies did make their way to the grindhouses of the world and then onto video store shelves where horror and gore fans flocked to find the latest release. One such film that garnered attention as well as a small cult following was the film SLUGS, new on blu-ray from Arrow Video.

The story is fairly simple and feels like it was derived from the tons of oversized radiation induced monsters of the fifties. A small town is having a rash of murders occurring and no one seems to know what the cause is. Each victim seems to have been eaten alive, their skin and flesh wolfed down to the bone. With no trace of evidence to connect the murders to anyone local Sheriff Reese is at wits end.

The local health inspector, Mike Brady, is called to the scene of the first known death. Brady and Sheriff Reese never have seen eye to eye, not in small part due to the Sheriffs always angry disposition. How this man ever got elected is beyond me. Looking for clues Mike doesnt find anything definite but he does notice a trail of slime at the murder scene.

As the film progresses more people are killed and in the most gore filled ways. One young teen couple is fooling around only for the girl to fall out of bed and into a massive pile of the man eating blood sucking slugs that are the protagonist in the film. Like the title didn't give that away. Nude and covered in blood and slugs her fate is sealed. The same holds true for various other town folks who are attacked and killed.

By the time Brady figures out what is going on he tries to warn the mayor and Sheriff. But with a major development deal in the making and the folks behind it in town no one wants to hear about it. With the help of his best friend, the town planner, they take to the sewer system with the aid of the local high school science teacher to flush out the slugs and bring an end to their reign of terror.

So the first question is, is this film any good. Seriously? With a title like SLUGS you ask that question? Of course it isn't a great cinematic achievement. But then again with a title like that and a plot to match why would anyone expect it to be Oscar material. So lets rephrase that question. Is the film a fun filled romp that is absurd, gore filled, cheezy and enjoyable if you let it be so? Absolutely. Dont go in expecting great theater and youll have some fun with this one.

The over the top gore aspect of this film is exactly what made those films in the 80s pop with horror fans. Having gone through decades with little gore and then fueled by films like DAWN OF THE DEAD the gore factor suddenly took off through the roof. Slimy slugs with big mouths and sharp teeth as well as being able to slide along faster than real life slugs seemed like a natural antagonist. This American/Spanish production made the best of what small story there was and created one of those movies that popped up on cable non-stop and rented well at video stores.

While those VHS copies are still found, more often than not for sale on ebay, this release puts all of those to shame. Arrow Video, who Ive hailed before for saving genre titles and non-mega hits that still have fans, has done it again with a quality transfer of the film. The washed out, blurry tape versions have been replaced with a sharp picture that is amazing considering the sources. The sound is also amazing.

If that wasn't enough the extras are enough to keep you busy as well. Included are an audio commentary track by writer/filmmaker Chris Alexander, HERES SLUGS IN YOUR EYE  an interview with actor Emilio Linder, THEY SLIME THEY OOZE THEY KILL: THE EFFECTS OF SLUGS  an interview with special effects artist Carlo De Marchis, INVASION USA  an interview with are director Gonzalo Gonzalo, THE LYONS DEN  an interview and locations tour with production manager Larry Ann Evans, a 1988 Goya Awards promo reel, the original theatrical trailer, a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork and a fully illustrated collector booklet with new writing by writer Michael Gingold. When watched with the movie its enough to keep you busy for an entire evening.

So SLUGS isn't a cinematic achievement that major film scholars will be dissecting for years to come. Its fun! Its one of those movies that you don't have to look for subtext in or find political implications running throughout. It is a simple monster movie with the oddest choice of creature you can think of. Pop this one during a party and watch folks howl with laughter while groaning at the gore scenes as well. Its a popcorn movie for those with strong stomachs and fun for horror fans who will want to add this one to their collection.",1477008000,,4784,4.472477064220183

1371839,3,B00004Y6A5,"The '80s were a pretty forgiving era for horror movies.  Computer graphics hadn't really made an impact yet so slimy prosthetics and latex molds lent everything a tangibly gooey fan appeal than resulted in some classic creatures features (The Thing, Tremors) and a whole lot of guilty pleasures.  Slugs (1988) certainly falls in the latter category, built around a classic nature-run-amok scenario that isn't so far removed from enjoyable schlock like The Killer Shrews or The Food of the Gods.  Director Juan Piquer Simon (Pieces) works from the novel by Shaun Hutson, providing some ridiculously squishy set piece scenes surrounded by standard small-town hysteria straight out of a '50s drive-in double-feature.

Health Inspector Mike Brady (Michael Garfield) begins to suspect that something isn't right in his quiet community after a number of bodies turn up completely stripped down to the bone.  When he gets nowhere with the mayor, who's focused on a big real estate deal, Mike teams up with a local sewer rat to discover the source of the suspected contamination...which turns out to be a infestation of carnivorous slugs!  Now Mike must stop these slimy invaders before they reach the water supply and spread to the rest of the world.

Slugs - or Slugs: The Movie as it's officially titled - makes for a corny good time for the first half hour or so, setting up the impending threat with a variety of gory death scenes, the most notable being a pair of horny teenagers consumed post-coitus right on the bedroom floor.  There there's the guy infected with slug spores whose eyeballs pop out of his head during an important business meeting.  Get the idea?

When Slugs focuses on its titular creatures and spreads around the fake blood and mucus, it's a gory bit of cheap '80s filmmaking that delivers just what the VHS box promises.  But as the plot oozes towards its third act, Simon seems to run out of ideas (or money) and settles for a bland and unimpressively staged finale set in the town sewers.  Add in some equally unimpressive dubbing (most of the interiors were shot back in Spain) along with lots of time-killing conversation scenes and you've got a creature-feature that asks its audience to suspend their disbelief...and their patience.

But Arrow Video presents a Blu-ray package with so many fringe benefits, it's easy to forgive and forget the film's foibles, starting with an impressive new restoration from original film elements.  This is accompanied by two audio commentaries (author Shaun Hutson and Shock Till You Drop's Chris Alexander), four new featurettes (a location tour and individual interviews with art director Gonzalo Gonzalo, actor Emilio Linder and SFX artist Carlo DE Marchis) plus trailers and a fully illustrated collector's booklet.",1475020800,,2780,5.067982456140351

1371863,5,B00004Y6A5,"Leave it to Spanish director Juan Piquer Simon (PIECES - 1982; EXTRA TERRESTRIAL VISITORS - 1983) to turn one of the slowest creatures on God's green earth into bloodthirsty, flesh hungry creatures and actually making it a creepy (if slightly overwrought) experience (not to mention this film's obsession with local government politics and basically nailing it to a tee!). Years ago in the fictional town of Ashton (actually filmed in Lyons, New York), some unscrupulous companies dumped toxic waste into the ground, causing the slugs over the years to mutate and become hungry for everything they come in contact with (in the film's opening minutes, the little slimeballs snack on a teenage fisherman and a drunk about to be evicted from his home). County health inspector Mike Brady (Michael Garfield) and Sheriff Reese (John Battaglia) drive to the drunk's house to evict him, only to discover his corpse has been picked clean. Mike does a cursory investigation of the house and finds hundreds of slime trails leading to the basement, but no sign of the critters that caused them. Mike and his best friend, county sewer engineer Don Palmer (Philip MacHale), investigate a claim by a belligerent constituent that her sewer smells awful (they all do, lady!). Don goes down into the sewer in full haz-mat getup to clear the line (where he discovers human skin and a huge cow tongue in the clog), but when something grabs his clearing bar and drags it deeper into the pipe, Don makes a hasty retreat topside. Meanwhile, Mike's wife, Kim (Kim Terry), a teacher at the local high school, must contend with the snootiest students this side of THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE (1955). Not only do they call Kim ""witch bitch"", they plan on throwing a Halloween party that none of the adults know about, complete with booze, drugs and, of course, sex (one mullet-headed female teen blames the drunk's death on the ""Goat Killer"", the town's mythical serial killer). As the slugs begin killing the townspeople in various bloody ways (including a gardener who chops-off his own hand with a hatchet when some slugs crawl into his glove and he then accidentally blows-up his greenhouse, killing himself and his wife), Mike notices a huge slug in Kim's garden and tries to pick it up, but it bites him (it's funny and frightening at the same time). Mike and Kim bring a few huge slugs to Professor John Foley (Santiago Alvarez), who seems quite surprised at their size (Later on, a slug gets loose in his lab and kills his caged rat. Believe me when I say that you haven't lived until you've seen a rat giving a slug a piggyback ride!). Alcoholic housewife Maureen Watson (Alicia Moro; EDGE OF THE AXE - 1987) serves a salad with some chopped-up slugs to her husband David (Emilio Linder; MONSTER DOG - 1985), who complains that the salad tastes ""too salty"" and, later on, he suffers a most unfortunate fate (he begins to bleed out of every orifice in his body at a restaurant, with baby slugs bursting out of his eye sockets!). In the film's standout sequence, teenagers Bobby Talbot (Kris Mann) and Donna Moss (Kari Rose) are eaten alive by a bedroom full of slugs as they are completely naked and making love. Since Mike can't convince the thick-headed Sheriff Reese that slugs are responsible (The Sheriff retorts, ""What'll be next, demented crickets? Rampaging mosquitoes, maybe?""), he and Don decide to eliminate the slugs the only way they know how: Salt. Lots and lots of salt. Not really. It's actually some newfangled chemical Professor Foley has created that makes the slugs explode on contact, but I would have used the Road Dept.'s salt supply, because they end up blowing-up half of the town!  Only Juan Piquer Simon (ENDLESS DESCENT - 1989; CTHULHU MANSION - 1990) could take a storyline so ridiculous (screenplay by Ron Gantman, based on Shaun Hutson's novel ""Slugs"") and make it so bloody entertaining. Not only is the dialogue a hoot (When Mike learns that the gardener and his wife were killed in a greenhouse explosion, all he has to say is, ""They were very nice people. I liked them a lot!"" Or this bit of hilarity when Mike tries to get the Water Dept. head, Frank Phillips [cameo by Frank Brana, who has appeared in nearly every film Simon has made] to turn off the water to the town: Frank: ""You ain't got the authority to declare Happy Birthday!""), but the gore and nudity goes way past the film's R-rating (Someone at the MPAA was sleeping when this was screened). Not only are there both male and female genitalia on view, director Simon has a predilection for popping victims' eyeballs out when the slugs attack. When the ""Goat Killer"" is revealed to be an actual serial killer (he stalks the teens' outdoor Halloween party, where nobody wears a costume except him!), I just gave up trying to make sense of the story (and the utterly stupid things some of the people do and say) and went along for the ride (The ""Goat Killer"" sequence is immediately dropped when the girl he is trying to rape and kill falls down a sewer drain and is eaten by the slugs!). The practical makeup effects are appropriately gooey and gory and the slugs themselves (many of them real) are slimy and menacing. We're not talking rocket science here; SLUGS (with a video-generated ""THE MOVIE"" following it, just so we don't get it confused with SLUGS: THE CARNIVAL RIDE) is just a good, old-fashioned 50's monster film with 80's gore sensibilities. Also starring Concha Cuetos, Manuel De Blas, Andy Alsup, Stan Schwartz and a cameo by Patty Shepard (REST IN PIECES - 1987). It's quite apparent that all the non-Spanish actors here were local New York talent, as most of them have never appeared in another film.

1371868,3,B00004Y6A5,"""Slugs"" is based upon the Shaun Hutson novel, but it's not a terribly literate script version in itself. Nonetheless, the movie is meant to be merely an entertainment focused upon the plight of a certain randy group of characters who discover that they are sitting on top of an old toxic waste dump where some special, er, nasty creatures await. As preposterous as all this sounds, there are many involving moments due to the interlocking structure of these characters and their individual stories. I enjoyed much of the film, but I wouldn't by any means call it essential. However, if you've found yourself watching re-runs of ""Matlock"" in the evenings, then this film might be the tonic you need in order to start discovering other titles that are awaiting your viewing pleasure.
The Image DVD release is good; there is a trailer, and many previews at the beginning, and a relatively good transfer. But, again, I have to nitpick a little, as an audio commentary would have been nice to hear in this case (I realize it's probably asking too much to want for a 'making of' featurette to go along with it). At least this is widescreen and overall a nice DVD. But if this doesn't look like your cup of tea, then don't bother. ""Slugs"" is rated R--there is a fairly graphic scene of intercourse (about thirty seconds), some very brief nudity, ""God-damn"" is said quite harshly about nine or ten times, some shocking gore scenes, and some fairly intense horrific moments--and, as bad as all of that sounds, it is a fairly tame movie otherwise. I wanted to like it even more than I did. C-",1392681600,2,1582,4.673835125448028

Even the main character's name is lifted from 70's TV, Mike Brady, so I was kind of surprised this little gem actually came out in the late 80's??

""Slugs"" takes place in a small New York town around Halloween. We meet a couple ""victims"" right off the bat, and the action gets set in motion pretty quickly. It seems that carnivorous, mutated slugs are slowly moving through the sewers and attacking the town's residents, and it's up to the local Sanitary Commissioner and a Health Department worker to stop the slimy pests.

Packed with some pretty gruesome scenes, this is a fun little creature feature that rarely takes a breath. The kills come fast and furious, and packed with unintentional comedy. While the slugs rarely seem menacing, they are definately gross to see (and hear)! The practical F/X look pretty good too, and it's a great reminder that even Z-Grade schlock like ""Slugs"" benefits from practical F/X over the usual CGI filled flicks of today.

1371872,1,B00004Y6A5,"Slugs (Juan Piquer Simn, 1988)

For someone who grew up during the last golden age of the horror novel--the one that started with King and Koontz in the mid-seventies and lasted until right about the end of the eighties--I haven't read nearly enough Shaun Hutson. One of the books of his that was ubiquitous in the horror sections of bookstores in the latter half of the eighties that I haven't got round to yet was Slugs. But if it's anything like the Hutson novels I have read, it's a good B-movie pulp-fiction kind of time with maybe a little more gore, and a lot more sex, than my mother would have been comfortable with had she known I was reading that kind of filth. I should have expected it from the notorious J. P. Simon (best-remembered in this country for the cult hit Pieces, which Eli Roth called one of his five favorite films in a Rotten Tomatoes interview), but the film adaptation of Hutson's novel keeps in the titillating bits, but changes the B-grade amusement factor to Z-grade cardboard-cutout eco-thriller stuff that is neither thrilling nor, oddly, all that ecological; where Hutson was usually trying to make a point with that sort of thing, Simon just used it as backdrop, which makes the film come off even shallower than one would reasonably expect.

Plot: Mike Brady (The Warriors' Michael Garfield) is the chief health inspector in a small town in the middle of nowhere (actually, somewhere just over the border from Kentucky, based on a couple of lines in the movie). Over the course of a few killings that are even funnier than those in the infamous 1972 ecohorror flick Frogs, Brady comes to the conclusion that something non-human has been disturbed by local development (nope, we've never heard that one before) and is on the rampage. He's right, of course, and given the title of the movie I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you it's slugs. Mutant man-eating slugs. So Brady, his partner Don (soap opera actor Philip MacHale in his only feature appearance), and a local maverick scientist take on not only the slugs, but the developer, the mayor, the sheriff, and a town full of apathetic consumers.

Sound familiar? It should; Slugs does nothing that every other ecohorror movie you've ever seen has done, and most of them have done it a hundred times better. Even the really, really bad ones like Night of the Lepus and Kingdom of the Spiders. The short version: this is a terrible, terrible movie, worth watching only when drunk or trying to torture people you know who have a fear of slugs. *",1376956800,,2534,4.689887640449438

The minute I saw the DVD cover and the title I knew I had to have it for my collection.  I live in a region where it's wet most of the time and slugs are a common infestation.  Having the slimy creatures featured in a horror movie, what could be better?
As for the movie, it's a standard formula, following the Jaws blueprint: only a couple of guys believe in the threat, the police and the mayor are scoffers.  People are dying in droves but few seem to notice or suspect that slugs are the cause.  It's up to a sanitation expert, a health inspector, and a science teacher to devise a means of saving the town (with mixed results!).  I thought it was a hoot.  Is it well made, good heavens no.  The editing is raw and ragged, leaving abrupt cuts between scenes.  The music is inappropriate, ranging from Psycho rip-offs to very grand tunes more suitable for parades.  The acting is fair to middling.  The dialog is hopelessly out of place.  I thought it was amazing.  The real stars are the slugs and they deliver.

In this case, sewer slugs are mutated into enlarged, opportunistically anthropophagous critters when they are exposed toxic waste.  People are dying, the slugs are spreading, and it's up to our faithful county sanitation workers to save the day.

It should come as no shock that a lot about this movie just didn't work.  The score was way off.  Often we'd hear uppity tunes between serious scenes.  For example, someone calls in that a dead body was found and as the cop is responding we hear some goofy sitcom jingle as he makes his way to the scene.  The acting sucked.  But there's really no more to address on that issue with a ""when animals attack""-themed horror movie about slugs.

Another weird thing was that these slugs seemed to come out of nowhere.  There's this scene where two people fooling around in bed.  Then woman gets up and slips on the floor which, during however long they were getting freaky, has become covered so densely with slithering slugs that you can't tell if it's hardwood or carpeted.  Where did they come from?  How are they that fast?  It's like how Freddy and Jason seem to just ""appear"" unexpectedly to make the kill.  Anyway, this was a good kill.  She flops about like she's in an oil wrestling match with a slimy slug swarm.

Slugs was a lot of things.  None of those things are ""great.""  But even bad 80s horror flicks deserve to be recognized for effort.  This flick was successful at being campy and gory.  Festive use was made of fake spurting blood, silly squirming sound effects, and fanged (yes, fanged), bitey slugs.  There was even an attempt at injecting some (fake) biology trivia when someone accidently eats a slug in a salad and becomes infected with deadly blood flukes which, naturally, explode from your face once they've fully developed.  This was the best kill by far!  It happens while he's trying to close a business deal over dinner and drinks.",1327795200,,2081,4.700831024930748
1371878,4,B00004Y6A5,"Bugs are often a problem in horror films. Ants and spiders cause a lot of damage and even friendly frogs can kick ass upon occasion, but this time, we have a 1988 horror gem where slimy slugs declare war on humanity.

Mike Brady (Michael Garfield) is a really cool environmental guy. He is constantly at odds with the Sheriff (John Battaglia) and isn't afraid to speak his mind. When he comes across a house where a man was eaten alive, a strange theory is given and quickly dismissed. Brady blames slugs.

Brady discovers a huge slug in his garden and brings it down to the high school lab guy to check out and when it attacks and eats a guinea pig, the cause of the deaths in the town is confirmed and the theory is proven, but it is still being met with a great deal of skepticism.

In one of the greatest scenes in film history, a business man is going to close a deal, but he has mistakenly eaten one of these slugs that had made its way into his salad. At the table, he falls to the ground and his eyes explode and he basically falls apart, screaming the entire way. What a great horror film death, but that is not the only notable one. A couple having sex get off the bed and step into an ocean of man-eating slugs, and the two naked teens get devoured in a painful way. These slugs are terrible things...

The cause of the slug uprising is discovered and now they must be stopped, but that fat sheriff isn't too pleased about it. Brady teams up with a friend and they go into the sewer, where the problem becomes even worse than they had first thought. The slugs are everywhere and they can also reproduce without the help of another slug. All must be destroyed if there is a chance of humanity overcoming them!

SLUGS is a wonderful movie. The acting is over the top and fantastic, the deaths are memorable, and it just got better and better and it progressed. I highly recommend it!

@ Slugs strong enough to carry off a female to her doom.

HEY, they never said this movie was Oscar material, hell this movie is so bad, it couldn't win the Oscar for the worst movie ever but it earned a spot on my shelf back in the 80's when it was a video and I was heavy into gore and now it's on my shelf as a DVD and now that we're into the 21st Century, not so much into the gore anymore but it's still one of my favorite flicks in the gore dept.

This movie tries as it does to at LEAST (...welllll maybe a little) make the killings look believable, I'll tell you what, they look more believable than the ones in THE WIZARD OF GORE.

I suspect this is what Ed Wood may have come up with had he been given this inexplicably large a budget.  The fact that this film even got made is an absolute miracle.  It is so bad that I almost suspect it was made badly on purpose.  However, this is a fine example of the ""Bad = Good"" equation we so rarely stumble into.  That doesn't necessarily mean you should run out and buy this.  To see if you qualify for this movie I'll break down what is already quite broken.

-SWEET MOTHER OF MULLETS!!
Is there any doubt what era this movie originated from when 80% of the actors have mullets and a third of them are women?  Yea, I'm exaggerating just a little, but rest assured; this is one classy movie!  With all business in the front and a party in the back, there is no doubt this is a 1980s snack!  I hear it's a little salty though.

-THIS SKY-BLUE K-CAR STATIONWAGON ROCKS!
My first new car was a 1985 gunmetal blue Reliant-K.  I drove it for 16 years until the battery died.  I couldn't see investing in a new battery when the car was practically worthless.  I gave it to Charity (it still ran).  In those 16 years, never did a dramatic soundtrack ever break out when I tooled around town.  By the end of this movie, I was busting out in laughter every time the lead character would rush into a scene with this crazy dramatic music and his K-car.  You must behold to believe.

-REQUISITE NUDY SCENE WITH LOTS OF TEASERS.
Never did a movie beg for nudity more than this bold laugher.  The movie starts out very promising; a hot babe on a boat who wants to go skinny dipping with some guy who's TOO BUSY FISHING?!  Of course, as soon as she's about to strip the guy gets himself all chewed up by some slugs; DANG!!  As the film meanders on, we see plenty of horny, middling 80s women who can't get their men to ravage them.  They wear all sorts of loose bathrobes and such but none of them come off.  What kind of a classy, 1980s horror movie is this?!  Well finally we get a 10 second sex scene between Mr. porno-mullet and horny, ""parents aren't home"", bipolar daughter.  Little is left to the imagination here (or anywhere else in the movie) and we get to see plenty.  Heck, there's even some beefcake for the ladies compliments of Mr. porno-mullet.  But you know what happens to naughty children in horror movies don't you?

-THIS HAM HAS A FIST THE SIZE OF MY HEAD!!
""Slugs"" might be the finest example of ham-handed gore you will ever see.  I felt like the director was going to have a PE if he didn't get to do his gore scenes; ""OK, that's enough shots of the K-car, LETS DO ANOTHER GORE SHOT!!!""  Well, the Director's obvious spastic teenage love for gore appears as such.  But I must admit, it was so ridiculously timed and executed that I couldn't help but giggle with glee!  We get more inexplicable spewage than you could imagine.  When I finally stopped laughing, all I could think was; ""WTF was that all about?""

-BOOM!!!  HEH, HEH, HEH!!!  BOOOOMM!!
The entire movie was really filmed on a shoestring so all the money could be used for gore and explosions.  We get a lot of BOOM in ""Slugs"".  The best part of this is why the explosions happen.  The script in this film actually acknowledges the stupidity of the explosions, yet explosions will not be denied.  These are some great Hollywood fireballs too.  You'd be amazed how many explosive are kept in a greenhouse.  This might be the one thing that makes me suspect intentional sabotage of this film for comedic purposes.

-I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DUBBING, BUT...
Some of the most horrendous dubbing you could ever imagine takes place in ""Slugs"".  You might ask at this point; EK, I thought this was an American film?"" and you would be correct.  But when your actors are stoned out of their minds and can't speak, what are you gonna do?  Of course, that's mean speculation on my part.  However, when you see a scene with mostly close-ups, dubbed worse than any Asian film, you will be forced to draw your own conclusions.  I have to say, I laughed my (expletive) off!

-WHAT ABOUT THOSE SLUGS EK?
The slugs in ""Slugs"" might be the one thing that impressed me the most.  First: I've never seen such enormous slugs in my life, and they are real slugs.  Second:  I've never seen so many giant slugs in my life; hats of to the slug wranglers.  As impressed with the scale and numbers of these buggers, I could never figure out how they filled a room so fast when they always moved ""at a snails pace"".  The best part is when an actual animatronics slug is used; don't go breaking the budget fellas!

-ACTORS (AS IF WE CARE).
Do you really want me to name these people?  That's what IMDB is for.  But I have to say, these people did an admirable job considering they had to know this movie was going to blow chunks.  Yet, they all were real troopers, rolling around in those slugs and getting all messed up in slop.  There was a genuine hint of sincerity in our heroes, Mr. K-car and his buddy, Joe Plumber (Tee hee!).  ""Slugs"" actually had a large cast of character that was mostly meaningless to the plot; wait... ...what plot?  Anyway, some characters added to the body count while others provided people to do the screaming at the carnage.  They all keep the goofy mood going for sure.

-IF ONLY THEY HAD ABBA.
Having Abba do the soundtrack of a horror movie might have been funnier than this, maybe.  Obviously I thought the musical track was funny beyond the K-car theme song.  I've heard of stock footage, but is there such a thing as ""Stock Music""?  I think that's what we have here.  I'm sure somebody could help me out with that one.  Regardless, it was appropriately inappropriate in fitting with the rest of the aspects of ""Slugs"".

-THE WORST FILM I'D EVER RECOMMEND.
Make no mistake; this is an awful movie.  If its intentions were to be the best ""so bad its good"" film then it would be pure genius only to be rivaled by Ed Wood himself (who did it by mistake).  I have to believe the Director had ""bad"" on the mind when he made this.  All I can say is that the final affect is successful at making me laugh about 20 times throughout the movie.  Whether this was the desired outcome matters not.  My recommendation to you is this; rent ""Slugs"", order some pizza, invite over a couple of close friends (have them bring some beverages) and have your own MST3000 party.  I'm not the first to allude to the idea, but ""slugs"" is ripe for vast mockery and hilarity.

This movie is inert ,flaccid and ponderous ,moving as slowly as do the mutant slugs at the root of the carnage on display .
It takes place in and around a small US town which is overrun by giant ,mutated meat eating slugs ,the result of toxic waste being dumped in the area.

The effects are OK for a low budget movie but the script and performances are dire .To be fair the actors were obviously dubbed, this movie being Spanish in origin but even making due allowances for this I can only say the cast is a charisma free zone .Muddy colour is no help either .

Naturally nobody believes this nut job until after a series of gruesome deaths including a guy whose head is full of baby slugs explodes in the middle of a fancy restaurant and some naked teen falls wang first into a icky pile of slugs.

No, their trouble stems from an amassing army of hideous, ginormous, voracious, mutated, carnivorous, slimy, sewer dwelling, gastropod mollusks, otherwise known as slugs...Slugs: The Movie (1987) aka Slugs, muerte viscosa, co-written and directed by Juan Piquer Simn (Monster Island, The Pod People), features Michael Garfield (The Warriors), Santiago lvarez (Star Knight), Philip MacHale (""Madigan Men""), Alicia Moro (Golden Balls), Emilio Linder (Amazons in the Temple of Gold), Concha Cuetos (""Onassis: The Richest Man in the World""), and John Battaglia (Mutant Man).

The film begins the killing quickly, as a couple in a boat get kakked, followed quickly by a bum, into two, seemingly unrelated sequences (actually, the entire movie is filled with seemingly unrelated sequences).  Anyway, the police find the bum, or what's left of him, along with a whole mess of slime trails.  Seems reports are coming into both Mike Brady (Garfield), the city health inspector, and Don Palmer (MacHale), a sanitation and sewer engineer (i.e. sewer worker) about clogged drains and foul smells.  Soon large slugs begin turning up in gardens, toilets, sinks, basements, and what have you...the nasty, little things are everywhere, and they're hungry...for meat, of the human kind.  Quite a few people get nibbled up before anyone realizes what's going on, and even then people are reluctant to believe.  After some investigation, Don uncovers some pertinent information about what's buried on the outskirts of town, something that may be linked to what's going down.  Wasting no time, Mike and Don hook up with an effeminate teacher/scientist, make plans to find the source and put an end to the nightmare, even if it means destroying the town to do so...its all out war as our three, plucky heroes try to save the day (and themselves) from the oozing horror that is...the slugs!

Well I tell you what, this was probably one of the more disgusting films I've seen in awhile... slugs in and of themselves are pretty icky, but throw on top of that some really visceral, bloody, gross out death sequences and you've got yourself a completely nasty bit of work here.  I did have initial misgivings about the film primarily because of director Simn's earlier film The Pod People (1983), a film so awful that the gang at Mystery Science Theater 3000 could barely make it watchable (it was featured on one of the episodes), but this movie was actually enjoyable, if you can stand the gratuitous gore.  The story is awkward at best, as it's continually lurching and stumbling about like a boozehound, offering up stoopid characters I think we were supposed to care about, but really didn't, along with others who seemed important, but really weren't...turns out they're usually fodder for the slugs, and there ain't nothing wrong with that.  There may not be much tying all the aspects of the story together, but Simn keeps things moving at a lively pace.  The acting is generally lousy throughout, but at least it was awful in the sense one could enjoy it if one thrives on that kind of thing.  The only character I found remotely interesting was Sheriff Reece, played by John Battaglia, only so because he was a fairly angry a-hole most of the time and provided most of the unintentional humor...one of my favorite scenes, one that also exhibits the execrable dialog littered throughout the film, has the Sheriff Reece and a deputy investigating the recently deceased, economically challenged man (i.e. the bum), who got his early on...the deputy is busy photographing the scene, and the sheriff tells him ""I want pictures of everything, understand?"", to which the deputy replies, ""Sure Sheriff."", followed by the sheriff yelling ""Don't sure sheriff me unless you know your sure!""  Say that a few times out loud and see how natural it sounds.  Here's another bit...as Don is leaving to go with Mike to find the nest in the sewers, he says to his wife ""I'll tell you what...when I do get back, how about we get nekkid and get crazy.""  Oh bruther...hurry home, Romeo...his delivery was hardly convincing as the actress playing his wife looked like the back end of an ugly dog...and about 20 years his character's senior.  Mike's wife (played by Kim Terry), on the other hand, was pretty hot, especially in the scene where she was wearing that slinky, black lingerie...what was really funny is the during scenes featuring these two, you'll see the actress playing Kim grimace occasionally as the actor playing Mike delivers his lines...you might think she's doing it because of the slugs, but she's really doing it because the guy playing Mike is about the worst actor in this film, and that's saying a lot.  Despite these weaknesses, the film does feature some good production values, and, as I said earlier, some over the top, gruesome death scenes with a whole lot of blood...not my usually my cup of gristle, but I can appreciate the work that went into the special effects.  There were two outrageously repulsive scenes that stood out, one in a restaurant, and another featuring a young couple bumping uglies in the girl's parent's bedroom, so if you've a weak stomach, stay away.  The structure of the story might be a mess and full of annoying characters, but ending is definitely worth hanging around for as it's satisfyingly bursting with flame broiled goodness...my only wish was the two main characters in the final sequence had traded places.  If you're interested, there is some decent nekkidness in here, at least one scene, and it didn't feature the actress playing Don's wife, thank heavens...

The widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic print on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through clearly.  There's not much in terms of special features, except for an original trailer for the film and liner notes by Michael Felsher in a booklet insert, the cover featuring a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art for the film.  If you're interested in buying this DVD, I'd suggest doing what I did and buying the Anchor Bay DVD Fright Pack: Man's Worst Friends, which features six films including Parasite (1982), Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat (1989), Slugs: The Movie (1988), Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror (1984), Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), and Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971). It's available here on the Amazon website, at a really good price, and cheaper than buying the individual releases.

The special effects in this movie are very well done. I'd recommend you not watch this movie alone in the dark. Don't say I didn't warn you.",1012867200,7,496,4.177083333333333
1371901,3,B00004Y6A5,"Every country has its own self-delusional hack when it comes to genre films: In Italy, it's Bruno Mattei (""Night of the Zombies"").  In the US, it's the once-great Tobe Hooper (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"", ""Spontaneous Combustion"", ""The Mangler"").  And in Spain, it's Juan Piquer Simon, the type of director who you can almost see watching the daily playback of his films, smiling with Ed Woodsian delight over how WELL things are going.
""Slugs"" is probably one of Piquer Simon's better films, and that's only if it's viewed for laughs.  Really, carnivorous slugs making progress through a small town, eating up everyone in their path?  Gimme a break.  This tripe is directed with an obviously straight face, but neither the actors nor script are up to the challenge, so most of it comes across as unintentionally comic (thank God).  You get the Health Inspector who's aware of the problem but whom no one believes, his Sewer Cleaning(?) buddy who's turned into chum, a Dorky Science Professor (complete with a snooty English accent) who just happens to be an expert on slugs, and the Requisite Horny Teens having what looks like the dullest Halloween party in history.  Put these--along with countless other stock characters--in a blender, and you have a campy treat (but only for genre fans who are used to this sort of bad-good rubbish).
But what about the slugs?  Yes, they are nasty critters who, despite their slowness, can somehow occupy entire rooms within minutes if so motivated (note the funny sex scene), and only seem to come around to knock off annoyingly unlikable characters (which I applaud).  In all seriousness, there is an excellent effect in which a guy's (actually a refugee from Piquer Simon's ""Pod People,"" MST3K fans take note) head melts/explodes into a shower of maggots and leeches (er, slugs) right in the middle of a restaurant meal!
Anchor Bay's DVD has the usual excellent picture quality, but the extras are sadly sparse.  One can only hope that Juan Piquer Simon will contribute some commentary to his masterpieces in the future...",991699200,9,2064,4.973837209302325
