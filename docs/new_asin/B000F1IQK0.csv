Okay, this isn't a skin flick, but rather an up-close, in-your-face view of the life and times of Trina.  Representing Slip-N-Slide to the fullest, the raunchy rapper gives her fans a behind-the-scenes look at not only her rap career in general, but also her videos as well as a live concert performance.  It is actually three different concerts that are spliced together quite uniquely to say the least.

She performs all of her hits as well as some verses from her guest spots on other artists' work.  From ""Nann"" to ""B R Right""  to ""No Panties"" to ""Here We Go,"" Trina drops it like it's hot from one track to the next.  Despite some of the amateurish video footage for her documentary, fans will still appreciate the offering on Live and Uncut.",1157673600,4,837,4.54
8212168,1,B000F1IQK0,"I like Trina. I like most of her songs. She's great. So believe me when I say:

This dvd live performance runs for about 30 minutes. There are no full songs, and some (like Don't Trip) are just backing vocals and not live. The sound quality is so bad you can't hear her. When you can hear her, it's as if she's just shouting along to an album sampler, not a proper live gig.

I don't want to be so negative, but the camera angles are shocking and you never get a great look at her.

On the good side, she does her bits from Right Thurr and other appearances on songs, so that was a surprise.

The special features are dubbed from VHS and barely audible. This also goes for about 30 mintues but is mostly walking around, radio interviews and behind the scenes (note: you really can't understand much of it). I've never really been disappointed with any purchase from Amazon, but this one is pretty bad. Please Trina, spend some of that cash on DVD production and just give us a simple, full live set and a few good vids.",1155168000,7,1019,4.2642487046632125
8212169,2,B000F1IQK0,"Im also a big Trina fan also, but the sound quality is not very good at all.  In the main menu of this DVD looks way off, its off to the right side.  Slip N Slide Records needs to do a little job of making a better documentary of Trina.  The scenes that I never seen were okay.  Live Performances were okay, but everything else needs work.  If you're not a big Trina fan or you are, its not worth your money and time.  I was not impressed about this DVD.
