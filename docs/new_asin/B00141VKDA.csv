8254033,1,B00141VKDA,"Politically correct, innocuous continuation of Lonesome Dove, in no way resembling the original mini-series.  Mediocre acting and writing, rehashed western stories, nothing new to be seen here.  If you're expecting the same viewing experience as the original, you'll be sadly disappointed.  We watched a few episodes before putting it on the shelf, won't be bothering with any more.  Probably should be labeled 'For Ages 12 and Down'.",1416873600,,434,5.432835820895522
