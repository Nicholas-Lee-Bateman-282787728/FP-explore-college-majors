8391714,5,B0038RSIZG,I loved these two movies!! First time seeing them again since the 1970's!,1521244800,,73,4.6923076923076925
8391715,5,B0038RSIZG,"Marvelous. ""Come Die With Me"" gives us an unattractive woman (played by Eileen Brennan) who coolly uses her wits to unfairly ensnare the man she's always loved. Really unexpected ending. The acting is what you'd expect from Brennan--in other words, magnificent. Dark Shadows fans will be amazed to see Kathryn Leigh Scott in a supporting role, with puffy hair and a bad attitude! ""The Invasion of Carol Enders"" is another success. Enders (Meredith Baxter) nearly dies in an accident and is brought to the same hospital where another female patient is simultaneously in the throes of death. Their souls somehow fuse. Brilliant acting. Dark Shadows fans get another thrill as James Storm does a quick but vital cameo.",1503619200,,715,5.067796610169491
8391716,5,B0038RSIZG,"I enjoyed these movies very much.  I am a big Dark Shadows fan and loved seeing the people from that show in these movies.  I really enjoyed ""Come Die With Me""  with Eileen Brennan and George Maharis.  They really made it a joy to watch.",1471564800,,237,4.2
8391717,1,B0038RSIZG,"OK, where do I begin.  Yes, that's right...this is total CRAP!  I bought this video because I enjoy both Meredith Baxter and Eileen Brennan.  I never heard of either of these SMARMY films and wasn't expecting much. Honestly, these were worse than I expected...MUCH WORSE!! Both movies were poorly filmed, written, directed and poorly acted.  I think the actors were reading from que cards like on an old soap opera from the 1970's.  Just awful. Save your money.  This double feature is a waste of time.",1325894400,,502,4.77906976744186
8391718,2,B0038RSIZG,"Okay, these movies run like mini soap operas. ""Come Die with Me"" (that's how you'll ask your friends to watch it with you!) Has Kathryn Leigh Scott (D.S. Josette/Maggie Evans) playing the girlfriend to this guy who murders his brother and the house keeper wants him to stay their with her. Invasion of Carol Enders is about a woman's spirit taking over a young lady named Carol Enders. John Karlen (D.S. Willie Loomis) is in this one - he plays the drunken ex-husband in need of money (He always makes me laugh!). The odd thing about these movies is hearing Dark Shadows music cues for scenes that do not require that much build up. So, basically if you want to make fun of something that has our old friends from Dark Shadows in it Or, if you like soap opera's from the 1970's but don't have the time to watch an entire series - than this set is for you!. I actually like the music to lull me to sleep at night when I try to forget that I over paid.",1280016000,6,950,4.254143646408839
