7806678,3,6300229637,"This entry in the Classic Turkey Hall of Shame has been re-edited by Rhino into something that only a cheesy movie nut (such as myself) can appreciate.  Even without the editorial tampering, this film has the look of a real stinker.  A pop/rock soundtrack is added for enhanced listening fun.  Archeologists, who just don't get it, resurrect the Aztec Mummy.  Kharis, er, Carlos has trouble deciding if he is a mummy or a vampire bat.  This plot development really catches the unwary first time viewer by surprise.  A Fu Manchu clone called The Dragon leads a gang of diabolic criminals in a nefarious scheme to steal the ancient code that has super power.  One of the Wrestling Women happens to date a Mexican cop who investigates The Dragon's crime wave.  Im-ho-tep, er, Pablo confronts the crooks in a great cinematic showdown.  It is wonderful how these various strands all come together.  Low budget trappings abound with a flavor that is definitely south of the border.  The WW duo look fetching in wrestling tights.  It's amazing that Mexican lady wrestlers are so statuesque.  Their fight in the ring with two Japanese judo girls is a highpoint, of a sort.  Yes, it is so bad, it's good.  That is the point.  Good flick to be viewed in a group setting.  Proceed at your own risk.  ;-)",1070323200,,1292,4.691964285714286

Very funny lyrics to old Bubble-Gum songs and a Ventures sounding background, this movie had me laughing from start to finish.  Great wallpaper video!",1040947200,,271,4.723404255319149
