8432382,5,B004K4FUB6,"I just watched this very well made, documented & Narrated DVD earlier this afternoon, and I highly recomend its viewing by everyone whom wishes to have the understanding & knowledge of the challenges & tradgedies many faced while building this fine Nation of ours; There was never a dull moment in all of the film, and it shows how terrible and cruel-hearted some caucasian scumbags were in treating African/Black Americans whom were forced and sold and traded in coming here by their own people from villages in Africa when Caucasian/""White"" Anglo-saxon men travelled to the Continent of Africa in search of slave labor.
I am pleased to know that these disgusting, sub-human animals, whom believe they are ""men"" that bought & sold innocent African/Black Americans, and many were treated like animals, instead of human beings, and I am pleased to know that those
men that misstreated these innocent people, of whom many of their families were broken apart, and seperated from their Fathers & Mothers was a true atrocity to say the least, and it pleases me to a fault that those sub-human slimebags of caucasian decent are now burning in the worst part of hells fire...which they all richly deserve, as I have knowledge just what its like to be in hell when one dies.

I am of Italian/Spanish..(Not Mexican!!!) decent, and proud to know that none of my ancestors slave traded, as my Italian ancestors were also looked down upon by Irish/and other caucasian scum & were subject to much name-calling, & put-downs, because many of us had dark skin and looked upon as sub-human as well.
The entire movie was very well done and I will watch this and recommend it to other friends of mine, and am ordering a copy for my very best friend in New Jersey.
