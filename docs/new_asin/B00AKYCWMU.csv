5448251,2,B00AKYCWMU,While I love the movie the subtitles on this dvd(not even sure that this is not a bootleg copy) are just HORRIBLE. I would wait for one of the american companies to pick this up.,1364860800,11,178,4.114285714285714
5448252,5,B00AKYCWMU,Enjoyed watching the previous episodes so I am excited when they came out with this movie.  I don't often watch made live action of the manga I've read but I take exception to this one.  The story & the characters are very well close to the manga.  I enjoyed the antics of the group as well as the drama. It was just the right combination. Highly recommended!,1362182400,,359,4.3283582089552235

8553218,1,B00AKYCWMU,I love Ouran High School Host Club anime series and this live action film is terrible. I watched the entire film although I knew from the first moments that it would not do justice to the original anime. I hoped and hoped but... NO!! This is poor quality and disrespectful to the original series. I felt like I had to translate the subtitles!! Really!! They got my money... Don't let them get yours!!,1473724800,,400,4.493150684931507

8553220,4,B00AKYCWMU,"Such a cute movie especially if you are a fan of the show and manga. It got to me really fast as well! My only disappointments are that the picture quality wasn't the best and the English subtitles aren't that good. They seem like very literal translations, so because of that sometimes it's hard to understand.",1445212800,2,311,4.571428571428571

8553224,5,B00AKYCWMU,This was a fun way to keep the show going. It was funny & dramatic at the same time. The english subtitles are good but they could be better. Other than that it was a good show.,1376784000,4,177,3.810810810810811
