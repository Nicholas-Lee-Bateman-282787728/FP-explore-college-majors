7948564,1,B00005OBAH,"Yuk! After my son called me to the TV because he was to young to see Lara
Croft in the nude. I immediately turned it off and we decided to throw it away so none else would be caught off guard by this unnecessary display of rudeness. An animated video none the less. It does not deserve the 1 star I had to give to give it. After seeking a refund from the distributors,  my so and I decided that he can no longer purchase from them. Amazon was not to blame for this incident, but should definitely elect to post our review for other people that our tasteful and concerned about what their family watches. Thanks",1410220800,,610,4.213675213675214
7948565,5,B00005OBAH,"Every time I watch this movie I can sit there and enjoy it like it was the first.  Although some of the information -such as the small part about the next Tomb Raider game for Playstation2- is now older and you can find more info about it, it is still fun to watch, expecially if you know nothing about it.  Someone who is new to the Tomb Raider series can gain some background knowlege to the game, and some of the current players can possibly learn something they didn't.
There is even a little comedy in it (I don't think it was suppose to be funny, but I thought it was) when this Tomb Raider fan dresses up as Lara and walks around town (and yes, it is a girl.)
Anyway, I give it 5 stars because it's something that I can watch more than once without it becoming stale.",1045872000,10,774,4.153333333333333
7948566,2,B00005OBAH,"If you've not came here by chance, then there's no way you don't know who is Lara Croft and what's Tomb Raider.  It would be hard that you don't know what is Tomb Raider and that you at least know that there are more than one Tomb Raider game.
  If you know all this, then I doubt that this documentary will add a lot. First of all, we must clear out that this documentary was made for an English TV station and then it was released on DVD. In other words, it wasn't made to be an exclusive DVD documentary yet it was made just for the TV.
  The documentary is carried in 50 minutes, which are divided into 12 chapters. Personally, I liked two or three, and I found no reason why they made the others.
  This DVD focuses and TRIES to prove that Lara Croft is real. The first chapter is called 'Who Is Lara Croft?' and the last one is called 'Leaving Lara'. It starts by taking you to the school in which she's learned and tries through the whole documentary to prove she's alive.
  Focusing on weird subjects, like the OBSESSION part which cycles you with lots of fans who nearly left their lives for the sake of Lara, I don't actually see why this is important. Also, focusing on a weird woman who has a collection of dresses like those Lara wears and she actually wear them in public, are these the right people? Perhaps I'm the one who's not normal.
  Another man subject the DVD focuses on is her 'Sex Appeal'. It devotes a full chapter for that and then they return again for a similar subject in Chapter 8 'Uncensored' where they throw on you lots of manipulated nude pictures of Lara Croft.
  It's really annoying, it's annoying that through the whole 50 minutes they didn't talk about anything except three subjects; Lara is REAL, Lara is SEXY and FANS are MAD of Lara (truly mad).
  I don't know, but if you're expecting a documentary about the game, this isn't it. This is exactly as the name says 'a documentary about LARA' and as the picture shows 'Some Sex approach'. I was expecting more refering to the game, which is actually what Lara Croft is. I liked the game very much, but I never thought of Lara more than a character inside the game, not a REAL character as they were trying to convince me..",1026259200,16,2214,4.339805825242719
7948567,4,B00005OBAH,"Perhaps the most-recognized computer game character on the planet is finally recognized with a DVD which covers almost everything from her creation to the methods of her destruction to gamers' obsession to Lara lookalikes.  At about forty-five minutes long, there is an ample amount of eye candy along with plenty of interesting information.
However, this DVD is slightly dated, as there is absolutely NO information on the Tomb Raider film released Summer 2001; the film only gets a brief mention at the beginning of the main program.  Another disappointment is that there are no bonus items on this DVD: no new images of Lara Croft, no official biography, etc.  This is why I can only give a ""4"" rating to this otherwise excellent and low-price DVD.
One important note: There is actually nudity here.  Shortly after Tomb Raider became truly successful, various patches were posted on the Internet to allow players to see Lara Croft nude.  Part of the main program addresses this issue, and shows some images of the (very much unofficial) nude Lara Croft, even while voiceovers discuss attempts at preventing this unauthorized use of the character.",1018051200,9,1149,5.058201058201059
