3945250,5,B002L2I65G,"This movie addresses many issues the US financial system dealt with.  This is one of the first documentaries that show the solution to many of the problems society deals with can be fixed by the individual taking responsibility, rather than looking to the government to the solution.

There are many great interviews.  My favorite is with Salem Abraham; however, all of the interviews are very informative.  I have recommended this movie to many of my old professors to show their students.  Also, many of friends who don't work in the financial industry found this movie enjoyable to watch.

This is just another great product from Michael Covel.  This is a great office gift for the holidays.

Buy this movie!",1259625600,,711,4.915966386554622
3945251,5,B002L2I65G,"I loved this movie and actually bought it immediately after it was released.  I am a passionate student of economics and I have been at the edge of my seat throughout the past couple of years as I've watched the insanity build.  This movie has a very ""non-partisan"" flavor and has the tone of trying to help people find the necessary empowerment to not feel like a helpless victim inside the storm of insanity that is upon us.  The film spends a lot of time showcasing the ridiculousness of our situation, but later tries to give the viewer some answers to the dilemma of how to find security and independence from the foolish dribble that we are fed from the mainstream media.  While the film lacks the necessary specifics to go out there and know how to make money (pretty hard to do in a 90 minute movie), it provides a general overview of where we are at and what can be done.  The film spends a significant amount of time explaining that if we approach risk and uncertainty from a poker player's mindset, we can better manage risk and uncertainty in our lives.  It is essential that we approach business and investing with a mindset that risk must be quantified and controlled.

I actually viewed Michael Moore's movie ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" about a month ago and I find it somewhat amusing to compare and contrast these two movies.  While Moore's movie has a very anti-Capitalism bent, Moore doesn't explain any reasonable alternatives other than ""democracy"". Huh?  So, are we really just a bunch of helpless sheep?  The movie doesn't spend time trying to bitch about the system other than highlighting what has been happening.  The viewer is actually left with a little more understanding of what they can do to protect and expand their pocketbook.  If you are unfamiliar with trading and investing and want an easy primer and glimpse into the mindset of those who are financially successful, then I HIGHLY recommend this movie!",1259625600,,1939,4.721068249258161

This movie reminds me of the scene in ""Wizard of Oz"" where Toto pulls back the curtain and we see what is really going on.  It was refreshing to have someone just present the evidence and let us make our own decisions.  It is about time someone stepped up and made a documentary of this caliber.  Michael Moore needs to watch out because the white knight is showing his face in the form of this movie to debunk his dribble.",1259625600,,485,4.355555555555555

3945258,4,B002L2I65G,"In this DVD, Michael Covel himself travels around the world just after the Banking/Real Estate collapse of 2008/9 and interviews:

Real estate agents - Covel drives around with an agent and looks at the devastation of vacant neighbourhoods and abandoned homes.  A scene I found funny was when he stood on a proposed development in Delray Beach, Florida.  He gets an agent on the line and says ""I mean seriously it doesn't look like there is going to be a home development here for the next 10 years.""  The agent replies ""yes"".  Aside from this this section is sad.  I feel speculators should have known what they were getting into but it is still sad nevertheless.

Poker players - Some of these guys are professionals and make millions from playing Poker, one of the few casino games where one can beat the house.  Being a good poker player brushes up your trading skills.  The best player doesn't necessarily win the most hands.  They just bet when the probabilities are more stacked in their favour.

Lottery players - Millions of ordinary people think they are going to get rich in a game where the odds are simply stacked way against them.

Traders (Larry Hite, Salem Abraham, Jim Rogers, Peter Borish, Jonathan Hoenig, David Harding, Kevin Bruce, Barry Ritholtz and more) - I enjoyed this part the most.  These guys have made it big and just listening to the way they speak and think makes you realise how good they are.  Furthermore, most MADE money by going short and taking advantage of the crash.  On the flipside, those who bought 5 condos for nothing down are left without their shirt.

There is also footage of the crashes in 1929, 1972, 1987, 2000 and 2008, outlining the herd mentality of people who would rather be right & wrong with the herd than wrong and all alone...

The DVD is extremely watchable and I think when the next steamy bubble unfolds, it will be a gentle reminder that the world can be a scary place at times.",1258675200,20,1942,4.615160349854228
3945259,5,B002L2I65G,"Michael's work is important from several standpoints.
1) The information and perspective in this film touches everyone around the world whether they care to know it or not. We have made mistakes and continue to recycle our old fears and attitudes in modern terms.
2)Related searches to Covel's work include: Richard Dennis, Ed Seykota, Curtis Faith, and Richard Donchian. These traders understood the underlying principles trend following and why a broader market perspective will always dominate a day trading mentality.
3)Covel obviously has a vested interest in making money from teaching others-this is how capitalism is meant to work...so why shouldn't he prosper from his knowledge? Understand this from a macroperspective, and not your own personal desire to get something for nothing. This is the ultimate underpinning of trend following: defense will always win over offense, be patient, focus, heed the guideposts of fellow travelers but make your own journey.",1391990400,,970,5.473333333333334

It's kind of like Michael Moore-esque where you might really like his views or whatever and has a ton of potential but for me the best parts was when Covel and/or Moore weren't in the film and it was excerpts of their guests.  It kind of has the feeling of those lame traveling shoes where their always doing reflective thinking going from place to place like the viewer is too stupid to put together the dots.  Anyways I rant, I loved Covel's guests, podcasts, and interviews, but I think you would feel better and enjoy his books or making a charitable donation to him for his work in the blogosphere than watching this movie.",1366416000,,727,4.41044776119403

3945268,5,B002L2I65G,"Michael Covel has done a great job filling the void in documentaries about the financial crises with one that not only shows the people who lost with over leveraged mortgage payments they couldn't afford but the traders who were able to step in and profit from the trend.

Covel's documentary was both entertaining and informative explaining how the Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates after the Dot Com bubble burst helped fuel the housing boom. Of course the banks failure to even under write loans properly with income verification sped up the whole bubble situations.

You will see the losers: people who bought houses they could not afford, buy and hold stock market investors, tax payers, bankrupt investment banks,people that were flipping houses and got stuck,housing developers, and insolvent home loan originators.

You will also see the winners: the trend following traders who made money in October of 2008 by being short stocks and bank executives with their huge bonuses based on their banks earnings before the crash.

Here are some great insights from the movie:
Poker is the only casino game where you can put the odds in your favor.
The art of the fold is the most important skill in poker.
Just going with what the herd is doing with out individual thought is dangerous.
It is possible to make money trading in any market with the right strategy.
The art of the stop loss is the most important skill of the trader.
Self responsibility is the solution to majority of problems plaguing our nation.

I really enjoyed the tie ins with older commercials from the 50's it was fun to watch the economic principles taught even back then.

The insights for trading success by the rich traders in this video is well worth the price of admission.

This is a must buy for aspiring traders and people who want to really get a more balanced view of the financial crises than just the liberal media.",1339804800,3,1912,4.810975609756097

3945270,5,B002L2I65G,"This is a very entertaining and original movie, and I highly recommend it. It exposes the truth that the government, media & Wall Street are not your financial friends. Of all of the movies about the recent financial meltdowns, this is the best and most original.

Michael Covel provides insights into many financial issues that impact all American's. The movie looks into the Subprime/Housing Meltdown of 2008, and those responsible...the answers may surprise you. Where were the regulators when people were buying multiple homes with no equity, no jobs, and no credit? This film exposes who the winners and losers were. The fact is after all of the controversy, not much has really changed.

He also exposes the truth behind Social Security and State-Sponsored Lotteries. Why is online gambling illegal in the U.S., but citizens are allowed to gamble their savings away on lotteries that, statistically, they can never win?

Many top level financial markets traders are interviewed, including legends Larry Hite and Jim Rogers, also David Harding and Salem Abraham, two of the best traders many have never heard of. He also interviews many poker greats, including Howard Lederer, and Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz.

What struck me about the movie is how the Director was able to tie together so many different, yet inter-related subjects in a highly original, entertaining and informative movie.",1315440000,2,1402,5.217777777777778
3945271,5,B002L2I65G,"If you go to casinos or play the lottery. The interview with David Harding talking about gambling games and the laws of the game in regards to mathematical expectation, is worth the price of the movie. This was a fun movie for me watch,but i feel the general public may get somewhat lost during the second half of the movie. The second half deals with poker players and traders while the first part is on the real estate crises. You do not have to be a trader or poker player think about risk and odds. One negative reviewer implied that. If more people had a understanding of herd mentality, and thought about risk instead of having pie in the sky ideas about how much money they would make. They would be a lot better off . This movie showed just how useful the news really is. Not very useful and down right dangerous at times.",1309651200,,830,4.361290322580645
3945272,4,B002L2I65G,"One of my major complaints about Michael Covel's film is that it seems a bit unfocused, the pacing is a bit lethargic in some places, and the editing is off.  This sounds like a bit of a harsh critique, but I assure you the film is still worth it.  Broke is one of the more entertaining documentaries out there, with a lot of information on a little known subject of how many people have beaten the markets for years and years, and that's through the method of trend following.

Michael Covel has made a career of teaching the mechanical method of Trend Following, a strategy of buying stocks/futures/currency and the such at new highs, and shorting them at new lows, never averaging losers, never trying to pick the top or pick the bottom.  He goes through the housing market crisis, he goes after CNBC, which, in my opinion, is the Halmark of this film.

He is not crude, or mean, or offensive, he doesn't insult, just questions the logic, and lets the experts speak from there.  Even the experts that have been on the show like Barry Ritholtz or Timothy Sykes that had been on other such shows, reveal their scepticism over how valid some of these things are, almost everyone claiming they wouldn't invest in anything that CNBC said, just because it was on their show.  The experts get it wrong all the time.  He especially goes after Jim Cramer, for whose loud banter, complete assault on one's senses--sounds, images, and emotional intrigue--becomes a labyrinth of crazy ideas on investing.  Now, Covel, who stands against the concept of fundamental investing, who thinks the worst advice an investor or trader could ever take is to average losers, has especially harsh criticisms, and again allows the experts their critiques.

The rest of the film takes us through the poker tables, to the stupidity of lotteries, to the hypocrisy of our government banning online poker--a game that skill can win--and banning average investors from investing in Hege Funds, funds whose runners get paid for their success, but allowing Americans to buy futures, day trade, with no experience, or put their money in Mutual Funds, whose only incentive is that they get paid a percent of the money no matter how much money is in the account--a hedge fund might take a function fee of 1% or so, but they get most of their money as a performance fee, a real incentive that creates wealth.

His promotion of trend following is filled with interviews with some of the greatest trend followers in the world, Salem Abraham, Larry Hite (the legendary Market Wizard), and others.  The whole of this documentary is greater than the sum of its parts.  It has some great humor to it, even my father who's watched three documentaries in his entire life, two of Michael Moore's, and this one, enjoyed this film a great deal.

I'd highly recommend it.",1300233600,8,2824,4.748466257668712
3945273,3,B002L2I65G,"I caught this on a documentary channel and I felt afterward like some of the deepest-thinking reviewers. It leaves off a lot of folks who have been on the sidelines of life the past decades without money-making jobs like real estate brokers or hedge-fund managers; or the feinting poker players. In other words for those who must struggle, you must breakfast, lunch and dinner on hope to recapture the upswings of your homes or the generosity of your employer who hasn't shipped the firm abroad. The reality is, if you don't come back to your house with an exceptional income, keep looking. Because this documentary does not address the saps who haven't been drawn the cards on the table to put them in the game of risk and luck depicted here. It presumes that millions of other dwellers beyond the devastated areas have sufficient income to generate their American Dream. It begs you to have the mental aptitude of a Houdini. It wants us to believe that life has affordable risks if we have the instincts of a poker player; whereas, until the 70's, the American Dream was guaranteed by an education, solid marriage and sound character.

Yes a few banks went under. But there was not much information regarding what really happened to the people in the US (main street).

The documentary goes in depth and shows what happened to the American neighborhoods where people lost their houses; how families were robbed.

One of the most striking scenes was a part where a vacant house was robbed of its kitchen tables and utilities. This shows desperation and gives a glimpse on what happens when greed takes control.

3945276,5,B002L2I65G,"Michael Covel's ""Broke"" was a surprise favorite of mine in 2009.  I read a brief review of it on the Ludwig von Mises Institute's website (mises.org), watched the trailer, and immediately ordered a copy.  The week I received it, I think I watched it three times before loaning it to as many friends as possible.  The film uses the recent collapse of the financial and real estate markets as a logical starting point for discussing numerous related economic and social topics.  Covel goes back to basics and briefly explores the concept of what a ""market"" really is, using a Tokyo fish market as an example.  On its face, ""Broke"" may simply appear to be a documentary about the causes of the real estate bubble and crash, but Covel leads the viewer through some terrific observations about finance, markets, credit, investing, and the financial media that few others have made in such an entertaining way.

""Broke"" examines the sociology behind our economic thinking and the influence that emotion has on our decision making.  The film also points out how useless and even dangerous the government and media are when it comes to influencing economic behavior.  One of the most enlightening comparisons Covel makes in the film is between the lottery and poker, rightly pointing out that while both contain an element of luck, poker involves meaningful decisions and enough information to allow skillful players to succeed over the long run.  However, while poker has struggled to gain legitimacy and legal status, particularly online, lotteries are rabidly promoted by state governments who profit handsomely from their revenue.  I found the interviews during this portion of the movie to be the most entertaining of the film, and worth repeat viewings.

Several economists and successful traders are interviewed throughout the film, but they present views that you won't commonly find in the financial ""infotainment"" media.  ""Broke"" concludes by pointing out that there are lessons to be learned not only from the real estate bubble, but from some common sense observations about the way markets really function.  Its core message is that if you will stop relying on everyone else to tell you what to do and simply do a little of your own thinking, you can be more successful than the talking head experts, even if you aren't a sophisticated investor.  Learning the truth about money and markets is a great first step in that process, and I think Covel's goal is to help the audience take their blinders off.

I found ""Broke"" to be a very compelling film, and one that piqued my interest in Covel's books.  While the film stands alone, it's really a means to an end, that being changing the way the audience sees the world of finance and economics.  The film is a prelude to a deeper and more specific discussion, but I think it will appeal to nearly anyone, perhaps with the exception of fans of Jim Cramer and Maria Bartiromo (or ""Bartiloni;"" watch the movie to get the inside joke).  While it does document a specific event in history, it competently puts that event in the context of more timeless and important topics.",1294876800,,3122,4.903041825095057

If you want to be a successful chef you may want to learn about some of the great chefs in history and in present time. Study their recipes and then taste the results for yourself. Also know what not to mix and what things to avoid. There are people who already have made mistakes so that you do not have to make the same mistakes yourself!

That is what I did with my trading when I was 18 years old. That was 24 years ago. I learned about one trader who actually made millions in a short period of time and then he trained a lad (back then) named David Ryan who won ""The Barron's Investment Championship"" 3 years in a row.

I saw two things.

1) A successful trader.
2) A successful trader who transferred his knowledge to a student who also had some big wins!

Guess what happened after I learned from a book the trader wrote? What happened was I made money trading stocks year after year! SHOCKING! I learned from his success. William J, O'Neil was the man from whom I learned. I read his books and researched any information that I could find about him.

There is a lot of information about trading and about everything. The trick to being successful is finding out what is correct information and what is bunk!

I would say that I want my information about nutrition from an expert in nutrition. Not an expert however who is 400 pounds and 5'2"". I want an expert who exudes all aspects of health that manifest through his or her own personal health. I also would like it if the person has helped others to be healthy!

Michael has done this with the business of trading. He has found and connected with some of the most successful traders in the World and has asked them how they did it! His research is thorough and comprehensive. The movie ""Broke"" in my opinion is the manifestation of Michael's frustration with most of today's media. ""Broke"" is Michael's way of reaching out to the World and letting them know that ""MOST OF PRESENT DAY MEDIA IS NOT EVEN REAL INFORMATON!"" If you are into stories and fairy tales keep acting on information that is fed to you through most media outlets.

Michael was not just going to stay frustrated though. He actually set out to do something about it! That is why we are blessed to have such a movie as ""Broke"". Michael is a person who is actually interested in the TRUTH!

There are individual investors and traders who actually try to trade off of what is said in the media! I have never seen a consistent record of making money by using any of this information. Thorough factual research and using proven methods are major keys to trading and investing.

Michael Covel has been researching with the best traders in the World for a long time and he shares this information through his products!

Every time I read, hear or watch something created by Michael Covel, I am inspired and motivated to move and get some of the success that great traders and businessmen have had. His information has also reinforced the many years of trading successes and mistakes that I have made. This information acts as a reminder to me and helps me to improve my trading even to this day after 24 years of trading!

Get this movie and get ""The Complete Turtle Trader"" book.

You can take the hard way. Lose lots of money and make tons of mistakes yourself or you can give yourself a BIG head start and get some of Michael's books, videos and other products.

""Broke"" is very entertaining and not negative and depressing as the title may lead you to believe.

He has interviews with some top traders and investors like Jim Rogers and Salem Abraham! Who would not pay $20 just for that alone? It is entertaining to watch as well! That is great when something can be entertaining as well as educational.

Why would I write such a review for Mr. Covel? Because many people are experiencing so much pain due to the economy and life in general. Michael's products can help people to be successful and the methods he presents have proven out to actually work. He has put years of hard work into his products and it shows. He deserves the sale and the customer deserves the great and valuable information! My saying is simple ""Do stuff that works, period!"" Michael's products show us what actually works!

If you do not get this video as well as ""The Complete Turtle Trader"" from Michael Covel then well???? I guess you are asking for years of punishing lessons and lots of trading losses. Unless of course you are the luckiest person in the World or just happen to be a natural born trading genius! Have fun!

Here is his website with lots of really good free information as well.

I have watched it 4 times, read Trend Following the book 3 times, read The Complete Turtle Trader book twice, and have spent countless hours reading articles on [...].  That doesn't even count the time I have spent googling terms and concepts mentioned in Covel's works.  I am fascinated by trend following because of the lessons it teaches about investing in markets but also about the lessons it teaches in life.  This film will start and/or continue you on your journey to discovery and education in the fields of trend following and more importantly, thinking in probabilities.  I suggest watching the movie the first time for entertainment value, and then go back and watch it several more times and take notes.  I watched the movie after reading the books several times, so if you are watching the movie before reading the books the note taking part will help you start thinking about some of the concepts in deeper terms, which will prob lead you to want to read the books, which I highly recommend.  If nothing else, this film will open your eyes to the right and wrong way of investing, which could lead you to saving and/or making money.  Covel truely wants to help others, but he also reminds us that in the end it is really our own self discipline, drive, passion to win, and determination that will help us the most.

3945287,2,B002L2I65G,"I'll give this two stars because it was entertaining, but all of Covel's flaws are on full display here. Lots of both personal and survivorship bias. While I'll agree about dissing Jim Cramer (and Suze Orman for that matter), Covel is really no better and does the exact same thing.

In areas we agree on, it's serious DUH!!! time. You shouldn't buy a house you can't afford and the lottery isn't an investment. While it's a pity more people don't get this---it also ignores that over time, homes do appreciate and while the real estate bubble has burst, eventually all those homes will be worth more than what's owed (a house was always meant to be a LONG TERM investment). Also, if you buy your house with the idea of <gasp> paying it off, eventually you live largely rent free.

Most of the buyers I'm meant to have sympathy for just looked really stupid to me. And I found it hilarious that all the real estate agents were suddenly so judgemental of mortgage brokers and flippers. These same realtors were the ones that sold single mothers homes with $1800 per month mortgage payments (seriously, my husband and I would feel pinched with that payment with two good incomes) and happily pocketed their commission checks.

As for gambling as an investment---I'll confess to buying a weekly Powerball quick pick (and I suppose I could put that $50 per year to better use), but I'm certainly not planning my retirement around it. That said, to put professional poker players in front of me and say ""here's the way you can make money in gambling"" is like putting any professional athlete up there and saying, ""see???? that pick up game in the park could make you rich!"". They're professionals, with finely honed skills I don't happen to posses.

In all, this is a very disingenuous film. Covel is largely a motivational speaker (today's snake oil salesman), offering his own get rich quick scheme---he's just prettied it up by dissing the very people he's no better than.",1274659200,27,1970,4.73469387755102

Trend Following is a philosophy, and this DVD contrasts the thinking behind Trend Following with the massive amount of 'traditional' information that we, the general public, are bombarded with on a daily and hourly basis - specifically, what information should we be paying attention to, and what is a better way to think about markets to our own best benefit. I enjoyed most the interviews with the real, successful traders. And, of course, the supermodels in Miami thrown in at the end... Check it out.

3945290,5,B002L2I65G,"I recommend this film without reservation. It's well produced, entertaining, broad in scope, and carries a message that is central and relevant to our time and really all time: it is up to the individual to take charge of their own future and accept responsibility for their future. The market doesn't care if you win or lose. The government, whether through Social Security, lottery tickets, or market regulation, will not provide security for your future. Bubbles will form and bubbles will burst, as the dynamic of mania plays out between fear and greed as it has for centuries. Buy and hold strategies or mindlessly following media gurus won't do either.

The film has great interviews with some market wizards, some well known and some less known, as well as professional poker players, hedge fund managers, and everyday people on the street. The central theme is that risk is all around you, whether you ride in a plane, sit at the poker table, play in stocks, bonds or futures, or simply chose to do nothing--each is it's own form of risk. The key is to manage risk on your own terms, putting the probabilities in your favor, and let the expectancy of your system play out over time. This is a film for our time that everyone needs to see.",1267315200,2,1246,4.689497716894977
3945291,5,B002L2I65G,"As a 25+ year veteran of the futures industry and a trend follower, I commend Michael Covel for creating a unique niche with his focus on Richard Dennis and the Turtle traders.  He's done a very good job of explaining the reason why most traders lose money in both the short-run and the long-run.  There is no such thing as BUY LOW, SELL HIGH! But, looking at this whole idea from a purely selfish point of view, if it wasn't for the people out there trying to trade on that premise, we trend followers might find it far more difficult to achieve the results that we do.

3945292,5,B002L2I65G,"In Micheal Covel's film ""Broke"" he clearly explains the herd mentality and how human behavior works in a market setting and in other similar settings. You must go against the herd, if not it'll doom you financially, that is a lesson common folks cant comprehend. Just look around you, there'll always be 2-3% of the population that is wealthy (let's say over 3 million dollars net worth) and 97% struggling to get to that level, so a common ""Joe Blow"" should ask himself how can he participate in speculating in the real estate market or the dotcom mania and think he can profit from it, if everybody around him is doing the same thing, it'll never occur that the entire population is well off and wealthy from a bubble that the entire classes of people participate in, sooner or later the bubble will burst as well as their assets and lead you to being broke. In the DVD learn from the experts Micheal interviews, these are people that we call ""smart money"", learn their philosophies and outlook on markets and the mainstream media which confuses more than anything.

3945294,5,B002L2I65G,"Entertaining, educational.  Most enjoyable for me: great commentary from great traders.

With logic and fact-based interviews, Mr. Covel articulates several key messages in his film: Free market capitalism makes this country great. Media and government manipulate on a grand scale.  Financial network programming is noise.  Break from the crowd to be successful. Traders need an edge. Basic tenets of trading are akin to poker playing.  (This analogy was particularly articulate in his film.)  Lotteries fund the government.

My personal take away is that Mr. Covel's film is an endorsement of what I'm now doing in the securities trading arena.  Even though I'm comfortable with my trading approach, I'm grateful for the film's reassurances.

Viewing the film is time well spent.",1262131200,,780,5.433333333333334

Bottom line:  Buy this DVD; view it attentively; put it away for a week; view it again; repeat 3X - it will probably save your (financial) life.
Seriously.
Unless you're already a disciplined, practiced Trend Following trader, in which case you either won't need this superb documentary, or will simply enjoy it; or, you may have already been interviewed in it.

Mike Covel is a personable, regular-guy type of fellow, whose brainchild this documentary is, and who narrates it, interviewing a diverse range of humans (and mutton), to bring us a scary and infuriating message about ourselves and our financial security - or, rather, our lack of same. Throughout, however, and with emphasis at the end, he brings also a sound message of practical hope.

An implied theme is that financial markets are a normal part of life. Everybody buys, sells, and makes best-guesses about the future, whether at the supermarket, in yard sales, at our jobs, e-bay, the Kentucky Derby. Financial markets are specialized only for a particular form of profit-seeking, requiring specific tools and knowledge, in order to trade securities. Markets, though, being natural, obey natural laws, as unalterably as do tides, seasons or hurricanes, and bring their events unpredictably. To succeed in financial markets, as in life, means getting the odds in one's favor, as often as reasonably possible; and this takes work, diligence, and a willingness to second-guess emotions, fads and financial gurus.

The film is well-crafted, well-paced, therefore engaging to view. However, its documentary method seems not to need any fraudulent animations (no Al Gore melting polar bears), or whitewashing of media or politicians (Michael Moore in Cuba?), especially not fairy-tale hopes for Social Security. Superstar professional traders, average folk scratching lottery tickets, poker stars, ballplayers, a shepherd, diva models, street musicians, all seem authentic in their interviews with Michael Covel. Brief cuts to excerpts from TV and vintage movies, vistas of financial centers and sheep pastures, add color, warmth and irony to the visual sequences.

We're all awaiting producer/director/narrator Mike Covel's next documentary:  The Federal Reserve? Sovereign debt? The End of the Business Cycle?",1260921600,2,2301,5.449438202247191

If you're not a basketball player but rather an investor, trader or business person, the film Broke is the equivalent of the hypothetical dream team documentary. Amazingly if you are just in search of entertainment which also educates you more than business school can without you even knowing it, this film is perfect for you too.

Many of whom were original Market Wizards.  He starts with a basic question regarding the state of the economy and the investment game - so many of us want to get ahead, but why can't we?  He analyzes the current crisis but doesn't waste time trying to explain all the ""whys"" of the situation (enough people are already doing this).  He covers the effects, and points out there have always been booms and busts.

One of my favorite parts is his coverage of the state run lottery systems, where America spends around $50 billion annually on lottery games.  With the odds of these games in mind, Covel points out that we obviously do not understand numbers.  Furthermore, this government run lotteries are actually hidden taxes on the poor (the biggest buyers of lottery tickets).

The real gem in the video is he shows how the Jim Cramer's, CNBC's, etc. do not know what is going on.  Their business is to sell advertising by having the highest ratings.  Their system is to keep up the status quo, and from this angle it is impossible to get ahead.  BUT(!) he says there is a solution for all of us that want to get ahead, and that is trade or invest with a mathematical advantage, and to stop eating the crap that CNBC and company shovel out on a daily basis.

The interviews are the best part of this entire project.  Covel will interview normal everyday Americans about seemingly  everyday things, however, we will soon find out that we don't know as much about the system as we think.

Areal eye open as to how compainies would just write loans to anyone that signed there name on a piece of paper and could not afford to buy a gallon of milk.  He also does a great job in interviewing pro poker players, and comparing poker to trading.  It is a game of odds and in poker as in trading you need to know whaen to take a small loss and save your money for the next hand or trade.  Money management is the key to success in any undertaking and trading is one of them.  The single best part of the film is the actual interviews with many of the countries top traders that no one has ever heard of.

I worked for myself since the age of 14, right up until 25, then i went completely broke, had to take a job. HATED IT :D I packed it in because it was a waste of my time, I know I am best working for myself, wheeling and dealing and building up funds and investing/trading/speculating :D

What I think is particularly good about this film, is it kind of condenses tons of stuff I read from around aged 16-to my current age of 26. The key concepts, DONT' BE A SHEEP, be contrarian, follow trends, betting when have an edge etc.

The film shows in it's running time, key concepts needed to get out of a rat race and build towards financial freedom.

Michael points out that we are all taught to buy and hold even if that means to hold all the way down to zero. He also takes on the financial media for misleading people that theirs is the only way.

Human beings are psychologically geared towards consistently making irrational decisions and following crowds whether it be in real estate or technology stock bubbles.

They disregard conventional news media, and focud on one thing: price. Covel interviews several of these ""trend-followers"" and they divulge many keys to their successes.

He breaks down the use of probability theory and positive expected value very well, and links it to the game of poker vs the lottery.  He calls out the mainstream media (CNBC etc) on helping to fuel human emotions and confuse the general investing public.  I actually made my parents watch the film to help with my case as to why ""buy and hold"" is dead, and it worked.  Very well done.",1259625600,,594,4.221238938053097
3945317,5,B002L2I65G,"I've been trading for 24-years and its my life. I breathe it. I can't get enough of it. Part of my journey has been studying peers and there is no better way than listening to others. Broke is not only about trading, but its about the harsh reality of what goes in in people's minds and why one needs to avoid the herd instinct. Strongly recommend it.",1259625600,,351,4.253731343283582

8372340,2,B002L2I65G,"I'm well aware of what trend following is, but the topic is barely touched upon in this film. It's there, but it's like a gold nugget you have to dig for. I'm not sure why Michael decided to title this ""Michael Covel's Trend Following Film: Broke"". I don't think that is an accurate description of the movie. A more accurate title might have been something like ""Broke: You Can't Get Investment Advice from TV"". Bought the streaming version on Amazon but I'm thinking about asking for my money back. With the words 'Trend Following' in the title I was expecting a fair bit more information about trend following. Sorry Michael but the title is misleading.",1424044800,,655,4.7043478260869565
