8325321,4,B000KLQY9U,"I have been playing futsal for over 15 years including playing at national level. I was also coaching soocer team but not futsal teams. I am about to start my first futsal coaching job. As such, I was looking for a book that would provide me with additional insights into futsal and a variety of interesting futsal excercises to use in the trainings.

On the bad side: (1) Unfortunately, with my level of experience I could not find anything really new in the DVD. (2) Some of the contents of these DVD (the series) are overlapping - for example in this about 55 minutes DVD you will have at least 5-7 minutes of tactics for set plays which is already covered in the other part of the series. I think there would be about 25-30 exercises in this DVD which depending on your view might be enough or not. For met, there were maybe up to 5 that were interesting. (3) The starting about 5 minutes discuss playing with the goalkeeper in the offence - which although sometimes useful - is a marginal aspect of the game - so at the end you end up with about 35 minutes of material on this DVD.

On the good side: (1) The DVD is very well structured and gives really good overview of the futsal tactics. (2) The exercises and plays are very well illustrated both in the diagrams and with real players.

Overall, I think this is a really good introduction to futsal for anybody who has not coached futsal before and who wants to play/coach futsal at more than just beginners (or even intermediate) level. However, if you already have good futsal experience I doubt that the price of this DVD will justify the few things you will learn.",1250553600,2,1626,4.431438127090301

It really will improve players skills.
My players really enjoy doing those drills.",1196899200,,172,4.766666666666667
