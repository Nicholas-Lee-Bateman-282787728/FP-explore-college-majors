1205932,3,B00000F9YF,"Nevada City, 1941 film

In the 1860s a California railroad was built from the Pacific to the Sierras. Bandits and destruction were blamed on the railroad, the stage lines were their competitors. The film begins with a stagecoach chased by bandits. The stagecoach was wrecked. This pattern reoccurred again and again. A station was burned, the horses stolen. Was it Black Bart? The scene shifts to San Francisco, we see a horse-drawn trolley. The Steamboat Navigation company wants to put the competition out of business by getting the stage lines to fight with the railroads, this will allow them to win the lucrative shipping business. A stagecoach is passed by a wood-burning 4-4-0 steam engine. Mark Benton used to be a blacksmith and helps shoe a horse. The conversation is partly humorous. Jeff Conner was fired after a disagreement with Hank Liddel the owner. Jim Trevor meets Hank and tells him a sympathetic story to gain his friendship.

The `California Central' has been robbed, there is no money for payroll and expenses now. Jeff goes to work for the railroad, and Gabby Chapman too. Chick tells Jeff about the poetry for Jo. What is Jim doing there? Jim got a coded message by telegraph. Will they hold up the train when it stops for fuel? Will Jeff and Gabby be wrongfully accused of working with Black Bart? ""You fellows live here?"" The head of the steamboat company instructs Black Bart how to sabotage the railroad so it won't get a government subsidy. Can they stop the destruction of the train tunnel? [Note the wooden railroad cars.] Can a signal fire stop the train? Not with Black Bart at the throttle. Can Jeff stop the train so its blasting powder doesn't destroy the tunnel? He will try, and does. The burning fuse is removed, Jeff captures the leader so they surrender. The railroad tunnel is saved. Amos Norton is captured. Liddel and Benton make their peace. Jo and Jeff will go to the Opera House.

The competition between stage lines (best for local transportation) and the railroad (best for long distances and heavy loads) is seldom mentioned in schoolbooks. These little-known facts provide the background for this drama. Canals preceded the railroads, but are dependent on level country with a water supply. Canals provide the lowest costs for bulk goods that don't need rapid transportation.",1290988800,,2326,4.898477157360406
1205933,1,B00000F9YF,"""Nevada City"" was filmed in a visual aspect of 1.33:1, as were all TV films and programs of the time.  This shady outfit offers you a version that's 16:9.  Now, how do you suppose they did that?  There's 2 ways and either one is a mutilation of the original film.

First, you can cut off the top and bottom of each frame.  This is the way many ""widescreen"" films were made immediately after 1953.  Converting to 16:9 will lose about 1/3 of the image.  You want to pay full price for only 2/3 of the film?

Second, you can expand the image to the widescreen aspect.  This means everyone and everything is bloated.  Try it yourself:  while watching anything that's 1.33:1, use your controller to convert the screen to the wide aspect.  If you like what you see -- say, Humphry Bogart looking like Sidney Greenstreet -- then maybe this travesty is for you -- assuming they didn't just chop it to pieces.

Please note they don't even bother to tell you how they do the deed.  They don't want you to find out how they butchered this film.  These people are not doing you a service.  They're trying to capitalize on the widespread and utterly stupid fear of black bars on the TV screen.  ""This picture has been modified to fit your screen.""  What a bunch of irrational hogwash.  If you're afraid of black bars, maybe TV isn't for you.  There's always radio:  it ALWAYS fits your screen.",1269820800,,1380,4.461847389558233
