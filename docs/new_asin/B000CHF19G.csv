8462194,2,B000CHF19G,"On the Bio Channel on TV, you're given a full biography about the person/people they're telling you about. For some reason this DVD focuses around The Tony Danza Show and all the promotions that went into getting it on TV. Being a huge Who's the Boss fan, I was expecting a lot more to revolve around THAT show and the actors and actresses that starred on it. If I had known what this DVD was really about--his talk show--I would have skipped it. You watch the Bio channel to learn about the person--their childhood, how they got into acting, what their colleagues think about them, their acting career. You don't want to focus on such a small part of the person's life, especially when there were so much better thing they could have zeroed in on. They barely mentioned Who's the Boss at all. I was disappointed. I don't recommend this DVD at all.",1301529600,4,848,4.512987012987013
