Doctor Zhivago
Keira Knightley (Lara) states in the bonus interview, it's too good a story and today's generation won't pick up a 3-4 decade old film to view. So the Brit TV miniseries became as classic as the book and 1965 film. This miniseries focuses on characters more than the politics. Lara is a young girl with an awakening sensuality, who's loved by 3 men, whom she returns love in a form with each. First lover, Komarovsky (Sam Neill) also used her Lara's mom. Lara married Pasha, revolutionist. Truest love seemed to be Dr. Yury (Hans Matheson) also poet. Yury also loves his wife, sibling Tonya, creating his own triangle affair. Yury's best friend, Misha, loves Tonya too. It is the conflict between relationships, and how that conflicts with a Bolshevik uprising, that drives this Boris Pasternak book adaptation. The miniseries begins in 1897 and ends about 1922. A nude teenage star, Knightley, makes this adult fare.

Lillie
A Masterpiece Theatre rendition of the life of Lillie Langtry, wild girl, mistress of the Duke of Wales, photographed and painted, and rendered herself scandalous in the society of the times. Victorian authenticity in costume and sets with superb acting led by Lillie (Francesca Annis) and Peter Egan plays Oscar Wilde who really was befriended by Lillie in real life. It is way beyond historical dramatic biography. It gives viewers a look into the person of Lillie, into the flamboyant life, the actress role, and scandal, sex, and Lillie's love affairs. It's romantic fast-pace action, of a sort. Well done in all ways. A good choice in a classic set.

Lost Empires
Some say ""Lost Empires"" is not Colin Firth's greatest performance, since he appears naive, bashful, unsure, a fresh romantic, coy, fickle. It's not like his romantic leads. Wait! But backward, boyishness, hormones raging, is exactly the Richard Herncastle character the author, J.B. Priestley, created. Firth's been good from the beginning.
John Castle (in one of his best leading roles) is Uncle Nick, Indian illusionist Ganga Dun, who helps Richard after both parents die. Cissie (Gillian Bevan-so well acted it made her career start) is part of the magic act. Sexy gals involved are: shed-her-clothes Julie (Carmen Du Sautoy-`Dance to the Music of Time'); sexy/saucy Nancy (Beatie Edney-`Miss Pettigrew'); flirt Nonie (Francesca McGregor); deviant Lily (Pamela Stephenson); and more. Fine acting in a story about the stage, excellent filming, costumes, Ragtime music, and sets; all it takes to make it a classic worthy of watching multiple times.

Upstairs Downstairs Series 1
Easy to call this one of the most celebrated British costume dramas ever crated. The stars are so numerous there no way to begin, and spin-off series as well. And after decades, it came back. If you've never watched a UK period drama, this is the place to start. It has it all, and some of the best TV writing ever done on that side of the Atlantic. Guest stars begged to be included. Members of the elite Upstairs Bellamy family seemed to be come as close to the viewer, emotionally, family-like, as what happened with the Downstairs group of cast members, those spending life working, like most of us have to do. It is a saga, a family of means whose lives become entangled socially, politically, and romantically. The downstairs family must keep their place, assist the wealthy that they serve to overcome hardships, without fanfare, even as they have their own hardships and joys to celebrate or despair within. It's an emotional series. Great...classic. The only downfall to this set is the fact you receive only Series 1. I'll guarantee after watching one, you will be buying the complete anniversary set of Upstairs Downstairs. Then the 3 episodes produced four decades later. It's that good.

The Documentary
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-of-the-Costume-Drama/dp/B007TSV4II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story of the Costume Drama</a>
Entertaining informative 5-episode docu- series about UK miniseries. All costume genres, romance to war. Star interviews. Feature clips. Behind-the-scenes, like a mini-series of bonus material that is a history book of the UK TV costume drama existence. This DVD's as astounding as the drama epics themselves. Keeley Hawes (Upstairs, Downstairs) narrates all 5 episodes, but you hear directly from stars, writers, & directors. Hours of footage behind and in front of the lens. I've watched dozens of the covered epics, but found 19 `new to me' and likely future purchases.
