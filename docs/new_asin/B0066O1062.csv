8494167,5,B0066O1062,"Top Notch Grade A++, A well balanced story with characters that you could relate to and laugh with as their life unfolds in this anime. The anime is light-hearted with a well balanced blend of comedy and drama. The artists and writers really thought everything through to bring this story and its characters to life for the viewers.",1462924800,,332,4.741379310344827

No robots, space ships or demons here (although a creative use of an aluminum baseball bat does offer some recurring humor). Just simple and sweet fun.",1392422400,,341,4.666666666666667
8494170,4,B0066O1062,"I saw a clip on Youtube and decided to buy the thing, since I couldn't find it on the internet. I went to watch it and like it. Unfortunately, it is subbed, I usually like shows when they're dub, so I don't have to sometimes pause the thing and read the subtitles. But overall, it's a good show.",1389657600,,295,4.103448275862069
8494171,4,B0066O1062,"Have you watched K-ON?  Hidamari Sketch? Azumanga Diaoh?  Lucky Star?  If so and if you enjoyed them, you will likely enjoy this series.  Drawing heavily from those sources, A Channel will feel comfortable and familiar.  A good example is a listing of the characters(note, spelling is as in the DVD subtitles, there seems to be some disagreement on the internets as to the proper spelling for a couple names):

Toru:  Toru is a year younger than the other 3 girls, and arguably the closest to a singular main character.  Has bits of Konota from Lucky Star(short, skinny and not happy about it), Ui from K-ON.  She has a somewhat ambiguous relationship with Run.  She is either close best friends, or girlfriend in the romantic sense(though maybe one sides). The ambiguity is intentional and never resolved, nor does it need to be.  She guards and protects Run, sometimes to hilarious degrees, but Run frequently needs that protection.  She is voiced somewhat awesomely by Aoi Yuuki who has gotten somewhat famous due to voicing the title character in a little show called Puella Magi Madoka Magicka), who is also somewhat short and thin.

Run:  the object of Toru's affection, she will feel very familiar to those who have watched K-ON(Yui), Azumanga Diaoh(Osaka), Lucky Star(Tsukasa...her voice acress, Kaori Fukuhara in fact did Tsukasa's voice as well).  Ditzy, short attention span, happy go lucky.  She is not really dumb, she simply does not view the world as others do.  She depends on and is incredibly affectionate towards Toru.  It is hard not to smile when she is onscreen.

Yuki:  Almost a clone in looks and personality of Mio from K-(ON), though her voice actress is Minako Kotobuki(who as an aside is drop dead gorgeous), who did the voice of Tsumugi in K-ON.  Has a Kansai accent, but it seems to fade noticeably to my ear(note that I am not Japanese, can't speak much Japanese, and have never been to Japan, so take my ear for what it is worth), is tall, slender, large chested, long hair, mild mannered, and easily frightened.  Did I mention she is just like Mio?

Nagi:  Cross Nodoka from K-On with Yomi from Azumanga Diaoh and you have Nagi(short for Nagisa).  Closer to Nodoka in appearance, Yomi in personality.  She is a glasses wearing smart girl who takes things seriously and is worried about her weight.  Her voice actress is Yumi Uchiyama who I am unfamiliar with but did a great job here.

Like most shows of this sort, nothing much really happens, each episode simply telling of some incident or 2 in the lives of the girls.  The show emphasizes cuteness over conflict and humor over everything.  There is nothing original or thought provoking here, but it will make you feel good watching it.  I am glad I did.

The extra's include textless closing song, 4 video clips of the voice actresses talking and goofing around, and most notably, a bunch of short(2 to 6 minute) mini episodes, some of which are pure awesome.  Video and audio where good.  No dub, subtitles where good and included a good number of explanations of some of the culture specific references.",1353024000,,3093,4.784499054820416
8494172,5,B0066O1062,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series; it is kind of like a cross between K-On and Azumanga Daioh, except that the characters are not musicians!

The series follows the life and friendship of four high-school girls; Run, Toru, Nagi and Yuko (as seen from left to right in the cover picture). Run and Toru have been best friends since forever, and Toru thinks of Run as her big sister; Toru is one year behind the other three, and very small for her age (she is 15, and describes herself as 'scrawny'; indeed, she is so skinny, her thigh-highs regularly fall down), but she is feisty, cute as a button (she even has a 'fan club', set up without her knowledge by her classmates, who all want to take turns hugging her!), and a top student in academic terms. She also has a cute kitten called 'Carbonation' (Lit. 'Tansan'; Japanese for 'carbonic acid', used in fizzy drinks); you'll have to watch the series to find out why he is called that. Run is totally bonkers, but cute and harmless - she comes across as being a mixture of Yui and Ritsu from K-On. She is so scatter-brained, she even manages to forget to put on her underwear and one sock one day! One episode includes Run's attempts to find a suitable swim-suit for Toru, so they can go to the beach, but even the smallest are too big for her, so she winds up with a child's one. Next is Nagi, who is bespectacled, red-headed and cute; she is also a good student, but has a hang-up about her weight, although she is not fat at all; she feels guilty whenever she eats cake or desserts. She is envious of Toru, who eats like a horse but never gains any weight. Lastly is Yuko, who is a dead ringer for Mio from K-On; she looks like her, sounds like her, and is even a scaredy-cat like Mio. She is beautiful, has a great figure (much to the envy of the other three; indeed, Toru (who is flat-chested) is so fascinated with Yuko's E-cup boobs, she is known to occasionally bounce them, much to Yuko's dismay!) Yuko is also the token 'Kansai'-accented character (a southern accent, generally portrayed in Japanese stories as country folk or 'hicks').

There is no magic, no special powers, time travel, or big battles (unless you count Toru fighting boys off with a baseball bat, when she thinks they are harassing Run!); just day-to-day, slice of life stuff, but it is charming, cute, funny and totally good fun. There is also not a single panty-shot in the whole series (unless you count the inevitable swim-suits, and sports shorts known as 'bloomers'!). If you look at the 'Extras' (which are on a separate disc) you will see that the character actors who voice the four girls are even more bonkers and crazy (in a nice way!) than the characters they portray! Overall, I loved this set!

The Amazon description is wrong in that it says the aspect ratio is 4:3 (1.333-1); it isn't - it is 16:9 (1.78-1).",1343779200,6,2851,4.5
8494173,4,B0066O1062,"A Channel is just a great Anime. Its hard to pin down what really makes you like, but you'll like it if you enjoy having fun. Sometimes the comedy will run dry, but it all made up with some sort of cute scene. If you like Slice-of-Life and Cute-girls-Doing-cute-things then it'd be a great buy. If your not into that kind of stuff then I says its okay if you wanna burn 6 hours watching an anime that you may be able to relate to your own high school experience.",1336780800,2,462,4.144444444444445
8494174,5,B0066O1062,"Tohru is an introverted girl who has had one best friend for as long as she can remember.  Her friend, Run-chan, is older than her and went to middle school a little sooner.  When the series begins, they are finally reunited, but Tohru finds out that Run as become close to two other girls.  Now Tohru is faced with a difficult decision.  Become part of a larger social clique, or chase Mugi and Yuko off with a baseball bat.

This is funny and cute.  It sometimes flows like a number of newspaper strip panels forming a loosely connected story.  I'd say it's good for fans of K-on, Azumanga Daioh, and Charlie Brown.

Tohru is a quiet loll with a dark sense of humour.  What redeems her dark streak is her obvious affection for Run (It's so obvious, the creators might be trying to bait fan fiction writers.)  Tohru looks young for her actual age.  Sometimes Tohru becomes depressed, thinking the the slightly older Run will eventually outgrow her.  This is the closest the show has to a main conflict.  Whenever this gets too serious we are reminded that Run is a ditzy character bound to mature far slower than Tohru anyway.

Mugi is the glasses wearing, girl who thinks she's plain, and constantly worries about her weight.  Yoku is the hot girl who doesn't know she's hot.  She plays off Mugi well.  Yoku is also a scaredy cat, think Mio from K-on.

Overall it's a moe series that will make you laugh a few times every episode.",1334361600,9,1432,4.505836575875486
