1079391,4,6305808058,"Fans of ""Vampirella"" magazine and ""Hammer"" films will apreciate this gem. It is a little like ""Fearless Vampire Killers"" (the same guy is playing Dracula)in it's lighthearted comedic approach to a tale of an American actress whom inherits a castle in Transylvania that is still occupied by her undead/unclothed grandmother. I loved it!-Dave Grant",1202688000,,346,5.425925925925926
1079392,4,6305808058,"A typical plot device has an American heiress arrive in Europe to look over an old castle she has inherited.  The help is surprised when she arrives as she looks just like her grandmother who was supposedly a vampire.  When trying to prove that vampires don't really exist, the new Countess accidently releases her vampire ancestor.  Now with two look-alikes running around the confusion begins to build.

But with the vampire released, bodies begin to pile up.  A monastery and a religious school offer up plenty of targets for the hungry vampire.  Soon more vampires are running around.  But attempts to eliminate the vampire seem to fail as no one can tell which is which.  Eventually we get other vampires and even Count Dracula drops in for a visit.  Soon it seems like the vampires are completely out of control but being a double does have its uses.

Slightly reminiscent of The Fearless Vampire Killers this film also uses a lot of humor and slapstick in its makeup.  But unlike the Polanski film, these vampires are quite debauched.  Living and undead seem to spend an awful lot of time running around topless.  So much so that one wonders why this is not billed as some sort of nudie-cutie film.  But whatever the reason, this film works.  The blend of humor and horror is done just right.  Both female leads are played by the same actress (the director's wife) so the deceptions work very well.  I was expecting something a little less commendable but was pleasantly surprised.  Check it out.",1147046400,5,1503,4.737451737451737
1079393,4,6305808058,"Woo-hoo! Now, this is a classic! Yep, young, beautiful Betty Williams (Pia Degermark), international movie goddess has just returned to her ancestral home via Transylvania airlines. Upon arrival at the castle, Betty learns of the grim fate of her grandma, baroness Catali. It seems she was found in bed, naked, with two bitemarks on her neck. Luckily, granny is in the castle crypt, sealed in a coffin. Of course, she's a vampire, so the last few centuries have been VERY good to the old gal! The baroness (Pia Degermark again) gets up and starts hunting unsuspecting victims at the monastary next door. One particular monk ends up at the wrong end of her fangs and becomes one of the most annoying bloodsuckers ever filmed. He soon creeps (more like stumbles) into the nearby girl's school (on the other side of the castle) and feasts upon a sleeping, naked student. Soon, the vampires are all revved up and ready to party! Count Dracula himself shows up as guest of honor at the wild flesh-feast, where most of the babes are topless! Hot diggety! THE VAMPIRE HAPPENING is a goofy, inept monster comedy that has just enough nudity to (almost) make up for it's lack of a decent script. I recommend it as a triple feature with VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY and INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS (GRAVEYARD TRAMPS)...",1103673600,2,1297,4.743362831858407
1079394,2,6305808058,"Beautiful sets, lights, props and music were marred by English dubbing.  For Heaven's sake, I bought this because the title was in German, but when Amazon.com sent it to me, all of the German had been dubbed over, and there wasn't even any German in the subtitles.  ""Gebissen wird nur nachts,"" of course, means ""Bites happen only at night"" (one of those typical impersonal passive constructions that First Year German students run into) or ""You only get bitten at night.""  Anyway, the four color printed cover that came on this DVD was pretty good, as English goes (""The Vampire Happening""), but it wasn't what I expected.  It wasn't until I opened up the DVD that I found the slip of paper (with cute little cartoon bats flying around) with the original title - 'Gebissen wird nur nachts' - but where on earth did the German go?  Why was this dubbed into English?  Now, that said, this is not a total disappointment.  It is what you would call 'soft-R' and not even 'soft-core.'  A couple of scantily clad vampiresses are seen, and the plot was easy enough to follow.  What I was struck with most with this film was the Disney-ish sound-track, a little more bouncy than ""sound of music"" but enough to remind me of the 1960's.  If you are only into rap music, or rock, this soundtrack will probably strike you as rather lame.  I think most of the value behind this DVD rests in what lessons it teaches the film student who looks at it from the perspective of how to put a movie together.  It's a good enough movie if you can get past the English, which proceeds at odds with the movement of the lips of the actors.  Sigh.  Film collectors that want to follow the career of Pia Degermark might also find this movie valuable.  But beware, ordering ""Gebissen wird nachts"" means getting ""The Vampire Happening"" when the DVD finally arrives in your mailbox.  And there were no menu choices that you could click to turn on any German, not even German subtitling.  I sure hope that ordering ""Der Blaue Engel"" or ""Kleider Machen Leute"" doesn't mean getting ""The Blue Angel"" or ""Clothes Make the Man"" when the DVD finally arrives in the mailbox.",994291200,3,2136,4.593667546174142

7895488,3,6305808058,"""The Vampire Happening"" is a West German horror/comedy from 1971 (the German title can roughly be translated as ""You Only Get Bitten at Night""). The beautiful Pia Degermark plays a double role as an American actress who inherits a castle in Transylvania and discovers that her grandmother is a vampire who looks just like her, albeit raven-haired, also played by Pia. Some of the inhabitants of a nearby monastery and girl's school join the ranks of the undead and the vampires throw a helluva costume party where Dracula shows up.

The movie combines elements of ""Kiss of the Vampire"" (1963) and ""The Devil's Nightmare"" (1971) with the zaniness of ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967). It's a fun romp and not supposed to be taken seriously; anyone offended by its irreverence needs to visit the psyche ward.

Highlights include Ms. Degermark's amazing beauty. Pia was married to the producer at the time and was a promising starlet; she previously won awards at Cannes (Best Actress) and the Golden Globes (Most Promising Female Newcomer). Not that I care about such awards; I just want to establish Pia's promising career at the time. Unfortunately, this was her final film -- of only four -- and she divorced the producer a couple years later, falling into anorexia, poverty, fraud and prison in the later 70s. How the mighty have fallen! But, thankfully, I heard she later got her life back on track. In any event, she was in her prime in this movie and does an impressive job in the dual role; in fact, she easily carries the film.

Actually, there are quite a few good-lookin' women on display here, but their portrayal is too one-dimensional.

The film was directed by Freddie Francis, an Oscar-winning cinematographer, known for such quality films as ""Glory,"" ""Cape Fear"" (1991), ""The Elephant Man,"" ""The Creeping Flesh"" and ""Dracula has Risen from the Grave,"" but also lesser films (to be nice) like the infamous ""Trog."" I point this out to stress that this is not some amateur production, although you might think it is since it's such an obscure public domain film, featured on numerous cheap DVDs.

""The Vampire Happening"" plays out like a spoof of Hammer's vampire flicks. As such, there's quite a bit to appreciate here if you're in the mood for a horror sex comedy. The problem is that the story's not all that compelling and it meanders along.

Also, I found the depiction of the Roman monastery and monks to be interesting. Is this what people think Christianity really is? Dull, sterile men wearing drab robes swearing off sex and marriage, utterly appalled by any depiction of nudity, sex or sexuality? I guess they never seriously examined the Song of Songs in their studies (or much of the rest of the Bible, for that matter). What an absurd and erroneous depiction of Christianity, and I'm not blaming the filmmakers, but rather the idiotic religious spirit and sterile organizations that foster such a depiction.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot at Castle Kreuzenstein, Austria.

FINAL WORD: Although ""The Vampire Happening"" is a Euro-trash horror sex comedy, it's a fun film if you're in the right mode. It amusingly spoofs Hammer's vampire flicks and features a strong protagonist/antagonist performance by Pia Degermark. On the downside, it's a little overlong and the story's too meandering to be wholly engaging, not to mention they drop the ball with the women by being too one-dimensional.

7895492,5,6305808058,"An American actress inherits a Transylvanian castle, which she visits before selling, but decides to stay. She learns she is the descendant of a unique ""blood"" line while being introduced to the history of the castle, including the torture chamber, in which resides a portrait of her grandmother, which looks remarkably like herself. Upon learning of her sexual exploits, remarks ""You go, grandma!"" {replicated verbatim in 'Elvira's Haunted Hills'}.

As it so fortuitously happens, there is a monestary across the way, a veritable feeding ground, which she decides to follow in her descendant's footsteps and prey thereof, beginning with a particularly righteous monk who sees ""the Dark Lord's influence"" in everything from trees to statues - obvious expressions of his repressed libido, until finally freed of his lustful suffocation by the newly resident Countess; although the gothically gorgeous original hostess of the castle rises to claim her sanguinous prize, causing confusion amongst the resident crusadering butler at every turn, being veritable twins. She also sinks her fangs into the peeping-tom Abbot, who periodically enjoys the sights of the Cathoic school girls with their secret boyfriends adjacent to the perish.

Finally, a party, or ""happening"" is scheduled, in which vampiric relations are invited from all over the region, culminating in a delightful orgiastic party wherein all invited indulge in all manner of delightful carnal delights, from libations to fumigation, to lustful repartee. Finally, Count Dracula arrives in a hellicopter, complete with bat insignia, who gesticulates the Cornu both upon arrival, and introduction to the vampire masquerade ball {The Devil as a Gentleman}, who enjoys a special treat of the company of four pretties for his pleasure in a private chamber.

One of Countess Clairmonde's mortal lovers 'Jens' {a teacher seduced from his puritanical ways} is talked into an anti-vampire crusade by the butler, who then seek out to infiltrate the party posing as vampires themselves, but are eventually weeded out and flee near sunrise - seems 'Jens' cannot bear the notion of destroying the vampiric beauty}, where the Countess is loaded into a coffin bound for Hollywood, wherein posing as the actress, begins her predation anew.

Overall, an amusing film filled with succulent sights, nubile flesh, fetishistic delights, and diabolical smirks along the way.",1381622400,,2412,5.458445040214477
