Now as far as the techniques, theory, flow of the drills/excersises, this DVD is very good and it provided of a variety of camera angles so that you can see Mr. Petrilli movements and how he is able to execute the variety of disarms, vines, snakes, and strips.  These are all classic and good examples of the FMA (filipino martial arts) and I think to get a sense of or have some ideas as to how one might deal with a stick-armed assilant, this video as some options that one can explore.  Being an FMA practitioner myself for a time and coming from this type of training where the stick IS treated as a bladed weapons (i.e. matchette, knife, broken beer bottle, small hand axe,) then one may want to re-consider the viability of the techniques shown in this DVD.  For example, some of the forehand strikes that may come towards you with a stick, one would have to respond very differently when a person is attacking you with a bladed weapon (matchette or a hand axe)
  However, and to be fair in regards to the instructor and the material shown, know that that 1.)  your opponent (the one on the street who is trying to harm/hurt/maim/kill you won't allow you to just do the 3 or 4 disarm drills as they stand there in front of you. 2.) As I mentioned a few moments ago, dealing with bladed weapons as opposed to impact weapons requires a very different technique which I did not find in these DVD's.
  Again, in my opinion the material presented here is excellent as reference material and conceptual ideas that would challange you to think in a very different way about attacks that may come with a stick, and perhaps allow you to synthesize or formulate some counter-offensive movements and strikes that can add to your 'tool box' of martial and street wise technique.",1381795200,2,1864,4.523809523809524
8397462,4,B003ILJX7Y,"Well presented by a good teacher, very good material in the vein of Mr. Cucci. Somewhat rare filipino barehand, I like the low ranges they include and nice finishes, also the foot traps. All in all a very good system.",1373328000,2,217,4.45
8397463,5,B003ILJX7Y,"This is a great example of combat jujutsu, Filipino style.  Pangamot is the culmination of several styles blended over time by the Cebuano and Moro natives in the Philippines. As Cacoy Canete used to say, ""you could learn jujutsu, judo, and aikido in the Philippines up until about 4th degree black belt; after that you had to travel to Japan.""

Cacoy (Supreme Grandmaster Canete by this writing), and others trained in the local Japanese schools while simultaneously training in stick fighting and boxing. Cacoy operated a judo / jujutsu dojo / eskrima academy before formally defining Pangamot in 1980.  Over time, Cebuano practitioners modified the jujutsu techniques to become more street effective against local weapons, namely, knives, 20""-30"" sticks, and homemade short swords.

This is why I recommended it to law enforcement.  If you use a baton, must walk people before cuffing them, enter homes where you must speak with people in close quarters while others may enter from side rooms, the techniques in this video will be very helpful in the event of an attack.  They are taught from the close range as though you are engaged in conversation or attempting to secure control over someone as they attack.  In other words, you cannot use your firearm or taser because they resist or attack when you are practically touching them.  This is almost all crafted to take down an aggressor who has attacked with strikes from close range, when you do not have much space.

If you are an MMA practitioner, use this to augment your fighting style with street-ready, close-quarter, blows and throws.  If you cannot sprawl when you are attacked, what will you do?  This offers effective options. You will increase your awareness of weapons and how your sport game might make you vulnerable to weapon attack in some environments.  This is jujutsu crafted to defend a small weapon threat in a confined area.  Let's hope none of us end up in a situation where this is needed but, hey, its fun to practice.",1367971200,3,2000,4.899109792284866
8397464,4,B003ILJX7Y,"Secrets of Pangamot is indeed an enlightening piece of work for those students who know the basics and want some ""out of the box"" ideas on how they can be better at finding holes in their opponents defenses using locks, compressions and other associated defensive skills using Kali. The purpose of this video in my opinion is to open the advanced students eyes to the idea that Kali's basic lock system is only the beginning and that potentially, endless combinations for attack exist.

For the more amateur student, these videos will not be at your level yet as much of what's talked about here assumes you've got a firm knowledge of the basics. For the beginner, Remy Presas offers some good training and Bob Orlando's Silat training can be enlightening as he glances over Silat basics, which are similar to Kali's training principles.",1267920000,5,837,4.853146853146853
