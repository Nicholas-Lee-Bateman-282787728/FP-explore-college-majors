8613976,5,B00FB34B8I,Not Bad for a Mamie Van Doren Film. She looks amazing and her acting is above par! June wilkinson is unwatchable!,1432512000,,113,4.428571428571429
8613977,3,B00FB34B8I,"I'll echo J. Nixon (""Snore"").  But first, a big caveat:

I wholeheartedly applaud Vinegar Syndrome for unearthing such rarities from the '50s and '60s in such pristine condition.  Kudos, guys... Please do keep it up.

That said... OK, these two movies are indeed snoozers.  Too much talk, too little action.  There is indeed such a thing as a movie being ""deservedly obscure.""

But hey!  You've got to be prepared for a little disappointment when watching a virtually unknown rarity.

Some notes about each movie:

""The Candidate"" (not to be confused of course with the somewhat superior 1972 Robert Redford vehicle) was photographed by Stanley Cortez, whose heights included filming ""Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and whose fairly many lows included this title and ""The Doomsday Machine"" (1972).  The best actor in it by far is (a relatively restrained) Ted Knight, RIP.

""Johnny Gunman"" features some young versions of faces that would become familiar in '70s movies and TV shows.  A penultimate knife fight features music familiar to fans of ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"" (which this pre-dated by at least two years).

Worth a look for rare-B&W-film connoisseurs.",1385942400,,1164,5.122340425531915
8613978,5,B00FB34B8I,The Candidate also known as Party Girls For The Candidate is a 1964 film starring the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren. The double entendres are very funny and she tosses them off with ease. At the time this was released in art houses and was considered an adults only film. Mamie looks great and does a sexy twist number you won't soon forget ! It is nice to see one of her rare films released on DVD. Hopefully there will be more to follow. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her for her stands on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars from the golden age of Hollywood.,1385251200,5,614,4.082644628099174
8613979,2,B00FB34B8I,"Expected more. Both films commit the ultimate crime...being boring. The bombshell leads in Candidate still well clothed and Ted Knight, (bless his heart and soul) was not a good enough actor to carry off this film that slogs along. The abortion scene would have been considered highly controversial in 1964, not now and the rest of the films dramatic points are played with too much melodrama making them unintentionally funny.  Johnny Gunman is a story of two rival gangsters who decided to talk out their problems (off screen). The female protagonist is uninteresting and doesn't act very well either;. I love ""bad: movies, hate boring ones.",1384646400,,643,5.066037735849057
