2604142,5,B000GB5MD8,"I have been using Kathy Smith workouts for about 10 years now.  I LOVE the Fat Burning workout. I have the VHS tape, and was afraid it was going to wear out, so I was so glad to find the DVD!! I have done the Winning Workout also which is great, but it's more high impact than the Fat Burning workout.  I got married 2 years ago, and really slacked off on working out, and gained about 25 pounds.  I have been doing the Fat Burning workout and the Lift Weights to Lose Weight for almost a week now, and I can already tell a difference in my body.  I definitely recommend this DVD. It will get you into great shape in a small amount of time.",1310601600,3,640,4.015748031496063
2604143,5,B000GB5MD8,"My mom had been doing the ""Fat Burning Workout"" since 1989 when it came out, and her VHS was getting worn out. I saw this and immediately bought it for her. It was cheap, and she has a couple more workouts now, too. (I'm sure the one is still her favorite, though) Now she has a higher quality copy on DVD.",1207440000,5,306,4.032786885245901
2604144,5,B000GB5MD8,"These old ""tapes"" are the best.  I was just saying last night how I wish I could have transferred them onto DVD.  I thought I'd see what was available and here they are.  I did these workouts 4 times a week, cut back on calories and subsequently lost 50 pounds. Kathy Smith is truly incredible.  I have some of the newer tapes but this ""tried and true"" is the best.  Once you get used to the routine, you do it before Kathy does. I can truly say that these workouts put me in the best shape of my life!",1206748800,6,502,4.03030303030303
2604145,5,B000GB5MD8,I was so excited to see this on DVD.  I had the old fat burning workout on cassette and it was so worn that I could hardly make it out.  The DVD is great!,1185494400,3,154,3.5
2604146,1,B000GB5MD8,"I have been working out with videos 5-6 times per week for 5 years now and own a collection of over 20 videos.  This video is too hard to follow.  Ms. Smith does a poor job of explaining the moves and doesn't give any cues as to when you should get ready for the next exercise.  Since you are often in a position where you can't see the TV, the video should have verbal explanations of what is going on but it does not.  I find it very hard to know what I am supposed to be doing without constantly interrupting my workout to watch the video.  Can't recommend this one.",1174867200,6,569,4.09009009009009
2604147,4,B000GB5MD8,"I only gave this DVD 4 stars because I really don't like the first two workouts on the disc. Both Body Basics and Winning Workout are hard for beginners like me. There's a lot of high impact moves which can be hard on the knees and ankles. Plus Kathy moves very quickly from one exercise to another without warning making it hard to follow. However, I LOVE the last workout on this disc, Fat Burning Workout. An old roommate of mine has the VHS years ago and I remember doing it with great results! I was so excited when I found the same workout on this DVD. It really does help you slim down quickly! Kathy also gives modified versions of some of the harder exercises for beginners which I appreciate. I'm also happy to say that this workout is easier to follow than the first two workouts on the disc. Her workouts definitely improved with time.",1170028800,12,847,4.401273885350318
2604148,5,B000GB5MD8,"I used Kathy's Fat burning and cardio/toning 17 years ago to lose weight after my first child.  Alternating them for six days and 'resting' on Sunday and all the weight came off FAST!!  I was in better shape than before my pregnancy.

Nearly two decades later, these workouts are as effective as I'd remembered.  I didn't have the weight to lose, but wanted to get back in shape and tone up what gravity was pulling on.  I found this and cheered.

Sure enough, it's working again.  Fun, effective routines that have you wanting to exercise.

Talk about Time-tested!

Thank you, Kathy Smith!",1168214400,15,590,4.705882352941177
2604149,5,B000GB5MD8,"I love Kathy Smith and for over 15 years she has been the only fitness instructor that provides videos that I can follow expertly and use as a daily way of life to stay fit and motivated.

There is no one else like Kathy.  I love that being a fitness trainer was her profession before doing her videos so you are getting the real deal here.  And she does motivate and educate with each video she does.

I had been using her FAT BURNING WORKOUT on vhs for well over 15 years and last month my video machine ate the tape.  I was devastated.  I imediately went into Amazon and to my amazement it had just been released on dvd with 2 other excellent previous videos the month before.

I had it shipped immediately and my wonderful routine is now fully intact.  The picture and sound quality are excellent.  Don't look any further than Kathy Smith. If you follow her example, directions and stay true to your routine - you will have results that will last.

A+++ for putting her old videos on dvd at such a reasonable price.",1162166400,27,1019,4.343915343915344
2604150,5,B000GB5MD8,I had the classic in the 80s and was so happy to find it in this set on DVD recently. It's just a tried and true set of exercises that anyone cam do and get results!,1391644800,,165,3.611111111111111
2604151,4,B000GB5MD8,"This collection was released again in 2013 in Kathy's Timeless collection with a different cover photo, so one needs to be careful not to purchase both of them. That said, I have already reviewed the 2013 edition, and am repeating that review here.

I discovered Kathy Smith's videos in the late 1980s when I was in my early-forties. I'm now in my mid-sixties and still work out to her and others' videos. I once owned all three of the workouts featured in this video. The ""Fat-Burning"" video was an all-time favorite of mine; I literally wore it out after about six years of playing it. I still love it today, can still do it, and am so glad to have it again on DVD. As for the other two workouts on this DVD, ""Body Basics"" was not a favorite of mine back in the '80s, but I have gained a new appreciation of it today. The floor work--especially for the legs--is terrific!

The ""Winning Workout"" is okay, but even in the old days I found the weight-lifting portion too convoluted, with all its graduated phases. Plus, it moves too fast for me. Kathy has newer videos that offer far better weight-training segments in my opinion. So, now that I'm twenty years older, I have even less reason to revisit the Winning Workout, and probably won't.

In my opinion, it is the Fat-Burning workout that makes this DVD worth the money. Looking back, I think it was Kathy Smith's first mature video. She dropped the Farrah Fawcett image that characterized both Body Basics and the Winning Workout. Instead, she appears in this as a more athletic, health-conscious Kathy, sporting a practical pony tail and no longer wearing pantyhose under her leotard. To me, she even looks more muscular. Also, 25 minutes of aerobics was expanded to 40 minutes. No floor work, but lots of aerobics, and at a slower, exceptionally well-queued pace.

In sum, I would say this DVD offers one great workout (Fat Burning), one good one (Body Basics), and one okay one (Winning Workout) It's well worth the price; plus, it's fun to have a blast from the past, complete with purple, hot pink, and green colors all combined in the same outfit.",1377043200,3,2109,4.6310160427807485
2604152,3,B000GB5MD8,"This DVD was just okay... I rented this from the library and did it last night.  I am in average pyshical shape and I am sore today - I feel like I had a good workout.  It's not too intense but it definitely gets the job done.  However, I can't recommend this DVD.  The majority of the aerobics workouts are way too difficult to follow, unless you have practice dancing.  She does a lot of crazy footwork with little to no explanation so I spent a lot of the time just trying to figure it out, and once I finally had it down, she moved on to something else.  I ended up fast-forwarding to the strength training because I felt like it was wasting my time. The strength training, however it pretty good.  If you use heavier weights, I think she goes too fast through the contractions.  She also does a LOT of ab work at a time with no breaks in between or stretching.  And the glut moves were too intense for me.  Overall, I think there are some better fitness dvds out there.  Try Ellen Barret or Rebekah Sturvie.",1374796800,,1012,4.2460732984293195
2604153,5,B000GB5MD8,I bought this CD to replace a video I have enjoyed for years.  Having the additional Kathy Smith videos all in one place offers additional options to my health and fitness. I can even pop it into my laptop when traveling so not to disrupt my routine. Thank you.,1369699200,,261,4.326530612244898
2604154,5,B000GB5MD8,"The Body Basics workout is the BEST and I am so glad now that I can do it. I haven't had a VHS player for a few years so it's wonderful that it's now on DVD. Of course, it's a little inconvenient and takes awhile since it has no menu for DVD, but it's a minor problem. for Kathy Smith fans, this is a must have!",1362528000,,311,3.727272727272727
2604155,4,B000GB5MD8,"I'm so excited to have these on DVD!  My VHS of the Fat Burning Workout died roughly 8 years ago and I've mourned the loss ever since.  I love Kathy and have a lot of her new stuff but this will always be my favorite workout, it works and it's just plain fun.  The image quality kind of disappointed me but you know what?  My VHS wasn't crystal clear either, I think it would be downright scary if we were looking at those old leotards in HD.

I have my favorite workout again.  This copy is mine mine mine!!",1358985600,,508,4.08080808080808
2604156,5,B000GB5MD8,Great fat burning video that is joint friendly and is a good workout! Happy to find this one again and now on DVD!,1357171200,,114,4.0
2604157,5,B000GB5MD8,"I've been working out to this dvd for many years.  I owned the vhs version until it wore out.  It works your body from head to toe without having to lay on the floor.  I've done many video workouts, but always come back to this one.",1353024000,,232,4.0
2604158,5,B000GB5MD8,Great product. I have been using these workouts since they were first produced on video. I am glad to have them on DVD.,1334880000,,119,4.217391304347826
2604159,5,B000GB5MD8,"If you're seriously into physical fitness, then you gotta have these workouts in your collection. Body Basics, Winning Workout, and Fat Burning Workout are essential and I'm so glad that Kathy had the good sense to put them together on one DVD. Awesome!

I say these workouts are essential because Kathy has her own style which is very unique and incredibly effective. You don't have to go bonkers with Cathe Freidrich or Jillian Michaels if you don't have that in you, but you can still get equal results at a more moderate pace with these spectacular old school routines. That's an ironclad guarantee. You can learn to live with the corny music, or just slap on some head phones and listen to your own stuff. LOL!

Now don't get me wrong, I'm a Cathe Friedrich freak, but I can't do her most way out stuff yet. I'm a work in progress on that. And I'll never roll with most of Cathe's dancy step workouts. I dig her old school classics that's more stepping than dancing.

So I'll always rely on Kathy Smith to a large degree no matter what. Girlfriend delivers on the results without going mad. No matter how advanced you may become, there will always be days when you feel drained of energy and not like pushing hard for Cathe or Jillian. But you can still stay in great shape with Kathy Smith at a moderate pace. She's a fitness Goddess.",1331424000,5,1340,4.506172839506172
8130209,2,B000GB5MD8,"Got the video fairly quickly and the packaging was great--so far so good. The three workouts were one of my favorites from Kathy Smith from the 80's. From the moment I inserted the disc in to my CD drive, I couldn't believe the very poor quality of the video on each workout, not just one workout but all three. The scenes are muted and blurry. Too much of a hassle to send back. Not worth it. I do love Kathy Smith and she was about the best out there. I'm just disappointed in the quality. I should have kept my old VCR tape and machine. The quality of that was 10 times better. Once again, you get what you pay for!",1522540800,,618,4.115702479338843

8130212,5,B000GB5MD8,"Great buy, I had the fat burning workout of this on VHS in the early 90s and was pleased to pick up three workouts on one DVD for a reasonable price brand new. Very fast shipping and a nice transaction. Thank you!",1487376000,,213,4.095238095238095
8130213,5,B000GB5MD8,"Okay, I bought this one to replace the Fat Burning Workout videotape that was beginning to sound a bit funky (worn out). It was the first workout video by Kathy Smith that I ever used. The three workouts on this DVD are classics and I love seeing the '80s outfits and hair. But, the workouts are still relevant and helpful. The human body hasn't changed, afterall, and we still need the same moves to stay fit. Best of all, they are fun and I still look forward to them.",1479168000,,470,4.292134831460674
8130214,5,B000GB5MD8,"Kathy Smith is my go to on workouts. She knows how to get the body into fat burning mode and you get results fast. I did these workouts religiously in 80s and early 90s as a teen, now in my 40s i am purchasing this again to get me back into shape. I am excited to start feeling better and take care of myself again. I recommend the fat burning workout for sure. Not familiar with the other two as well. Anything Kathy Smith is great though. I saw my younger sister the other day and she looked really skinny and fit, so of course i asked her what she is doing.
She is the one who told me this was on dvd and she had been doing the fat burning one. I immediately got on Amazon and bought it. And just for a bonus tip if you are like me and can not really do alot of strenuous stuff like burpees, jumping lunges, etc.,  because of sports injuries or just for health reasons I also recommend Mari Winsor Pilates. It is amazing and easy on the body. Very effective on changing the body. Just remember eat right, drink lots of water, and exercise.",1477267200,,1042,4.107843137254902
