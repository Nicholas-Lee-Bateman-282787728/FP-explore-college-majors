1514415,2,B00005JKVT,"As an animal lover I found this movie to be a massive disappointment. The plot has a Miami dentist and dog hater (Cuba Gooding Jr) inheriting his late adoptive mothers sled dog team and moves to Alaska. This is just an excuse for lots of clumsy slapstick a la Cuba's LIGHTNING JACK. The dogs are amusing, but poor old Cuba is wasted. STAR TREK's Nichelle Nichols also co-stars, as does the late James Coburn, who also deserves a better script. Kids may enjoy this, but adults are advised to steer clear. For movies with cute talking animals, you'll never be able to beat BABE.",1040083200,,576,4.548076923076923
1514416,3,B00005JKVT,"Cuba Gooding Jr. Stars as Dr Ted Brooks, and Nichelle Nichols, stars as his adoring cookie-baking widowed mother. From the previews of this film I had assumed this movie was about dogs who could talk (ala Babe). I'm sorry to say,  its not. The dogs only talk in one (particularly funny) dream sequence.
When Miami dentist Ted Brooks learns, that he is adopted, he is summoned to the distant North for the reading of his will. In Alaska,  Ted learns some surprising facts about his TRUE parentage. Ted's mother was a sled dog racer, had a mysterious lover, and owns a beautiful piece of property in Alaska, and a horde of  aggressive sled dogs. As Ted tries to explore the past, he becomes sucked into his birth-mother's world, and develops a romantic interest in lovely bartender/innkeeper Barb (Joana Basco).
I thought this movie was a light funny comedy,  with some good acting by Cuba Gooding, James Coburn, and Nichelle Nichols. The scenery was beautiful, and cgi special effects were great.
What I didn't like about the film is it enforced the idea that ""rural live is good, city life is bad,"" and ""city people are incompetent materialistic morons"" (which is a stereotype that has been done to death in recent films). There was also an unfunny slapstick scene where  Ted was trapped on the ice, and fell in,  that raised the hair on the back of my neck.  ( Young Children might get the wrong idea about how to act in a similar situation from viewing this film).
Overall though, a fun movie, the family will probably enjoy this one if they don't intend to take it to seriously. Cuba and Nichelle stole the show.",1036108800,3,1615,4.6456140350877195
1514417,5,B00005JKVT,"I watched this movie after a very stressful day at work and it was a miracle! This movie is so funny that I cried. I am 34 years old and this is my favorite movie! The scene in the cabin when he encounters the dogs was so funny that I was screaming!! That dog demon is so beautiful! Oh, the scene with the skunk...well, hold onto the couch you will laugh so hard! There he is rolling in the snow moaning, ""I smell! I smell!"" I am laughing now just thinking about it. This movie is funny and heartwarming! Please buy it and share it with your family!",1027900800,,549,4.092592592592593
1514418,3,B00005JKVT,"Even though this movie takes place in Alaska it still insults canadians. In the line where Teddy's mom says to a car driver ""I'm so sorry but all I have is American money"" she probably thinks she's in canada because it's snowing. Same with one of Teddy's dreams where he thinks he lives in an Igloo. Canadians don't live in Igloos! Like some gey people think on ""This hour has 22 minutes"". We live in half diesent 2 story homes and those people aren't called Eskimos anymore their called Inuits. We don't get blizzards and 30 below zero weather every winter. And we have 35 degree summers. And we don't always say ""Eh"" in are phrases. Although this movie is entertaining in some parts it still has those questionable parts. Including that Cuba Gooding got killed almost 100 times and still survived. When he flies through a forest he goes straight down the hill and it seems he just ghosts through the trees. Besides that this movie is a very humerous comedy.",1027209600,2,959,4.5813953488372094
1514419,4,B00005JKVT,"Very good Disney movie surrounding a famous dentist in Miami who gets a summons about a will in Alaska. He finds out he is adopted and his real mom lived in Alaska and was a musher. He travels there to find his past, but is like a fish out of water. He meets an attractive young woman who tries to keep him out of trouble. Upon looking around his late mom's home, he comes upon a team of sled dogs. He also meets Thunder Jack, played exceptionally well by James Coburn.
Dentist Brooks finds out Thunder Jack is his dad, and eventually Brooks learns to handle the dog team, and just in time for the Arctic Challenge, where Thunder Jack gets lost in a storm.
Overall, the humor was tasteful, the scenery was great, even if they did film most of it in Alberta, Canada. The huskies are great, my favorite breed of dog. If you're looking for talking dogs throughout the movie, you will not get it, only in Ted Brook's brief dream. Although the dogs play important roles. A good movie to get for your kids.",1026864000,,1000,4.324468085106383
1514420,4,B00005JKVT,"Snow Dogs was cute, and even a little funny, but it basically could have been so much better. Cuba Gooding Jr. shows a great performance, but it was a little long and drawn out. Yes, it was pretty comical, and I did enjoy it, and you will probably too, but I have seen funnier movies. A funny one, but a little in the cold.",1026518400,,323,4.0625
1514421,2,B00005JKVT,"Funny and entertaining - yes, but very predictable and a bit too unbelievable.
I do think the movie does a good job in conveying the different personalities of the dogs. But all togther, it's kind of weak, and before it ended my intrest was melting. Seen it once and that was enough, it's one of those kind of movies.",1023148800,,317,4.389830508474576

as he mushed them through the snow...
Prior reviewers have mentioned that the trailer led some to believe that this is a Talking Dog movie. (Actually, they only talk in a small sequence of a dream.)  This Disney movie is better than a gimmicky talking animal flick.  Filmed against the stunning beauty of Alaska, it deals, comfortably, predictably - with relationships - inside and outside the family and with the animal world - and is a funny travelogue to boot, including riotous rides on the sled.
Cuba Gooding Jr., James Coburn, Nichelle Nichols, and Joanna Bacalso are well cast.  I wish, though, that we could have seen more of Graham Greene, one of my favorite actors.
It's cool fun for the whole family!",1021939200,4,713,4.733870967741935

7940404,5,B00005JKVT,"This is a movie that is on one of my top 10 lists of Disney favorites. Back in the summer when it came out on video, I was walking around my local video store (which is long out of business)one Saturday that summer and my mom asked me if I wanted to rent ""Snow Dogs"". At first I said No, because I thought it was just another kid movie done by Disney. But no, I was wrong so I finally rented it, and I fell i love with it right away.
 It has been one of my favorites since I was almost 13, And now I want my 10 year old brother to see it. I which there could have been a sequel. I have this on VHS and will be buying the DVD real soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter smith",1377993600,,662,3.7971014492753623
7940405,4,B00005JKVT,"one day in 2001 I was praying hard (like I do every day) and I asked the lord can you bring me Sisq, Michael Bolton and Cuba Gooding Jr all in the same place. I grew angry with the lord and began to question my faith when 3 weeks later he still hadn't delivered, then I saw a report on ET (entertainment Tonight not the alien from the movie of the same name) telling me of this delightful movie being made that featured Sisq and Cuba Gooding Jnr, surely it doesn't also feature Michael Bolton I whispered quietly under my breath, at least I thought it was quietly under my breath until the guy standing next to me in the electrical goods store was all like ""quiet I am trying to watch ET"" (interestingly enough he was watching the movie ET which happened to be playing on the TV next to the one I was watching the Entertainment Tonight show on) then ET gave me a glimpse of Michael Bolton! My prayers had been answered and I knew this movie would change my life and be the one thing that would make me feel complete. So I made a calendar (like the Christmas advent ones) counting down the days until the release of Snow Dogs at the Cinemas on January 18 in the year 2002, each day on the calendar had a different picture of Siberian Huskies, however I could only find 3 pictures of Siberian Huskies so instead I just cut out pictures of Huskie men and women to fill out the calendar.

6 years later in 2007 I was cleaning out my room because my parents were kicking me out on the streets and while cleaning up I found an elaborate advent calendar with 152 doors to open each one featuring pictures of increasingly fat people, I kicked myself and remembered Snow Dogs and how I had prayed so hard for it yet here I was almost 7 years later and I hadn't seen it, I rushed down to Blockbuster (a popular video store that was operating back in 2007) and out of breath said ""please tell me you have at least one copy of Snow Dogs in"" despite it being such a wildly popular film they had 4 copies in store, I rented 3 of them (I wasn't taking any chances that one might not work) I rushed home and watched it.

SNOW DOGS!",1324425600,2,2115,4.194103194103194
7940406,4,B00005JKVT,Almost as interesting and entertaining as the film was reading the reviews. There are a lot of people making social judgements about the characters and I think they miss the whole point of the film. Disney set out to make a funny movie about a Miami dentist. It could have been a plumber from Omaha but a dentist is good too. They added enough detail to give the characters a little depth.  Reviewers complain about the depth. Funny. The movie is about a man that is transported to an enviroment completly different for the comfort that he enjoyed in Miami. He learns and copes well and the funny parts mix well with the more dramatic parts. Disney has another winner. I agree with some reviewers that adults will probably enjoy it more than young kids.,1183161600,,753,4.5777777777777775
7940407,5,B00005JKVT,"This movie was GREAT!!!

  It's about a black and white husky sled dog named Demon and other sled dogs. I LOVED it!!!!!!!  It's great!!!!!!!!

7940408,4,B00005JKVT,"A Miami dentist and a team of sledding dogs combine for a humorous, snow-filled adventure. Dr. Ted Brooks (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) has a successful practice, ""Hot Smile,"" when one day his mother drops the news that he was adopted. He soon finds himself in a small Alaska town to claim his inheritance, which includes no money but plenty of dogs - not such a good match for the wealthy, canine-hater! Before heading back to balmy Florida, however, he braves the frigid climate in search of his biological father. He slowly finds himself drawn to the simplicity of the town and its people, including Barb, a tough but sweet bartender, and Thunder Jack (James Coburn), a very rough-on-the-outside, warm-on-the-inside ""musher.""  When the ""Arctic Challenge"" sled race begins soon after, Brooks and his new canine friends discover the meaning of love and family.
There is so much to enjoy about this movie, which comes from a long tradition of Disney snow/dog/sled racing classics (""Snowball Express,"" ""White Fang,"" ""Iron Will""). It's lighter in tone but still provides some thrilling moments against a spectacular Alaskan backdrop. (They could have capitalized on the scenery even more.)  The laughs come naturally in this script, as a Southern city slicker thrust into the Alaskan wilderness is bound to run into goofy situations. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is in fine comedic form, and a scraggly James Coburn easily takes to his lighter side. Both actors have proven their dramatic prowess with serious, decidedly adult roles, but the two fit snuggly into this family film and share some amusing and touching scenes. Though ""Snow Dogs"" lacks the scriptural tightness of films before it, it warms the heart.",1079654400,2,1690,5.097472924187725
7940409,5,B00005JKVT,"Although many of the scenes were more reminicent of Canada than Alaska, the movie was great in its rendition of the Alaskan Sourdough and Cheechako. Cuba Gooding is a great actor and he brought Ted Brooks, the dentist, to life in a spectacular way. I would recommend the movie for all ages.",1065052800,2,290,4.596153846153846
7940410,5,B00005JKVT,it was the best movie i have seen in my life but then again i have seen five thousand four and sixty seven movies and it came out #1 and i mean #1!,1053561600,,147,3.484848484848485
7940411,4,B00005JKVT,"When this movie was released during the first part of 2002, I was reluctant to go see it. Many of the children I worked with at the preschool had seen it and told me it was a ""really good movie"". My family saw it and told me I would probably like it. However, every critical review I read panned the film and against my better judgement, I listened to the critics.  I should know better than that by now.
Sure, the movie is full of stereotypes (big city ones, rural life ones, Canadian ones, Miami ones). Sure there are a few low humor jokes. Sure, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and James Coburn are great actors and could have made ""much better pictures"", but maybe they didn't want to. Maybe they read this script, thought it would be fun and would be something nice to do for, oh I don't know, kids and their families.
I laughed my head off at several spots throughout this movie. Yet, though it is a comedy, SNOW DOGS is much more. It's a coming of age tale. It's a story about a man's quest for his past. It's a film that takes a look at what living is really about.
The film is aimed at children. Surprisingly, it looks at some pretty heavy issues: bi-racial relationships and adoption. Most people don't even recognize that. Perhaps because the film does so in such a childlike way and remains true to itself.
Highly recommended for families and for anyone who has a good sense of humor and isn't stuck on themselves.",1044403200,6,1412,4.3688212927756656
