591292,5,6303181848,Great workout tape. I use it everyday. Great compliment to the excellent book!,1017705600,,78,5.076923076923077
591293,5,6303181848,"A great ab exercise video, and I would recommend using this video with the book by Kurt Brungardt.  There are three levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and all three levels are great.  Found some great results,  and Kurt is great about taking it at your own pace and good about cooling  down after a workout.  Don't know how one could injure themselves since  Brungardt is pretty methodical.  Great movitator too.  If you can get this,  then I suggest you do.",957052800,5,469,4.7625
591294,5,6303181848,"This workout video has 3 levels.  I mastered level 1 and moved on to level 2, which is supposed to ""bring out the cuts"".  The first time I did level 2 I could see the cuts in my abs.  I can't wait to try level  three!  Kurt gives great advice during the workout.  He talks about eating  right, and what levels to do once you've mastered them all.  This is a  great ab workout video!",945388800,7,382,3.986666666666667
591295,1,6303181848,"What can I say at how horrible I have found this workout video? Like I said Kurt needs to go back to training Olympic Athletes. The movements and the workouts are jarring and I sprained my neck after working out with this  tape. I couldn't hardly keep up with the warmup and the warmup was designed  so that I couldn't design it for my aerobic level. After two trys at this  cassette tape, I threw it away. It was that horrible. May this be a warning  to me not to buy his book. I have better things to do with my time and  money. Why didn't Men Of Steel give Girard the job for this workout video  god I don't know. Just a firm warning for anyone seeking an ab workout  program: this video isn't it.",943747200,4,700,4.102941176470588
7840484,5,6303181848,"Bought this tape back in the 90s, but it sat on a shelf. Pulled it out 7 months ago. Lost 40 pounds in 6 months, and have kept it off. Why didn't I do this in the 90s!? Stick with it! ""Train hard, train smart.""",1487721600,,210,3.688888888888889
7840485,5,6303181848,"I remember this from years ago. Abs of steel two wasn't quite as good, with more work in the hip flexors, too much warm up/stretching, more bulk and less burn overall. Also missing the great advice from Kurt. Problem is I don't have a VHS player. Someone should digitize this workout, it's probably the best no-nonsense ab workout of all time.",1442448000,,343,4.639344262295082
7840486,5,6303181848,"This is an old VHS. I purchased one about 20 years ago. I can only say Brungarten is,or was a hellava teacher! You can not find this in a DVD,you will have to transfer it yourself. This will inspire and encourage you to work at and get really cut abs!",1401840000,,251,4.04
7840487,5,6303181848,"Great tape....I owned the same one for along time, but it got too old.  This one came in perfect condition at a very affordable price!!!",1368057600,,136,4.44
7840488,4,6303181848,"I owned this VHS cassette many years ago but it got lost in a move to a new residence. I reordered it through Amazon and like the simplistic lessons it teaches. There are 3 different levels to ""master"" but you can simply skip around once you've done them all a few times. I like the fact that the warm ups and workouts are fairly short. I also like the instructor's philosophy of holding a hand on the isolated muscle that you are working which helps connect the mind with the body. Only negative is I wished it was now updated on DVD as my old VHS machine is near obsolete.",1267920000,2,574,4.2272727272727275
7840489,4,6303181848,I bought this tape two yrs ago and love it it feels like your working with a personal trainer the trainer is very perfersional  I admit you do have to get use to it and to keep up but once you do you can do it on your own I got good results I can see muscles in my stoumach  It targets the right area you can feel the muscles working. downfall is that doesnot have a diet plan to not to eat. if your fat you wouid have to lose weighte  first to see your muscles,1241308800,,461,3.731958762886598
7840490,4,6303181848,"This is a great video and Brungardt is a superb instructor. His book is the best I've read on abs and this is one of the best ab videos I've used. There are actually three workouts on the video. Each gets a bit more challenging.

Brungardt gives you lots of helpful information about your abs and workouts. I would have gladly given it five stars but I found one minor issue. Brungardt showed both a warm up and a cool down but not with each workout in one solid sequence. This could be a problem for those who want to do a warm up, a cool down and the workout all together. Personally I didn't have a problem with it as I do very little warming up and cooling down when it comes to ab workouts.

These workouts are not the ordinary run of the mill exercises and even though they're short workouts, you will feel the burn and the exercises will work.

Be sure and modify any of the exercise forms you may need to, especially if you have a bad back and he warns that the last workout is really not for those with bad backs. If you have his book or can get it, you will see exercises you can do that are safer than others for those with bad backs.

An excellent video. Great for men or women.",1160179200,5,1190,4.116379310344827
7840491,5,6303181848,"I am a women and I love this video.  Years ago a guy in blockbuster video recommended it.  I tried it and I was pleasingly surprised.  If you're a beginner, then you should definitely start with level one and work your way up.  Each level is challenging and effective.  Kurt Brungardt is an awesome trainer.  He works each section of your abs.  No muscle is left out.  Doing this workout along with a little change in your eating habit, I assure you, you would be amazed at the results you'll see.  I highly recommend this video.",1073260800,8,529,4.427083333333333
7840492,5,6303181848,"I used this video for years, first to rehab a low back injury.  I later lost about 8 lbs. and found I had the best abs.  Once you memorize the workouts, you can do them even when away from home.
I've added to the workouts and stretching on the video.  Also, I'm now doing hanging leg raises and using leg weights.  I haven't found another routine that I think is much better.",1047772800,3,375,4.166666666666667
7840493,5,6303181848,"This VHS tape of ab workouts got me prepped for a play in which I had to remove my clothing, and it worked to shape my abs in about 4 or 5 weeks.  I already had a head start, but the programs were a great guide and concentrated ab builder.  Kurt Brungardt's easy-going demeanor and ultra-sensitive hair cut keep you relaxed as you work that gut off!  As long as you concentrate and stay in form during the workouts, you will eject the tape feeling like someone went twenty rounds with your abs with a couple of tennis rackets.  But as Kurt said, it will be ""that good pain.""",1039910400,3,574,4.238532110091743
