7100343,5,B00VNQWVVQ,As soon as I saw the broadcast I knew this was something my brother-in-law would love.  It's entertaining and informative which is a hard combination to find at times.  Our birthday boy loved it and I got a very big smile and thank you hug!,1445990400,,240,4.311111111111111
7100344,5,B00VNQWVVQ,"Say what Genus Hominines paleontology. My interest was hiking in caves and I wanted to see inside that cave. Well I did watch the documentary but it took an hour since the first hour of this documentary is class 101 in paleontology. National Geographic has done such a superb job of presenting facts that I was glued for the first hour since after all in order for these scientists to analyze any skeleton, they refer to minerals and I love minerals. Then there was the second hour which was about the cave and the discovery.

Now I will follow their findings since it is exciting find. This documentary really gave me the understanding of how the science of finding human origin works based on human science. Informative, educational and interesting to see the past. Hope Raymond Arthur Dart is watching this. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1444953600,9,831,4.770833333333333

8710761,5,B00VNQWVVQ,"Having watched almost every DVD about human origins or development that Amazon sells, this presentation was one of the best.  Yes, it was thrilling, but also rich in information.",1497916800,,178,5.137931034482759
8710762,2,B00VNQWVVQ,"The program was made before the fossil finds were dated. Dating results have now been published (2017). Contrary to the claims in the program these are not hominids from the ""dawn of humanity"" 2 million years ago, they are hominids from the late evolutionary period about 200,000 years ago, when anatomically modern humans had already evolved.",1496275200,7,343,5.142857142857143
8710763,5,B00VNQWVVQ,This is one of the more informative DVDs I've seen on human development. It is interesting all the way through. I have watched it a couple of times because there is just so much information to absorb.,1491609600,3,200,4.4324324324324325

8710766,4,B00VNQWVVQ,"..and here today we have people that do not believe in what has been shown here, and not to even mention believing in Dinosaurs.  You can not deny facts that have been discovered.  This video was very interesting, but you would think that today even a cell phone camera would have recorded better video.  If they have better masters, it would be nice to make better copies.  That is my only gripe.",1448755200,5,397,4.472222222222222
8710767,5,B00VNQWVVQ,This is an excellent video about the work of scientists researching the evolution of humans.  The discovery and subsequent analysis of fossils at the Rising Star site in Africa is just fantastic.  The work there has just begun and I hope they will continue to share what they learn with all of us.,1447891200,9,297,4.584905660377358
