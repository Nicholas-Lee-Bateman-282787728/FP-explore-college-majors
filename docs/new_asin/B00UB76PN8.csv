I agree with other reviewers that the acting was terrible.  I wasted $1.99 to watch this movie.  Don't think about buying it or renting it, even if it goes on Prime",1440374400,,285,4.222222222222222

8705180,1,B00UB76PN8,Hard to watch the actors embarass themselves so miserably. Maybe someone accidentally switched the first rehearsal and the final cut.,1439769600,,133,5.7

8705182,1,B00UB76PN8,I'm sorry but this movie was low budget with corny acting and there was no horror in it at all. Don't let the cover fool you. Waste of money.,1438214400,,141,3.896551724137931
8705183,1,B00UB76PN8,NO!!! JUST NO!! I am in hopes this is not any type of film student because if so we are in trouble the next few years. Watch trailer on YT before buying this garbage. WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN MAKING A MOVIE,1438128000,4,201,3.8095238095238093

8705186,5,B00UB76PN8,"It's an amazing movie telling the story of a very famous place called Casa Matusita in Lima Peru. Very scary place, that many people tried to expend a night in that haunted house, but no one can explain the very weird events that happened there. There are many versions of the Casa Matusita true, but Let me out Story, is the one that I like the most.
I Love it. Excellent effects, Thank You.",1427587200,,392,4.3108108108108105
