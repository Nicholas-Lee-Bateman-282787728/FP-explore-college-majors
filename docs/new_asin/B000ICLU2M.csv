8144987,3,B000ICLU2M,"I purchased this to show to our students for our Spanish film series.  I don't think they will like this movie, as it plays some rather cheesy music throughout.",1380672000,,160,4.517241379310345
8144988,5,B000ICLU2M,"All the friends and family that have watched the movie and appreciate the Mexican culture love the movie.  The first time I watched the movie many people in the room were crying during the sad scenes and were laughing during the funny scenes.  If you appreciate the Mexican culture and value the hard work of a student and the limited resources, you will appreciate the movie.",1235260800,,376,4.681818181818182
8144989,5,B000ICLU2M,"Seldom is the point of view of a child the subject of a story for adults. This film shows the negative side-effects a Mexican family must endure when parents seek work in the Unites States, as well as some commentary on race within the latino culture. Filmed in mexico, it has an authentic feel and a wonderful soundtrack. The story is non-formulaic and has the likeable spirit of independent films.",1202256000,2,399,4.714285714285714
8144990,5,B000ICLU2M,"I watched the movie and besides being Latin I think it is a great movie because it shows than just explaining what a immigrant goes through to come to this country.  Just actually seeing the movie makes you realize how other immigrants suffer and makes you think that you are a little more
blessed than them.  Whether you are legalized to me in this country or were born here that is something you should me thankful for and I think we have to make good use of it.",1182902400,,464,4.261363636363637
8144991,1,B000ICLU2M,"I was very excited to watch this movie since it was filmed by a Latina in Chicago. What a disappointment! The movie was boring and with very very bad acting and directing, (I know it was a low budget film and made by a student), but it could have been better. I felt there was never a connection or resolution, it just kept jumping from scene to scene. The writer/director tried to include way too many things making it a very weak film. I would have preferred one or two main points only and really developing them. I agree with the other review, this movie does not really focus on the life of an immigrant in the USA and it also but me to sleep.",1181088000,3,648,4.192
8144992,1,B000ICLU2M,"This film suppose to show how hard it is to immigrate, and live in the united states as an immigrant with limited to no english proficiency.. but its a bunch of boringness.. i suggest you do not buy this movie its a sleeper",1176249600,4,223,4.209302325581396
