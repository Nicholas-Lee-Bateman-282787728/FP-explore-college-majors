543353,5,6303026451,"My nephew passed on some of his old videos and this was among them. My son loved it! I then ordered the bulldozer, airplane, train, and tractor versions. He loves them all. And he has learned so much from them. He can tell me about different parts of the trains, knows the difference between a bulldozer and a backhoe, and that bombs explode up in the air above the containment device. Heck, I learned a lot from them as well. These are funny, entertaining, and educational. If you have a car lover, these will be a big hit.",1070323200,,524,4.357142857142857
543354,5,6303026451,"My 16 month old son LOVES this video and LOVES fire trucks! Basically trucks of any kind, but especially fire trucks.  This video holds his attention and he loves that they show different fire trucks all thru the video.",1063843200,,219,4.615384615384615
543355,5,6303026451,"My 20-month old son entered a Fire Truck phase, so I purchased this video.  Even though his understanding of the content is questionable, he **loves** watching the firefighters and fire trucks in action.  We limited his watching of the video because he was requesting it three or four times a day!  My husband and I still enjoy watching the video with him (even after several months!) because of the detailed information they give.  Not only do they explain how different types of fire trucks work, but they show a fire station at an airport, bomb squad equipment, and firefighters at work at a training facility.  If your child love fire trucks (even if they are little ones!), I would strongly recommend this video!",1059264000,,717,4.796747967479675
543356,5,6303026451,"My almost 3 year old son loves this tape!!  He could watch it everyday, all day if I let him.  His first words in the morning are ""fire truck tape"" and we keep hearing it all day.  This tape occupies him for the whole time even though there are no children, songs or animals.  This tape is a winner at our house and we can't wait to see the others in the series.",1049068800,,362,3.9178082191780823
543357,5,6303026451,"If you are a fan of the ""There Goes A....."" series, you will not be disappointed in this edition.  Firefighter Dave and Firefighter Becky are up to their usual wacky highjinks in this informative and fast-paced video.  My two-year-old, a firefighter junkie, plays this one over and over.  It is filled with great shots of firefighters in action, and covers a wide variety of topics, including different trucks, equipment, uniform pieces, and tasks.  There are all the familiar sights and sounds that children associate with firefighters, like wailing sirens, hoses squirting water, men sliding down the firepole, and a dalmation in the firehouse.  The tape has interviews, music, and comedy skits by the main characters that keep children attending, and the language is simple and easy to understand.  As with the other videos in the series, safety and education are central ideas. If you have a little firefighter, this video will ""spark"" their interest.",1043280000,,955,5.1688311688311686
543358,5,6303026451,"This was a little movie that my son, 3,  spotted at the grocery store and he just had to have it.  I was reluctant because we own at least 5 other ""fire-truck"" movies!  We got it and he has not watched any of his other fire truck movies.  He watches this over and over.  It is pretty good and Dave (the main character) does a really good job making it interesting for children.  We are also purchasing the Monster truck one because he reminds me everyday that he wants it so Santa is bringing one to him.  I know he pays close attention to the movie and what Dave says because my son quotes him to me and while playing with his firetrucks and other rescue toys.",1039564800,,661,4.15748031496063
543359,5,6303026451,"This is our first Dave Hood ""There Goes a .... "" video, but it won't be the last.  The host, Firefighter Dave, does a fine job of holding kids' interest while making the information entertaining.  In the course of this 35-minute video you'll be introduced to many firefighters in various situations, visit firefighter training facilities, and get tours of the firehouse and several types of trucks, including fireboats and airport firetrucks.  There is nothing frightening or scary here, and the ""don't play with fire"" message is stated simply and clearly.  We watch this video multiple times a day, and the adults in the house have not been driven insane.  Our son has surprised us with the things he understands about fire engines, and we're looking forward to viewing others in the series.  Actually, my _husband_ suggested we get more of the series -- especially the one about airplanes.
Highly recommended for little (and big) firetruck enthusiasts.",1027900800,,954,5.083333333333333
543360,5,6303026451,Excellent child entertainment video.  My son has watched it daily ever since he could ask for it by name.  I highly reccomend the entire series!,1025827200,,144,4.72
543361,5,6303026451,"Kids age 2 up will watch this over and over.  My son is 3 and has been watching the whole line of ""There goes a"" videos over for a year with no signs things will change soon.  What did he ask Santa for?  A new ""There goes a"" video!  We now own 6 and have rented all the others multiple times.  Forget all the PC people who say Dave and Becky sometimes aren't PC enough - it's all obviously in fun and won't even be noticed by your kids much less affect them in any way.",1010361600,,469,3.84375
543362,5,6303026451,"I have two young boys ages 5 and 2 1/2. My youngest son is almost 3 years old and he LOVES trucks! It doesn't matter what kind of truck, he just loves it. I bought ""There Goes a Fire truck"" because he had loved ""There Goes a Truck"" so much! He watches both of these at least once a day!!! This series of videos is a big hit with our family! They are very interesting even to adults. The videos have factual information in them, they are not cartoons. The videos aren't real long. My youngest son doesn't have a very long attention span, and this video hold his attention until it is over. Sometimes he'll want to watch it again and again. I thought this video was interesting, and I am just a mom, I can't imagine how thrilling this video is for a boy! This episode was very interesting, it  showed all about the different vehicles used to fight fires. This definately gets a thumbs up from our family!!!",992649600,,904,4.286549707602339
543473,1,6303026451,I had High hopes for this video based on the reviews i read. 10 years ago it might have been an OK video by today's standards it doesn't compete. The Video quality is bad the material and the look is dated. This video should be called what fire trucks use to look like. Save your money till a newer one comes along.,984009600,,315,4.096774193548387

543475,5,6303026451,I bought this video for my nephew on his 2nd birthday because he loves trucks.  His 3rd birthday is approaching soon and I am told this video tape  is still his favorite!,967939200,,170,4.28125
543476,5,6303026451,"As the proud owner of There Goes a Truck, Train, Airplane, Bulldozer, Dumptruck and Fire Truck, I can say that according to my son (24 months), this is one of the best.  He asks for it about ten times a day, and watches  it intently.",963705600,,233,4.155555555555556
543477,4,6303026451,"My 3 year old is a big fan of fire trucks.  He loves seeing them, going to  the fire house and playing with toy fire trucks.
He has also been a big  fan of the video Road Construction.  When heard about There Goes A Fire  Truck I immediately bought it for him.  AND HE LOVES IT!  Wakes up in the  morning asking for ""Fire Truck Video"".
Turns out that my 6 year  old daughter and 9 year old son also liked it.  As an adult it was  interesting for the first time or two.
Now for the hard part which is a  video that a 3 year old wants to see again and again.",959904000,,556,3.780701754385965
543478,5,6303026451,"My 2 year old is very into firetrucks at the moment and this has become his favorite movie.  It teaches so much about the equipment and duties (in fact I learned the difference between a fire truck and a fire engine!) of  fire fighters with some silly moments placed throughout.  The ultimate  message is of fire safety, something very important when looking at this  subject.",959126400,,376,4.723076923076923
543479,4,6303026451,"Ever since my son, David, 4, first saw this video, he wants to be a firefighter.  He has seen this video so many times that we have lost count.  The gadgets and doo-dads that Firefighter Dave shows my son are very  interesting.  Now my son has a whole collection of firetrucks, and it all  started with this one video.  I am very happy that this video inspired in  my son a respect for the firefighting profession, and he's only 4!",948844800,,431,4.3125
543480,5,6303026451,"This video gives an excellent overview of firefighting. It was interesting to me, my husband and my 2-1/2 year old son. You see a fire station, a firefighter's clothing and gear, and all the fire equipment they use. Do you know the difference between a fire truck and a fire engine? I do, now,  after watching this exciting and educational video. This is a excellent  video for any boy/girl who loves fire trucks, and any mother/father who  have to watch it many times. We love the silly scenes with Dave Hood!",945648000,,510,4.582417582417582
543481,5,6303026451,"This is an excellant child and family video about the job of the firefighter. While our hero Dave is in this video, the primary focus is on the men & women of the firehouse and the tools of their job. They  discuss fire safety in an easy to understand way, emphasizing importance of  planning for safety, and how a firefighter does his/her job. The trucks  they show are fantastic, with complete information provided. Shows planned  fires and how they are handled. This gives a good overview of a situation  from calling 911 to time the fire is out.",944524800,,549,4.561224489795919
543492,5,6303026451,My sister is a firefighter and she said this video was VERY well done!  My three year old son has watched it so many times we've lost count and continues to love it.  It is educational enough for parents and fun enough  for the kids - you can't go wrong!,941673600,,254,4.04

7835805,4,6303026451,My son wanted a copy and ours somehow got erased. This is in good shape and he loves it. It is used with typical wear and tear.,1473811200,,127,3.740740740740741
7835806,5,6303026451,"Absolutely best movie for children...especially boys!  Both of our children LOVED this movie as well as ""There Goes a Police car""!",1424563200,,130,5.190476190476191
7835807,5,6303026451,This is a great movie for age 2-4 years old.  Our grandsons absolutely loved the entire series.  This one shows real fire trucks and what each does.  I sure hope it comes out as a DVD soon.  They are educational and fun all at the same time.,1293494400,,241,4.0638297872340425
7835808,5,6303026451,"Even though I'll be turning 15 on Feb. 1 of this year, I still think this is a GREAT and wonderfully WACKY video. I'll switch to the Real Wheels series on DVD, sometime. Dave Hood, you're excellent, even to someone who might be too old for these series!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1137283200,,265,4.541666666666667
7835809,5,6303026451,"Obviously, from other reviews, it depends on the kid.  However, my 3 1/2 year old boy and 2 year old boy have insisted on watching this video every single night before bed time for the past month!  They absolutely love it and I have learned a few things from it myself.",1105401600,,269,4.254901960784314
7835810,2,6303026451,"Very little of ""Dave"" in this one, however the fire fighters describing the trucks forgot this is video is for very young children. For example a fire fighter, when speaking about where  drinks on the truck, says they need to drink when they get ""dehydrated"". What person under 6 knows what that means? He should, of course, use the word ""thirsty"".  The problem is that this movie left it into the hands of the professional fire fighters to describe the trucks and equipment. These guys may be great fire fighters, but when they start throwing about terms like ""dehydration"" and spouting nozzle sprays specifications, and various ladder heights my 2 year old, who just loves fire trucks starts staring at me (not the TV). This video would be perfect for adults who want to learn the very basics about fire trucks and fire fighting.
However, we just bought it, and only saw it once. I've yet to find out if he wants to see it again but I'm sure he will. It does have some good fire truck action sceens.",1087516800,,1001,4.555555555555555
7835811,5,6303026451,"You will probably have to with this one!  My 3 and a half year old son watched this one sometimes more than once a day for about a month.  He's tapered off now, but probably due to the fact that he's memorized the whole thing.  The video is surprisingly informative, with enough goofiness, lack of condescension, and humor to keep my son entertained.",1084406400,,350,4.523809523809524
7835812,1,6303026451,"My 2-year-old adores fire trucks, and I bought this video on the strength of the reviews posted here. It is a sore disappointment. Most of the video is of Fireman Dave talking, walking, showing off; way too many interviews with firefighters; there's little video of the fire trucks themselves, and virtually none of the trucks fighting fires.  For a kid who loves fire trucks, and wants to see fire trucks, this is not a great video. I don't recommend it.",1084233600,,455,4.6875
7835813,2,6303026451,"This video is handicapped by the fact that there is little real-life fire truck action.  Bulldozers and trains can be filmed while they are serving their true purpose, but here real firefighting is absent.  Instead we are treated to practice fighting against a weak fire in a bland concrete structure (give us a destructive blaze, for crying out loud!), demonstrations of hoses, long lectures on equipment, serious-faced safety warnings, and various data, like how long the hoses are and how many gallons of water can be sprayed per minute.  To spice it up, Dave treats us to high-tech video tricks like having the firemen go backward up the pole and slide, Wow!
This production feels more like a 3rd grade field trip to the local station, captured on video by the student teacher.  My kids found other things to do about halfway through.",1073260800,,838,4.839160839160839
