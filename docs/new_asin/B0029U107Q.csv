Unfortunately, they'll have to live on Jimmy's paltry $25 / week from his job at the bank. All things considered, including time behind bars, the two decide that it would be better, and certainly more profitable, to steal $100,000.00 from the bank instead! After the theft, they hide the money inside a music box. Enter Detective Mike Roberts (Lionel Atwill- THE VAMPIRE BAT, DOCTOR X, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM) who gives the couple a good talking-to, then they're off to prison. When they finally get paroled, they discover that the terms of their release precludes their getting married. Roberts re-enters their lives to be there when they crack. During this time, Jimmy and Ruth run into many obstacles and delays in their pursuit of the ill-gotten gains. THE WRONG ROAD is a fable, complete w/ morally-uplifting message.

THE WRONG ROAD (1937) is a REPUBLIC crime programmer with a pre-Noir storyline.

Here, a young couple, two kids from well-off homes, grow weary of earning small paychecks so they embezzle $100K from the bank where Jimmy (Cromwell) works. They intentionally turn themselves in after stashing the loot in an antique music box and posting it to Ruth's (Mack) Uncle Louie, a man who owns a curio shop.

Both are sentenced to ""up to 10 years"" but are released after only 2, thanks to Mike Roberts (Atwill), a private investigator employed by the bank who's trying to recover the stolen cash from them. Ruth and Jimmy give Roberts the slip and beat it to Uncle Louie's, but discover the old man died a just couple of months before they got out of jail; the contents of his shop have been given to an auction house. Events surrounding the pursuit of that music box, plus their being dogged by both the P.I. and Blackie Clayton (McMahon), a prison mate of Jimmy's who demands a 1/3rd cut, are elements later found in films noir.

Jimmy and Ruth are outbid at auction for the music box in a suspenseful and well presented scene. Their arrival at the rural boarding home of the box's new owner, Martha Foster (Main), plus her coincidentally being married to the town's sheriff (Powell) and the older couple's knowledge (thanks to P.I. Roberts) of why Ruth and Jimmy have come knocking, challenge credibility (to say the least). The simultaneous reappearance of a threatening Blackie pushes this tale into the realm of comedy.

It begins at a nightclub. A couple dances and talks. Ruth and Jimmy discuss their past. Jimmy was fired because his job was given to a relative of the owner of the bank. They complain about their poverty. Jimmy has a scheme to get rich by embezzling $100,000 and hiding the money. No regrets. The next day they confess to a bank detective, who tells them what will really happen to them. They get an exemplary sentence of one to ten years without parole. Jimmy gets a job as a messenger in prison ; he gives a written message to Ruth. This results in extra punishment for them. Mr. Roberts, the detective, asks for parole so he can try to recover the money. There are rules for being on parole. They meet on a ferry boat. They have toughened up. Mr. Roberts meets them, they have agents all over the world. Their job is to sell vacuum cleaners. They learn Uncle Bill had died, his property was sold to an auctioneer.

One item up for sale is a music box. A man bids $100 and wins it. He mailed it to his aunt in Sunnydale. Blackie is there and offers help; he wants a third. Mr. Roberts shows up and asks for the money; he says they are growing bitter. Blackie teaches them a lesson. Everything has gone wrong. They argue. They are caught stealing a train ride and taken to the police station. They find Fosters Guest Farm and stay there. They hear a telephone conversation! Mr. Roberts drops by, he recovered their car stolen by Blackie. He warns them Blackie is on their trail. Blackie offers a deal to Ruth. She tells Jimmy about this. They take the music box and drive away. Blackie shoots at them and follows in a car chase. He catches them, Ruth tells him where the money is. There is a shot. Ruth doesnt want to be on the run. They hand over the money to Mr. Roberts. They are happy.

This is an interesting and pleasant film that serves as a moral warning. Those who get rich quick can find troubles that they never expected. Even if done honestly, as in winning a lottery.",1488844800,,2008,4.320954907161804
