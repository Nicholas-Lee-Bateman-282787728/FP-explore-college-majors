8435609,5,B004M7M4J2,"This is a great DVD of the background of the circus which is M.C.'d by Zachary Gordon (Star of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies)  He does a great job of showing us all the different behind the scenes of the Greatest Show on Earth.

Very enjoyable to watch and a fun family movie to see.",1522454400,,285,3.982456140350877
8435610,3,B004M7M4J2,Ringling Bros. fools us with this DVD. This DVD is NOT of the circus performance / show itself.  It is ONLY highlights and some behind-the-scenes footage.  Don't buy this if you think you will see the show itself.,1321142400,5,213,4.578947368421052
