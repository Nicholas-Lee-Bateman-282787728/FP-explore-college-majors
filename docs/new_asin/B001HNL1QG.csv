8309188,5,B001HNL1QG,"The acting was good, the first person that reviewed is like Obama all talk and says nothing. I also , saw vampire bates and thought both where good, in the bates show how kids are learning and trying to figure out things which you don't see very often, so instead of putting down a movie of how the actors where or if it is a remake, it is the thinking process of how species behave. Was nice to see lucy lawless do something normal.",1420848000,,433,4.166666666666667

Entomologist MADDY RIERDON (Lucy Lawless) works with a task force - including a gritty DR. named PETER AXELROD (John Heard) - to eradicate BIOENGINEERED LOCUSTS threatening the UNITED STATES.  These LOCUSTS are special because they CAN RESIST pesticides and are attracted to HOT DOGS and BIRTHDAY CAKE.

Along the way a gorgeous brunette OFFICE WORKER gets insecticized, a SILO becomes a ridiculous location to hide, an idiot GENERAL goes after LOCUSTS with VX GAS, a LOCUST gets into a WOMAN'S mouth, peoples' LIVESTOCK get eaten, and most of the swarm is killed by an impromptu BUG-ZAPPER.

Sadly, GREGORY ALAN WILLIAMS and MIKE FARRELL pull one of the plugs from a career that is already on life support, but remain the more competent actors in the film.

It's a Syfy movie, so the production is predictably decent and the special effects are borderline atrocious; mostly it's just a bunch of BLACK CGI dots on the screen.  LUCY LAWLESS looks sexy but not as good as when she was a WARRIOR PRINCESS.  Ultimately, however, she's unbelievable as someone who would go into work as a bug expert.  It's a good way to pass the time, but awards it will not win.
