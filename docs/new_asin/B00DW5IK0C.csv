8598569,4,B00DW5IK0C,"""Fin"" was surprisingly good and very well acted!  I went into it totally ""blind"" - knowing nothing.  And if I knew that each/every movie I went into ""blind"" would be as enjoyable as ""Fin"" was, I would que them all up and start watching without hesitation or reserve.  This is no ""B"" movie and is superior on almost all levels compared to the typical Hollywood drivel that is made and marketed for the US market.",1417392000,,411,4.453333333333333
8598570,5,B00DW5IK0C,"Fin (translated as The End) was quite an enjoyable, what the hey is going on genre film. It is in Spanish but has clear English subtitles, and once the main plot of the film is underway, there's not a great deal of talking anyway. The film only goes for 90 minutes, and really you're better off going into this like I did not knowing a thing about it. Of course though you're not going to buy a film with no information so I'll outline how this starts without I'm hoping spoiling too much of it for you. The basic plot without trying to give anything away revolves around a reunion of friends who haven't seen each other for twenty years or so at a remote house in some mountains somewhere in the Spanish wilderness. However it soon becomes apparent that everyone either dislikes or has harboured resentment towards at least one other person in the group for what they did in those younger days. They all also did something bad to a guy who hung with them in the past, who all but one of them had no idea was even invited let alone organised their little get together. He of course hasn't shown up and when a few of them realise he's no longer locked away in a mental asylum they want to bail. However for some reason all their car batteries are flat, their phones don't work and something that flew over the top of them on fire and crashed somewhere in the valley bellow is also playing on their minds. Are they in a slasher movie reunion usually set in a high school gym scenario where one of them is getting their vengeance for the past, or is something bigger that affects their region of Spain, or even the entire world happening or did while they were at the isolated cabin. Such as World War III, a terrorist attack, alien abduction, virus on a meteorite, the apocalypse. Whatever is going on they decide to hike the day or so it will take to the nearest town to find out, but how many will make it there, and what is making them disappear without trace one by one?

It's definitely an enjoyable film to watch. I like how unlike Hollywood films the people look more everyday, not all smoking hot. For some reason too, remember when the Show Party of Five came out in the 90's and three day stubble pretending you don't shave become all the rage, well every guy in this one except one, doesn't like to shave either. I just found that quite amusing. The only thing I thought could have been done better was the ending. I don't really want to go into that in any more detail so as not to spoil the film for you. I'd still rate it five stars though for its enjoyability factor overall.",1397779200,,2588,4.336082474226804
8598571,3,B00DW5IK0C,"In a 2012 Spanish thriller The End (Fin) a group of old friends are re-united in an isolated mountain cottage for the weekend. While they are having a good time, talking with old friends for the first time in many years, there is a certain thing they would rather not talk about, something related to one ngel (Eugenio Mira), who is not here now.

In the meanwhile, they realize that something strange is going on. All the electronic machines are dead and the communication with the world outside is impossible. Animals start acting weird. What happened to the world or the entire humanity while they are staying in the cabin?

Those who are looking for a sci-fi (or apocalyptic / psychological) thriller would be disappointed with The End, a very ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to genre-bend. Director Jorge Torregrossa succeeds in creating an unnerving atmosphere, while viewers anticipate something logical happening. Unfortunately, they will not get one. Of course, you don't have to explain everything in your film  you don't have to tell me why birds start attacking people in The Birds  but The End raises too many questions without making the film interesting.

To me, The End is closer to Kiyoshi Kurosawas Pulse than to Alfred Hitchcocks classic  both telling the stories of the world that disintegrates, but with much better narrative skills. The End has a few thrilling sequences (all involving animals), but as a whole, the film only frustrates, not fascinates, us.",1384300800,3,1493,5.048780487804878
