8577408,4,B00C5H6Q72,"This movie is a curio at best, but will be fun for Jimmy Clanton fans and fans of early R&B and Rock. This was Jimmy's second movie, the first being Alan Freed's ""Go, Johnny, Go!"" which featured Jimmy's big hit ""Go, Jimmy, Go!"" along with many rock'n'roll acts of 1959. Teenage Millionaire came out in 1961, after his first big chart hits and before his Venus In Blue Jeans comeback in 1962. In it Jimmy sings three songs: Teenage Millionaire, Possibility, and Green Light.

The movie is structured in an odd way that makes it feel like two movies, with each part interrupting the flow of the other. First there's Jimmy's movie, a black and white story of teenage Bobby, whose parents were killed in an accident and left him the heir of millions, including a big radio station. Apparently he immediately was surrounded by gold-diggers, so his strict, old fashioned Aunt Theodora (ZaSu Pitts in her best old-maid style) now keeps a tight leash on him, even assigning a bodyguard to watch over him (a gruff but friendly Rocky Graziano). Jimmy is a typical teenager who likes rock'n'roll, and gets drawn to the radio station where he meets a girl and cuts his own record. It's a slight and predictable story, wholly carried by Jimmy's natural charm and Rocky's down to earth nature.

Then there are the musical segments by other artists. These are not incorporated into the story film by having them drop by the radio station to plug their new song, or by having Jimmy go to a concert. Instead, each artist was filmed recording a song in a studio. These performances are unique to this film, as they are all done with the same background, and not just some concert footage edited in. This at least makes these performances special. But what happens is that whenever Jimmy puts on a record or turns on the radio, one of these performance clips pops up. Not only that, but they're each tinted a single color to differentiate them from the plotted film. The result is that the plot of the film, slight as it is, is totally interrupted and conversely, just when you're getting into the music, suddenly this movie returns. Weird.

But there are some really nice music clips here, sort of an early form of a music video. The headliners are Jackie Wilson, Chubby Checker, Bill Black's Combo, Dion, and Marv Johnson, with newcomers (who never really made it) Vicki Spencer (kind of a Connie Stevens type) and Jack Larson (not the same Jack Larson who played Jimmy Olsen on the fifties' Superman TV show). Of course Jackie Wilson is always worth seeing, and Chubby Checker is plugging a new dance here, ""The Jet"", that didn't take off, but he soon would be riding high on the second wave of The Twist fad in early '62. Of special interest is Marv Johnson, who was discovered by Berry Gordy, Jr. and had just come off his biggest career hit, You Got What it Takes (1960)  His career was short so there are not many clips of him performing. Dion is always good, but he sings a pop tune here, Somebody Nobody Wants, and because he was such a rock'n'roller, I would have wanted him to rock a little more.

This is, like I say, just a curio from the past, and at 84 minutes it goes by very quickly. But if you remember the early sixties, you'll like it.",1444521600,,3236,4.553264604810996
