8424472,5,B004CZZZ9A,"Now this is a real doozy of a film. Great performance by Borgnine as a Russian defector who ends up working for the CIA.Set at the height of the Cold War in the early sixties,it drifts between the US,W.Germany ( at the time the wall was being erected) and Moscow. Also shows the suspected inner workings of the KGB (training sleeper cells).Also co-stars Kerwin Matthews ( of Sinbad fame) in a more meaty role.

One of the best espionage films of the genre,they don't get any better than this.",1515801600,,492,4.52808988764045
8424473,5,B004CZZZ9A,"This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it. As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.",1438819200,,218,4.341463414634147
8424474,5,B004CZZZ9A,Good storyline. Filming in Germany and other European locations was very interesting.,1437177600,,85,6.166666666666667
8424475,5,B004CZZZ9A,An amazing tense thriller like only Mr. Borgnine could do.,1427414400,,58,4.9
8424476,4,B004CZZZ9A,"PLOT: Borgnine is a 'communist spy' living in the USA~ is blackmailed to work for the FBI~

1950s~ the height of the RED SCARE~  Ernest Borgnine is a Russian Born Hollywood director~ one of the BEST~ he is also a ""COMMUNIST SPY"" who is busy using his Hollywood parties to 'recruit' the rich and famous to work for the ""communist spy network' operating in the USA~  MOSCOW sends Borgnine his father to the USA~ as a ""reward"" and to continue to MOTIVATE him. The FBI has been watching Borgine and his Communist Spy network. They decide to use good old BLACKMAIL to get Borgnine to work FOR the FBI~  Borgnine is recalled to Moscow~ He goes by way of EAST GERMANY. The Hotel is a delight as we see all the ""spy gadgets"" Borgnine gets to use to keep in contact with the FBI~ right under the communists noses. When he gets to Moscow he is living on borrowed time because he is soon denounced as a double agent and makes his escape back to EAST GERMANY but he is not safe yet. a first rate ""chase"" through the bombed out ruins of BERLIN is clearly a highlight of this movie~ The plot is a little thin but this spy yarn is pretty good from the first scene of a man being tossed off a train to the FBI showing us how they managed to tail and spy on the REDS living her in the USA~ Glad they finally released this on DVD~ one of the BETTER ~ RED SCARE movies. also try WALK EAST ON BEACON. ** THIS HAS some narration so I would call this a docu-drama. ***",1423267200,,1446,4.1535714285714285
8424477,3,B004CZZZ9A,"This one was a happy surprise for me, being as it is a competent quasi-noir/ semi-documentary along the lines of Assignment Paris and I Married a Communist/The Woman on Pier 13. Borgnine is surprisingly effective in the unlikely role of movie producer who moonlights as a good guy spy. Was this filmed on location? It sure looks that way with the seedy Berlin environs. BTW great, intrusive score by George Duning. And always fun seeing Alexander Scourby play an effete character, in this case of course a commie villain.",1422057600,,521,4.865168539325842
8424478,3,B004CZZZ9A,It's propaganda all right but filmed with class by Andr de Toth. We even have the right to see Russian people having fun in the streets of Moscow. Ernest Borgnine is perfect in the role of Boris Metrov. Recommended to curious ones.,1322697600,,231,4.523809523809524
