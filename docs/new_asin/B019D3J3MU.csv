8744759,1,B019D3J3MU,"This is a steaming pile. Even if you typically watch D-list horror schlock, this ""film"" is a few levels below that. Granted there is one solid kill in it right at the beginning, but after that the charm wears off fast. Shot on a VHS camcorder the picture quality is terrible and the sound quality is worse. There are much more fun ""so bad it's good"" horror movies out there to spend your time watching. Give this one a hard pass.",1492214400,2,429,4.308641975308642
8744760,5,B019D3J3MU,"If you think SLEDGEHAMMER and BOARDINGHOUSE are SOV trash, then you ain't seen nothin' yet. The mind-blowing cheapness of GORE WHORE is gonna make you mess yourself! When a lab assistant steals a formula, a doctor hires a deadbeat private eye to locate it. Soon the P.I. discovers the lab assistant is actually a dead street whore and the formula is a reanimation agent that, along with the consumption of severed human penises, is keeping her alive! Did I mention that she turns people into zombies by injecting them with the formula using a dildo? This movie features the kind of nudity that's usually reserved for porno, lots of wacky blood and guts (naturally), wooden acting, weird ""punk"" music, terrible sound quality and video quality so poor that in many scenes the top of the image has film warp. All of this combines to make a truly wonderful grindhouse experience. Those involved with the film should be proud, because they made a very entertaining piece of trash cinema with very little resources. It's amazing that this movie exists, and even more amazing that it (as well as director Hugh Gallager's other ""gore"" films) is finally available on DVD. I seriously love this movie and when I grow up I want to marry the Gore Whore, even if she does have a concave chest.",1484352000,6,1280,4.744394618834081

8744765,5,B019D3J3MU,"Oh Gore Whore, I never thought you would get a DVD release. I like this movie alot. I stumbled upon this movie in the very early 2000s on ebay on VHS. The cover for it was amazing I had to buy it. The movie itself is very low budget and the acting well it's not quite there. It's definitely a low budget SOV (Shot on Video) movie. But it's out there bizarre wierd, it's got nudity, a zombie, a car crash, some fun gore. Has an audio commentary and a short interview with the director. Is this movie for you...maybe. if you like super low budget SOV movies and can this for $9.95 go for it. Just don't expect the world and have fun watching it.",1461974400,8,643,4.111111111111111
8744766,5,B019D3J3MU,"Lately, I've been really into shot-on-video/old school super low budget horror flicks.  It's a tough game to play, because there are so many terrible movies littering the field in this genre, but there's also gems.  I would argue Gore Whore is a gem.

One, the movie is super gritty and nasty feeling. There are fun/funny scenes of over-the-top gore.  The movie moves fast.  Something is always happening, whether it be nudity, gore, and funny dialogue and even a car crash.  By the end of it, I felt like I watched a worthy mega low budget movie that manages to deal with its shortcomings and still make something enjoyable to watch.  Very nasty in parts.

The back of the DVD doesn't mention this, but there's a good audio commentary from the director and an informative on camera interview with the director as well.  I feel like Gore Whore is the real deal for fans of this genre.",1461196800,12,884,4.615384615384615
