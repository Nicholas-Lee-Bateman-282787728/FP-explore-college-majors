8657738,5,B00KD5LZZQ,"Laura Carrot and Junior Asparagus want to save Celery Park from being developed, and hit upon the idea of reuniting that fantastic old Disco band, The Groovy Brothers. But, it soon becomes apparent that each of the band members holds grudges from the breakup. Now, Laura and her grandpa Lanny Wilson (Larry the Cucumber) must set on a voyage of forgiveness if they are to set everything straight.

I have been a fan of Veggie Tales since I first saw Where's God When I'm S-Scared? when it was new! Now, I must say that some of the videos are better than others, but Celery Night Fever is one of their best ever! The storyline is funny and well-crafted, with a lot of great humor and a fantastic lesson. Also, the music is awesome (listen to it with headphones).

Veggie Tales has done a great job of spoofing movies or television shows or whatnot, and this one is a great send-up of Saturday Night Fever. It really was fun and funny in so many ways. Plus, I really liked that the movie is completely family-oriented and is not only something you can watch with the little-ones, but something you will WANT to watch with them.

Yeah, this is another great Veggie Tale, one that you should watch with your family  you will all love it!",1463097600,2,1233,4.491071428571429
