188528,5,1572523018,"A great movie for the woman just who thinks that she is a lesbian, or for an audience who is interested in a lesbian ""Gone With The Wind.""...the coming out issues are intriquingly true. Although to some the missing elements of women of color and gay rights is ommitted, the story still envelops all women...in all communities. The excessive drinking of the Claire character is a reminder of the writer/director Nicole Conns past life, and is necessary to show for the fact that this is the way Claire deals with her unhappiness in life.  Great scenery, great soundtrack, and above all, a cast that became a family on the set while filming the movie.  I had the pleasure of meeting Nicole Conn several years ago, and she is a delightfully charasmatic, strong lesbian that has really grown due to this movie.  It allowed her to throw away any demons she had in her closet, so to speak, and focus on the main issue, which was love:  sheer and utter love.  A great movie.  Keep!  up the good work Nicole!!

My wife and I couldn't even finish watching and turned off the disc before reaching the end. The lesbian characters were pompous and self-important, spouting off with painfully pretentious self-congratulations on being such special swowflakes because they were women who loved other women.

188551,4,1572523018,"I saw the film for the first time last week, and watched it again a few days later to balance first impressions.

The film is essentially about two quite different characters, Dr Noel Benedict and Claire Jabrowski, who meet at a writer's retreat and are attracted despite their discordant backgrounds and values. The dynamics of that relationship form the core of the film and are quite well conveyed.  For that reason alone the picture is worth seeing. Karen Trumbo is superb as Noel and Trisha Todd also won my affections in her role as Claire.  She had some of the worst lines  but is  excellent in some moments and I picked those up with delight.

It is unusual still to see such such overt sexual tension between women  in a film and must have been quite radical at the time (1992).  Some moments in the  development of that relationship are nicely captured and stay with you, always a good sign in a film.  The dialogue and acting are a little stilted at times but on the second viewing I came to see this as quite 'high camp' and and it added to my enjoyment.

I identify with the period too.  The clothes and customs are familiar and although my social scene was very different  from that in the film I still enjoyed it.  Noel and Claire were less stereotypical than the makers of the film, I thought, going on the secondary material also available in this DVD. To some degree they appear to be objects of fantasy in their own way  but I actually knew women very like these two.  Both are stunning.

The natural setting of the picture is beautiful and perfectly supports the lyrical fantasy of the relationship between the two women.  That is the power of this film. Anyone who has fallen in love with another woman will recognise with a thrill  that unique tension and curiosity.

I've read other quite negative criticisms of this film but if you locate it in its time and social context and suspend contemporary judgements you will enjoy it immensely.  The film  was made with limited resources which could explain some of the rougher edges but in a strange way these add to the appeal for me.",1391385600,4,2103,4.537234042553192

It deserves an honored place on the shelf next to your overly-viewed copy of  2010's ""Elena Undone"" if you're anything like me.  The soundtrack is fantastic, though, running from classical piano thru C & W, and  the best is a really juicy Teresa Trull song, ""Would It Hurt?""  No, it wouldn't, but you'll be sorry if you pass on this, at least for rental.  Nicole Conn understands how to write and stage believable seduction scenes.

188583,1,1572523018,"Claire of the Moon: 2 out of 10: This is why women's studies majors shouldn't be allowed to write and direct films. Of course woman's studies does not actually study all woman as woman have opinions and accomplishments as varied as men. Woman's studies courses as pointed out by Professors Dapne Patai and Noretta Koertgein `Professing Feminism: Cautionary Tales from the Strange World of Women's Studies' are more interested in ""the political mission of training feminist cadres to override educational concerns. The strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions.""

Woman's studies is an exercise in a particular group-think that attacks freedom as a whole and the freedom of woman in particular. Claire of the Moon is full of long anti-woman diatribes basically claiming straight woman are undermining the feminist movement (this is assuming there are any straight feminists left mind you). The movie was directed by a woman, so of course so this anti-woman point of view is okay. This is the Precious rule where as long as you are a member of a group you can make a film that drags out every horrible stereotype about said group and will be praised for it. Now had the exact same film had been written and directed by a straight white male, people would have burned the theater down.

This politically correct nonsense really should not effect the enjoyment of a film as one can be pro nuclear power and still enjoy Godzilla as an example. Claire of the Moon however has much bigger problems than its absolutist point of view.

Claire of the Moon's plot consists of two woman who become roommates at an all woman writer's retreat (one would think a writer's retreat would have individual rooms. This however is never examined.) Our titular protagonist Claire Jabrowski (Trisha Todd) is a drunk woman (Think Sherrybaby) who is sloppy, sleeps with creepy men at the drop of a hat and passes for a writer in the way that Tara Reid is convincing as a brainy anthropologist in Alone in the Dark. Playing Felix to Todd's Oscar is Karen Trumbo who plays a successful lesbian writer who is very butch and a neat freak. They hate each other on sight so it's going to be a long tedious ride before the inevitable hook-up sex.

Claire of The Moon tells this story in the form of three films mashed together: A haranguing lecture, A romantic novel and a soft core porn film.

The haranguing lecture is easily the worst part. The actresses are all amateur and read their overwrought screeds with a talent that varies from awful, to god awful, to good God make it stop I will join your cult and renounce my evil heterosexual ways awful. The romance novel bits consist of endless shots of sunsets and driftwood on various Oregon beaches while a piano tinkers in the background. You remember how seemingly every movie in the early seventies would stop the story outright and go all soft focus while a folk song played in your ears? Claire of the Moon is kind of like that but without the warbling.

The soft-core sex is what hopefully attracts both enlightened females and straight males to the movie. (I say hopefully because if you came for the acting or the story you are in for a world of hurt.) Our hook up sex partners (sorry romantic leads) are as stated above Trisha Todd who never made a another movie, teaches drama at Grant High in Portland, looks a little like Laura Dern, she is easily the best actress of the bunch, and whose nudity is the sole reason the film wasn't rated one out of 10. The other main lead Karen Trumbo has found some roles since Claire, she looks a little like Sigourney Weaver if Sigourney had a breast reduction and a little boy's haircut, and she convincingly plays a butch lesbian.

The sex scene comes in the last ten minutes of the film and it is decent as these things go (though it certainly not worth watching the rest of the film for). It also has the great advantage however of having no dialogue, and is more enjoyable if you don't know the characters. In other words this is the reason God created the fast forward button.",1270425600,3,4263,4.721774193548387
188584,5,1572523018,"I really enjoyed this film. No, it is not the best movie ever made, but, it's a cool flick to watch when you might be feeling down. This movie for sure kept Levi's in business. I guess lesbians only wore jeans in the early 90's...don't know. I did not understand why they kept Claire in the jeans during the love scene. But, for all of the negatives that others have mentioned, you have to see this movie just for Maggie's character alone. I felt that if it were not for Maggie (she renminds me of Dorothy from Golden Girls; quick whit), this movie would have really dragged on. The other characters reminded me of the ""Golden Girls"" characters. The southerner (Tara is the Blanche Devereaux), the suburban housewife (Rose), the crazy spiritual lady (she reminded me of Sophia of Golden Girls), and the substitute teacher-ish looking lady (Dorothy).

It's not well made, not well written or well acted, but if you can see past all that and release your mind into the realm of pure fantasy Noel and Claire make for a great first time story. In fact, if Noel looked like Xena and Claire looked like Gabriel, it would be the average Xena uberfic.

So watch it, but do so with an open mind and don't expect it to be great cinema. It's more like a guilty pleasure on a rainy day in your bathrobe.",1225929600,,547,3.918918918918919
188588,1,1572523018,"This movie is truly one of the worst I've ever seen (though it's better than Conn's other movie Cynara, but I digress).  The acting is atrocious.  The writing is abysmal.  Clearly, Conn and the actress playing Tara O'Hara have never actually met someone from the American South much less from Atlanta.  The word ""y'all"" is a contraction of the phrase ""you all.""  It is a plural pronoun.  It is not used in the singular.  Moreover, those of us who are from Atlanta have gentle Southern accents, if any at all.

I'm mentioning the Southern stereotype in the film, because that's the one that offended me the most, but EVERY character was a stereotype--the New Age guru, the pop psychologist, the housewife-turned-writer, the butch lezzie, etc.  Ugh!  And the tripe that comes out of their mouths!

There's so much back-and-forth between the two main characters that by the end of the movie when they finally hook up (and we still don't know why that time was THE time they finally gave in) the viewer doesn't care.  I really, really would love for Conn to take a couple of writing courses or just read a book about developing plot and characters.  In film, especially, every scene must count and be building toward the big payoff.  Too many scenes in this movie had no real purpose or served the same purpose as an earlier scene.  The characters must be fresh and real, not like the trite, wooden women who people this movie.  For a look at movies with great writing and acting, check out Imagine Me and You and Fingersmith.

In the ""making of"" tape, Conn describes the actress who plays Maggie as some sort of female Clark Gable - UGH!  Wrinkled up truck driver with an overbite..not suave and sexy!  The guy that Claire kept ""doing it"" with was annoying the heck out of me.

What I liked: the fact that Karen Trumbo is so sexy is about all that saved it for me.  (except, did anyone notice that she kisses like she's about to swallow the other person whole??)  I also liked the stretch when they began to find peace with each other and became friends.  The fantasizing about each other was cool...

We follow Claire's process from defining herself as a straight girl with many male partners, to becoming the lover of her female cabin mate at a writer's seminar. The movie depicts wonderfully the struggle Claire goes through and that is what makes this movie worth watching again and again. Another thing that makes this movie worth watching is the character Maggie. She is a strong character and the acting is GREAT. I would characterize Maggie as soft butch and that is rare to find in any film about lesbians. I love watching beautiful woman as much as the next person, but Maggie is a real life character that adds to this movie and I wish that more movie makers would celebrate diversity.",1162512000,,808,4.618055555555555

I seen worse from major studios.  Next to Showgirls, this movie is Oscar material (yeah, that's a backhanded compliment).  Really, there were times that the acting of the two main characters was so wooden, you could carve a toy gun.  They, would follow it up in the next scene, that made me scratch my head - the acting would be quite good.  Go figure...  I will say that some of the sex scenes were just dead on hot ... and the build-up of the tension, just dead bang on the mark.

Where it was the worse was those neverending shots of the characters doing the pensive stare out the window - way to long.

The bonus disk was great.  I watched it first this time and that made me go back to watch the movie again.  There was stuff in the bonus disk that didn't make it to the movie, too bad.

188613,1,1572523018,"I gave this movie a 1, but it's a 5 on the unintentional comedy scale. There is enough stilted dialogue, cliches and bad acting in this movie to embarrass William Shatner.

There were some strange things going on in this movie:

-> Even though the women are at a casual writer's retreat out in the woods, they all dress up exactly like they would back home. Why? So you can decipher their personalities in a hurry, without a lot of messy character development. I especially like how the Doctor dresses up every morning to sit at her typewriter. Nice shoulder pads!

-> Clair doesn't write a word the entire movie. She drinks, smokes, stares out the window, smokes some more, drinks a lot more, takes some aspirin, makes coffee, and then stares out the window some more. To break up the monotony, she occasionally walks on the beach and smokes. And she goes into town to drink and smoke.

-> The two main characters almost have sex 26 times. By the time they finally do it, you don't care.

-> One character states ""sex between two women is about as raw as it gets."" Maybe, but then why does Clair still have her jeans on during most of the final scene?

Sadly most have merit, the dialogue lacks cohesion, the characters are frustratingly under developed and the final love scene is reminiscent of low budget porn. But the curious thread, which most positive reviewers have in common, is that they can't pinpoint why this film, despite its obvious flaws, is so compelling. It most likely has to do with Todd and Trumbo, who rise above a lack-lustre script and some appalling supportive acting, to maintain the subtle line of sexual tension between the leading characters. This is achieved not by means of dialogue, but by way of telling glances and loaded eye contact. Claire of the Moon will disappoint those who expect cinema nouveau, but it's merit in exploring the myriad of potential interactions between women, be they gay or straight, can't be summarily dismissed.",1113350400,8,905,5.121621621621622

From the stiff acting, to the pedantic dialog, to the stereotypical characters, to the predictable, contrived plot set-ups -- it was just ALL BAD.  Well, okay, the music was good, and there was a five minute sex scene with nudity at the end that had some merit, but take my advice and don't waste your time on the movie.  Just fast-forward to the sex and then turn it off!

If you're a woman who is just coming out or thinking about coming out, maybe you'd be titillated by the cat and mouse game played by the two completely mismatched leading characters.  But anyone who's been out for more than five minutes would have to be extremely isolated to take this movie seriously.

I also must mention that everybody in this film, especially the leading ladies, drinks alcohol from morning to night.  I like a drink every now and then myself, but the degree of alcohol consumption here was over the top.  The message seemed clear:  these women were unable to interact with one another unless they were drunk.  Gross.

I was wrong.  THIS movie showed its characters dancing to a blaring, generic, keyboard-heavy, Eighties-style rock anthem.
The above scene epitomizes how badly this movie has aged since 1992.  I can understand how the filmmakers would want to counteract the era's cinematic Sapphic stereotypes; at least the movie contains no lesbian killers, or no silicone-enhanced lesbian sexbombs who get it on to arouse straight male viewers.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers instead offer equal parts pseudo-intellectualism (stilted Mars/Venus-style conversations about sexual roles) and watered-down cool (embarrassing MTV-style sexual fantasies).  This ""unrated"" movie even waters down its sex scenes, going to comical lengths to conceal crotches and buttocks, apparently to avoid controversy and guarantee a mainstream audience.

This is a perfect movie if you suffer from insomnia and are trying to wean yourself from sleeping pills...you can go cold turkey watching this movie. The only reason I rated the film ""1 star"" is that ""0 star"" was not an option.
The film is painfully slow and excruciatingly predicatable.  The storyline is weak, the dialogue flat, and the acting uninspired.
The movie contains only ridiculous messages:
1.  Women who attend activities for women must be lesbians or  latent lesbians (now, that's plainly absurd);
2.  lesbians speak insipid platitudes of redundant rhetoric (that writers at a workshop wou;d discuss this topic only is just silly);
3.  straight women really wish to be lesbians and will just suddenly change sexual orientation (get real!).
The plot is likely to be CHEEZY to any person, INSULTING to any thinking woman, and PATHETIC to any lesbian.  As such, I am EMBARRASSED that lesbians (and the one straight woman) are portrayed SO stereotypically and shallow by the film's creators.

Having been in the ""scene"" for some time now, I am not enamored of the ""Oh my God, am I gay or not, I'm so confused"" personality. Been with them, done with them.
Trisha Todd gave a very believable performance of this type of torn individual. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast's screen time could have been cut - dramatically. I could never really understand what the ""hostess"" was trying to achieve. The living room chats were so vague as to be annoying, but I got the distinct impression that the entire purpose of the ""workshop"" was to convert the homophobic straight women, and get the two leads together.

188720,1,1572523018,"What a disappointment this film was. Lesbian movies are few and far between so we often grasp at anything that portrays our lifestyle. Don't waste your money on this one. The acting is wooden, the story predictable  and the characters, well, words just can't express how unbelievable they  all are. My one star goes to Michael Allen Harrison for the musical score,  some really nice piano playing.",948672000,2,397,4.895522388059701
188721,5,1572523018,This movie is my favorite.  It's the best lesbian flick i've seen yet.  I've seen it over a dozen times and thought i should buy it instead of renting it all the time.,948499200,2,167,4.03030303030303
188722,2,1572523018,"I originally rented this video becasue I thought it was a hetereo love story.  I had just moved to Alaska from the Oregon coast.  The filmming was done in the community where I lived, and,being homesick, really enjoyed the  sceneray.  I fastforwarded through the story just to see whose home would  be used next.  Funny thing, I have never met anyone who knew an art film  was being filmed on their beach.  I watched it a second and third time to  see weather, clouds, tide lines, and tidal debris.
I agree with the  inaneness of the story.  Too silly and slow.",947289600,2,561,4.455445544554456
188723,1,1572523018,"I really was hoping for more in the exploration of women's sexuality.  Instead, I was disappointed in the acting, plot, and intent of this movie.  The plot was predictable... women gathering for a writer's workshop, and  two find an attraction.  But the characters were almost cartoonish, broad  characterizations with no substance.... the romance writer, the dyke, the  one who's husband leaves.... boring!
Women's sexuality and lesbianism are  such complex subjects and this movie avoided all the issues.  Our society  is filled with such critical  misnomers about same-gender relationships,  and this movie does nothing to clear the air.  It only adds to the  sterotypes, rather than demonstrating a healthy attitude.",944956800,3,720,5.495412844036697
188724,1,1572523018,"This movie was beautifully filmed.  If I were to rate it on its production value, it would be 5 stars. The crew did a wonderful job. However, while some of the actors are just fine, others (particularly one of the leads) is  wooden. Part of this may be due to the script, which seems stilted and  preachy at times. While the film does have its moments (primarily where  there's no dialogue), it is usually mediocre. I really hated this movie.  I  recommend that you buy Desert Hearts instead.",943142400,7,492,4.534090909090909

7797480,5,1572523018,"Let me suggest that the inept Amazon review not only misses the point of the film, they can't even get the names of the characters correct. Further, they omit the fact that the film garnered several awards and made Nicole Conn one of the top 10 most admired and powerful lesbians in the business. If you are going to write a review of a film, one should get their facts in order. Also, Trisha Todd starred in the film, but Ms Conn wrote, produced and directed it. Again, incorrect facts . Maybe the reviewer for Amazon should take advantage of their tuition assistance and  re-educate themselves in another line of work! Just saying.......",1502409600,,639,4.654867256637168
7797481,4,1572523018,"I recently purchased this film and was not so interested at first. I have watched it multiple times since and have come to revise my first impression. The difference of the two lead characters are in step of actual life experiences. Opposites do attract :). It also made me aware of how much work goes in to creating, developing, producing, and directing a film such as this or any film. I will continue to enjoy this film in the future.",1485907200,,437,4.475
7797482,5,1572523018,"I found this movie most interesting.  Very different approach to a developing love between these two women. How Claire manages to keep up with Noel and doing her best to break down the barrier between them.  Must listen to the conversations.  The movie is well done, not really graphic until the very end.  Both Trisha and Karen did a great job.  Kudos to both.  Those who enjoyed this story will enjoy Elena Undone.  Both are from Nichole Conn.",1485043200,2,445,4.628205128205129

The movie is a deep search into women's soul, the search for reality and the discovery of intimacy and true love.
