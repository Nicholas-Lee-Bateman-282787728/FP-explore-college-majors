8247495,5,B0012RD3X6,The story line although short in nature is very good. The fight sequence  are not as great as the video game but are still good. If you are a fan of anime is a good collection to have.,1285545600,,184,3.8421052631578947
8247496,5,B0012RD3X6,"I love this series.  It is the best thing they could have done with the game.  I have loved playing this game and the animation was just a step up for the games.  The storyline is great.  As bloody as the game, and with the same quips.  I loved how they captured the character from the games to perfection.  I recommend this series, you will love it.  It has great action and animation.",1252800000,,386,4.205479452054795
8247497,4,B0012RD3X6,"Was very impressed with the first two volumes of this anime.  It's been a while since something extremely well drawn with a decent plot has came out in a while(as far as anime is concerned).  I highly suggest that fans of the Devil May Cry games or if you are into anime like ScryEd, Vandread and formats of such check it out.  I would give the anime a five star but there is definitly a small lack in character build up.  I think this is due to the fact that Dante, Lady and the rest are already established characters in the gaming world.",1216080000,,540,4.213592233009709
8247498,5,B0012RD3X6,Let me just say that after i watch this 2nd DVD i just wanted to see more and more! The first episode was funny as hell but the rest episodes were just awesome! The story keeps going deeper about what is really happening with that girl Dante is protecting.. A familiar face makes a return from the 1st episode and we also get to learn some of Dante's backround.. Devil May Cry Vol. 2 is actually better than Vol. 1!! Buy it.,1215561600,4,424,4.182926829268292
8247499,5,B0012RD3X6,"When I saw ADV(thought to be dead) as the localization team for this series I was suprised after they gave up Full Metal Panic like they were going out of business. This DVD box set is worth it even if it didn't come with a DVD box for Vol 1 which I got from Devil May Cry 4. Unfourtunately,the story takes place after the other Devil May Cry (sorry folks Virgil won't make an apperance)games and leads into 4 well(continue watching to find out what I'm talking about) . I recommend this to those who like horror and ""strawberry sundaes"".",1214179200,,538,4.39
8247500,5,B0012RD3X6,"The Devil May Cry Series on the consoles has had a well earned reputation of being stylish and taxing on the thumbs.  While the anime doesn't touch the thumbs, (except the remote) it is heavy on style.  It never fails to be interesting, even if the episode starts out slow, it will pick up.  The only thing that I would like to see more is how Trish fits into things, as she has been in one episode so far.  Plot is not exactly deep, (if you are looking for plot, go seek War and Peace) but ultra heavy on action.  The box was a nice touch, as it will be nice to have a decently constructed holder for when I receive the third and last in this series.  Overall, been very pleased with how they have done the animation and action.  It was a nice touch having the same voice actor do Dante's voice in the U.S. dub that also voices the devil hunter in the third and fourth games.  All in all, money well spent.  Now, if they will be kind of enough to hurry up and release the third, all will be good.",1212969600,,997,4.0717948717948715
8247501,4,B0012RD3X6,"Devil May Cry level 2 is creepier and darker than the previous level. With episodes filled with swearing, blood gushing demons,and Dante near to denying his own past. I laughed,got creeped out,and loved every minute of it. My only disappointment is that the art box that came with the dvd was just a pretty box with no inserts or anything else.",1210982400,,344,4.655737704918033
8247502,5,B0012RD3X6,"This was a fun bloody and funny and gorey fun, there is no animation i like better then strong action bloody violence and this is what it is. This is funny to and very fun to watch this is a awsome series witch is very great that they brought up with great characters terrifying storyline and bloody guts spiling out fun. I just love animation with strong bloody violence like this its very fun to watch and you can watch it over and over and over again its so fun to watch, this is a animation  with great voice actors well of course its from ADV films but this is a hot animation. The creature demons are so awsome looking the graphic is wonderfull to, and being that i have a big HD TV its even more better with soundng and crazy action awsome series. Justin cause did an exellent voice of dante, and hilary haag did a fun cute voice of patty like always in her animation but this was a fun animation i can't untill level3 comes out this was awsome fun. The demons are terrifying looking with great effect and design, this animation alone is just amazing with a great story and the whole story to, now you can step deeper inside the bloody truth behind dante's most dangerous missions. And these cases are even more lead filled and blood drenched then the last. Theres the demonic face behind the mafia. A rock star siren who'd sell her soul for a hit song. A lowly fisherman who reels in a satanically sinister catch. And a man who succumbs to dark purposes to fulfill a noble goal to shocking results. With more monsters, hooter babes, and more brutal battles, this is the most exciting anime series based on any game ever. Don't miss part two of the awsome Devil May Cry animated trilogy, this is a very fun series.",1208390400,4,1721,4.361370716510903
