7868652,5,6304288069,"If you're not a fan of the whole crossover pop/disco-meets-classical concept you won't enjoy this video.  Mae's playing is exceptional from the standpoint of technical ability, even if her tone and artistic expression are lacking from a purist's perspective.  Mae is an entertainer, and a good one at that.  She's incredibly comfortable in front of a crowd, smiling and waving and setting up her next tune with the grace of a woman twice her age (she was about 16 at the time of this performance).  The arrangements of her pieces (most are the work of her producer Mike Batt, who also does production and arrangements for Bond) are well conceived, especially that of Bach's Tocotta and Fugue in D Minor which launched her into stardom.  My favorite number was the electric violin version of Paganini's 24th caprice, accompanied by a mean electric guitar.  Video and audio quality are good, although like the other reviewer I would have preferred to experience this concert on DVD.  Many of the pop tunes are accompanied by a couple of dancers, which I saw as a bit too cheesy but I suppose it worked well for the live audience.  The musicians are first rate, including several well known session players, a string section for the classical numbers, and Mae's mother Pam on piano.  The whole thing comes off as sort of a Branson-meets-London extravoganza.  If you're a Vanessa Mae fan this is a must have.",1074643200,,1404,4.8125
7868653,2,6304288069,"Give me a break!  Okay, so she has some ""cross-over"" appeal, but what does she really stand for?  I always hear or read comments like ""this is classical music for people who don't like classical music.""  Rhetorically, one could then say ""this is, therefore, NOT the kind of classical music for those who DO like classical music.""  She's hot, but seriously, if I close my eyes and just listen to her playing, it does nothing for me.  Actually, this ""classical-rock-jazz-cabaret"" fusion grows annoying after a bit.  She's a great PERFORMER rather than musician, and realizes her limitations and spices it up with sex appeal.  The recordings of her playing straight up classical compositions blaringly show her deficiencies:  all superficial like her tight costumes, and lacking any sort of deep identification with the music.  There are soooooo many better violinists out there, I really can't see how anyone could say Vanessa Mae is worth spending the time and money to listen to.  I give her two stars instead of one, because I am a sexist male and she is a good looking woman.",1007596800,3,1077,4.868131868131868
7868654,5,6304288069,"Vanessa-Mae's performance at the Royal Albert Hall was one of the best concerts that I have seen in a long time.  With a blend of both Classical and contemporary compositions, Vanessa-Mae's performance can satisfy music lovers of any persuasion.  Full of passion, this video is a must-see for anyone who loves the sound of the violin, regardless of genre.
Also, for those of you (like myself) who might never get an opportunity to see Vanessa-Mae live, this is the next best thing.  The sound and picture quality of the VHS tape was great, although I believe that the performance can be even better on DVD.  I can only hope that good fortune can make my wish come true.",992822400,4,669,4.6440677966101696
7868655,5,6304288069,"If there's anything sad about this video, it's that it still doesn't seem to be available on DVD.  I've been buying her CD's ever since her phenomenal Violin Player, and both my wife and I still listen to that CD frequently, along with her other albums.
We had the amazing luck to actually see Vanessa Mae perform live in Vail, Colorado, a couple of years ago.  To put it simply, she brought the house down with her stunning performance.  We still talk about how great it would be if she were to come back again sometime to grace us with her talent and lively stage presence.
I have hundreds of both classical and pop albums, and Vanessa Mae epitomizes what it takes for an artist to appeal to both sides of that musical coin.  For those who posted that they didn't like the Red Hot Tour video, I feel sorry for you that you can't appreciate such a fun experience.  Lighten up!",984528000,3,877,4.388888888888889
7868656,5,6304288069,"One word about this video.  Awesome.  If you're a Vanessa-Mae fan, this is a must have.  If not, you'll become one after watching it.  Her style is excellent.  I've never seen another violinist play with such energy.  The  violin appears live in her hands.  If you've only heard her music but never  have had the chance to see her perform, then you are definitely missing  out.  The other musicians are excellent as well and do a great job of  contributing to the energy of this concert.  Most of the video is  pop-fusion, but there are some classical pieces in the middle.  All the  music is great.  Some songs such as Cotton Eye Joe, and Caprice No. 24 can  only be heard through this video as they aren't available on CD, at least  not in the U.S.  Her live version of Aurora is also played a little  differently and in my opinion sounds better than the one on her Storm  album.  Red Hot also sounds better live.  I happen to own the Berlin Video  as well.  Between the 2, I'd say this is the better one because of it's  high energy feel.  However both are great and I'd recommend buying both.  You won't be disappointed.  So do yourself a favor and check it out!",954288000,19,1166,4.338028169014085
7868657,5,6304288069,I just got to see a small portion of this concert on BRAVO TV and this lady just knocked my socks off this is an absolute must for people who need to mix some rock with their classical this wonderful voilin player has  captured my heart and interest and I plan to add this video to my video  music collection and I know it will get played a lot. I hope we get to see  more of this young ladies playing.,954288000,8,402,3.9382716049382718
7868658,1,6304288069,"Vanessa-Mae is one of these ""child prodigy's"" that  never developed.  While she posesses great technical skill, she lacks an understanding of the music and is therefore unable to make meaningful  interpretations.  To compensate, Vanessa-Mae has opted for what I call  ""classical-pop"" - classically based music spiced up to  ""wow"" the listener.  I'm sure there's a place for this style of  music, but I find it trite and shallow and I shall not allot any of my  shelf space for this video.",948240000,6,488,4.925925925925926
7868659,3,6304288069,"A wonderful performance by a VERY talented young lady.  Her music is great, her presentation is outstanding.  It is an inspiration for young people to see a beautiful instrument put to such great use by a beautiful  musician.  I hope that they are given to continue their studies after  viewing this performance.  The transistion from jazz to classical was  great, her talent is overwhelming.  Can not wait to see the Berlin  Performance!",944006400,7,438,4.972222222222222
7868660,5,6304288069,This is an incredible concert! I would recommend this to anyone who likes Vanessa Mae. She makes her music exciting and she actually looks like she is enjoying herself on stage. Every song is great! This makes me want to  purchase her other video.,933724800,9,247,4.613636363636363
