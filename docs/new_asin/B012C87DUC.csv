8726007,2,B012C87DUC,"I was quite disappointed in this show, for a number of reasons. It has a boring sameness in every
episode, with ""Master"" and the girls' pet alligator chasing Izumi, little sister proposing yet another
contest between them, and Master trying to sneak nude photos of the girls.

Unlike the ""perv"" type heroes in other shows like Heaven's Lost Property and High School DXD,
Master has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Add in the fact that the girls he blackmails into
becoming his maids are both in middle school, and his inappropriate attentions are even creepier.

But surely he will see the error of his ways, he will start treating him maids better, and friendship
will bloom. Err, don't count on it. I did, and it was the only thing that kept me watching at all.

Save your time and money and skip this one.",1458086400,,811,4.6573426573426575
