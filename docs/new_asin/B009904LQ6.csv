5277578,3,B009904LQ6,"The core workout doesn't do much with a five pound kettlebell.  I'll have to try a ten pound kettlebell.  It was mostly tiring out my aching body without tightening the core.

The other workouts are perfect for more my thighs though.",1359504000,2,233,4.634146341463414
5277579,5,B009904LQ6,"I let myself get horribly out of shape.  Trying to get back in shape defies the laws of physics...you know bodies at rest tend to stay at rest.  Trying to get my fat bod moving again is hard.  Some workout videos are so long and intense that it's easy to get discouraged and give up altogether.  This video has workouts divided into 60, 30, and 15 second sets with a countdown clock in the corner, so it helps to just go, okay 10 more seconds of this.  I think this video is awesome.  Just what I needed to get moving again.  When I started I couldn't get through the tutorial, and then when I could, I moved on to the combos and couldn't get through all those.  Now I am doing the combos all the way through.  Once I outgrow this video I will look for a longer more challenging vid.  But for beginners this was perfect!",1359244800,3,820,4.165605095541402
5277580,4,B009904LQ6,I love the step by step instruction provided in this dvd. Paul provides a great tutorial to gets you into the moves at a beginners pace. The tutorial is more than enough for a beginner to get a good workout until the beginner is ready to advance.,1359244800,,246,4.25531914893617
5277581,5,B009904LQ6,This is a good kettlebell workout. I am fairly new to kettlebells and I love this DVD. The core workout is awesome and left me sore for days - but a good kind of sore. The other two workouts are really good as well and they get your heart rate up so cardio is included without actually having to do additional cardio. I would recommend this to anybody that is into or wants to get into kettlebells.,1357776000,,398,4.181818181818182

Although I haven't started using it in earnest yet - because I don't have an appropriate kettlebell - I can see why it's considered a great exercise method.  Paul Katami stresses during the introduction that it's important to have the right weight kettlebell, but unless I missed it, he never says how to determine the best weight for an individual to choose (for safety, primarily).  Before I got the DVD, I bought a 20 pounder, but it's WAY too heavy to swing around, thus, nothing to use until I can go somewhere where there are lots of sizes for me to try out.  That advice would have made the DVD much perfect!",1492732800,8,784,4.492957746478873

If you are new to kettlebells, and want s good tutorial that will still give you a workout while giving the best pointers on how to use a kettlwbell effectively and SAFELY buy this DVD. The instructor is enthusiastic without being annoying and instructive without coming off as condescending. So why 4 stars instead of 5? Because if you're like me you know that 4 stars are the most trustworthy reviews to read when trying to decide. (Sometimes 5 stars point to a paid or fake review). Otherwise I would give it 5!",1487980800,,587,4.4953271028037385
5277628,5,B009904LQ6,"This workout DVD is great for beginners. I've used kettlebells with other workout DVDs like Jillian Michaels&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-Shred-It-With-Weight/dp/B004FUUS26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels: Shred-It With Weight</a>. Compared to Jillian, this workout is much slower and more focused on refining your technique. Depending on your fitness level, it can still get your heart pumping.

The workout might not be for everyone. If you already workout and have used kettlebells, these workouts are not going to challenge you. However, I recommend a viewing for anyone using kettlebells as there are important techniques that Paul Katami goes over ensure safe use and injury prevention.

Paul Katami is also one of my favorite workout trainers. He has a great stage, presence - very encouraging and he struggles alongside you.",1487376000,45,907,6.365853658536586
5277629,2,B009904LQ6,"I am over 40 years old and have FSH muscular dystrophy which affects mostly upper body muscles. I wanted to try the kettlebell to build some endurance and get back into an exercise routine, and tried 2 DVDs. NOTE: I used 3 pound hand weights to see if I could do the exercises before purchasing a kettlebell.
1. Kettlebell 3-in-1 with Amy Bento. HIGHLY recommend for beginners, or people not currently exercising. She has an advanced segment, that Im not sure if I can do, but the intro and beg. Workout was awesome! I was sweating and able to do the exercises. She explains things good. She also does 3 reps of everything, so you know what to expect. Only downfall (if any) is I don't think her sense of humor is all that great. Shes a little dry, but the music is good and its exactly what I need. Amy also shows how you can modify an exercise for more basic/more advanced people which is very helpful! I have bad knees, and this didn't bother my knees.
2. Ultimate Kettlebell workout for Beginners with Paul Katami. I would consider this workout INTERMEDIATE! He does shoulder things I cant do because I have a degenerated trapezius muscle. He does TONS of squats and lunges which bothered my knees. I am a person with knee problems, so Im not surprised. Paul is a wonderful instructor and has a great sense of humor/interesting to listen to and watch. This DVD is NOT for me, but thats because of my health issues and this NOT being a good fit for me. Overall, well done. He looks like a professional runner, and incorporates running into the cardiovascular which I cannot do. I know how to alter to marching or one leg side ways jumping jacks, but he gave no alternatives.",1485734400,,1677,4.483660130718954

What surprised me was how much of a workout each of these three workouts are including the instructional video. I've been using kettlebells for a few years now and I've learned some new moves. The main instructor has plenty of good tips and they will sink in once you've watched a few times and I highly suggest you listen carefully to his words.

The workout is fast moving but to me offered very little variety and I was challenged yet bored at the same time. I still got a solid workout and will do it again.

NOTE to true ""beginners"": If you have never done a lot of squats, this workout is 90% squats. If you are not used to doing squats, expect to hit pause by the 7 minute mark and be slumped over by the 27 minute mark. Haha! You will feel the burn!",1444867200,4,663,4.1395348837209305

If you're truly a beginner, start with a lighter weight so you can move around and swing comfortably without straining yourself. For a female, I'd suggest 5 pounds and for a guy, maybe 10 pounds but honestly. Just practice and if you're too exhausted or sore to finish the video, then try a lighter weight and then work up to heavier weights.

I read some reviews complaining about lower back problems and twists. I think you have to know you're own body and be realistic in what you can or should do. If you've never worked out and you're over 50, well, some moves will be difficult but it doesn't mean the video is bad, just that maybe kettlebell isn't meant for your body.

5277751,1,B009904LQ6,"As a new-ish kettle bell enthusiast I thought this would be a great addition to my KB DVD rotation.  Before I review this, I'll prelude with:  I have taken the dire warnings I've read about safety first in this sport very seriously.  While I don't have access to an accredited KB trainer, I did my homework, purchased Steve Cotter's KB Encyclopedia (FIRST RATE.  If you haven't checked out these DVDs, I can't express enough how informative and important these are!)  and have spent most of my workouts practicing perfect form over the past 4 months.  At 54, I'm not willing to risk any kind of back injury after watching those I love suffer for years from back injuries.  Sarah Lurie's workouts are serious on safety as well and I've learned a great deal from her.  I love her workouts.

Paul Katami is engaging and enthusiastic.  His introduction to basic moves was *okay*.  I got a decent workout during the instruction but not so much info about good form.  And NO, he never once mentioned the weights of the KBs.  And he, maybe ONCE, mentioned keeping the core firm and tense [so as to protect the lower back].  He barely mentions good breathing technique.

When I got to the actual workout, well that's when it just fell apart.  He did swings never covered in the instruction.  And they were weird!  He did them incredibly fast, one right after the other.  While I was trying to perform these moves that make you torque your back or twist WHILE LIFTING FROM THE FLOOR TO ABOVE YOUR HEAD, he never mentioned staying tight or tensing the core (although I tried to personally do this) but the exercises were just too fast to accomplish his moves safely.

I did this DVD today.  About 8 hours ago.  I understand good form and I tried to do that.  But my lower back is KILLING ME tonight.  Not the satisfied ""oh I really worked my muscles today"" but ""holy crap, I really strained my lower back today"" and I'm going for the Aleve.

I've never seen these types of swings on any of my other KB workouts.  The only thing I can figure is --it looked like the other ladies he was working out with were using VERY light KBs.  Like maybe 5 lbs?  I think that would be the only way you could get through this workout as fast as he was going with the extreme swings he was doing.  I tried to do my moves at a slower pace but I could NOT keep a safe form (if it was even possible).

I gave this one star.  For a cardio workout.  If you used a 5 lb KB or less, you could do this DVD for a cardio workout.  But I won't be doing this workout again, not even for cardio.",1440720000,18,2556,4.313684210526316

In my opinion it's great for beginners and not-so beginners.  Lots of options.  There are a lot of 30 second rest times which I used to rest when I first started but now I either continue during the rest time or do a few yoga stretches.  I highly recommend the Iron Core 4 DVD Work Out.,1435968000,,426,3.9186046511627906

I've noticed this with all of my kettlebell DVD's but I tend to continue the moves as Paul is explaining the next move. This is the only way to keep your heart rate up. It doesn't have a lot of cardio in it which is why I say it is for beginners. I love the 15 minute ab workout too.

The workout can really be as hard or as easy as you want it to be based on the weight of the kettlebell that you choose. I decided to start with a light 15lb kettlebell, and with this weight I still had a great workout to the point that the first couple times I was sore for a day or two afterwards.

I have experience with kettle bells and though I wouldn't consider myself an expert, I doubt any ""beginner"" would be able to complete this video straight through due to the continuous squatting for over 20 minutes straight.

I've worked out with kettlebells for a few years and have seen different DVDs.  I like the way Mr. Katami shows the moves and swings.  He gives good advice and you won't get hurt if you follow it.  The second work out is really nice.  It works every part of the body and I feel like I've accomplished something when I'm done.  I was pleased to find out that the last work out is actually do-able.  I was afraid it would be too difficult since I'm just intermediate in my ability, but I could do 90% of it.

Never heard of Paul before but he is a great communicator and he found a way to introduce plenty of pointers regarding security and posture without slowing down the video.

I noticed that there are a lot extreme cross-fit people in that field. It is cool to have someone who is not pretentious and just delivers the goods nicely.

It's a great DVD for beginners and intermediates. The pros can benefit as well as long as they use a heavier weight. Nice job!",1396742400,8,819,4.2243589743589745

I purchased a 12lb kettlebell (up from my 8lb) and tried this DVD today.  Wow!  I loved the workout, it was precise, easy to understand and pushed me using the 12lbs.  We'll see how sore I am tomorrow but for at least for today, I'm in love with this DVD!  I did the Drills & Combo routine this morning, it was 26 minutes including the warm-up and cool down.

Even though I have been using a kettlebell for over a year, I would definitely say these are beginner moves, nothing too complicated.  I feel Jillian's moves are much more advanced but with upping my kettlebell weight I didn't want to kill myself the first day.  :-)

Am now on the hunt for more Paul Katami DVDs as I love his training style, he pushes you but in a positive way.  I'm also glad I upped my kettlebell weight.  When I first took it out of the box it felt incredibly heavy compared to my 8lb but I made it through and was pretty proud!",1393891200,3,1016,4.158974358974359

After about 2 weeks, my knee pain had subsided and I was able to continue training for my race. This DVD is great therapy for those suffering from runner's knee.

Would I recommend this for a true beginner?  Probably not.  I think that Powerbody Kettlebell Bootcamp is much easier and less intense.  Of course, if you are already fit and starting out with Kettlebells, this might be the workout for you.  The instruction is fast - which I prefer.

5277885,5,B009904LQ6,"There are many positives about this video that I like over some of my other Kettlebell DVDs.  Paul Katami is a likable instructor and puts together a good workout for beginners and those looking to go into some intermediate exercises (combos).  As I am a intermediate kettlebell user, I went through the tutorial once and will probably never go back to it again.  I know a lot of reviews complain that he doesn't go over what ""weight"" you should start out with, but I think that's scary for a DVD to even suggest.  My best advice would be to start out what you consider to be a light weight until you get proper form down.  I do have to say that I have DVDs from Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, Paul Katami and Lauren Brooks and each instructor has a slightly different form for each exercise and I'm sure that someone's going to complain about form in each one of those DVDs.

My favorite parts about this DVD:
#1: There is a timer for each exercise (30 seconds, 60 seconds) so you always know how much time you have left
#2: There's a a drills & combinations section and a core section (each 25-30 minutes)
#3: He does two sets for each exercise",1379376000,5,1145,4.377358490566038

It is broken down into 3 segments - (1) tutorial on how to do the movements (2) the main workout (3) an abdominal workout. The tutorial workout, for those of you new to kettle bell, is a little challenging the first few go-rounds and left me sore the next day. The main workout consists of the movements in the tutorial just faster and in combination. The abdominal workout incorporates standing and seated exercise and, of course, gets arms in the mix too. I do the main workout most days of the week, as I stated, because it is only 30 minutes and gets a good sweat in that time. I do the abdominal workout on days that I do other cardio such as elliptical or biking. I started out (and still) use a 15 lb kettlebell that I have found to be enough weight to safely do the workout while still making me ""feel it"".

My fiance just started doing kettlebells and this was his first workout. We both enjoyed the workout and we both felt the burn the next day and the day after. I only wish that there was a little more variation between the instructional section and the 1st actual workout. Also to me the first workout seems a bit too short and does not really concentrate on any upper body or core work. I know that there is a core section but most people like myself want a total workout in one session. I would have rather the 1st workout be a little longer and do some additional core work.,1376006400,5,755,4.4

This program is so easy to follow that in a week started using 15 lb KB and soon should ramp it up a little more.  You can feel your arms getting tone even if it will take longer than a few weeks to see much definition.  I have only been doing it twice a week for about a month.

The 2 girls with him are good although one has better form than the other, in my opinion.  I really, REALLY love the core routine.  Oh man! you can feel this one as you are doing it and you will feel it the next day.  The only reason I deducted 1 star is that I think he moves a bit too quickly from exercise to exercise and since this is supposed to be for beginners it should be a bit more transition time.

In the interests of full disclosure, I will say that my wife is a kettlebell snob, having worked out for several years in a gnarly local gym filled with competitive kettlebell weightlifters, some of whom have trained with international champions from Russia. I think they are all crazy people, but that's kind of the point. Anyway, kettlebell lifting is an old form of weightlifting, popular in Russia that basically involves swinging and hoisting cannonballs of various sizes and weights, lifting them up using thick metal handles that are molded into the tops of the ball.  It's a very taxing and dynamic -- and rather dangerous -- style of exercise.

This video, by trainer Paul Ketami, is not really a ""kettlebell"" routine.  That is, he's using smaller weights that are manufactured differently than proper kettlebells, and the exercises he's doing are not real kettlebell exercises, more like calisthenics with big weights.  It's probably just as well, since there seem to be a lot of injuries involved in the real sport, both from bells going off wild in the hands of exhausted, sweaty lifters, and from muscular strain, especially strain due to improper form. I would say that this video is okay for people who are mildly curious about the sport and want to try it out. However, I would not recommend this video as a substitute for an actual training program, particularly if you want to use heavier weights or more standard equipment (which is also recommended) and especially not if you want to compete -- this won't teach you the real routines.

Kettlebelling is a very strenuous and dangerous sport and if you're going to do it for real, you should look for an experienced trainer who has done it competitively and didn't just start doing it around the same time as you. Seriously. Proper form is very important, particularly with the more dramatic moves like the ""snatch"" and the strait-lined ""jerk"" (I didn't make these terms up, but the way) and if you do it wrong or learn bad habits it can really mess you up. Kettlebells is hard, as they like to say.  In short, you cold use this to see if you like this kind of workout, but don't rely on it as a real guide to the sport.",1369267200,,2234,4.757105943152455

Paul provides smooth instruction and the workouts give me a nice cardio and strength burn, and save a lot of time compared to going to the gym and fighting for its KBs.

I would recommend you also buy a set of four kettlebells so you have a weight that you can handle with proper form to start with, and then additional weights as you get stronger. I bought these:

5277932,4,B009904LQ6,"""Ultimate Kettlebell Workouts for Beginners"" is a good kettlebell workout video for those with some kettlebell experence. I have been using a kettlebell in my home gym for over a year and enjoy it as an occasional change to my normal cardio centric workout.

The video features instructor Paul Tatami and it is divided into three workout sections. The exercises generally make good use of the kettlebell and are paced just about right for mid to advanced users. Beginners will likely be frustrated with the lack of advise for selecting the right weight kettlebell for their needs and will almost certainly not be able to keep up with the program right away.

This is a good video for experienced kettlebell users.

5277933,5,B009904LQ6,Checked the other reviews.  Agree good workout.  Nice to have women who aren't America's next top model.  Emphasis of form.,1368403200,,123,5.05
5277934,4,B009904LQ6,This is an easy to follow kettleball work out. I've had a kettleball for several years but its been gathering dust since I had become bored with the moves I know. This took it up a notch for me and wasn't too difficult for me to keep up with. I'm in okay shape - but I'm heavy so many excercise routines don't accommodate my weight. I am able to follow or modify the excercises.,1368057600,,378,4.121621621621622
5277935,5,B009904LQ6,"Kettlebells became hot on the scene because you can burn twice as many calories, and work way more muscles than simply doing regular strength training or aerobic training alone. The reason is that the swings and movements create aerobic benefits and you use more muscles doing the moves than you would with ordinary strength training.

But the best part of kettlebell workouts is that they are actually really fun, which is hard to say about most workouts. Swinging the bell around doesn't feel like the usual boring workout, it's actually a fun thing to do that just happens to work you out like crazy.

Keep in mind that when doing a kettlebell, you are basically holding 2 dumbells. In fact, if you do lots of handweight training, you'll notice many moves are the same you'd do holding 2 handweights, but using the kettlebell makes them easier to hold. Because of this, using the weight of what your two dumbells would normally weigh, or a couple pounds less, usually finds the right weight for you. For example, if you are really out of shape and have never worked out, you might begin dumbell training with 2 two-pound weights, so you could use a 4 pound kettlebell. If you have some muscle tone you might use a 12 pound kettlebell etc.

Better yet, many kettlebells now are adjustable so that you can start with a lower number and add more weight as you develop muscle definition.

Now, on to the workout. Nicely done, and a very informed instructor. My main gripe is that it is assumed this will be the only workout you'll be using so you would start with the tutorial workout (a good workout in itself) and move up to the next levels. However, I workout by rotating several workouts (I have a library of over 100 workouts) and I've realized that the really well thought-out workouts incorporate the tutorials into the workout. For example, if you do a Jillian Michaels workout, she'll start a rep so that you know what you are doing, and while you are doing those reps she'll point out the tutorial part. This is better even if you do use the same workout again and again daily because, if you aren't doing the tutorial, you are reminded of proper form every time you do the workout, regardless of level. So I far prefer, regardless of who is working out, a workout that does not have a tutorial at the start and then other workouts, but one that has several workouts, all incorporating guidance as you DO the reps.

But kettlebells are an interesting workout in that you can more easily do the moves incorrectly and a good trainer can make all the difference. This is a good trainer who really knows how to do the moves right. You'll avoid injury but more importantly, you'll get a fantastic workout that targets ALL of your body. This one DVD can get you in shape all over, in an enjoyable way of doing it. So I actually like the DVD and instruction and found it a great way to get in shape.",1368057600,2,2901,4.528625954198473
5277936,4,B009904LQ6,"I totally wasn't prepared for this dvd. And at the same time, I'm glad I didn't get the 35 pounder for my first kettlebell!

A few months ago I bought a 25 pound kettlebell after hearing about how it works an ungodly amount of muscles in your body on The Joe Rogan Experience. Previously, I was mainly doing exercises with my 20 pound medicine ball, and while I loved what it was doing for me, I wanted to try something new. The kettlebell definitely changed things up. I looked up a few basic exercises, and after the first day of just doing 3 simple ones, my shoulders and forearms were shot for a week! When Ultimate Kettlebell Workouts for Beginners became available to me, I got it without hesitation. I can't say that this is really for ""beginners"", and it looks like a lot of other reviewers agree with me, but if you want a routine that's going to make you feel the burn, this is it.

The dvd is divided into three sections: Tutorial, Drills & Combinations and Core. The Tutorial alone will take you out if you're not fully prepared. I highly recommend spending 15-20 minutes stretching out your legs, shoulders and back before starting it! Paul Katami does spend a few minutes warming you up with some basic arm stretches and running in place, but it's nothing compared to spending a few minutes doing squats. Once you're set, Paul shows you a few ways to hold the kettlebell. By the handle normally, holding it upside down and holding it by the body. Then it begins! Squats, lifting the kettlebell up to your chin, squats while holding it in one arm, moving the kettlebell around and behind your head...there's a lot you'll be going through in the tutorial. The drill last 15, 30 or 45 seconds, and you're given short breaks between each type. I won't lie- 10 minutes into the tutorial, I had to sit down for a minute. When I completed the tutorial for the first time, I genuinely felt great, though my body didn't feel so great for a few days after. It's good to know that some basic stuff gives me such a workout in under 30 minutes. Drills & Combinations and Core are more advanced routines, and I'd recommend going through the Tutorial several times before tackling either one of these, unless you have a lighter kettlebell. Lunges, halos, planks, there's TONS of stuff to go through with these, and if your body was sore after the first routine, it's in for a shocker.

Paul makes for a good instructor, and takes time pointing out how his background exercisers are doing things, like their posture, rather than just having them be there to look pretty (which, I admit, they do in spades). This is a fantastic dvd, though you should familiarize yourself with the kettlebell, and have one you're comfortable with, before trying it out. A good idea would be to have your main kettlebell you use, and then a lighter one in case things get too intense, and you can switch it out.",1367107200,3,2890,4.543186180422265
5277937,3,B009904LQ6,"I love kettlebells, and was excited to watch this video.  I thought it had good pacing and exercises, and learned a few new moves, so I think this might be good for someone with a light bell.  On the other hand, I think it would have been much better with some more form instruction and some discussion of what weight bell to use.

Description:  This has three segments: ""Tutorial"", ""Drills and Combinations"" and ""Core.""  Each segment has a few minutes of warm-up, a series of exercises, and a few minutes of cool-down.  Katami is pleasant enough, and he and his backup exercisers run a fast paced, cardio heavy kettlebell workout.

What Could Have Been Better:  Especially in a video that advertises itself as being for beginners, I would have liked to have seen (1) some discussion of what weight to use and (2) a LOT more discussion of form.  This doesn't necessarily mean slowing down the second two segments, but I would have liked to have seen a lot of discussion of form in the first segment - how to hold your body, what muscle groups are firing, where to breathe, etc.  It is easy to hurt yourself with kettlebells, and if this video is for people who aren't working out with a trainer, occasional comments on form during the exercises really isn't enough.

If you're thinking about using this video, my suggestion is to start with a light bell - 5 pounds or even less - and work your way up once your form is rock solid.  It's a good workout, and you'll learn some good moves, but be careful.",1367107200,,1502,4.501845018450185
5277958,5,B009904LQ6,"I love kettlebells and my favorite exercise is 50-100 kettlebell swings with the heaviest weight you can tolerate for the entire duration. If you want a little variety this DVD is chocked full of exercises and workouts. Like other people have stated, the standing exercises are great, but the floor exercises can be a bit intense. I noticed the same issue with my Jillian Micheals kettlebell workout, and I think the only answer is that we are out of shape.

Having a DVD with a variety of workouts is the next best thing to attending a class. You get the effect of group motivation without having to travel or deal with the group. This DVD is a great addition to anyone's workout collection and kettlebells are a fun way to really work that core.",1367107200,,747,4.574626865671642
5277959,5,B009904LQ6,"I have another Kettlebell DVD called KETTLENETICS and it's ""okay"" but it never really grabbed my attention.  It was more ""dancy"" than anything else and other than Jumba I'm just not that dancy a girl.  (Dancing with Kettlebells, the next talent show sensation!)

Where the other DVD was dancy, this one is lots of drills.  The drills are not complicated and, rather than having to do your best to keep up with the instructor, you just try and complete as many reps as you can in a given time.  Most drills are only 30-45 seconds long so you never feel like you have to trudge through endless repetitions to get through it.  This DVD also has some floor work done with kettlebells, so you get strength training, cardio (the drills really get your heart pumping) and core/ab training.  The lunges are very intense but don't worry if you need a little extra support (a sturdy chair helps tremendously with balance).  The DVD is broken down into 3 routines (even the ""intro"" is challenging and fun), each of which is about 25 minutes long.  You can do one, or you can do them all, it just depends on how much time you have.  Just make sure you do them on nonconsecutive days, your body needs a break to build muscle.",1367107200,,1212,4.493150684931507
5277960,4,B009904LQ6,"Finally a video where the tutorial has you working out.  I think there is a drawback in that you aren't told what weight to use.  So I hope you pick up the smaller one if you are a beginner.  I really liked this video, I liked that it didn't have a useless section of showing you how to do something.  I thought there was a nice variety on the DVD, the workouts were easy to follow.  I don't know if the world 'Ultimate' was to mean level of work out, or that it was really thorough.  If you are new to Kettlebells this is a good workout.  I just wished you were given a little info whether it was an insert, or a very brief discussion of what weight you should use.",1366848000,,666,4.0
5277961,4,B009904LQ6,"Although this claims to be a beginner's workout, I would not recommend this to a true beginner for a couple of reasons.  First, if form is not mastered, it is pretty easy to hurt yourself with kettle bells. There are a lot of things to keep in mind with form and it is best to get some real instruction.  Second, there is not of enough instruction on the intro workout to master form on your own.  This workout is better suited to someone who has some basic kb training but could use a refresher regarding moves and techniques.  Now, if you fit that description, this is really a pretty decent workout DVD.  There are three workouts, each about 25 minutes long.  The first is an intro workout that goes over the basic moves.  The second is a drills workout that targets the whole body with cardio drills.  Cardio and strength training are combined with this section.  The third workout is a core toning workout.

The instructor is enthusiastic without being annoying. The production and direction is well done although a few more different camera angles would have been helpful.  The instructor does a good job on reminding viewers about proper form.  Overall, a pretty good workout DVD.",1366675200,,1187,4.681159420289855
5277962,4,B009904LQ6,"I am new to kettle bells.  So, I liked the attention to form that the instructor Paul Katami insists on.  These workouts seem deceptively easy but the next day I feel as if I've been beaten.  I say if you are new to kettlebells, get this so you can work on your form first.  My youngest daughter, whose 13, feels the instructor is annoying.  I don't find ths to be so in my case..",1366675200,,380,4.081081081081081
5277963,4,B009904LQ6,"I am not big on kettlebell work or male instructors.  My rather extensive DVD workouts collection includes little of either.  But I truly like this workouts.  I must state I find this far more intermediate than beginner in intensity, but as he says, ""its all up to you and the weight of the bell."" So,of course use your own discretion about bell weight and pauses.

Let me say that I think the term beginner here reflects the idea of being a beginner with Kbells, not to exercise in general.  I may rarely do Kbell work, but I'm certainly no stranger to squats and lunges.  However, when I did the first lunge combo following a long series of squats, I felt my legs in ways I think I never have felt them before!  My thighs are now jelly, and I'm not sure I want to feel them in the morning.  It is however beginner in that the instruction is clear and open and the moves uncomplex, combos are simple and includes an instructional segment.

There are no modifiers, for either beginner or advanced.  They just each use different weights.

The three workouts are: ""Tutorial"" (28 min.), ""Drills & Combinations"" (26 min), and ""Core"" (25 min).  There is a play all option.

Paul works out with two background exercisers, both female.  He FREQUENTLY stops to walk over to them to discuss form.  I appreciate the pointers but wish the camera wasn't on him when he stopped--it breaks my rhythm.

Had a nice cardio affect without impact--huge plus since I worry about disturbing neighbors.

Bothered my knee near the end.

Overall, I would consider giving this five stars if there were modifiers.  And I do think beginner is something of a misnomer.  My new-to-exercise friends would struggle.

As always, please consult your physician before beginning this or any exercise regimen.",1366502400,,1773,4.710097719869707
5277964,5,B009904LQ6,"Most of my workout DVDs are aerobic in nature and I've wanted to add more weights to my at-home options.  I ordered the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hers-30-Satin-Kettle-Weight-Kit/dp/B0041GMVQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hers 30 Satin Kettle Weight Kit</a>&nbsp;and a couple of kettle bell DVDs, this being one of them.

First, let me say I use kettle bells in a boot camp style class I have taken at the gym for over 2 yrs, so I have learned proper form, safety, and how well they work.  Paul Katami does an excellent job presenting all of these factors, which is why I think this has ""Beginners"" in the title.

However, the quality of the workout is not just for beginners - I have had several excellent workouts thanks to this program!  Even the segment that is supposed to be an introduction turned out to be worth repeating as a  great warm up to get me going in the morning or before doing the other segments.

I appreciate the segmented structure of this program, which allows me to customize it to my day.  For instance, last week my legs were sooo sore from my regular gym class, so the next day I turned on Mr. Katami and did the abs segment only, followed by a brisk walk outdoors, which gave my legs a break from squats and such.  And the next day, my abs were burning!

I also like how the exercises are done in timed increments instead of counted.  This meant that I didn't have to stay exactly on timing with the people on the screen if I felt off balance or whatever.

Paul Katami is pleasant, upbeat, and encouraging.  He has a great voice, and a strong, but not overbearing, presence.  His assistants look like women I might know, real women, not young models.

All of this fit together into a workout DVD that I'll be revisiting often and would definitely recommend whether you're new to kettle bells or already appreciate them and want more.",1366329600,3,1908,4.792048929663609
5277965,3,B009904LQ6,"My husband bought me a kettle bell a few years ago because I said I wanted one.  Once I had it, I didn't really know what to do with it. I kind of forgot about it & continued with my regular free weights weight lifting routine.  When I had the opportunity to try out this DVD I was thrilled!  I already have the kettle bell so I'm good to go right?  NO.  If you are truly a beginner like myself you might not know about wrist guards.  Please make sure you have them before you begin.  They are like sweatbands except they have a little plate inside them to protect the top of your wrists.  They are a necessity.  Fingerless workout gloves are another wise idea.  Your hands will start to sweat & stick to the kettle bell. It causes blisters not to mention it is hard to have proper form while your hands are sweaty.  After the workout I also decided to get a kettle bell that was 5lbs less than what my husband purchased for me.

So what all this means is my first workout was a bit sloppy but not horrible.  I did the entire DVD from start to finish using my 15lb kettle bell.  The only real issue I had was I simply could not do any of the exercises that required me to have the bell rest on the back of my wrist.  It took several days to recover from that.  Now before anyone comments that I am not supposed to let the bell fall/slam/wack onto my wrist, I assure you I would never dream of doing such a thing.  The simple fact is the weight of the bell alone was enough to cause injury.  Mind you I am a very small boned female.  I do not have excess weight on me & have boney hands & wrists making wrist guards a must!  Anyway I didn't really feel like I was getting a great muscular workout - more of a cardio workout.  So I wasn't sure what to think that first time around.  When I was done, I went ahead & ordered wrist guards & gloves deciding I would not attempt the workout again until I had them.

The next day I was SO SORE!  I was stunned!  So the workout does work!  When I had my appropriate gear & a kettle bell that weighed 5lbs less (10lbs), I worked out again with much less wrist pain. Unfortunately I developed debilitating hip/knee pain that lasted 2 weeks.  I could hardly walk or even lift my leg.  I walked like a 90 year old.  It was embarrassing & incredibly painful.  When I finally recovered I worked out again to this DVD.  Once again I suffered the same sever hip/knee pain.  I have not used the DVD again.

I don't know if my hip/knee problems were from this workout or if it was just a coincidence.  What I can say is that seeing how this is supposed to be a DVD for beginners, it is really lacking.  It was not clear on many things.  For some strange reason they wouldn't even let you on as to what weight each person was using!  I would have loved to know what the smaller boned woman, vs. the larger boned woman vs. the man were using.  Paul Katami stresses the importance of form & I tell you I was truly trying to keep the right form, but what if I wasn't?

One of the things I loved about this workout was the lack of reps.  Instead it is done by time.  Say 1 minute of a particular move.  You don't count, just do the moves, as many as you can in 1 minute.  You don't have to push yourself, but you can if you want.  I feel that this aspect of the workout is what makes it more of a beginners workout.  I loved that I could work as hard as I felt comfortable.  Some moves were very easy for me while others were rather difficult.  So if I could only do the move 2 or 3 times, so what?  If I could do them 30 times, great!

Overall it's okay.  I would like to try a different beginners kettle bell workout as I have nothing to compare this to.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.  I'd really appreciate it!",1366243200,2,3761,4.061391541609822

5277967,3,B009904LQ6,"Katami does not suggest the kettlebell size to use nor the footwear for the workout. I am a beginning. I did like that the tutorial describes each exercise in more detail, but it was still a workout. It is fairly easy to follow the instructions but it was more strenuous than I was ready for. This is not for a novice like me. If you are in decent shape or have used kettlebells before, I recommend this.",1366156800,,404,4.259740259740259
5277982,4,B009904LQ6,"The husband and I purchased a kettlebell when we went through a work-out necessities shopping spree, but neither of us were 100% sure what to do with it.  Oh, we picked up some good exercises here and there and the kettlebell certainly was used, but there is something so nice about a decent and specific workout.  And that's a niche this dvd manages to fill.

To begin, while I do consider this to be ""beginner"" level, that does not mean this is a relaxing or particularly mild workout.  It's quite intense.  What I believe makes it ""beginner"" is the focus on moves--in fact, the first workout is devoted to how to move and use the kettlebell.  That does not change the fact the instructor is gung-ho and devoted to giving quite the intense and powerful workout.

But, gosh darn it, he does it so well!  This is an extremely specific and well-taught video that makes you feel you can get one day get it all down even if you feel overwhelmed by the exercises.  Everything is well-paced, the build-up is excellent, and I felt this was overall a great ""teaching"" dvd.

Now, the kettlebell exercises are not great in number, so if you are looking for more variety to the workout you may want to look elsewhere.  However, I found the repetition of the exercises helpful in getting down the ""beginner"" moves and found a more conservative exercise plan here may be more beneficial.",1365638400,,1375,4.594262295081967
5277983,3,B009904LQ6,"I purchased a ten pound Cap Barbell Kettlebell to use with this and I'm glad I didn't go any higher. We have lots of kettlebells in our gym but even the bravest of our gym guys won't show me how to use them. They have my picture with beware of flying projectiles written above it on one of the corkboards.

The introductory section of this caused me some pause. There is not a huge difference in the moves and it is really easy to do things incorrectly like having your knees go out beyond the foot mark. Then almost all of the moves required that you snap back your knees. In Pilates and in yoga, we have always used soft knees. Snapping your shoulders back too, seemed prime for injury.

The range of motion is extremely limited. Most of the moves include moving the kettlebell up and down with one hand or the other or both.

After awhile, it started getting a lot more fluid and enjoyable. I liked it much better when they kicked it up a few notches. I liked how there was a timer on the side so you knew how long you would be doing something.

Oh, and the wrist bands? You really need them.

And wear shoes. Seriously.",1365638400,2,1123,4.253521126760563
5277984,4,B009904LQ6,"I used kettlebells regularly to build muscle the last few years and then I was out of commission for a while and now I'm wanting to get back into it so I picked up this video.  I like it enough that I will include it in my regular mix.  The instructor had a good way about him, nothing that will distract me when working out. I don't like videos where there is too much instruction throughout the video because it's fine the first couple times but then when you have to hear it over and over while working out down the line it just becomes grating noise and I've stopped using many a video workout because of that.  This one I can use long-term because he didn't overdo it in that aspect. I didn't have a problem with the level of workouts because I can adapt them to fit my level of fitness and do what I can do and not do what I can't yet. But I think if one was truly a beginner at kettlebell, this video would be too challenging unless they are cool also with adapting it to fit their level. One observation that has nothing to do with the workout itself: I thought the cover design was weird in that it features somebody who wasn't on the video.  Why wouldn't they have the instructor on it or the two women who were on the video working out with him?",1365465600,,1256,4.135245901639344
5277985,4,B009904LQ6,"I thought this was a good workout for beginner to intermediate level exercisers.  There are 3 segments, a tutorial, a drills and combinations workout and a core section.  The drills section lasts about 26 minutes and includes a lot of combination exercises that work your upper and lower body simultaneously.  So your heart rate will definitely elevate!  This section can get pretty fast paced.  So if you are truly a beginner, you will need to use very light weights.  The ab section is about 25 minutes long, and works your abs in 3 different positions, standing, floor, and prone (plank position).  Some of these exercises are more intermediate than beginner, but it will give the exerciser something to work up to.  The instructor was very good, he cues well and is friendly and cheerful.  He gave modification tips and emphasized proper position and correct form.  He works out with 2 other exercisers on a bright outdoorsy looking set.  The music is generic, instrumental workout music.  It just helps to keep you on pace.  Overall, I thought this was a challenging workout.  I am new to kettlebells, but will be trying out more of the kettlebell workouts.  They make a nice change from the standard dumbbell routines.",1365465600,2,1224,4.87378640776699
5277986,4,B009904LQ6,I really enjoy using kettleballs in my workouts and am always looking for DVDs with different workouts. This is a basic kettleball workout and I love that it has three 25 minute workouts.  This DVD is now in my workout rotation!,1365292800,,228,4.560975609756097
5277987,4,B009904LQ6,"I read about kettlebell workouts in the newspaper sometime last year, and had bought a small one to try, but never really did anything with it, which is typical of me.  When I saw this workout DVD from Amazon Vine, I figured I would give it a try.  Although I think it's well done, it's definitely NOT for beginners, or for people who are middle-aged and out of shape!  If you are already fairly fit and want a new workout routine to shake things up, I would recommend it with a few caveats.  The main one is that it really throws you right into some fairly strenuous workouts without much instruction, but for those who attend the gym regularly this might not present a problem.  There are three workouts, each about 25 minutes in length: a beginning one that briefly explains how to hold the bell and then embarks on the workout, an intermediate one, and a ""core"" workout which involves a lot of floor exercise.  Instructor Paul Katami doesn't address the size of the kettlebell one should be working with - I'm assuming that beginners should start with a light one, but I don't know because he doesn't say.

I tried the first workout; it's too hard for me right now, but I'm going to keep trying and do what I can.  That's what I've done with exercise videos in the past - worked at my pace and gradually get to something approximating what the people on the DVD are doing.  Katami stresses this in the introduction and says that quality is more important than quantity.

What I would keep in mind with this video is that this workout and equipment requires practice; it's not something you're going to pick up right away, so give it time.  You also need sufficient space in your workout area, since you will be swinging the bell around.  (I can see a lot of potential for either hitting myself in the head with the bell or accidentally letting go of it and hitting my TV.)  There's a lot of squatting and lunging, so if you have bad knees or arthritis, it might not be the workout for you.  In the third workout, there are a lot of sit-up type exercises which people with a back problem may not be able to do.  As I said above, I think this workout set is more aimed at those who are already fit, young, or both.

On the plus side, this video is well-produced, the instructor is engaging, the setting is beautiful, and the music unobtrusive.  I like the variety and quick changes of exercise.  I'm willing to give it a shot, and I'll report back in a month or so with any progress or other comments.",1365206400,,2503,4.3926247288503255
5277988,3,B009904LQ6,I am a complete Kettlebell novice as well as out of shape.  I thought this would be a good place to start because it says it is for beginners.  I would disagree with that--thus the 3 stars.  It may be a very good workout--for intermediate folks--but saying it is for beginners is misleading.,1365206400,,291,4.452830188679245
5277989,2,B009904LQ6,"I got this DVD and a kettlebell at the local sports store, having never used a kettlebell to work out before, and figuring this DVD would be a good starting place....well, I was wrong.

Despite having a title like ""Kettlebell Workouts for Beginners"" there is very little that I would deem to be ""beginners"" level on this DVD.  The introduction workout is OK, but that's only one small portion of the workout, and has some examples of good form, but little instruction.  I have a tendency to think that because of the explosive motions that you use in this section that the risk for injury from doing some of the techniques with bad form is quite high, so I thought this was a pretty inadequate overview.

After that first introductory section, the DVD jumps into a workout that I found seriously challenging, and I am the kind of guy who can run a 10k and who owns about 25 other fitness videos.  The second and third workouts really pushed me far beyond what I would expect a ""beginners"" level workout should.  In addition to that, they basically expect you to have mastered the forms demonstrated in workout 1 before getting into parts two and three.

Obviously, I own multiple workout videos, so I know that this kind of format is not unique to this particular video.  The problem is that the learning curve is so steep, and the introduction so poor that I cannot help but be critical towards this misnamed product.",1365206400,8,1418,4.599206349206349
5277990,3,B009904LQ6,"The video was ok.  For beginning it had a good pace and was challenging enough.  My complaint is that the cost of getting a kettlebell!  It had nothing to do with the video, but those manufacturers sure want to make money.
I would suggest going with a lighter weight to begin with until you know the proper form and are no longer feeling challenged.  Always better to cautious than jump right into an injury.",1365120000,,408,4.472972972972973
5277991,4,B009904LQ6,"I'm always looking for new routines to add to my workouts and Kettlebells seem to be all the rage right now. I'm very curious and thought this DVD would get me up to speed.

The concept of Kettlebell training is sound and you get much more total body workout with Kettlebells than you would with just doing static weight lifting. Most Kettlebell routines include using the Kettlebell during lunges, body twists and many other combination moves. It can be an extremely challenging workout.

The instructor on this DVD is very pleasant, energetic and engaging. He has a good voice, speaks well and the audio of his voice, as well as the underlying music is excellent.

As a beginner, I needed guidance on what Kettlebell to purchase. There was nary a hint of guidance on this DVD. There was no suggestion as to what a good starting weight would be nor was there any advice on what type of Kettlebell to get. I see some Kettlebells are cast iron, some are vinyl coated, some have really smooth handles, others have not so smooth handles. In short, I have no idea what to buy or what weight to get. This beginner DVD should have provided some guidance and it didn't.

I rate the workouts and quality of video and sound 5 stars, I dock the rating for the omission of any guidance on what to buy or what weight to consider getting.",1365120000,,1325,4.508333333333334
5278012,4,B009904LQ6,"This DVD will give you an excellent beginner kettlebell workout, explaining the steps clearly as you go.  The tutorial portion is very helpful in knowing how to use the kettlebells properly, and each successive workout provides clear instructions.

The DVD includes 3 different workouts, each approximately 25 minutes long.  The DVD starts with a 28 minute kettlebell tutorial that walks you through the correct form for each of the basic kettlebell motions. The next workout is a 26 minute beginner workout which introduces you to a variety of kettlebell drills and combinations.  The final 25 minute segment is the Core workout, which strengthens your abdominal muscles with more cross-over and twisting motions than the previous workouts. Each workout begins with its own warm-up and closes with a cool-down stretch so you don't have to select them from the menu. You can select one of the 3 workouts, or choose to play all 79 minutes at once.

This DVD is recorded in an outdoor setting, in a garden with a wooden platform in it.  The setting is attractive and not distracting. Paul has two ladies demonstrating the movements with him.  The ladies wear leggings that come below the knee, as well as a tank top, providing more modest coverage than many exercise DVDs.  Another small detail that I like is the visual countdown in the corner.  If he asks for 30 curl/row combinations, the countdown is displayed on the right bottom corner of the screen to let you see exactly how many more you need to do.

My daughter prefers Jillian Michaels' Shred it With Weights DVD, but that is mainly because she is a big fan of Jillian's workouts and is used to her personality and style.  Paul Katami is a good instructor, clearly explaining everything that he wants you to do, but Jillian fans may prefer her DVD. I will say that *I* prefer that Paul actually keeps working out through most of the DVD, stopping only occasionally to point out details of form and technique, as opposed to Jillian who frequently stops.

Overall, this DVD is an excellent value and will provide you with 3 effective and challenging kettlebell workouts at home!",1365120000,,2135,4.835164835164835
5278013,4,B009904LQ6,I bought this because I was looking for a good entry level kettlebell workout for beginners.  I think his instruction is pretty good and overall I liked him.  However in my opinion he moves too quickly between moves not giving you a chance to catch your breath.  For now I'm sticking with Iron Core Kettlebell with Sarah Lurie.  I find it to be better for a beginner.  Once I'm more comfortable with the kettlebells then I'll go back to this workout.,1364860800,5,450,4.506172839506172
5278014,5,B009904LQ6,"Although Paul Katami and his assistants, Nichelle and Marlene, are presenting advanced workouts, I view them as appropriate for beginners. I know when I purchased the Zumba fitness workout tapes they were similar. As a beginner, no way would I be able to perform as well as the experienced Zumba dancers, yet I could ""participate"" in the workouts. This is similar. Yes, they are advanced, but doable. One thing Katami reiterates throughout the DVD is that ""speed is not the answer, precision is."" Each segment is done in thirty second segments, with a thorough tutorial. Perhaps not a total workout for beginners, but it is the ""ultimate"" way to see what the kettlebell workout is all about and how far you can go with it.

Kitami is very thorough instructor and each time a new move is being introduced he outlines what he is doing. Occasionally he stops to point out either Nichelle's or Marlene's body form. This way he can optimize how you work out and visualize your own moves. All of the instruction is seamless and very well done. Simply taking a look at their bodies, it's easy to see how well these workouts can improve one's body tone. All three participants, who have very different body types, are buff.

In the introduction to Kettlebell Workouts for Beginners we hear a lot of inspirational material, but it more toned down than the Zumba workout. It is a proven way to work out by ""burning calories while building strength and flexibility."" Katani needs only to show up in front of the camera to proved that one and we can easily see that the kettleball workouts are ""powerful, dynamic, and efficient."" He emphasizes proper form and for the first time, but not the last, expresses that the ""quality of movement is more important than the number of repetitions."" It is recommended that you add more weight and repetitions as you become stronger.

The only thing I didn't like was that during the instructional portion of the video, the instructor didn't correct some improper form on the model.

5278020,5,B009904LQ6,"Note: does not come with kettle balls.  Order separately.

While this is a beginner DVD, it's not for someone who has never worked out before. If you have have a sedentary lifestyle, ease into it as its quite a workout.

The DVD has three sections;
Tutorial 28 minutes
Drills and Combinations 26 minutes
Core 25 minutes
Or you can Play All 79 minutes

Each section has a warm up, so you will be properly ready regardless of the workout you choose.  In the tutorial the instructor explains safety, wrists support, and grips (plus what the positions are called).  As an instructor, he's easy to follow and soothing while being inspiring. I like working out with him.

Reps are not counted, there is a timer in the bottom right corner for each new exercise. I like being able to watch the timer and know I only have a few more seconds to go.  It's nice to not have to count reps.  One less thing to think about.

There is a lot more squats and lunges than I imagined I could do, and boy was I sore the first few times.  It takes some strength and coordination to get used to the bells moving around your head and towards some of your body parts. I feared I was going to hit myself!

The core section is my favorite part giving my stomach a serious beating.  Another plus in all the sections is the amount of balance it takes to so the workout, which made me feel like I was working the muscles on a deeper level.

There are not a lot of bells and whistles. The music is a loop track in the background. I didn't really pay attention to it since I was focusing on not throwing the ball on accident. (For fast awesome music do Zumba;).

All in all, it's a great DVD that I'm happy to add to my ever growing collection. I will definitely keep it in my rotation.",1360368000,3,1754,4.256797583081571
