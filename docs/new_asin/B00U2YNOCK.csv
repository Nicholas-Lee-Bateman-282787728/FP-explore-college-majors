7028581,5,B00U2YNOCK,I chuckled all the way through this movie. It's an over the top movie but that's why it's funny.,1433116800,,96,4.105263157894737
7028582,4,B00U2YNOCK,"This film was wacky, the kind of movie you watch when you're high. But I liked, it. Rick was an arrogant goofball so he carried the film well. The acting was strong in this film, I especially liked some of the secondary characters like the preacher and his wife because they seemed the most real. They all did a good job of making me wonder if this was a documentary or fiction, and knowing this crap really happened years ago makes it even funnier because people are really stupid. But the film isn't a stupid film, its actually quite smart. I guess the theme of the film is to stand up for what you believe in, even if you look like a fool doing it. Sometimes they did try too hard but other times I nearly peed my pants laughing. Ricks wife played a perfect redneck bimbo. The nerd guy and redneck boy were very funny, too. Some of the best scenes were the townsfolk and the sheriff and the mailman and everyones reactions to these weirdos. Also the hostages were funny, especially the part where she made dinner and Rick acted like a lunatic and the court scene was awesome. Rick grows on you even though, it starts out really crazy but gets better about 10 minutes into it, by then I couldn't stop watching.",1433030400,3,1212,4.367256637168142
7028583,5,B00U2YNOCK,"This film will keep you laughing. David Abed as ""Rick"" is a true comedian and shows an impressive range of emotions. You cannot help but have an affinity for him. The other ""characters"" are also hysterically funny. What is amazing is that the film is based on a true series of events and a man who acted as Rick. What is also amazing/disturbing is that there are many ""fringe"" groups in the USA who think like people depicted in the film. This just may be the next ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and I can see a demand for plastic action figures of Rick in his raccoon hat!",1433030400,2,562,4.3619047619047615
7028584,5,B00U2YNOCK,Loved this hilarious satire on a true historical event.  Rick's character is done so well that you find yourself rooting for him and admiring his passion and determination.,1433030400,2,172,5.142857142857143
7028585,4,B00U2YNOCK,Seriously sublimely ridiculous. This film is not going to win any cinematography awards but that is part of the charm. You feel like you are there with your video camera filming the absolute absurdity going on around you. Especially crazy to know that this guy really existed and all the events are based on a guy who tried to take a hostage and force the government to make him president of the new republic. If you enjoy mockumentaries you owe it to yourself to see this one. You will never look at the postman the same way again!,1432857600,3,532,4.438775510204081
7028586,5,B00U2YNOCK,I couldn't stop laughing. that guy that played Rick is such a geek!!!!!,1432684800,3,71,4.538461538461538
7028587,3,B00U2YNOCK,"Seemed like guys with a cheap video camera making a movie in their back yard, and by that standard it is one of the better ""back-yard"" films I've seen. Not great, but not unwatchable.",1432080000,2,183,4.411764705882353
7028588,1,B00U2YNOCK,"Couldn't get through this, it was boring and not funny and I couldn't tell if they were trying to be funny what the bases of the movie.  Save yourself 5 minutes or even 10 and just skip over this one.",1448928000,,200,4.0

7028590,4,B00U2YNOCK,This should be a required video for anyone considering joining the secession movement in Texas.,1446249600,2,95,5.4
7028591,5,B00U2YNOCK,I laughed a lot at these surprisingly familiar characters. It's a parody of modern America that comes close enough to the truth to make you think hard between the laughs. Intelligent comedy that doesn't need a big budget.,1445472000,,221,4.842105263157895
7028592,5,B00U2YNOCK,"For a horribly filmed B Movie, this is funny, entertaining and GREAT ACTING! I loved it!",1445126400,,88,4.5625
7028593,1,B00U2YNOCK,No thanks. Good idea but it was not put together with any professionalism.,1444176000,,74,4.769230769230769

7028595,1,B00U2YNOCK,This is probably the least elegant review of this movie.  But this movie is awful.  This movie is crap. This movie is some awful crap.,1439424000,,134,4.32
7028596,1,B00U2YNOCK,Just not my thing. Extremely low budget. Extremely.,1438992000,,51,5.5
7028597,1,B00U2YNOCK,If utterly stupid is the criterior for top.billing this is the top of the dung heap. u tubed would have been the better venue.,1438646400,,126,4.291666666666667
7028598,2,B00U2YNOCK,"Didn't keep my interest for long, it went from interesting to dumb in a matter of 10 minutes",1438214400,2,92,4.166666666666667
7028599,1,B00U2YNOCK,Had to stop watching it,1436400000,,23,3.8
7028600,1,B00U2YNOCK,"OK, are the other reviewers here work for the film company that put this out?  This is why I never trust these 10-20 total reviews movie ratings.  This movie is awful, stupid and not funny.  Best as I can guess the humor attempts to make fun of a conservative or libertarian nutjob that doesn't think TX is part of the U.S.  This is just not funny unless you enjoy a movie where some dummy goes around basically acting like a nutjob.  And it isn't a funny kind of nutjob, just kind of pathetic.  Don't waste your time on this one.",1434499200,9,530,4.25
7028601,5,B00U2YNOCK,"You just can't make up certain kinds of crazy.  Short, funny, entertaining movie",1434412800,,80,5.153846153846154
7028602,5,B00U2YNOCK,"It was a really funny movie.  Although the budget was low, the writing and acting were both great.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",1434240000,,127,4.7272727272727275
7028603,4,B00U2YNOCK,Charming right-wing wackiness.  Sure it's got actors you've never heard of.  Sure it's a 'B' movie at best.  But it's entertaining ... if you're a movie 'fan' ... and not a movie 'critic'.,1434240000,2,188,4.636363636363637
7028604,5,B00U2YNOCK,Very entertaining and well done. David was great as were the other characters!,1433635200,,78,5.076923076923077
7028605,5,B00U2YNOCK,"Really fun! The old Betacam look was jarring at first but before I knew it I was wrapped up in the wacky characters and the storyline, I just had to know what was going to happen. The pay off was worth it too! (It hit me later that the Beta look was so on purpose. Really lent an authenticity and probably wouldn't be the same film without it.). 5 stars because it just thrills me that someone would make a choice that bold in a time where conventional reasoning would say to make it look really slick (since you can these days with a low budget film). Kudos to the Director! Great acting too!",1433462400,,593,4.2105263157894735
7028606,5,B00U2YNOCK,"What a hoot! It feels like a documentary at first, especially with the old letterbox format and the interviews. Then it slips into a clever narrative. There's a lot of crazy but, surprisingly, a lot of heart.",1433289600,,208,4.648648648648648
7028607,5,B00U2YNOCK,"""I fought the law and the law won"". Rick fights so we don't have to. We have all wondered, would it be so bad if Texas seceded? After watching this movie, at least we know it would be entertaining.",1433116800,,197,4.076923076923077
8704335,4,B00U2YNOCK,"Between the effortless comic book studio blockbusters and celebrity casted Indies that saturate the film industry like a sandwich with too much vinigar from the unwanted o. and v. in yesterday's lunch, Rick is a refreshing reflection of awell constructed film, indicative of the promising careers for these young movie makers . The writers and director convincingly mold a low budget and skeleton crew into an interesting mockumentary of sorts that deserves a second watch to catch the subtleties of a great screenplay.
A poor rating only reflects the critics poor attention to the witty nuances of a thoughtful storyline, and their quick to judge tastelessness in anything original or deeper than the shallow pools of Thor or Transformers they wade in with the masses of spoon fed ""quality"".
Enjoy the film for what it aspires to be and not for the big budget formula from which it detours. We can only hope more filmmakers have the audacity to break from the bandwagon and create something... creative. I appluad the cast for their confidence and resulting craftsmanship each should be proud to call superbly original and their own..",1517875200,,1135,5.042553191489362
