If the rights-holders to ""Frank Film"" are reading this, would you please just release a DVD and sell it for a reasonable price (like under $10)?

Until you do, don't be surprised if not too many people want to part with $50 for a 9-minute short.",1228435200,,368,4.318840579710145

I have seen this film perhaps 2 dozen times over the years since it was first released for sale and rental on 16mm film, and I love it.

It was made in the midst of the craze for collage films in the 70s and is one of the best of the experimental films of that period.  Highly imaginative and mesmerizing even 30 years after it was originally made; it stimulates lots of discussion if it is used in a class at almost any level--junior high, high school or college.  Even creative grade school students would enjoy it. It was well ahead of its time in the marriage of layered sound and multiple images to stimulate mental multi-tasking.

But here's the spoiler: The price is way too much for a 9 minute video. Art it may be, but it isn't pressed on a platinum disk.  C'mon guys, lower the price (used price is still too high), and I will consider buying it--surely the increased volume of sales would make up for a price cut.  Until then, good as it is, I will review it on my mental memory screen and not add it to my collection.

It is well worth watching. Teachers could use it handily in a number of courses all the way from art to psychology to English--perhaps they can get the school library to pay the freight on the pricetag, because most of the rest of us can't

7796053,5,1559742526,"I saw this film in my Rhetoric of Cinema class, and as soon as the initial collage of televisions hit my eyes, I was transfixed.  It was, to be honest, extremely bewildering until it hit me: this is how I think.  At that point it became sensory overload, but I loved it.  It was thought provoking, it was intense, it was absorbing.  It's required viewing.",1081728000,,355,4.415384615384616
