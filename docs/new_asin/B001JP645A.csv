8313321,4,B001JP645A,"so, anyone who is even considering watching any of these old 1960's ""sword and sandal"" epics has to know what you are in for. These 1 and 2 star ratings, I don't get. these movies never pretended to be anything more than they were, badly acted, badly funded silly fun. Please let me admit that I had such a crush on Dan Vadis, how can you not! So what this review is.....you get what you know you are getting and I love these Italian Hercules/gladiator Epics. Such silly fun.",1489449600,,475,4.348314606741573

8313323,1,B001JP645A,I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy done poorly or just very poor dialog and acting.  The props are horrible and the script rushed.  It almost looked like a filler show for Sunday morning tv back in the early 70s,1442448000,,225,4.090909090909091

8313328,4,B001JP645A,"This is one of my favorite gladiator movies. That's right. I like movies about gladiators. And I'm not ashamed to say it. This one stars Dan Vadis as Rocha,one of a troupe of 10 travelling gladiators. There are plenty of fight scenes in this flick,but for the most part they're played for laughs. Sort of like a muscular version of the 3 Stooges. None of the other gladiators except for Vadis really has a chance to stand out. Most of the action revolves around Rocha and two of the other gladiators. One is having a romance with the chief villian's daughter. And then there's a mute gladiator in the mix who's completely played for comic relief. British pro wrestling star Milton Reid aka the Mighty Chang plays a sadistic slave overseer here,and he an Vadis have a great one-on-one battle during the film's climax. The film's plot has Rocha and his team of gladiators teaming up with Spartacus as he begins his fight to free the slaves of Rome. Vadis is an athletically muscular hero,if not the greatest actor. Back on Muscle Beach he was known as Karate Dan,and it's easy to see why. Whenever he throughs a punch he drops into a horse stance and the blow resembles a reverse punch. This movie may not be to everyone's liking,but I find it enjoyable. It's a lot of fun. There are two other movies in the 10 Gladiator series and they're just as much fun.",1268956800,7,1355,4.53469387755102
