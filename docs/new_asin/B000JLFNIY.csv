8151594,1,B000JLFNIY,"Well-done documentary!  This guy went after eternal gold versus Olympic gold 4 sure.

My ""one-star"" rating has nothing to do with the outstanding content and editing.

My ""one-star"" rating is because this DVD has 3 parts that cannot be selected with my DVD player's remote, even though this remote has worked superbly with all other DVDs I've played.

For example:  I hit ""play"" and PART 1 (of 3) played then ended.  I hit ""play"" again and PART 1 returned.  I went back to the main menu to select PART 2 (of 3) and it couldn't be done.  I can only watch one of 3 parts.  I have the earlier VHS version of this that plays beautifully, so I guess I'll have to attempt recording it to DVD.",1462406400,,686,4.338582677165355
8151595,5,B000JLFNIY,"Tells a much wider story of Eric Liddel's life and why he lived and died. Much more complete than the movie, The Chariots of Fire.",1366675200,,130,4.24
8151596,5,B000JLFNIY,"I enjoyed this movie. The action was a bit slow so my 9yo boy lost interest, but my 12yo daughter stayed with it (with a few complaints). We watched the movie Chariots of Fire before it and, of course, Hollywood changed things rather drastically. While Chariots is still a good movie, it lost the real character of Liddell. I found him much more inspiring after watching this movie.
I think it would be great in a church library and highschool youth leaders should use it for a movie night.",1306886400,7,490,4.51685393258427
