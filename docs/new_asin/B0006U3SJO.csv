2195476,1,B0006U3SJO,"I love both Justice League series, but I refuse to buy any of these ridiculous 3-episode dvds.  It's a waste of money and space.  It just makes no sense to pay $11 or whatever for one disc when the full seasons of batman and superman are between $20 and $30 (i think) and have a lot more content.  So save your money and be patient for the WB to get a clue.",1108857600,11,357,3.9305555555555554
2195477,1,B0006U3SJO,"I just can't believe that Warner Bros. still are putting out 3 episodes at a time.  This is an incredible series but it's not getting the type of DVD justice it deserves.

2195479,1,B0006U3SJO,It's amazing how WB execs simply refuse to cash in on the season set phenomenon.  This disc is pure garbage in terms of content and an insult to fans who are willing to spend money on their product but simply aren't given anything worth buying.  Only 3 episodes?  I am boycotting WB until they give the public season sets or at least a better value for our hard earned disposable income.,1108512000,14,387,4.422535211267606
2195480,1,B0006U3SJO,"Justice league Unlimited is a great show no doubt,BUT to sell us a DVD with only three episodes? Now that's pretty low,especially considering all the good material that can fit unto a DVD! The whole first season could and should have been put unto that DVD! Not only did they only give us three episodes,but they had to put the three worst episodes! Guys give us a break! I waited two months for this DVD,but I didn't buy it when I saw what it came with!

2195481,1,B0006U3SJO,"I agree -- although there are no plans on Warner's books at all right now for any season sets of Justice League, this is starting to get a little old now. I suspect the Starcrossed DVD had good sales numbers because, if you missed it on Cartoon Network's surprise Memorial Day showing, the DVD was the only way to see it. But (as the other reviews point out) this is something else entirely.

2195484,2,B0006U3SJO,"Justice League Unlimited takes place after the events of the Justice League ""Starcrossed"" three parter. Hawkgirl is gone, a new watchtower has been built, Green Lantern has shaved his head and grown a goatee, and almost 60 new heroes from the DC Universe have been invited to join up. Format-wise, this new series presents shorter, half-hour adventures instead of the one-hour adventures of the previous series. This disc gives us three of them:

Initiation - the first episode. A nice setup for the new format, with lots of great action and characterization, but pretty bland in terms of actual plot.

Hawk and Dove - introduces two superhero brothers voiced, in a nice bit of casting, by the two brothers from the classic Wonder Years show. However the plot is a rehash of Initiation, and the episode shoves a moral down our throats that almost makes it an after school special.

Kid Stuff - the core members of the JLU are transformed into kids to defeat Mordred. I personally find this one hilarious, but it's definitely more out there compared to other JLU episodes, and I know a lot of hardcore fans found it absurd and pointless.

And thats it. Only 3 episodes of either average or debatable quality, and no good extras to boot. Worse, its possible this disc will be in cropped fullscreen to appeal to little kids who don't like the black bars. Even if it's not, I find this marketing strategy suspicious considering WB has been giving us great volume sets of Batman and Superman lately, and very good single-disc releases of Teen Titans and Static Shock with twice the amount of episodes. I'd personally hold off on this disc until we know what else is coming down the pipeline.",1108252800,118,1686,4.744027303754266

2195488,1,B0006U3SJO,After finding out the release style the WB has for the JLU series I felt I had to complain in as many places as possible.

2195492,5,B0006U3SJO,"Warner Bros. NEEDS to take some initiative and show the fans a little respect! We have all been EXTREMELY patient waiting and waiting for any Justice League season set, and the flimsy collection of the three dvd's in a box was a sorry charade of a big studio knowing what us fans really want. I mean, it took them how long until we got the Batman Animated Series? And even then it was all compressed into three volumes(which, personally, I didn't mind that much. I was just happy it was finally released)! Do they not realize the market for this show?

And another word to the ""wise"" - STOP releasing movies and then three months later releasing the ""unrated directors cut"" or whatever you think will make you more money! Yeah, you may get some of us in the confusion, but in the long run you're only shooting yourselves in the foot. You need to get some fan loyalty with your products. We'll buy the stuff if we want it, but you need to realize that we won't if you keep raising prices and re-releasing things right away. You can continue to complain about the bootlegging problem as much as you want, but unless you look to the source, i.e. YOU, it will most likely continue.

So again, 5 stars for the Justice League (Here's hoping for some JLI episodes next season!!) but none for you Warner Bros.!

(We'll see about a few for you when the AWESOME Batman Begins is released on DVD- but no promises)",1126137600,,1402,4.447470817120623
2195493,1,B0006U3SJO,WB - Either Step up with the option to buy the entire season at a time (Widescreen please) or don't bother.  This is a good show and deserves to be put out with the entire season as well as extras.

2195495,1,B0006U3SJO,"This is one of the worse cases of price-gouging I've seen in quite a while.

Personally, I LOVE the JLU tv show and I wouldn't think twice to pick up a box set (if they'd just release one).  However, to make fans of the show buy it (basically) episode-by-episode, is really ridiculous.

I'm sure there'll be a box set at some point, you'd do better to save your money until then.  If you need a fix in the meantime, these discs would make better rentals.",1121904000,16,454,4.305882352941176
2195496,1,B0006U3SJO,"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner.",1120521600,22,724,4.534351145038168
2195497,1,B0006U3SJO,"Honestly, I have no idea what WB is thinking! Putting a measly three episodes on one DVD is just a greedy and obnoxious way to irritate fans of the series.  ATTENTION WB executives either put out the entire series season by season onto DVD or just stop all together. This is just crummy, cheap, and annoying!",1120521600,17,308,4.5
2195498,4,B0006U3SJO,"When I was a kid, I could not wait to watch the Superfriends on Saturday morning.  There was Wonder Woman in her invisible plane, Aquaman patrolling the depths of the sea assisted by wonderful sea creatures, and the stolid Superman and Batman.  Of course, when I was a kid the world was a lot simpler.  Now, more than ever, we yearn for superheroes to take care of all the problems in the world.  JLU brings me back to when I enjoyed the Superfriends.  The writing is wholesome and old-fashioned, yet not corny.  There is a lot of political humor, and adults as well as kids will eat this up.

Now Cartoon Network and the WB have extended the popular Justice League series into a great Justice League Unlimited.  So many DC superheroes are here - old ones, like Green Arrow, and new ones like The Creeper.  This DVD - ""Saving the World"" contains episodes one, three, and five in the series.

Episode One: Initiation - Green Arrow, the amazingly buff Robin Hood admirer is invited to join the imposing League of superheroes with strange powers.  GA feels he doesn't belong in lofty space - he wants to stay and help ""the little guy."" But when a nuclear monster threatens a North Korean-like country, Arrow comes to help Captain Atom, Supergirl, and Green Lantern.  Supergirl is great in here.

Episode Three: Hawk and Dove - I am so happy to see Hawk and Dove here.  Brothers Hank and Don Hall help Wonder Woman in defeating the crafty Greek God of War, Ares, from feeding on rage and hate in a South American civil war.  I read a comic series where Dove was a woman . . . wow, that was a great series.  Would love to see it here!

Episode Five: Kid Stuff - The sorceress Morgan Le Fay gains a powerful magic amulet for her young son Mordred.  She wants him to use the power to become king, but Mordred has other ideas.  He banishes all adults, including JL members, to an alternate dimension, and takes over a theme park.  Morgan uses her magic to send back Wonderwoman, Batman, Superman, and Green Lantern - as eight year-olds!  Here we have celebrity Dakota Fanning doing a great job as the voice of Diana.  All the kids did a great job.  There was a lot of humor in this episode. I loved it.",1119657600,3,2194,4.41645885286783
2195499,1,B0006U3SJO,"...but once again we get no full seasons.  What goes through the WB marketing department's minds I'll have no idea.  As I did with the Batman, Batman Beyond and Superman series, I'll hold off until they put out something worth buying.",1118880000,15,234,4.682926829268292
2195500,2,B0006U3SJO,"Everyone reading this has seen Justice League Unlimited.  I think there is pretty much universal agreement that this is one of the best comic book based animated TV shows yet produced.  As each new episode is broadcast, the buzz in the comics community grows louder and louder.  I think the level of appreciation for this show is based on the high quality of writing and the exemplary skill of the voice actors and animators that bring the characters to life so well.  On every level creatively, this show excels.

The writers use and develop the DC Universe characters with great skill and subtlety.  Any changes or adaptations to the characters and stories improve on the originals and make sense in the animated universe.  I have yet to come up with any change that I felt was heresy of established comic book lore.  That's quite a feat for creators to pull off because there is a lot of lore and tradition to deal with.

As for the marketing of the DVD, I can't understand the WB's approach.  Three half-hour episodes?  Slightly more than an hour on one DVD?  What a waste.  The 13 episode first season of Justice League Unlimited would make a natural DVD set and preserve the complete story structure of the show and the developing mythos.  Everyone else has posted the same thing reviewing this item.  Sorry for beating a dead horse, but I'm very disappointed with this release and had to say so.

The WB has a very hot property here.  I feel confident that this show could easily crossover into the WB's primetime lineup instead of the odd irregular schedule of Cartoon Network or YTV.  Most prime time TV is mediocre at best.  Every week this show demonstrates the very best skills of story telling and character development.  Just think of the casting of the voice actors?  How could the selection of actors be improved?  How could the performances be improved?  How could the writing be better?  I don't know!  The creative people here are hitting homeruns with regularity.  Do we see that on regular TV shows?  Seen any good movies lately?  Everyone is scrambling for an idea looking for primetime magic - and yet this gem is just a kiddie cartoon as far as WB is concerned.

I'm old enough to remember when ""Jonny Quest"" and ""The Flintstones"" were original prime time TV shows.  It's time to try that again.  It's time to give this show a shot with adults.  It's written at an adult level, but shown on TV as kiddie cartoons.  Same with this DVD.  It's packaged as a ""Kids"" video.  The marketers just don't know the audience and the market for this stuff.  This show could easily be marketed to grab comics fans, SF fans, Trek fans, X-Files fans - just about everyone aching for something good to come on TV.  And it has got to be cheaper to produce this show than any regular show on TV's primetime schedule.  It's such a pity.  Did I mention this show was pretty damn good?",1117756800,12,2887,4.575342465753424
2195501,1,B0006U3SJO,"To say that these are not good episodes would be lie.  Truth is, it is all about having to buy lots of discs to get a complete season.  Stupid times a million.  Companies need to make them in smaller packages and these need to be complete seasons.  End of story.  I will copy these from TV and watch a tired old VHS WITH AN ENTIRE SEASON before I ever buy these.  People stand together on this!  Let WB know that this is rip-off!!",1116892800,8,430,4.108433734939759
2195502,2,B0006U3SJO,"Of course I preferred the complete season if it was available. It is not bad for a season start, but the publisher should have selected better episodes for this package.",1115596800,5,169,4.666666666666667
2195503,1,B0006U3SJO,"If I could give this set a 0 I would, as others have said only three episodes on the disk and none of the episodes are really worth seeing, in my opinion their three of the worst episodes in the entire run of the series (JL and JLU) so I guess the only good thing about it is that WB got the crap out of the way so it doesn't dirty up future disk.  Still three episodes on a disk with no extras is pretty poor when other similarly treated series (Batman Beyond) have had six episode disk, and even some of the JL DVD's had 4 episodes and decent extras.

If you want a JL fix, pick up the JL:Starcrossed DVD, its easily the best of JL availible on DVD at this time, sadly they decided to do half of season 1 and then skip all the rest of the first season the majority of season 2 (only Starcrossed in on DVD) and jump right into JLU and on top of that produce vastely inferior products.

I wouldn't mind episode disk like this, if they were in some sembence of order, and each disk had at least four episodes on it, heck I'd even settle for three episodes if they were at least entertaining episodes.

This disk is none of those things.",1115337600,5,1135,4.076233183856503
2195511,1,B0006U3SJO,"Not even a 'good' disc. I am appaled that WB is still releasing this three episode BS.

2195512,1,B0006U3SJO,"This is my favorite Animated series in a long time, but the '3 Random Episode' DVD format is appauling.  I would happily spend good money on seasonal box sets, and have on shows that I like less (Batman AS, GI Joe, Transformers).  Between Justice League and X men Evolution it is a shame that this can't be accomplished.  Obviously there's a reason for it, it just doesn't seem like it's a good one.

Oh well maybe we can look forward to a compilation in 5 or 6 years, but it's too bad.  I thought the entertainment industry liked money, and by snubbing adult collectors they're missing out on a fortune.",1113264000,11,604,4.454545454545454
2195513,1,B0006U3SJO,"Either wait for a DVD set or a better single DVD.  Saving the World conatins 3 early episodes from the new Justice League season.  It's a shame that they are mainly unenjoyable.  Justice League's strength was that it relied on episodes being 2 parts to get the entire story across, and when it was shortened to half hour stories the writers no doubt had to adjust to the less amount of time for a story to occur.  As a result, many of the early episodes were poorly written and missing the magic from before.  Nowadays the series seems to be back on track, but if the series is continued in 3-episode sets, not to mention that amount of time before Warner puts out a new volume, who knows when we'll see those episodes released.  Cutting to the chase the 3 episodes in particular weren't that great.  Initiation is my most hated episode in the series, with a rushed plot and characterization, and even a bit lacking in animation and the action sequences.  Hawk and Dove isn't that much better, and as a previous reviewer said winds up having a moral at the end.  The last episode, Kid's Stuff, is the only episode that's actually watchable, but even that can push the limits(although Batman does have a good line there).  What is beyond me is that the 2nd episode, an absolutely brilliant adaptation of Alan Moore's For the Man Who Has Everything from Superman Annual 11, wasn't included. Worst of all in this set is aside from the episodes this disk includes nothing.  The other Justice League DVDs aren't the best, but they at least included a few special features.  Saving the World can't even bother doing that.  All in all, unless you have a 4-year-old nephew/niece/son/daughter/cousin/brother/sister that REALLY wants this DVD bad, don't buy it.",1112572800,10,1751,4.701639344262295

ALL episodes are out of order, almost as if they were picked at random. With one of the Batman Beyond DVDs, they even had the nerve to include 3 entire episodes that were ALREADY RELEASED with the first Batman Beyond DVD. Then out of nowhere they release the boxsets for Batman and Superman, which are beautifully put together, as we would expect from any other boxset from another company.

WB's decisions with the Justice League DVD distribution enrages me as much as the Batman Beyond 3-episode re-release. Let's take a look at it from the beginning. Justice League DVD volume 1 is the first 2 episodes. DVD volumes 2-4 contain 4 disorder episodes each. Then a wonderful person over at WB decides ""Hey, let's SKIP THE WHOLE SERIES and release a DVD with the series finale. While we're at it let it be only a 2-episode DVD instead of the usual 4 episodes, so we can rip-off and enrage our customers even more. :) :)"", and that is DVD volume 5: Starcrossed The Movie. And now WB gives us DVD volume 6, the first 3 episodes of the new Justice League Unlimited series. Wonderful. We get to be tortured with a taste of the new series without getting a proper experience with the first one.

The Special Features are sparse and annoying.  Typical cut and paste schlock without any of the commentaries or interviews that have made the Justice League, Batman, and Superman disc sets so amusing.

Unlimited also lasted for two season, but the second season was much shorter in episodes. Notable about the series is that the production team led by Bruce Timm went to great lengths to add as many other DC comic stars into the series as possible, even if they only had brief cameos. Rather than focusing on the 7 founding members, they were joined by Green Arrow and many others, splitting into special groups for each crisis. Smart writing, character design, fluid animation, and outstanding voice talent made for a great series, my favorite of the two series.

This DVD represents 3 episodes from the Justive League Unlimited series, the DVD was released in 1995. Later the entire seasons were released to DVD on a more expensive multi DVD set. But at the time of release, this was all you could get, and another 3 episode set. If you are interested in sampling the series, or cannot yet afford the whole series, this may be the way to go for now. The DVD comes in a snapcase, not a full plastic case. No booklet or interesting insert is included. The three episodes are:
1) ""Initiation"" Green Arrow is drafted, and you know how he hates the draft, into the Justice League to help fight a giant robotic war machine in a communist country that does not even want the help of the League.
2) ""Hawk and Dove"": Evil Ares obtains a battle monster from Hades. He uses the machine to influence two countires to war against each other, and hopes to make the war spread to other countries. Wonder Woman, Hawk and Dove must put an end to it, but fighting the machine only makes it stronger.
3) ""Kids' Stuff"" In this very imaginative episode the adults on earth are sent into a limbo of sorts when Morgana gives her son Mordred an amulet of power, he even sends her away. Mordred sets up a world inhabited only by the children of the world, and controlled by him as self appointed ruler. Morgana agrees to send Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern transformed into kids to challenge Mordred and restore order.

Extra DVD features include:
""Save Gorilla City"" menu challenge
""Justice League Watchtower Database""
1) ""Superhero Intern"" 2) ""Keepin' Up With the Joneses""",1297728000,,2276,4.6875

I don't want to give the story away, but it's got a lot of Green Arrow who is one of my favorite heroes of all time! Supergirl is pretty cool and you'll love the action sequences.",1292889600,,256,4.14
