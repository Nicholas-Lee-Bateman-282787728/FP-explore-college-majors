8360073,4,B002ARALW8,"This is a good selection of Betty Boop cartoons, including samples of her early 'toons and the later ones made under the thumb of censorship.

One reviewer complained that the final 8 cartoons on the second disk were too dark and thus of lesser quality. I didn't find this to be the case on the set I have.

The earlier cartoons are a bit racy, but they are the best in my estimation. I was introduced to Betty Boop through watching the early ones with soundtracks by the great Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and other early jazz greats who were actually not major stars at the time. The later 'toons made after the censors came down on the Fleischer Bros. are fun too. They tend to be cuter with her little dog and Grampy, etc., so they are different but also fun. Until a truly definitive, complete collection is released, I recommend this one.",1289865600,2,846,4.487012987012987
8360074,5,B002ARALW8,"The cartoons in here fall into several distinct categories: (1) the Pre-Code ones of the early 1930s where she shows cleavage or wears nothing on top but a Hawaiian lei; (2) the ones which feature an almost-all music cartoon and  (3) the ones that feature a regular story. The latter were done in the mid-to-late `30s.

My personal favorites, overall, were the musical-oriented ones because they were all uptempo and made you feel good. The ones with Cab Calloway were the best.  Also, any story that featured the wild ""Grampy"" were hilarious.  He was a hoot, even more fun to watch than Betty.

No matter what category, Betty Boop cartoons were good stuff.  She was incredibly entertaining and certainly one-of-a-kind in the animated short movie business.  Betty never goes out of style.",1262304000,2,788,4.924242424242424

All the shorts on the first disc are very good dubs but there's darkness problems with the last 8 on the second DVD. Also, PLATINUM's intro plays before each cartoon and a faint watermark appears on screen at times.
