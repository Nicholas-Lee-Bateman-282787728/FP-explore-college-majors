3052039,5,B0010V60Y8,"This is the second Phonics 4 Babies DVD we have purchased.  ""Babies First Words"" was the first one. Colors and Counting is a much better teaching tool than the first one.  I love the repetition.  It truly engages my daughter and she is really learning her colors and numbers.  The pace is much better than other videos we have.  My daughter has some cognitive delays and this video has been very helpful.  I would love to see more videos of Mallory Lewis and the puppets...we would buy them.",1227916800,3,491,4.5227272727272725

8238673,5,B0010V60Y8,It is a very fun way to learn colors and counting. My older started watching it in a very young age (12 months) and love the songs. Even now (5 yrs) he likes to watch it for fun!,1379289600,,178,3.710526315789474

Try both in the series.",1374105600,,163,4.857142857142857
8238675,5,B0010V60Y8,"My baby is 20 months and loves this video.  I teach her a lot by one on one, but I've got to say that she has also learned a lot from this video about colors and counting.  I have the other video as well, and it is excellent too.",1328486400,,229,3.6530612244897958

very entertaining and lots of learning opportunities!
Lots of music; my daughter stays interested",1320883200,,148,5.208333333333333
8238677,5,B0010V60Y8,Love it!  All of my children love this DVD!  They sing along and I noticed they are speaking clearer and clearer - I recommend for new babies/infants along with toddlers....,1296432000,,173,4.733333333333333
8238678,3,B0010V60Y8,Not as engaging as I had hoped.  Needs more kids in the video rather than the bug characters.  I think toddler kids would take to it more if they included more kids in the video.  Better suited for kindergarten on up rather than toddlers.,1294012800,,238,4.363636363636363
8238679,5,B0010V60Y8,"We have both this video (Colors and Counting) and ""Babies First Words"".  The ""Colors and Counting"" is the better of the 2 but I wish Mallory made more.  This DVD teaches colors, counting, sounds that the letters make, emotions, being active and  cute songs.  It is one of my favorites and our son will aske for the ""Bug"" DVD all the time.  I highly recommend this one.",1247097600,,368,4.432835820895522
8238680,5,B0010V60Y8,"I am a Grandfather of 4 ranging from the ages of 6 month old,14 months old, 17 months old, and 5 years old and they all like  the Tummy Tots. They learn and sing to the songs, it amaze me how it draws their attention, this goes for both of the CD's. I use to watch Mallory Lewis mother on TV when I was a little boy 40 years age, so keep up the good work Mallory.",1241395200,,363,3.7142857142857144
