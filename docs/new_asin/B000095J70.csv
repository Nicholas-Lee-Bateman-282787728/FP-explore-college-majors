That is the quality of the acting, script, and production. My 3yo who normally loves any music video with dancing and a solid beat was completely uninterested. I saw the poor reviews and thought it would still be worth $0.01+shipping; I was wrong.",1401753600,,416,4.4868421052631575
8048810,1,B000095J70,This DVD must've been made in the 80s. My daughter hated it. I'd like my money back. Totally not worth any amount if money,1357084800,,122,4.125
8048811,1,B000095J70,"When I purchased this DVD, I should have known there was something wrong since it did not list the song titles or the duration of the video on the cover. (...) There are only 7 songs on this DVD: 1) All Star, 2) What A Girl Wants, 3) Kryptonite, 4) Get The Party Started, 5) Soak Up The Sun, 6) The Middle and 7) All You Wanted. What's almost as bad is that there is a hokey introduction, padding between each song and an ending which brings the length of the DVD to only around 30 minutes. A value added bonus is that the poor costume use and overacting will bring out a chuckle.
The action takes place on a city street while the kids are ""hanging out"" on the sidewalk. Of course, there always has to be an adult, this time merchants, trying to chase the kids away. While the store owners try to move the kids along, they say wise cracks back to them. We've all seen this so many times in the past and yet again with this video.
I placed the DVD in the player and showed it to my 4 children, all of which are under 10 years of age, after they finished opening their presents. My daughter's only comment was 'That's It?"" when the video ended some 30 minutes later. It, at no point, kept their attention for more than a few seconds at a time. We own all 4 of the Kidz Bop CD collections and this was to compliment them, since they are advertising it all over the place. The audio tracks are taken directly from the Kidz Bop CDs, so if you own them you will quickly realize this - just dancing and filler scenes were added to try and tie the songs together.
(...) It's just plain horrible and shows how a company uses their name recognition and past successes to fleece their loyal followers. It seems that the Kidz Bop group may have just ""Jumped the shark"".
Hints: Buy it on the cheap so you won't feel like you had been taken advantage of when you play it. Also, let your kids know its a short video so they will expect its quick demise.",1072396800,19,1938,4.1706666666666665
8048812,3,B000095J70,"My best friend gave this to me for my 16th birthday because of an inside joke, but we had the BEST time watching it.  No one is taking themself seriously, and it' so cheesy that I could watch it over and over again.  The kids are frightening, and the Elijah Wood bird looking girl who is dressed in purple lets her underwear show during the ""Soak Up the Sun Video""!  It's right at 22:09 if you want to look for it.  You'd think they would pay more attention to that sort of thing...
Anyway, if you're a parent, this is entertaining and I would suggest it if your kids like singing and dancing videos.  Just cover their eyes when beakface girl's undies pop out!",1064707200,6,660,4.290322580645161
8048813,2,B000095J70,"Then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else?  The songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals, which arguably weren't that bad (""What a girl wants"" and ""Get this party started"" were fairly tame to begin with).  Just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds.",1062115200,4,388,4.863636363636363
