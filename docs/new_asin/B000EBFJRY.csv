8108066,5,B000EBFJRY,This is a great independent movie with plenty of comedy and romance at a great price. It's very well worth watching!!!,1203724800,,118,4.666666666666667
8108067,4,B000EBFJRY,"I won this in a contest and got around to watching it this week.  Very different, very NY, verrry Buddhist.  It's not laugh-out-loud, but it's definately funny.  A different feel good movie than I normally watch, but definately worth it.",1154649600,,237,4.875
8108068,1,B000EBFJRY,"...than watch this movie again. Of the three of us who watched it, I was the only one who remained awake. Poor casting, mediocre story line, and just an all around lousy movie.",1153353600,,176,4.363636363636363
8108069,5,B000EBFJRY,"I loved this movie when I saw it at the Beverly Center last year.  I was smiling from ear-to-ear.  At first, I thought it was moving a little slow, but then things started to fall into place, and I was laughing pretty consistently.  I've never been to Fire Island or the Hamptons, but it reminded me of the family trips my family used to take down to the Jersey Shore when I was growing up.  Not many big names in the movie, but the performances are great--funny, sometimes silly, but very real.  Joseph Bologna deserves more great roles like Mickey Stern, and his teenage punk counterpart is played with perfect swagger and arrogance by Joshua Fishbien--his transformation is pretty amazing.  Tom Bosley plays a Czechoslavakian and somehow pulls it off with great skill--who woulda thunk it?  Renee Taylor is wacky beyond belief, and it's really nice to see Connie Stevens in movies again--she has aged so gracefully.  The young cast is uniformly impressive, especially the girl who plays Dina.  She is a find.  I can't wait to get the DVD--the movie is a gem.",1140825600,4,1061,4.717391304347826
