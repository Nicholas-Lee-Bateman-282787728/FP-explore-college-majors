8469002,5,B000CSR5UI,"I Thought this movie/ Documentary Was Great! Even Though It wasn't The Item I expected- A Sequel to 'Twister' With Helen Hunt, And Even Though I Was A Little Disappointed, I Still Loved The Movie!

It Is A Great Independent Documntary-type Show that you would most likely see on The Weather Channel. It Showed many scenes of different Tornadoes, and I thought some of the storms were amazing.

If you are willing to sit down for about an hour to watch a documentary, this is one suggested documentary.",1174348800,,501,4.681818181818182
