8346870,1,B001W0Z2VY,"This is a book - NOT a movie.
 I enjoy reading books, but not on screen.

After a long day, my husband and I were looking forward to a relaxing evening watching an old movie with Edward Arnold (his picture was on the cover).  What we found was a printed book and old music.
It wasn't even done well.

I had also bought the other two DVDs in this set , and I am going to send them back as soon as I can get them packed.  I am surprised, Amazon is very dependable as a rule.  This time someone dropped the ball - BIG TIME!!",1245974400,5,521,3.8679245283018866
