7957415,5,B000060MVI,"...just by looking at the 10 reviews written prior to this one... BIpolar reality, explained by demystifying the spinning and storytelling that has been strategically used by hidden interests, and media being a stellar platform for realizing them.

I strongly recommend this film to institutions, individuals and all others in pursuit of knowledge, ie truth.",1323302400,,358,5.509090909090909
7957416,4,B000060MVI,"I found this film quite interesting.  Yes, it is biased, but what documentary isn't?  For that matter, what history isn't?  One of the problems in this time of ""globalism"" is that we have access to all of this information from all over the world, but many people don't seem to care what others think as long as we get the economic benefits of ""globalism"" (which is not really a new concept - certainly the ""colonial period"" was a form of globalism.)

This film was made in 1991, and has an anti-Gulf War bias.  OK, now that you know that, you can safely view the film and realize the historical events that it includes will support those views.  While viewing it, you might be able to see the world through a view that you are not accustomed to, and this is not something any intelligent person should feel threatened by, whether one agrees or disagrees.  If the view can distinguish fact from opinion, then there should be no problem.

The events that are depicted in the film through footage and quotes are factual.  Contrary to one reviewer's comments, there are absolutely no anti-semitic comments in the film.  It is a discussion of the West's desire for Middle Eastern oil since World War I, how they've secured it, and the Arab response to this.  Nothing more.  Facts are presented in toe form of footage, quotes, and discussion.  Once the facts are given, several speakers voice their opinion.  You can take that or leave it - but

if we are going to be dependent on other nations in this ""global"" economy, we might do well to try to understand what motivates them.

Of course, this movie isn't complete.  I don't know what history book or documentary is.  However, it can be used to (1) increase your knowledge or review events related to the topic at hand; (2) hear the viewpoints of others and decide for yourself whether you agree or disagree.  If you don't even know their viewpoint, how will there ever be a compromise that could lead some sort of peace.

I recommend this film, in combination with whatever other Middle East study material you'd like to learn from.",1161475200,7,2080,4.615803814713897
7957417,1,B000060MVI,"The second part of the title is correct - this video continues the intrigue over the complex history of the Middle East. There is no historical anlysis, no coherent presentation of the events, it is bad documentary and pitiful journalism. This video is an extremely biased attempt to present the Arabs as passive victims of imperialist Western powers and the Jews and never mentions Arab violence against the Jewish population in Palestine before the World War II nor collaboration of the Grand Mufti Mohammad Amin al-Husayni with the Nazis during the WWII. The remainder of ""history"" after WWII is below criticism. A critical historical account of the last hundred years of this region is given in the excellent ""The Siege: The Saga of Israel and Zionism "" by Conor Cruise O'Brien.",1161302400,3,782,4.977099236641221
7957418,1,B000060MVI,"I am a high school history teacher and I ordered this video in hopes of showing it in class.  Oh well, easy come, easy go!  From the reviews, it seems like everyone either loves or hates this video because of its somewhat pro-Palestinian stance, but my objections concern the educational quality.  There are a few problems for classroom use:  1) There is no narration.  There isn't much of an attempt to clarify what's happening for those who don't know the history of the period.  2)  The video uses a good bit of real historical footage, but most of the time, there is no comment made about what's on screen.  For example, there's Arab street scenes shown from old newsreels, but you never know what point is being made at all!  They'll show World War II footage, but you don't know who's shooting at who or why.  3)  There's a lot of use of quotes printed onscreen (which is a good idea in general), but many times these quotes don't seem relevant or they don't identify the identity of the speaker. (They'll give you a quote with only a name, and you're not sure who this person is and what his position is).  4)  The whole production just seems amateurish compared to other videos.  You can tell from the first 30 seconds that this is going to confuse kids who aren't experts on this era.

This may be very interesting for those seeking to compare differing points of view in historiography, but if you're looking for a good introduction to the history of the Middle East, I would suggest that you keep looking.  (The History Channel and CNN have some videos on the subject, but both seem to focus on small time periods, so I have yet to find a good treatment of the entire 20th Century Middle East-----but I know this video is not it!  Maybe the PBS video--""Fifty Years of War?"")",1115424000,10,1785,4.4937888198757765
7957419,5,B000060MVI,"This documentary relies heavily on ideology from Chomsky with a smattering of history that leaps straight out of Dilip Hiro's books.  While this documentary is definitely biased in favor of the Palestinians and opposes the Israeli view, all of the arguments are well-documented and the material goes a long way to dispel much of the anti-Palestinian propaganda we have been fed in the West [especially] since 1972. If you have any interest in hearing an alternative point of view on the Middle East this is your documentary, and it also contains much on the real underlying factors [namely oil and commerce] in the marginalization of huge segments of the Middle East's population.",1101427200,16,680,5.071428571428571
7957420,1,B000060MVI,"Incredible! the rewritting of the real story in this film is incredibly crafty, a masterpiece of deceit, propaganda and corruption.",1100217600,6,131,5.6
7957421,2,B000060MVI,"I bought this DVD and was so let down to see that it pandered mostly to the way the Palestinians try to re-write Middle East history.  For instance, this DVD showed a shot of the British welcoming a boatload of Jewish settlers who were fleeing the Nazi holocaust.  It said nothing about all the boats full of Jewish refugees who the British actually did not allow to land in Israel -- who had to return to Europe. Tens of thousands these who were forcibly turned back by the British ended up killed by the Nazis.  Also, this film highlighted the tens of thousands of ""poor"" Palestinian refugees following one of Israel's wars with its arab ""neighbors"".  What it did not mention was that while little Israel was surrounded by huge arab armies, the ""Palestinians"" not only refused to help defend Israel, but most left their homes in Israel and fled to assist the arab armies - who later left these refugees on their own (as refugees).  I was sickened to see how this DVD tried its best to show the British as trying to be fair; when actually more often than not they worked against the Jews and tried their utmost to stop bringing about the return of the Jews to their ancient Jewish Homeland. I'm Christian, and not Jewish.  I just think Jewish History should be told correctly.",1053734400,15,1277,4.554585152838428
