5124634,5,B0083CV7IQ,"Went to the Roxy to see this after Mick LaSalle's rave in the Chronicle.  Really impressed by the story, acting, photography, music, and like Mick said, it is a total original and will stay with me for a long time.  If you like mysteries, buy it.  If you like moody films shot in real places that pull you into its world, buy it.  If you like intelligent independent films that aren't the typical family angst or depressing story line, then you will really want to see this.  I liked it quite a bit and will buy it.",1337904000,,515,4.268041237113402
8524446,1,B0083CV7IQ,"What were they thinking?!  It was a slow slow slow movie with no apparent thought to any of it.  I can't believe they actually wasted time making this movie, and I wasted my time watching it because I paid for it!!",1377561600,,214,4.195121951219512
8524447,1,B0083CV7IQ,"Horribly strange. Has the music, look, and feel of a bad 70's series - just bizarre. Sorry to give such a poor review, double sorry I lost an hour and a half of my life that I can never get back plodding through it.",1377561600,,215,3.909090909090909
8524448,3,B0083CV7IQ,"This film is just okay, probably more like a 2.5. I felt like watching something before I went to bed so I gave it a go. What it suffers from most is its basic premise, the idea that Hollywood is a place of dreams for those who live there and everyone would like to be part of the glamor. Okay...and??? Even with that, don't expect super deep insights. The girl, who says very little during the film, doesn't help and the dialog drags when she does talk. My title really says it all. It feels very much like an old Twilight Zone episode with an insightful but less than startling ending. It would have been better as a thirty minute short or a short story with lots of internal dialog.",1348272000,,685,4.276923076923077
8524449,5,B0083CV7IQ,"Check this one out. It's a funny, unique and surprising quest up and down Hollywood Blvd. I won't spoil any plot points but it has some fun twists. This is a must see for filmmakers who are tired of waiting for someone else to say yes to their project. When you see the quality of the performances, locations, camera work, costumes, everything top to bottom you can't help but find yourself inspired by what they achieved. Decide you won't be stopped and get it done, oh, and write a great script!",1340064000,,497,4.472527472527473
8524450,5,B0083CV7IQ,"A unique, almost unclassifiable mixture of ghost story and poetic mood piece, writer/director Steven Peros's FOOTPRINTS opens on a dazed young woman (Sybil Temtchine) who comes to her senses in the forecourt of the Chinese Theater, then follows her as she wanders up and down the boulevard trying to piece together who she is, how she got there and what her future might be. Besides the Chinese, the film touches on many familiar landmarks (to Angelenos, at least) of the real, geographical Hollywood: the Egyptian Theatre, Hollywood Book & Poster Company, the Scientology Center, tour guides and street performers. In that sense FOOTPRINTS is very much a movie about the actual Hollywood, a gaudy and more than slightly seedy neighborhood where people live and work. Peros shows a real knowledge and affection for the neighborhood: you can almost smell the exhaust coming off the boulevard and hear the sounds of people jostling and hawking up and down the street.

On a deeper level, though, FOOTPRINTS is about the Myth of Hollywood, the dreams and delusions that young hopefuls bring there. Dreams that sustain them through years of rejection and disappointment, and dreams that in the end can break them. In an extremely savvy bit of casting, Peros draws on two Hollywood survivors -- actor H.M. Wynant (a familiar face to fans of classic 1950's and 1960's TV from appearances in ""The Wild Wild West,"" ""Playhouse 90,"" ""Perry Mason"" and many others) and actress Pippa Scott (THE SEARCHERS, AUNTIE MAME, ""The Virginian"") -- to play key roles in the story. Wynant and Scott both lend a quiet grace and rueful charm to their parts, and when they talk about Hollywood you get the sense it comes from a lifetime of hard experience.

It's not too much of a stretch to compare the film to THE WIZARD OF OZ, with Temtchine's lost, amnesiac lead character standing in for Dorothy as she wakes up in a strange wonderland filled with sometimes helpful, sometimes sinister characters, and trying desperately to find her way ""home,"" wherever that may be. FOOTPRINTS is also a ghost story of sorts (although definitely not a horror film) -- and especially in an indie film world too often filled with overly literal, kitchen-sink dramas, it's really refreshing to see an independent film that's as poetic and haunting as this one is.",1339372800,,2323,4.938618925831202
8524451,5,B0083CV7IQ,"It's rare that I see a film at a festival that stays with me for more than a day. Most have a quick gimmick or retread well worn territory but really have nothing much else of substance to them and are forgotten usually by the next morning.

""FOOTPRINTS"" is a film that breaks this mold wide open. It's graceful, poetic and resonates like very few films ever do--be they in a festival or in a theater. It's very difficult to summarize or characterize the movie beyond saying that it touches you. It certainly touched me and has stayed with me since I saw it. I don't want to try to ""summarize"" what the film is about, it wouldn't do it justice. Suffice it to say, the performances are delicate and rich, the images beautifully realized and the story deeply compelling.  Definitely worth getting, you'll want to watch it multiple times.",1338336000,,835,4.56
8524452,5,B0083CV7IQ,"I saw FOOTPRINTS when it first premiered at the STARZ DENVER FILM FESTIVAL.  I really like this film.  It is beautifully acted by an amazing ensemble and is masterfully written and directed by Steven Peros, the writer of THE CAT'S MEOW.  It is a beautiful, funny, touching homage to the dreamers and doers of Hollywood that is sure to please anyone who is a fan of American movies.",1338336000,,381,4.573529411764706
8524453,5,B0083CV7IQ,"A touching and lovely nod to Hollywood and the dreamers who people the streets along Hollywood Boulevard.  Quirky, charming and compelling characters take us on a journey with a young woman who wakes up in front of Graumann's Chinese Theatre with no memory of who she is or how she got to the walk of fame.  What follows is a poignant story of the dreamers.  Beautiful performances.  Sybil Temtchine is a delight.",1338336000,,413,4.694444444444445
8524454,5,B0083CV7IQ,"Very happy to see Footprints is now available on Amazon.  I managed to catch an early screening at the Egyptian awhile ago and I was really touched by it. Writer-Director Steven Peros takes you on a magical, mystery tour up and down the famed boulevard that reaches into Hollywood's past and reaches out to Hollywood's future. Sybil Temtchine shines in the lead role, hitting all the right notes as you follow her journey. And John Brickner--as the flunky tour guide who tries to help out--shows why his is a name to remember. It's the kind of movie that seems to have a little something for everyone, just like the industry to which it pays homage. It's got wit, it's got charm, and it leaves you thinking. One of those movies you'll want to see again once you know how it ends.",1338336000,,779,4.524822695035461
8524455,5,B0083CV7IQ,"I really enjoyed the highly original film ""Footprints"" at the Egyptian Theater! It's very exciting to see a filmmaker step out and make a story that cannot be compared to any other. The gradual unveiling of all the mythological elements made for a very captivating story with the perfectly crafted pieces fitting together beautifully. At the end, the film's surprise makes sense. All of the characters were well drawn and well cast- the acting was very believable and fun. I look forward to the success of Footprints and other movies that Steven Peros will undoubtedly make in the future, hopefully again starring Sybil Temtchine, who definitely belongs in every frame!!",1338249600,,670,5.1
