3026479,4,B000YDBP34,"Despite being an anime fan, my tastes tend to be within a certain niche; a familiar type of storytelling that lets me get into the show a lot more easier. As such, a horror series like Hellsing or Hell Girl might not reach to me as quick as something like Fate/Stay Night, Chrono Crusade or the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Noein's more of a sci-fi drama with action peppered throughout as opposed to an all-out fight series like you'd be expecting. This is a series that's meant to get into your brain and make you think rather than just offer simple thrills and despite a couple of flaws, the show was still fascinating in the end.

Haruka Kaminogi is a normal girl in school while her friend Yu Gota has been feeling down lately since his mom has been making him study frequently to prepare for exams and even going as far as to bar him from going out with his friends. While the 2 are out late at night along with 3 other friends, mysterious strangers appear and they all seem to want Haruka. Turns out they're from the dimension La'Cryma which resembles Haruka's timeline in the future while one stranger, Karasu, might be Yu in the future. With talk of needing the ""Dragon Torque"" and the mention of another dimension known as Shangri-La, Haruka and Yu have to save their dimension as well as all others in existence.

While the plot might sound confusing and the concepts of quantum physics, multiple dimensions with infinite possibilities and time travel might make your head explode, don't fear since the series is actually rather easy to understand once you're in the thick of it. Unlike most shows (Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain anyone?) where you probably won't understand it even if you saw the entire series, Noein is just simply revealing its cards a bit at a time rather than obscuring them and making you wonder what it is you saw. It's even got some themes that are actually quite touching and make for good discussion points so the head messing isn't just for fun.

One thing I will say though is that this is a series where patience helps while watching. This isn't the kind of show where each episode will have a battle scene in order to keep you from changing the channel in boredom and not to mention several episodes actually deal with ideas of adolescence, planning for a future you have no idea what it would entail and the growing pains of expectations at a young age. When the fight scenes do kick in though, they are as cool and unique as they come and they become welcome to the show's pace though some might not like they're a little bit scattered and only showing up at a more sporadic place.

Instead of shows like from Gonzo or shonen titles like Naruto, the animation is in the realm of being unique if only because it's vaguely familiar of something you must've watched before but there's something different about it. Noein though is indeed a beautiful show with top transfer and while the use of CG is still noticeable as in other uses in anime, the 2D artwork works quite well and when things get a bit intense, the animation changes to a bit more artwork style with more thicker lines and kind of resembles the Kid's Story short from the Animatrix. The show also has a fantastic store with some pretty good opening and closing numbers but as usual the extras are rather pitiful. The usual textless openers and trailers (despite volumes being released over a period of time, it's still the same trailers included) and a little featurette spread out over the 5 discs. While I'm aware that anime features than to be sparse, it's also something to actually buy something with little added.

While I probably wouldn't have it on repeated viewing anytime soon, Noein didn't waste my time and actually kept me interested throughout so I say give it a shot; never know, might just like it.",1215734400,,3831,4.603221083455344
3026480,3,B000YDBP34,"I love the subject matter of this series - and in its exploration of the subject,  Noein really stepped outside the boundaries of many anime series.

The problem with taking on such a complex idea is that it becomes difficult to avoid plot holes and keep the series concise.  There were definitely moments where I thought ""oh, cool - this is a very interesting turn of events"" but there were also many moments where I thought aspects made no sense even in the structure of the world they set up. Some significant characters could have been developed more and others could have been left on the sidelines.

The English dub can sound a little over dramatic, but it's tolerable. The animation is different from many anime, somewhat odd, but fitting for the nature of the series.  The series is not bad, but you have to be willing to let some things slide - I can do that pretty easily with a cheesy romance comedy anime, but for some reason SciFi that wants to be taken seriously has a more strict set of rules to live up to.

If you're into SciFi Anime - ""Dennou Coil"" is a similar series to Noein that explores alternate dimensions through the eyes of children, but Dennou Coil has a pretty solid grasp on the world it created and very few (if any) plot holes.",1212451200,6,1259,4.452173913043478
3026481,4,B000YDBP34,Noein is a very interesting outlook on past present and future the animation is great the story is great. You do get kinda lost at points but everything clears up in the end. Its a good buy and totally worth it.,1212019200,,211,4.170731707317073
3026482,4,B000YDBP34,"I rented this series on Netflix and ended up liking it so much I'm actually buying the DVDs. Although, it does help that it's so well-priced--what a bargain! Anyway, I didn't have very high expectations when I first started watching the series; it seemed like just another ""girl with special powers"" anime. I was just hoping for a sci-fi action hit w/this one. But I started really getting into the story and the characters, which turned out to be quite rich and complex. I loved the whole quantum physics stuff in the story; the multiverse, infinite futures, etc etc--very interesting. But at the heart of it all is the touching relationship among the young friends and especially the special bond between the protagonists Haruka and Yu. Even though the main characters in this series are elementary school kids, they're not cutesy or contrived; they're depicted in an appealing, natural way. It delivers on the action front as well, with some breathtakingly fluid fight scenes, using an effective blend of 2D and 3D animation, which is enhanced by an unexpected ""sketchy"" style of art for some of the characters, especially the stoic and mysterious Karasu. He's a soldier from the future who seems unusually determined to protect Haruka. I usually watch my anime with subtitles, and I found the Japanese voice for Karasu to be very appealing--really sexy :)",1211414400,,1359,4.964912280701754
3026483,5,B000YDBP34,Noein is an awesome anime show that i discovered a while ago. This anime is so great that i'm gonna watch the whole series again but in english. I think that watching any anime in japanese with english subtitles are best. I would have to say that this anime is for people who are just happy to have discovered new anime's like noein. I recommend watching it on [...] first before you buy just in case you buy the whole series and you don't like the anime on the first episode. It's mainly a waste of your time. so if you like sci-fi fantasy anime type things i recommend this greatly.,1210723200,,584,4.27027027027027
3026484,5,B000YDBP34,"If you are interested in, or believe in, quantum physics, this is the anime for you.  It will undoubtably leave you thinking about all the possibilities of the unknown.  I loved it, and have watched it several times already.",1210291200,,224,4.717948717948718
3026485,5,B000YDBP34,"Plot: 8.5/10

Rich in detail and very complex. The idea of different universes existing for every choice, with the you in that universe going down a different path, is truly fascinating.

I have to mark it down a little because of the slow pacing and unexplained elements of the story. However, I'm sure someone who has a better understanding of quantum physics would add 0.5 to this rating.

Characters: 9.7/10

Watching the main characters develop in Noein is different than in any other anime I've watched. You see how they *possibly* look and act in the future throughout the show (sometimes even more than one possible future version), which creates thoughts and shows the characters from different angles.

My favourite characters were not the main two (Haruka and Yuu), my favourites instead being Ai and Isami. It's both funny and cute seeing them try to hide their feelings for each other as the series progresses, Ai being a fiery red/orange-head and Isami being your average male - Unable to pick-up on signals. Isami's character is probably my favourite due to the future versions of him shown.

The only real bad character point I can think of is Yuu's character - He gets quite annoying with his attitude. The annoyance is worsened by slow plot progression.

Art / Animation: 9.5/10

I can't rate art and animation accurately since I know nothing about it.

Noein looked amazing and fairly unique to me from the moment I first saw it. The start of the show showed that it obviously had quite a big budget, combining CG with excellent art and animation. The show kept up the high quality visuals until the end, although the less important episodes didn't get the attention the more important ones did.

Sound: 9/10

I'm probably being quite harsh here - The soundtrack is outstanding. The the choral battle/action music really gets you excited, the dramatic music does its job, the cute/funny music is fun to listen to... It's all great. My only reason for not rating higher is because there aren't too many tracks I'd want to listen to when not watching the series.

Total: 9.2/10

All in all, an amazing series. This is a series every anime fan should watch.",1202428800,12,2173,4.793565683646112
3026486,4,B000YDBP34,"This box set takes the five individually released DVDs and puts them into one package.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains only four.

The first disc was the best when it came to bonus features.  The second and third disc had decent features.  The fourth and fifth discs, however, were a disappointment.  It felt like they put too many special features on the first disc, and then ran out of features and were forced to repeat a feature from the first disc.

The series itself is very well done, and I would recommend this box set.  For fans of Noein, this is definitely the way to go get the full series.  Instead of having to pay $90-$100 to pick up all five DVDs individually, you can purchase this box set for about $40.",1202256000,12,763,4.438848920863309
3026487,4,B000YDBP34,"Clearly, the animation industry in Asia has a pulse on North American audiences.  Noein is another winner from Manga.com that comibines futuristic fantasy, with adolescent angst.

The La'Cryma and Shangri-La are battling for supremacy, and the Dragon's Torque stands between them.  A young 12 year old girl, Hakura, possesses the Torque unknowingly.  The complete 24 episode battle takes you up, down, left, right, and through a mangatastic experience like no other.

Highly recommended.

3026488,5,B000YDBP34,"Dimensional apocalypses, quantum physics, and preteen coming-of-age. Not a lot of series could manage all that.

But in fact, the tightly-woven story of ""Noein"" succeeds in everything it attempts -- an eerie, other-dimensiony storyline  with some complex characters and well-placed comedy. The animation is a bit simple, but the story it's wrapped around is complex and well-developed.

As the story opens, Dragon Knights are fighting a Shangri-la ship over a barren landscape. The ship explodes, taking Karasu with it. In Japan, a young girl named Haruka spots him standing on a church spire.

Months later, Haruka goes on a ghost hunt with her pals Ai, Miho, Isami and the troubled Yuu. Then Karasu appears, and identifies Haruka as the Dragon Torque. As he battles another Dragon Knight, the deranged Atori, Haruka finds that she can unintentionally manipulate time and space. And Karasu seems eerily familiar -- turns out he's Yuu from the future.

Soon the town is swarming with Dragon Knights, all trying to capture Haruka -- except for Karasu, who vows to protect her with his life. And when the Knights kidnap Haruka back to their dimension, La'cryma, she finds that their world is OUR future -- a ruined planet being slowly destroyed by the dimension Shangri-la. And her captors are future versions of her friends, Isami and Ai.

Things don't improve much after Karasu manages to whisk her back to Earth, and hides in her spare room. Haruka and her friends have to deal with more Dragon Knights, a quantum physicist, and a mysterious masked figure -- Noein --  wants Haruka for himself. And Karasu has to deal with Fukurou, a future version of Isami -- to keep Haruka safe, he'll have to fight his oldest friend to the death.

To protect her world -- and her beloved Karasu/Yuu -- Haruka will do anything. But she hasn't reckoned with the devious Noein, and the horrifying secret that drives him to unite all the dimensions...

""Noein"" is a pretty densely plotted show -- coming-of-ages, apocalyptic battles, personal struggles, and action-packed sci-fi. And the all-too-human characters are explored in detail. All of this is expertly woven together, along with some plot twists that only stop when the story is complete.

Fortunately, it has more than just clever writing -- it's full of exquisitely beautiful visuals (Karasu's healing, Noein's fortress), bittersweet memories, and sweetly humorous scenes (Atori regressing into a childlike state). In a way, the sweeter scenes make the struggle against Shangri-la even more harrowing.

And it's loaded down with action -- lots of high-voltage fight scenes, including kinetic air battles, falling lift cars, exploding buildings, bug-eyed guru-ships invading our world, and some holes in the universe. And though the dialogue isn't exactly littered with quotables, it has some great lines (""Even if we are being killed, we can still pretend it's not happening!"").

Most of the characters are given little moments to shine, but the main trio takes center stage. Haruka and Yuu make great protagonists: one is upbeat and kindly, and the other is miserable because of his mother's obsessions. And Karasu is an absolutely stunning anti-hero, whose dark personality is even more striking when you realize that he's a future Yuu who has lost everything he loved.

And the supporting characters are almost as great -- the athletic Ai, flaky Miho, and wannabe tough-guy Isami. These three are totally lovable, and it's painful to see their lives disintegrate in one potential future. And attention is also given to the psycho-turned-amnesiac Atori, the quiet Tobi, as well as Yuu's unhappy mother.

As for the dub, almost all the actors are excellent, and Crispin Freeman is nothing short of phenomenal as the tortured Karasu -- rough, raw, anguished, and sometimes a wee bit tender. The only weak spots, really, are a hammy Bryce Papenbrook and Cindy Robinson with a Southern accent so strong you could smash cinder blocks with it.

Noein has a few animated weak spots, but the storyline is a peerless blend of complex sci-fi, quantum physics, and love. A stunning, harrowing story.",1195257600,54,4135,5.096153846153846

Noein: To Your Self is one unique science fiction anime series watch. The character designs are rather funny-looking because they can appear almost comics-like but much more bright and colorful. The anime series is driven by alternate realities. Haruka Kaminogi the lead character is a girl that has died in many of her realities and in a present reality that diverges in the endless flow of parallel dimensions , Yuu Got
 , a friend of has decided he won't be like the other him's and letting her die. He'll try evrything, so she survives and lives.

The animation of Noein: To Your Other Self was such a surprise from the beginning. It's a styles that greatly differs from many animes out there and would be a big plus for any anime fan. Then the story itself is a strong one and actually with Noein: To Your Other Self was first introduced to the conept of parallel: alternate realities in this anime.

  See: Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku (a Book)

Noein: To Your Other Self has a lot of twists and turns in reference to its story. A lot of what appears one way omes out not being what it is. This anime is very serious and full of the feel of urgency. Even so like in most animes it does contain small moments of humor. Really a recommended watch overall. For those anime fans who like Science Fiction.

Overall: Amazing Watch!

However I'd like to point out that the subtitles are a bit too big (though I did get used to it) and they are not at the VERY bottom where they should be.
Also some of the subtitles tend to stick around for some reason, I think it's a glitch but it was very annoying. The same line would remain on the screen and the subtitles would just keep stacking up on each other......if that makes sense. However you can avoid this if you just skip ahead.

Sometimes it's a little heavy, but it's great and brilliantly written. There may be a few plot holes, but it's kinda hard to pinpoint because of the story's complexity. This anime also has a lot of good drama in it. The drama keeps you interested and gives you a reprieve from the heavy and complex story.

This show is similar to Serial Experiment LAIN in a lot of respects, though it differs greatly in most.  What is similar is the use of parallel worlds in an artistic, hand drawn anime with TONS of plot.  Though LAIN was mostly a cerebral show, NOEIN has a little more action mixed in.  Basically if you liked LAIN, Full Metal Alchemist, Blue Seed, X, or Mai Hime then you will probably like this series.

Be forewarned:  This is hand drawn and presented without computer cropping and trimming so it has an almost manga-like appearance to the animation.  I found it refreshing.

English dubbing is good, but the Japanese voice cast is far superior and fits the theme, story, and characters better.

3026524,3,B000YDBP34,"Well I better clear the air right from the get-go; this review isn't going to be very positive.  And don't for a minute think that it's due to the property's lack of potential.  In fact on paper, this series comes off like a science fiction fan's dream come true: Quantum physics, multidimensional travel, and converging timelines... There's just so much to get excited about.  Unfortunately, it becomes apparent fairly early on that the purity of such concepts is lost in translation toward a muddled mess of psychological-driven drama.  But before we get into all of that, let's take a moment to discuss the cold hard facts.

Noein the Complete Series consists of 5 volumes (24 episodes) spread across 5 discs.  Each DVD comes packaged in a standard sized clamshell case within a cardboard outer slipcase.  Total runtime comes in at 635 minutes and the program wears no rating.  Were it to, I surmise it would likely be around the TV 14 mark, with animated violence, drama, and a little bit of blood.  In all there is no nudity, foul language, sexual situations, or gore.

As is the case with most sub & dub anime, language options consist of both the original Japanese dialog track (Dolby Stereo 2.0) and an English dub (Dolby Surround 5.1) and the option of turning on English subtitles under either if desired.

Extras, which are stretched out across the full five discs include: enhanced 16x9 widescreen presentation, an ""on location"" multi part featurette with the director and a voice actor (Japanese with English subtitles), an image gallery, alternate openings, Japanese promos, and a bunch of Manga anime previews.

The story, which seems straightforward enough when broken down, goes like this: Twelve-year-old Haruka and her clinically depressed buddy Yuu are starting summer vacation with plans to run away from home together.  Yuu seeks refuge from his mother's tyranny when it comes to the area of his studies and Haruka wishes to see her father in Tokyo.  Before any such plans are solidified, they and their schoolmates encounter an odd white-haired man who seems a bit low on patience named Karasu.  Here's the kicker, Karasu claims to be Yuu fifteen years in the future.

At face value, that in and of itself makes the show sound irresistible.  Further investigation only strengthens viewer curiosity.  It turns out that a violent battle is taking place in space-time all around us, particularly between the dimension La'cryma and the dimension Shangri-La.  Subscribers to the multiverse theory of existence will doubtlessly already get the gist of the idea that ours may be one of an infinite number of nearly identical universes where the outcome of just about every single decision, however minute, may play out differently.  Noein presents the rather interesting ideas that all of these existences don't necessarily occur simultaneously.  In other words, jumping from one parallel dimension to another could find a person in a completely different frame of time (which of course explains why Karasu is fifteen years older than the present Yuu).

The science is, for the most part, spectacular.  The writers clearly did their homework when it comes to cutting edge quantum theory and in the instances where it is integrated into the plot, expect to be impressed.  Time travel is never an easy feat to pull off in fiction (believably anyway) and here we have a rare case where it's done with the type of scientific accuracy one might expect from a Michael Crichton novel.  Unfortunately, that's about the kindest praise I can heap upon the show as everything else combined adds up to a potpourri of mediocrity.

Let's begin with the visuals.  The first few computer-generated image sequences will have even the most jaded viewer thinking they've struck gold.  The mechanical/ biological ""beings"" from Shangri-La and the dimension-hopping humans pursuing them are absolutely stunning to behold.  La'cryma's ""Dragon Knights"" as they're called hop through real-space like wraiths and appear and disappear at will with a sizzling hum of electrical disturbance and a blue ""umbilical cord"" trailing behind them.  The cord, it's explained, is what keeps them connected with the dimension from which they came as well as keeps them alive in the event that their mass hadn't transferred entirely to another dimension.  Shangri-La's minions on the other hand are massive floating organisms that could best be described as dozens of conjoined gothic clowns.  They're slow, enormous, and downright freaky (in a cool way).  The battles between these two dimensions are truly one of the show's highlights.

Anyway, once the grandeur of these sequences gives way to the small Japanese town that finds our cast of middle-school-aged protagonists, the blending of CG imagery and flat cells isn't quite so seamless.  The cells are bright, colorful and overly ""cartoony"" when placed before a CG developed background of architecture, foliage, and skies.

The sound is decent, especially the score but the English dub can be a bit frustrating thanks to character name mispronunciations.  It's serviceable for those viewers who refuse to read subtitles but this is a case where the original Japanese vocals certainly surpass the dub work.

About my biggest complaint however has to be the story itself, which despite some incredibly massive undertakings, is way too ambitious for its own good.  Again, perhaps if the scientific element and the time travel bits weren't so intriguing, this could be forgivable but as it stands, what a waste of great theories!

The writers, for whatever reason, began with a cast that was too young initially.  Twelve-year-old school kids are a bit too contrasting with the heavier themes on which the show needs to operate.  Sure there's a lot of silliness, stabs at humor, and general middle school high jinks to keep the viewer amused, there's no denying that it gets tedious really quickly.  Not to mention at 12 years old, fifteen years in the future would make Yuu only 27.  A bit young to have a shock of silver hair and to appear nearly unrecognizable to his friends wouldn't you say?

Anyway, worse still is the pacing, which could best be described as a train wreck.  The plot takes the long way around what boils down to a fairly simple progression and becomes entirely too concerned with nonsense and tangents along the way.  Entire story threads (like Yuu's mother's past) build across several episodes only to drop off never to be heard from again.  Worse still is that in the end you come to realize that they had absolutely nothing to do with the major story arc.  This entire series could probably be trimmed down to twelve episodes of truly interesting material rather than twenty-four bloated segments that often drag on like a night of detention.

It also appears that in effort to emulate some of the themes of existentialism and philosophy that appeals to fans of shows like Evangelion and RahXephon, the prose is deliberately muddled and needlessly complicated.  Even the smallest revelations require incredible patience and commitment from the viewer.  Again, perhaps if the science and ideas presented weren't so interesting, this whole thing could simple be written off as a waste of time.

As it stands, the biggest tragedy of Noein is perhaps the unfulfilled potential contained within.  The concept of inter-dimensional conflict, quantum mechanically-backed reasoning, and time travel based on jumping dimensions makes for some incredibly cool back story.  Add to this the mere possibility of somehow encountering an older version of one's self from a future that will not necessarily come to pass and it becomes clear just how much story-telling potential we're talking about here.

Unfortunately, the flashes of complete and utter brilliance seen in Noein are lost to a muddled plot (that actually gets worse once the clouds of confusion clear), terrible pacing, and entirely too much forced friction & drama between characters.",1261872000,7,7991,5.099923136049193
3026525,4,B000YDBP34,Yes this anime series does have some of the cliche elements so often found in anime. However with its heavy use of quantum physics as one of its main themes it forces you to think more so then many of the mindless martial arts heavy anime so prevalent on the market today. This is a series you can pull out and watch time and again and not get tired of it. The animation quality is superb and shouldn't disappoint.,1245110400,,414,4.253164556962025
3026526,2,B000YDBP34,"I purchased the entire box set in anticipation of a real great anime, and also because the whole thing cost me around 25 dollars. But put the bargain I got on the anime aside, it didn't live up to the praise and 5 star reviews I read and heard about from various sources.

The first couple episodes started off fairly interesting and had me enthralled in the story and its characters. However I'd like to say less than half way through, I found myself making it a chore to keep watching the series. Sure the action scenes were interesting just because how they were stylized, (I've never seen anything like it before), and some of the story arcs were cool such as what everyone was like in the future, and the detective's previous cases, the rest of the series left too much of really nothing on the dinner platter. It was the same old scenario each episode. ""Go to person's house, see how they are, return home, come back next day, see how they are"", and then rarely was there any action or discrepancy to break up that cycle.

I don't mind dialogue very much, but when there really is a whole lot of nothing going on while people are talking, I find the viewing experience to become dull and boring.

I think that the story however was pretty good and creative, but it just wasn't presented in the right manner. Again as stated before the anime was just too boring for me. I guess it's a personal thing but I don't really like stories that much if it's just all talk and no play. Or for that matter just all talk and nothing real interesting to talk about.

Usually I don't watch a lot of anime just because it's expensive and I'm not sure I'll like it. Manga however I can get one volume and see if I like it. It was just because of the bargain of this ""amazing"" series I had to check out what all the hype was about.

Well besides the rare but stylized action scenes, interesting story concept, and few interesting story arcs, not much is left to really ""hype about"".",1239667200,9,1971,4.359673024523161

If you enjoy anime like Pretear, Tsubasa, Totoro, Spirited Away, CardCaptor Sakura etc you may enjoy this.  We bought the first episode to see if we liked it before we bought the set.

3026528,5,B000YDBP34,"I can't say enough good things about this series. I generally don't get into many sci-fi titles because they usually tend to be a disappointment. But I categorize many anime titles under the sci-fi realm - including Sailor Moon and many others. This one doesn't fail to impress the masses.
I didn't know what to expect from this series. However, it was on sale. For the price of the entire series, I can't complain. I've only watched about three episodes so I can only offer a review based on what I've seen. The story involves a bunch of students that coincidentally encounter time travelers who are trying to obtain the dragon ring or bracelet (I forgot the actual name of it). The time travelers are having the hardest time staying where they initially land. They constantly wind up having to travel back to their original time whenever they are so close to obtaining the dragon ring. That's all I can offer at this time.
I must admit I am blown away by this series. There's an intriguing plot going on, the dubbing is great, the animation is distinctive. The characters are all uniquely drawn. In any other anime series I would consider the character design and animation poor and sloppy. However, with this series, it truly is a preference. The style of this series only adds to the mystery of each episode and only provides more realism and emotion to the characters and what they represent etc. This series is so definitely worth adding to your collection.",1228953600,,1463,4.696498054474708
3260976,4,B000YDBP34,"Despite being an anime fan, my tastes tend to be within a certain niche; a familiar type of storytelling that lets me get into the show a lot more easier. As such, a horror series like Hellsing or Hell Girl might not reach to me as quick as something like Fate/Stay Night, Chrono Crusade or the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Noein's more of a sci-fi drama with action peppered throughout as opposed to an all-out fight series like you'd be expecting. This is a series that's meant to get into your brain and make you think rather than just offer simple thrills and despite a couple of flaws, the show was still fascinating in the end.

Haruka Kaminogi is a normal girl in school while her friend Yu Gota has been feeling down lately since his mom has been making him study frequently to prepare for exams and even going as far as to bar him from going out with his friends. While the 2 are out late at night along with 3 other friends, mysterious strangers appear and they all seem to want Haruka. Turns out they're from the dimension La'Cryma which resembles Haruka's timeline in the future while one stranger, Karasu, might be Yu in the future. With talk of needing the ""Dragon Torque"" and the mention of another dimension known as Shangri-La, Haruka and Yu have to save their dimension as well as all others in existence.

While the plot might sound confusing and the concepts of quantum physics, multiple dimensions with infinite possibilities and time travel might make your head explode, don't fear since the series is actually rather easy to understand once you're in the thick of it. Unlike most shows (Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain anyone?) where you probably won't understand it even if you saw the entire series, Noein is just simply revealing its cards a bit at a time rather than obscuring them and making you wonder what it is you saw. It's even got some themes that are actually quite touching and make for good discussion points so the head messing isn't just for fun.

One thing I will say though is that this is a series where patience helps while watching. This isn't the kind of show where each episode will have a battle scene in order to keep you from changing the channel in boredom and not to mention several episodes actually deal with ideas of adolescence, planning for a future you have no idea what it would entail and the growing pains of expectations at a young age. When the fight scenes do kick in though, they are as cool and unique as they come and they become welcome to the show's pace though some might not like they're a little bit scattered and only showing up at a more sporadic place.

Instead of shows like from Gonzo or shonen titles like Naruto, the animation is in the realm of being unique if only because it's vaguely familiar of something you must've watched before but there's something different about it. Noein though is indeed a beautiful show with top transfer and while the use of CG is still noticeable as in other uses in anime, the 2D artwork works quite well and when things get a bit intense, the animation changes to a bit more artwork style with more thicker lines and kind of resembles the Kid's Story short from the Animatrix. The show also has a fantastic store with some pretty good opening and closing numbers but as usual the extras are rather pitiful. The usual textless openers and trailers (despite volumes being released over a period of time, it's still the same trailers included) and a little featurette spread out over the 5 discs. While I'm aware that anime features than to be sparse, it's also something to actually buy something with little added.

While I probably wouldn't have it on repeated viewing anytime soon, Noein didn't waste my time and actually kept me interested throughout so I say give it a shot; never know, might just like it.",1215734400,,3831,4.603221083455344
3260977,3,B000YDBP34,"I love the subject matter of this series - and in its exploration of the subject,  Noein really stepped outside the boundaries of many anime series.

The problem with taking on such a complex idea is that it becomes difficult to avoid plot holes and keep the series concise.  There were definitely moments where I thought ""oh, cool - this is a very interesting turn of events"" but there were also many moments where I thought aspects made no sense even in the structure of the world they set up. Some significant characters could have been developed more and others could have been left on the sidelines.

The English dub can sound a little over dramatic, but it's tolerable. The animation is different from many anime, somewhat odd, but fitting for the nature of the series.  The series is not bad, but you have to be willing to let some things slide - I can do that pretty easily with a cheesy romance comedy anime, but for some reason SciFi that wants to be taken seriously has a more strict set of rules to live up to.

If you're into SciFi Anime - ""Dennou Coil"" is a similar series to Noein that explores alternate dimensions through the eyes of children, but Dennou Coil has a pretty solid grasp on the world it created and very few (if any) plot holes.",1212451200,6,1259,4.452173913043478

Anyway, I didn't have very high expectations when I first started watching the series; it seemed like just another ""girl with special powers"" anime. I was just hoping for a sci-fi action hit w/this one. But I started really getting into the story and the characters, which turned out to be quite rich and complex. I loved the whole quantum physics stuff in the story; the multiverse, infinite futures, etc etc--very interesting. But at the heart of it all is the touching relationship among the young friends and especially the special bond between the protagonists Haruka and Yu. Even though the main characters in this series are elementary school kids, they're not cutesy or contrived; they're depicted in an appealing, natural way. It delivers on the action front as well, with some breathtakingly fluid fight scenes, using an effective blend of 2D and 3D animation, which is enhanced by an unexpected ""sketchy"" style of art for some of the characters, especially the stoic and mysterious Karasu. He's a soldier from the future who seems unusually determined to protect Haruka. I usually watch my anime with subtitles, and I found the Japanese voice for Karasu to be very appealing--really sexy :)",1211414400,,1359,4.964912280701754

I recommend watching it on [...] first before you buy just in case you buy the whole series and you don't like the anime on the first episode.

3260982,5,B000YDBP34,"Plot: 8.5/10

Rich in detail and very complex. The idea of different universes existing for every choice, with the you in that universe going down a different path, is truly fascinating.

I have to mark it down a little because of the slow pacing and unexplained elements of the story. However, I'm sure someone who has a better understanding of quantum physics would add 0.5 to this rating.

Characters: 9.7/10

Watching the main characters develop in Noein is different than in any other anime I've watched. You see how they *possibly* look and act in the future throughout the show (sometimes even more than one possible future version), which creates thoughts and shows the characters from different angles.

My favourite characters were not the main two (Haruka and Yuu), my favourites instead being Ai and Isami. It's both funny and cute seeing them try to hide their feelings for each other as the series progresses, Ai being a fiery red/orange-head and Isami being your average male - Unable to pick-up on signals. Isami's character is probably my favourite due to the future versions of him shown.

The only real bad character point I can think of is Yuu's character - He gets quite annoying with his attitude. The annoyance is worsened by slow plot progression.

Art / Animation: 9.5/10

I can't rate art and animation accurately since I know nothing about it.

Noein looked amazing and fairly unique to me from the moment I first saw it. The start of the show showed that it obviously had quite a big budget, combining CG with excellent art and animation. The show kept up the high quality visuals until the end, although the less important episodes didn't get the attention the more important ones did.

Sound: 9/10

I'm probably being quite harsh here - The soundtrack is outstanding. The the choral battle/action music really gets you excited, the dramatic music does its job, the cute/funny music is fun to listen to... It's all great. My only reason for not rating higher is because there aren't too many tracks I'd want to listen to when not watching the series.

Total: 9.2/10

It felt like they put too many special features on the first disc, and then ran out of features and were forced to repeat a feature from the first disc.

The series itself is very well done, and I would recommend this box set.  For fans of Noein, this is definitely the way to go get the full series.

3260985,5,B000YDBP34,"Dimensional apocalypses, quantum physics, and preteen coming-of-age. Not a lot of series could manage all that.

But in fact, the tightly-woven story of ""Noein"" succeeds in everything it attempts -- an eerie, other-dimensiony storyline  with some complex characters and well-placed comedy. The animation is a bit simple, but the story it's wrapped around is complex and well-developed.

As the story opens, Dragon Knights are fighting a Shangri-la ship over a barren landscape. The ship explodes, taking Karasu with it. In Japan, a young girl named Haruka spots him standing on a church spire.

Months later, Haruka goes on a ghost hunt with her pals Ai, Miho, Isami and the troubled Yuu. Then Karasu appears, and identifies Haruka as the Dragon Torque. As he battles another Dragon Knight, the deranged Atori, Haruka finds that she can unintentionally manipulate time and space. And Karasu seems eerily familiar -- turns out he's Yuu from the future.

Soon the town is swarming with Dragon Knights, all trying to capture Haruka -- except for Karasu, who vows to protect her with his life. And when the Knights kidnap Haruka back to their dimension, La'cryma, she finds that their world is OUR future -- a ruined planet being slowly destroyed by the dimension Shangri-la. And her captors are future versions of her friends, Isami and Ai.

Things don't improve much after Karasu manages to whisk her back to Earth, and hides in her spare room. Haruka and her friends have to deal with more Dragon Knights, a quantum physicist, and a mysterious masked figure -- Noein --  wants Haruka for himself. And Karasu has to deal with Fukurou, a future version of Isami -- to keep Haruka safe, he'll have to fight his oldest friend to the death.

To protect her world -- and her beloved Karasu/Yuu -- Haruka will do anything. But she hasn't reckoned with the devious Noein, and the horrifying secret that drives him to unite all the dimensions...

""Noein"" is a pretty densely plotted show -- coming-of-ages, apocalyptic battles, personal struggles, and action-packed sci-fi. And the all-too-human characters are explored in detail. All of this is expertly woven together, along with some plot twists that only stop when the story is complete.

Fortunately, it has more than just clever writing -- it's full of exquisitely beautiful visuals (Karasu's healing, Noein's fortress), bittersweet memories, and sweetly humorous scenes (Atori regressing into a childlike state). In a way, the sweeter scenes make the struggle against Shangri-la even more harrowing.

And it's loaded down with action -- lots of high-voltage fight scenes, including kinetic air battles, falling lift cars, exploding buildings, bug-eyed guru-ships invading our world, and some holes in the universe. And though the dialogue isn't exactly littered with quotables, it has some great lines (""Even if we are being killed, we can still pretend it's not happening!"").

Most of the characters are given little moments to shine, but the main trio takes center stage. Haruka and Yuu make great protagonists: one is upbeat and kindly, and the other is miserable because of his mother's obsessions. And Karasu is an absolutely stunning anti-hero, whose dark personality is even more striking when you realize that he's a future Yuu who has lost everything he loved.

And the supporting characters are almost as great -- the athletic Ai, flaky Miho, and wannabe tough-guy Isami. These three are totally lovable, and it's painful to see their lives disintegrate in one potential future. And attention is also given to the psycho-turned-amnesiac Atori, the quiet Tobi, as well as Yuu's unhappy mother.

As for the dub, almost all the actors are excellent, and Crispin Freeman is nothing short of phenomenal as the tortured Karasu -- rough, raw, anguished, and sometimes a wee bit tender. The only weak spots, really, are a hammy Bryce Papenbrook and Cindy Robinson with a Southern accent so strong you could smash cinder blocks with it.

Noein has a few animated weak spots, but the storyline is a peerless blend of complex sci-fi, quantum physics, and love. A stunning, harrowing story.",1195257600,54,4135,5.096153846153846

Noein: To Your Self is one unique science fiction anime series watch. The character designs are rather funny-looking because they can appear almost comics-like but much more bright and colorful. The anime series is driven by alternate realities. Haruka Kaminogi the lead character is a girl that has died in many of her realities and in a present reality that diverges in the endless flow of parallel dimensions , Yuu Got
 , a friend of has decided he won't be like the other him's and letting her die. He'll try evrything, so she survives and lives.

The animation of Noein: To Your Other Self was such a surprise from the beginning. It's a styles that greatly differs from many animes out there and would be a big plus for any anime fan. Then the story itself is a strong one and actually with Noein: To Your Other Self was first introduced to the conept of parallel: alternate realities in this anime.

  See: Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku (a Book)

Noein: To Your Other Self has a lot of twists and turns in reference to its story. A lot of what appears one way omes out not being what it is. This anime is very serious and full of the feel of urgency. Even so like in most animes it does contain small moments of humor. Really a recommended watch overall. For those anime fans who like Science Fiction.

If you like mindtwistingly good sci-fy with amazing graphic conception and enthralling drama spiced with hues of humor, look no further.",1309305600,,510,4.806818181818182
3261017,5,B000YDBP34,"I'm going to review the product, not the series (although the series is amazing) - just a heads up.  This boxed set is absolutely gorgeous.  Honestly, whoever packaged this knew what they were doing, which is a refreshing break from most anime boxed sets.  I don't regret a single penny spent on it.  It's got a fresh, stylish look - very color coordinated, and the design elements work well.  The dvd menus are very impressive, very professional.  The audio and subtitle options are great.  The special features are also quite admirable.  I'm pretty hard to please, but every time I look at this set, I feel instantly satisfied.  Make it a purchase!",1297900800,7,650,4.732142857142857
3261018,5,B000YDBP34,"This DVD set sells for $19.99 right now!  I can't believe that it has not sold out yet!

For anyone who appreciates complex, thought provoking series with unique art and animation should throw down the $20 and buy this.  Many other reviews go into details about the characters, plot, and episodes, but I will focus on the similarities between this and other shows so that you the reader might know what to expect if you haven't seen it.

This show is similar to Serial Experiment LAIN in a lot of respects, though it differs greatly in most.  What is similar is the use of parallel worlds in an artistic, hand drawn anime with TONS of plot.  Though LAIN was mostly a cerebral show, NOEIN has a little more action mixed in.  Basically if you liked LAIN, Full Metal Alchemist, Blue Seed, X, or Mai Hime then you will probably like this series.

Be forewarned:  This is hand drawn and presented without computer cropping and trimming so it has an almost manga-like appearance to the animation.  I found it refreshing.

English dubbing is good, but the Japanese voice cast is far superior and fits the theme, story, and characters better.

If you enjoy deep stories, original and likable characters, and lots of replay value, the go for it.",1280966400,,1236,4.645161290322581
3261019,5,B000YDBP34,"Time travel, infinite dimensions, infinite possibilities, and I thought being a kid was supposed to be easy! If you love the concept of time and parallel universes you will love this series. It really makes you think... do I have a doppelganger? What if there are parallel universes? A must watch for the sci-fi fan!",1279238400,,316,4.763636363636364
3261020,5,B000YDBP34,"It's a great anime. Addictive, I tell ya. The animation is interesting and the story is very unique. I'm a fan.",1271548800,,111,4.333333333333333
3261021,3,B000YDBP34,"Well I better clear the air right from the get-go; this review isn't going to be very positive.  And don't for a minute think that it's due to the property's lack of potential.  In fact on paper, this series comes off like a science fiction fan's dream come true: Quantum physics, multidimensional travel, and converging timelines... There's just so much to get excited about.  Unfortunately, it becomes apparent fairly early on that the purity of such concepts is lost in translation toward a muddled mess of psychological-driven drama.  But before we get into all of that, let's take a moment to discuss the cold hard facts.

Noein the Complete Series consists of 5 volumes (24 episodes) spread across 5 discs.  Each DVD comes packaged in a standard sized clamshell case within a cardboard outer slipcase.  Total runtime comes in at 635 minutes and the program wears no rating.  Were it to, I surmise it would likely be around the TV 14 mark, with animated violence, drama, and a little bit of blood.  In all there is no nudity, foul language, sexual situations, or gore.

As is the case with most sub & dub anime, language options consist of both the original Japanese dialog track (Dolby Stereo 2.0) and an English dub (Dolby Surround 5.1) and the option of turning on English subtitles under either if desired.

Extras, which are stretched out across the full five discs include: enhanced 16x9 widescreen presentation, an ""on location"" multi part featurette with the director and a voice actor (Japanese with English subtitles), an image gallery, alternate openings, Japanese promos, and a bunch of Manga anime previews.

The story, which seems straightforward enough when broken down, goes like this: Twelve-year-old Haruka and her clinically depressed buddy Yuu are starting summer vacation with plans to run away from home together.  Yuu seeks refuge from his mother's tyranny when it comes to the area of his studies and Haruka wishes to see her father in Tokyo.  Before any such plans are solidified, they and their schoolmates encounter an odd white-haired man who seems a bit low on patience named Karasu.  Here's the kicker, Karasu claims to be Yuu fifteen years in the future.

At face value, that in and of itself makes the show sound irresistible.  Further investigation only strengthens viewer curiosity.  It turns out that a violent battle is taking place in space-time all around us, particularly between the dimension La'cryma and the dimension Shangri-La.  Subscribers to the multiverse theory of existence will doubtlessly already get the gist of the idea that ours may be one of an infinite number of nearly identical universes where the outcome of just about every single decision, however minute, may play out differently.  Noein presents the rather interesting ideas that all of these existences don't necessarily occur simultaneously.  In other words, jumping from one parallel dimension to another could find a person in a completely different frame of time (which of course explains why Karasu is fifteen years older than the present Yuu).

The science is, for the most part, spectacular.  The writers clearly did their homework when it comes to cutting edge quantum theory and in the instances where it is integrated into the plot, expect to be impressed.  Time travel is never an easy feat to pull off in fiction (believably anyway) and here we have a rare case where it's done with the type of scientific accuracy one might expect from a Michael Crichton novel.  Unfortunately, that's about the kindest praise I can heap upon the show as everything else combined adds up to a potpourri of mediocrity.

Let's begin with the visuals.  The first few computer-generated image sequences will have even the most jaded viewer thinking they've struck gold.  The mechanical/ biological ""beings"" from Shangri-La and the dimension-hopping humans pursuing them are absolutely stunning to behold.  La'cryma's ""Dragon Knights"" as they're called hop through real-space like wraiths and appear and disappear at will with a sizzling hum of electrical disturbance and a blue ""umbilical cord"" trailing behind them.  The cord, it's explained, is what keeps them connected with the dimension from which they came as well as keeps them alive in the event that their mass hadn't transferred entirely to another dimension.  Shangri-La's minions on the other hand are massive floating organisms that could best be described as dozens of conjoined gothic clowns.  They're slow, enormous, and downright freaky (in a cool way).  The battles between these two dimensions are truly one of the show's highlights.

Anyway, once the grandeur of these sequences gives way to the small Japanese town that finds our cast of middle-school-aged protagonists, the blending of CG imagery and flat cells isn't quite so seamless.  The cells are bright, colorful and overly ""cartoony"" when placed before a CG developed background of architecture, foliage, and skies.

The sound is decent, especially the score but the English dub can be a bit frustrating thanks to character name mispronunciations.  It's serviceable for those viewers who refuse to read subtitles but this is a case where the original Japanese vocals certainly surpass the dub work.

About my biggest complaint however has to be the story itself, which despite some incredibly massive undertakings, is way too ambitious for its own good.  Again, perhaps if the scientific element and the time travel bits weren't so intriguing, this could be forgivable but as it stands, what a waste of great theories!

The writers, for whatever reason, began with a cast that was too young initially.  Twelve-year-old school kids are a bit too contrasting with the heavier themes on which the show needs to operate.  Sure there's a lot of silliness, stabs at humor, and general middle school high jinks to keep the viewer amused, there's no denying that it gets tedious really quickly.  Not to mention at 12 years old, fifteen years in the future would make Yuu only 27.  A bit young to have a shock of silver hair and to appear nearly unrecognizable to his friends wouldn't you say?

Anyway, worse still is the pacing, which could best be described as a train wreck.  The plot takes the long way around what boils down to a fairly simple progression and becomes entirely too concerned with nonsense and tangents along the way.  Entire story threads (like Yuu's mother's past) build across several episodes only to drop off never to be heard from again.  Worse still is that in the end you come to realize that they had absolutely nothing to do with the major story arc.  This entire series could probably be trimmed down to twelve episodes of truly interesting material rather than twenty-four bloated segments that often drag on like a night of detention.

It also appears that in effort to emulate some of the themes of existentialism and philosophy that appeals to fans of shows like Evangelion and RahXephon, the prose is deliberately muddled and needlessly complicated.  Even the smallest revelations require incredible patience and commitment from the viewer.  Again, perhaps if the science and ideas presented weren't so interesting, this whole thing could simple be written off as a waste of time.

As it stands, the biggest tragedy of Noein is perhaps the unfulfilled potential contained within.  The concept of inter-dimensional conflict, quantum mechanically-backed reasoning, and time travel based on jumping dimensions makes for some incredibly cool back story.  Add to this the mere possibility of somehow encountering an older version of one's self from a future that will not necessarily come to pass and it becomes clear just how much story-telling potential we're talking about here.

Unfortunately, the flashes of complete and utter brilliance seen in Noein are lost to a muddled plot (that actually gets worse once the clouds of confusion clear), terrible pacing, and entirely too much forced friction & drama between characters.",1261872000,7,7991,5.099923136049193
3261022,4,B000YDBP34,Yes this anime series does have some of the cliche elements so often found in anime. However with its heavy use of quantum physics as one of its main themes it forces you to think more so then many of the mindless martial arts heavy anime so prevalent on the market today. This is a series you can pull out and watch time and again and not get tired of it. The animation quality is superb and shouldn't disappoint.,1245110400,,414,4.253164556962025
3261023,2,B000YDBP34,"I purchased the entire box set in anticipation of a real great anime, and also because the whole thing cost me around 25 dollars. But put the bargain I got on the anime aside, it didn't live up to the praise and 5 star reviews I read and heard about from various sources.

The first couple episodes started off fairly interesting and had me enthralled in the story and its characters. However I'd like to say less than half way through, I found myself making it a chore to keep watching the series. Sure the action scenes were interesting just because how they were stylized, (I've never seen anything like it before), and some of the story arcs were cool such as what everyone was like in the future, and the detective's previous cases, the rest of the series left too much of really nothing on the dinner platter. It was the same old scenario each episode. ""Go to person's house, see how they are, return home, come back next day, see how they are"", and then rarely was there any action or discrepancy to break up that cycle.

I don't mind dialogue very much, but when there really is a whole lot of nothing going on while people are talking, I find the viewing experience to become dull and boring.

I think that the story however was pretty good and creative, but it just wasn't presented in the right manner. Again as stated before the anime was just too boring for me. I guess it's a personal thing but I don't really like stories that much if it's just all talk and no play. Or for that matter just all talk and nothing real interesting to talk about.

Usually I don't watch a lot of anime just because it's expensive and I'm not sure I'll like it. Manga however I can get one volume and see if I like it. It was just because of the bargain of this ""amazing"" series I had to check out what all the hype was about.

Well besides the rare but stylized action scenes, interesting story concept, and few interesting story arcs, not much is left to really ""hype about"".",1239667200,9,1971,4.359673024523161
3261024,4,B000YDBP34,"I bought this anime for my 7 year old daughter.  She seems to enjoy it.  The language is not really bad (no major swear--like ""F"" or SH words). Usually, I watch with her and let her know which words are not appropriate for children.  There is some violence.  This show is not for younger children.  If you enjoy anime like Pretear, Tsubasa, Totoro, Spirited Away, CardCaptor Sakura etc you may enjoy this.  We bought the first episode to see if we liked it before we bought the set. This refers to the digital version --through Amazon unbox.",1238976000,,541,4.525773195876289
3261025,5,B000YDBP34,"I can't say enough good things about this series. I generally don't get into many sci-fi titles because they usually tend to be a disappointment. But I categorize many anime titles under the sci-fi realm - including Sailor Moon and many others. This one doesn't fail to impress the masses.
I didn't know what to expect from this series. However, it was on sale. For the price of the entire series, I can't complain. I've only watched about three episodes so I can only offer a review based on what I've seen. The story involves a bunch of students that coincidentally encounter time travelers who are trying to obtain the dragon ring or bracelet (I forgot the actual name of it). The time travelers are having the hardest time staying where they initially land. They constantly wind up having to travel back to their original time whenever they are so close to obtaining the dragon ring. That's all I can offer at this time.
I must admit I am blown away by this series. There's an intriguing plot going on, the dubbing is great, the animation is distinctive. The characters are all uniquely drawn. In any other anime series I would consider the character design and animation poor and sloppy. However, with this series, it truly is a preference. The style of this series only adds to the mystery of each episode and only provides more realism and emotion to the characters and what they represent etc. This series is so definitely worth adding to your collection.",1228953600,,1463,4.696498054474708
