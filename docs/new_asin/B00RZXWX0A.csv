6937615,5,B00RZXWX0A,"The quality of this film is second to none, through the skilled shots to the professionally recorded audio.  The storyline is one that touches each viewer in a way that I thought was only achievable by the masterminds at Pixar.  The actors that were cast for this film clearly went through years of training, and have taken on their roles as if assigned a new identity (through the witness protection program, perhaps).  Can't wait for the sequel!",1430611200,4,447,4.779220779220779

8696514,3,B00RZXWX0A,"WARNING SPOILERS!!!  With a title like that, this film better deliver, It does in its own way, but it is no gore classic. Ten years ago at a Halloween party in the small town of Havenwood (shades of HALLOWEEN [1978], which took place in the town of Haddonfield), someone dressed in a bald rubber monster mask (Actually made from three separate masks) slaughters everyone at the party with his huge knife (It could almost be called a machete which comes close to the favorite weapon of Jason in the FRIDAY THE 13TH [1980] films), which was thrown in the honor of Judge Richard Blumstein (Chris Corsi). The police show up and see all the carnage, including sliced faces and dismembered body parts, when Officer James Fincher (Matt W. Cody) finds a girl barely alive (The skin is missing from her back) and the masked killer stabs James in the chest, but he survives. The local news and newspaper nickname the killer as ""The Ripper"".
Ten years later, sometime in the 1980's, The Ripper grabs Suzette (Bridgette Miller) as she is walking down the road listening to her Walkman. The next time we see her, Suzette is topless (there is a lot of nudity in this film, always a plus) with a pentagram drawn on her stomach with human blood. The Ripper then stabs Suzette with his big-ass knife in her stomach and disposes her body in a nearby polluted lake. Detective Walter Cobb (Byron M. Howard) and alcoholic Detective James Fincher (the officer who was stabbed by The Ripper ten years earlier) are assigned to the case. James is also a divorced father who has a b**ch of a wife named Jenny (Melissa Roth), who constantly rags on James that he never comes to see his young daughter. The next victims are babysitter Mari (Charlotte Pines) and her boyfriend Brian (Stephan Amenta) After James and Walter see the carnage, James says The Ripper is back, but Walter (who also showed up at the Halloween Party 10 years ago) strongly disagrees. The Town's Coroner, Ryan (Mike Roche) secretly comes to James with proof that The Ripper is back and he is getting back at the people of the town where something bad was covered-up, resulting in the death of a young girl. Before James can do anything, he gets blind, stinking drunk and shoots at an innocent citizen thinking he is The Ripper. Captain Bracken (Patrick Devaney, keyboardist for an 80's band called ""Romeo Penguin"" whose songs play on the soundtrack after Devany got the band back together.) kicks James off the Force while The Ripper kills a naked Kristen (Jackie Wolozin) with his big knife while she is taking a shower (a slight nod to Hitchcock's PSYCHO [1960], including showing blood going down the drain), Jenny is kidnapped by The Ripper and kills Walter.
Ryan tells James that The Ripper needs seven souls in one night to bring his daughter back while Captain Bracken finds Walter's dead body and puts an APB out on James for the murder of his partner. James finds Jenny tied and gagged to a wall of a warehouse and she tells him to take a look at the wall behind him. It is an altar to The Ripper's daughter with photos of The Ripper's victims hanging on the wall with their faces crossed out. The only photos that are untouched are those of James and of teenager Carla (Carmela Hayslett-Grillo). The Ripper suddenly shows up and kills Jenny but, for some reason, leaves James alone. Carla is having a secret party with her best friend Danielle (Danielle Lenore Calhoun), some of her female friends and, of course, some horny guys. The Ripper beats James to the party and the slaughter begins. One girl finds her boyfriend on the bed with a knife sticking out of his stomach and the The Ripper appears at the bedroom door with a chainsaw and slices up the girl's stomach (Funny how no one downstairs hears the chainsaw or the girl's blood-curdling screams). Both Carla and Danielle witness The Ripper's carnage first hand (one frat boy has a knife thrust under his chin). Ryan shows up to save the girls but The Ripper nearly kills him by stabbing him in the back (This is the type of film where people get injuries that would kill most people, but they get up like nothing happened.)
James shows up and discovers all the victims were related to the adults who covered up a hit and run accident by the drunk Judge Richard Blumstein (Now why would a community do that?), the same incident that killed The Ripper's young daughter. The real killer(s) is discovered, James is killed (he was involved in the cover-up, which is probably why he turned to booze) and his daughter is now an orphan and Danielle pumps two shotgun shells into The Ripper, killing him and then sits with Ryan on the front steps of her parent's house. The film was actually made when director/co-screenwriter (with Louie Cortes)/co-producer (with Lindsay Serrano) Manny Serrano (THETA STATES - 2016; M IS FOR MASTECTOMY [2013] , which became a segment of THE ABCs OF DEATH 2 [2014]) made 4 faux trailers for a film that never existed and a short 2011 film called THE RIPPER (which is incorporated into this feature-length film) and the creator of The NYC Horror Film Festival convinced them to make a film based on the trailers and the short.. Serrano used the plot of the first three trailers to make this film (We get to see snippets of the faux trailers during the end credits of this New York City-made film. The film hardly gives us a blood slaughter massacre, but plenty of people die (The bloody makeup effects are nothing to write home about, basically showing knives entering and slicing obvious dummy bodies. The more disgusting effects are shown after the slaughter takes place). The screenplay is also very confusing because we never find out whether The Ripper (played by several different people) is real or supernatural. While James is talking to the father of the hit and run that killed his daughter, The Ripper is upstairs killing Carla, yet he seemingly dies when Danielle shotguns him. It just makes no sense at all. The film tries to show its 1980's roots (on the commentary track, the director tells us it takes place around October 1984) by having Danielle and Carla going to a sparsely stacked VHS rental store (Where we can see such titles as FROM BEYOND, which throws the director's 1984 time period off by two years since this Stuart Gordon's film was made in 1986!). The video store was actually the closed Queens, NY video store Marquee Video and co-screenwriter Louie Cortes & Serrano stocked the shelves with VHS tapes from their collections. Also seen is a VHS cardboard sleeve of ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968) I couldn't make out any more VHS titles because the film was shot on Digital video using the Canon 60D camera and it is obvious that camera operators Louie Cortes and Christian Grillo were not familiar with the camera since it has scenes that start out of focus and some scenes just don't look right (The contrast is too high). Louie Cortes & Lindsay Serrano also co-directed the better-than-normal ATTACK OF THE BRAIN PEOPLE (2013, an 8-part web series turned film, which features many of the actors in this film (Cortes, Manny & Lindsay Serrano also wrote the screenplay). While not exactly a winner, this film has many positive points, like lots of female nudity, gallons of blood and it adheres to many 1980's horror film conventions. Some people may consider this amateurish, but they would be missing the whole point of the film. A Wild Eye Releasing DVD Release. Not Rated.",1505865600,,7440,4.705521472392638

8696516,3,B00RZXWX0A,"The film opens with a slaughter in Havenwood of 23 or so people. Ten years later young nubile girls are being killed in what looks like a Satanic ritual with Detective James Fincher (Matt W. Cody) sometimes on the job.

The acting is bad and the sound quality is choppy. The plot was not well conceived and leaves much to be desired.

The girls who appear naked are said to be under aged in the film, something that is frowned upon.

3 stars for the nudity.

8696521,3,B00RZXWX0A,"Blood Slaughter Massacre is a bit of a dichotomy in that it does create an elaborate plot which is supported by heavily built characters, and yet a lot of the story unfortunately unravels as the story grows. The robust, affirmative character relations, to the over all plots intent, flows more like a really bad cardiogram than a healthy pulse-pounding saga. That is really the only thing that hinders the film from being the massive indie slasher that is should be. Sometimes when writing a story  less is more. Especially with dialog relationship to the characters. Some moments, when explaining the whys and hows of the connection to the enveloping plot, the lines seem over-indulgent and begin to wear on the story lines continuity. Now, that is the bad.

The good things about Blood Slaughter Massacre- is the complete tributary nature of the film to classic horror movies. The little nods and moments that highlight a certain films influence on the writer and directors love of this genre. The total I love the 80s vibe allows for a bit of fun in the films visual appeal. This film, unlike a lot of homage-throwback horrors takes a more serious approach to the slasher genre and I respect that. It gives similar atmosphere to the cult classic days of horror movie making. The soundtrack is thrilling and builds those same chillingly eerie, emotional connections between the story and the viewer. There is blood, blood, and more blood splattered all through this film, which eases the frustrations I had with the psychological aspect of the story that rested on the characters. The killer was a menacing, unstoppable killing machine with a plan.

Even though it sounds like I may not have enjoyed Blood Slaughter Massacre  I did. It is a cool low-budget flick, with a serious approach to the genre. It offers a creepy killer, and even though the plot seemed to be more than necessary it still offered a unique spin while still paying tribute to classic horror. The blood, gore and special effects where above standard for this level of Indie production. Most of the kill scenes allowed a face view graphic slaughter-and the pay off was a nice reward for the scene and the viewer. I loved everything about this movie except the actual character building story lines and their relationships to one another. Every thing else was top shelf-low budget- indie horror enjoyment.",1432598400,9,2376,4.88833746898263
