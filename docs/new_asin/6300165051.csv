7803888,4,6300165051,"Thirty years ago, Laurence Olivier, arguably the greatest actor of the 20th century, embarked on a television project with the other ""Great One"", Jackie Gleason. This was the only time they ever worked together. Some might think this paring of a classically trained Shakespearean actor and an actor known for his brazenness and verbally loud comedic style might be as incompatible as their characters in this teleplay. Not so.

In Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson, the story opens at the funeral for Florence Halpern. The service has ended and Mr. Halpern played by Laurence Olivier notices a solitary man in the distance with a flower in his hand. After a pause, the man walks over and politely asks to drop his flower into the opened grave.

""No flowers at a Jewish funeral,"" says Mr. Halpern, who is aggravated by this stranger and his apparent unfamiliarity with Jewish custom; a stone is placed to mark a visit, not a flower. Yet, Halpern remembers that the deceased loved flowers, so he allows the man to proceed. The distinguished man with the flower is Mr. Johnson, played by Jackie Gleason.

The two gentlemen, both widowers, have agreed to meet again at a quiet supper club to fulfill each other's curiosity about the other. The rest of the story takes place with these two men of rare breeding sitting over drinks and recounting the one subject that they have in common, their love for Florence.

At first the exchange is charming enough until Jackie Gleason's character who is pleasant direct and to the point, admits a platonic friendship with the deceased that began over forty years earlier and had lasted until the day she died. Olivier's character becomes increasing incensed by the apparent arrogance of this smooth tongued stranger who speaks like an angel and he can even recall with detail, how he met Florence at a dress factory where she worked. He was a 21 year old bookkeeper making the rounds. He knocked. She stood up and he describes her as exquisite. All of this drives Olivier crazy with jealousy at the very idea that he indirectly had shared his marriage with the man seated next to him. As the conversation continues and Gleason shares the simple aspects of their encounters; idle discussions about everyday life; family, sickness, aging, art, literature, culture; it occurs to Olivier that this man knew his wife better than he did. Gleason adds that specifics about the other's partners were always kept to a minimum.

Gleason explains that theirs was a pure friendship that did not involve sex. Olivier feels cheated and angry that his late wife kept such a thing a secret and he bursts every now and then with shrieks of anger and emotion. Gleason's demeanor is quiet and friendly and sometimes angry with restraint. Olivier's whining is enhanced by the marvelous facial expressions and his eyes rolling in disbelief. The intent is to evoke emotion that is both funny at times and sweet.

Olivier is defensive and refuses to accept the innocence of the relationship by arguing at every turn. Yet, he finds himself unable to just walk away. He like us are captivated by Gleason's charm and diplomacy, so he doesn't leave. Olivier feels like less of a man. He brags how he served her breakfast in bed all their married life. But he cannot compete with Gleason who tells him that he indirectly hoped he had contributed to Halpern's happiness in life. It is forty years of meddling according to Olivier yet there is nothing he can do about it.

It is a splendid brief work that lasts about an hour and its worth seeing these two greats as their characters exchange moments of fond remembrances, petty masculine boasts of superiority over the other, sadness, laughter, a lot of anger and even a hint of a new friendship to come as they agree to meet again.

I retentioned the tape several times, but the movie stopped and forced a rewind with about 5 min remaining.  Last scene was at the gravesite.  I had hoped to get at least one good play from the tape to convert to DVD.",1363046400,,387,4.175675675675675
