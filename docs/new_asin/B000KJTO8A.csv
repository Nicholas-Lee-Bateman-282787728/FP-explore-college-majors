8325304,4,B000KJTO8A,"An accurate depiction of two groups of guys. One group of former skateboarders/band members that never grew up. The other group of guys with responsibilities that hang out at the bike shop and work on their bikes. An alternative activity to going to bars and drinking or home to their families. The club bonds these guys together and based on their public displays of affection, they are close.",1358294400,,394,4.8088235294117645
8325305,5,B000KJTO8A,"I don't know what to say other than, I was mesmerized by how the choppertown guys actually capured the essence of ""biker brotherhood"" in the original Sinners documentary. So I bought this one too. It's very good, I don't know how to describe it, other than its most of the other story told through more in depth camera work and interviews. I love it. It's like the same video, but not at all. Buy it! That's all I can say. You have to see it to understand!",1303862400,,456,4.252873563218391
