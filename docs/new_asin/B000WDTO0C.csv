8222836,4,B000WDTO0C,"This isn't a deep series for the most part.  Though it does have it moments, it is usually episodic, often silly, and contains characters we are all probably familiar with.  The story takes place in a country trying to recover from war and involves a small team doing their best to make things better.  The team is made up of very familiar types; nothing new here.  Despite that, I found myself liking the series.  Alice is just so over the top as to be somewhat refreshing.  Roland steps outside his stereotype often enough to be interesting (pulling at my heartstrings,) and the others do the same.  There are moments of depth and brilliance I didn't expect.  In short, this is a quick, fun, somewhat silly series that is just a bit deeper than it appears.  Give it a rent.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1327536000,,814,4.551724137931035
8222837,3,B000WDTO0C,"This second installment of the series follows the same pattern as the first as Randel Oland has to find a way to earn the trust of his fellow unit members, while the troops are forced to deal with even more of the ravages of war. Meanwhile the team is caught in a potentially fatal standoff, while having to work without their leader as Alice Malvin's sisters try to play match maker.
What results is a reasonably decent continuation of the story, with a few caveats. I like Randel Oland, though I hope to God that some of these questions get resolved, since it seems like he is actually the least of the teams problems. Also, one has to wonder at Alice Malvin's utterly clueless behavior for much of this set of episodes, such as her reaction to her family's interference, not to mention her complete surprise that the px doesn't have baby supplies. (did this girl just crawl out from under a rock or what?)
I still think that there is much to like about this series, but this set left me more confused than amused. As I said in my first review, this story will require some patience. If you're looking for a quick payoff, you may want to look elsewhere.",1234224000,,1155,4.452830188679245
8222838,4,B000WDTO0C,"This series continues to intrigue me and make me want to learn more. While Alice can sometimes be a little trying, the cast of characters continues to be an interesting mix that plays well off each other. While the story is still moving a bit slow, I'm finding the journey towards a story to be worthwhile so far. While I'd like to know where we're ultimately headed, the series does a great job of keeping the plot hooks coming to keep things smoothly rolling along. This continues to be a smart series worth picking up.",1213920000,,521,4.494736842105263
8222839,2,B000WDTO0C,"I was really excited over this, b/c i'd gotten the manga and though the very few sites I'd heard the anime was pretty much 'ok'. The movie goes through a few stories, delves a little into each character's personalities and I've gotten to really like Stecchin and her voice actresses (Japanese and English!). She's a quirky little character, even if she isn't around for more than five minutes. 'The Big Guy' is an intriguing character, but this volume doesn't really do him any justice. He's just 'there' most of the time, doing his thing and letting the others hop out into the limelight. Orlend is the typical woman-chaser and 'romantic'; I like machis 'just because' he's the typical glasses wearing dorkish character. As for Alice...eh. I sorta get her, and then I don't. This volume is enjoyable, but not completely awesome, and I wish for more of a story development.",1203206400,,873,4.826666666666667
8222840,3,B000WDTO0C,"This show is a study of contrasts - ""Pumpkin Scissors"" the army intelligence  unit that is largely ineffectual until their newest member joins - and he's an army of one, stopping tank crews with his huge pistol.  Lt. Alice Melvin is the pretty and courageous leader of this unit who has the mindset of a  D&D paladin - seeing the world in good vs. bad, black and white terms.  The others of her team help bring her down to earth in relating to the common people.  Two of the men can be characterized as ""the rogue"" and ""the intellectual"" and I find them too dull to write about.  The last fellow is Roland Orland, a giant of a man who is normally mild and quiet but when the need arises, turns on a blue light that turns him into a near-indestructible monster capable of taking on tanks!  Now HE makes this show for me.  I love how fearsome Roland becomes and hearing the villains beg for mercy as he shoots holes in their tanks.  Unfortunately there's not enough of the Frankenstein action to save this show.  The army team is dull, their captain is guilty of bad hair and withholding answers and their activities are rather miscellaneous (deliver supplies, help townspeople with tunnel, investigate nobleman, find a baby's missing mother, deal with Alice's boyfriends, etc) - don't ask me what the overriding plot is.
  Positive points for the show:  Alice is a bit pompous but I think she'll grow into a more sympathetic character - I like her and I love Roland the tank-killer.  The animation is decent quality and the opening is sort of cool so I'm on the fence as to whether I'll continue with this series.  I'd classify Pumpkin Scissors as an ""average"" anime show, worth checking out if you have the time and money but I wouldn't go into this series expecting a lot of action.  Roland hulks out once every other episode on average and it just isn't enough...",1200182400,,1865,4.538922155688622
8222841,1,B000WDTO0C,"This is not, as advertized, a ""Limited Edition"".  there's no extras, no comentarys, no special gifts.  It's the standard volume with a collector's box.  I was highly dissapointed with this.",1197590400,5,189,5.233333333333333
