5088840,5,B007I6T9MY,"My 4-yr-old granddaughter has become a Shirley Temple fan, though she has a lot of questions and has noticed some actors have parts in different movies.  I gave her a Shirley Temple doll which she loves.",1466035200,,203,4.638888888888889
5088841,5,B007I6T9MY,"During Shirley Temple's heyday, a critic remarked that he was waiting for her to reach her teens and become ""awkward and gawky"". This is probably due to the sheer number of Temple's films, all during a period of 5-6 years. If you overdose people on anything--including ""cute""--some are going to forget that these films might not necessarily be aimed at their particular demographic anyway and start squeaking about it. Roughly the same thing happened surrounding ""Beatlemania"" decades later. John Lennon told one interviewer about a minor group of troublemakers acting out at one of their concerts, committing vandalism and bullying fans; ""Security brought some of them round to talk to us and we asked them why they had to act like that. One of them said; 'Well, every time we turn on the radio your records are on'. What could we say to that?"" God preserve us from the easily bored!

I notice that two of the films in this set (plus a couple more in other sets from this series) feature Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, playing a supporting role as he also works as Temple's tap dancing partner. It's unreal how many reviewers mis-identify Robinson as Stepin Fetchit. After all, if there's a black guy in the cast, and he tap dances--he's got to be Stepin Fetchit.",1461974400,,1260,4.806451612903226

5088854,5,B007I6T9MY,"Escape the ugly reality of life and watch Shirley Temple movies.  Hollywood will never recreate these movies because they depict well behaved children, loving parents, properly clothed adults, and devoid of foul language.  When I need to decompress from the insanity that is our world, Shirley Temple is a click away.  The movie ""Blue Bird"" is worth the price of the entire collection.  Do yourself a favor and watch decent entertainment as it should be; when Hollywood got it right.",1419379200,20,483,5.0
5088855,5,B007I6T9MY,"I bought this as an early Christmas present  for me. I remember seeing these films rebroadcast on TV  in the 1950's and 60's and it's a real treat to see them again. Like the previous collections, these are not presented in chronological order. Here's what you get with Volume 3:

1. ""Dimples"" (1936, 78 min.) This film co-stars Frank Morgan, who most will remember from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Both the original black-and-white film and a colorized version of the film are included on the same disc.

2. ""The Little Colonel"" (1935, 81 min.) Co-stars Lionel Barrymore and features a wonderful tap dance routine with Shirley and Bill ""Bonjangles"" Robinson. Both the original black-and-white film and a colorized version of the film are included on the same disc.

3. ""The Littlest Rebel"" (1935, 73 min.) Shirley Temple's second movie of the year set during the Civil War. Also features Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson. Both the original black-and-white film and a colorized version of the film are included on the same disc.

4. ""The Blue Bird"" (1940, 83 min.) This was 20th Ventury Fox's answer to MGM's ""The Wizard of Oz"" that came out the previous year. This film was shot in Technicolor.

5. ""The Little Princess"" (1939, 93 min.) This is Shirley Temple's first film shot in color (Technicolor).

6. ""Stand Up and Cheer"" (1934, 69 min.) This is Shirley Temple's first feature-length film for Fox Film Corporation, although she is not the star. This film is in black and white.

[Note: Discs 1, 2 and 3 are rated PG, discs 4 and 5 are rated G, disc 6 is not rated. No explanation is given for the PG ratings.]

Each film is on a separate disc, and each disc has its own plastic spindle that holds it in place. One disc each is housed in the inside front and the back of the case, and there are two 2-sided leaves that hold the other four discs. The films that are presented in both black and white and in color are on a single disc--one side only. There are no two-sided discs.

These are fun and entertaining films that harken back to a simpler time. They will give you hours of enjoyment. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1419120000,21,2105,4.601604278074866
