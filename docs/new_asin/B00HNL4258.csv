8633811,5,B00HNL4258,"Both fun and challenging is how I would describe Paul Hedderman, and a cut above the typical non-duality spiritual teachers.  His years in recovery give him a unique angle on the human mind.  The DVD explores some of his history and a lot of his philosophy, through a series of interviews and excerpts from talks, giving a personal glimpse of someone whose core spiritual truth is that our idea of being long-lasting independent entities is not true.
The film is well-produced, and features several songs by Kirtan artist David Newman.",1388707200,5,535,4.933333333333334
