2604570,2,B000GBEWSE,"Adult fans of ""G.I. Joe"" toys, cartoons and comics books from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s won't find much to like about the mega-popular brand's latest incarnation, but its new fans will appreciate it.

Compared to the classic 1980s Joe cartoons, there are few funny moments, very little characterization and no complexity among the villains. The classic arguments between the mercenary Destro and the megalomaniacial Cobra Commander are gone. A new part-robotic Cobra minion seems a likely competitor with Cobra Commander, proving that bad guys always fight among themselves, but his plot never gets going. Characters are just pawns for the video game story, which is satisfying on a visual level, but will be boring to anyone looking for much of a plot or even some cartoonish jibes among such formerly cranky and opinionated troops as Tunnel Rat, Heavy Duty, Scarlett and Snake Eyes.

Boys who like the admittedly cool toys will dig watching the figures and toys at work. But only the most G.I. Joe-crazed of nostalgia fans will find these new Joes worthy of a watch. Gone is the potentially timely idea of a U.S. special-forces unit of well-trained but outmatched experts and soldiers fighting against an increasingly vicious, backstabbing, egotistical enemy terrorist force. 9/11 has done away with terrorists as a bad guy for kids, and now it's all anime-style battles and superhero costumes.",1160870400,7,1397,5.149779735682819
2604571,1,B000GBEWSE,The Price for this is a little too much for 5 episodes. On top of it the show was made in Japan and theres no Japanese language track or subtitles. so I wouldn't bother would this dubbed version cause they change the dialougue alot. look for the japanese version instead.,1159660800,,271,4.44
2604572,3,B000GBEWSE,My son who is 8 really enjoys sigma 6 so I am glad it is finally out on dvd.  As every Sigma 6 has all the gadgets and action like the last series and has also managed to include the same cheesey humor that the 1980s GI joe used to have.  I would give it a thumbs up it should make a great Christmas present for my son.  my rating is not for this particular dvd but rather for the series on tv.,1151625600,,394,3.7228915662650603

8130454,4,B000GBEWSE,"While there are times like SPEED RACER THE NEXT GENERATION that I like having the episodes run together in a movie format this isn't one of them.  I would of preferred an episode selection episode of the suppose five episodes that make up this DVD.  The fact that I absolutely loved the SIGMA 6 normal opening credits it was a disappointment that the regular opening song and images weren't use at the start of this DVD.  Other than that I really liked having at least some of my favorite Sigma 6 episodes on this first strike DVD.  Shame they couldn't do as season or partial season set like G I Joe Renegades when they split series into part 1 and part 2 release.
While Joe Renegades had my favorite version of Tunnel Rat  I think Sigma 6 had the best version of Jinx in any of the Joe series. Speaking of other G I JOE releases, Sigma 6 has a nice flashback story for Venom and Valor special showing that Sigma 6 is a follow of that movie special.",1388016000,,950,4.284916201117318
8130455,4,B000GBEWSE,"I grew up on the 80's-era Joes as presented by Sunbow and I still dig the Joes. The Sigma Six feel is certainly different from that first animated outing. That said, its really cool to see the characters and the toys that are on the shelves in the heat of battle. Yeah, I get it - it's a cartoon made to sell those toys, but it doesn't make the clash of good and evil any less fun.

Duke, Scarlett, Snake and all the other Joes go head to head with Cobra commander and all his goons in full-on anime style. Vehicles like the Ice Dagger and Rhino are great in the heat of battle and I'm sure this movie provides a lot of fodder for the new Joe fans as they act out their own battles between Cobra and Sigma Six.

I only wish that the rest of the Sigma Six series was available for purchase. I would really enjoy seeing what they did with the rest of this show.",1316390400,2,859,4.047058823529412
8130456,5,B000GBEWSE,"This movie was not made for adults who grew up in the 1980's.  The animation is excellent and appropriate for the time in which it was made.  Most of the characters are familiar but updated.  A mistake was made by heavily using the term Sigma 6 and practically hiding the fact that this work was GI Joe based.  The nostalgia of the 80's cartoon is wonderful, but I actually prefer this cartoon.  It is of a much higher quality.",1225152000,,427,4.3544303797468356
8130457,5,B000GBEWSE,"This is a great revamped version of GI joe,its got some of the best original characters as well as some new members. If you like gi joe then i'm sure you will like this dvd pilot movie of gi joe sigma six. If you enjoy modern cartoons with lots of action. Then this is one for you.",1217030400,,281,3.9473684210526314
8130458,5,B000GBEWSE,one thing comes to mind this dvd is terrible it could have been better only five or 6 episodes on one disc dissapointing its a shame that there isn't a box set out for this series i enjoyed the new series and the classic series to it sucks it has been taken off the air i would have like the complete set of thise seires and series 2 as well to completer the collection of this set.,1200009600,,382,3.9740259740259742
8130459,2,B000GBEWSE,"As a G.I. Joe fan and collector since 1986 I even enjoy watching the original series today. As a native German I liked both Joe and Cobras alike. Both factions owned a number of great characters! Some good guys some bad guys but all of them were unique!

Though I generally like Manga-Style movies and especilly the female characters look cuter than ever, I don't consider G.I. Joe Sigma 6 a worthy heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...

Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!",1180656000,3,741,4.4411764705882355
8130460,5,B000GBEWSE,"It's terrible that this series is getting such low reviews. It's a great series and a fabulous toy line. I have been an avid fan of G I Joe for many years. Now being a 27 year old and still owning my original figures I find it quite enjoyable to see the series in an anime style. The fighting between Snake Eyes and Stormshadow are INCREDIBLE. The way two ninjas going at it should be. I also own all the G.I.Joe boxed sets and find that I fall asleep moreso to the old episodes than I do to the new series cause there is so much more action and adventure with the new. I highly recommend this movie, its a great combination of Western Characters with an Eastern Style!",1167350400,8,669,4.1937984496124034
8130461,1,B000GBEWSE,"As a fan of G.I. Joe for many years I picked this movie up.  I loved the cartoons from the 80's and I didn't mind the last few movies they did in CGI.  But, this pile of monkey crap starts off with with Hawk telling Duke about how he fought Cobra 20 years ago... as if Duke was not there!  In fact, as this show starts off Duke is just named to the Joe team.  It made my brain hurt trying to figure out how in the heck this could fit into the time line of the last two movies since Duke was in both of them.  The morons who make the new Joe cartoon need to do their homework a little better then they have.  It would take an idiot to some how not remember Duke has been a Joe for a very long time.

I also can't stand the new Anime style.  TV is flooded with this crap and there is little for today's kids in the way of quality cartoons.  The new Joe Anime is childish and silly, lacking the depth of even the simple cartoons of the 80's.

The first Joe cartoons were great becasue they were different then other shows on the air at the time.  The new Joe tried too hard to be just like every other chop chop bang bang anime out there, and that is not a good thing.  The stories are weak, if there even is a story.  There are no morals to be learned or any reason to think when watching it.  I think this is the kind of crap that eats children's minds.

But the Original G.I. Joe DVD's and leave this for poor saps with half their brain missing.",1162684800,6,1445,3.917525773195876
