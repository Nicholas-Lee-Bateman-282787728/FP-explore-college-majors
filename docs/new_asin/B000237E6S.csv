8021019,5,B000237E6S,This is a fun workout.  I did it with my daughter and we didn't feel like we were exercising at all.  I broke and sweat with this one and didn't even know I was working that hard.,1361836800,,179,3.810810810810811

Overall this is well done video.  The workouts are fun and set to upbeat music.  It is very energizing, and you are continually moving without wasted down time, so it gives a good cardio workout.  I think beginners will want to do 1 section at a time, and intermediate/advanced may want to do 2-3 sections at a time (the DVD is programmable).

I thought the African sections were the most intense, there is a lot of constant stepping/hopping/kicking that works up a good sweat.  The Latin and Hip Hop sections are fairly fast paced, but I didnt' feel they were as tiring as the African sections.

In each section, the instructor starts by doing parts of each dance one step at a time, and then adds up all the steps in the end to make one choreagreaphed routine.  People who don't have dance experience may get frustrated because she does introduces each step fairly quickly.  However, those with some dance background will appreciate that the instructor continously moves during this video, there is no down time standing around watching her do baby steps; you are constantly moving about practicing some motion.

The dance moves are modified to be aerobics workout style to keep the routine going and to not make the moves too complicated for people who don't have indepth dance experience.  So you won't be learning ""pure"" dance moves (I don't think most people would mind this, but if you're picky about this kind of thing, you might find the moves to be cheesy).",1162598400,4,1612,4.741935483870968
8021021,5,B000237E6S,"I love African dance and when I came across this DVD I couldn't pass it up.  This DVD consists of 2 workouts.  The first one is called African Dance Workout. It has a 7 min warm-up, 40 min African dance aerobics, 3 min cool down and a 5 min upper body workout.  The second one is called 3 Flavors Aerobic Dance Workout and consists of a 5 min warm-up, 3 mini workouts (African, Latin and Hip Hop) which are approximately 20 minutes each and 4 min cool down.  You can mix and match workouts on this DVD.

The music consists of African/Caribbean drum beats and melodies, Latin and funky Hip Hop rhythms. It makes you want to move!!  Very motivating.  Debra's cuing is excellent and the moves are absolutely wonderful and not that difficult to learn.  You will definitely sweat on this DVD. Beginners may need to take it easy on the first workout.

At the end of each dance routine she challenges you to do the dance steps without her verbally cuing you.  She does jester some of the movements so that you won't get totally lost.

This DVD brought back the fond memories I have of taking African dance in college.  Excellent quality production.  Good job Ms. Bono!!!",1158883200,4,1163,4.480952380952381
