8672569,3,B00MIA0IS4,"This documentary is a bit strange but it is like spending time wth Duane Michals whom I have met.  Definitely glad I purchased it, but it is not the definitive documentary on this artist or his work.",1470441600,,199,4.378378378378378
8672570,3,B00MIA0IS4,"I love Duane Michals, have many of his books, but this documentary was a bit disappointing, could have been done better. Still, if you are a fan of Duane Michals, like I am, you'll probably want to see it at least once.",1434412800,,219,4.238095238095238
8672571,5,B00MIA0IS4,"5 stars all the way! This beautiful film is an art piece in and of itself. Wonderful music, artistic scenery, and the humor and joyfulness of Duane comes out in every scene. Great to see several of the scenes where he shows the viewer how he actually sets up and photographs one of his story lines, and tells why he links words to his pictures. So many people have a theory about things in life and set out trying to portray their theory in art, or writing or another mode of expression. Duane is very original in that he opens himself up to life and expresses what he sees there as it is, rather than trying to get what he sees to fit into some preconceived concept of how it should be seen.

His work is very buddhist in the way he takes life as it is, and stays focused on what he sees. The film does a great job of explaining just how Duane accomplishes this, and in many ways is very much like David Hockney in trying ever new and interesting ways throughout his career to express his themes.

All in all, just the best.",1422576000,2,1025,4.197969543147208
