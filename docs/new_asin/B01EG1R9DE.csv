8758543,1,B01EG1R9DE,"You all must have been paid for the great review...  such a shame misleading us.  I received the much anticipated movie filmed in Murray Kentucky yesterday and found time in my busy schedule to view it this morning. SMALLTOWN is An Edward Dublin film 109 minutes long of profanity. The only casting requirement was your ability to use the F- word extensively. Although there were a few recognizable shots of my wonderful town, I was abashed by the indignity given to Murray. Shame on you!!!! YOU CAN FIND MY COPY IN THE TRASH.",1476489600,,526,4.645161290322581
