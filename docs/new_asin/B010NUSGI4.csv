7315251,5,B010NUSGI4,Great! Thanks:),1443571200,,15,7.0
7315252,4,B010NUSGI4,"Not sure how the blu-ray is but I assume it'll look pretty good (1080i from Eagle Rock Entertainment, & they Usually do a very good/great job).  I saw this show in the theater earlier this year & the audio wasn't that good at all, but I'm not going to expect the same results on the blu' & 2-CDs.  My 4-Star review is for the show I saw in theaters, & it was pretty good (audio issues aside).  I like that this appears to be a straight forward Concert film, no in-between song banter or video clips of whatever.",1441670400,4,511,4.1938775510204085
7315253,2,B010NUSGI4,"Packaged as 3 cds. Stupid lame nonstandard packaging, will have to buy a Blu-ray case for it, ok concert.  No self promotions by the band.",1441584000,,138,4.52
7315254,3,B010NUSGI4,Great Blu Ray video with a sub-par audio mix. The CD is outstanding.,1441584000,2,68,4.3076923076923075
7315255,5,B010NUSGI4,The boys from Boston are at there best in this live concert.,1473292800,,60,4.083333333333333
7315256,5,B010NUSGI4,"Really good concert, lots of great songs and of course Steven Tyler proves why he is one of the best front men in Rock & Roll history.",1471046400,,134,4.0
7315257,4,B010NUSGI4,Only 4 stars because the lead vocal is not enough loud.,1469923200,,55,4.090909090909091
7315258,5,B010NUSGI4,Aerosmith Rocks Donington 2014 fits my collection of Donington concerts perfectly.,1469836800,,82,6.545454545454546
7315259,4,B010NUSGI4,"Finally they release a video without interviews in the middle of it. But the sound is terrible. Plus, why 1080i resolution instead of 1080p?",1467244800,,140,4.875
7315260,3,B010NUSGI4,"I bought this, and yes, the cd's are great, but.......... for some reason, I cannot get the video to play on my Sony blu-ray player here in the U.S. States.
Anyone else have this problem ?",1460764800,,188,4.25
7315261,3,B010NUSGI4,"Good concert, but the sound quality isn't up to par. I have a high end home theater setup, and this Blu ray just doesn't stack up to many of the others I own.",1459728000,3,158,3.8181818181818183
7315262,4,B010NUSGI4,"Pretty decent concert.....Tyler cant quite hit the notes the way he use to..and...the band looks about ready for the retirement home...but it was enjoyable....great sound...and Tyler did do an exceptional job on Dream On (especially considering he is 118 years old, lol)",1458777600,,270,5.4523809523809526

7315264,5,B010NUSGI4,"Fantastic show from the guys that includes so many of their very many hits,  The inclusion of the double cd from the concert is a nice addition.",1457136000,,144,4.333333333333333
7315265,2,B010NUSGI4,"THE SOUND EVEN THAT IS DTS-HD IS NOT GOOD AND IS NOT 1080P IS ONLY 1080i, have much better concerts than this blu-ray.",1452988800,,118,4.173913043478261
7315266,5,B010NUSGI4,"For me the best Aerosmith Live DVD/Blu-ray, no interview between the songs unlike the previous ones so we're not losing intros or even the pace of the concert. Perhaps some of the visual effects were a little too much but that's ok because there are very few of them.  The concert itself was good, great performance from the band and a crowd that was totally there. And LOVE the video and audio quality on the blu-ray.",1449705600,5,418,4.5

8722819,3,B010NUSGI4,"I love Aerosmith!  Ive seen them twice and this concert is better than any I have ever seen. But the sound quality isn't very good at the beginning of the show and seems to get better later on. Not sure why this is...
