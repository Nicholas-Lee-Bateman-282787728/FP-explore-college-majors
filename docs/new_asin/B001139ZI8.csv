3058837,4,B001139ZI8,"The Hittites were a Bronze Age Empire from what is modern day Turkey. Much of what archeologists know about the Hittites comes from clay tablets found in their capital. The two-hour DVD tells the story of the Hittites in chronological order and was narrated by Jeremy Irons. The redramatizations were helpful in showing what clothes, armor, equipment and cities looked like. They also added a historical flavor to this story of this once lost ancient civilization. Jeremy Irons does a masterful job telling about the rise and fall of the Hittites and their 500-year reign over Anatolia. I especially liked where Jeremy Irons correctly pronounces the Hittite kings names like Muwatalish, Mursilis and Suppiluliumas. I thought the battle of Qadesh could have been better explained with more detail and a better explanation about the neighbors of the Hittites. But that would've meant a three or four hour DVD...too bad! Over all I gave this documentary four stars because this is the perfect historical story for beginners like me, who aren't classically educated and haven't spent half our lives digging up ancient cities. A must buy for history buffs like me.",1219622400,28,1159,5.105263157894737
3058838,2,B001139ZI8,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, thinking that it would be a straight historical/archeological documentary.  And indeed, it did have all the elements of such documentaries - computer reconstructions, expert commentary, etc.  Unfortunately, the makers of this DVD must have thought that this was not sufficient, and they also included scenes that were more like historical dramas or vignettes of Hittite kings and queens.  Since so little is known about these people, this was stretching the story way beyond the available material, and frankly seemed just silly.",1216684800,15,571,5.393258426966292

8240043,5,B001139ZI8,A really good and accurate overall reflection of the Hittites. A useful tool for the sutdent of Ancient Near East Culture.,1468195200,,122,4.857142857142857
8240044,5,B001139ZI8,"A great place to start learning about the first Indo-European empire in the Mediterranean basin! The Hittites ruled central Anatolia about a thousand years before the common era. What is most astonishing is that unlike every other empire from the Bronze Age, we have their archives intact and since about the beginning of the 20th century, scholars were intrigued to translate the baked clay tablets  storing their government records. In this documentary, Jeremy Irons outlines the development of this civilization and thanks to the translation of Hittite documents, we know very much about this Biblical-era people and the personalities of some of their rulers.  If you are interested in ancient history and the Bronze Age and have exhausted every credible source on Egypt, get started learning about the Hittites!",1462579200,,815,5.310077519379845
8240045,5,B001139ZI8,"Jeremy Irons narration of this absolutely magnificent documentary is superbly done. This is by far the best documentary I have seen in a very long time, and is also the best documentary on the Hittites I have ever seen. If you want to learn more about the Hittite empire ( and it's hard to find anything on the Hittites in general) this is your A to Z on them. It's more like a ten out of ten. I paid a kings ransom for this dvd and it is worth ever penny.",1441929600,,456,4.021978021978022
8240046,3,B001139ZI8,"I try to watch this every chance I get when it comes on television. This history is one of utter fascination. Even if the Hittite names are almost unpronounceable, the history is stunning.  BUT NOT AT $124.00 for the two-hour DVD.",1410048000,3,230,4.609756097560975
8240047,5,B001139ZI8,Loved this program on tv.  Well done in showing the story of these people.  Jeremy Iron's voice as the host is so clear and I marveled at his pronunciation of the complicated names.  You can only wonder what the world would be like today if this civilization hadn't ended.  I would love to watch this show again and i can if I want I can buy this video from Amazon.  Well done.,1408406400,,377,4.180555555555555
8240048,5,B001139ZI8,"When I first saw this documentary on the 'Smithsonian Channel', it caught my eye. Once more 'AMAZON PRIME' had this documentary in its listing.  I know this dvd is no longer in print. The price was steep $93.94 with shipping.  However, the information in this dvd was very enlightening!!  The audio and video in this dvd  was 'FIRST CLASS'!!  No complaints!!  I appreciate being an 'AMAZON PRIME' member!!!",1408147200,,406,4.897058823529412
8240049,5,B001139ZI8,"This captivating documentary about an unfortunately-obscure civilization really tells the story well.  The dramatizations are well-played, and I would have liked to hear more of that beautiful-sounding language being spoken.  Finding through DNA testing that I have a strong West Asian component, I would be proud to consider Hittites as probable ancestors or cousins.",1372291200,2,368,5.796296296296297
8240050,5,B001139ZI8,I watch a lot of documentaries on TV.  Saw this on the Smithsonian Channel and decided to buy a copy so I could watch it without the commercials.  I think it is a great video.  I wish there were more like it.  Jeremy Irons is a great narrator.  The cinematography is reminiscent of the 1970's and looks astonishing.  The dramatizations are fantastic.,1329868800,9,350,4.564516129032258
8240051,5,B001139ZI8,"Our OAT guide previewed this video with our tour group before visiting the Hittite Museum in Ankara, Turkey.  It opened a new understanding of Hittite history and the important role it played in the Middle East for some nearly 2000 years.  The museum holds a wonderful collection of artifacts...many of which were discovered within the last 100 years.  The ""dig"" photos were truly interesting.  After our return we purchased the video from Amazon so we could better share our experience with friends and family.",1322956800,4,511,5.0476190476190474
