8177643,5,B000NHDFBQ,This is a great documentary and has been in moratorium for many years. I can't but believe keeping this out of the public was by design.,1405209600,,136,4.269230769230769
8177644,5,B000NHDFBQ,"Here is a modest budget production; to my knowledge, the second documentary produced by ""Rush To Judgement"" writer-attorney Mark Lane, in his continual (to this day) quest for the truth of 11-22-63, or shall we say, truth that there is no hard evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald fired a single bullet on that tragic day.

Officer Roger Craig, of the Dallas Sheriff's Department, was no conspirator, accessory, just an underpaid law enforcement officer, told on a Friday morning to stand watch of the proceedings on the parade and not to get involved with Secret Service, or the event itself.

The easy going, mild-mannered (decorated) officer (a Combat Veteran) could not help but ""get involved"" after he heard shots from around the corner...saw a motiorcycle policeman run up the grassy knoll...and saw, in the a.m. of the 22nd, Oswald himself in the passenger seat of a station wagon.

More significantly, he says he saw, firsthand, the rifle left on the 6th floor of the DSBD. But...*what* rifle?

This documentay is fascinating for many reasons, but primarily as one man's eyerwitness account, not a string of ""related"" events, which draws a conclusion.

Now the Historian can draw his/her own conclusion based upon something, someone very *real*.

Video-audio quality: passable only, but this should not deter the eager sleuth.",1335398400,3,1329,5.12962962962963
