8642123,3,B00IHYO5YS,"Doesn't completely suck.  HA!  This is a video that discusses Bowie, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop as advertised.  The people they interview actually knew them which is a plus.  Angie Bowie is one of the ones that discusses Bowie and she's actually not offensive.  Jayne County and Jimi Lalumia and Leee Black Childers all with their own axes to grind are used to cover Bowie so well --Ouch!  Paul Trynka the biographer was in there.  I did learn a few things about Iggy Pop and Reed.  The people they interviewed for those two seemed to like and respect them and the footage was okay.  If you're a big Bowie fan you can miss this one really.  However, if you'd like to hear about Iggy and Lou and how they intersected this is sort of a nice introduction to that.  It's at least interesting.  Look for a cheap used copy.  Also be forewarned that this video is put out by ""Smokin"" which is one of the DVD dudes that put out same videos as ""The Collector's Forum"" so don't buy two DVD's on these three cause I'd bet they will be the same video.  So lotta words, best I can say is it doesn't completely suck.",1466294400,5,1097,4.287804878048781

David Bowie & Lou Reed: The Thin White Duke vs. The King of New York is a 107 minute DVD that explores the intertwined careers of two of the greatest pop stars ever.
The build up to the period to the 70s is assessed and an interesting insight in to the Andy Warhol/Velvet Undergound axis gives us essential background in to the 60s apprenticeship served by Reed. At the same time Bowie was across the Atlantic delivering twee, inoffensive, uninspiring pop; and, there were no indications that his star would ever ascend.
However, the period 1971-1973 had two worlds colliding as Bowie developed a more colourful musical and theatrical landscape; and, in turn he had become positively influenced by the multi-media achievements in New York.
The nascent solo careers of a dynamic duo were enriched via a bond that occurred and from being an admirer Bowie was then hugely responsible for resurrecting the undoubted seminal skills of Lou Reed. David produced Lou and his career kicked on and at the same time Bowie was creating some truly original music of his own.
Also part of an unholy triumvirate was Iggy Pop whose own segment in the story is quite significant. The sound of The Stooges impacted upon Bowie and later on down the road a further collaboration blossomed as Iggy tied up with the lustrous London lad. Along the way there is a kaleidoscope of charismatic characters such as Marc Bolan who also take a central role in the proceedings. The glam and glitter of an electric era in the aural annuls is revived!
Expert analysis and striking footage make this product an extremely worthwhile venture. The early years of a groundbreaking decade filter through this release and a sumptuous story offers reflections of two tune transformers. This diligent DVD pays testament to some of the significant seminal substance from the vaults of a pair of sadly deceased sonic superstars. The music of David Bowie and Lou Reed deserves the utmost respect and rock n roll is a richer place for their input. Thank you to the Duke and the King! Your memories will always shine bright!",1455840000,17,2119,4.784153005464481
