4217035,4,B003XKQ602,"why does there have to be written words for every review.  It is an okay video and if I remember correctly, somewhat meditational due to the pace of the movie",1362700800,,158,4.266666666666667
4217036,5,B003XKQ602,"Excellent quality on Blu-ray disc. The scenery is fantastic and the accompanying music is good. A must for
the nature lover.",1361923200,,124,4.9523809523809526
4217037,3,B003XKQ602,"A nice video, showing many wonders of Alaska.  I made a trip to Alaska this summer and wanted something as a reminder of the trip.  Actually though much of what is on the video tells me I need to take more trips to Alaska to see the vast wonders.  The video itself is nice, but far from the overall quality of a production like ""Planet Earth.""",1361750400,,343,4.166666666666667
4217038,4,B003XKQ602,"Since we loved the DVD version of Echoes of Creation, I thought that the Blu-Ray version would even be greater in technical quality.  However, after viewing both the Blu-Ray and the High Definition versions of the combo pack, I do not detect much, if any, significant difference between these and the original DVD, perhaps a miniscule  improvement. In any case, the difference was not that important. Surprisingly, the combo pack is a better value than the single DVD.",1347926400,10,468,4.987179487179487
4217039,5,B003XKQ602,"I have never dwell into this kind of stuff/genre before but after trying out Echoes Of Creation on DVD, I've decided that I must have it on blu ray to give it further justice and for the hi-def experience as the visual is simply breathtaking and relaxing for the eyes and the music that accompanies it is simply sootihing to the ear. Both audio and visual gels really well. I can't wait to receive my blu ray disc but for now, I shall pop in the DVD and enjoy it.

Note : For an unforgetable experience, you must have at least a reasonable sound system setup to really appreciate this disc as without it then it is just another ordinary boring disc.",1342051200,3,649,4.319672131147541
4217040,5,B003XKQ602,"This is one of the most beautiful videos I have ever seen.  It is something you can watch after a difficult day, or any time you need to lift
your sagging spirit.  Gorgeous picture and music.  Whether you watch it with or without narration, turn up the volume, and be transported for the next 40
minutes.",1327104000,12,304,4.392857142857143
4217041,4,B003XKQ602,This disk is a blu-ray version of a short film that briefly touches on some of the majesty of nature. Great photography and soundtrack by David Arkenstone are part of this production but it is more of a short film than something of greater depth. While a great appetizer it is not the main course I expected. Nickman is accomplished but simply doesn't produce this at the level one would hope.,1290816000,,393,4.549295774647887
4217042,5,B003XKQ602,This DVD is absolutely the best viewing for relaxation.  Trouble going to sleep or getting back to sleep?  Get this DVD!,1287619200,5,120,4.666666666666667

4217044,5,B003XKQ602,"This is a remake of True North made back in the 90s but the new Echoes of Creation on Blu-ray is much clearer, has a lot of extra seances not on the original.",1445212800,,158,3.8181818181818183

4217048,4,B003XKQ602,"This is a grade ""A"" nature bluray! I wish it were longer than 40 mins. Very peaceful and soothing. Sequoia National Park is my favorite and I wish even more time was spent filming those great trees. The really cool thing about these Jan Nickman videos are that you can play it without the narration and just the wonderful music. Also you can do ""endless loop"" as a good thing for background viewing at a party,etc. This and ""Sacred Earth"" are both worth owning. A word about packaging A) the white box says : As Seen on  Public Television and is older packaging with the same quality Bluray & DVD.B) Is new packaging that may not come with a slip cover. The new packaging is green like the forrest. I know that Sacred Earth Productions is trying to change to the new packaging but are having trouble with the ""process""at Amazon. So nice to sit back and see the best of nature as presented by Jan Nickman and crew. I will buy more from Jan Nickman and Sacred Earth Productions LLC in the future. I'm a very happy camper!",1437004800,,1019,4.391534391534392

4217052,5,B003XKQ602,Awesome... Not a big fan of the narration but you can mute that. Why do people think we want them talking at us constantly? The scenery speaks for its self!,1430870400,,156,4.233333333333333

4217062,4,B003XKQ602,I purchased this after viewing the program on PBS.  I wanted to have it to run as a background program for other activities.  The DVD has an option to play images and music without any of the script.  It's perfect for my use.  Very pretty and relaxing.,1413676800,,252,4.297872340425532

4217073,5,B003XKQ602,Great visuals.  Saw this program (with intermissions) on PBS during a pledge drive.  Decided to order it from Amazon.  I like to put it on without the narration and just listen to the music with the fantastic visuals.  I often have it playing in the background when friends come over to have something nice to show on the HDTV when we're just visiting.,1406592000,,352,4.5396825396825395
4217074,4,B003XKQ602,"Some of the best video I have ever seen, makes one feel real small in face of some of the natural wonders that are to behold in nature.",1405814400,,135,3.857142857142857
4217075,4,B003XKQ602,Lovely photography and soothing soulful music,1405728000,,45,6.666666666666667
4217076,5,B003XKQ602,It has spectacular photography and the music is so beautiful and soothing. I put it on to relax or for back ground when I am paying bills or other mindless tasks...like opening junk mail. It is how I motivate myself to do these dull chores. I also use it to fall asleep to when my mind won't turn off. Wonderful!,1402704000,,312,4.216666666666667
4217077,5,B003XKQ602,"Provides a meditative experience. Turn off the lights. Start the program and lose yourself in the music, narration and visual wonder. It is a truly moving experience that can be enjoyed over and over.",1394755200,,200,4.911764705882353

4217079,2,B003XKQ602,"Watching this on PBS. The photography is nice. But the new age-y, nonsensical babble that is the narration pretty much ruins the whole experience.",1390003200,,146,5.125
4217080,5,B003XKQ602,"a great dvd for travel information and scenery, a wonderful price for this dvd/ blue ray combo pack, well worth the price",1387929600,,121,4.545454545454546
4217081,5,B003XKQ602,"All of the ""fly over"" videos broadcast on Public Broadcasting are wonderful, but this one touched my heart most of all because of the area it was filmed; Alaska and the great Pacific Northwest of the United States (Washington/Oregon and parts of Northern California).

The movie starts in Northern California then moves up to Oregon and Washington, then to Alaska. The quality of the film, the editing, the subject matter, the music, the narration, all flawless. It's peaceful, beautiful, truly breathtaking, and magical - no other way to describe it. The HD quality, the clarity almost seems unreal, but it isn't. It's even better than seeing it with your own naked eyes because the HD camera allows you to see much more, close up and clearly, than the average person (even someone with great eyesight). The camera angles are as low as the forest floor and as high as the eagle flies.

The images of the eagles alone are worth watching the entire video by itself, in my opinion. I'm lucky enough to get to see a beautiful Bald Eagle several times a month as it soars through my back yard, and I guarantee there's nothing else like it, except maybe even better on this video due to the clarity and close ups the cameraman was able to get. But there's so much more to it; mountains of all shapes and sizes, the ocean, whales, birds and other animals, rivers, lakes, trees, waterfalls, green mossy nooks and crannies, fog and mist, glaciers, green hills and fields... all at their most beautiful, as if they're performing at their very best just for this movie.

If you're familiar with the area or not familiar with this area it's a must see, especially if you like the scenery from movies like The Hobbit or Avitar because the scenery is much the same. I live in the pacific northwest and the beautiful land is one of the reasons I do. Love it!

Regarding Amazon Verified Purchase: So you know my review is not bogus, most of my reviews are of items I buy from Amazon and can be proven with a notation in my reviews by Amazon that it is a ""verified"" Amazon purchase. But I purchased the downloadable version (not the DVD) from another site because it was not available for download here on Amazon at the time I wanted to buy it.",1385942400,10,2231,4.553615960099751
4217082,5,B003XKQ602,This is an AWESOME video. It is so relaxing and beautiful to watch. I put it on while I'm reading a book or just want to relax. The music is soothing and the visuals are beyond beautiful. I first saw it on PBS and had to buy it.,1385251200,3,228,3.7708333333333335
4217083,1,B003XKQ602,How many Blu-ray DVDs have you bought of nature that were not really HD but were just the old blurry resolution repackaged in a Blu-ray disk shell and called HD -- which should be punishable by a crime in my opinion because they are not. The views are good but the sharpness and quality of the visual picture are NOT HD in my view and it should somehow be a crime for people to market a product as HD or Blu-ray when it is not! Shame on them!!!,1383091200,2,444,4.056818181818182

4217086,5,B003XKQ602,Fantastic and awe inspiring from start to finish. Photography and soundtrack combine perfectly for a great experience for the senses! I also love the fact that 90% of it was filmed in Washington state! The Redwoods of California and the ice flows of Alaska round out this film perfectly!,1366675200,,287,4.877551020408164
4217087,2,B003XKQ602,"It doesn't matter what format you watch a video on if the film quality is extremely grainy and low resolution.
