2547835,5,B000F0V0KY,My daughter loves fashion and because I love this series I wanted to share it with her (she doesn't get BRAVO). I happened to be visiting her so we watched some episodes on the DVD together. I was surprised to find that there was extra material included in each episode.,1156291200,9,270,4.42
2547836,5,B000F0V0KY,"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet because I haven't been able to hook up my DVD player.  However, I'm sure I'm going to love it, as I watch each episode on Bravo at least 6 times during their first run, and then usually watch the recaps and marathons.",1154044800,2,258,3.9615384615384617
2547837,4,B000F0V0KY,"Why didn't anybody comment on this?  I read the Amazon reviews specifically to see if the television bleeps were still there in the DVD's, and nobody said anything about profanity, so I bought the DVD's, plugged them in, and holy smokes!

Finally somebody is going to offer up a warning, and that somebody is ME.

The episodes are bleeped as they were on TV, but if you let your kids watch the special features, be prepared to explain a lot of things.  The F-word is thrown around in all kinds of different ways (including Daniel V singing a song about wanting to F some magnatack, and Santino using it however he pleases).  They also mention seeing your dad master---ing and your parents having s-x.

And the real shame of it is, the special features are really lame.  They call it ""Outtakes and bloopers,"" but there's all this profanity and none of it is funny.  The special features disk includes what they call a ""catfight"" between Santino and Nina in the lingerie episode, but we saw the worst of it already on TV.  The rest of it (shown in the special features) is just the long, dull lead-up to the confrontation that we already saw.  The reason they cut it in the first place was that it was BORING.  What made them think it would be any less boring on DVD?

I love Project Runway and I'd give the show itself 5 stars, but the uncensored and unfunny special features bring the DVD package down a notch.  I would have given it 5 stars if they had just given us what was on TV.  The special features are without a doubt the weakest part of the DVD package.",1153094400,17,1562,4.397212543554007
2547838,5,B000F0V0KY,"While season 1 was great and compelling, season 2 trumps season 1. This gives you a real insider's view of what creating fashion is all about. You might quibble with some individual winners and losers, but in the last result the winner is truly the best of the lot. While I suppose you could have caught this all when originally broadcast or re-broadcast or indeed re-re-broadcast, the season is best watched in sequence. While my pick of the whole shebang is Santino's wonderful gown, showcased at the end of his runway show, Chloe's runway presentation is sensational.

All I could have wished for is a bit more follow-up on the winning and losing designers, and of course a coverage of Kara's own runway show (evidently, the final was filmed before the 3 finalists were chosen, but only the runway shows of those top 3 made it onto the air).

Obviously, I await season 3 with eager anticipation!",1152662400,15,898,4.713375796178344
2547839,4,B000F0V0KY,"My daughter introduced me to this show and although this isn't my usual topic to write about, I wanted to tell everybody who is interested in fashion to pick up this show.  It's basically about a group of 16 up and coming fashion designers who go through a series of tasks given to them by Elle magazine, Banana Republic where they have a certain amount of time to put together an item which is them viewed on a runway by celebrity judges such as Michael Kors.  (You try putting a gown together in 2 days)!  Each show, one person is illiminated until 3 are left for a full blown fashion show.  Just watching these talented designers putting together outfits in such a short period of time is amazing.  This show kept me glued to the TV.  You can rent it too.",1152403200,4,758,4.340425531914893
2547840,5,B000F0V0KY,"I was really hoping to find Project Jay on dvd. Thanks to oc bob, I got it from the TARGET Only edition. Go to Target. Its worth it.

Season Two equals, if not surpasses, Season one in creativity and drama.

The only flaw in the show is the weekly model selection. Every week, the winner of the last challenge chooses his last model or the losing designer's model. With one notable acception, the winning designer always goes back to his model. To shake things up and make it interresting, they should have a rule that the winning designer can't have the same model two times in a row.

Trump WISHES he was Heidi Klum!",1152230400,4,618,4.4035087719298245
2547841,5,B000F0V0KY,"The second season of Project Runway is definitely my favorite season. From the antics (and sometimes insane designs) of Santino, the wit of Nick, and watching Daniel V. go from being almost unseen in the first few episode to one of the best designers of the season, it's reality TV at its best.

The DVDs are loaded with extras. The best part of the DVDs, however, are the extensions added to the episodes. They range from as little as a new reaction shot to covering when the designers went for manicures and pedicures during the Makeover Challenge. Most of the bravotv.com bonus videos have been incorporated into the challenges they came from, and the rest are left under the Special Features.

All in all, this is one of the best DVD treatments I've seen for any television show, period.",1152057600,7,791,4.683453237410072
2547842,5,B000F0V0KY,"Does anyone really need a synopsis on Project Runway?  Have you been hiding under a red carpet?  Heidi Klum, (beautiful) 16 contestants (insane to in-sane-er), challenges (chaos), judges, the models, the celebrities...Hello?

I'm not sure if this season was better than last because as colorful as Santino was...""What happened to Andrae?  Oh, I know, he's at the Red Lobster with Tim.""...he didn't quite match the maniputlative, snipping witch that was Wendy Pepper!  On the other hand he designed and sang a hell of a lot better!  Will we ever forget his Daniel Franco tribute, which is deadly and extended on the DVD.
At least this season they got rid of the constant model switching which was annoying and made the one and only 'walk-off' a killer...Poor Nick!

Andrae's emotions really shine on the DVD and they're brilliant, brilliant, brilliant...I loved Andrae!

The DVD that Amazon is presenting is happily and heavily stuffed with extras...It's worth it just for Tim Gunn's Blog alone, but there is so much more.

As far as reality TV goes, this is what it's about...It's not silly and it doesn't dumb down its viewers.",1152057600,19,1128,4.957446808510638
2547843,5,B000F0V0KY,"Project Runway is hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum. Although she is pregnant for this season, she is beautiful and sports highly fashionable outfits. The object of the show is to find a designer and award him or her an opportunity to begin a clothing line. With various challenges ranging from the traditional (making a gown for a celebrity like Nikki Hilton or Sasha Cohen) to the absurd (making an outfit from the clothes off your back or with plants), the judges rate each designer and vote one off each week.

This season features a colorful cast ranging from the sophisticated Nick, the youthful Chloe, the outrageous Santino, and the emotional Andre. Also, we get to see all the hilarious moments again like Santino immiating their task giver and making up stories about him. This is certainly a show that no one interested in fashion should skip.

Bravo runs the season in marathons frequently, but why wait for them to tell you when to watch the show? Make your own hours with this great DVD.",1151452800,6,999,4.735632183908046

If you want to watch more though, I did a search, and found a website that sells all the DVDs for Seasons 1 through 12. I don't remember the website, I'm sorry. But if you do a search, you will find it. Season 13 isn't on DVD yet, and Season 14 just ended. The seasons 1 through 12 came in a big box, with the DVDs in little case covers, not DVD covers. They were also made in Japan or Korea and have some flaws. All in all though, I love them, and found that buying seasons 1 through 12 in one product was much cheaper than buying each season separately. About $100 I think.",1448323200,,687,4.0588235294117645

2547940,5,B000F0V0KY,"I don't sew, but I adore this show!

Each season begins with approximately 12-16 up-and-coming fashion designers selected to compete for the opportunity to design a show for Fashion Week in Bryant Park of New York City.  Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints.  The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).

In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show.  The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!""  And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques.  And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.

But at the core of it all is the fashion.  It is really interesting to watch the clothes come to life in each challenge, culminating in a runway show.

As I'm a fan of some reality tv I decided that the price was cheap enough to take a gamble and bought it. I ended up liking this so much I promptly bought all the other seasons that were available at the time, (seasons 1 to 6). After watching all of them I've decided that season 2 is my favourite. The characters on this season seem alot more interesting that in any other season. You get evil ones, funny ones, moany ones and nice ones. There is plenty of drama, with one contestant breaking down on the runway while being interrogated by the judges. Seasons 1 - 4 are very good, seasons 5 and 6 are only average with less interesting contestants. If you are looking for something new to watch, give this season a go.

2547948,5,B000F0V0KY,"My Favorite Season of One Of My Favorite Shows!

I remember when this show first came out & tons of people that weren't really into fashion, or could barely dress without having a real fashionista yell fashion victim say that they were really into this. Me being the slave to fashion that i am just never got around to watching the show.

I found myself at Staples the other day buying some pens, when i came across an eight dollar DVD rack at the register. I found myself glued to a bargain, but had no intention of getting anything else buy pens that day. Needless to say i was rummaging and found Project Runway season two in the pile of sorted DVDs and decided to examine it thoroughly before finally making a choice. I had to make sure it was a very long show, had enough episodes, and had decent extras before i finally decided to purchase the season two set.

This is my favorite season and it's the awesome cast that really makes it a stand out, knock out, special season. There was crazy Andrae with his insane gestures, Santino with his crazy over the top jokes including a dead on impersonation of Tim Gunn, down to earth genuine cutie pie Nick Verreos who really should have been in the top three, and Zelema Griffin who turned up the heat when she said to Kara: ""You can cry, but you have to sew and cry."" And let's not forget when she decided to get fierce and had a fashion model walk off in episode eight.

I am so hooked on this show that i ran out for all the other season though i was a bit disappointed in season three. Please pick up this DVD and watch the show everyone's been talking about. Great season, great cast, great extras.",1255305600,,1653,4.32258064516129
2547949,5,B000F0V0KY,"PROJECT RUNWAY is above and beyond my very favorite reality show.  The way it is filmed and produced is so impressive.  The shows gets truly talented designers as contestants, the judges are true infamous people in the fashion industry and Heidi Klum is a very intelligent and articulate host who is just as knowledgable on the fashion as the judges.  And the biggest star is Tim Gunn, the kind of mentor we all wish we had.  He is the true heart of the show as he shares his wisdom and guidance on each garment being made.

Season 1 became a huge hit and season 2 came on at an even more entertaining level.  The caliber and diversity of the designers is immense.  Also the personalities were a perfect mix for some real fun back stage drama.  My favorite has always been Daniel V but we also have Santino, Andre, Diana, Chloe and Nick.  The challenges are imaginative and lots of fun.  This dvd set is a must have for there are truly extended episodes with added never before seen footage.  There are is also a ton of extras on this season.  Bloopers and extended footage of the shows highlights.  The WEAR ARE THEY NOW segments are also very informative.

I must comment on the review that stated it was all staged and that the judges don't actually make the decision on who is eliminated.  Reviews here are meant for personal opinions.  We may not agree with others but all have a right to voice their opinions.  But stating facts incorrectly just infuriates me.  The print at the end of the show cleary states that the judges consider the opinions of the producers and the network Bravo as well when making the elimination decision.  But they are ultimately the final voice.  This makes perfect sense and is perfectly acceptable.  Michael Kors is a world renowned designer and Nina Garcia is huge in the fashion industry.  There are also guest judges such as Vera Wang.  These people are all of the highest caliber and the show is first rate.  None of these people would participate on something that was not truly on the up and up.  This show is a hugely enjoyable foundation that honestly judges the contestants fashion.  It just upsets me that this misinformation could keep someone from  watching the show.

If you have never seen this show you must give it a try.  It will suck you in and you will become a fashionista more than you ever imagined.  I can watch thes seasons over and over.
Every season is intelligent, truly based on the creations of talented designers and the show builds to fashion week when the final 3 get to showcase their line.  Such fun and such talent.",1254614400,2,2586,4.544468546637744

2547957,5,B000F0V0KY,"This show really captured my attention the first time I caught it on TV; so much so that I bought all of the seasons that were available (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Project-Runway-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000ATQYSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Project Runway - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Project-Runway-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000UNYJT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Project Runway - The Complete Third Season</a>). Season 2 is basically the same format as its predecessor. Heidi Klum & Tim Gunn are back on board as hostess and advisor, respectively. The show begins with 16 designer hopefuls and narrows down to the final 3 who get to execute a complete line of designs for NYC Fashion Week. As before, what I enjoyed the most was the creativity. This season, watch the designers create a dress manufactured completely out of plants, lingerie for Heidi, an evening gown for model superstar Iman (to be worn on the red carpet at an event), an outfit for My Scene Barbie, and an outfit for Olympic skating silver medalist Sasha Cohen. There are other challenges as well through the season.

It is extremely interesting to hear what the judges have to say about each designer and their creations. Michael Kors & Nina Garcia (Elle Magazine) are back again giving their sometimes cutting but accurate critiques. This season, the designers are much more vocal and sometimes talk back with disrespect to the judges (would you dare to question or sass back at Diane von Furstenberg?!?). The designers are not quite as loveable as the first season, but there are still many ""characters"" which are interesting to watch, most notably Santino Rice, the insensitive loudmouth and sometime ""villain"" of season 2. Debra Messing of ""Will & Grace"" joins the judges for the NYC Fashion Week critique of the Final 3.

Extras on the 4 DVD set include: outtakes & bloopers (do we really need to see Andr's crying scene unedited or Santino verbally sparring with Nina?), WEAR Are They Now (for the Final 3 contestants only), Cast Audition Tapes, Tim Gunn's Blog (which is an interesting episode-by-episode blog of Gunn's thoughts), and an Exclusive Season 3 Casting Call shot at LA's Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel. Naturally, this particular featurette focuses on the freakier contestants!

Overall, another great set that will test your creativity and increase your fashion knowledge!",1218931200,3,2520,5.768817204301075
2547958,4,B000F0V0KY,This is such a great show.  It's strangely addicting.  I find myself looking at fashion and actually caring what I wear.,1218412800,,120,4.666666666666667
2547959,4,B000F0V0KY,"""Project Runway"" is high-quality reality TV. This sounds like an oxymoron, I know, but it's true: this is a show where the results are based on talent, and on the contestant's ability to function in the real world of fashion. The demands made on them are extreme, but realistic, and winners rise or fall based on their actual ability, not on any of the flawed metrics of other reality shows (audience polls, political maneuvering by other contestants, etc.) It is a compelling, watchable show, packed with knowledgeable, helpful and unyielding judges, and a host of flawed, talented participants.

Season Two finds the show's format being tinkered with and perfected -- the staging and editing are slicker, and some interesting twists are added to the strategic end of the elimination process. That being said, the pool of contestants is less compelling than in the rawer Season One, and their work is also less striking. Where the premiere season had several amazing designers with strong personal aesthetics, Season Two is marked by mundane, seat-of-the-pants design work. Other than the unlikeable, egotistical Santino Rice (who turns out to be more sympathetic towards the end) few of the designers seems to have a cohesive creative vision, and for weeks on end only a scarce handful of striking outfits appear. (This is pointed out by the show's major domo, Tim Gunn, when the talent pool is whittled down to six: he bluntly tells them that their work has been dull, and to kick it into gear.)

On the other hand, the interpersonal dynamic between the designers, which takes a long time to gel, is ultimately fascinating. Most of the contestants are actually rather nice people, and other than in small, selfish moments, they are emotionally and materially supportive of each other, even helping a flustered friend finish some stitching when the clock starts to run out. This is something you don't often see in the back-biting world of ""reality"" games shows: humanity. And in many ways, it made the final elimination rounds much more poignant, since by and large, the most talented, most likable contestants were the ones left onscreen.

While no Jay or Austin emerged from this season, it was still pretty fun. I'm hooked.",1217635200,,2229,5.002695417789758
2547960,3,B000F0V0KY,"Having gone through the first season before, the 2nd season although still nice, it is not as good as the first one.  The talents and personalities of the contestants did contribute greatly to what the audience felt about the show.  Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn are just as marvellous.  But one did not feel so much attached to the contestants of the second season.  But it is only fair to say that any episode which follows a wonderful first will be much more difficult to shine through.",1212192000,,483,4.517241379310345

You get the feeling that someone is always put in to cause controversary. This is the only season I own - didn't like the winner at all - but I just like having them.  I don't understand why this season is cheaper than the others. That's why I haven't bought them yet. I will admit that my favorite season of all has been season four which is not out at this writing.  It's the first time, there wasn't such fighting and clawing. For the most part, the designers did get along and seem to like and care about each other. It's a good show.",1207440000,,699,4.087591240875913

Of course, watching extending coverage of Santino is a delicious treat and just that alone is worth buying the DVD.  For fashionistas and those who enjoy their reality TV (yeah right) with a dose of real talent this is the show! The fact that they are judged on something that they actually had to create vs. a challenge won of circumstance makes this engrossing and Tim's obvious affection for this group was apparent when SantinoTim was ""outed"".

Santino's impersonations of Tim Gunn are hysterical:  Make it work, make it work, make it work...

The problem is that over here I'm exposed to so much crappy reality TV I start to feel like my Year long education is being reversed by media attempts to dumb down society.

When a friend suggested I buy this for my wife(Who loves fashion)I cringed ( living in Germany you sort of get Heide Klum over exposure).After asking a female friend from the states her opinion I bought it. I was pleasantly surprised. Heide Klum's part was limited to introducing the show and the set of characters competing to be the next new big thing were so Gay,Arrogant,Pathetic,loathsome,loveable that I was enthralled. I watched the whole thing through from start to finish and loved most of it. I give it four stars because it dragged on a little in one or two shows.

2547991,5,B000F0V0KY,"yes, project runway is a guilty pleasure, very much like eating triple decker chocolate pie and bobbing your head to justin timberlake. Still, it's entertaining, and the fact that it's based on designers who have to prove their talent makes it a pretty worthwhile show to watch. These designers have to rely on their creativity, resourcefulness, and industriousness in order to climb up to the winner's circle (aka. New York Fashion Week)

A lot of people compare Project Runway to America's Next Top Model, but i have to say that they are NOTHING alike. Project Runway requires actual TALENT, talent that is tried and tested every week. Where America's Next Top Model contestants are judged on the basis of how catlike they walk and how appropriately they can contort their facial muscles, Project Runway is a show that celebrates creativity and pushes contestants to demand nothing short of perfection.

Also, it helps that Season 2 is jam-packed with super charismatic contestants who are pretty loveable and intelligent. Really, a reality show is made up of the characters, and Season 2 will not disappoint. There's a well of cattiness a la judge talk-backs, musical interludes (that are actually pretty good!)and even some pretty personal confessions.

2547992,5,B000F0V0KY,"I haven't been so transfixed by a series in a long time.  This reality show is akin to an epic drama.  What drives it is that centers around the act of artistic creation from start to finish.  The contestants are designers hoping to make it to show their design collection at New York's Fashion Week.  They're given a different challenge at the beginning of each episode, and each episode culminates in the fashion show in which one contestant is proclaimed a winner, and one contestant ""will be out.""  This particular season boasted an incredible cast of unforgettable characters.  Heidi Klum is excellent as host and judge, Tim Gunn is perfect as mentor, Nina Garcia and Michael Kors know their fashion.  Project Runway is filled with creativity, beauty, and drama.

With Santino' great pipes ""Daniel Franco where did you Go"" is a sure hit, as is Santino and Andre's duet ""Don't let Emmit on the serger.""

Lots of fabulous quotes and everybody's audition tapes (Daniel Vosovic's is the best) are a must see bonus feature.
