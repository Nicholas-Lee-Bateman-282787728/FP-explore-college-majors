8428173,5,B004FPE46M,"Regarding Part 1 of 3 parts: It's good to see a telling of the story of Jesus that includes historical facts and the historical context in which he began his ministry. This is not one of those dramatizations of stories from the Bible, but the historical information about the times leading up to his appearance, the inclusion of information more recently discovered that indicates how the writers of the Gospels might have tweaked the facts to match the prophesies of the Old Testament, and the early Church Founders who tweaked/added/removed passages to insure more followers. This documentary covers what is known about the times before, during and after his ministry, about the early development of a following that formed around his teachings and how it grew--with the help of specific historical figures who were in a position of power, and select stories that confirmed he was the Son of God--into one of the most followed religions in the history of Humankind. I wish they had sold the discs separately. I'm not that interested in parts 2 & 3, but I will watch them.",1325894400,2,1073,4.868852459016393
