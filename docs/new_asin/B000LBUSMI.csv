Asterix is a Gaul who lived in Roman times.  His adventures have taken him to Rome, Scandinavia, and Egypt, but things are switched up as he voyages to the ""new world.""
There are clever things here.  When Asterix smokes a pipe, he says, ""Hopefully, this will never catch on.""  The Gauls refer to a turkey as ""gobble gobble.""  The main character says ""up doodoo creek"" and as this was translated for British audiences, I didn't know that slang phrase was used over there.
There is some messy stuff, however.  I'm an African American and I didn't like how a Black character had exaggerated lips and was clearly influenced my minstrelsy.  They show the Romans as stereotypical Italians, talking about pizza, etc.  If Gauls came to North America, they probably would have met Northeastern tribes.  Here, there are tipis, which are from the Plains, and totem poles which are from the Northwest.  They just threw Native American stuff together really haphazardly.  Then again, Asterix and the Natives sing a song, ""We Are All the Same Tribe,"" that clearly was a promotion of multiculturism or liberal humanism.
For a silly cartoon, this was okay.  I'd much rather watch this than ""Muppet Babies.""  It's not as sharp as a ""Toy Story"" or ""Ice Age,"" but I'd think minors would like it.",1284940800,3,1407,4.8125

For those not in the know, the big A has been translated into everything, and can be found everywhere. Except America, apparently! I was shocked to discover that the Movies had almost been completely absent from the American market. Based on that realization, it seems unlikely that anyone is even going to read this review! Nonetheless, here it is!

  This Movie is loosely based on Asterix and the Great Crossing. I forget where the other elements come from. The premise, which takes a while to establish, is that the Romans have kidnapped Getty, and are zipping off across the sea with him in tow. It's up to A&O to pursue, and rescue that vital member of their tribe. Eventually they end up in America, and spend a fair amount of time with some real red-skins! Interaction includes thwarting a sinister Medicine Man, dancing around, and trying to avoid a Native Woman! Hijinks galore!

  The animation is mostly quite good, especially the indians.
  The voice overs leave something to be desired though. I never quite imagined A&O speaking with such weird British Accents. British market I guess. But still... definitely takes some getting used to.
Overall, this product is appropriate for pre-teens, or post-teens who may be fans! Of course, the Romans are given the short schrift, so beware!",1207699200,20,1382,4.901287553648069
