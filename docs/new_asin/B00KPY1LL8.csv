8660662,3,B00KPY1LL8,Kind of English version of Ghost Adventures. The British medium leads the castle owner a bought and she tells him the history after the visions of the ghost and then they have some weird evps and stuff afterwards but the best thing is getting to see a Real Medieval Castle and how it's constructed and all. Overall it's worth the price charged I believe.,1408924800,,354,4.546875
