7898786,5,6305858020,"I LOVE this series, it's better than any soap opera I've ever seen.  The only pain was that it was so long and I had to wait forever for all the tapes to come out.  It's romantic, dramatic, sweet, and very imaginative.  The artwork is beautiful and it has a wonderful plot.  It's probably more attractive to women though, but there is plenty of action with martial arts and magic.  I only wish we could get more of this type of animation in the US.",971395200,3,448,4.223529411764706
7898787,5,6305858020,"Finally!  After two or three borderline volumes, Fushigi Yugi again captures the magic and mystery of the first season.  The implications of  the cryptic ""Universe of the Four Gods"" begin to crash down  around all the characters -- and just as suddenly we viewers begin to  question whether what we see is ""reality"", or just a story... in  a story... in a story.  We see the depths of Nakago's duplicity, Yui's  spite, Hotohori's loyalty, and Miaka's...well, stomach, I suppose.  And  what ""is"" Tamahome?  Enough uncertainty to make the last four  episodes worth anticipating!",965088000,8,576,5.075268817204301
7898788,5,6305858020,"Fushigi Yugi, aka The Mysterious Play, is one of the best shoujo aniem series I have ever seen.  It had me hooked from episode one. This volume of Fushigi Yugi is nearing the end of the TV series!  Now it comes down to the  character's final choices.  What will happen to Miaka and Yui?  What will  happen to the seishi, especially Miaka's lover, Tamahome? This series  captured my heart from the first time that Miaka and her best friend, Yui  first opened the Universe of the Four Gods in the library.  Fushigi Yugi  definetly is on my list of ""favorite anime series.""  If you  choose to watch this, I can guarantee you that you'll love it just as much  as I did.  ^_~",961459200,3,670,4.341463414634147
7898789,5,6305858020,Tamahome is in Miaka's world and a battle is raging in the Konan Empire.  Yui realizes her second wish wasn't what she hoped it would be. The  episodes in this tape are increadibly sad. This is definattly a tape to  buy. I don't want to spoil it but be prepared to say goodbye to some very  special Suzaku Senshi.,960681600,,313,4.254237288135593
