13 years after Nam, I had an option like the Col.  From hell on earth, everything changed for me.  I do not wish to say too much as it will ruin the story for some and needs to be watched for oneself.  The change is evident, completely and like the Colonel, I took the same path.

5584122,1,B00BEHOEX2,"I only made it about halfway through this thing before the mental illness was just too much for me to stomach any longer.  ANYone who believes that killing and war is something to enjoy and it's ok that I die bcz I'm doing something that I enjoy (direct quote about his own brother's death) needs serious mental help. The far-reaching scope of this piece of Americana is one I am thankful to not be a part of, yet horrified to know that these are my countrymen and women. The women who boast about the handsomeness of their husbands, uncles, and fathers perhaps should find something more important in life to focus on when describing an ideal partner. I actually wanted to watch this. I love stories of our military men and women, their bravery and sacrifice have always been near and dear to my heart, even if their politics are not. I could not, in good conscience, watch another second of these poor brainwashed people love war and it's destruction.  ""Thank God he was incinerated and didn't feel a thing.""  I don't know about you, but I would like to think that God would have preferred no war.  God had nothing to do with incinerating that man.  smdh",1508544000,3,1156,4.538461538461538

5584128,1,B00BEHOEX2,"Mistakenly thought it was historical battle story. 25 min into it, we are subjected to a stereotype of an outrageously dumb and ignorant war robot, who flunked school, wasn't good for nothing but war, and never bothered to learn the truth about wars he participated in, telling us (the more educated than him) his BS theories about the big picture of the war, a big picture he never bothered to question.

Having been years in military service, I always believed there are two types of war heroes - those who are smart, who know how bad war is, but come in prepared. They are not afraid because they are prepared and capable. Now the other kind - are those who are arrogant and clueless - dumb enough to think they are invincible, trust god, or think little of their enemies. Sorry to say, this guy is type II. Brave because he was Clueless (and still is).

On a side note Walter Cronkite is a disgrace who helped to destroy the image of our troops during this war. May GOD bless the men and women of our military past , present and future and let everyone who watches this movie understand the sacrifices made by all of them and their families.

5584134,1,B00BEHOEX2,"The film depicts what seems to be a likable man who describes ""his"" war; the battles and how he sees Viet Nam and its people.  We all have a story.
The film seems biased to me because he chose to omit, to this day, any opinion or information about the crime committed by Johnson by lying and deceiving in order to get into a war with Viet Nam.  He doesn't mention that this war lasted 16 years - back to the time of Kennedy.  We are living in a time where man has access to great intelligence and we are finally choosing to wake up to the Mafia mentality of government officials and greedy, power-hungry, self-centered leaders from the Pres. down.  I'm not interested in one more slave, holocaust, or war movie based on over-done, repeated ball and chain events.  I've moved on!  I haven't associated with people who choose to keep living in the past refusing to forgive or let go of what doesn't exist anymore except in the perpetual thoughts in the mind's of those who have never pushed on to what could be because they're neck deep into what used to be and recreate THAT over and over and over.

Fred left a young wife, Roselyn, and infant daughter to serve a second tour in Vietnam as a Cobra gunship pilot (he had been an infantry company commander his first tour); as the documentary described, he was killed when his Cobra was hit by ground fire.

His wife had told him when he left for deployment ""I am praying for you""  which he dismissed. The battle scenes are hauntingly frightening and the meeting, in the end, with his Viet Cong opposite was very moving. He views his survival as a miracle.",1483747200,3,459,4.440476190476191
5584169,1,B00BEHOEX2,"Although I appreciate the view of this movie, I do not agree with a lot of what is portrayed in it. The USA was not there to free anyone regardless of what is said. The Vietnam War was not about freedom it was about weapons and drugs. Agent Orange absolutely is the primary cause of birth defects in that region. My father was a Marine during the Vietnam war and I spoke extensively to him through out my life of the happenings, circumstances, the whys and causes of this war. He was a communications expert in a Recon Unit that were dropped behind enemy lines to assess enemy troop movement, identify Viet Cong strong holds, villages and operatives. During that time he was exposed to Agent Orange. In June of 2014 he died of Cancer caused by Agent Orange Exposure.  A lot of his comrades have either died, had their prostate removed or are currently battling cancer caused by Agent Orange.

 I feel this movie is propaganda and not the truth. US soldiers and the Vietnamese people themselves suffered great atrocities. A lot of Vietnam Vets I have spoken to tell me they did not know what they were fighting for, or the only thing they were fighting for was their buddy next to them, to keep them alive. It was not for freedom, it was not to stop communism. A lot of times the Veit cong would be installing SAM sites, with the help of a Russian counterpart. The F-100, F-85 Sabres  Fighters would ident these unfinished SAMS but were not allowed to  strafe them unless they were operational. There was so much so called politics to keep this war going because it was profitable. That's all I have to say. But others may like this documentary. I didn't",1483574400,6,1653,4.496666666666667

5584173,5,B00BEHOEX2,"Being a Vietnamese born and raised in Vietnam, I find this movie quite intriguing to hear the American perspective of the war. Personally, I find out that movie portrays the deeply ingrained feeling of the war that despite so much that has been done to heal and reconcile, there is still something lingering around.

The communists still need the museums and propaganda to further their legitimacy claim of the war - They cannot shoot on their mouth to say bad about themselves. The Vietnamese Colonel in the movie was not a simple private at the time of the battle; base on the ID shows in the movie, he was a Lieutenant, and he has raised far in ranks. He speaks from (what I feel) a not quite sincere reconciliation tone; the reason is that I knows that Vietnamese government could have done a lot more to reveal the truth about the war and actually fulfill the promised (freedom, justice, peace for the country) they made to the soldiers during that war, but the government, like a lot of governments, including US government as well, are not quite accountable for all their political choice.

Putting politics aside, I see the perspective of common soldiers who found for their life and for what they believe in. They must strongly believe that they were doing honorable work so that they could lay down their life in battle.

Nevertheless, the policians who made those wars should be help accountable - they should be the one out there to explain everything !

The Vietnamese colonel was right in one thing: they were bombarded during their retreat - a lot of NVA soldiers died and never have their bodies recovered nor their name even mentioned in record. Thus, don't be surprised that finding American MIA in Vietnam will take time. No body is holding this task back.",1482796800,10,1775,4.697749196141479

5584209,1,B00BEHOEX2,"What impressed me the most about this ""documentary"" is the unending drivel of American propaganda, and the brainwash of the participants on both sides 40 years later. From America's side: the claim that the Viet Cong were fighting because of coercion from the top, not patriotism; the claim that America was fighting for the ""freedom"" of the Vietnamese; the claim that Mai Lai was an isolated incident, as was damage (direct and genetic) by napalm. And so on and so forth. I lasted no more than 30 minutes. A shameful rehashing of America's role, and the harm it caused to the lives of millions.",1473724800,6,595,4.730769230769231

There is little that I find heroic about the war and I can totally understand why the Vietnamese people feel the way they do. At the time I really had a misconstrued idea of what the war was about. Since returning and given time to research our involvement I have a totally different perspective.
This type of movie is just not my favorite. I would not make a judgement for others, as they may find it to be interesting. I for one am a bit sickened that the N. Vietnamese now give tours of downed US planes, tunnels used by the Viet Cong and the many different types of traps that were designed to maim and injure US soldiers.

The viewers find themselves being taken back and forth between the past and the present without the movement becoming distracting or confusing. I appreciated the care and skill in the directing and the editing, as well - it is visually artistic.

We had several Vietnam veterans present with us when we watched it. They were deeply moved by it; we were privileged to hear their own stories, which were drawn out by the movie. For those of us a generation (or more) removed from Vietnam, it is a helpful bridge to the conflict.

5584336,5,B00BEHOEX2,"Another reviewer summarized the film. I'll focus on whether or not you should buy this DVD.
It is a documentary. There are no Hollywood special effects or fakery. The story presented is true. Below are the reasons why I love this movie.

1) It is a true story, not 'based on a true story'. You follow the real Paul Longrear and his family and the film crew as they return to Viet Nam to the scene of the most significant battle of Longrear's life.

2) Viet Namese nationals are interviewed in Viet Nam. One of them is a Col from the North Viet Namese Army who also fought in the same battle. The inclusion of these interviews add tremendous depth to the film.

3) There's no attempt to manipulate the audience or the story. This is straight-up reporting and recording the interactions between Longrear and other real people.

4)The film does an outstanding job of connecting Longrear's experience during that battle to his life today.

Who should buy this film? Anyone with an interest in military history, or an interest in biographies. I am happy that I have a copy in my collection.",1374537600,25,1085,4.601036269430052

8566978,4,B00BEHOEX2,"The Yards, as they were known in GI Slang, was short for Montagnard. The latter term was what the French called them, which means the people of the mountains. According to Wikipedia, the preferred name today is Degar, a term I had never heard of before. I had thought that the real name was moi, but that too carried negative connotations.

There are numerous other subgroups, such as the Muong and Tay. These peoples are the original settlers in the area of Indochina, before the arrival of the Vietnamese and Khmers. They had originally settled in the lowlands, but the latter groups effectively pushed them into the highlands.

Paul A. Longrear was born in 1943, in Cairo, Ill. His father abandoned the family at an early age; he would have problems with a number of subsequent stepfathers. He admits to being a trouble maker. He even associated with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. He joined the Army for the disciplined life and became a Greet Beret stationed at Ft. Bragg. He arrived in Danang on November 12, 1967 and was soon commander of a company of Yards, at Lang Vei, tucked into the very northwest corner of what was once South Vietnam. Lang Vei was a small base composed of approximately 25 Green Berets and several hundred Yards, located seven miles west of Khe Sanh, and 1500 meters east of the Laotian border. This movie is his story, which encompasses the Battle for Lang Vei, commencing on February 06, 1968, as well as Longrear's return to Vietnam and the battlefield in 2011.

The battle was the first time the PAVN utilized tanks in the war against positions manned by Americans. They were the lighter PT-76 tanks and not the heavier T-54s, one of which famously crashed through the gate of the Presidential palace seven years later. Parts of this movie involve the reading of the radio transcripts at the time as transmitted from Lang Vei, including the subject quote. I felt the reading was far too calm! Heightened inflections and profanities were omitted, as one must imagine what it was like to be one of 24 Americans against three infantry battalions, two sapper companies and two tank companies. The base was completely overrun, with a tank literally sitting on the concrete command post, where Longrear and his fellow soldiers were. PAVN soldiers poured gasoline into the command post and tried to ignite it with white phosphorous grenades. Even in the re-enactment of the story, it is hard to believe, or determine how Longrear survived. The fog of war seemed to be operative, along with the pullback of the PAVN to avoid American airstrikes. Though the commander at Khe Sanh at one time told them they were on their own, they would eventually be evacuated by helicopters and a small reaction force.

There was much about the return visit to Vietnam that I found grating. Longrear says that he still hates the evil that is the oppressive communist regime, and blames it for the poverty that he still sees. In the war crimes museum he says that My Lai was an isolated incident.  Interspersed are snippets that indicate he went back to Vietnam as a company commander, based out of Chu Lai, but omits the fact that he was in the ill-fated Americal Division, of My Lai infamy. He also discusses the death of his wifes brother, who was a Cobra gunship pilot. He and his family arrive again at Lang Vei, where there is a PT-76 tank memorial, and shake hands with one of the Vietnamese PAVN participants in the battle. The remains of the medic, Moreland, are eventually found and brought home in 2011, for a full-honors burial, including flyover.

Longrear received a head wound at Lang Vei. He credits god with saving his life and says that he saw him there. Subsequently he would become a preacher and dedicate his life to god. He and some family members admit that there is skepticism about this portion of his story.

This was an important movie for me to watch. Such is the fog of war that the second time that the PAVN committed tanks in a battle against an American base, on March 04, 1969, at Ben Het, the vast majority of the American participants, if not all of them, felt this was the first time that tanks were used. Ben Het was a tougher nut to crack and was not overrun.

Despite my disagreements with Longrear on the war and the aftermath, this movie is an important augmentation of the record concerning the use of tanks in the Vietnam War. Overall, 4-stars.",1528070400,,4843,4.986386138613861
