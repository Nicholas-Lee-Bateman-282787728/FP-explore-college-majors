8512298,3,B0078A4R3Q,I've seen Mark' s show on multiple occasions both at conventions and at Harvey's comedy club in Portland and have loved his shows that's why almost $30. A CD was ok. Thou they cut out a lot of his show and in our opinion it really didn't work well with chunks missing. He's amazing but the DVD' s are not. Wouldn't purchase another cut DVD.  His shows are amazing not the same on these discs. They cut the guts out of his show.,1428969600,5,427,4.144578313253012
