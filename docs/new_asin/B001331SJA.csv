8248898,5,B001331SJA,"Recently picked up this VHS concert.  I give top marks for the quality of the picture and the audio.  I saw them on this concert tour in 1985, which is when this was filmed.  As with much of the early CCM (Christian Contemporary Music) concert videos are quite scarce.  I was very blessed to find this tape.  Many people scoff when you say you watch a VHS tape, as if you're stuck in the past.  This is one of thousands of concerts, as well as movies, that have not been released on DVD or Blu-ray and probably will not be.  If you like Mylon & Broken Heart you will love this concert.  The music and their '80's outfits may be dated by time but the message of the music is timeless.  Jesus Christ is the way!",1367107200,3,709,4.154411764705882
