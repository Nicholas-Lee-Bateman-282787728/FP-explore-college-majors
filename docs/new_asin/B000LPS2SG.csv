8274294,4,B000LPS2SG,"If you like pretty airheads with perfect bodies, too much razor, and tramp stamps, then this video is for you. There are some real girls in this video in the bonus section. They weren't fake enough for the main viewing.

There is an over abundant of camera man commentary in this video as the women couldn't hold a conversation as silicon impedes the mental capacities. Inadvertently the video makes a sad statement of our time. While a young girl is in a ""gyno"" position we hear her say she did the interview so people could see ""more of the real me."" Meanwhile the camera man is commenting on how beautiful her eyes are. Has society just ran out of ideas?

Like all Playboy videos, as long as my pause and zoom buttons work, it gets 4 stars.",1277510400,,743,4.416058394160584

8274296,1,B000LPS2SG,"Almost all of these women are fake.  Some beautiful faces and other features ruined by implants (as well as tattoos, piercings, ...).  One natural beauty in the extras.  (The Wal-Mart collection was almost all good; the McDonald's was half worthwhile.)  Recommended only for those who like plastic.",1181520000,6,298,5.276595744680851
8274297,4,B000LPS2SG,I had to turn the sound off after listening to these airheads after awhile. I mean even by [...] standards these girls were blowing in the wind. I also don't think them typical of my space but out for an investment in the dudes so to speak like a lot of enterprising young women these days.,1180224000,4,290,4.196428571428571
