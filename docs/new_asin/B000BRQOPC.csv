8091635,3,B000BRQOPC,"Pretty color and some good shots, esp of W. Hamilton. But I wouldn't vote for an acad. award.",1464998400,,93,4.222222222222222
8091636,3,B000BRQOPC,not bad at all. It was well written and the plot was good. I thought Wendy Hamilton did a nice job with this novel.,1380067200,,115,3.8333333333333335
8091637,5,B000BRQOPC,"watching this film makes me feel like i'm seeing wendy hamilton, the topless painter from ski school 2 .it feels like i'm undressing her , touching her small soft bum, feeling her large soft breasts ...",1370822400,2,202,4.638888888888889
8091638,2,B000BRQOPC,"The storyline was very very simple.  The interplay of the two principals
seemed too staged, and did not add interest to the storyline.",1366934400,,134,4.826086956521739
8091639,4,B000BRQOPC,"Typically thick-headed soft core fare,with a dopey script revolving around affairs and a murder mystery to which the beautiful leading lady(Playmate Wendy Hamilton) is accused.

Harmless enough time-waster,features some choice scenes with the busty,blue eyed brunette Ms. Hamilton as she engages in various sexual acts and a steamy shower as a guilty clothes designer.

What can I say?

The star is a total babe,and considering this is on the cheap,you could certainly do worse on a late Saturday night.

Enjoy.",1231459200,8,511,5.35
8091640,5,B000BRQOPC,I loved this movie. For you who loves t&a i can really recommend you to buy this one. Wendy Hamilton is always a treat and her in the main role is even better.,1228089600,5,159,3.8484848484848486
