Excellent material to learn how the lat, long coordinate system works.",1358035200,,108,4.45
8583769,5,B001E6TF8M,I bought this DVD to refresh my mind before teaching a Year 8 Geography class. When I first viewed the DVD I thought that because it was last published in 1979 it would be out of date.  I couldn't have been further from the truth. Yes it is a bit old but the explanation of Latitude and Longitude are excellent. Basic illustrations are used to demonstrate the concepts as they are explained. Would be absolutely perfect for school use.  In fact I think I may have seen the same show as a student only the one I saw would have been a movie.  Overall a great DVD which explains concepts very well- a well chosen purchase.,1345939200,,619,4.318965517241379
