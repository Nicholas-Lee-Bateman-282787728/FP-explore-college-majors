From the label:
""David Getoff is a traditional Naturopathic Doctor with a full time health and wellness practice in San Diego, California.  In 1994, David designed and began to teach a unique comprehensive health class to teach all aspects of gaining and maintaining true health throughout life. He has given presentations to large groups of medical professionals as well as to the general public, school teachers, students and number special interest groups.""

I was fortunate to be able to borrow this from my library; Dave explains more about the organic food industry and government standards concerning organic food production.  He also tells us how better food affects our health and why in the long run, organic food is cheaper than conventional, from his experience as a natural Dr. A good film to have the family watch or home schoolers to help balance some of the food industry advertisements that push empty calorie foods over nutrition. I recommend watching this in conjunction with Food, Inc, Food Matters, King Corn, GMO Trilogy/Seeds of Deception and The Future of Food.",1275004800,4,1258,5.789189189189189
