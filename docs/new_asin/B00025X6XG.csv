8241476,5,B00025X6XG,I was in this movie and have fond memories of the filming. It's so bad it's good. Many many recognizable faces and some pretty big names in this low budget erotic thriller. Help make Cover Story a cult favorite and pass it on. Check it out and enjoy the horrible acting and awesomely bad choreographed action. I cannot recommend this film enough.,1403740800,,346,4.596774193548387
8241477,3,B00025X6XG,"To start with, this film has some interesting lighting.  It  was shot in St. Louis on a limited budget by a local film production company with a lot of spirit. The director was educated in film school in Los Angeles and has worked on many significant projects in many capacities and has a very good visual sense. The cast includes a veteran actor who worked on Spielberg films and also the lead actress, Tuesday Knight, was torched by Freddie or Jason. My understanding is that this tape did well in the Asian markets.",1062806400,,518,4.559139784946237
