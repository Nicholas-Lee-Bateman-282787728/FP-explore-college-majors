I bought this DVD because I wanted to have vidoes by the Spice Girls together and solo. Here's my review of their videos on this DVD:

Spice Girls - Stop: I love this song and this video a lot. It is so much fun. Makes you wish you were there to experience the former fun that was the Spice Girls. The lyrics and the harmonies of the song are fantastic. A nice tribute to the Sound of Motown days.

Geri Halliwell - Lift Me Up: I like this song. It is very relaxing. The beginning of the video shows that by her driving in a car in the country but then the video gets really silly with the introduction of those little aliens that stay the remainder of the video.

Melanie C. - Never Be The Same Again featuring Lisa'Left Eye'Lopez from TLC /

Melanie C. - Northern Star:

I don't necessarily understand the rhythm and lyrics to these songs by Melanie C. but I like her voice and the videos are really cool to watch. Really nice computer graphic enhancements.",1137196800,,1207,4.534562211981567
