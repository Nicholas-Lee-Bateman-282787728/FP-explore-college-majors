8187137,5,B000OY37G6,Very tough tape that just keeps you moving throughout the routines...when finished feel like I really had a hard exhausting workout and sweating. It's a great workout.,1487376000,2,167,5.222222222222222
8187138,2,B000OY37G6,"I concider myself an intermediate stepper, and this dvd made me work...work to figure out what was going on! after watching the warm-up and first step routine twice through, i almost got it. but after that i mostly just stood there trying to figure out what the hell was going on. having to rewind a dvd and watch it several times so you can just get the basics of what is going on; that is not how i like to work out. I know the first time you do a step dvd you are not going to get it the first time, but this was ridiculous! There is an older woman in the way back i tried to watch, but there was so much all over the place moves, i couldn't keep focused. I did not like that fact there was a lot of ""around the world"" moves, so when i turned back around, no mater what, i was off step and didn't know where i was going. there needed to be 3 max people in the video not 5. and one person closer to the front needed to be doing the lower intensity of the workout so i would have at least had a chance of knowing what to do, rather than stand there confused. not happy with my purchase of this dvd...what a waste of my money.",1302480000,3,1126,3.921397379912664
8187139,5,B000OY37G6,"This is a great step workout.  I've bought Christi Taylor's and love them but had to go over her ""move master"" segments a few times before catching on.  I'm intermediate to advanced and eventually caught on and enjoyed them.  This one does have advanced moves but is less ""dancey"" than Christi's, it's easier to get the moves down.  If you don't get it the first few times you can still move to the count and continue.  My feeling is that it's a more athletic step routine, and I did enjoy the hiphop music.  Music choices are important to me and these are motivational, you can't stop moving and the time flies by.  Also like the add-ons, abs and stretch.",1236038400,3,656,4.46218487394958
8187140,4,B000OY37G6,"I found this workout to be somewhat challanging at first but after a couple of weeks I got the moves down.  I love the music ""Don't Cha"" and ""Must Be The Money"" (I think those are the correct song titles??).  I highly recommend this video for anyone who wants a good sweat.",1235952000,2,273,4.230769230769231
8187141,1,B000OY37G6,"I heard great things about Gay Gasper and chose this video as my first ""at home"" step video.  Mistake!! I did not find her queing perfect - her feet were ahead of her commands most of the time!!  My biggest complaint is that the DVD says that they give ""multiple workout options"" but if you choose something other than the longest workout the workout is just chopped up bits (of the long workout) that don't flow together.  One combo will end with the screen fading away then you're into the next combo and offbeat from where you were a minute ago.  Hard to explain but this contiues through the entire workout.  You have to keep stopping to switch your lead after each combo.  Drives me nuts!!  Not a well done DVD.",1232928000,3,716,4.419847328244275
8187142,5,B000OY37G6,"This one gets 5 stars from me. While the intensity is more intermediate (although, if you're advanced, you know how to make it harder), the music makes up for it. It's absolutely awesome!! Everything from Will Smith to Pussycat Dolls and more. The atmosphere in this video is also very friendly and encouraging. If you're motivated by hit music and like stepping, this one is for you. When I start this workout I can't stop, it's addicting.",1228003200,2,440,4.7272727272727275
8187143,4,B000OY37G6,"Gay Gasper is one of my favorites.  I workout to her other DVD, Cardio Step Express, at least a couple times a week.

This DVD is great and will definitely be in my rotation.  She uses unique moves and combos and the time flies.  Her queing is always perfect (unlike some of my other DVDs).  The music is a BILLION times better than her first DVD (it's actual songs- hip hop type music).

Compared to her first DVD, I do find the workout a little easier which was disappointing.  It's a great workout- but in comparing it to her other DVD, I just don't think it's as hard.  That's why I did 4 stars instead of 5.

I do like that she does each combo a few times and then moves on- instead of adding a combo and then going through all of the combos from the top.  It made the time go by a little faster doing it this way.

As with her other DVD I love that when she breaks down a combo she makes the count the same as the finished combo so that once you know what's coming you can just move forward.  Makes for more enjoyable workout when you've seen the same DVD a million times.

Her cool down is much better- no more dance thing- it's a straight forward cool down with the step.

Gay Gasper remains my favorite Step instructor (at least on DVD) and I will continue to enjoy this new addition!",1207785600,8,1293,4.12
