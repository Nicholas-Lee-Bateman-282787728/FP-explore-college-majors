It is well drawn and while it does have a message, it isn't delivered in a heavy handed manner.  For those who avoid sub-titles, don't in this case.  They are clear and seldom get in the way of what you'll be watching.  I'd recommend it and would have rated it higher if it had eight to twelve episodes included.  There was ample story line left over to fill the gap.",1428364800,,456,4.078651685393258
8430057,4,B004I4SBKK,"Rikuo and his friend, Masaki, live in a future where androids serve humans and strict laws surround them. These 3 laws that androids must follow are for the benefit of their humans. When Rikuo discovers that his android, Sammy, has been going off on her own, he and Masaki try to follow her and walk into the Time of Eve cafe, where their morals are questioned. There's a cute little girl who thinks she's a cat, an old man who watches out for her, and a couple who are not who they seem. The rules of this cafe state that humans and androids will treat each other as equals.

We watch as the two friends try to sort out their views and accept androids, who just might actually be more human then they ever thought. Masaki's dad is trying to get rid of these secret establishments, and Masaki is trying to figure out if he should continue going to this illegal cafe, or try and shut it down. For the 1 hour and 46 minutes this film played, I laughed, smiled, teared up and fretted over the well being of our characters. Racism is a touchy subject but it was tastefully handled throughout the movie. While this idea is nothing original, it did present itself in a very enjoyable way, and I would gladly watch it again.

The animation is SUPERB, the voice actors did an amazing job, and it really made me think:) If you liked Patema Inverted, or any Ghibli film for that matter, you more than likely will enjoy Time of Eve. No fanservice, just a clean, mature story that makes you wish you were an innocent young child again:) Highly recommend!",1414713600,7,1542,4.4070175438596495
