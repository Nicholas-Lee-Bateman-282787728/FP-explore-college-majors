8062057,3,B0009JTRUG,"I saw this oldie in a theater back in the late 70's.  No Video or DVD back then.  It's a series of classic off-color jokes enacted by a bunch of struggling actors.  Some great looking girls, as I recall.  The theatre audience would totally erupt at each punchline, it was really a lot of fun.  If it was on DVD, I'd most certainly get it, and pass it along to other couples for a few late-night chuckles.  But who buys VHS these days?",1141430400,4,434,4.168674698795181
