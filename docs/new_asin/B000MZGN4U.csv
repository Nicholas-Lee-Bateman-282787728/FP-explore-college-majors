8173591,3,B000MZGN4U,"The restoration of artistic wall paintings in Tibet is compared to restoration of Renaissance paintings, but nothing is said about the Chinese takeover of Tibet, which includes the forced migration of Chinese citizens into Tibet and the military destruction of many Tibetan monasteries. In the meantime, the corporate sector of western countries including the US are welcoming the export of products made by slave labor in China. Companies like Wal-Mart insist that only products manufactured  in China can be sold in their stores, while their employees, known as Associates, are striking for decent wages and are told to go on welfare. The Obama administration is doing little or nothing to require that giant corporations, who own most politicians of both parties, be regulated if they are ignoring laws that require them to follow the laws passed by Congress. Chinese companies are even worse, with employees being treated as slaves.",1384819200,,936,5.281879194630872
8173592,4,B000MZGN4U,"Although I believe this documentary to be very important, I have rated it a bit lower as I recall viewing a more complete, two-hour version via YouTube. Nevertheless, as the Chinese takeover of Tibet AND Nepal (where this video was filmed) limit or prevent accurate information being disseminated to the West (hence the cutback to only 55 or so minutes), it is another one of the invaluable resources to the Tibetan culture, arts, and spiritual beliefs; also a terrific comparison to what was happening in Tibetan spiritual arts at the same time the West was experiencing its Renaissance, e.g., Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel, which appear to be about the same in terms of technique, means of expression, etc. I also recall seeing an article in the Communist Chinese news about this project which explicitly stated that ""they"" had completely financed this venture, replete with pictures of Chinese women hanging over the roof parapets; despite the undisputed fact this project was financed by the Western Himalayan Project - more Communist Chinese propaganda, which may have limited the scope of this video.",1384387200,2,1112,5.149171270718232

Take a journey just outside of Tibet and see world-class experts help in the restoration of amazing Buddhist images. You will learn about art conservation, Buddhist philosophy, as well as Tibetan architecture, culture and so much more. This is one of my favorite films and one I use in the college courses I teach.",1326067200,4,331,4.807017543859649

Nova traveled to Lo Manthang in Upper Mustang in 2000 and 2001 to follow British architect John Sanday and art conservator Rodolfo Lujan from Rome as they work with local townspeople to try and restore the abandoned Thubchen Gompa and its paintings. John: ""I began to realize how fantastic the wall paintings actually were. They are fifteenth century, they are priceless. These are masterpieces.""

The film opens with Lama Guru Gyaltsen, a Tibetan monk, traveling on horseback up the Kali Gandaki valley. He stops at a cave where deities are said to emanate from the walls, and attends a Buddhist festival to ward off evil forces. John leads the restoration of the Gompa roof, in the traditional way with wood, flat stones and mud. Rodolfo leads the restoration of the paintings using the same techinques as the Sistine Chapel. Lama Gyaltsen and the King are pleased with the restoration, but ask the conservators to go even further and fill in the gaps and cracks in the paintings.

This is an excellent film of the restoration of Tbubchen Gompa and its paintings. There is a flyover of Lo Manthang, showing the makeup of the village. The Pavol Barabas film Upper Mustang is a perfect companion to this video because it highlights the spectacular scenery and everyday life in Lo Manthang.",1254182400,7,1469,4.963414634146342
8173596,4,B000MZGN4U,"I used this product for a college-level class on Buddhist art. I found it very easy to follow with beautiful photography. It presents the issues involved in a well-balanced manner, allowing my students to make up their own minds. I recommend it to wrap-up discussion on Buddhist, or Indian, art history.",1235433600,5,303,4.96078431372549
8173597,2,B000MZGN4U,"This documentary was about restoring 500 year-old Asian wall paintings.  I would have loved to learn more about the art itself, not just or mainly about bringing it back to mint condition.  People who go to Home Depot may like this work more than people who go to museums.  People who watch Bob Villa reruns may like this more than people who watch art documentaries.

Historically, Westerners have stolen and destroyed religious art from other cultures.  I loved that this program featured an exchange that was a two-way street and promoted equality.  The local people had say in whether they wanted the Westerners to work on these paintings.  They also got to make edits or further suggestions near the end of the process.  The main restoring expert had a terrible, scraggly beard, but I think he purposely sported to hide his weak chin.  He reminded me of a phrase used to describe Steve Buscemi in ""Fargo.""  I was impressed that he learned some of the local people's language.

From what I hear Buddhism doesn't have angels and demons; but much Buddhist art does.  This documentary never goes into detail.  A Buddhist student at my high school said long earlobes are supposed to be a sign of long life and this documentary shows portrayals of Buddha with long, pierced ears.  However, his earlobes and their significance didn't come up here.  In brief, this work had a limited scope that may frustrate some viewers.",1178928000,7,1419,4.805785123966942
