8522381,5,B007W19WF4,"Big props to April Monique and Jimmyo Burril for creating and continuing this absolute blast of a web-series! Alternately shocking and hilarious, it's sort of an H.G. Lewis/Creepshow/Troma/Texas Chainsaw cocktail with a comic book-come-to-life look, and an edgy punk rock sensibility. All involved seem to be having a blast, and the fun bleeds onto the screen in nearly every stylish shot. Let's hope that the fun continues in some incarnation or another for a long time to come, as the team brings much-needed passion and charm to backyard-horror. Long live Sally!",1337472000,,565,5.21978021978022
8522382,4,B007W19WF4,"I got on the Sally train very, very late; like I had just enough time to watch season-1 of the Sally show on her website before it was taken off. Before that, I had watched the Sally movie after reading a little blrb about it in a well-known horror mag. After that, I positively devoured the rest of the FORBIDDEN PICTUERS smorgasbord, & season-2 of the Sally show was no different. This year; it brings all the blood, gore, guts'n'glory of season-1 back in spades, & adds a bit of extra flesh to ogle. It also adds a lot of drama & a few twists that I'm sure will make season-3 (fingers crossed) even crazier than THIS one. It's not quite for underage horror fans, but it is worth the wait. If you love buckets of blood, crude humor, & way better acting than what tinsel-town's been churning out lately, you were born to be in the FORBIDDEN FAMILY.",1337040000,,849,4.345911949685535
8522383,5,B007W19WF4,"By far the best thing put together in a long time.  With most low-budget productions you don't get that perfect all around feel. With limited money you get shorted on one or two aspects of what makes a good film.  With the Chainsaw Sally Show it's a perfect blend of acting, scripting, effects, camera work, and has a bad ass soundtrack, you couldn't ask for more.  It's one of those things you can tell a load of blood, sweat, and tears went into it.  Nothing was left untold, and no rock was left unturned.  Rules were bent, beaten, and broken, tied up and beaten some more.

Amazon only allows 5 stars but this is worth at the least 10.  Highly recommended for any horror fan!!!!",1337040000,,682,4.408
8522384,5,B007W19WF4,"Chainsaw Sally Season 2 is an absolute blast! The story is so cool, the F/X are fun and Sally is great! It's an awesome Do-It-Yourself film project...and the passion and love of the cast and crew come through in full force as you watch. You laugh, you'll cry, you might throw up in your mouth a bit. I luv me some Sally and you will too!",1337040000,,337,4.121212121212121
8522385,5,B007W19WF4,I've been a fan of Sally since the original movie and anxiously awaited each subsequent appearance from her and I've never been disappointed by it. Season 2 of the Chainsaw Sally Show in my opinion is the best yet. Its tight and works very well episode to episode. The comedy also works just as well as the action an the horror. Everyone involved should be commended for the all the incredible work that was put into this and I can't recommend it enough. I just hope we see a return of Sally at some point in the future.,1337040000,,520,4.316326530612245
8522386,5,B007W19WF4,"A spectacular sophomore season.  8 Very well crafted episodes from the Burrils twisted imagination and warped sense of humor.  If you haven't met Chainsaw Sally yet, this is your best opportunity.  Can't you hear it knocking?  Why don't you go open the Door before it runs away!  Look, look, there it goes!  Catch it before its too late!  What was I talking about?

One last word, I haven't had the chance to hear the commentary, but, knowing the maniacs who participated, it has to be delicious.",1334880000,,496,4.686046511627907
