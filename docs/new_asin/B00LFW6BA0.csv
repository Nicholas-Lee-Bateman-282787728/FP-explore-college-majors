Burn in hell, MOD!  I bought ""SouthLAnd"" season 2 as an MOD and the quality was horrible.  Never again!",1406505600,5,274,4.530612244897959
6482053,5,B00LFW6BA0,"""American Dad"" just keeps getting funnier and funnier! I rather enjoy how these animated series (with the exception of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Futurama"") are ""made on demand""... With the purplish CD-Rs... Don't get me wrong; I love that I can watch them over and over again. But we get short-changed on special features. And if they can do this for these series (including ""Bob's Burgers"" and ""The Cleveland Show""), why not for the remaining ""King Of The Hill"" seasons that have not yet seen the light of day on DVD?

6482055,5,B00LFW6BA0,"I have loved ""American Dad"" from its inception. This series has never gotten its full due as it has been forced to somewhat remain in the ""Family Guy's"" shadow. In my opinion Lois & Peter Griffin on ""Family Guy"" are selfish, unloving orifices. ""American Dad"" has Stan & Francine, who love ALL of their children. Each is flawed, but they love. Roger is the best animation character on television today. This show is so clever. I hope that TBS keeps this show running for more than just an additional season. Fox was stupid for dropping this.",1406073600,5,540,4.635416666666667

6482058,3,B00LFW6BA0,"The episodes are great and (thankfully) uncensored.  I knocked this down to 3 stars because these are DVD-R's (MOD - manufactured-on-demand).  While I don't have that big of a problem with the idea of MOD, this is a bare-bones set.  No extras, no commentaries, nothing.  MOD could be a good thing for obscure titles that may not sell a million copies, but this is ""American Dad"".  At least give us some extras.

I did buy this knowing it was MOD, but only because I had heard they were uncensored episodes.  If they weren't, I may have just bought them digitally.",1405468800,29,563,4.57

It IS American Dad. The funniest show on the air.
It DOES have Hayley singing.
The transfer is good, sound & picture nice & clear.
(But REMEMBER: this is write-on-demand, & can vary from one set to another, because of that!)
They are completely UNCENSORED.
But it is UTTERLY bare bones.
No fun extras here.

UPDATE--
WOO-HOO~!
AD Vol 10 is out!

6482060,3,B00LFW6BA0,"American Dad has slowly become odder as the seasons go on through its worked mostly i its favour, in season 9 or volume 9; we see things become odd enough that you don't know what to really think. It's still got classic American Dad episodes but their is some bizzare moments.

MOD, DVD-R's not really anyones cup of tea really, but face it, without them, their wouldnt be a dvd release of Season/Volume 9 of American Dad. Yes, its quality is lower than it should be, yes special features are nowhere to be seen, but at least you have a dvd set of Season 9. And because FOX is no longer showing any new American Dads; this will be the new normal for American Dad. So if you don't like it, get the digital versions of each epiosde.

It's mostly the same American Dad just on a different DVD format. For better or worse? You decide!",1404432000,4,830,4.314102564102564

6482077,1,B00LFW6BA0,"This product is a collection of American Dad episodes created by Amazon. The case is a generic DVD case, with a poorly printed insert. The DVD-Rs that you receive contain the episodes, but the quality is sub-par. They look like someone recorded them. There is no normal home screen content, just a menu with the ability to select the episode you want.

This product is cheap and NOT a genuine product. I didn't notice that this was a cheap knockoff until I received the item, a basic DVD case and poorly printed insert, poorly shrinkwrapped to appear like a real, brand new, extra special item for people that don't know any better.

All the episodes are uncensored and very much not for kids.  As has been the case with both Family Guy and American Dad, nothing is off limits to make fun of, and they pretty well go all out in everything.

The reason to knock it down two stars is the DVD release.  They have gone the total cheap route and instead of doing a regular release where you get well manufactured discs, and some bonus material, this is just the episodes burned on to a DVD-R disc.  Really the only reason to get this is if you have the prior seasons on DVD and want it for a collection.

I hope this is a wakeup call for both FOX & American Dad's new network TBS.  When you cut corners to save a few bucks, even violate some FCC and ADA rules that alienate customers with disabilities, it's going to hurt their pocketbook somewhere.

6482131,1,B00LFW6BA0,"We're extremely disappointed with the quality of this release.  Even ignoring the issue that this is Manufacture-On-Demand and released on DVD-Rs, it's still a big disappointment.

No special features.  No commentary tracks.  There aren't even subtitles.  And the menus are the bare minimum to actually choose which episode to watch.  This is the kind of quality you'd expect from a bootleg release you buy off eBay, not an official release from FOX.

The video quality is also pretty sad - noticeable artifacting and ghosting.  It's a bad sign when the original broadcast of the show is far better quality than the release in question.

The one bright side is that the episodes in question are indeed uncensored.  This is literally the only advantage this release has over just downloading a torrent of the original broadcast or watching on Netflix.

In fact, the season in question is available on Netflix, in HD, with subtitles.  Watch that instead, and skip this release unless you really want to hear the characters occasionally say swear words.",1411171200,8,1050,5.040697674418604

MOD discs mean that the bottom of the discs are purple and have been privately burned by Fox to save money.  They scratch easier and don't last as long.  But you pay full price.  No deleted scenes or extra footage.  Also no animations in disc menu.

other then that the episodes are funny and the quality of picture is the same.",1410566400,24,363,4.409090909090909

So, it's come to this.

What with Fox taking the show off its network lineup starting in October, this show's all but dead at this point. We'll get one season on TBS and then it'll be over. Meanwhile, Family Guy, which has been on autopilot for years now, will continue to do so, becoming even more like The Simpsons.

Well, it was a good run while it lasted, and Lord knows Fox has been trying to kill this show off since about 2008.

I'll by this set, even though all of the episodes are readily available on either Netflix and Hulu.

Hopefully, this show will get resurrected with some DVD movies like Futurama did, but I doubt it. Here's hoping the show at least gets to 200 episodes.  The count is 175 so far with 15 episodes planned.

And may whatever show ends up in American Dad's timeslot fail horribly....",1410307200,35,846,4.526315789473684

DVD-R is a massive slap in the face of fans like me ! Maybe this ist a good solution for niche products for a few hundred people, like an old movie almost nobody remembers.

But I can not accept a current, succesful series on inferior media like this. Charging the full price for this... it's just smelly icing on a disgusting cake.

8665648,4,B00LFW6BA0,"I have been having problems with V11 freezing on all three discs.  So I looked into making a personal backup and discovered something amazing!  V11's discs are purple, as is every brand/type of write-once DVD media that I've seen.  When I checked out V9, I found the discs are silver.  The same for V10.  Using the PC program ImgBurn, I looked at the specs for all three.  V11 is DVD+R-DL.  V9 and V10 are DVD_ROM.  I can only reason from this that V9 and V10 are pressed discs.  Maybe MOD sales were high enough that it was more financially prudent to run off some pressings.  Note that the content is exactly the same:  Simple menu; No subtitles, extras, commentary, etc.  I did make a backup of V11 to .ISO files on my PC using ImgBurn.  ImgBurn will NOT copy protected discs, so my V11 is not copy protected.  To the best of my knowledge, I am allowed to make one backup copy.  I am NOT allowed to circumvent copy protection to do so.  Since my V11 is not copy protected, there was nothing to circumvent.

  One content complaint that I've found.  V10's menu music is about 15db louder than the show audio.  I usually start the disc on mute and only turn it off when the show starts.  V9's menu and show audio (sadly stereo only) match, but are about the same level as V10's menu music.  V11's menu and show audio match, but are about the same level as V10's show audio.  You can tell they went out of their way to precision craft these discs. <BG>  I am not exaggerating about the sound.  I just metered all three discs' levels.  I set it so V9's menu music was showing around 0db.  Menu and show audio matched.  V10's menu music also is around 0db.  The show audio averages around -15db (quieter).  Both of V11's audios average around -15db.

  Note:  I have no affiliation with ImgBurn.  It's just the program I use.  Many other programs can report the type of disc and make backups.

  I gave it four stars because of no subtitles or extra features.",1514851200,,1957,4.387640449438202
