8358723,3,B0029ZAN0G,"I bought this video to supplement materials for a class I teach.  Some of the information in it was good , but some was not so accurate.  I showed it with a ""disqualifier"" to my class to take the information that seemed to enhance the other class information that was presented.",1293494400,,278,4.431372549019608

It shows that there is hope and that, with help, support, and conviction, this addiction can be overcome.  Very inspiring.",1285891200,,280,4.791666666666667
8358725,5,B0029ZAN0G,"This DVD not only helps provide instruction for someone caught up in the web of addiction to pornography, but to a spouse or loved one that may be struggling with that person's addiction too. It explains how prevalent pornography addiction is (more than drugs, alcohol, or tobacco) and the various means that make it so accessible, and also so easy to hide. That is until this addiction has become so ingrained that often an addict seems to literally become a different person to themselves, their family, and to others. Some wives tend to think this change must have something to do with their own personal appeal, while in fact, the addict feels great shame because as much as they want to break the hold this has on them, they don't know how. This is an honest look at men that are recovering, a wife that is learning to trust again, and a wife that spent 15 years in therapy with a husband that refused to
give it up, and how she had the courage to know when enough was enough. Simple, but heartfelt.",1249516800,2,1004,4.491803278688525
