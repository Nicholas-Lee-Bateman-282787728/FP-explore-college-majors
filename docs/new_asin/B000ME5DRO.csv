8585853,1,B000ME5DRO,"I gave this to my father who is a big WWII buff for Christmas.  I was ashamed as we watched this.  Constant pausing and extremely blurry footage to go along with extremely BORING footage of car dealerships on the home front. Who cares?  The seller did refund my money so if you think it stinks too, they will give you your money back so take advantage of that option.  However, both the seller and creator of this pathetic DVD should be ashamed and embarrassed. Easily the worst WWII film I have ever seen.  This DVD is terrible!",1236643200,,529,4.412371134020619
