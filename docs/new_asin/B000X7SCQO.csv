2999037,5,B000X7SCQO,"At first I was a little (no, a LOT) hesitant to order this Warners archive edition of this movie.  I had only seen really poor quality public domain versions of this outstanding film (and actually owned a couple in cheap movie collection sets), and I didn't realize that this was a full restoration.

What a pleasant shock I had when I went ahead and ordered a copy, and then watched the glorious Technicolor film in practically pristine condition! I almost couldn't believe how beautiful the movie is, since I was too young to see it in the theatre in 1954.

The film is not exactly a masterpiece, but the improved look of it in this new edition actually improves everything about it--or at least it creates the illusion that it's a better film than it certainly used to be in those flat-looking, pale, washed-out versions available previously.

BTW, I still grin at the opening menu that shows the Warner Brothers water tower and WB logo because this is an MGM movie without question, and Warners could not have made as pretty a film as this in 1954!  ""A Star is Born"" notwithstanding!!!",1465603200,,1089,4.651041666666667

Read SCREAM QUEENS interview of Sandy Drescher to discover how they made her do lousy ballet moves, the cute little kid (famous for THEM).  This movie was Sandy's favorite part, probably because of all the nice stars she worked with.  The movie is so full of over-acting that Paris took a cinematic beating.  The drawing of Liz Taylor on the bar wall is freaky.  Donna Reed looks entirely p'd-off through the whole movie; what an enforced sourpuss expression.  And what studio flak insisted that the theme song should be played over almost every scene?  Definitely 1954 soap opera directing.  Van Johnson did so many Jim Carey (sp?) expressions that I began to wonder if the director was making faces at him from behind the camera.

The story,largely set in Paris in the heady Post Liberation days,of the Second World War,concerns two young people who's lives and families are blighted by success and drink. We follow the downward spiral to destruction of their relationships, the  death of the wife and mother--beautifully played by Elisabeth Taylor--and we witness the bereaved husbands eventual attempt,successful thankfully,to redeem himself and recover his self respect. This part is played by actor Van Johnson,and it is undoubtedly one of the best performances of his career too,not to be missed..
The novel,itself, originally written by the great American author F.Scott Fitzgerald,a man who had his social problems too,,pulls no punches,neither does the film script .and for those of us who have an over fondness for the ""Turps"",it doesn't make for comfortable viewing at times.

These ladies are positively breathtaking in looks and oozing with charm.

I make no apologies as the scripts were just so much better back in the ""olden days."" This was an epic soap opera back in it's day, and it was also Elizabeth Taylor's true role to stardom.  Rather than simply being a ravishing screen beauty, it is in this film that she truly rose to her abilities and created a lovely, complex character on screen. I would never discredit the talented Van Johnson as his acting in this film is stellar. The emotions and heartache he is able to reach of a man's love for his wife and child, are completely heart-wrenching in such a romantic film.

2999074,4,B000X7SCQO,"FIRST AND FOREMOST:
DO make sure you purchase the Warner Brother's ARCHIVE COLLECTION of this movie. There are a few others floating around that are VERY bad transfers. (The one in the Elizabeth Taylor boxed set is truly appalling in quality!)
The release I mention above, while not absolutely perfect, is certainly very watchable.

Now to the movie.
Elizabeth Taylor never looked more beautiful, ...and she's gowned to perfection.
One pale pink beaded ball gown looks like something Marie Antoinette might have worn, ....had she had money....!

She gives a very believable performance here too, minus any whiny Southern accents.
It's the material she's given which is at fault. The movie is unsure as to whether she's a tearaway free-spirit, ...or the dutiful wife and long-suffering mother.
One minute she's being arrested for jumping into fountains, then we see her trying to salvage her husband's self esteem.
This is probably more a fault in the screenplay's adaption from the original story than anything else.

Walter Pigeon plays a sort of ageing rou, ...perennially broke, fond of ""get-rich-quick"" schemes and always borrowing money, but charming in a roguish sort of way.

I've never been a great fan of Van Johnson. He's perfectly adequate here, but I find him somewhat lacking in charisma as a romantic lead. Just how many damn freckles can anyone have on their forehead anyway?
The Archive print certainly brings up the detail!
He plays an F. Scott Fitzgerald sort of wannabee writer, (the aforementioned having written this story), and struggles to produce his first great novel, while flirting with alcoholism and marital infidelity along the way.
A series of rejection slips sees him suffer psychological problems of self worth, and developing quite the careless approach to life. Fast cars and fast women, ...in the form of Eva Gabor become his escape.

Gabor plays.....well herself really. (She's always between husbands here, just as in real life, and certainly not above borrowing somebody else's!)
Watch for her disdain when she takes part in the Monte Carlo rally in an open topped sports car during a rainstorm!

Frankly I could not fathom as to why Johnson would even be interested in Gabor's artifice, when he already had Elizabeth Taylor?

Anyway, ....Johnson's character can't get it up as a writer and he descends in an almost suicidal spiral of booze and self-loathing.
Donna Reed gets an unflattering role, ...the less attractive sister of Taylor. Reed has always so obviously been in love with Johnson, but he chooses to marry her more fascinating sister, while Reed is left to carry a long-burning torch, despite her marriage to another man.
The curiosity of the movie is seeing a very young Roger Moore play a gigolo cum tennis player, long before James Bond was even mentioned.
He's suitably ""gorgeous"", but you just know he's a cad.

Now as we all know so well, ....you simply cannot be an ""artist"", or a ""writer"" unless you have SUFFERED. (Intentional capitals for emphasis!)
We all realise that's why Johnson keeps getting those rejection slips! He's got it too good!
He's got Liz for a start!
Anyway, ...without giving away any spoilers, fate and his own death wish eventually takes care of that and voil.....HE SUFFERS!!!
(And how!)
NOW of course he can write, and success quickly follows!  See? Simple!

Now some of this is actual location work in Paris, but much is back in the studio on some fairly obvious sets with painted street scene backdrops.
(I'm sure the quite elaborate one under the bridge near Ntre Dame was later used again in the execrable ""Made in Paris"" with Ann Margaret!)
The very popular title tune gets a serious workout here, being played in various forms throughout most of the film.
It does become a little tiring, ...but nowhere near as annoying as the tediously grating repetition of that schmaltzy Mancini-mush in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""!

The main problem with this movie today is that you can always see where it's going. Fitzgerald was never a very original writer when it came to plots. The enjoyment for us is the cast, some great performances with the material given, ...and some pretty nifty set dressing, not to mention those gowns to die for.
Four stars from me, ...I'd give it 4 if that was possible. I'm a sucker for anything even remotely about Paris, but this certainly has eye-appeal and holds your interest throughout, despite the contrivance of the ending.",1400112000,,4440,4.978407557354926
2999075,3,B000X7SCQO,"The Last Time I Saw Paris, 1954 film

A man with a suitcase leaves a Paris train station. He walks by an open market and a small amusement park. [His lack of a hat show changing styles.] He thinks of Paris after its liberation, people celebrated in the streets and at home. Helen was expelled from her university. The talk is about money. Wills is from Milwaukee. What will he do after the war has ended? He is a journalist. They sing La Marseillaise (a song from the French Revolution). Wills becomes friendly with Helen (she spent the war in Switzerland). Wills brings a box of groceries. A hot tip on a horse race? Charles is warned against this. That horse wins! Was it intuition or a fix? Betting on the end of the war? Helen is in the hospital - the flu. More talk about money. You don't need money to have fun in Paris. [Believable?] What will make Helen happy? Marianne also.

Helen has gained weight, she is no longer a size ten. Claude was appointed as Prosecutor. Charles types an article. Time passes. Charles book is rejected. There is a New Years celebration. Is mediocrity the key to a successful novel? [Know our audience?] Helen Wills jumped into a fountain and was arrested. Did she want to get into print? They visit a bistro. An artist paints a portrait of Helen at a fountain. Her daughter Vickie dances en pointe. Charles will interview a woman, Mrs. Quale. She has been divorced four times before. [Is she a danger?] Charles meets Claude and his wife Marion when leaving the bistro. A telephone call brings news of an oil strike on their lands. Can it be $50,000 a year? [The prices date this picture, the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour then.] They go on a spending spree. But Charles remains in his room. His novels are rejected. Was his life wasted? Charles loses money arm-wrestling. [Can an office worker match a manual laborer?]

Charles continues his typing, he is starting over. [His hands are hidden to simulate typing.] Vickie has lost a front tooth. They meet a tennis bum. There is a party. Is Charles drinking too much? Helen wants to go home, leaving the party early. [Do people talk about an absent guest?] Is their life in Paris boring? A car race pads out the story. There is a crash in the rain! [Do you see a problem developing?] There is personal conflict. Helen spends time with Paul. [Is it her looks or her money?] Its done all the time. [Note the roads in winter.]

Helen walks in the rain to her sisters home. Take care of Vickie. Ill always love you. Charles mourns Helen. Later he meets Vickie. [Note her hairdo.] Charles wants Vickie back, so does Vickie. Things have changed, he didn't recognize anyone at the Dingo bar in the afternoon. Charles is writing short stories now. Marion refuses to let Vickie leave. [What would you do?] She hates Charles, Claude explains why. [A psychologist?] Could Charles be reunited with his daughter for a happy ending?

I wonder if a popular song was used as a vehicle for this story? Is this a warning about the idle rich who live in a foreign country? I never read the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald (and never will). While set after WW II it seems more likely after WW I (to me).",1393804800,,3170,4.496527777777778

2999082,3,B000X7SCQO,"This movie was okay, but I wouldn't watch it again.  Taylor was quite good.  Van Johnson was tiresome.  I realize he was a drunk and a very convincing one, but that type of character who whines and drinks himself into oblivion just because he hasn't been able to publish his manuscripts and loses his family because of it--I have no patience for such characters.  One thing that bugged me was why Taylor's character got so sick after just getting wet.  They should have developed that part a bit more--why does she get sick easily???  The time lapses were abrupt, too, and no one really changed appearance.",1372550400,,606,4.669811320754717
2999083,3,B000X7SCQO,"The movie dates from 1954 and might be considered a classic by fans of these actors and of old movies in general, but I didn't find it very ""compelling.""  For some reason, I wasn't able to care about the story very much--until the end.

The story begins as Americans in Paris are celebrating the end of WWII.  A love story begins in which two sisters like the same guy.  (This was the only movie in which I've ever liked Van Johnson fairly well myself.  His face had the appearance of a more sensitive character than usual; he seemed slenderer or somehow less characteristic of his appearance in other movies.)  The sisters move on into their two separate marriages and troubles.  The plot focuses on the frustration of this American ex-soldier who is unable to succeed as a writer.  He becomes alcoholic, commits adultery.  His wife is mortally wounded emotionally by his unfaithfulness.  (The story is based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Babylon Revisited"" and the character of the writer must partly represent Fitzgerald himself and his wife and associates.)

The theme music of the movie is beautiful and the viewer has the opportunity to hear ""The Last Time I saw Paris"" played and replayed, expressing a gamut of moods in the background.  The nostalgic mood of the movie felt over-emphasized to me.  Too often, the main character returns in memory to the little Parisian cafe where the mural of his beautiful Beloved is an aching, sentimental focal point.  (I think the film-makers evoked that ""Cafe Memory"" about 4 times altogether and I became tired of it.  The sense of nostalgia that it was supposed to generate turned to a sense of my own irritation at the repetition.  But, perhaps that dwelling upon a painful memory was symptomatic of this man's alcoholism.)

Finally in the last minutes of the story which hold in the balance the fate of a child (whom I found likable and lovable), there is a turning point which resolves the frustrations of the persons remaining alive in this situation which has played out over a period of about 8 years.  A sense of redemption and peace through forgiveness is made possible for all who've been tormented by stand-offs and hard feelings, jealousy and unforgiveness.  While this denouement finally makes the movie blessedly worthwhile, it sure takes a long time to go through some ineffectual drama and finally get to the satisfaction of it.

Elizabeth Taylor is exquisitely pretty in this movie, young and slender and looking her best.  But the movie-maker uses her as a clothes-horse.  The viewer can't help noticing that she is wearing one attractive different outfit after another  as the story moves from one scene to the next.  (I wondered, ""Would it be realistic that this character would have so many clothes?"")  I guess all the chic clothing was typical ""Hollywood"" in those days.  Viewers (especially women movie-goers) were still expecting to get a lot of inspiration from the costumes and fashions ""modeled"" by the ""Stars"".

I saw a VHS version of the movie that had been colorized, but the color faded back into black and white a lot.  Oddly, in my memory I see the movie as being in black and white even though I do recall that there were colorized scenes and that they were pleasanter than the black and white ones.  I imagine that the colorized and more panoramic versions of the movie make the Parisian settings more attractive and enjoyable.",1367193600,,3405,4.832469775474957
2999084,1,B000X7SCQO,"Because these two main stars are of another generation and were great in their day, I tried to find something positive about it through the story line.  I  feel it is completly from another time line and generation, the 1950's and most of the subject matter really does not apply in the lives of people today in 2013.  The smoking and drinking in the movie and the petty underlining physicology is not viewed as healthy living in our society today.  So half way through the 2nd time I tried to watch it, I had to turn it off.  I felt it was historical to to view it once, but not twice.
Many of the movies I watch today are helpful to me in keeping up with the generation that I now live in.  If I don't keep up with our generation, it's  technology and physicology I can become out of touch.  Even though movies are sometimes far fetched and very different from reality they are a very good way to keep up and try to understand the generation in which we live today.  This keeps me young and in touch with the world I live in.  I was born in 1936 and feel like I am still in my 40's or 50's today.",1365811200,,1098,4.112676056338028

The party is over at least for Taylor, but Johnson has trouble taking his new responsibilities seriously.

2999090,4,B000X7SCQO,"This review is about the story, not about the actors/actresses. The story is about an American army guy in France after WII. He meets two girls whom are sisters. Both fall in love with him although he is attracted the most beautiful women (Elizabeth Taylor). In her role she was totally dedicated to him and wanted nothing more in life than to be his wife. To have someone who loves you to that extreme is so rare and he abuses the relationship. What an idiot! Speaking from my own prospective what more can you ask for in life than to have an angel who loves you. Interesting she dies and they have a kid who the other sister has possession and she (the other sister) is bitter because he didn't love her, etc... In the end he gets his daughter back.

2999096,4,B000X7SCQO,"At the end of WWII in Paris, a G.I. (Van Johnson) meets an attractive American (Donna Reed) in a bar but when he meets her sister (Elizabeth Taylor), it's love at first sight. Based on the short story BABYLON REVISITED by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film has been updated from its 1920s ""lost generation"" setting to post WWII Paris. Yet the setting seems wrong because the characters themselves still feel like they walked out of his TENDER IS THE NIGHT. That aside, the film remains a glossy and lush melodrama of a free spirit (Taylor) mismatched with a buttoned down newsman (Johnson, the film's only weak link). Taylor is at her most movie goddess beautiful here and looks terrific in her Helen Rose gowns. In contrast, Reed overdoes the bottled up, resentful sister. The Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein song The Last Time I Saw Paris is lovely but overused in the underscore to the point of distraction. It could use a remake but this time utilizing the original 1920s setting. Directed by Richard Brooks. With Walter Pidgeon, Roger Moore, Eva Gabor, George Dolenz, Kurt Kasznar, Sandy Descher, Celia Lovsky, John Doucette and Ann Codee.

2999099,4,B000X7SCQO,"With some strong performances (Taylor, Pidgeon and Johnson were all Oscar worthy), a two-hanky level storyline (yes, there will be tears) and an effervescent atmosphere created by the otherworldly Paris, `The Last Time I Saw Paris' is a wonderful film that will captivate from start to finish.

The film revolves around a young GI named Charles Wills who happens across a family with two daughters, both ripe for the picking and yet it is the vivacious Helen who steals his heart, much to the disappointment of her sister Marion.  Charles is not rich, but he is handsome and charming and his heart is big enough to swallow Helen whole.  Soon they are married and embarking on a life of love and happiness and a beautiful daughter and eventual struggles and broken trust and mistakes and frustrations and heartbreak.  Yes, life is never easy, and Charles and Helen find that out that hard way when their marriage begins to fray at the seams.  Charles' endeavor to become a published author weighs a heavy burden on his soul as rejection continues to corrode his demeanor, and Helen finds herself lost in a freedom she can't control and her unhappiness bleeds into flirtatious affection-seeking around other men.  With the judgmental eyes of Marion lurking around their every move, and the drunken habits of Helen's father, James, rearing their head in the early morning hours, Charles and Helen completely fall to pieces.

But there is no denying that they are in love.

There are moments within `The Last Time I Saw Paris' that are obvious manipulations, but they are handled with care.  The opening section and the closing are brilliantly conceived, completely powerful and emotionally complex.  There are moments in the film's center that meander a little, and the time shifts are a tad drastic in parts.  Despite the flaws though, this is a really well done film that will grab you and keep you close.  Taylor is fantastic, delivering a `complete' performance.  She starts off carefree and exotic, using her body and her voice to tease the audience (as well as Charles), but as the marriage strain sets in her demeanor changes and she begins to harden.  The way she handles that shift is remarkable.  Even her line readings are spot on (""you far less beat up than you ought to be"").  And then, as she desperately tries to save her marriage you can feel that passion swell inside her; right down to the way she holds her husband's head against her face.  Walter Pidgeon is also great here, comedic gold (he hits every mark), and Donna Reed uses her facial expressions to superb effect.  To me though, this film is all about Van Johnson.  His portrayal of Charles is remarkable.  He bleeds with such emotional frustrations.  As his career collapses you can feel his despair and as he seeks refuge in the arms of a stranger you can feel the guilt rise in his throat.  His soliloquy alone was flawlessly executed (and this is from someone who loathes soliloquies).

And that final act, with his daughter...just wow.

As a whole, the film itself really needed a sharper hand in its center, but the acting alone is so breathtaking that it demands to be seen and lauded.",1318291200,,3166,4.7775735294117645

the company Marengo Films has a dvd that is a double feature--like all of their dvds are--of ""Love Affair"" and ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" and it looks fantastic compared to every other crappy public domain dvd I have seen.
Because of the fact that this film was filmed with the Technicolor process copies of the film often look hopelessly blurry.
even though the Marengo dvd is not perfect, it is far clearer than any other version I have bought.
Marengo Films has many other dvd double features, and while they all might not be the best versions available, anyone looking for public domain titles should always look to see if a Marengo Films dvd version exists.
look for them and ROAN Group.
Those 2 companies are consistently the best from what I can tell after a bunch of trial and error with many companies.

2999105,3,B000X7SCQO,"Updating a story to present day sometimes doesn't work, even with top stars and production values. In the case of this sentimental 1950's drama, everyone seems to be in a different age calling for a different sensibility.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote his short story ""Babylon Revisited"" as a look back on the Jazz Age he knew so well. Paramount was going to film it, but that never happened. Gregory Peck was set to star at one point, but that too didn't materialize. When MGM got ahold of the rights to the story, the studio bosses decided to skip the 1920's in favor of the post-World War II period up to then-present day, says the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com).

To that end, writer-director Richard Brooks took a solid screenplay by the Epstein twins (the guys who helped make ""Casablanca"" a classic) and updated it per studio demands.

""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" isn't a bad movie - Elizabeth Taylor, Van Johnson, Walter Pidgeon and Donna Reed headline - but their characters seem trapped in a pre-Depression Paris mindset rather than the postwar period around them. One good outcome: Elizabeth Taylor later said this ""not so good picture"" helped her to realize she wanted to be an actress and would have to work at it.

Brooks got something out of the experience, too. He realized he needed to get out of MGM if he wanted to do movies his way - writing them and directing them the way he felt they should be done. Such independence would come only by getting out of his contract or by directing a huge hit that would give him leverage at MGM for doing things his way. Fortunately for Brooks, he got that hit with his next movie, ""Blackboard Jungle.""

All that and a great cast, including a Gabor sister (they are interchangable aren't they?), a James Bond guy, Roger Moore who is unbeliveably young, posh and just as annoying then as he is now,Donna Reed, the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor and the lovable and oddly handsome Van Johnson. It's Paris and the War is ending, and can you believe it? Donna Reed and Elizabeth Taylor are sisters! Sounds weird, but works. Liz and Donna have an endearing father, who loves to party and lives like he has money, when in fact he has little. Van and Liz fall in love expressing sweet senitment in lovely and urgent prose, that would only work between young lovers, one a soldier and the other a young beauty, tired of war.

It's fun to get caught up in their blossoming romance and watch their love grow into a trusting relationship, that eventually gives way to some unpleasant moments, brought on by Van's attempts to write the Great American Novel and the sudden and unexpected wealth of Liz's family.

I loved seeing Paris officially light up for the first time after the war, and darling, no one can play a bed-ridden scene like Liz.

2999121,5,B000X7SCQO,"This film is a beautiful achievement about several issues. First about WW2, the liberation of Paris and the role the Americans played in that event. Some Americans stayed behind and made Paris their  capital , their regular living quarters because of the artistic and easygoing atmosphere of the city, because of what they thought was the permanent celebrating calvacade. No surprise that George fell into the trap, married a young beauty and tried to live up to this city. But he failed. And that is the second achievement. It is a perfect love affair and lifelong love for a woman that he idolizes and yet is unable to equal and even to come close to. He fails his own love and he destroys himself in alcohol to forget his failure. She will die because of it, leaving him and their daughter stranded behind. This is a lesson about achieving anything in life : achievement is a lot harder than striving for it, a lot more haphazard and unguaranteed and when the illusion disappears there is nothing left but frustration and selfdestruction. Then George is torn apart by his love for the departed woman, his wife, and his guilt about it, the jealousy of her sister who grabs the daughter and gets a court order to take care of her, and his desire to recuperate his daughter that finds a similar desire in the girl who wants to live with her daddy. The sister will have to realize that she is chastizing him for her own sister's death, for her own rejection as a possible wife and for her incapability to have a child of her own with her own husband. The end of this film is an absolute tear-shedding scene that should rip the heart of any viewer apart. An amazing Elizabeth Taylor is enhancing the film with the art of one of the best actresses of those times.

2999122,5,B000X7SCQO,"Here in The Last Time I Saw Paris an interesting thing happens. Elizabeth Taylor becomes a woman. Before this picture there were really only two other outstanding performances by Miss Taylor. Or I should say where she was allowed to rise above the material. The first being of course the rhapsodic National Velvet and the second the astonishing A Place In The Sun. The films in between those and The Last Time I Saw Paris were mostly along the  ""Isn't she beautiful?"" line of movie making, and, why not?  That was the main engine of most Hollywood star vehicles of the day.  A Star didn't have to be a talent. But it was essential to possess a presence that reached out from the screen and touched the audience in a primal way. Miss Taylor had that in spades but she had much more that was often eclipsed in the dazzling explosion of her extraordinary almost alien beauty.
  But here in the hands of director Richard Brooks (who would later lead her to her triumph in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof) Miss Taylor finds a new level in her abilities as an actress.  Her Helen is a woman of many layers and dark corners, of mercurial flights and deep sadness.  Elizabeth at the tender age of 22 grasps all the aspects of this tragic woman and illuminates not only the screen with them but the whole enterprise as well.  She shows us where she, as an actress is going in the future. And who she will become in her later films, one of the best screen actresses of the twentieth century.  This is the real beginning of the Elizabeth Taylor of legend. She fills the role as no one of her generation could. Never again after this film would she sleepwalk through a film, a beautiful shadow to dream over.
  She is aided in what is perhaps one of Van Johnson's best performances. Donna Reed scores high in the role of Helen's bitter sister and Walter Pidgon is a delight as her roguish father. A standout cameo is presented by Eva Gabor, (not Zsa Zsa) the only one of the famous sisters who had any real talent. The only false performance in the film comes from child actress Sandy Descher. When you compare her forced and overly cute performance to that of the child Elizabeth Taylor in ""Jane Eyre"" then you see what a treasure Miss Taylor has always been.
  There is something so essentially wonderful in this gem from MGM and it is this. The Last Time I Saw Pairs is the perfect example of the last flowering in the 50's of the ""woman's picture"".  Films where women could be multi faceted and complex and drive the story on under their own steam as whole human beings.  This is a window to the 50's and a style of filmmaking that seems gone forever, great stories of strong women who fill the screen with power and grace.  But with ""Far From Heaven"" and ""The Hours"" I may be wrong about forever.
  I recommend this admittedly dated but charming film for anyone who wants to see what screen acting is all about. It is about thinking and Miss Taylor is a master at the craft.",1059609600,,2957,4.404411764705882

Walter Pigeon appears as the eccentric father of the bride and Donna Reed is the older sister who tries to run the family with good sense and is often rebuffed.
When everyone is poor and struggling things hold together but when the family falls into money then everything crashes down.

It was the first time since Angela Vickers in A Place in the Sun, that she was proud of her work. She  got rave reviews and both her talent and appearance is startling.  I can`t  remember seeing her so natural and good in any other picture.  The film has  been dogged by many critics and has suffered from little reputation.

I had only seen really poor quality public domain versions of this outstanding film (and actually owned a couple in cheap movie collection sets), and I didn't realize that this was a full restoration.

What a pleasant shock I had when I went ahead and ordered a copy, and then watched the glorious Technicolor film in practically pristine condition! I almost couldn't believe how beautiful the movie is, since I was too young to see it in the theatre in 1954.

The film is not exactly a masterpiece, but the improved look of it in this new edition actually improves everything about it--or at least it creates the illusion that it's a better film than it certainly used to be in those flat-looking, pale, washed-out versions available previously.

BTW, I still grin at the opening menu that shows the Warner Brothers water tower and WB logo because this is an MGM movie without question, and Warners could not have made as pretty a film as this in 1954!  ""A Star is Born"" notwithstanding!!!",1465603200,,1089,4.651041666666667

The story,largely set in Paris in the heady Post Liberation days,of the Second World War,concerns two young people who's lives and families are blighted by success and drink. We follow the downward spiral to destruction of their relationships, the  death of the wife and mother--beautifully played by Elisabeth Taylor--and we witness the bereaved husbands eventual attempt,successful thankfully,to redeem himself and recover his self respect. This part is played by actor Van Johnson,and it is undoubtedly one of the best performances of his career too,not to be missed..

3233571,4,B000X7SCQO,"FIRST AND FOREMOST:
DO make sure you purchase the Warner Brother's ARCHIVE COLLECTION of this movie. There are a few others floating around that are VERY bad transfers. (The one in the Elizabeth Taylor boxed set is truly appalling in quality!)
The release I mention above, while not absolutely perfect, is certainly very watchable.

Now to the movie.
Elizabeth Taylor never looked more beautiful, ...and she's gowned to perfection.
One pale pink beaded ball gown looks like something Marie Antoinette might have worn, ....had she had money....!

She gives a very believable performance here too, minus any whiny Southern accents.
It's the material she's given which is at fault. The movie is unsure as to whether she's a tearaway free-spirit, ...or the dutiful wife and long-suffering mother.
One minute she's being arrested for jumping into fountains, then we see her trying to salvage her husband's self esteem.
This is probably more a fault in the screenplay's adaption from the original story than anything else.

Walter Pigeon plays a sort of ageing rou, ...perennially broke, fond of ""get-rich-quick"" schemes and always borrowing money, but charming in a roguish sort of way.

I've never been a great fan of Van Johnson. He's perfectly adequate here, but I find him somewhat lacking in charisma as a romantic lead. Just how many damn freckles can anyone have on their forehead anyway?
The Archive print certainly brings up the detail!
He plays an F. Scott Fitzgerald sort of wannabee writer, (the aforementioned having written this story), and struggles to produce his first great novel, while flirting with alcoholism and marital infidelity along the way.
A series of rejection slips sees him suffer psychological problems of self worth, and developing quite the careless approach to life. Fast cars and fast women, ...in the form of Eva Gabor become his escape.

Gabor plays.....well herself really. (She's always between husbands here, just as in real life, and certainly not above borrowing somebody else's!)
Watch for her disdain when she takes part in the Monte Carlo rally in an open topped sports car during a rainstorm!

Frankly I could not fathom as to why Johnson would even be interested in Gabor's artifice, when he already had Elizabeth Taylor?

Anyway, ....Johnson's character can't get it up as a writer and he descends in an almost suicidal spiral of booze and self-loathing.
Donna Reed gets an unflattering role, ...the less attractive sister of Taylor. Reed has always so obviously been in love with Johnson, but he chooses to marry her more fascinating sister, while Reed is left to carry a long-burning torch, despite her marriage to another man.
The curiosity of the movie is seeing a very young Roger Moore play a gigolo cum tennis player, long before James Bond was even mentioned.
He's suitably ""gorgeous"", but you just know he's a cad.

Now as we all know so well, ....you simply cannot be an ""artist"", or a ""writer"" unless you have SUFFERED. (Intentional capitals for emphasis!)
We all realise that's why Johnson keeps getting those rejection slips! He's got it too good!
He's got Liz for a start!
Anyway, ...without giving away any spoilers, fate and his own death wish eventually takes care of that and voil.....HE SUFFERS!!!
(And how!)
NOW of course he can write, and success quickly follows!  See? Simple!

Now some of this is actual location work in Paris, but much is back in the studio on some fairly obvious sets with painted street scene backdrops.
(I'm sure the quite elaborate one under the bridge near Ntre Dame was later used again in the execrable ""Made in Paris"" with Ann Margaret!)
The very popular title tune gets a serious workout here, being played in various forms throughout most of the film.
It does become a little tiring, ...but nowhere near as annoying as the tediously grating repetition of that schmaltzy Mancini-mush in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""!

The main problem with this movie today is that you can always see where it's going. Fitzgerald was never a very original writer when it came to plots. The enjoyment for us is the cast, some great performances with the material given, ...and some pretty nifty set dressing, not to mention those gowns to die for.
Four stars from me, ...I'd give it 4 if that was possible. I'm a sucker for anything even remotely about Paris, but this certainly has eye-appeal and holds your interest throughout, despite the contrivance of the ending.",1400112000,,4440,4.978407557354926
3233572,3,B000X7SCQO,"The Last Time I Saw Paris, 1954 film

A man with a suitcase leaves a Paris train station. He walks by an open market and a small amusement park. [His lack of a hat show changing styles.] He thinks of Paris after its liberation, people celebrated in the streets and at home. Helen was expelled from her university. The talk is about money. Wills is from Milwaukee. What will he do after the war has ended? He is a journalist. They sing La Marseillaise (a song from the French Revolution). Wills becomes friendly with Helen (she spent the war in Switzerland). Wills brings a box of groceries. A hot tip on a horse race? Charles is warned against this. That horse wins! Was it intuition or a fix? Betting on the end of the war? Helen is in the hospital - the flu. More talk about money. You don't need money to have fun in Paris. [Believable?] What will make Helen happy? Marianne also.

Helen has gained weight, she is no longer a size ten. Claude was appointed as Prosecutor. Charles types an article. Time passes. Charles book is rejected. There is a New Years celebration. Is mediocrity the key to a successful novel? [Know our audience?] Helen Wills jumped into a fountain and was arrested. Did she want to get into print? They visit a bistro. An artist paints a portrait of Helen at a fountain. Her daughter Vickie dances en pointe. Charles will interview a woman, Mrs. Quale. She has been divorced four times before. [Is she a danger?] Charles meets Claude and his wife Marion when leaving the bistro. A telephone call brings news of an oil strike on their lands. Can it be $50,000 a year? [The prices date this picture, the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour then.] They go on a spending spree. But Charles remains in his room. His novels are rejected. Was his life wasted? Charles loses money arm-wrestling. [Can an office worker match a manual laborer?]

Charles continues his typing, he is starting over. [His hands are hidden to simulate typing.] Vickie has lost a front tooth. They meet a tennis bum. There is a party. Is Charles drinking too much? Helen wants to go home, leaving the party early. [Do people talk about an absent guest?] Is their life in Paris boring? A car race pads out the story. There is a crash in the rain! [Do you see a problem developing?] There is personal conflict. Helen spends time with Paul. [Is it her looks or her money?] Its done all the time. [Note the roads in winter.]

Helen walks in the rain to her sisters home. Take care of Vickie. Ill always love you. Charles mourns Helen. Later he meets Vickie. [Note her hairdo.] Charles wants Vickie back, so does Vickie. Things have changed, he didn't recognize anyone at the Dingo bar in the afternoon. Charles is writing short stories now. Marion refuses to let Vickie leave. [What would you do?] She hates Charles, Claude explains why. [A psychologist?] Could Charles be reunited with his daughter for a happy ending?

I wonder if a popular song was used as a vehicle for this story? Is this a warning about the idle rich who live in a foreign country? I never read the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald (and never will). While set after WW II it seems more likely after WW I (to me).",1393804800,,3170,4.496527777777778

I realize he was a drunk and a very convincing one, but that type of character who whines and drinks himself into oblivion just because he hasn't been able to publish his manuscripts and loses his family because of it--I have no patience for such characters.  One thing that bugged me was why Taylor's character got so sick after just getting wet.  They should have developed that part a bit more--why does she get sick easily???  The time lapses were abrupt, too, and no one really changed appearance.",1372550400,,606,4.669811320754717
3233580,3,B000X7SCQO,"The movie dates from 1954 and might be considered a classic by fans of these actors and of old movies in general, but I didn't find it very ""compelling.""  For some reason, I wasn't able to care about the story very much--until the end.

The story begins as Americans in Paris are celebrating the end of WWII.  A love story begins in which two sisters like the same guy.  (This was the only movie in which I've ever liked Van Johnson fairly well myself.  His face had the appearance of a more sensitive character than usual; he seemed slenderer or somehow less characteristic of his appearance in other movies.)  The sisters move on into their two separate marriages and troubles.  The plot focuses on the frustration of this American ex-soldier who is unable to succeed as a writer.  He becomes alcoholic, commits adultery.  His wife is mortally wounded emotionally by his unfaithfulness.  (The story is based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Babylon Revisited"" and the character of the writer must partly represent Fitzgerald himself and his wife and associates.)

The theme music of the movie is beautiful and the viewer has the opportunity to hear ""The Last Time I saw Paris"" played and replayed, expressing a gamut of moods in the background.  The nostalgic mood of the movie felt over-emphasized to me.  Too often, the main character returns in memory to the little Parisian cafe where the mural of his beautiful Beloved is an aching, sentimental focal point.  (I think the film-makers evoked that ""Cafe Memory"" about 4 times altogether and I became tired of it.  The sense of nostalgia that it was supposed to generate turned to a sense of my own irritation at the repetition.  But, perhaps that dwelling upon a painful memory was symptomatic of this man's alcoholism.)

Finally in the last minutes of the story which hold in the balance the fate of a child (whom I found likable and lovable), there is a turning point which resolves the frustrations of the persons remaining alive in this situation which has played out over a period of about 8 years.  A sense of redemption and peace through forgiveness is made possible for all who've been tormented by stand-offs and hard feelings, jealousy and unforgiveness.  While this denouement finally makes the movie blessedly worthwhile, it sure takes a long time to go through some ineffectual drama and finally get to the satisfaction of it.

Elizabeth Taylor is exquisitely pretty in this movie, young and slender and looking her best.  But the movie-maker uses her as a clothes-horse.  The viewer can't help noticing that she is wearing one attractive different outfit after another  as the story moves from one scene to the next.  (I wondered, ""Would it be realistic that this character would have so many clothes?"")  I guess all the chic clothing was typical ""Hollywood"" in those days.  Viewers (especially women movie-goers) were still expecting to get a lot of inspiration from the costumes and fashions ""modeled"" by the ""Stars"".

I saw a VHS version of the movie that had been colorized, but the color faded back into black and white a lot.  Oddly, in my memory I see the movie as being in black and white even though I do recall that there were colorized scenes and that they were pleasanter than the black and white ones.  I imagine that the colorized and more panoramic versions of the movie make the Parisian settings more attractive and enjoyable.",1367193600,,3405,4.832469775474957
3233581,1,B000X7SCQO,"Because these two main stars are of another generation and were great in their day, I tried to find something positive about it through the story line.  I  feel it is completly from another time line and generation, the 1950's and most of the subject matter really does not apply in the lives of people today in 2013.  The smoking and drinking in the movie and the petty underlining physicology is not viewed as healthy living in our society today.  So half way through the 2nd time I tried to watch it, I had to turn it off.  I felt it was historical to to view it once, but not twice.
Many of the movies I watch today are helpful to me in keeping up with the generation that I now live in.  If I don't keep up with our generation, it's  technology and physicology I can become out of touch.  Even though movies are sometimes far fetched and very different from reality they are a very good way to keep up and try to understand the generation in which we live today.

This movie has been released previously in much cheaper versions, however Warner Brothers has restored it to its original beauty.  The colors and picture quality are breath-taking.

3233587,4,B000X7SCQO,"This review is about the story, not about the actors/actresses. The story is about an American army guy in France after WII. He meets two girls whom are sisters. Both fall in love with him although he is attracted the most beautiful women (Elizabeth Taylor). In her role she was totally dedicated to him and wanted nothing more in life than to be his wife. To have someone who loves you to that extreme is so rare and he abuses the relationship. What an idiot! Speaking from my own prospective what more can you ask for in life than to have an angel who loves you. Interesting she dies and they have a kid who the other sister has possession and she (the other sister) is bitter because he didn't love her, etc... In the end he gets his daughter back.

3233593,4,B000X7SCQO,"At the end of WWII in Paris, a G.I. (Van Johnson) meets an attractive American (Donna Reed) in a bar but when he meets her sister (Elizabeth Taylor), it's love at first sight. Based on the short story BABYLON REVISITED by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film has been updated from its 1920s ""lost generation"" setting to post WWII Paris. Yet the setting seems wrong because the characters themselves still feel like they walked out of his TENDER IS THE NIGHT. That aside, the film remains a glossy and lush melodrama of a free spirit (Taylor) mismatched with a buttoned down newsman (Johnson, the film's only weak link). Taylor is at her most movie goddess beautiful here and looks terrific in her Helen Rose gowns. In contrast, Reed overdoes the bottled up, resentful sister. The Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein song The Last Time I Saw Paris is lovely but overused in the underscore to the point of distraction. It could use a remake but this time utilizing the original 1920s setting. Directed by Richard Brooks. With Walter Pidgeon, Roger Moore, Eva Gabor, George Dolenz, Kurt Kasznar, Sandy Descher, Celia Lovsky, John Doucette and Ann Codee.

3233596,4,B000X7SCQO,"With some strong performances (Taylor, Pidgeon and Johnson were all Oscar worthy), a two-hanky level storyline (yes, there will be tears) and an effervescent atmosphere created by the otherworldly Paris, `The Last Time I Saw Paris' is a wonderful film that will captivate from start to finish.

The film revolves around a young GI named Charles Wills who happens across a family with two daughters, both ripe for the picking and yet it is the vivacious Helen who steals his heart, much to the disappointment of her sister Marion.  Charles is not rich, but he is handsome and charming and his heart is big enough to swallow Helen whole.  Soon they are married and embarking on a life of love and happiness and a beautiful daughter and eventual struggles and broken trust and mistakes and frustrations and heartbreak.  Yes, life is never easy, and Charles and Helen find that out that hard way when their marriage begins to fray at the seams.  Charles' endeavor to become a published author weighs a heavy burden on his soul as rejection continues to corrode his demeanor, and Helen finds herself lost in a freedom she can't control and her unhappiness bleeds into flirtatious affection-seeking around other men.  With the judgmental eyes of Marion lurking around their every move, and the drunken habits of Helen's father, James, rearing their head in the early morning hours, Charles and Helen completely fall to pieces.

But there is no denying that they are in love.

There are moments within `The Last Time I Saw Paris' that are obvious manipulations, but they are handled with care.  The opening section and the closing are brilliantly conceived, completely powerful and emotionally complex.  There are moments in the film's center that meander a little, and the time shifts are a tad drastic in parts.  Despite the flaws though, this is a really well done film that will grab you and keep you close.  Taylor is fantastic, delivering a `complete' performance.  She starts off carefree and exotic, using her body and her voice to tease the audience (as well as Charles), but as the marriage strain sets in her demeanor changes and she begins to harden.  The way she handles that shift is remarkable.  Even her line readings are spot on (""you far less beat up than you ought to be"").  And then, as she desperately tries to save her marriage you can feel that passion swell inside her; right down to the way she holds her husband's head against her face.  Walter Pidgeon is also great here, comedic gold (he hits every mark), and Donna Reed uses her facial expressions to superb effect.  To me though, this film is all about Van Johnson.  His portrayal of Charles is remarkable.  He bleeds with such emotional frustrations.  As his career collapses you can feel his despair and as he seeks refuge in the arms of a stranger you can feel the guilt rise in his throat.  His soliloquy alone was flawlessly executed (and this is from someone who loathes soliloquies).

And that final act, with his daughter...just wow.

As a whole, the film itself really needed a sharper hand in its center, but the acting alone is so breathtaking that it demands to be seen and lauded.",1318291200,,3166,4.7775735294117645

the company Marengo Films has a dvd that is a double feature--like all of their dvds are--of ""Love Affair"" and ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" and it looks fantastic compared to every other crappy public domain dvd I have seen.
Because of the fact that this film was filmed with the Technicolor process copies of the film often look hopelessly blurry.
even though the Marengo dvd is not perfect, it is far clearer than any other version I have bought.
Marengo Films has many other dvd double features, and while they all might not be the best versions available, anyone looking for public domain titles should always look to see if a Marengo Films dvd version exists.
look for them and ROAN Group.
Those 2 companies are consistently the best from what I can tell after a bunch of trial and error with many companies.

3233602,3,B000X7SCQO,"Updating a story to present day sometimes doesn't work, even with top stars and production values. In the case of this sentimental 1950's drama, everyone seems to be in a different age calling for a different sensibility.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote his short story ""Babylon Revisited"" as a look back on the Jazz Age he knew so well. Paramount was going to film it, but that never happened. Gregory Peck was set to star at one point, but that too didn't materialize. When MGM got ahold of the rights to the story, the studio bosses decided to skip the 1920's in favor of the post-World War II period up to then-present day, says the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com).

To that end, writer-director Richard Brooks took a solid screenplay by the Epstein twins (the guys who helped make ""Casablanca"" a classic) and updated it per studio demands.

""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" isn't a bad movie - Elizabeth Taylor, Van Johnson, Walter Pidgeon and Donna Reed headline - but their characters seem trapped in a pre-Depression Paris mindset rather than the postwar period around them. One good outcome: Elizabeth Taylor later said this ""not so good picture"" helped her to realize she wanted to be an actress and would have to work at it.

Brooks got something out of the experience, too. He realized he needed to get out of MGM if he wanted to do movies his way - writing them and directing them the way he felt they should be done. Such independence would come only by getting out of his contract or by directing a huge hit that would give him leverage at MGM for doing things his way. Fortunately for Brooks, he got that hit with his next movie, ""Blackboard Jungle.""

It's Paris and the War is ending, and can you believe it? Donna Reed and Elizabeth Taylor are sisters! Sounds weird, but works. Liz and Donna have an endearing father, who loves to party and lives like he has money, when in fact he has little. Van and Liz fall in love expressing sweet senitment in lovely and urgent prose, that would only work between young lovers, one a soldier and the other a young beauty, tired of war.

It's fun to get caught up in their blossoming romance and watch their love grow into a trusting relationship, that eventually gives way to some unpleasant moments, brought on by Van's attempts to write the Great American Novel and the sudden and unexpected wealth of Liz's family.

I loved seeing Paris officially light up for the first time after the war, and darling, no one can play a bed-ridden scene like Liz.

3233618,5,B000X7SCQO,"This film is a beautiful achievement about several issues. First about WW2, the liberation of Paris and the role the Americans played in that event. Some Americans stayed behind and made Paris their  capital , their regular living quarters because of the artistic and easygoing atmosphere of the city, because of what they thought was the permanent celebrating calvacade. No surprise that George fell into the trap, married a young beauty and tried to live up to this city. But he failed. And that is the second achievement. It is a perfect love affair and lifelong love for a woman that he idolizes and yet is unable to equal and even to come close to. He fails his own love and he destroys himself in alcohol to forget his failure. She will die because of it, leaving him and their daughter stranded behind. This is a lesson about achieving anything in life : achievement is a lot harder than striving for it, a lot more haphazard and unguaranteed and when the illusion disappears there is nothing left but frustration and selfdestruction. Then George is torn apart by his love for the departed woman, his wife, and his guilt about it, the jealousy of her sister who grabs the daughter and gets a court order to take care of her, and his desire to recuperate his daughter that finds a similar desire in the girl who wants to live with her daddy. The sister will have to realize that she is chastizing him for her own sister's death, for her own rejection as a possible wife and for her incapability to have a child of her own with her own husband. The end of this film is an absolute tear-shedding scene that should rip the heart of any viewer apart. An amazing Elizabeth Taylor is enhancing the film with the art of one of the best actresses of those times.

3233619,5,B000X7SCQO,"Here in The Last Time I Saw Paris an interesting thing happens. Elizabeth Taylor becomes a woman. Before this picture there were really only two other outstanding performances by Miss Taylor. Or I should say where she was allowed to rise above the material. The first being of course the rhapsodic National Velvet and the second the astonishing A Place In The Sun. The films in between those and The Last Time I Saw Paris were mostly along the  ""Isn't she beautiful?"" line of movie making, and, why not?  That was the main engine of most Hollywood star vehicles of the day.  A Star didn't have to be a talent. But it was essential to possess a presence that reached out from the screen and touched the audience in a primal way. Miss Taylor had that in spades but she had much more that was often eclipsed in the dazzling explosion of her extraordinary almost alien beauty.
  But here in the hands of director Richard Brooks (who would later lead her to her triumph in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof) Miss Taylor finds a new level in her abilities as an actress.  Her Helen is a woman of many layers and dark corners, of mercurial flights and deep sadness.  Elizabeth at the tender age of 22 grasps all the aspects of this tragic woman and illuminates not only the screen with them but the whole enterprise as well.  She shows us where she, as an actress is going in the future. And who she will become in her later films, one of the best screen actresses of the twentieth century.  This is the real beginning of the Elizabeth Taylor of legend. She fills the role as no one of her generation could. Never again after this film would she sleepwalk through a film, a beautiful shadow to dream over.
  She is aided in what is perhaps one of Van Johnson's best performances. Donna Reed scores high in the role of Helen's bitter sister and Walter Pidgon is a delight as her roguish father. A standout cameo is presented by Eva Gabor, (not Zsa Zsa) the only one of the famous sisters who had any real talent. The only false performance in the film comes from child actress Sandy Descher. When you compare her forced and overly cute performance to that of the child Elizabeth Taylor in ""Jane Eyre"" then you see what a treasure Miss Taylor has always been.
  There is something so essentially wonderful in this gem from MGM and it is this. The Last Time I Saw Pairs is the perfect example of the last flowering in the 50's of the ""woman's picture"".  Films where women could be multi faceted and complex and drive the story on under their own steam as whole human beings.  This is a window to the 50's and a style of filmmaking that seems gone forever, great stories of strong women who fill the screen with power and grace.  But with ""Far From Heaven"" and ""The Hours"" I may be wrong about forever.
  I recommend this admittedly dated but charming film for anyone who wants to see what screen acting is all about. It is about thinking and Miss Taylor is a master at the craft.",1059609600,,2957,4.404411764705882

Walter Pigeon appears as the eccentric father of the bride and Donna Reed is the older sister who tries to run the family with good sense and is often rebuffed.
When everyone is poor and struggling things hold together but when the family falls into money then everything crashes down.

Walter Pidgeon shambles about as Liz's dad, Donna Reed looks pained and pinched as Liz's sister who sort of lost Van to Liz. Cloying child actress as the daughter of Van and Liz annoying. There's also something about the quality of the film they've been showing on NYC's Channel 13/PBS that makes me wonder whether it was recovered from a safe on the Andrea Doria.
I hope this was ""The Last Time I Saw"" this movie.",997228800,,780,4.416666666666667
3233624,5,B000X7SCQO,"This is a classic not only for its genre but for its stars, Van Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor. A wonderful romantic drama with exquisitely detailed characters. True to the F. Scott Fitzgerald story with haunting performances and musical score. Van Johnson's best performance, unlike anything he's done before or since. Stays with you...Classic story, brilliant acting and something most contemporary movies lack today...originality and the ablility to keep audiences riveted without special effects, violence and other distasteful additions. Take a trip back to Hollywood's Golden Era...",980553600,,586,5.825581395348837
3233625,4,B000X7SCQO,"Elizabeth Taylor has been quoted saying that this is the film that made her want 2 be more than a mere moviestar. It was the first time since Angela Vickers in A Place in the Sun, that she was proud of her work. She  got rave reviews and both her talent and appearance is startling.  I can`t  remember seeing her so natural and good in any other picture.  The film has  been dogged by many critics and has suffered from little reputation. In my  opinion however; THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS is the best Taylor, with A PLACE  IN THE SUN, WHO`S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.  Trivia: ""a viewer from Oslo, Norway"" is in fact me.",961459200,,646,4.153225806451613

8227232,1,B000X7SCQO,"Review of The Last Time I Saw Paris
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

The song The Last Time I Saw Paris actually wasn't written for this movie; the movie was written for the song. How often does that happen? Its a very famous song, and its played countless times throughout the film, mostly to distract the audience from a mediocre story. Van Johnson is torn between traditional Donna Reed and impulsive Elizabeth Taylor. A very tough decision, made even tougher by the circumstances in which he meets Ol Violet Eyes. She grabs him and kisses him on the street during the merriment of VE Day, then flees. No man would choose Donna Reed after that.

The majority of the film isn't a will-they-or-wont-they romantic struggle, which is the movies biggest mistake. After the two lovebirds get together, the audience stops caring. Pitfalls and contrived obstacles befall the couple, and eventually puts the audience to sleep. I know Liz Taylor is beautiful, but there are so many other movies you can watch if you want to see her beauty up on the big screen. Try A Place in the Sun, Cleopatra, Cat on a Hot Tin Roofpretty much any movie besides Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to look at her gorgeous mug. The Last Time I Saw Paris is really bad; Id even go so far as to say its one of the worst Liz Taylor movies out there. Trust me and save yourself.",1500422400,,1344,4.504098360655738

8227236,5,B000X7SCQO,"One of the greatest melodramas from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with excellent performances by Van Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Walter Pidgeon. Accordingly, the AFI nominated this movie, in 2002, as one of the great 100 passionate movies of all time, BUT, that is not the reason I am doing this review. The reason I am doing this review is because, finally, this fabulous movie has been released in great video/audio quality from none other than the greatest studio for great video/audio releases, Warner Brothers. It is not in Blu Ray format, but it is awfully close. BRAVO Warner Brothers.",1481932800,,594,4.95
