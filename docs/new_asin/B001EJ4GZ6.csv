3555172,3,B001EJ4GZ6,Would someone please tell me why there are interviews between each song! This DVD would be 5 star if not for all the interviews!!,1219190400,2,129,4.416666666666667

3555182,5,B001EJ4GZ6,"This is a phenomenal  DVD. I've wanted it since it first came out and I JUST got enough money to order it. I couldn't be more pleased. The quality is OK, I wish it was better but i'm NOT complaining. Adam is amazing and I love the interviews between the songs. It makes it so it's more personal. ORDER IT.",1300060800,,305,4.083333333333333

3555185,5,B001EJ4GZ6,This is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen.  All their hits are there plus a bunch from their latest CD One-X.  The sound and picture quality makes it seem like you're there.  I highly recommend it.  It's a must have for every fan.  If you're not a fan you will be after watching the DVD.  Go get it!,1224720000,,311,3.935483870967742
3555186,2,B001EJ4GZ6,"First off, the live show ""portion"" is execellent.. The audio appeared to be taken from the soundboard, but has nowhere expected bass response..

There are annoying interview type scenes between just about every song (alot like some of the older VHS tapes bands used to put out).. The interview stuff wouldve been 1000 times better if it was seperated into 2 different sections on the DVD",1222560000,,387,4.863636363636363
3555187,5,B001EJ4GZ6,"I went to this concert on March 21st 2008 with my best friend and his girlfriend. I paid for floor tickets for the 3 of us, however you had to prove that you were 16 years of age or older and due to me not having proof I had to switch the 3 tickets for reserved seating. So anyways, with me having to exchange I was unable to see the first band perform (neverset). When I got to the seats I saw that there was a man with a camcorder near me but was unsure about the intentions of it. So, 15 minutes after getting to our seats SEETHER came onto the stage and played an awesome setlist (no jesus christ, truth, fine again, broken ft. Adam Gontier, rise above this, fake it and remedy). SEETHER performed a great show and so I rank SEETHER as 9/10 because they put on a great show but it seemed to me like it could have been alot better. During intermission, I got myself a pop and my best friend's girlfriend got a t-shirt. Next up was Breaking Benjamin (my favorite band) Breaking Benjamin's setlist was as follows (phobia intro, diary of jane, breakdown, until the end, breath, change- Deftones cover with Shawn of Seether and Barry of 3DG, a one minute and 30 second mashup of AC/DC'S ""back in black"" and Korn's ""blind"" and Rage Against The Machine's ""bulls on parade"" and ending with Metallica's ""one"", blow me away, sooner or later, break my fall and so cold) Breaking Benjamin put on a great live show and so I give them a ranking of 10/10 (they were the best band of the night in my opinion). During intermission, I wanted to get a 3 Days Grace poster, so I got in line and when I was close to the front of the line I heard Three Days Grace's intro. I returned to my seat and got to see 3 Days Grace perform the following songs (animal I have become, pain, just like you, let it die, wake up, I hate everything about you, rooster- Alice In Chains cover, riot, get out alive, never too late, scared, gone forever and ended the concert with the song home with one verse from the song Hey Man Nice Shot in the middle of the song). This concert was by far the best concert I have ever been to. If you are a fan of 3 Days Grace I suggest you buy this movie or at the very least go onto youtube and take a look at some of the songs from the dvd. Anyone, who enjoys SEETHER or Breaking Benjamin or 3 Days Grace should definitely go to one of their shows becuase they are all great performers. I hope you guys found this review helpful.",1219708800,,2433,4.167728237791932

8298339,3,B001EJ4GZ6,"Like others may have mentioned, the concert is edited to put in extra bonus footage, but it's a wasted effort. It breaks up the continuity of the concert.  I would love to see the actual concert beginning to end, not a song, then cut to footage, then another song, repeat. Pretty lame IMO. I ended up ripping all the songs to .mp3, but it took some work to remove the audio from the footage, but listening to songs 1-13 without interruptions from ""bonus material"" made it sound more like I was at the concert and a much better experience.

If you're going to rip the songs to .mp3, I recommend ripping all the audio tracks to .wav first, then select where you want each track to start and end, then go ahead and convert that selection to .mp3. It took me a while, but the effort was worth it to me, I'm happy I did.

Even though I had issues with the editing of the DVD, I'm glad I bought it. I now have 13 live tracks for just over $4. You can't beat that.",1377820800,,957,4.162162162162162
