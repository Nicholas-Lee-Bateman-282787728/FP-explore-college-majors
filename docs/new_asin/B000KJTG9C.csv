She was fascinated with the cartoon, so I bought her a dvd for Christmas and she watched it 4 times Christmas Day. It came super fast and she loves it, so I'm happy.",1389225600,,294,4.267857142857143

8157596,4,B000KJTG9C,I enjoyed watching this series of shows featuring Mr. Magoo and his pet. Somehow I could not help but notice the similarities between the voices of Mr. Magoo and his dog. For a moment I thought that their voices were identical.,1357516800,,227,4.560975609756097

8157598,2,B000KJTG9C,"After watching a Magoo short tacked onto our Mr. Magoo's A Christmas Carol disk, my kids were in love with Mr. Magoo!  I shied away from the box-set because reviews complained of censorship that ruined their nostalgia surrounding the cartoon, so I purchased several of these titles, not realizing they were a re-made series from the 70s.  Unfortunately, not funny...not clever...not sharp like the original series.  Boo.  Disappointing!!!",1265414400,5,438,5.397058823529412
