7965731,3,B000069HRP,"Ma Barker's Killer Brood is a treat to watch. Lots of ""shoot-em-up"" and depression era interiors and cars. Far from the truth (as were most biography movies of the day) but the acting is fair (well, actually good for a cheap ganster movie), the story is a good one, and it seemed to actually have a fair-sized budget. I rate the reproduction quality 3 1/2 stars out of 5.  The other 2 movies are just cheap, terrible, poor quality reproductions, and I stopped watching each half way through. The low price is worth it just to get the Ma Barker movie (and only because of the Ma Barker movie).
The DVD did not freeze or skip.",1205280000,5,624,4.379310344827586
