8755366,2,B01DALQ0UY,"I like Sizemore but geesh, this film is just bad.  You can actually see Eric Roberts constantly looking to his right in his first scene and reading the script verbatim while taking to the guy in FRONT of him.  How bad is that?  I read a book about hunting for humans so I thought the movie sounded great.  The film quality is bad, the music is good, I saw the movie for free but I would not recommend spending money on it.",1494460800,,422,4.109756097560975

8755369,1,B01DALQ0UY,"A group of stock brokers hunt people. The FBI is looking for those people. An oriental wants to buy ""quality bodies"" whatever that is.

The film was low budget. Not much ""hunting,"" mostly people laying down in an open field with four guys standing over them with guns. The script was terrible. This is the worst I have seen Sizemore, I don't think he bothered to memorize his lines and just winged it. The soundtrack was bad and the sound was occasionally uneven. Eric Roberts, seen with a gun on the cover, doesn't have one in the film. Not even a little fake one. His role was minor. There is only one vehicle running people down, and we don't see too much of that.

There are better paintball films on U-Tube. The original title was ""Fair Chase"" but there were few chases and I wouldn't use the word, ""Fair."" I believe they changed the title in hopes we would confuse it with better films of the genre.
