8709429,4,B00V7DARUM,"I applaud the Farsight Institute's effort into trying to uncover some of the great mysteries of our time through the use of remote viewing.
At least it is a credible attempt to unravel some of these mysteries that we otherwise don't have definitive proof for.
The army & CIA had a program using remote viewing techniques for 20 yrs. for military gathering information. It is true that the program
was declassified in 1995. We really don't know if some classified remote viewing programs are still going on.
For a program to go on for 20yrs. suggests that remote viewing has real credibility, but may not be best suited for military applications.
To outright suggest that it is preposterous for there to be a city under the face on Mars using remote viewing, because it can't be verified,
doesn't make it a false claim either.
Some might consider the remote viewing techniques to make for boring dvd watching,but the results gotten were most fascinating,I thought.
The gov't doesn't tell it's citizenry everything it knows. We are left with our own devices to find out the truth. Remote viewing may be a way of trying to get at that truth.

resolves the issue of the so-called Face on Mars. We now know that this anomaly
was actually a city where Martians lived."" Seriously? We know nothing of the kind and such inflated remarks do nothing for the advancement of Remote Viewing. Remote Viewing, like any other information gathering tool, whether in journalism or by intelligence gathering bodies, demands validation. Can the information be corroborated by other information gathering means? We have only to look at the huge mistake made regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq because we took the work of one man. When the facts were screaming at us that there were no weapons of mass destruction our government choose to look the other way based on it's own motivations. You NEVER NEVER put all your chickens in one basket based on one source without verification. Since we have not yet journeyed to Mars and examined this anomaly first hand it must remain a mystery. And yes, as one brief review stated, it is boring. Remote Viewing IS an interesting subject and should be pursued but this documentary is a real killer for anyone wanting to make a serious investigation, as are the videos shown at the Farsight Institute.
