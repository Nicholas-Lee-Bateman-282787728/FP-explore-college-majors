8496685,5,B006DF6ZL4,"From the 1978 and 1990 Rockpalast shows in Germany.  I've been a Brood fan since 1978 when I first heard ""Saturday Night"".  This is a great live collection of Herman's songs plus some cover tunes.  Herman left us way too soon and I'm sure he is greatly missed by his many fans.  Both shows are great and each is very unique.  I'll watch them both many times!  This is just a small sample of Herman Brood's awesome talent!  He is a one of a kind and a true rock legend!  What a guy!",1484092800,,481,4.096774193548387

8496687,5,B006DF6ZL4,"Herman Brood is one of Rock's most under appreciated Icons, a man that embodied the Rock 'n Roll life-style and approached the music with a purity that few have.  To be surprised with these legendary live-shows 10 years after his death is a blessing to the existing fans and a proper introduction to those still to fall under his spell.",1340582400,,336,4.6
