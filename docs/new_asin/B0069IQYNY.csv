8495319,1,B0069IQYNY,I can't believe how bad the quality of the DVD is. Not only does the front and back cover look gritty and like a copy of a photo but also the title is slanted; the DVD artwork looks bootlegged and the movie itself is also tiny on my tv screen and is a low quality. I'm not an expert in detecting bootleg DVDs but this sure as hell looks fake.,1517443200,,342,3.9

8495323,5,B0069IQYNY,"This movie really blew me, lots of action and violence. If you liked the anime version of Crying Freeman you will love this live action version of the first episode of the anime. 5 stars.",1439424000,3,187,4.371428571428571
8495324,3,B0069IQYNY,"Good. That's the word that springs to mind after watching this film. It is very stylish and well shot, but just feels like it needed a bit more. It follows the original story ""Portrait of a Killer"" very well, with some very big changes. The action is very entertaining, but there is too much slow-mo in them, making some of them real bore to watch. The acting is decent, with some performances being weak, others good enough. The actor for Yo Hinamora(aka Freeman) was a great choice and plays the character well. The same can be said for the actress playing Emu O'Hara(whose name was changed from Hino to O'Hara for some reason), who looks and sound exactly like the OVA version of the character. The effects are also very good. Overall, a good watch for fan of the manga or OVA series or action movie fan in general, just don't expect too much out of it.",1398556800,2,856,4.45859872611465
