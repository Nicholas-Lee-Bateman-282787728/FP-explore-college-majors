8415986,4,B00448JWBC,A fine 40's film noir.  My only quibble is Kim Hunter's acting.  Apparently all of her acting is done via making her eyes wide and then wider still.,1498780800,,148,4.25

8415990,4,B00448JWBC,"This reviewer favors the original film title-""When Strangers Marry"".  That title squares with the strange relationship between Kim Hunter and her husband, Dean Jagger. Robert Mitchum is in the mix as Hunter's former boyfriend who can't let go. Honors go to Neil Hamilton as a canny and (rightfully) suspicious New York police detective. Alert: There is a murder early in the plot and tension swings back and forth as to the perpetrator. No plot giveaways but pay attention! Geography matters.

""Betrayed""/""When Strangers Marry"" is a solid, fast moving noir/whodunit from 1944. To describe it as ""low budget"" is no insult. This one is easily recommended. And anyone who can explain that final scene on the train is a smart individual! Why was Hunter all by herself?

SPOILER ALERT: As this viewer was composing this review he noticed that the back of the CD box contains a definite story spoiler! Watch WSM before reading!",1428192000,4,921,5.006535947712418

Robert Mitchum is great as always, and Neil Hamilton [Comissioner Gordon from Batman] as a police detective is excellent. Kim Hunter is great as the nave small town girl and Dean Jagger is wonderful as the mysterious husband. No flaws here. You couldn't do better. A+ Film Noir.",1391817600,3,378,4.5588235294117645
