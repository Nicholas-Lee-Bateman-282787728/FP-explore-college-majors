The complete collection is worth buying. The seller shipped the DVDs quicker than I was expecting. I have no complaints whatsoever, this deal is a must for true drama loving fans!!!",1469232000,2,328,4.771929824561403
7741602,1,B01F2EA3R8,The show is good but the picture quality on this version is awful. It is very jumpy and distracting. Adds for Hyundai and Subway pop up during the credits and a yellow 15 symbol pops up in the upper right from time time. It looks like someone recorded it off of television and burned it onto DVD at a bad compression rate. Disappointing. I wish I bought a better version.,1468886400,,371,4.314285714285714
7741603,5,B01F2EA3R8,"There are many K-Dramas that try a multi-genre format but only a very few are even moderately successful. DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN is one such success. This 16 episode series was a blockbuster hit in South Korea and China. It was so influential in China that the Chinese Politburo felt it necessary to warn the under twenty-five viewing audience about what it deemed the pernicious influence of the film's ubiquitous and unabashed admiration of Western-style capitalism. Directors Lee Eung-bok and Baek Sang-hoon combined to present a tightly controlled fusion not only of disparate genres but also of equally disparate themes. The genres ranged from political drama to domestic drama to romance and to high and low comedy. The themes were equally diverse: military loyalty to the state, military loyalty of the rank and file, corrosive solidarity in the civilian/military workplace, conflicting familial loyalty of father/son, father/daughter, boyfriend/girlfriend, and internecine quarrels between civilian and military leadership. One could be forgiven for thinking that such a union of various genres and themes would be unwieldy at best, but as one watched the totality of the series in sequence, one could sense that the willing suspension of disbelief that is the norm on both the screen and stage need hardly be suspended at all.

  At the core of the plot is a trio of intertwined relationships. Yoo Si-jin (Song Joong-ki) is a captain in South Korea's Alpha Special Forces Defense Unit. He is a superbly trained and efficient soldier who knows when to kill and when not to. He is boyishly handsome and likes to clown around when not busy defending the state. He meets and quickly falls in love with Dr. Kang Mo-yeon (Song Hye-kyo) a dedicated surgeon who is still single in her thirties. She is drop-dead gorgeous and totally unafraid to vent her spleen on those who incur her ire. In one wickedly funny scene, her boss orders her to visit him for an illicit quickie in his office. She responds by knocking him flat with a well-placed punch. Captain Yoo and Dr. Kang trade barbs but their attraction is mutual. But despite their best efforts to begin a serious romance, he is all too often called away by his commanding officer to be whisked away to far-flung battlefields where his safe return is never a guarantee. The second relationship is also between a soldier and a doctor. Sgt. Seo Dae-young (Jin Goo) is also a member of South Korea's Alpha team. Unlike his close friend Captain Yoo Si-jin, Sgt. Seo Dae-young is deadly serious about life in general. To him life is black-and-white, at least it was until he meets First Lieutenant Yoon Myung-ju (Kim Ji-won) a doctor who has long standing issues with Dr. Kang. Sgt. Seo Dae-young is astonished at how strongly Dr. Yoon Myung-ju pursues him. He loves her but fears to tell her so mostly because her father is a three star general who absolutely forbids the couple from marrying. The third relation is between the two male leads. They bond on such a multiplicity of levels that several reviewers unfairly refer to their connection as a bromance. They learn to count on each other in lethal situations. They also learn to tread carefully on the byzantine pathways that mark the South Korean military mindset. And while all this back-watching is going on, they support each other as each recognizes that their respective love affairs must somehow factor into how they must juggle their personal and professional lives.

  It is not only the superb acting of the leads that invests DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN with a non-stop vitality but some stunning cinematography of various locales further insures an ""oohing"" and ""ahhing"" of the viewer. Further, the supporting cast admirably adds to cinema veritee. Of particular note is the powerfully understated performance of Lieutenant Ahn Jung-joon (Ji Seung-hyun) , of the North Korean People's Army who is introduced as the implacable foe of Captain Yoo Si-jin.  Oddly enough even their combat with bayonets is marked by a savage respect for their respective abilities.  Lieutenant Ahn Jung-joon appears conveniently at critical points to suggest that even for trained killers like himself and Captain Yoo Si-jin political ideology must take second place to basic human feelings. What emerges after watching the totality of the series is the unshakeable feeling that DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN is one of the most gripping movies ever to come out of Korea.",1468454400,7,4456,5.020297699594046
7741604,1,B01F2EA3R8,This version suffers from picture quality issues since everything was squeezed on 3 discs. It also freezes at some spots and again probably because it's only 3 discs.

A love story between a doctor and soldier with war scenes, funny moments and moments where you are at the edge of your seat.
