2833031,5,B000Q73C2U,"I recently bought this item. It has dual language options, so it's in both Japanese and English. I haven't watched every single episode, but I've watched most of them, including those on the last disc, so I say it's a pretty safe assumption to say that every episode has the dual language option. Some discs do start automatically in Japanese, but it can be switched to english in the setup menu. The video quality is great, and it has all the episodes plus the 4 movies. Each disc contains about 2 volumes of the regular Inuyasha dvds. There are 9 dvd cases, each with 3 discs, so a total of 27 discs for the series, 29 including the movies. There are also menus, scene selection, and chapters for every episode. Which I wasn't expecting therefore was pleasantly surprised with. The scene selections also include the episode titles. (which aren't included on the dvd cases, or boxes.)

**Edit** I can now officially say all the episodes are in english, all of the episodes have been watched. Like I said before the episodes that start in Japanese can be switched to english. Also, on the back of one of the cases, it looks like a couple episodes are missing, because it jumps ahead like three or so, but no worries the episodes are actually on the disc.",1211673600,8,1254,4.573333333333333

Do not be confused by the second season cover image! All eight seasons, including the four full-length films, were included. I will go through this seller again if there is anything else I am looking to purchase on Amazon in the future.""",1204502400,4,398,4.391891891891892
2833033,5,B000Q73C2U,"*SUMMARY:

I received all the tv episodes and all the movies. Each was excellent dvd quality and had the option for either english or japanese audio. The set can be English the whole way through, or Japanese with english subtitles if you preffer. This is the complete definitive set for Inuyasha Fans, you will not be dissapointed. There was a lack of any real bonus features, but with this much entertainment I wasn't too upset about it. In fact my only peeve was that the discs are not clearly labeled and can be confusing if not kept in the original case (I use an automated dvd index).

PROS:
-Complete Series And All Movies
-Excellent Quality
-The option to switch between English and Japanese
-Complete Series has English Audio Language
-Clear Easy to read subtitles with correct spelling and grammar. (major anime buffs will appreciate this when watching with japanese voices)

CONS:
-Lack of bonus content.
-Discs are not labelled clearly and are easy to mix up.

OVERALL:
This is the must have set for any Inuyasha fan and one of the few with english voiceovers the whole way through. There is simply no better way to enjoy Inuyasha.

If you are an Inuyasha fan and want the entire series this is a great buy. it has episodes 1 - 167 plus the four movies.

2833035,5,B000Q73C2U,I bought this and it came in new with shrink wrap.  I got the whole seriers (167 ep) and the four movies.  This is a wonderful anime series and would say everyone should watch it!,1200528000,25,179,4.085714285714285
2833040,5,B000Q73C2U,"First of let me get the item review out of the way, its gonna be fast and to the point without giving away much of the story, I love Inu-Yasha, it was one of the first full anime series I watched after a long dry spell when I was younger..pretty much nothing between watching Robotech and when Inu-yasha started playing on Adult Swim... Inu Yasha takes place duelly in modern era and fuedal Japan, it is the storie of a Junior High girl named Kagome who as it turns out is a reincarnation of a powerful shrine princess named Kikyo(sp?) Well Kagome falls into an ancient well at her families shrine and is transported back into Fuedal Japan where she meets Inu Yasha, a half-demon who happened to have been pinned to a tree by Kikyo by a sealing spell just before she died, and learns that the Jewel of four souls that Kikyo was protecting from the demons is inside her body, at least for the first few minutes...until its bitten out by a demon centipede, and that she now has the duty of protecting the jewel...but she accidently shatters it trying to save it from a demon crow and the mulitude of shards fly off in all directions. Thus begins the journey to find the shards before they all fall into the wrong hands, because ya see apparently one shard of the jewel will increase a demons power exponentially, and of course along the way they gather friends and fight demons and develop romances. Overall an anime I thouroghly enjoyed.

  Now then....I purchased this item and gave the seller (HenryHoang) a good review because the shipping was fast and well packaged, however, the discs are pirated copies and you can't skip the opening on most of the dics, also there are episodes missing from the series and if you watch the whole thing through you will notice the parts where episodes are skipped, so far it has happened to me on at least 3 of the disc changes. The seller clearly states that these are not illegal copies and that they are from the manufacturing company but that is an outright lie. These discs are obviously pirated copies, my suggestion to you is don't waste the money, its just too much to pay for missing episodes and a pirated bootleg series. Also I want to point out that the Seller contacted me several times about giving him a review before I got the discs and then was upset when I only gave him 4 stars because of the fact that I could tell when I got them that they were pirated.",1246924800,8,2412,4.4401805869074495

There is an option to watch in Japanese and English with subtiltles for both which I really enjoy.  Most of the dics start in Japanese, but that can be changed under set-up.  I got this for an unbelievable price and I strongly recommend purchasing this item, and if possible, from the seller I used.

All the episodes. (1-167) 9 dvd's,27 disks,three boxes.

The four movies

The soundtrack to movie 2.

Con's:

disks can be easy to lose if you don't keep them all together (with thier dvd case) since they are all almost labled 'Disk 1' 'Disk 2' 'Disk 3'

2833045,5,B000Q73C2U,"I bought this series because Adult Swim shifted the show to 5:00 am in the morning. I wanted to see it at a decent hour.  I have no problem with there being no extras.  My DVD player doesn't always let opne the extras menu, or if it does I can't shift from extra to another.  I got all 167 episodes, plu the four movies and a music cd.  With no extras, I get nine episodes a disc, instead  of the usual 3-5 episodes a disc.  The price at $175.00 was good price.  My only problem is I nw have 2 copies of Inuyasha movie no. 3.

It was spectacular came with all the tv series and all 4 movies i was very pleasently suprised that at this price it came in the real boxing and that it was English or Japenese aduio and had also English and Japenese subtitles. I was fully expecting to have to watch it in English subtitles for this price which is far lower than the $400+ you would spend buying them individually and thats from Amazon LLC without shipping and handling and assuming you bought all the movies in the box set of them! I can't find one thing to complain about this box set, it even came with the soundtrack  for the fourth movie (Though i didn't really use this much gave at quick listen to and took some of the songs for my iPod but still). I will definitly look into buying from infomercial_productions again (There the ones i bought mine from there were a couple of others but i just picked that one at random).",1226707200,3,1011,4.321052631578947
2833048,5,B000Q73C2U,"Review updated 9/16/2009
 Inuyasha is one of my four favorite anime series and deserves the five star rating it usually earns. Other reviews will tell you about the story. This review is intended to tell only about the complete box set Inuyasha TV Series Collections (1-8) and why the one that I bought is NOT a bootleg (bootleg means a pirated, unauthorized, illegal copy). The image in the upper left corner of the first page is nowhere to be found on my copy of Inuyasha. It came in three box sets, each with three dvd cases. Each dvd case contains three dvds. There are a total of 167 episodes. There is also a dvd case with all four movies on two discs. All dvds, each dvd case and the box set boxes have copyright warnings, something never seen on bootlegs.

 I've never seen a bootleg that had picture and sound as good as the authorized copy. When compared to Volume 1 purchased directly from Amazon, with episodes 1-3 on a single disc, I can't see any difference in picture quality or hear any difference in sound quality. I'm watching it on my 19"" computer monitor, de-interlaced and up-converted to 1400 x 900. Since my monitor is less than 2 feet away, I assume the picture is about the same quality as a big screen HDTV at a normal viewing distance. Give or take some. I'm listening to Inuyasha on a pair of audiophile grade headphones (the latest version of Beyerdynamics DT-880) driven by a similar quality headphone amplifier (Headroom Micro Amp with the optional circuitry upgrade). Except for a lack of deepest bass and an inability to annoy neighbors a block or more away , that should sound about the same as if you spent as much for your speakers, preamplifier and amplifier as you did for your car. I've never found a bootleg that didn't have at least a few video or audio defects. This shows no signs whatsoever of being a bootleg.

 You can go into the dvd menu or use the dvd player remote to switch from Japanese to English dialog, or to turn the English subtitles on or off. Bootlegs sometimes have closed captions, but never switchable dialog and subtitles.

 This box set is NOT a bootleg. The only downside I can see to buying this box set is the red-rimmed eyes with bags under them that you'll get from watching too many episodes at once, and getting too little sleep. I speak from personal experience. Buy and enjoy. FYI, my other fav series are Cowboy Bebop, FLCL and Samurai Champloo. I've only watched the first few episodes of Black Lagoon so far. It could be #5 on my list.

 I wish that the few reviewers who bought bootleg copies would tell us who sold it to them so we could avoid those sellers. I bought my non-bootleg authorized copy from (wait for it) donutshop. Really. No kidding. I've got written proof. So where are these bootlegs coming from? Name some names, people. Don't label all sellers dishonest because some are. Name the sellers of bootlegs.",1221436800,2,2898,4.5576923076923075

I love the Inuyasha series,but the fact that so many people make bootlegs of it pisses me off. I gave this one star because it is clearly and obviously a bootleg. If I were rating the series itself, I would have given it 4 stars. First off, I am a huge Inuyasha fan and I know for a fact that the entire series hasn't been officially released in a pack ever. Second, the cover, if you look closely, is the same box cover for the official Season 2 box set. It even still says Season 2 on it.
