7809343,3,6301007832,"This is now a more obscure little film, written by Clive Barker. The story centers around a young prostitute that is kidnapped by a group of mutants who are hooked on a mind expanding drug created by a sinister doctor. She is kidnapped because, though she has taken the drug, she exhibits none of the symptons which are basically, face disfigurements. Meanwhile those that have marketed the drug are out to kill the mutants that live below the city in order to exterminate the evidence of thier crimes. Mutants versus the Gangsters basically.
This film is not really a horror film. The mutants are simply people that have been tricked and wronged into mutations. The bad guys are simply gangster who are not very sinister or even menacing for that matter. This film is more of a moral drama than it is a horror film.
The idea for this film was originaly going to be used for a music video and this film is actualy a lot like a music video with its colorful lighting and synth music in the backround.
This fails miserably as a horror film but does have a an excellent touch of surrealism  to it that can't be ignored. The acting is actualy quite good and the idea behind it is also good. On the whole I would recommend this not to horror fans but to Barker fans only.",1063670400,8,1266,4.4334763948497855
