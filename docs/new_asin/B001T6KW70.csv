8340632,2,B001T6KW70,"The artist, techniques, and advice was GREAT. I have been an art instructor for over twenty years and I was VERY impressed with the artist and his art. (Very down to earth, not fake or flaky) however, I rated the DVD with only two stars because my disc didn't play properly right out of the package. First viewing there was a lot of ""jumping"", second viewing (yes you will watch more than once:-) I had to just remove the disc as it was ""playing"" so badly. Hope this helps.",1374537600,,473,4.325842696629214

Just wish it was a little more recent....How about a new one, love to see how you improved, like the difference between your first sector 9 board and new one's you show on video. Still really enjoyed it.",1297728000,2,413,6.961538461538462

8340635,5,B001T6KW70,"This DVD shows how easily you can customize your stuff - just about anything can be painted with water-based paint pens!  Canvas Shoes, surfboards, skateboards, snowboards, guitars, motorcycles, even your car.  The DVD shows how to prepare the surface, lay out the design, blend the colors (water-based paint pen colors blend very well) and in the end how to seal it so it never comes off.  You can really have fun with this!",1226880000,2,425,4.794520547945205
8340636,5,B001T6KW70,"Drew's instruction is easy to follow and the tips make painting with paint pens easy and rewarding. Drew shows you from start to finish how quickly you can paint with the pens and make it look great. My own surfboard paintings went from two color 2D cartoons to multi-colored 3D masterpieces that my friends can hardly believe I did.

I highly recommend this video for anyone that has an artistic itch!",1226534400,4,402,4.661971830985915
