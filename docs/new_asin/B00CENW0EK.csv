8581012,5,B00CENW0EK,"BBC videos like this one come with bonus episodes! This is a very good, interesting documentary from their ""Natural World"" series, and it includes a bonus episode, ""Shark Coasts"" about sharks around the western and eastern sides of Africa's southern tip (it's amazing how different they are!!), and this episode happens to be narrated by David Attenborough.
These smaller BBC releases don't seem to be promoted or advertised, but anyone who has enjoyed their mega series like ""Planet Earth"", ""Wild Pacific"", ""Africa"", and the like will also enjoy these.",1405382400,6,553,5.224719101123595
