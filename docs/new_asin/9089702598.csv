1173031,5,9089702598,"This is a great video for just relaxing and watching the ocean - I find the waves are beautiful and powerful, yet somehow calming too. I love that you can choose the background accompaniment. I'm not really a huge fan of classical music, so to have the choice to go with the natural sound is perfect for me! I own many of World Nature's video and this is one of my (MANY) favorites. I need to comment on the photography as this company ALWAYS does a great job with that - this video is no exception. I would expect nothing less with Tony Helsloot's company.",1455321600,,557,4.314285714285714

1173040,5,9089702598,"Very relaxing video. You can sit back & see & listen to the sound of the waves or you can have it playing classical music, which I love. Very nice after a stressful day or anytime you want to sit back & dream of being at the ocean.

1173041,5,9089702598,This DVD was exactly what we had in mind-beautiful ocean scenes with a choice of natural sound or wonderful accompanying classical music. We have a site in Florida near the ocean but without a view so we plan to have this playing in our RV a lot!!!,1415318400,,248,4.297872340425532

1173046,5,9089702598,Nice product,1412985600,,12,5.5
1173047,5,9089702598,"This DVD is wonderful, very relaxing as background while I read or sew, and it is mesmerizing when I stop to watch. As is the ocean. It is so effective that I can almost smell and taste the saltwater air.

The automatic replay for each segment is an excellent feature.

I have also purchased a couple DVDs as get well cards for ocean loving friends about to undergo surgeries with extended recovery periods.

I could do without the classical music segment and bypass it. The music that plays at the beginning of the demo is not what is on the DVD, or at least not at the beginning of the segment. The demo music has a surreal, dreamy quality about it that I do find very appealing. But, I simply prefer the actual nature sounds.

I am very pleased with this product, and will buy more of these as gifts as situations arise. I will watch for a music-free version.

I can highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys the sight and sounds of the ocean.",1409961600,,952,4.3559322033898304
1173048,4,9089702598,Very much exactly what I wanted--sound of waves crashing on shore. Very calming and lends itself to meditation.,1407110400,,111,5.222222222222222
1173049,5,9089702598,Definitely the DVD to buy if you want to avoid beach traffic . Just put it in your DVD player press start and you're at some of the most beautiful beachs in the world and  you never have to leave your living room.,1406764800,,213,3.953488372093023
1173050,4,9089702598,Beautiful scenes can be viewed with either music or natural wave sounds.  Almost as good as being there.,1406678400,,104,4.777777777777778
1173051,5,9089702598,"SO WONDERFUL AND SO RELAXING........YOU WON'T BE SORRY IF YOU BUY THIS DVD WITH THE OCEAN WAVES AND SEA SOUNDS..........A WONDERFUL WAY TO RELAX AND UNWIND FROM A BUSY DAY:)))))))))  THANK YOU, AMAZON:)))))))))",1405814400,,210,5.363636363636363
1173052,5,9089702598,Everyone has a different expectation when they purchase this type of DVD.  In my opinion the only thing missing from this one is the sea spray.  the scenes are diverse and beautiful.  I purchased this for my wife who is recovering from cancer surgery.  We grew up near the ocean and can't be away from it for too long.  This helped to make her feel as though she was sitting with her feet in the sand.  The only way to improve would be to add more scenes.  Thanks.,1400544000,,464,4.204545454545454
1173053,5,9089702598,Remember I' be brought dvd's from you before. You are my piece of mind when I need it. You have shown through your work just how beautiful the world really is.

We have a Christian ministry and this DVD will be a lead into our
Bible seminar classes.  Thanks.",1393804800,,168,4.758620689655173
1173055,5,9089702598,This is just a gorgeous DVD and the quality is fantastic. I don't know what the other negative reviewers watched but it ain't the same as mine for sure! Great to relax by (I like the classical selection so it is all about taste I guess) and the whole thing is different and well produced. I buy lots of ambient stuff. This is excellent.,1387497600,,336,4.265625
1173056,5,9089702598,Very nice images and sound quality.  Will be really nice when I get a larger television for viewing now.  What a great excuse for a 50 inch television!,1386028800,,151,4.357142857142857
1173057,5,9089702598,"Great video of ocean waves, nature at its best.  DVD production is excellent.  Very relaxing, highly recommended.  I really enjoy watching this, or listening to the ocean waves around the house.  Five stars.",1381190400,,207,5.181818181818182
1173058,4,9089702598,"I like this DVD a lot - I deleted one star only because I don't care for the sunrise to sunset theme.  When I am working at home, I like to have these kind of videos on.  I find them relaxing and they help bring a little bit of nature inside. When the DVD takes me to the beach early morning or during the evening, I find that the energy level is a little too low for working.  Not a major issue though as those sections don't last very long.  I find this company really understands what I am trying to accomplish with these videos.  Very easy to continuously loop and you don't have to listen to music, but can listen to the actual sound of the beach or whichever habitat you're in, which is sometimes hard to find.",1380412800,,716,4.122302158273381
1173059,5,9089702598,I use this DVD to help with insomnia-it works! In winter I have a fireplace DVD  but this oceans are more appropriate when it is warm,1376611200,,133,4.115384615384615

1173062,2,9089702598,"I have a 48"" HD TV, with a Pioneer audio system, and a Blu-ray DVD player.  I am used to crisp video & audio.  I found this DVD to be less than acceptable.  In fact I didn't even watch 10 minutes of it.  It may be my system, but I couldn't recommend this.",1369872000,,255,3.7547169811320753
1173063,5,9089702598,"A very relaxing dvd, if you love being by the ocean & the sound of the waves you'll like this dvd.",1361923200,,98,3.7142857142857144
1173064,1,9089702598,"I read all the reviews and was so excited to relax with this dvd....it is broken down into 3 different sections, the first has some really horrible classical music (they should have used something new age that actually fit with the ocean waves) and it plays over the top of the visuals...so no soft music with the ocean in the background. ugh. the second one is natural sounds, but the backgrounds are all reds and oranges that are not soothing visually...and only a tiny bit of afternoon blues before going back to vibrant reds again. the final one is a static shot that is actually okay, it just plays on a continuous loop, but at least it is blue skies and ocean waves. Really wish I hadn't spent the money. I bought 2 others by him, I hope they are better...",1361923200,,762,4.411347517730497
1173065,2,9089702598,"See the picture of the HUGE wave?  There are zero waves like this in the video.  The waves merely lap to the shore.  I wanted big huge waves, not laps or trickles.",1359936000,,163,4.03125
1173066,1,9089702598,I was amazed that this DVD only lasts 18 minutes.  I can`t see awarding this more than one star.  Also the 18 minute video simply repeats and there doesn`t seem to be anything else on the disc.  In sum I`m very disappointed.  I doubt that I`ll be ordering any more  Tony Helsloot DVDs..,1356048000,,286,4.320754716981132
1173067,5,9089702598,"I bought it to mask the TV sounds from the other room and to relax. It does both admirably. You can put this on a rotation, so it will go endlessly. As relaxing as watching a fish tank, with more soothing sounds.",1349049600,,212,4.071428571428571

I AM NOT A RELAXATION PERSON. TOO BUSY TO TAKE TIME TO TRULY UNWIND.  BUT THIS OCEAN WAVES DVD IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE YET TO PURCHASE.  THE SCENERY IS BREATHTAKING, DOESNT EVEN SEEM REAL.  THESE PEOPLE TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD TO CAPTURE THESE SPECTACULAR MOMENTS OF THE OCEANS.  IT IS GLORIOUS.  REALLY GETS ME IN TOUCH WITH THE CREATOR.",1330128000,,488,6.0144927536231885

1173070,5,9089702598,"All I wanted was a DVD of the ocean, with natural movement and accompanying ocean sounds.  So I started searching, found this production company with Tony Helsloot and Liz Jones, and have been buying their DVD's ever since.  They produce absolutely professional and gorgeous video of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Their ocean videos are becoming my favorite gift, especially for those times when you just can't actually get to a beach.  Very soothing and relaxing.  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying DVD's from these talented professionals!",1324252800,,546,5.241379310344827
