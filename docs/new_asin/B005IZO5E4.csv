4710689,5,B005IZO5E4,I enjoyed the photography and narrative of this film. At least the YF-23 has a documented place in aviation history,1362355200,,115,4.8
4710690,4,B005IZO5E4,"I've always loved ""fast"", so naturally I love fighter jets.  Hearing and seeing the story from this view was really cool.  I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys seeing how humans accomplish truly great things.",1360800000,,223,5.0
4710691,3,B005IZO5E4,Wanted to know more on the technology of the jet. Since its declassified I was thinking it will show some of the secrets that made it different but was lacking.,1358553600,2,160,4.366666666666666
4710692,4,B005IZO5E4,"A heartbreaking tail that was the beginning of the end for McDonnell Douglas.  I was reluctant to purchase this at first since it was a DVD-R, however it was worth it.  I gave it four stars because you can see fuzz on the left and right edges on occasions.  That said, this is a very good documentary for the aviation enthusiasts.",1356480000,3,330,4.377049180327869
4710693,4,B005IZO5E4,"I knew of the YF-23 but I didn't realize it had been in direct competition against the YF-22. It's an absolutely amazing aircraft. It's too bad only the military can build stuff like this and such a great plane was scrapped. It may have been simply the lack of existing footage of the craft, but I was disappointed we didn't see even more of it's flight capabilities.",1354752000,,367,4.492537313432836
4710694,5,B005IZO5E4,Thought provoking too bad the Government did not acquire it. Did someone got a kick back? It reminds me about the flying wing by Nothrop.,1354579200,,137,4.52
4710695,4,B005IZO5E4,"Content:

Absolutely Fantastic. If you are a fighter jet/ aviation fanatic like me, you WILL love this documentary. It is amazing to see how dedicated the men and women working on this secret project were. They accomplished the task of designing and testing the most advanced fighter jet aircraft ever seen. The more it is heartbreaking to see how politics and other factors led to the government to choose the competition.

Presentation:

Here's the reason it only gets 4 stars out of 5. If you watch this video on anything else but a handheld device or a reduced sized window on a computer you will be disappointed by the resolution and image quality of the video. I really wish it was available in HD.

Overall:

A fantastic story worth watching/owning in a not up to standard presentation.",1344211200,,793,4.759124087591241
4710696,3,B005IZO5E4,"A decent review of the ATF and the work that the people at Northrop put into their entry, the YF-23.  Although I have had a life long interest in aviation, I am not well versed on the YF-23, which is probably due to some degree to the fact that there is still secrecy surrounding parts of the ATF program.  This documentary likewise did not seem to reveal anything particularly detailed technically.  It spends a fair amount of time on the larger ATF program, and then on the Northrop people involved with the YF-23 and their dedication to the project.  The video and images, though, of the YF-23 in flight were very nice to see.  For my taste, it would have been better if there were another half hour or so of material to explore more details about the aircraft.",1341619200,11,764,4.467625899280575
4710697,5,B005IZO5E4,"This is a very good documentary dedictaed to the everyone's choice of ATF competitiion.

Very descriptive dvd, great for state of the art aviation fans.

a must have",1165795200,3,165,4.857142857142857
4710698,4,B005IZO5E4,"Pretty good doc on a great plane.  If you read the specs and faceoff between this plane and the f-22, you'll.  But,  wonder why the USAF bought the f-22, but it'!s politics",1384128000,3,172,4.3125
4710699,5,B005IZO5E4,I was priviledged to see this aircraft at the USAF museum at Wright Patterson AFB. I was also a TSGT in the USAF when the flyoff occured. If your interested in how an aircraft is designed and makes it to a fly off this is the DVD for you.,1383177600,,238,3.877551020408163
4710700,5,B005IZO5E4,"even if this plane was not selected as our front line fighter, it should have been taken as a medium range bomber/interceptor.",1379030400,,126,4.7727272727272725
4710701,5,B005IZO5E4,"Every contract has a winner, but this shows that second isn't always not as good. The plane can be found on u tube for anyone wanting to know what this documentary is about, but for an in depth review, this is what you want.",1378684800,,224,4.113636363636363
4710702,3,B005IZO5E4,Another one were I was hoping to see more secrets.  I guess declassified wasn't really classified to begin with.  Hmmm.,1375920000,,119,4.9
4710703,4,B005IZO5E4,Learnt some details about YF-23 future fighter. Exciting documentary for me. Though wanted more than just shorter than 1 hour.,1373846400,,126,5.35
4710704,4,B005IZO5E4,"When I bought this dvd I didn't know what to expect because there is so little in the way of documentaries on the YF-23
available to the public. I was pleasantly surprised with this documentary though!

It starts out discussing the need for the ATF during the Cold War. This footage is really the only ""old"", Cold War vintage
footage of fighters and air defenses. The rest of the footage and content is from the late 1980s to 1990. It then covers
the design, development  and the decisions made by Northrup in creating the YF-23. Displaying and talking about as much as
can be declassified. The ""Rollout"" and flight test program at Edwards AFB are well covered.

The interviews with engineers, program managers, technicians and test pilots were all informative and covered topics and
technology that I hadn't seen before. There are areas where they were not able to talk about, like the performance data
on the flight testing of the YF-23 that are still classified. This documentary presents as about as much as possible on
what is declassified about the YF-23 program. The footage on the flight testing is towards the end of the program and
most of it I had not seen before. I also like the explanation of the origin of the red bow tie on the bottom of the test planes.

This is a good documentary on the YF-23 for the aviation enthusiast, anyone who worked on the YF-23 program and the
person looking for more information on the YF-23. Until this documentary was available for sale, I had not found anything
specifically on the YF-23. I plan to keep as part of my collection. It ends with a discussion on the fate of the two
prototypes and the efforts to restore one of the prototypes for display. This documentary was created in 2000 and later
sold to the public. I consider the YF-23 to be significant because it is one of the few true stealth fighters to have been
built. Today, there stealth fighters being built in Russia and China. Stealth technology has been applied to the latest
European fighter but here you get to see footage of a true stealth fighter being designed, built and flight tested.

I gave this documentary a four because the production of the program wasn't quite as good as other documentaries I have seen.
That said, I would still rate the production as good, just not the best I have seen. I consider this documentary on the YF-23
program to be worth the price and a good addition to the aviation enthusiast's collection!",1372982400,,2449,4.6336405529953915
4710705,2,B005IZO5E4,This is a documentary on the contest between two companies vying for the right to manufacture the next generation of advanced fighter aircraft for the US and its allies. Unfortunately it is primarily about the F-23 and does not include much of the winner the F-22. It is also about the people who worked on the plane and not very much about the plane itself. There is no head to head comparisons of the two planes and what is revealed is five of six years old. Not much to see or learn from this turkey.,1369180800,,503,4.3052631578947365
4710706,5,B005IZO5E4,"I very much enjoy reading about the genius of aeronautical engineers, bravery of  test pilots and the aptitude of pilots of new-age flight. The beauty of an F-15, the Blackbird, or the F-117 stealth fighter, are awe inspiring and just short of miraculous for me. I wish the best for my country and this  includes the continued development of the best military and equipment imaginable.
Long live the Skunk Works and like minded professionals.",1363651200,,442,4.95945945945946
4710707,1,B005IZO5E4,"I have not been able to watch this show in its entirety because the video stream keeps encountering technical problems. Despite trying 4 different times this problem persists.

A rare but well deserved ""F"" for Amazon.com in this case...",1362873600,,236,5.051282051282051

8475280,5,B005IZO5E4,We should have bought the 23,1405728000,,28,3.8333333333333335
8475281,5,B005IZO5E4,Great documentary on the plane that SHOUT have won/been built. Dirty lobbyists and pentagon officials and military brass ruined a company and built the 2nd best plane. Great documentary about it though,1404259200,,201,5.3125
8475282,5,B005IZO5E4,"pretty much summed up everything I wanted to know about the black widow, wish it had more of a comparison to the raptor, but im not complaining, good stories of the people who build the widow",1403222400,,191,4.333333333333333
8475283,3,B005IZO5E4,"Much more about the ""story"" than about the aircraft, but I suspect details of the actual flight performance is buried - primarily because as an invisible stand off air superiority design it was vastly superior to the F22 (which they say won due to dogfight maneuverability and a more aggressive demonstration program).  Defeats the whole purpose of the plane, I know all about what happened in Vietnam when the F4 had no guns, but you really never want any of your fighters in a knife fight in today's world.  Air superiority BVR. That's it. Then complement with ground attack or multi role.

So while it provided some footage of the YF23 (I am desperate to see more), not near enough!",1387497600,,685,4.691666666666666
8475284,5,B005IZO5E4,"Loved it!!! Very informative, and well covered story. I loved the skyline vies & loved the cockpit views as well.",1386633600,,113,4.7
8475285,5,B005IZO5E4,"This documentary is an outstanding look into the competitive nature and complex design process of building modern military jets. Yes, many aspects of the jets top performance are classified and will be for a long time (along with the F-22) since it is currently the best technology out there and we don't want that as common information. Anyone interested in military-contract aeronautical engineering, the design and competition process, and test-pilot/engineer development will love this relatively short film.",1385942400,,512,5.662337662337662
