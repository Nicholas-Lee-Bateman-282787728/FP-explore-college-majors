8289913,5,B001CU99FO,"Excellent History and photography.  It was interesting to learn about the Roman Rules - how the Catacombs were constructed, and the conflicts between the Pagans and the Christians.  Also learning that they adopted Mythology - and that some of them met their death at the Circus or the Colosseum.  Their artwork is excellent and how they had the artwork of the Good Shepherd.  Also very interesting is that they became saints.",1401148800,,425,4.943661971830986
