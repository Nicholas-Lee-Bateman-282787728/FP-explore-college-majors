8484546,1,B005S2RIAK,"I was very disappointed with this product as it was not what it was advertised as. I thought I was buying the Alone on the Wall DVD, NOT a 13 minute interview about it! Very misleading, especially given the price.",1358726400,4,213,4.35

8484548,2,B005S2RIAK,"I watched the 60 Minutes episode of ""Alone on the Wall"" when it aired and thought this DVD would have some other footage or coverage but to my dismay it really is just the 13 minute aired episode. The story still is pretty amazing if you haven't seen it but not worth the price for a 13 minute segment. There is also a National Geographic video on their website which is also called ""Alone on the Wall"" which documents Alex Honnold's story.",1331251200,5,440,4.378048780487805

8484550,1,B005S2RIAK,"If you are looking for the Alex Honnold National Geographic video ""Alone On A Wall""-- this is not it! This is a 13 minute video that aired on 60 Minutes in October 2011. That said, it is an awesome 13 minutes.",1326326400,11,209,4.121951219512195
