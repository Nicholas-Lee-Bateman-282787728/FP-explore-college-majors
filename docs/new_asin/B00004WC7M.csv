7924987,3,B00004WC7M,"This is a road movie with a twist.  Instead of two buddies we have a woman running away from her life and the cabbie she hires to take her to the desert.
There is a natural antagonism between the two that soon becomes romantic tension, as the two talk.
Hannah(Barbara Hershey) is clearly a wounded soul questioning why she has put up with abusive situations for so long. Her driver Darshan,(Naveen Andrews) is also hurt,a professor,Anglo-Indian, fleeing his failed marriage in England, now driving a cab in New York.
The comedy is subtle, sometimes too subtle and there is some drag to the pacing.  The romance between the two is believable and appealing.
Fortunately the script is spared any clutter, there are other characters but the focus stays squarely on these two, giving the audience a chance to know them and believe that two opposites aren't so opposite after all.
This movie is affordably priced making it a good addition to a collection and also experimental viewing.",1344470400,2,979,4.8562874251497
7924988,5,B00004WC7M,"If you're a fan of Naveen Andrews from ""LOST"", you'll love this movie. Low budget film, but interesting story. Naveen looked pretty good in his youth.",1324166400,,150,4.8076923076923075
7924989,1,B00004WC7M,"I wrote Drowning and trust me when I say the film sucks and I am ashamed to have my name on it.
The producers took my script and along with Ms. Hershey turned it in to a vanity project for her and as she said  at our first meeting  she wanted to  do it  to  show the world ""how much younger and more beautiful she is, more so then anyone expects.""  She was also determined that she and Naveen would become lovers and when they did then it was an obsession on both of their parts to turn the film, which began as the story of a  deracinated woman at the end of her rope, into their love story which is why the film has no ending and all the sub-text was lost.
I apologize to those of you who wasted your time on the bit of nonsense this movie became.",1298505600,14,749,3.9205298013245033

7924991,1,B00004WC7M,"Who greenlighted this dreadul spin on THELMA & LOUISE meets ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE!??  The wasted talents of Barbara Hershey and Carol Lynley are only the top of the list of problems with this one...  Poor direction, sloppy Script Supervision and overall pointlessness make this entirely forgettable.  .. Bizarre!",1033257600,3,322,5.4
