battiato has had my attention since FETUS. it met all my Can needs at the time and still haunts the constant running soundtrack in my head.  he leaves me scratching my head at times = he's all over the place.  i love his driving cannish driving beat on the above, the passionate ballads, the full flowing symphonic pieces, but pollution's beeps and squeeks leaves me scratching my head.
okay okay okay.  this dvd fits all but pollution and is visually captivating.  no subtitles and i don't know a lick of italian, musically, it meets most of my battiato needs.  what a creative guy.  jb",1227657600,,691,4.48
