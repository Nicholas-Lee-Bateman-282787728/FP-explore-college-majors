Before viewing you may want to remove one (or both, go on, get comfortable, you won't regret it) of your shoes to use as a reservoir as it's possible your brain may liquify into a lumpy lake-like-puddle of gelatinous dodoplasm. Don't be alarmed, it happened to me, and the movies looked even better after the interferring concentration-substance was eliminated.

""Jekyll & Hyde Portfolio"" is a motion picture in the long line of significant achievements that feature a suspicious man with sinister eyebrows, and I thought I had collected them all until seeing this one, which is one of the most enigmatic of it's breed and that is truly an esteemed heritage to rub shoulders alongside. It's also a murder mystery unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before. Miss it, and you will not soon forgive yourself.

""A Clockwork Blue"" fills in a LOT of blanks that were left out of the history books. For example, I had just prior to this watched Oliver Stone's excellent and informative documentary ""Untold History of the United States"" and was walking around town with that ""I-know-things-you-don't-know"" puffy-chest-look, but there were segments of ""A Clockwork Blue"" that had me flabbergasted, astounded, puffy-chest-deflated, and (ultimately) re-knowledged.

If I would have studied like this in high school, I'd be a figure of historic significance myself by now (it's never too late, those of larger ambitions), or possibly even attending college.

So don't make the mistake others have. You won't see films such as these 2 every day and I know it requires bravery to take the plunge but here's your big chance to show the world what you're made of. Accolades are your destiny!",1518566400,,1909,4.990566037735849
8643621,2,B00INCVTYI,Two more boring softcore movies. No major babes to be seen so pass this one up. Clockwork Blue did make me laugh a few times at the grey bearded black dude up in heaven watching his WATERMELON TV SET haha!,1450396800,2,205,4.15

8643625,3,B00INCVTYI,"The common element in this 2 4 1 'Drive In' package from the Vinegar Syndrome authoring outfit appears to be the Directorial 'brilliance' of Eric Haims - a film-maker whose ambitious ineptitude would make the infamous Ed Wood proud!

Both of these, wildly divergent, films are of a 70's vintage 'adult' variety but, sadly,  display relatively little skin or sex scenes of an arousing nature.

""Jekyll & Hyde Portfolio"" appears to have taken its' inspiration from the Italian giallo genre that was emerging from Europe at the time of its' original conception. In the murky plot line - females at a nebulous 'institution' are being mysteriously murdered by an un-seen killer who often strikes when they are involved in having sex.  In giallo tradition, there is a brief tableaux of each murder victim. naked and covered with day-glo red blood as the body count rises. Unfortunately this action is presented with all the skill and sophistication of an amateur high school play making the long sequences of 'drama' between the nude scenes pretty unbearable.  In what can only be imagined to be a warped homage to the infamous animal killing sequences in Italian exploitation director Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust' there are 2 extended scenes of frog dissection presented for no apparent reason other than to gross the audience out - it certainly made me cringe!  Little empathy is developed for virtually any of the characters so there's not a lot to engage the viewer as the confusing mess grinds towards its' enigmatic conclusion that alludes to a Jekyll & Hyde style split personality for the killer.
Rene Bond is minimally featured - but neither she, nor any of the other bevy of young lovelies on the chopping block, show more than scant moments of skin.  Almost a 'so bad itz good' viewing experience - but not quite 'bad' enuf to be truly enjoyable even by that criteria.

In 'Clockwork Blue""  director Haims tries his hand at 'comedy' and comes up equally limp.  After a baffling opening sequence that alludes to some 'heavenly intervention' by a black 'Uncle Tom' character who watches the plot progress on a (I kid you not!) watermelon television!... a bunch of time is wasted setting up the 'time travel' hypothesis that forms the basis for the plot.  A lame guy is catapulted into various 'famous' historic 'romances' via a magic watch.  Caesar & Cleopatra, Louis XVI & Marie Antoinette, John Smith & Pocahontas,  Henry VIII & Anne Boleyn (and others) are all included in brief vignettes as the befuddled time traveler pops into the scene.  Perhaps the director was shooting for a Mel Brooks style historic comedy (with tits)  but there wasn't enuf of either comedy nor breasts to make this one enjoyable.  The bright spots in the mess were provided by 70's adult luminaries Susanna Fields (as Marie Antoinette) and Rene Bond (as Anne Boleyn) who both get naked for a few moments.  There are tiny flashes of full female nudity in this flik but waaaay too much time is spent with everyone dressed in period garb spouting un-funny comedic lines.

All in all - I found this to be one of Vinegar Syndromes more disappointing releases.  Quirky, to be sure, but not really delivering a very satisfactory viewing experience as a 'skin-flik'.  This one is definitely more of a 'renter' than a 'keeper', in my opinion.  On the 'technical' side, though, the visual transfer quality of both (widescreen) films is excellent.  No extras.",1401235200,7,3441,4.9067357512953365
