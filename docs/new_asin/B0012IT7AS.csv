8246197,5,B0012IT7AS,"I initially rented this video, and after viewing it, knew I wanted to
have it as part of my  collection of Italian cinema on dvd.
This is silent film at its most romantic, dramatic, and poetic.
At first you might want to giggle at the over-the-top performances,
but as you watch you see the truth at the core of the scenes.
Bits and pieces may seem absurd, and yet it is also the language
of a mirror...your own passions, suffering and impulses, acted out,
on the silver screen...so long ago. It is haunting and beautiful,
and you will never forget it. Highly recommended for those who adore
art, love Italian cinema or silent film, and for all the romantics
out there.  Enjoy!",1226448000,16,677,4.540983606557377
