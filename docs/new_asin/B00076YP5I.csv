2201920,3,B00076YP5I,"I have seen a lot of musicals in my time (and I usually like them all), but this is by far the worst one that I've ever seen.  The sad part is that this might have been a decent erotic musical if there had at least been some cute cast members.  Only Scream Queen Linnea Quigley makes a sexy, but REALLY brief, performance.  I think this script deserves a massive remake with some beautiful cast members.  These repulsive-looking people just ruin the film! Horror fans, don't waste your money on this one. I bet even Linnea wishes that she could forget this movie. C-",976147200,4,566,4.413461538461538

2201988,3,B00076YP5I,"In ""Fairy Tales"" (from 1978), New York accents, New York lingo, and New York characters abound, in this eroticized musical-spoof that was set in some non-existent ""fairyland"" but, was more like ""42nd Street"" at the height of its sleazy and seedy days! I have to admit, it was quite funny too---especially one Robert Staats (as 'Tommy Tucker'/the doorman), who had the best lines and the best delivery by far. Even the ""bawdy"" songs were kind of funny and amusing in their own way.  And of course, I have to make special mention of sexy Anne Gaybis (as 'Snow White'), who alone was worth the price of admission (a great looking woman and a decent actress too. See ""Deep Jaws"" 1976). This is another one of those lost ""relics"" that could have only been produced in the 70's. Not a ""masterpiece"" or a ""work of art"" by any stretch of the imagination (hell, the sets looked like they were made out of paper-mch&eacute;. Very cheap production values). So, with that being said: have a bagel......with lox and cream cheese preferably......oy vey!!

The DVD picture and sound quality is good, but far from excellent (Full Moon Features). NTSC, English (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 75 mins. (BTW: The product description on the DVD case says rated ""R"", however, there is no such indication of an MPAA rating before the start of the film.)

The Prince travels to find her as all the action shifts to a brothel of fairy tale characters.

Many actors appear in other Band productions such as AUDITIONS and CINDERELLA.

2202094,3,B00076YP5I,"Fairy Tales is a marginally entertaining movie best viewed on a REALLY boring day or after armageddon, whichever comes first.

A young charm and charisma-free prince, the son of Old King Cole, is booted from the castle to search for a bride and the bride had better be a virgin. Good luck with that, pal. That's it.  The entire movie in a nutshell.

I enjoy this piece of tripe about once every five years or so, or when I pretend yesterday was Armageddon as the movie is extremely low, low budget, washed out colors, tacky sets and no actors in sight with a script written by a chimpanzee at a typewriter BUT the film has one saving grace. Full frontal nudity and buckets of it. Trust me you will never think the same about Little Bo Peep looking for her sheep the same again. And the movie is a musical so little Bo Peep does a tap dance in only her tap shoes and little else singing about her missing sheep.

I do not recommend this movie because of its poor production values but I guess I have to admit, Mother Nature has contributed a huge ""natural"" value, with enough left over to make a bare-skin rug.",1306627200,11,1109,4.342995169082125

Even so, if Amazon knows or is told about this... they should demand a disclaimer from the producers on that the movie stating that the movie has been edited of original content and refund payment no questions asked when returned for this reason.  That goes for all movies that are sold (for example:[[ASIN:B000VL7VEQ Killing Heat (1981)]this version is heavily edited but still has an R rating.)

""Fairy Tales"" has a wide variety of pretty girls and some classic comedy schtick, snappy musical numbers, and all of the traditional elements of an old-time vaudeville variety show. In that context, it is actually worth owning if you are interested in collecting these last few fleeting attempts at recording what was left of vaudeville before it was left to bleed to death in the gutters of American cultural awareness. It is a good film for what it is. The patter is well timed, the musical numbers are entertaining, and they try to have a little something for everybody.

2202108,2,B00076YP5I,"I bought this video because it co-starred Linnea Quigley who I had recently seen in ""Return of the Living Dead.""  I shouldn't have been disappointed by this film, since it was made in 1979 and started with a particularly silly premise, but I was.

This film is an attempt to blend ""the musical"" with ""porn.""  It further ""breaks new ground"" by following a virginal teenage prince through his exploits in fairy tale land in search of the one woman who can arouse him.  Along the way, he meets various amorous female fairy tale protagonists who are eager to seduce him.  They usually do this by shedding a little clothing during a song and dance, but fail to close the deal.

To me, this kind of song and dance was reminiscent of a grade school tap dance play that might involve lollipops.  More specifically, it was cutesy and not-at-all erotic.  It seemed inappropriate and in poor taste... which some people may say is implicit in any porn.  In this case, however, I can't imagine why this type of inappropriateness or poor taste would stimulate anyone.  I expected (and would have preferred) to see a darker interpretation of fairy tales -- something less child-like and more adult.

Comparing it to other porn, this is very tame.  There is nudity, but nothing explicit.  The girls are attractive in a 1960's sort of way... most of them more round than a contemporary person would consider sexy.  Makeup and hairstyles are severely dated.  Production values are great by 1979 standards, but also severely dated.

I don't like musicals to begin with, nor do I usually like older movies, so this film stood little chance of pleasing me.  However, I've met a few people who enjoyed this film ""back in the day"" and enjoyed seeing it again.  This was definitely in the ""higher budget"" bracket of the porn industry during its era.",1235088000,22,1825,4.7215189873417724
