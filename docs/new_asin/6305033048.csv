This movie is based on comic book stories from the 1950s. [Are they a modern version of ""Grimm's Fairy Tales""?] The movie tells about the religious persecution in the reign of Henry VIII when religious corporations were dissolved and looted to reward the aristocracy. Many of the monks hid to avoid torture and death. A group of people are visiting the catacombs when they find themselves trapped below ground. A hooded man wearing a brown robe asks them of their plans. The scene suddenly changes.

There is a Christmas celebration. A man sits to read a newspaper. He is surprised and falls. ""Merry Christmas"" Mummy tidies up the living room. The radio warns about an escaped lunatic murderer. He is described as wearing a Santa Claus costume. Can he break into this house? She closes the doors and the inside shutters, then removes the mess on the living room rug. Then she gets a surprise!

A man is on his way home to see his wife and children. ""Drive carefully."" He visits another place to see his girlfriend Susan, who drives the car so he can sleep. ""Look out!"" The car crashes and burns. Charles returns home to learn of his fate. Is it a nightmare? Or a dream of his future?

The hooded man talks to another man, whose past is shown. An old man lives across the street. Somebody makes a mess of a rose garden, the wrong man is blamed. His dogs are taken away! Can an Ouija board give him a message? ""Danger."" Those two men plot to get him fired so he loses his retirement! Neighbors avoid him. Those two men plan to buy his property cheap. They send him nasty Valentine cards. There is a funeral. A year passes. Will someone get a surprise visitor? Happy Valentine's Day!

Another man asks why he is there. Ralph speculated with other people's money, and lost. Now its bankruptcy or selling off his prize possessions to raise cash. Can an old statuette grant him three wishes? His car is followed by a stranger. His solicitor gets the news. Enid makes another wish, and it is granted (but there is a hitch). Her last wish is granted, but she regrets it. Alive and suffering forever?

Another man is warned. Major Roger drives to a home for the blind. The patients are told of his appointment at dinner. Their radiators are cold, no extra blankets. It's a matter of economy. The blind develop their other senses and feel the cold. Their soup is watery, the rations are cut. One man asks for a doctor when he is very ill. ""The man is dead."" The patients eat in the dining room. The Major's dog is trapped in the cellar. ""What do you want?"" The blind men build something in the cellar. The dog is getting hungry, so too the Major. The dog will soon be fed. Razor blades stuck in the wall? [You can figure out the ending to this story.]

A door opens and their fate is revealed for all eternity. ""Who's next?"" It is interesting that a British movie was made from American comic books. Some of these stories remind me of those Alfred Hitchcock stories from the late 1950s.",1334275200,,3009,4.4799270072992705

957457,4,6305033048,"It seems that I always have a special place in my heart for horror anthologies, and Tales From The Crypt was one of my favorite shows growing up, so this movie seems like the perfect fit. You just can't go wrong with anthologies, as they are some of the most entertaining films out there. If one story happens to be boring, you can always take solace in the fact that it'll probably be over in about 10 minutes.

(*Spoilers*) ""Tales From The Crypt"" is a collection of five stories, all based on the old comic book series of the same name, that tells the ""futures"" of five individuals who have gotten lost in a tour and are now trapped in a crypt.

""All Through the House"" - A wife kills her husband on Christmas Eve. While she tries to dispose of the body and clean the mess, she hears news about an escaped maniac who is dressed in a Santa suit. Obviously frightened, she locks the house up, continues to clean her husband's blood stains, and dumps his body in the basement. She heads back upstairs only to find out that her daughter (who, like most kids, had been anxiously awaiting Santa) let the maniac in...

Comments: I believe this is the only Tales From the Crypt story to be done twice (this version and the one Robert Zemeckis did for the t.v. show). Naturally, I prefer Zemeckis' version, as his is more realistic and has a darker feel to it. For instance, the maniac in Zemeckis' version looks like a real psycho...someone you'd actually be terrified by if he was outside your house. In this version, the Santa is just some old, skinny guy that wouldn't strike fear into a 12-year-old. Not to mention that this Santa kills the woman by giving her a massage. Yes, that's right, she's killed by what looks to be a massage. I haven't seen Zemeckis' version in almost two years, but I'm pretty sure the main character didn't die of a massage in that one. Either way, this one was decent...not as good as it could have been, but decent nonetheless.

""Relfection of Death"" - A man and his mistress get into a wreck. The man escapes, and searches for people to help him, but everyone turns away in horror. With no one else to go to, he decides to go back to his mistress' apartment, only to find that his face is severely disfigured and he's been dead for two years. But then he wakes up...the whole thing was just a dream. Or was it? Just as he wakes up, they get into a wreck, and the whole thing plays out exactly like it did in his dream.

Comments: The majority of his dream sequence (him walking around looking for help) was pretty pointless, but I can see how it was needed to make the story longer. They also did a good job in building up to the moment that you finally get to see his face (in the dream sequence).

""Poetic Justice"" - A greedy businessman and his father set out to drive his elderly neighbor out of the neighborhood and destroy the man's business (it wasn't really a business, but the elderly man did make toys for kids). First, they decide to frame him and get all of the kid's mothers to turn against him. Then on Valentine's day, they send him dozens of Valentine's cards (all addressed as coming from various people from the town), but with a twist...these cards all have vulgar messages that insult the man. The two businessmen later find out that the man hung himself that day. A year passes, and it's Valentine's Day again. only this time, the elderly man rises up from the grave and gets his revenge...

Comments: This seems to be everyone's favorite, and I can definitely see why. Peter Cushing plays the elderly man, and his performance is so good that it's almost impossible not to feel sorry for his character. The Valentine's Day cards were also pretty funny as well.

""Wish You Were Here"" - This is basically exactly like the story of ""The Monkey's Paw"", so if you're familiar with that, you already know the basic nature of this tale. A husband and wife encounter a statue that gives it's owner three wishes. Naturally, the wife's first wish is to be wealthy. Right after making the wish, her husband gets a phone call telling him to come to the office right away. The husband never makes it to the office though, as he has a heart attack on his way there, crashes, and dies. Even though she's now wealthy due to the insurance from her husband's death, the wife is noticeably upset, and wishes that her husband was back the way he was before the crash. This does little good, as the husband is still dead (remember, he had a heart attack before the crash). Since this doesn't work, she then wishes for him to be alive forever, in the exact condition he was before he left. This is another wish that obviously backfires. The husband is alive alright, but she forgot that he had been embalmed, so the husband is literally 'burning inside'. She takes a sword, cuts up some of his body parts, and tries to put an end to his pain, but she wished for the husband to live 'forever', so he's forced to continuously suffer.

Comments: Even for Tales From the Crypt, this is still pretty brutal. This may be my favorite tale in the movie, as it keeps you interested the whole way through and is unpredictable (well, besides the fact that you know that each wish will backfire).

""Blind Alleys"" - A heartless man is brought in as the new director of a home for the blind. The blind patients are forced to live in harsh conditions and are given slop to eat, all while the director eats an expensive steak dinner. After many pleas for better conditions, the blind men eventually get fed up and plot their revenge...

Comments: Since this is the longest tale, it seems to drag on a little (especially when the patients are building the director's 'prison', which is basically just six minutes of showing the director with a worried look on his face and begging to be let out). Nevertheless, the story is good, and it does it's job well.

After all the stories are finished, the cryptkeeper reveals that this isn't their futures, this is their past. They all are dead, and forced to spend the rest of eternity there. I'm sure most people already figured out this ending midway through the movie, but it's still pretty good anyway. Since this was an older movie, I was suprised to see that the production values were quite good, and the picture quality was way better than I thought it'd be. Overall, there are better anthologies out there, but ""Tales From the Crypt"" is still a very entertaining film.",1100476800,3,6431,4.477815699658703

When inmates for the blind exact revenge on the evil manager in the most diabolical way.  Patrick Magee is awesome! ""All Through The House"" is very memorable with Joan Collins and the homicidal maniac santa claus. Then there is ""The Monkey's Paw""  the end has twist to it. Other stories included in this wonderful horror anthology are: ""Poetic Justice"" (Peter Cushing) about a kindly old man who fixes toys and gives them to children and the mean neighbor who tries  to get rid of him.  ""Reflection of Death""(Carl Maitland) about a buisness man who decides to leave his wife and kids for another woman. All the stories are memorable.

957500,4,6305033048,"This 1972 horror anthology incorporates 5 spine-tingling stories from EC's ""Tales from the Crypt"" comic books. What made this film worth watching is how the stories expose the sinful flaws shrouded in each of the 5 tourists; devious practices of lust, greed and vanity which, of course, ultimately lead the main characters to a horrid demise. Although the first half of the movie was fairly slow, it dramatically picked up the pace as the following tales became increasingly shocking and disturbing.
In ""And All Through the House,"" a greedy housewife named Joanne Clayton (Joan Collins) brutally murders her spouse by smashing his head with a poker. It's Christmas Eve, and after years of meticulous planning, she commits this murder to collect an insurance policy. However, as Joanne attempts to eliminate the body, she is stalked and terrorized by a homicidal lunatic dressed in a Santa Claus costume.
""Reflection of Death"" concerns the fate of Carl Maitland (Ian Hendry), a cheating husband who chose to abandon his wife and children in order to begin a new life with his sexy mistress. As the two drive away together, Carl is suddenly killed in a fiery car accident and later on walks the streets as a festering corpse. Upon realizing the horror of his predicament, he wakes up back in his car; to his relief, his death turned out to be nothing more than an awful nightmare. Or was it?
In ""Poetic Justice,"" Arthur Grimsdyke (Peter Cushing) is a charitable garbage collector who enjoys giving toys and candy to the neighborhood kids. However, his life is soon ruined by James Elliot (Robin Phillips), a spoiled, wealthy leech who forces Arthur to sell him his only property. By tarnishing the old man's public image and sending hateful Valentine's Day cards, Mr. Elliot drives poor Arthur to suicide. One year later, on Valentine's Day, Arthur's vengeful spectre rises from the grave to rip James's heart out...literally!
My most favorite tale is none other than ""Wish You Were Here,"" which explains how a married couple try to recover from their financial woes by making 3 wishes on an Oriental statue. When Enid Jason (Barbara Murray) wishes to have a gaggle of money, her husband Ralph (Richard Greene) dies in a terrible auto accident. Then, when the grieving widow wishes her spouse to be how he was before the crash, a group of undertakers report to Enid that Ralph actually died of cardiac arrest. Finally, poor Enid makes the ultimate mistake by wishing for Ralph eternal life; he wakes up screaming in constant agony because the embalming fluid is corroding his arteries and organs! Even when Ralph's writhing body is hacked to pieces, he would never die!
The last scary story told in ""Tales from the Crypt"" is ""Blind Alleys."" Major Rogers (Nigel Patrick) is a former army officer hired to run a residence home for the blind. Under his cruel tactics, the patients are freezing cold at night and poorly fed during the day. Later on, when one neglected patient succumbs to illness, all of the abused residents finally had enough. Seeking revenge, they kidnap Rogers and teach him a ruthless lesson on how it feels to be truly blind. Let's just say that the Major's demise includes a half-starved dog and 100 or so razor blades!
What I didn't like about this film is how the Crypt Keeper is wrongly portrayed: Ralph Richardson's interpretation is that of a dignified monk guarding a cobwebbed monastary. (Unlike the EC version, who acts as a morbid color commentator bearing an endless bag of puns and wisecracks.) Also, with his dull dialogue and silly brown robe, the Crypt Keeper could have easily been parodied by Mel Brooks! If you love watching the HBO series and possess reprints of the original comics, this film may take getting used to. Nevertheless, ""Tales from the Crypt"" is worth seeing, along with ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.""",1062460800,10,3853,4.892966360856269

The second concerns a man in an automobile accident. the third deals with a harmless old man who commits suicide then comes back from the grave for revenge. the fourth is a variation on the monkeys paw tale. and the fifth deals with a home for the blind and the revenge they take after a greedy new owner is to blame for the death of one of their friends. and then there's the freaky ending......

Five strangers find themselves in in some kind of ruined castle inhabited by the late Sir Ralph Richardson who reveals their futures in five tales.
The first sees Joan Collins murdering her much older husband on Christmas Eve while an excaped lunatic dressed as Santa is loose  in the neighbourhood. The choir voices from the radio while all this is going on is quite effective.
The second stars Ian Hendry who deserts his family to run off with his lover but is involved in a car crash which disfigures him. He eventually finds his own way back home to discover his lover is blind from the accident and that he is not too good shape himself when catching a glimpe of himself in a glass table.
The third stars the excellent Peter Cushing in a touching and even tear jerking performance as an old man who commits suicide after his rich neighbout attempts to drive him out of his house. A year later he takes his revenge in a superb climax to the story.
Story number 4 Richard Greene goes bankrupt and his very silly wife decides to use an old Chinese figurine that grants three wishes to get the money back. Things don't go to plan of course and Greene ends up dead. Won't ruin the film by telling you what happens next. But this is perhaps the most psychologically terrifying sequence i have ever seen. Really gets you thinkin.
The final story has Nigel Patrick as a chief of a home for the blind. He treats the inhabitants terribly one of them being the superb Patrick Magee and they exact a very clever revenge on Patrick that includes razor blades and a starved alsatian ( nuff said )
The ending is not pleasant either but then again won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it.

The first story describes Joan Collins killing her older husband  and stealing from his safe, only to be killed by an escaped killer dressed  up as Santa Claus. The second story describes Ian Hendry leaving his wife  and two children so that he can stay with a friend, only for their car to  crash and Hendry come back from the dead to find his wife remarried, his  mistress blind, and himself as corpse. The third story describes Richard  Johnson who is forced to sell his items due to over-spending and his wife  who makes three wishes from an ancient Oriental statue. The first wish is  for more money, after which, Johnson's solicitor, Roy Dotrice, tells him of  more money. While Johnson is driving to meet Dotrice, he dies and his car  crashes. Dotrice visits his widow, who makes a second wish that Johnson  return before the car crash, resulting in coffin-carriers returning  Johnson's body in a coffin. The lead carrier explains that Johnson died of  a heart attack before the car crash. The last wish is for Johnson to live  forever, which makes him in agony, as his body is filled with embalming  liquid. His wife cuts him up to stop his agony, but he is still living. The  fourth story tells of Robin Philips, who wants his house to have a higher  market price, and is persecuting retired Peter Cushing because he will not  sell his house - this is keeping the market price down. After Philips makes  the police take Cushing's dogs away (for not having a licence, although one  later escapes and returns), tells the neighbours to keep their children  away from Cushing, and sends him hate mail, Cushing commits suicide, and  returns exactly a year later from his grave, killing Philips by cutting out  and wrapping his heart. The last story describes how ex-Army Major Nigel  Patrick forces his blind hospital patients to suffer from cold and lack of  good food, so that he can use the money for himself in buying paintings.  The patients, lead by Patrick Magee, kidnap Patrick's dog first and later  Patrick, starving them of food, and then build a maze with razors on the  walls. Both Patrick and his dog are let free, and his dog eats him as a  result of its hunger. Afterwards, all 5 people ask the monk who he is, and  he tells them they are already dead.

7881698,4,6305033048,"Based on comic book stories Tales from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror, this British anthology begins as five strangers on a catacombs tour who end up trapped with a robed monk who reveals the dark secrets of why each of them is there.  This crypt keeper (Ralph Richardson; Time Bandits, Rollerball, Dragonslayer) seems all too knowledgeable about their sins and reveals how they all came to be here today.

The stories involve crazed madmen, zombies in various forms, prophetic dreams, twisted wishes and some very, very angry blind men.  Perhaps due to the dated style, these horror stories will bring you no sense of horror today.  They will, however, make you smile as they are nice little horror stories whose concepts have been used over and over again in past decades.  Think of them more as campfire stories than facets of a horror film.

There are five short stories, one for each stranger in the crypt

And All Through the House stars Joan Collins (Empire of the Ants) a trophy wife who murders her considerably older husband on Christmas Eve to make herself a rich widow.  While this may sound evil enough already, she executes her plan with her daughter asleep (or is she?) upstairs.  That same evening we hear radio announcements of a recently escaped psychopath wearing a Santa Claus suitand all get what they deserve.
This short story is an absolute delight in its simplicity and it has been retold on Tales from the Crypt, season 1, episode 2 (1989) and then replayed by Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984).

Reflection of Death changes pace for the worst with a less engaging tale of a man sneaking away to leave his wife and family for his mistress.  The man awakens from a bad dream revealing his future (much as with a ghost of Christmas future) only to relive it.  A clever idea at the time (over 40 years ago), but now a trope too played out to hold up.

Poetic Justice finds Peter Cushing (Horror of Dracula, The Mummy, The Curse of Frankenstein) as the elderly Arthur Grimsdyke, the kindest widower living only for his dogs and the local children whom he entertains with homemade toys.  Arthurs neighbor takes action to part Arthur from the things he loves most along with his formerly saintly reputation and happiness.  This predictably leads to Arthurs death and revenge.

Wish You Were Here will feel most familiar, being based on the now-troped-up popular story of the Monkey's Paw.  In this story a formerly wealthy man finds himself deep in debt and forced to sell his assets.  After breaking the bad news to his wife, she suddenly notices some strange text etched in an antique Asian statuette that offers three wishes to its owner, but offers a warning as well.  Not heeding the warning his wife hastily wishes for richesonly to find grave consequence.  Subsequent and more careful wishes to solve her error only make things worse.
We find more use of the Monkeys Paw concept in The Monkeys Paw (2013; which I DO NOT advise watching) and the Wishmaster (1997) moviesamong many others.

Blind Alleys is by far my favorite short of the anthology and the one that stuck with me in the 20 years since I first saw this movie.  A selfish (to the point of being cruelexcept for when it comes to his dog) retired veteran takes a job as a superintendent of a home for blind men.  As the officer in charge he budgets himself steak, brandy and fine art for his office as the elderly blind men freeze through the winter with little meat to warm their plates.  When their requests are not met and a fellow resident dies after succumbing to illness in the cold, the blind seek revenge in a way that just makes my toes curl in delighta way that makes me think and this is before the Saw films came out.

This is a classic horror anthology not to be missed.  It may not be dripping with gore and the stories may seem simple by todays standards, but its easy to see what makes this a beloved horror classic.",1433289600,,3922,4.599137931034483

7881702,5,6305033048,"I'm a huge oldies horror movie buff, and my word; although the movie wasn't what I thought it would be, it still ranks up there with my #1's. There isn't a wise cracking Crypt Keeper, but that makes the movie all the more creepy. As far as cinema goes, it's nice to see where the show 20+ years later came from. A friend of mine owns some of the original horror comics, but I never got to read them due to his keeping them framed for their sentimental value as a horror buff himself.
