7207875,2,B00Y7R9HQU,"The technical quality of the DVDs (sound, picture) was fine.  But these are 4 extremely boring movies.  I have several other Cantor movies and remember liking them.  But of these, only Kid from Spain was at all entertaining.  I love watching Eddie sing and dance.  But not act.  His movie persona I like too - and it fits his looks. And the songs (even by Arlen, Warren/Dubin and the team that wrote for the Marx Bros) were terrible - boring - not more than 3 songs was at all fun to listen too.  And the films costar such people as Ethel Merman, Charlotte Greenwood, Robert Young, Brian Donlevy (he always plays the bad guy, and frankly I don't like that either).  The Goldwyn Girls are about as naked as they could be and still be dressed.  Though Cantor's movies are comedies and Jolson's dramas, and I'd rather see comedies, I like Jolson's flicks better.  Also Jolson gets all the good songs, and I like his singing better.  But as for performing the song, I much prefer Cantor.  And Roman Scandals (I think that's the one) was from a story by Kaufman, and partially scripted by him.  High octane talent behind all four of them, and they were painfully boring!

Okay.  Everybody else loves these movies, so tell me what a jerk I am for not liking them.",1442793600,,1257,4.475770925110132

I was very disappointed in the quality of the print and the terrible sound quality, some sections having half the frequencies missing. I know these are all early thirties films and expect a few flaws, but I have many films from the same era which have been been restored to perfection.

The weird Busby Berkley, pre code, musical numbers are wonderful, though He wouldn't perfect that format until a few years later. Never seen the 3 other films, so I'm looking forward to that.",1434499200,5,383,4.485714285714286

I remember staying up to 3 a.m. with my cassette player to tape the soundtracks in the 60s. Later in the early 80's they were the first movies I made permanent copies of on my Betamax.  These were transferred to VHS and then DVD.  Although I was able to upgrade by the occasional playing on TCM, you can imagine the quality.  I am ordering these asap",1433116800,8,483,4.454545454545454
8717582,4,B00Y7R9HQU,"This is a wonderful collection of four Eddie Cantor films from the early to mid 30s. Some of the films hold up,while others don't. Let's take a look.
Palmy Days(released Oct/31)stars,among others Eddie,Charlotte Greenwood and Charles Middleton. Eddie is an employee of a crooked psychic,and not a very good one. He forces Eddie to apply for a position in a  pastry and bread factory. He takes on being an efficiency expert. When the crooked psychic and his henchmen try to get their mitts on the presidents dough,Eddie saves the dough,literally and figuratively. This film was a big smash for Eddie. The opening number is typical fantasy of a Cantor film. Busby Berkeley does the dances. 3 1/2-4 stars.
The Kid From Spain(released Nov/32)stars,among others,Eddie,Lyda Roberti and Robert Young. The story finds Young and Cantor as school chums who don't graduate from college due to a prank gone wrong. Young goes back to his home country of Mexico, where he tries wooing his girlfriend back,but she is engaged to another man due to her father's say so. Eddie meanwhile has trouble, as he was forced by fleeing bank robbers to drive them to safety. They force him across the border to Mexico,where he eventually meets up with Young once more. Young tries to throw an American cop off the trail who is following Eddie ,by telling him he isn't who he thinks he is,but is actually a famous Spanish bullfighter. It ends up Eddie ends up having to really fight  a bull. Post fight Eddie comes forth with evidence that Young's betrothed fiance is set to marry a crook. Young gets his girl,and Eddie gets the girl's friend(Roberti).
Leo McCarey directs it and it has the most substantial plot of all the films herein. There are a lot of funny moments,the crossing of the border being one of the best of them. Nice choreography from Berkeley. 4- 4 1/2 stars.
Roman Scandals(released Dec/33)stars,among others,Eddie,Edward Arnold and Alan Mowbray. The story here centers around a town(West Rome) ne'er do well,Eddie. He is kicked out of town by a crooked businessman,who he has the dope on,and ends up falling asleep and waking up in ancient Rome. There is similar trouble in this imaginary world,as there is in West Rome,with a crooked Emperor who he must unmask. Eventually he comes back to reality and settles the score with the man who had him run out of town. With nice numbers by Berkeley,this is a drop down from The Kid from Spain, but it certainly has a lot of moments to recommend it. 3 1/2- 4 stars.
 Strike Me Pink(released  Jan/36) stars,among others,Eddie,Brian Donlevy,Ethel Merman and William Frawley. This film has Eddie running a store with a college man as a boarder,who is trying to graduate,after seven tries. He finally does,with Eddie's help,who has himself taken a DIY course on becoming firm and courageous. While the new graduate goes off the join the Navy Eddie is recruited by the guys mother, who runs an amusement park. He immediately has to deal with a mob who want to install crooked slot machines throughout the park. It seems the previous holders of Eddies position all met untimely demises when they wouldn't go along with them. Eddie eventually routs the gang and the park is safe once more. This film starts out with great potential,but about half way through it falls apart,becoming tedious and boring. The last final chase of the crooks after Eddie, devolves into plain silliness. One of the best things of this film is Merman's High and Low number. It has to be arguably the best filmed number she ever did. It is lovingly photographed and shaded. 2 1/2-3 stars.
The first three films feature Berkeley numbers,as noted,while the last film is Berkeley-less. In the first three Eddie eventually appears in Black Face. Al Jolson seems to have become the whipping boy for its usage,while Cantor has got off with little or no mention. Why is that? There definitely seems to be a double standard somewhere. It was the norm for many,many years in theater and is no more offensive than burnt toast,even today.
Eddie Cantor was one of the supreme artists of the 20th Century along with his friend Jolson. To say they don't make them like those men anymore,is an understatement.
The first three films present Eddie as giving the public of the depression era a little sex,a little smile and a song. All three are handsomely represented in each.;and them being pre code films,he gets away with a lot of double entendre's in each category. The last film is post code and it shows. Gone are much of the knowing eye winks and hidden meanings in the songs and jokes, and the dancers are more discreetly covered up.
In conclusion,this is a must have set for all Cantor fans. It is,however,a mixed bag. My best pic being The Kid From Spain,while the poorest is Strike Me Pink. The other two fall somewhere in between. Eddie never fails to amuse,as he always seems to play a milquetoast kind of character, that is always likeable and quick with the jokes and songs. Eddie had a lovable style all his own and it is easy to see why he was one of the highest paid entertainers of his generation.",1534118400,,5103,4.769230769230769

8717584,5,B00Y7R9HQU,"I bought Roman Scandals on VHS years ago. This DVD is wonderful. ""Keep Young and Beautiful"" is the big dance number where Eddie is singing and running around in the Roman ladies bath... Lucile Ball is one of the slave girls who dances herself to death in the only scene that is serious. My favorite line ""No, first you hold my hand. Then you will want to shuffle the whole deck!""

Palmy Days, Eddie's in love with the wrong woman, until nearly the end of the film. Lots of pre-code innuendo. ""You can always have your spinach on the side."" George Raft plays a gangster! Are you surprised?

Strike Me Pink. Ethel Merman is wonderful. I liked her and Eddie in Kid Millions, too.

The Kid From Spain. Not as funny as Palmy Days, but still good. Toby Wing is one of the girls in the background. OLE!

These movies are not politically correct, but funny Vaudeville shtick.  A product of the times. The biggest movie of all time in the early 1930s starred a Vaudeville actor singing in black face, so MGM had to have a Vaudeville actor singing in black face. Warner had Al, MGM had Eddie. They sold tickets. These movies are still funny.

If you like musical comedy movies that are heavy on singing, joking and dancing, then you will enjoy this collection.",1532044800,,1250,4.484581497797357

8717588,5,B00Y7R9HQU,"This is a 4 disc set in a space saving standard size case. Each has its own hinged retainer for ease of access. No insert or scene index.
These are real DVDs not DVD-Rs like some other Warner Archive Collection releases. (The set I received is DVD, Amazon states DVD-R?)
This is an essential film collection but done on the cheap. All discs have the same image as the package design. The only menu option is Play, no chapter menu. There are haphazard chapters for each disc though. May be better just to use FWD & REV.
These discs were produced from very good quality prints and are not restored. Occasional scratches and blemishes but nothing truly disruptive. Very good definition as well with no visible pixelating.
Sound quality varies at times but is fairly consistent and tolerable.

I think Eddie Cantor is one of the greatest Vaudeville/Burlesque comedian song & dance men of all time and these wonderful films are evidence of that.
His onscreen persona was milquetoast and relentless androgynous innuendo, very risqu at times.
Always self effacing, generous and kind, Eddie would do or say anything to get a laugh.
One of these things is something known as Black Face (minstrel),when a white performer attempts to appear African American.
Back in the day Black Face was a silly clownish stereo type and it was understood as such, especially by Cantor who as far as I know never used it to further a hateful agenda.
There are many foolish stereo types and life is too short to be hyper sensitive or defensive. I am no more offended by Eddie Cantor's Black Face routines than I am by Eddie Murphy's White Face routines which are absolutely brilliant. Comedy is controversial by nature.
I prefer to laugh.

Palmy Days (1931)

One of the greatest comedies of all time and a favorite of mine!
Zany, fast paced and sophisticated.
Brilliant writing by Cantor and maybe his best work.
This film reunites Eddie with another actor from the 1930 film Whoopee! They launch into a replay of their You Think That's Bad?! Look At This! sketch, an early precursor of The Four Yorkshire Men and the camera fades out! We are spared...
I tend to think of this as the Pyoit Pyoit Pyoit film for the Cantor trademark mouth sound that is hilariously used throughout.
Gold.
Palmy Days has beautiful cinematography and rich Art Deco design.
There are a number of very innovative dances directed by choreographer Busby Berkeley featuring the ever present Goldwyn Girls.
Absolute American masterpiece.
(disc has 26 chapters)

The Kid From Spain (1932)

This is by concept a College Buddy film.
Situation of course is a large part of the story. Much more love interest here featuring Robert Young.
Busby Berkeley and the Goldwyn Girls are here again and they introduce the film in a lovely way.
I think Cantor wears the largest sombrero in cinema history here!
A very good, enjoyable film overall but not as ambitious as Palmy Days.
(disc has 30 chapters)

Roman Scandals (1933)

An odd film. Basically fantasy/dream concept. Eddie is walking down a dusty road after being kicked out of town by corrupt politicians and police and inexplicably walks into ancient Rome.
Many good historical routines ensue but the pace is a bit slow and material is almost mediocre.
Busby and The Girls are here with some revealing choreography but dance steps aside for chariot racing this time.
There is a fascinating scene in this film with Eddie in Black Face. When his deception is discovered one of the African American dancers turns on a steam bath valve,Cantor shrinks,gets hot and jumps in a pool washing his makeup off. A very telling scene. In the next film in this collection there is no mention whatsoever of Black Face.
(disc has 29 chapters)

Strike Me Pink (1936)

Another comedy masterpiece, based on the novel Dreamland by Clarence Budington Kelland.
Excellent casting all around.
Ethel Merman and the period comedian Parkyakarkus give inspired performances.
This film features Eddie as an amusement park manager resisting mafia type influence. Many many hilarious laughs and the most awesome roller coaster ride in cinema history!
A number of well defined characters including strong women.
Merman also performs musically here (vocals), as she does in the Cantor 1934 classic Kid Millions.
There is a scene where Ethel is approached by a cigarette girl in a night club and she refuses stating 'No thanks, I don't smoke.' A bold statement at that time. Impressive.
The Girls are here, choreographed by Robert Alton this time, and a very special solo performance (The Lady Dances)!
(disc has 29 chapters)

All of these films are beautiful and great fun. I am so impressed with all the talent and effort that show in them.

I am also impressed by the stellar humanitarianism of Mr. Eddie Cantor, who was instrumental in the formation of The March Of Dimes.

Not only an Artist, but someone who actually made this world a better place for so many...and it still shows.",1482364800,11,4957,4.831367924528302
8717589,5,B00Y7R9HQU,"Don't believe the guys who said the sound and picture quality is poor.  These videos are very acceptable for the early thirties.  They may not be restored to the level of something like Gone With The Wind, but nobody knows who Cantor is today.  His movies haven't been shown on TV in decades, except maybe a very few times on TCM.  So Warner's can't spend a fortune on restoration for Cantor's movies.  But believe me the quality is fine.  To the poster who said these movies are boring, he is totally wrong!  The songs are fantastic and movies are a laugh riot.  Obviously, if you are expecting something modern, you are not going to like these.  Cantor will seem ""silly"" to some viewers of today, but to people who love this Roaring 20's kind of music and vaudeville one-liners, these movies are a must see!  These films are hilarious and I can even see some skits that must have influenced Jerry Lewis in the 50's.",1467504000,8,917,4.503030303030303

I cannot believe that Warner's, who usually do such a good job, could not have accessed better quality prints than these. They are very soft and look simply awful.
Although the previously issued laser discs were just as bad, to make matters worse the framing of the picture in all four films is heavily cropped.",1450051200,7,428,4.72
