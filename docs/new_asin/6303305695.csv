7843096,5,6303305695,"Probably the most romantic series - or movie - I've ever seen!  The spin it puts on the ""Beauty and the Beast"" scenerio points out what is truly important in a relationship.  A second aspect of the series is that I find it also fuels the imagination for what might really be going on in the great cities' underground subway systems.

Before long Vincent and Father become trapped when a section of the tunnels caves in, and Catherne finds  herself in the awkward position of begging for help from a man she has  previously judged unfit for her company.  She needs equipment from Elliot  (no questions asked) in order to have hope of excavating Vincent and Father  from the cave-in.  The episode has some sharply-written dialogue between  Vincent and Father as they endure their difficult circumstances in the best  humor possible.  The interaction between Catherine and Elliot is also  well-done, and there is a memorable ending between Vincent and  Catherine.
In 1998 I conducted a poll among Beauty and the Beast fans  asking them to rate the 44 episodes of the first two seasons on a 1-to-10  scale.  31 fans participated.  ""Shades of Grey"" finished 6th out  of the 44 episodes.
I placed ""Shades of Grey"" 17th in my own  personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering of the episodes.",960422400,13,1056,4.870056497175141
