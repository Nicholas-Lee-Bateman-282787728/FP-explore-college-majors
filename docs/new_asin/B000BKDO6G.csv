2420924,5,B000BKDO6G,"EINSTEIN'S BIG IDEA is an absolutely fabulous documentary.  This film truly sets the standard for NOVa and makes me lament the fact that more programming isn't done like this.  If only the amount of money that goes into general programming went into PBS.  That would be something else.

But enough of my own ridiculous desires.  EINSTEIN'S BIG IDEA chronicles some of the most fascinating scientific work that has been done in the last couple of centuries.  It is an idea so big that its implications have been vast, not just within the fields of science & mathematics, but in our society and culture at large.  NOVA also shows how Einstein's achievement was not the happy accident we often see it as.  Instead, this documentary seeks to situate his discovery by exploring the lives of other pioneers in related fields, richly filling out the personal lives of these scientists and, above all, situating their achievements in a rich history and context.

In the end, EINSTEIN'S BIG IDEA accomplishes two goals.  First, I came away from the program with a bunch of ideas and information swimming in my head, the result of handing me the information in a digestible format.  Second, I was entertained throughout the entire program.  It truly didn't feel like I was learning--I was being entertained.

If only I could go back and replace some of the boring school films I had to watch in middle/high school with the sharp work of NOVA.  It would have been a treat!  If you haven't seen the excellent NOVA lineup, I suggest that you remedy it with a liberal dose!  Happy viewing!",1133049600,57,1575,4.777777777777778
2420925,5,B000BKDO6G,"What's most impressive about this story is the presentation of science as a human endeavor, undertaken by people who struggle with issues of class, gender, politics and ego, just like the rest of the world does. It's a bit reminiscent of the James Burke ""Connections"" programs PBS ran years ago in that each element of the famous equation (E=mc2) has a fascinating story behind it involving fascinating people. This is groundbreaking work for NOVA, and I hope it indicates that more programs of this quality are in their production pipeline.",1129075200,14,541,5.022222222222222
2420926,5,B000BKDO6G,"Every year while teaching physics and chemistry I showed this DVD, even though it took 2 class periods.  The 10th grade chemistry students watched it and answered some very short-answer questions as they watched.  The questions were designed to make sure they paid attention. However, they liked it much I could have possibly done without the questions.  I did continue them because most of the students became my physics students the following year, and in that course we delved into the theory of light as Einstein tried to provide answers as to what it was..  I showed the DVD again and most of them remembered it.  The students had to research both theories of light, the corpuscular and the wave, and write and defend  their view points of which theory they chose.
I highly recommend this DVD because it highlighted the real problem that Einstein was interested in, instead of the Theory of Relativity, for which most people know him.",1452124800,,939,4.8375

Despite some silly dialogue and some of the acting (Moaning Myrtle is Einstien' first wife!), it is an excellent story highlighting many important discoveries before Einstein stunned the world of science (though it did take a while for other scientists to realize this!).

John Lithgow does a great job narrating, and the special effects and experimental setups are first rate.",1419033600,,504,4.988095238095238
2420935,5,B000BKDO6G,"A great video that shows how science and discovery is a process of building knowledge, where one person's insights feeds the imagination of the next person.  I really appreciated how this film shows that Einstein's insights, though highly imaginative, came out of the discoveries of others before him.  And the really nice thing about this video is that it names several female thinkers and scientists who contributed to Einstein's bid idea.  Our 14-year-old daughter also enjoyed watching this dramatization of science... portraying science being done by curious, interesting and inquisitive people throughout history - including women who are seldom mentioned in school textbooks.",1416700800,,682,5.601941747572815

For instance the E, energy, shows how Michael Faraday worked with energy. The M, matter, or mass, was worked on by Lavoisier in France, and also Emily Duchatelet's work with physics, etc. It then shows the work of Lisa Meitner with the theory of the splitting of the atom.

It is one of the best movies about the man, but it really makes understaning E=MC2 something almost anyone can do. The day I got my own copy I watched it three times. And I have now viewed it many many times.",1374451200,,336,3.9558823529411766
2420950,4,B000BKDO6G,"I like the product. But my copy has gaps of white spaces at the top of the film where the black bar is, and the film is a bit jumpy in this area, which is a bit annoying. It is for this reason that I give the product 4 stars instead of 5. But the overall picture and sound quality is good.

Einstein's Big Idea is a fascinating story. I love learning about science, so this was a sure buy for me. Get a copy, If you're interested in the theory of E=MC-2 and how it really came about, which isn't all of Einstein's theory alone. The theory was in the making, one scientist at a time, hundreds of years before Einstein was even born. Here is a break down of how E=MC-2 came about;

(1800's)
E=Energy - discovered by a young, uneducated blacksmith, scientist-hopeful, named Michael Farady ( He theorized and proved that energy could be converted from one form to another)

(1700's)
M=Mass  - discovered by Antoine Lavoisier, a tax collector, turned scientist experimenter, ( he set out to  demonstrate that nature is a closed system, that in any transformation, no amount of matter, no mass is ever lost, and none is gained)

C stands for Celeritas, (Latin for ""swiftness"") the Speed of Light -  This area also refers to Michael Faraday's contribution to E=MC-2, (who is now at this point in his life, Professor Faraday), with help from another scientist, Professor James Clerk Maxwell, who's expertise in Mathematics, helped proved Farady's theory that light is an electromagnetic wave, which when moving only at a particular speed, creates electricity. That speed is 670 million miles per hour. That's the speed of light. Hince, light is an electromagnetic wave.

2 is for Squared - demonstrated by a young French woman named, Emilie de Chatelet, a philosopher, a scientist, a mathematician, a linguist (in 1700's Emilie de Chatelet demonstrated and proved that Newton's formula for calculating speed (its mass x velocity), is incorrect.  She proved by demonstrating that Gottried Leibniz 's formula, (mass times its velocity squared), which was  discounted by others, was indeed the correct formula to use when calculating  speed moving twice as fast or doubling the height of another object)

(Early 1900's)
E=MC-2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared...

And then there was Einstein, a low-paying Patent Office employee, who had no idea how to explain his theory, E=MC-2 to the world, due to his lack of education resulting as a college drop out. No one understood Einstein's theory, not even Einstein himself, and no one seemed to care, except an important Physicist name Max Planck, who's extensive support to Einstein put Einstein on the path to fame and fortune and making him a household name.

Germany 1907 - Unlocking and Atom
Lise Meitner, a jewish physicist, in Hitler's Germany, who achieved success, but along with terror and betrayal, discovered the splitting of the atom, the discovery of nuclear fission. Using Lise Meitner's formula, in 1942 teams of American physicists all over the country, secretly begin an effort on building an atom bomb, which Lise Meitner refused to have anything to do with. Upon achieving their quest, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, demonstrating the power of E=MC-2.

If you have an interest in E=MC-2, then you'll want to buy the movie. I would recommend the product, as it is a great learning tool as well as an entertaining movie.",1365724800,,3415,4.884083044982699
2420951,5,B000BKDO6G,The complete story of the the Energy/Mass relationship and the Conservation of Mass-Energy is brilliantly told in this documentary.

2420952,2,B000BKDO6G,"This video is composed purely of dramatical reenactments. It's maybe 10% actual science and explanations, 20% interviews, and 70% soap opera. Literally, a daytime soap opera.  More of a history lesson than a science lesson, I learned very little. I also sensed that many historical liberties were taken and thus a lot of fiction was injected into the video. Do yourself a favor and skip out on this. Opt for another Einstein video.

2420953,4,B000BKDO6G,"Not so much just about Einstein, but about different scientists who over time contributed the pieces needed to form the famous equation. A decent video to watch, but not recommended if you are looking specifically for information on Einstein.",1355270400,,242,5.230769230769231
2420954,4,B000BKDO6G,"The DVD case is good and the DVD itself was in great shape.

Firstly, I was first shown this in my Honors Physics class on a day when we didn't have much to do, so any teachers out there, consider using this. It's really great!

The acting is pretty good, even if it gets a little corny at times (it's a documentary without actual footage featuring just about all of the characters in the story, what do you expect?). I found it really informative.

I also really enjoyed seeing a documentary that not only featured four intelligent scientific women, but also including one who was Jewish. I don't mind watching stories about Newton or Apollo 13 (three Caucasian Christian men), and I know that history books are really moving towards actual fact, which includes the fact that, well, women were actually AROUND and not simply spending their days birthing babies, cleaning clothes, and cooking. It's also nice to see something historical featuring a Jewish woman because I just see so few in histories outside of Hebrew School (and even then, few outside of Israel).

Let me just say this: I'm not a teacher, and I certainly don't teach physics. I'm not even a science or math major. I'm a college girl who saw this in her junior year of high school and just liked it. So I purchased this for personal enjoyment, not for teaching purposes. I'm not saying this should ONLY be used for personal enjoyment (see above), but it can be. I hope you enjoy it too!",1343433600,,1454,4.602316602316602
2420955,5,B000BKDO6G,"This is a great production. Great narrative, great acting, a good combination of lecture format and dramatic interpretation that makes for an exciting documentary. A thorough overview of the history of the great formula, E+mc2, that gives the amateur a solid feel for the true development of the equation.

It is slightly feministic in its history. The characters and stories it chooses to highlight are driven by feministic ideology. I was able to pick this up rather quickly but I fear that the young and impressionable might be misled.",1309910400,2,538,5.044943820224719

I rate it top notch, however for those of us who are used to quality DVD this is not the case for the disk supplied by NOVA. It is a disk in DVD format but not in DVD quality. If you are willing to settle for second best then this is for you. My recommendation: Don't buy.",1301616000,6,449,4.232558139534884
2420957,3,B000BKDO6G,"My response in one sentence: needed much more focus on *science*-particularly E=mc2- and less p.c. finger wagging and personal drama reenactments.
The doc is called ""Einstein's Big Idea"" and we delve so much into personal matters and the personal problems of his predecessors. How 'bout more on the equation and how it was discovered and what uses it has been put to, as well as more analogies and descriptions to give the viewer an intuitive understanding?
I'll say it is a fair documentary and especially good in dealing with the *personal issues of scientists*. It is not unfit for junior high and perhaps high school freshman (not ap classes).

I bought this dvd to maybe get a little bit of an idea on what Einstein's work means--specifically that equation we've all heard of but most of us don't know anything about.
Naturally, when creating a documentary the filmmakers want to dramatize things to make it a compelling story for people. And perhaps that might help people get through the science (Lol). You might say, ""well just watch a lecture next time if you don't want biography"". My reply to that would be I did want some biography, just done more intelligently, with more focus on the scientific work, and more sympathy for the hero of our tale. And sympathy to Einstein's predecessors but without the anachronistic moralizing, however subtle.

So (if you'd like examples) we see Einstein's poor first wife nag him about his responsibilities to his family as he struggles to understand the Universe and specifically the nature of light. The poor woman, putting up with this self-centered man. And if you don't sense that when viewing scenes of the Einstein family in their humble home we then get an observation by one of the commentators that Einstein was selfish and tended to ignore everything except his work. And after Einstein gets recognition we are treated to a dramatic scene of him abandoning his family at a train station no less. We're told by narrator John Lithgow that Einstein divorced Mileva and married his cousin (No explanation is given but you know most people these days are disgusted, no?) as melancholic music plays.. and are informed that after achieving fame Einstein had many affairs. His first wife fades into the background, tears in her eyes, as Einstein rides away. The next image shows Einstein kicked back in his train cabin, content, with a pleased expression on his face.

We want to understand the history and social pressures that these people endured. But I'd prefer to not see the disgusted expression of Emilie Chatelet's biographer when she sadly quotes Voltaire as saying of her, ""a great man whose only fault was being a woman"". It must have been so hard as a French Aristocrat and a woman interested in science! Think about it folks. French nobility as victim of sexism. Booo-hooo. And yet she was lovers with Volatire and multiple partners and did what she wanted. Try being a male French peasant and having the opportunity to do science! Lol. Yes, so not only do we get personal dramas but a feminist tale of oppression. Micheal Faraday had to overcome class divisions, we are shown, but in that case we're simply told this and shown him being at first dismissed by snooty English upperclassman. Seems that he had to go through a lot more than Chatelet but we instead are focused on his victory (and that's a good thing).

2420966,5,B000BKDO6G,"Einstein's Big Idea is based on David Bodani's bestseller, E=mc2.  It is a documentary showing the connections between three basic discoveries and how they led to Einstein's powerful equation E=mc2.  (I enjoyed the personal stories of the men and women who discovered energy, and electromagnetism and the relationship of velocity and gravity)

Einstein had a fascination with light and its properties.  How he determined that light is electromagnetic in nature and its relation to time is key.  The documentary is a combination of connections between discoveries that mature across four centuries.  Each seem isolated, but build to the point that leads to the ultimate power of the atom.  Einstein is the right person in the right place at the right time to bring the discoveries together with great insight.  Just as Carl Sagan has said, it comes down to the fact that the earth and everything on it, including all life, is made of stardust.

How a complicated theory captures the simple fact that energy, light, and matter are one in the same is exquisite detective work.  E=mc2 leads to epiphanies in all fields of study.  It shows we are one with all the universe and gives us a full picture of how all began.

The documentary/movie was easy and interesting to watch.  I thoroughly enjoyed the learning experience and highly recommend it to all adults as well as junior and high school students.",1192320000,3,1399,4.927350427350428

The movie is both science and story telling; I did not expect the film to be about the lives of the scientists who came up with these discoveries, and I did not expect their stories to be so captivating.  Watching the actors portray a look of stunned grace as their characters are slowly made aware of the secrets of the universe was profound.

2420971,5,B000BKDO6G,"This is a 112-minute NOVA production directed by Gary Johnstone based on the book E=MC2 by David Bodanis.  John Lithgow narrates and Aiden McArdle stars as Albert Einstein.  It's the kind of documentary that melds interviews with scientists and historians with reconstructions of historical events by actors.  ""Einstein's Big Idea"" is a particularly good example of this genre.

Bodanis realized when he conceived the book that it wasn't enough merely to write about Einstein.  It was necessary to bring Einstein's precursors and their ideas and discoveries into the mix.  This film does the same and does it well.  Recalled is the story of Michael Faraday who discovered electromagnetic induction and that of Antoine Lavoisier who demonstrated the conservation of matter.  Worth noting is the influence of women in these stories.  Shirley Henderson plays Einstein's first wife and fellow physicist Mileva Maric while Ty Glaser portrays Lavoisier's wife, Marie Anne, who was a fine chemist in her own right.  Included is the sad story of Lise Meitner, Austrian born Jewish physicist, who was betrayed by fellow physicist Otto Hahn in Nazi Germany in that he won a Nobel Prize in large part because of work she had done.

What impressed me about this production was the fine acting by especially Shirley Henderson who is an outstanding actress, and Aiden McArdle who looked the spitting image of a young Albert Einstein.  Ty Glaser was also very good.  Johnstone's direction was first rate.  His ability to recreate various time periods in a realistic way should propel him toward a career adapting historical novels to the screen.

The film concentrates on the personalities of the scientists and their struggles and successes.  The actual science is secondary.  Consequently this is a good film for people, especially young people, interested in science but without yet a lot of scientific training.",1178582400,21,1900,5.197368421052632
2420972,5,B000BKDO6G,"First of all, the title should be something like ""Einstein and His Giants"" rather than the one NOVA gave. Although Einstein's E=mc^2 is the central role, related science evolution and stories of other scientists are well covered, too. Einstein's part only shares about one third of the total run time.

The arrangement is quite innovative. In the famous equation R=mc^2, E means energy and it brings up Michael Faraday and his story. In fact, people at that time think it in terms of powers or forces, not energies. Faraday proposed the force lines and explained the electromagnetism. In addition, m is the mass and Lavoisier is introduced for his discovery on law of conservation of mass. Due to his roles as tax collectors in Paris, he was executed after the French Revolution. Last, c means the velocity of light and James Clerk Maxwell is on the stage. He proved that light is a form of electromagnetic waves based on his excellent mathematical skill, which Faraday is lack of.

Other scientists and their contributions are also mentioned in this DVD. The background of their times, passion for the work, discrimination against female, betrayal, politics and even romance (well, maybe not so romantic) are included so that this film is quite colorful. Sadly, a good scientist usually accompanied with a bad marriage. Moreover, what seems to stand firmly today evolved a long time, one hundred years for example, for people or even scientists to accept.

Overall, this film documents certain part of the evolution of science. The actors and actresses portraying all the scientists in this film get the job done. It is juicy, refreshing and educational. This is a masterpiece deserving more than five stars!",1172534400,2,1709,5.01056338028169
2420973,5,B000BKDO6G,"Just about to put this item into my cart for purchase, having caught it in mid-stream on local PBS programming, sat down to watch, and decided to share my excitement about it. I have a layperson's interest in physics and reality and religion and spirituality, etc, and a familiarity with bits and pieces of each. But, until this program, I had never been able to ""wrap my head"" around the concept of E = MC2. Every program I watched, every book I read, presumed some basic intimate previous knowledge of how this works...a knowledge that I simply did not possess. E = MC2 has become a catchphrase, widely used and perhaps not as widely understood...a stepping stone to other realizations but, if you're behind the curve, good luck on getting someone to explain it succinctly to you. This presentation showed me the concept in a way that no other had done...and I finally ""got"" it. I've always been in awe of the Universe; this show helped put into terms that I understand, a bit of how that universe works...and of the historical consequences of humankind's unraveling of this piece of the puzzle.",1158710400,16,1097,4.71875
2420974,5,B000BKDO6G,"This is by far the best documentary I have ever seen and it doesn't even feel like one. Einstein's Big Idea truly takes you into the journey of light itself. It takes a hold of you from the beginning with its wonderful introduction into these people's lives and achievements, and it doesn't let go until the end. When you are watching the fascinating stories that make up the equation E=mc2, you relate to the characters and their struggles as if you were part of their discoveries. I specially offer a huge praise to the actor that portrays Einstein (the resemblance is uncanny) who makes you believe he is the icon himself. It is amazing how quickly your mind fills with questions and wonders beyond your average everyday thinking. It makes me wish I was a scientist in this period of time when all bets are off and not even God can tell you what to do.",1156982400,13,855,4.487179487179487
2420975,5,B000BKDO6G,"This program has more science than (Einstein Revealed, Newton's Dark Secrets and The Elegant Universe), although Newton's Dark Secrets has its moments.

Einstein's Big Idea is about the many contributions of earlier scientists leading Einstein to come up with E=mc2. It's also about the later usefulness of E=mc2 in nuclear physics. Unlike Einstein Revealed, which is a story almost entirely about the life of Einstein (private and public), Einstein's Big Idea is a story about science with its ups and downs. There are also some people stories as well, but they are added for dramatic value, which in my view helps instead of hinders the program.

I highly recommend this program for anyone who is interested in the evolution of scientific ideas (7 stars).",1146355200,34,757,5.096774193548387

8087728,4,B000BKDO6G,"Like others have said this documentary is by far the best PBS documentary out there. It's like watching a movie NOT a documentary (i.e. not boring). The subject is fascinating yet accessible and I hope PBS does more like this. Theonly other documentary to come close to this that I have found is Mysteries of Matter also by PBS - but it reverts back to the normal documentary style with movie-like sequences in between.

On a technical note my DVD also had white colored noise bars on the top and bottom of the frame. Not sure I want to exchange it because others said they got this also and I don;t want to spend months exchanging DVDs if it's just a bad lot. Perhaps that's why the DVD is offered at the price it is. Only 4 stars because of this noise - otherwise it would be 6!",1491350400,,780,4.27027027027027

8087731,5,B000BKDO6G,"Explains that 'Einstein's Big Idea' is just completing Faraday's and Maxwell's science. Wonderfully done!

Shows Maxwell's mathematical analysis of Faraday's science, forced Einstein's 'special theory of relativity'.

E=MC-2 is the most recognized mathematical formula. However, what does each symbol represent? This video presents the science - and even better - the human drama behind each one.

1. Introduction
2. Bern, Switzerland - 1905
3. E is for Energy - Micheal Faraday
4. M is for Mass - Antione-Laurent Lavoisier
5. c is for Celeritas - James Clerk Maxwell
6. 2 is for Squared - Emilie du Ch&aacute;telet
7. E=mc2 - The Holy Grail of Physics
8. Unlocking the Atom
9. E=mc2 - The Future

M - Mass, was Lavoisier's contribution. A French tax collector (who built a wall around Paris to impose tax), he also demonstrated that any substance annotate be destroyed, only changed. All forms, liquid, solid and gas have mass that cannot disappear. Touching reenactment of his marriage to a beautiful teen-ager - who became his talented scientific collaborator. Shows him led off to guillotine.

Presents the story of Emilie du Chatelet, brilliant mathematical mind, translator of Newton, and lover of Voltaire. She supported Leibniz against Newton's theory. She was right and changed science.

E = Energy - was Faraday's discovery. He claimed all matter is only energy bound up in atoms. Electric energy is just another form of matter. Light is only electromagnetic waves. He was ridiculed. Especially since he was self-educated, poor, a devout Christian and didn't understand or use mathematics.

Maxwell studied Faraday's work. Transferred it into marvelous mathematical formulas. Proved light is electromagnetic energy - in Faraday's old age. They became friends and shared their devout Bibical faith along with their 'heretical' scientific beliefs. Video reinacts Faraday's start from a bookbinders apprentice, janitor in laboratory, to most famous scientist in England. Inspiring!

Einstein's childhood fascination with magnets and compass, to distracted student is covered. His focus on female companionship and his marriage to a fellow physics student reveals a human side. His curiosity (obsession) with light drives his university days. Irritating his professors, skipping classes, reading philosophy did not prepare him for a job. When his friend told him to discipline him self, Einstein answered - ''I want to understand the mind of God'', not worry about money. So, he could not get hired. Finally, started working checking patents.

Nevertheless, in 1905 published four scientific papers. One, the special theory of relativity. Few years later, Max Plank, leading German scientist, sent for him. Soon world famous, and divorced. All this is done by dramatic recreation. Well done!

Last drama was Lise Meitner, Austrian Jewish physicist. Working for decades to understand the atomic nucleus of uranium and if it can be changed or split. Almost done and Nazi's forbid her to work. Escapes to holland and is stripped of her reputation. Poignant.

Concludes with the atoms bombs leveling Japan. Shows the supercollider using Einstein's mathematics to uncover more secrets.

This presention easy to follow. Focuses on the people, context and historical situation of each character. The dress, laboratory, hair style, buildings, etc., are all made to add color and authenticity. Viewer feels he is watching the actual person. Great!

Watched with my wife and eleven year old grandson. He enjoyed it. We both leaned a lot. Plan to repeat next year.

(See also, ''The Physics of Light'', a five hour video covering this subject. However, video also explains quantum theory. Well done!)",1482537600,5,3695,5.381282495667245

I learned things from this video that I hadn't fully before understood so it was just as enriching to me as it was to my students, and it's the sort of stimulus that invites you to dig more into some of the subjects that are presented in the film.",1452729600,,589,4.267857142857143
