8010529,5,B0001CWH3K,"I was very excited to see this film finally available on DVD. I originally saw this years ago at a San Francisco film festival on the big screen with Brian Flemming on hand for a Q & A after the screening. This film was ahead of its time in that, like the comedy ""Bowfinger"" they actually shot scenes in public forums without any prior knowledge, i.e. the scene in the town hall meeting.

In addition, this film diagrams and dissects the ""murder of Bill Gates"" like all those conspiracy shows currently flooding the History Channel.

This layered with the politics and dynamics of the ""citizen's group"" is what makes this indie film mysteriously compelling.

Other interesting trivia is that there are numerous actors in this film that are now breaking out on the scene. I suppose interesting stuff if you follow indie film scene like me. Most notably is Keythe Farley who plays the character Keith Charles. You may recognize his voice as Thane the Assassin in the video game Mass Effect 2. I also read that Keythe Farley & Brian Flemmings's ""Bat Boy - The Musical"" is getting buzz in Hollywood as a major movie release with John Landis slated to direct.",1265673600,,1154,4.674876847290641
8010530,5,B0001CWH3K,"this is a great underground movie... and it isn't *really* about the assassination of bill gates.  yes, old bill takes a bullet, but that's only the beginning.

the real story is about the forming and eventual destruction of a citizen's committee - the story of countless groups (including governments) that topple under the weight of hubris, greed, and internecine struggles.

the making of this film is pretty good too, considering that they shot a lot of footage for which they had no releases... and in public meetings where the actors got up and spouted off scripted statements related ot the plot of the film that must have sounded insane to the unwitting scene partners that included police commissions and town councils.

additionally, this film is offered to the public 'open source' - meaning that you can re-edit it any way you want... a bold concept, and one that should take hold in that hell of bad stories, hollywood.

truly a work of art, and a collector's item.",1232150400,3,978,4.832335329341317
8010531,1,B0001CWH3K,"An interesting premise becomes an exercise in tedium, and I found my self constantly hitting the fast forward button.  Everything goes on way too long; the characters get obnoxious very quickly, and the  payoff is pathetic. I suppose for legal reasons, the name ""Microsoft"" is never mentioned, but that contributes to the film's failure to create any sense of reality: if Bill Gates really was assassinated, you'd think people from his corporation would be involved in investigating a coverup. But this doesn't happen, so it all seems pretty dumb. By the end, I was mad I threw away $15 and over an hour of my time on this very amatuerish production.",1100044800,3,650,4.846846846846847
8010532,5,B0001CWH3K,"A serious subject is dealt with here in a very real manner. So much so that you actually think it happened!! You'll walk away really wondering - is Bill Gates dead? Did I just wake up and miss the biggest news story since the Kennedy assassinations? It's a good look at what might just happen if there was a real class war in the United States, and under investigation in the notorious Rampart police division of Los Angeles.  Like being fascinated by a car accident, you will find yourself mesmorized by the folks that are trying to get to the bottom of the mystery that surrounds this case.",1083110400,6,592,4.481481481481482
