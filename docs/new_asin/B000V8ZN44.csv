2933952,5,B000V8ZN44,this is a great musical from the time when movies were good. I saw it when it first came out & never forget about it. It is now on DVD & I am very pleased & bought it as soon as I found it.,1199318400,5,189,3.3181818181818183
2933953,4,B000V8ZN44,"It's an old movie with Mitzi Gaynor.  My father in law played the sax in the band she sang with. Unfortunately, scenes showing his face got cut out of the final edit. You can just see the side/body of the sax players. That's mainly why I bought it, so I was disappointed in that. Otherwise, if you like old musicals, it's a perfectly good one.",1386460800,,343,4.276923076923077
2933954,5,B000V8ZN44,"Having been a huge fan of Mitzi Gaynor since her first movie, I love every one that she has done.  So, anything she is in I would give 5 stars.  It's just a fun movie and I wish they still made musical comedies like they did.",1379548800,,225,3.869565217391304
2933955,5,B000V8ZN44,"Damon Runyon's ""Bloodhounds of Broadway"" (1952) is basically ""Kissin' Cousins"" meets ""Guys & Dolls""; as New York bookie ""Numbers"" Foster (Scott Brady) stumbles onto calico-clad Emily Ann Stackerlee (Mitzi Gaynor) in rural Georgia and takes her (and her dogs) with him back to his New York City nightclub.

Simply put, no Hollywood actress ever glammed up or plained down with quite the degree of erotic fantasy contrast of Mitzi Gaynor, or at least of a young Mitzi (and she was only 21 when ""Bloodhounds of Broadway"" was filmed).  The mind-blowing synergistic qualities of this disparity accounted for much of her popularity with audiences and producers, and gave a special sizzle to her most memorable films.  On the other hand, her performances in films that failed to showcase this disparity (like ""South Pacific"") had a sterile flatness.

""Bloodhounds of Broadway"" neatly exploits Gaynor's physical range, it is almost as if the storyline was written solely for this purpose.  Her transformation deliberately lacks subtlety because the whole point is to overwhelm the observer with the contrast, causing them to participate in producing the synergy of the experience.  It is plausible only because Gaynor has a unique physical quality which visually sells it, bookending the production at her most innocent with ""In the Sweet Bye and Bye"" and at her hottest (this side of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"") with ""Jack of Diamonds"".

The audience's reaction to the transformation of Emily Ann nicely illustrates the concept of a film as a semifinished product, to be used by the viewer to complete the artistic process rather than something they simply consume.

If you are buying the DVD used (or unsealed) be sure that the two-fold brochure and the 20th Century Fox envelope are included; the envelope contains four miniature black & white lobby cards on glossy heavy stock paper.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1374883200,,1930,5.117834394904459

2933961,2,B000V8ZN44,"The 20th Century Fox musicals for this era were,in my opinion, not as good as MGM products.

I found this film to be bright, colourful but boring with only 2 reasonably good songs/dances.",1202860800,,187,4.666666666666667
2933962,5,B000V8ZN44,"I am a big film fan and especially of films of the fifties (my era) but I never knew of this film. When I learned of it I bought it straight away and what an excellent film it turns out to be.  The young Mitzi Gaynor is such a star. Highly talented in all aspects -acting, singing and especially dancing. After this revelation I must see Golden Girl. Which I saw when I was  about twelve and I remember being impressed then. I just hope that it is brought out in as good a version as this DVD. I was impressed also with Scott Brady - as it seems was Mitzi Gaynor in the extra interview. He comes over very stylishly and is another revelation. A very good understated (In the best possible way) performance. A fifties film experience that is a total pleasure.",1201305600,11,758,4.256944444444445
