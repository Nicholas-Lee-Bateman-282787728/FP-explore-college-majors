211158,5,6300137511,"I love that this movie is on DVD. It reminds me of when I was a kid watching it with my brother and sisters. The movie is still a bit scary for younger children, but it still has a good story line as far as cartoons go with a good moral ending. Spoiler alert! ""I'll be your friend!""",1377302400,,282,3.8793103448275863
211159,5,6300137511,"Only 80's babies can truly appreciate this one!  I just watched it, and, judge me if you will, I cried at the end.  This DVD has the pilot episode, which I had never watched before.  It's definitely not as good as the movies, but it was interesting to see what Unico originally looked like.  The DVD is new and in great shape (no skips), though it seemed to take them a few days longer to ship it than it should have.  Still, I have it and love it.  It's priceless to me.",1375833600,,471,4.065217391304348

The only thing that scared me was that to opening graphics were in Japanese; but all the English audio was there and it was a region 1 disc too! (I've ran into regions issues from other venders before)
So we were very pleased with this purchase!",1358035200,,358,4.279411764705882

211177,3,6300137511,"I love this movie and so do my kids. I was a little disappointed that there are some places where the movie stops for a few seconds. I've bought another Unico movie without this problem, so it might have been my particular copy. Lord Kuruku is such a tragic character and its sad how Unico always has to go away. The living puppets are just as creepy now as they were back when I first saw it. It brings back good memories to watch it with my kids the way my grandma watched it with me.",1353110400,,486,4.072916666666667
211178,5,6300137511,"HELLO~ This has to be something collectable and rare, I never heard of this movie until I browsed amazon... I took it for a test drive on youtube. It is worth 14 bucks, a new cult classic collectable.",1345852800,,200,4.2894736842105265

211180,5,6300137511,":) I'm sure there are many others, like me, who have been wanting an official DVD for years (for both movies).  I like them both; love the other one better.  Kuruku always creeped me out a bit. :)

Anyway.  It's Unico; what more can I say.  If you loved Unico, then you'll love to have this in your collection; and for those, like me, who have unofficial VHS to DVD versions can put those to rest.

And I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had included the Pilot film on this dvd ('course it's Sub only).  Still, though: You buy one movie and get the mini-movie along with it.

I think I'm starting to love this Discotek Media company.  I love them for making these old goodies available to us.",1337817600,4,701,4.290076335877862
211181,5,6300137511,"This is the second Unico theatrical feature about the unicorn who must keep moving along to keep away from the jealous gods who wish him to be exiled.  This movie is much darker and sinister in tone than the previous movie, and not enough time is spent on Unico himself.  The secondary characters are not as memorable as the original either, but this is still a solid movie, even though the darkness is rather surprising compared to fare nowadays.  A strange magician holds nothing but hatred in his heart for living creatures and wishes to collect them all as living puppets to build his magical castle.  He crosses Unico's path by way of a young girl he befriends, and the adventure is on from there...

As for the DVD release itself.... hey!  It's Unico on DVD!  That's something we thought we'd never see in the first place!  Announced way back in 2007... it is finally here!  And it is in anamorphic widescreen, slightly cleaned up but the original grain left intact so it doesn't have that washed out appearance that some older movies have upon re-release.  The audio has suffered the most, as there is some crackling at the beginning especially but nothing too distracting.  The original dub is here and that's the main thing!

ALSO! An added bonus!  The 1979 PILOT FILM (called ""Black Cloud, White Feather"" but just labeled as ""Pilot"") is in the extras!  It is subtitled only, but what a great special feature to have!  This was produced to be a pilot for a tv series that was never picked up (Unico went into theatrical production instead).  This was a great surprise and not something that was expected.  It can only be found on THIS DVD, and is NOT on The Fantastic Adventures of Unico.
The pilot tells the story of a sickly girl named Chiko who has grown ill because of the smog surrounding her town.  It is being pumped out by a factory.  Delivering an ecological theme was the basis of the manga, and this sticks truer to it than the movies.

A must buy for any Unico fan or unicorn lover.  Kids still love this movie, big and small.  Mine sure did enjoy it!  It's great to have childhood treasures like this to share with your family.  Unico never disappoints.",1337212800,15,2175,4.560723514211887
211182,5,6300137511,"Disotek Media announced on their Facebook page that both Unico in the Island of Magic and The Fantastic Adventures of Unico  will have both English Dub and the original Japanese with English sibtitles. Amazon only lists the product as having Japanese language only with English subtitles, but this is false according to the company that is releasing both both movies.",1333843200,8,367,5.116666666666666
211185,5,6300137511,"Please release this movie dubbed in English, not just with subtitles so I don't have to wait for my child to be able to read to enjoy it! This was one of my favorites growing up!",1333756800,,178,3.9722222222222223
211186,5,6300137511,"This was a favorite when I was a kid. Scary for a cartoon. Those mean gods taking a poor defenseless unicorn away from his loved ones and abandoning him. Then that evil bubble guy Kuruku comes along and turns everyone into living puppets and he has to save the world all on his own. But then... I watched it as an adult and I wondered... Did they INTEND this to be funny? Melvin is such a scaredy-cat it is ridiculous. Toby's hair and costume are just funny. The way lips move (this is true in all Anime as far as I've noticed). The sphinx in general. Mostly, the giant screeching dragon... rolling about on wheels.

Well, none of that kept me from continuing to enjoy the movie.

(That one I never managed to get a copy of until I was an adult. I was surprised by the violence in that one.)

One thing I must mention: I absolutely love the flute melody Toby plays to bewitch the living puppets. Songs without words always bore me, but that is just the most beautiful song ever. I really wish I could get it on CD. Oh, and I named my dog Toby. I was so amused by Kuruku floating around, screeching the name Toby, I just had to.",1332460800,,1340,4.87280701754386
211187,5,6300137511,I loved this movie as a child and just had to have it as an adult so when it became available I jumped on it. It's wonderful!,1329436800,,125,3.6666666666666665
211188,5,6300137511,"I remember watching the Unico movies on vhs when I was a little girl, and absolutely loving them. Time passed, I grew up, and these films became a distant memory. Until I found them on Amazon. Never in a zillion years did I expect to find these movies again, especially on DVD! Needless to say, I was taken aback and immediately bought them upon stumbling over them while looking for Starlite horse stuff. I have a 4 year old daughter, and now I am introducing that cute little guy Unico to her.

""Unico in the Island of Magic"" is a film that we both throughly enjoy watching. The animation is really great for the time it was made (1981), and the storyline is easy to follow. Just be warned that you should watch this movie with your child the first or second time they view it, because the character of the evil wizard Kuruku and his antics of turning people into puppets might give some children the willies. It didn't phase my daughter, but all kids are different.

Just FYI, the other Unico movie is titled ""The Fantastic Adventures of Unico"". There are only 2 movies as far as I know, and, believe me, I have looked.

These are also great movies for any adult sci-fi or fantasy freak. Check them out!!",1320624000,,1207,4.427927927927928

While the movie works and works well, is good and has a good story the items itself were not legit and not what I had planned on getting.  If you're looking for the actual production of this film this is NOT it, but if you're just looking to see a really good classic anime, this might be right for you.",1300492800,4,447,4.2976190476190474

211222,5,6300137511,"Greetings;

I loved this as a child, and I do to this day. This, the second Unico movie is my favorite of the two. this particular dvd has only English Audio, no subtitles. The words that drift on by at the beginning and the credits at the end too, all in Japanese, which was not how it appeared in the original english dubbed version from my childhood. Not a real problem, mind you. And as a lovely added bonus, you also get the original pilot-Unico was originally slated to be a TV show that never seemed to get off the ground. Honestly, I have to agree. The pilot episode kind of stank, in my opinion-just so under developed. The concept did much better as 90-ish minute movies. The cover art was decent enough, dual languages, Japanese and English. Printed on a sheet of paper that was altogether pretty thin. Not a huge problem, other then the fact that is looks crinkled even when its not. Seems to be typical of overseas productions, which is what I have to assume this to be. Altogether, not a bad deal and even better for the nostalgia. I always identified with Lord Kuruku. Never seemed to get along with people, but I could totally see myself living in a place built from the various living creatures of the world-people included. Hell, people especially. So very evil, I know. Thank you...",1287619200,,1301,4.512711864406779
211223,5,6300137511,"I, like others, remember watching this movie as a kid in the 80's. There are certain scenes and characters that managed to stay with me over the last 24 years, popping up in dreams or just random memories of my childhood. When I finally discovered the movies title, after having long ago forgotten, I found it very quickly on Amazon and three days later it is in my possession! I cant wait to see just how scary old Kuruku is now that I'm grown.....regardless of that I am very happy to have a piece of my younger years back!",1265155200,8,525,4.313131313131313

211225,5,6300137511,"I bought this DVD along with the first one (The Fantastic Adventures of Unico) and received it within a few weeks. I watched these movies over and over when I was a kid and they were shown on TV; however, I could never remember what they were called when I finally tried locating them years later. I am SO HAPPY to have found them at last! Now that I'm older, I do find them just a tad sappy (the whole ""friend"" business at the end of this one kind of brings down the fight scene) but I still highly enjoy them. I'm a huge Manga-maniac, so finding treasures like these fills me with childish joy!",1227657600,7,596,4.191304347826087

211227,4,6300137511,I remember watching this back in the 80's. This one of the reasons that I'm hooked on Anime now. Great movie for children. Kind of spooked me out when the people and animals were turned into blokes and puppets. Very creepy.,1208563200,9,223,4.463414634146342

I only saw it once when I was 8 but I have been hunting for it for years. Once you hit a certain point you really cannot bring it up to other people without looking foolish. But now I will def. try to find it somehow. One of the best movies I ever saw at age 8.,1206662400,,374,3.573170731707317
211229,5,6300137511,"Classic delights of children, like toys and candy, can be twisted into garish tales of horror and yet hold us enthralled. Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and Gene Wilder's performance in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" are two examples of such ingenious films.

""Unico in the Island of Magic"" is another movie that can capture audiences with its fairy-tale story and charming wit. This is from a time before the razor-sharp sarcastic media have to modernize fairy tales. (Remember ""Grimm Fairy Tales"" from Nickelodeon? That's the long-lost quality I still crave for.) This is Anime working at its best: creating worlds of children's imagination while providing interesting that amuse adults too.

Our adorable noble magical unicorn has been dropped off near a quaint village that is soon to be attacked by a troublemaker. With the help of a plucky girl named Cheri, Unico must use his powers of love and friendship to stop the evil Kuruku and save the villagers. Brave little Unico's courage shines through in ways that sappiness does not and the film holds strength from start to finish.

Cheri is straight and honest as Unico but some other less-than-perfect characters really flesh out the movie. Melvin Magnificat is a bullying feline whose massive ego is quickly deflated when he's recruited by Toby, Cheri's older brother, to do his master's dirty work. Toby is also interesting. He's a misguided magician with a strong thirst for magic but his conscience is torn between love for his family and love for his work. He is reluctant but must carry out his master's orders to a tee.

The movie's plot revolved around the diabolical plans of Kuruku, a psychotic sorcerer who delights in turning humans into puppets and toys for his own amusement. With his bulging white eyes and a maniac high-pitched laugh, Kuruku ranks up there with the Joker's gleeful insanity. Yet he has a sympathetic side, as the audience learns that Kuruku was once a neglected puppet rejected by his masters.  Unico, ever the hero, pities Kuruku but must stand up to the fight and they battle as Kuruku's castle crumbles all around them.

I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one because the story flows smoothly and the bewildering scenes are equally enchanting. A vast burning desert keeps Cheri and Unic from their destination. Human puppet-droids move like building blocks in time to Toby's eerie flute music. The toy dragon, with his whizzing, screaming, and snapping mouth, is witty and horrific. Cheri and Unico undergo a temporary transformation and dance for Kuruku's pleasure. Even decades later, this film remains a breathless wonder in the eye of every person who can imagine when dreams and stories come to life.",1181001600,2,2733,5.008810572687224

One lady asked for information about this movie. Here it is in a nutshell.

In order to avoid being sent to the Land of Oblivion, by order of the Gods, the West Wind hides a small unicorn in a fishing town without any memory of where he came from. Unico only knows his name and an annoying cat quickly tries to kill him. The cat is mainly the comic relief for this movie. A wizard uses a magic flute to ""Pied Piper"" all the forest animals to one spot so he can turn them into ""Living Puppets"". After finishing the animals, the wizard's master, Karuku, orders him to start on people. All the people are taken to an island that Unico and a girl escape. The soon learn from the Trojan Horse that Karuku must be defeated with love and care. They soon return to the island to confront Karuku to a bitter end. Not much of a good ending but a good movie overall.",1133049600,6,1004,4.170103092783505

I first saw the second movie first, and had it for many years, but it was lost when I moved. I saw the first film some years later, but it dissapeared as well. Then a few months ago, I was feeling nostalgic and went online in the hopes that I might find someone with an old copy. And lo and behold, I found not one, but both films in mint condition. And Now, I HAVE THEM BOTH!!!! MWHA HAHAHAHAHA!

Okay, past my meglomanical monologue, Unico was the very first Anime I ever saw, back before I even knew what Anime was. I find it sad that it is out of print, but if it gained enough support, I am sure the Anime companies would give the go ahead for a DVD release. If anything, it would allow a lot of people to relive a simpler time, when a cartoon could touch a person so much that it would stay with them for so many years. And even after so much time, I am still in awe of the magic of these stories. A fond memory, of a forgotten treasure.

HEY OUT THERE!!! ADV!! Animego, PIONEER or anyone else. Fans demand. BRING UNICO BACK!!!!!",1098230400,12,1199,4.141630901287554
211250,5,6300137511,"This movie was more or less my first exposure to Anime when I was a kid and I have still have very fond memories of this movie even now as an adult.  Not having seen the movie for SEVERAL years, my memories about the characters and events of the story are somewhat scattered but I do remember that ""Unico In The Island of Magic"" was nothing like most of the cutesy ""kiddie"" cartoons that were heavily promoted when I was a kid.  Although I was raised on Disney like just about everybody else, I developed a deeper appreciation for ""darker"" movies with more mature and serious themes such as ""Unico,"" ""The Secret of NIMH,"" ""All Dogs Go To Heaven,"" movies that, in my opinion, better reflected ""real life"" with their mixture of happiness, humor, tragedy, and sadness and and movies that did not always have a ""happy"" ending.  I still recall ""Unico In The Island of Magic's"" bittersweet ending scene with Unico (once again) being taken away by the West Wind without having a chance to say goodbye to Cheri with a tinge of sadness even now, which I believe is indicative of just how good the movie actually is.  It is a rare movie that is able to touch me in such a way, especially several years after seeing it for the  last time.  While I believe that kids would definitely enjoy the movie, I think that many adults would enjoy watching this movie as well and us fans are already hooked. If you can get ahold of a VHS copy of this movie, grab it and hold onto it with all of your might, but hopefully SOMEBODY over here will give both of the ""Unico"" movies a proper DVD release, hopefully sooner rather than later.  I am encouraged by the current rate of release of 80's cartoon shows and I am hopeful that the recent DVD release of Unicorn-related movies such as ""The Last Unicorn (also originally produced and released in the early 1980's),"" might prompt some more studio interest in the ""Unico"" movies.  Sanrio, who released this movie as well as the first movie, ""The Fantastic Adventures of Unico (which I have NEVER seen but would like to),"" has unfortunately indicated that they will NOT ever re-release these titles on DVD here in the US so it will have to be up to other anime companies to look into this.  I know that I would love to be able to share these movies with my kids!  If there is anybody out there reading this who works for an anime production company looking for new products to acquire and release reading this: PLEASE Release the ""Unico"" movies On DVD!!!!!!!",1088985600,9,2481,4.481152993348116

211252,5,6300137511,"Like everyone else who watched this when they were young, I also had a hard time finding this movie. It would bother me to know that this movie, and a few other 80's cartoons where soo hard to find. I was very happy when I found this one. The story is extremely good and cute. Every character is really likable too. Truly my favorite anime story, along with the other one which I have to get (under fifty bucks that is). For all those who love 80's cartoons and anime alike should definately get this one.",1033430400,,505,4.270833333333333

It always made me cry at the end!  It was such a sad, yet beautiful movie!  I wish I could write plots like that!  I recommend it for anyone.",1032480000,2,308,3.734375

I just recall a cute unicorn, a girl that is turned into a doll and an evil (SCARY) wizard. But I DO remember LOVING this movie as a child.  This movie is HIGHLY recommended!",1026864000,,336,4.741379310344827
211255,5,6300137511,"For 9 years I searched for this video. I'm 17 now, yet I still remember how this movie thrilled, frightened, and enticed me as a child. My father and I watched it together once on tv. I fell in love with it, but I forgot the title, and so it dissapeared. I remembered the story, asked every video library about it, but no one knew what I was talking about. As a freshman I met some other girls who also vaguely remembered how much they had loved it, but not the title. I looked everywhere, and had just about given up. Then, one day, I came across it on Amazon and anipike. There it was! My long lost beloved movie. I finally feel closure, as if I found a long ago buried treasure. It is an amazing movie, and once I convince my dad, it is the first thing I'm gonna get from amazon!
I recommend it to all children and grownup unicorn lovers (as well as lovers of great simple anime) for it is heart warming. Just don't forget to write down the title...:)",1018483200,4,954,4.162162162162162

Movie works, has some early on sound issues but its very short in the first 10 mins there is some over modulation then everything is fine.
comes with a great bonus, the short film that inspired the unico series.
