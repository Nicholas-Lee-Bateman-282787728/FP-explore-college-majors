I was on a good many diets as most of you and like most of you no doubt missed the flavors that got us into trouble in the first place.  Ellie Krieger is a host of Food Nework's Healthy Appetite, author of many Healthy eating books, registered dietitian with a master's degree in nutrition, and an adjunct professor at New York University in the Department of Nutrition.  She knows quite a lot about food science.  I have cooked many of her wonderful desserts and savory recipes and unashamedly state that every single recipe is mouth watering, healthy and totally satisfying. I recommend not only her DVD sets but her books as well, and if you can watch her shows on Food Network, do so.  You can eat great and feel great.  No more useless diets and failure.",1332115200,10,866,4.443037974683544

These are some of the best healthy recipes I have ever come across and looking at Ellie; you know they work, not like some chefs who talk one way and LOOK another!
You go girl and keep up the good work.",1255392000,3,375,4.1506849315068495
