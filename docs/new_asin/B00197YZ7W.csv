I Just Love What the Dr. gets into, and out of. To Keep the show running. I especally like Tom Baker as the Dr.",1315872000,,178,3.58974358974359
8272412,1,B00197YZ7W,"I think the idea of a Dr Who collection is great but this price is absurd.  Even if you pay full price for all 27 dvd's yourself, its still going to be 1/4 this price.  27 dvd's X $20 each is only $540 and many of these dvd's can be found for $13-$15 if you look around so its even less than this.",1300147200,19,297,3.6984126984126986
