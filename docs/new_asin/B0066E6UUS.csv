4962466,5,B0066E6UUS,"I love these pre-coded Warner bros. movies.  I am  a huge Bette Davis, Jimmy Cagney, and Kay Francis (not the singer) but the actress of the 1930's.  There are so many things we learn about the 30's and 40's era.  Thank goodness for TCM, and also Amazon.  I have been looking for Side Street with Ann Dvorak and Aline Macmahon, to my mind a very under rated actress.  Although I was not born in this era, I love them just the same!",1394582400,2,431,4.195121951219512
4962467,4,B0066E6UUS,"I wonder how many old films have been destroyed or are languishing in some neglected vault somewhere. Occasionally and thankfully, an old film is dusted off and released for general viewing consumption. Me, I love old movies to bits, and I appreciate the hell out of the TCM channel on cable. Old cinema grants a peek into history and into a bygone era. THE NAUGHTY FLIRT and LOOSE ANKLES are only two of untold thousands. There's added gratification if you're a fan of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. or the more obscure Alice White.

Maybe THE NAUGHTY FLIRT's most prominent claim to fame is that it featured Myrna Loy in a supporting role, although she didn't really get much opportunity to strut her stuff, hampered as she was with the thankless role of the avaricious schemer. THE NAUGHTY FLIRT is a brief and negligible 1931 comedy. Bubbly female lead Alice White plays the spoiled socialite, Kay Elliott, who dedicates her life to endless carryings-on. The film opens with Kay and her cronies deep in festivities, celebrating her annual expulsion from a finishing school. When the party gets out of hand, the revelers are arrested and marched into the courthouse. There, giving in to impulse, Kay decides to get married to one of her constant suitors. At this stage, hard-working young attorney Alan Ward (Paul Page), who works for Kay's father, intercedes and carries her away from the protesting, impromptu groom. Kay doesn't at all take kindly to the lawyer's interference and she plots her revenge. And if you've seen any number of romantic comedies, you can probably chart the course of this film.

THE NAUGHTY FLIRT, barely over an hour long, is enjoyable, never mind that it's lightweight fluffery and it sometimes creaks noticeably. It was shot in an era in which an earnest spanking can turn a person around and one apparently remedies a heart condition with sips of brandy. The Cinderella dance - in which the ladies leave one shoe in a pile and the converging gents have to match the shoe to the owner to claim a dance - is a nice party diversion. But, yeah, mostly, I tuned in to this film for the Myrna Loy moments, few that they are. Loy is hands down my favorite actress of old Hollywood. But Alice White turns in a nice performance.

1930's LOOSE ANKLES is the better film, bolstered by zingy one-liners and a keen eye for the absurd and boasting a higher-profiled pair of leading actors. Free spirit Ann Harper Berry (Loretta Young, then only 17) stands to inherit a fortune if only she marries a reputable sort and remains free of scandal. Vexed by these conditions and by her rapacious relatives, Ann deliberately advertises for a gigolo to compromise her, and here comes Gil Hayden (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) willing to play along to temporary marriage in exchange for financial compensation. And, naturally, Ann and Gil fall in love. Fun and full of zest, LOOSE ANKLES is a pretty good early-talkie that trots out several highlight comedic moments. With just a whiff of salaciousness wafting in the air, this film serves as a precursor to the screwball comedies later in the 1930s and '40s. Somewhere in all this, Fairbanks, Jr. loses his trousers and Ann's prudish aunts get hammered at a speakeasy. Louise Fazenda as one of the aunts and Daphne Pollard as the maid who depants Fairbanks are a hoot.

Overall, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this double feature.",1344470400,16,3371,4.786941580756014
4962468,1,B0066E6UUS,"The Warner's Archive Collection had made available many rare films which otherwise would most likely never see the light of day.  This double feature is a good case in point.  Who would remember these titles from 1929 and 1931?  The only possible attraction could be the chance to see some big stars near the start of their careers.

""Loose Ankles"" pairs a 17 year old Loretta Young with a boyish Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. in a really weak farce about an heiress with conditions on her inheritance.  She advertises for a man to ""compromise"" her and Fairbanks, who answers the advertisement under duress from his buddies, falls for her. This is a very early talkie, copyright 1929 and released in early 1930. That means the terrible dialogue is stilted and delivered as for the stage, every word ""enunciated"" carefully with cast neatly arranged in front of the camera.  Louise Fazenda plays plays Young's spinster aunt for some appalling comedy. Eddie Nugent shows some animation, trying to give a charge to the dialogue and when he grins he looks like the young Tyrone Power. In Loretta's case, she demonstrates her ease in front of the camera and while she is very pretty, she is not yet the luminous star of her pre-code period. The film has a musical number in a nightclub too, typically tossed in like many early talkies and a mess of acrobats, dancers etc.

""The Naughty Flirt"" is an even weaker screenplay starring Alice White, a pert blonde kewpie whose lively image and career faltered a few years later under a cloud of scandal. The only interest beyond White is an early appearance of Myrna Loy as her rival.

The prints of the film are adequate, in fact, very good in the case of """"Loose Ankles"".  The DVD is made to order (not good), expensive and has no extras.",1342915200,6,1771,4.687096774193549
4962469,4,B0066E6UUS,"Loose Ankles is by far the better film of the two. It features a wonderful cast, of whom only the lead, a very young Douglas Fairbanks Jr., is a dud. He is, however, lovely to look at. Reliable Warner character player Eddie Nugent is absolutely wonderful as a cheeky gigolo and keeps the picture moving. Alice White does nicely in The Naughty Flirt and is the main reason to see the picture, Myrna Loy does not get to do much. Recommended for lovers of early talkies who have already seen quite a few of them.",1337558400,5,509,4.368421052631579

I have just received this double DVD. The DVD is two films on the one disc, a step away from many previous Warner Archive Collection doubles which were 2-discs. These two films are genuine Pre-Code delights in clean prints. Worth every bit of the money. The female leads are a very young Loretta Young and Dorothy Mackaill.",1329091200,10,533,7.075757575757576

I could not remember the name of the movie (Naughty Flirt.) and stumbled onto it recently on TCM. So I went on Amazon and bought it immediately. It is light pre-code entertainment and would also function as a flirting tutorial. Ha. Haven't watched ""Loose Ankles"" yet but guessing it is every bit as entertaining.",1486857600,,410,4.407894736842105
8494040,4,B0066E6UUS,"This was as surprising as could be for what was not on this disc.  There are no previews advertisements or Special Features.  Just the two movies.

The disc quality was good.  The main page says these are made for each individual order so I was worried, but the quality did not suffer.  The video was crisp and clear.  I did see a few jumps in video but I think that was due to the age of the print when copied.  There was also a background crack and pop on the sound that I am sure was due to the same thing.  Overall though good quality.",1472947200,,539,4.066666666666666
