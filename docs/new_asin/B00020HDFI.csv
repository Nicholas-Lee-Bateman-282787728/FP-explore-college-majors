2052658,3,B00020HDFI,"If you like to dance and your main goal is to get your butt off the couch, this workout is for you.  If you're looking for a good solid cardio workout with easy to learn but intense choreography that will get your heart pumping, go somewhere else.  All this workout requires is the ability to pick up semi-complicated choreography quickly and the inner strength not to yell at the video lead to SHUT UP already.

Pros: This is a lower intensity cardio workout.  For a beginner exerciser who enjoys dancing, I think it would be a great way to get into exercising to videos at home.  The DVD is chaptered, so if you only want to do one or two segments, that's pretty easy to accomplish.  If it were 1997, you could whip these dance moves out at the club and people might think you were cool.  I could really feel that I'd worked my abs after this video, but I don't do a 45 minute cardio workout with the expectation of only feeling it in my abs afterwards.

Cons: Oh, the instructor.  Oh, her ""attitude.""  The cheesy dance moves, the ""LOOKIT MEEEEEE"" backup exercisers.  This workout is cheesy as all get out, and it takes a lot of cheese for me to be distracted enough to not want to do a DVD again.  For the intermediate to low-advanced exerciser, this video is not a challenging cardio workout, and the lulls in between segments are long enough that your heart rate drops out of your training zone.  As with most workout videos, the stretching segment is too short.

I would have given this workout two stars if it weren't for the fact that I'm aware much of my problem with this video is personal preference and NOT that it's a horrible workout.  I think it's a great beginner cardio workout for people who'd rather dance than ""exercise.""  I think it's a lousy cardio workout for anyone who has been exercising in a serious way (4+ times per week) for more than six months.",1103155200,274,1876,4.425655976676385
2052659,4,B00020HDFI,"The tape consists for a warm-up, three ""workouts"", and a cooldown.  Each workout consists of two sets of steps, and each set has four steps.  I'm sweating by the end of the first workout, but I don't collapse if I do all three, so it provides a nice level of exercise.  The steps are generally quite fun, and each step gets its own soundtrack (the soundtrack was composed for the video, not a set of already-known songs)--the soundtrack changes provide an extra step cue.  FYI, the ""salsa"" part is a bit of a misnomer, since the second set is cha-cha.

You don't need much space, and it's easy to tone down any steps that may make downstairs neighbors irate.  It can take several tries to get all the steps down, but you get a good workout even if you're not doing the steps perfectly.  A couple of the leg movements aren't really explained, although the camera does zoom in for a better view of the legs.

Jennifer Galardi, being honest-to-goodness live fitness instructor at Crunch-Los Angeles, acts like one.  So she encourages you to ""give it your own style"" and ""get loud"" etc.  The only different is that they force her to give chirpy speeches to introduce and end segments, which are slightly annoying.  I really liked the background dancers--they actually looked like real people (all of them are fit, but lots of different body types--a couple don't even have flat stomachs!), and they all had different cute/funky outfits.",1100822400,24,1432,4.710843373493976
2052660,5,B00020HDFI,"I own 11 workout Videos/DVDs and this one I added to my favorites list.

When I FIRST GOT THE VIDEO: after reviewing the DVD I thought ""ugh! How cheesy & annoying"" So I tucked it away for another couple days.

The FIRST TIME I WORKED OUT: I thought this is great!  Since then I've really been digging it.

PROS: the dancing is fun and moderate enough to keep me in the workout zone for the entire 45 minutes.  The music gets stuck in my head & so do some of the movies (I've been doing some of the funk moves in my head for weeks now!).  Also, I do work up a sweat and if you do the moves right (i.e. the Ole) you will feel it in your muscles.

CONS: The background dancers are particularly annoying and seem pretentious, plus their outfits don't coordinate.  Small thing, but it does make a difference.  The choreography annoyed me at the beginning.  Many of the moves are done way too fast and it seems to me that if done slower, would provide more of a benefit.  Still, for me the pros outweigh the cons.

All in all, I recommend this video to anyone trying to get out of the ordinary workout routines (step, weights, sit-ups, etc.).  I prefer less traditional workouts like this one because they keep me enticed while still burning a lot of calories, within the same breath I must admit I know many people that prefer more standard workouts like the Firm series though.  Good luck in your decision, and remember that buying a video a month is still less expensive than going to the gym!",1099353600,19,1490,4.332129963898917
2052661,5,B00020HDFI,"If you love dancing, you will love this DVD.  Andrea Ambandos is creative, energetic and fun.  It will take you a couple of tries before getting the moves down but it will definitely get your heart rate up the first time.  Well worth the money!",1095465600,9,244,4.377777777777778
2052662,4,B00020HDFI,"My DVD just arrived today and I tried it out as soon as I got home.  I have to say that it is not a good video for a beginner and/or someone who does not catch on to moves quickly.  The steps are broken down but they are done so very quickly.  Also, the instructor is pretty cheesy with her ""attitude"".

However, I was definitely sweating by the time I finished the video and felt like I really had worked hard.  The video is fun.  I used to own all of the ""MTV The Grind"" workout videos, and I would compare the level of difficulty to those.

This is 1 of 3 Crunch videos I own and am very satisfied with them.  They have a good variety of body styles reflected in the participants and they make exercise fun.",1095206400,12,710,4.057553956834532

2052693,2,B00020HDFI,"I've been working out 5+ days per week for several months now, so while I wouldn't consider myself incredibly fit, I'm getting there. I like to mix it up, so I have a selection of a dozen or so DVD and Wii workouts that I select from each morning. I grabbed this one today and was looking to burn my usual 200-250 calories in 30-35 minutes. Unfortunately, it's incredibly lacking - after 19 minutes, I had only burned 59 calories, and my heart rate never went above 100 bpm. So ... if you're looking for something rather low-key, perhaps this is for you. I wasn't annoyed as some others have said, but I was disappointed that I spent 19 minutes doing so little. While it may be a fun way to learn some very basic dance moves, it does not burn fat as the title implies.",1398124800,,768,4.267123287671233

There are three dance portions, which are all different lengths and have no clear beginning or end until the cut-screen comes. I enjoy most of the moves, and it will get your heart rate up, but Galardi seems to lose track sometimes and randomly begin a new movement with no warning.

This is a fun occasional workout, but there are better available.",1325635200,3,611,4.754716981132075

I own almost all her DVDs and I've loved all of them. I don't know what it is about Crunch, but they somehow managed to make me want to strangle her.

Whenever I get a new workout DVD, I preview it before I try it to get a feel for what's coming. With this, I could barely stand to fast forward through it. Everything about Crunch is just big and corny and somehow Jennifer sucked that energy in too and I couldn't even stand listening to her. The dance moves looked like the would have given my big butt a good workout, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I threw it back in the box and put on Jennifer's Sweating Sexy.

2052737,3,B00020HDFI,"""Crunch:Fat Burning Dance Party"" is a fun beginner/intermediate dance workout VHS/DVD led by Jennifer Galardi who teaches dance moves from Latin, Hip-Hop, and Disco.  It includes a great 5 minute warm-up with some easy dance moves and plies, and a great cool-down with stretches for the legs.  It is a DANCE video so expect to dance with the following 5 minute segments:

Salsa 1-This routine was a mixture of Salsa and Mambo.  There is about 4 8-counts when you do the full routine from the top during the breakdown which is the time when you do all moves one time 2-4 times through.  Very basic.

Salsa 2-This routine is a mixture of Cha-Cha and Paso Doble.  Once again 4 8-counts when you do the breakdown.  This one is dancier than the Salsa 1, so I found it more fun.

Funk 1-This routine has a bit of stomping and hopping.  It has 6 8-counts which are composed of 3 moves done on both sides.  It is definitely hip-hop with Jennifer incorporating a lot of arms/elbows.  A little higher cardio that either of the Salsa routines.

Funk 2-This one is easier than Funk 1 with some basic grapevines, lunges, walks, and a fast move called the Double Dutch.  It is about 5 8-counts.  Although a little faster, the moves are more basic, and they are easy to learn.

Retro 1-This is the easiest to learn as it just 4 8-counts, but all you have to learn is 2 8-counts because they are done on both sides.  It is very ""Saturday Night Fever"" with John Travolta style arms and moves that you, if you are familiar with Disco dance, will know.

Retro 2-This one is about 5 8-counts with steps such as the Hitchhiker and the Backbreaker.  It is a lot of fun and it is cardio.  Less disco than Retro 1, but it is still Disco dance.

This a great workout for beginners to dance, and intermediates will like it if they throw themselves into it.  Those who are advanced might want to skip this one unless they need a workout for a ""light day.""  The reason I gave only 3 stars is because there are so many better dance workout DVDs on the market.  Get this only if you are beginner/intermediate or you just want to dance!",1260576000,4,2105,4.393782383419689

2052739,5,B00020HDFI,"I agree with most of the reviews here. I just wanted to add that many  dance workouts can be monotonous and very low impact. This particular dance workout does better than most (see also Tracey Mallett's Cardio Boot Camp which is also dancey). The steps were a challenge, but there was enough repetition to get the hang of it (of course, the director did too many sweeps and cuts to make it easy to keep along).

You can make the workout a little more intense by weighing wristweights.

Finally, I wanted to acknowledge the wonderful techno music by Daveed, whose music are also for sale as mp3s on amazon.",1255910400,,606,4.541284403669724

She also has a good rapport with the dancers who help her demonstrate the dances/exercises. I appreciated having those other dancers, all of whom aren't a size 2 like Jennifer or impossibly perfect; they feature one man who's a fantastic stepper, a large blonde lady who can really shake it, and a girl with dark hair and eyes who is downright adorable (the one Jennifer hugs at the end of the DVD). Everyone moves well and seems to be having a great time.

As a middle-aged man, I found it a bit difficult to exactly match the dance moves shown on my screen, but my ""approximations"" were fun and got my heart started in the morning.

I noticed that Jennifer gets increasingly ""animated"" (goofy) as the workout proceeds; must be the endorphins kicking in. I found that delightful.

I thought that the steps were fairly easy to follow once I did the program a couple times.  I enjoy all three of the dance segments, being able to do three different types of dance.

I have tried to use it a few times and can not get into this DVD. It is very difficult for me to enjoy a DVD that I do not understand.

2052753,1,B00020HDFI,"I didn't even sweat, I bought this dvd thinking I was going to burn some calories, but nothing. As an instrutional dance video it was ridiculous (basic steps from the 80's).

2052754,2,B00020HDFI,"I have several Crunch videos and this is my least favorite.
The moves are simplistic, and frankly, silly. I saw one reviewer describe the choreography as ""cheesy"" and I would have to agree. I saw several reviewers say the moves were too ""dancy"" but the DVD is called ""Fat Burning DANCE Party"". I'm an intermediate excercisor, and I don't find the moves hard to follow, but I had to do the DVD a few times to nail all the moves. There are 2 dances for each themed segment: ""Salsa Party"", ""Party Funk"" and ""Retro Dance Party"". A big problem I have with the DVD is that in each dance segment, there is usually the same basic steps for the feet, with perhaps slight changes in the arm movements, or in the direction of the feet movement, which makes the dances boring. Each dance is short, and the DVD moves along quickly. The moves are just so inane that I dislike doing the dances. Additionally, I have bad knees, and some of the moves are hard on my knees. In several places, the instructor doesn't mirror correctly; she instructs you to lead with your right leg, but if you were to lead with your right leg, you wouldn't mirror the dancers. Cueing in the rest of the DVD is good. The instructor also keeps calling the first 2 dances ""Fiestas"" when the dances are titled ""Salsa Party"". Of course, this is just semantics, but it shows the attitude the instructor takes overall. I don't think it's a good cardio work out at all. As usual, I find the Crunch dancers annoying, but I give Crunch credit for picking dancers of various racial backgrounds. If you really like workouts that include lots of dance moves, and don't mind doing silly choreography, you might enjoy this DVD.",1215475200,,1676,4.516447368421052

This video has 5 parts, warm-up, 3 dance parties and cool-down.  I do the warm-up, one dance party and the cool down for about 30 minutes a day.

In the evening, it's time to have some FUN, and for this, dancing is my favorite way to get some extra fat burned. Jennifer Galardi is such a great dancer, and her enthusiasm is infectious.  She gives such thorough instruction in the ""Crunch"" tradition, where she first goes through each move slowly in half-time, and then once you have it down, she does it in real time.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to dance, while getting a great cardio workout.  It makes me sweat, while it makes me smile.

  This starts off with a short warm up and stretch, then goes into three different dance ""parties"": salsa type moves, hip hop type moves, and something called retro, that I have not really seen much of in my lifetime anywhere. (The instructor must have been to different clubs in her heyday than me!)
  The quality of the videos are high, produced well with a nice workout studio background. Jennifer, the instructor, is easy to follow and has a lot of rhythm that I wish I had. Personally, I probably look more like a funky chicken than a funky dancer when I am doing this. But I stayed moving, and bottom line, I sweated.

I have always been rhythmically challenged, find it very difficult to do dance routines, after doing it twice I was able to keep up and I kept laughing at myself imagining how stupid I probably look. There are three workouts, and you pick one if time is an issue or do them all back to back.

All in all, if you're very atheletic or if you want a more structured serious work out, this probably isn't the work out for you. There isn't any strength training involved, so soreness isn't really going to be an issue.

In this Crunch workout, she seems a little nervous and not very comfortable in front of the camera.  She cues well...however, I could have used a little less talk about my butt (ie - shake your butt, stick your booty out, etc)!

There are three different dance styles in this one:  Salsa, Party Funk, and Retro Party.  The Party Funk segments were my favorite.

There's quite a bit of twisting in this workout, which will make it tough for people with carpeted surfaces to do this workout.  There's also some impact, which is pretty easy to modify down.

I like this one enough to keep, but I will most likely favor doing Dance Off the Inches Hip Hop Party over Fat Burning Dance Party.

2052764,2,B00020HDFI,"I do not like this video. I've only done this a couple of times, so maybe after four or five tries you can get the moves down, but I found them to be too complicated. I just couldn't follow along, which meant I had to stop a lot and that ruined the work out.

Also, both the moves and the instructor are cheesy. I read someone's review who agreed that the moves were cheesy but thought they were still fun. I disagree. Maybe if the instructor didn't act like these were cool dance moves and the back-up dancers didn't cheese it up so much I might have enjoyed it, but it was all a little too over the top for me.

On top of all that, it's just not a good work out. It didn't get my heart rate up to near where I would have liked. If you like cheesy moves and annoying instructors, and need a lighter to moderate cardio work out, then this video would be good for you.

I read reviews and somehow (maybe I got a head injury while doing this?) I deemed this dvd to be the best. I was so, so wrong. Now, I'm not totally uncoordinated. I can follow dance steps but the instructor in this dvd gives you about FIVE seconds to get down the moves before she breaks off into another set. There is no direction, little explanation and she touts off with these code words of hers that she doesn't even explain to the viewer. Also, there is no shot of her footwork from HER point of view, so you can't even get the moves down because you spend the whole time trying to figure out which foot TO move. By the end of the whole Salsa section I was just mad. Mad at Mrs. Perfect Abs and her ""work it out"" attitude, mad at Mrs. Bad Yellow Pants, mad at the lack of Salsa and mad at the whole thing. Then the rest of the dvd is disco and ""funk"" dancing. AKA early 1990's aerobics video style. I felt completely stupid doing them and didn't even finish the dvd. It was pointless. I am returning this dvd TODAY.",1195948800,3,1190,4.178260869565217
2052766,1,B00020HDFI,"I don't think my heart went above its standing rate during this entire video.  I'm probably fitter than average, but I'm confident that this workout would be painfully slow for anyone.  If you are looking for a low impact, get-off-the-couch type workout, taking a walk or turning out your ipod and slowly marching in place will burn lots more calories.  I'm not being sarcastic.  It's that slow.

Maybe, only maybe, I could forgive the lack of workout if the dancing was fun. It isn't.  Nothing about this experience feels like a party.  The background music is minimal.  The dance moves aren't impressive, but you do have to slow down to follow them and it would be hard for beginners(lots of single-single-double).  The moves are also nothing that you could ever bust out on the dance floor with a straight face.  I felt self-conscious the entire time.

2052768,5,B00020HDFI,"As many prior reviewers had mentioned, the cardio and impact aspects of this video is on the lower side, which works for me (middle aged and too many pounds)!  It took me awhile to catch on to some of the more complicated dance steps.  The instructor does a nice job of starting out with a simple move and then building from there.  I prefer this approach over teaching the steps in half time.

After mastering the feet movements first, I then worked on the arm movements.  All in all, it is complicated enough to keep me thinking and interested.  I much prefer this over a simple, repetitive routine.

I thought the instructor did an excellent job.  She gives ample time to cue the viewer on what is coming up...including the correct ""mirror-type"" cues for the left and the right foot.  I've tried 3 different dance videos and this is my favorite so far due in large part to the instructor.",1184198400,5,891,4.51875
2052769,5,B00020HDFI,"This DVD has three sections--Salsa, Party Funk, and Retro, each of them immensely fun. Chances are that if you tried busting these moves out in a nightclub, you would look like a complete DORK. But I think that's part of the appeal! If you take yourself way too seriously and refuse to do something that doesn't elevate your cool factor, no, this is NOT for you. However, if you want a great cardio workout and don't mind looking silly and yes, a little corny, get it NOW.

DIFFICULTY: First of all, I seriously can't dance for my life. Though I thought the cueing was OK, I needed to rewind certain moves like 2, 3, 4 times before I finally got it, but I honestly think that's to be expected with anyone who isn't a dancer. I didn't get frustrated though, because I WANTED to get them because they were so much fun! And when I got them and did them without stopping, they were very tiring, but doable. Why? Because of how FUN they were!

THE INSTRUCTRESS: Oh, how many times have I stopped using a fitness DVD or exited a class at the gym because I couldn't stand the voice or speech of the instructor. Jennifer Galardi, though she is energetic, does not go over the top with loudness or idiotic banter. Just enough to keep it interesting and funny. =)

THE SET/MUSIC/CAMERA: The set is very nice, spacious, and colorful, the music is not AWESOME, but certainly not irritating. It's mostly there to set up the beat for the dances. The camera occasionally does an odd angle that makes it harder to follow the dances, but it's not terrible, especially if you've established the rhythm.

THE BACKUP DANCERS: All women, except for one guy. None of them are model types, and a few are quite curvy. But all of them are beautiful, and all of them look like they are having the time of their lives, which is very inspiring. And all of them add their own personal flair to the dances, so everyone is a little different in their movement, expression, and attitude, which is fun.

Overall, it's a great workout, and it made me sweat like a pig, but I was smiing like an idiot by the time it was done. I can't wait to do it again!",1182902400,12,2119,4.395408163265306

It is true that when I first did this workout - and probably the second and thrid time - I was frustrated and decided to just go running instead because the moves were seemingly complicated. It's a DVD, though, so it's pretty easy to press rewind and replay a few times so that you can get the move down. By the fourth time doing it, I felt like I was getting the hang of it - and Now, I just plain enjoy it. After you have the moves down, you don't want the instructor to be going over the moves slowly every time.

The instructor is not annoying to me. She was encouraging and fun.

I have enough fitness that I find it to be a good workout. Perhaps the key is getting the moves down well and then executing them with energy.

The instructor is totally adorable to watch, has a great body, looks great doing everything, and does not insult me with irritating motivational hollering.  She just gives some counts and acts enthusiastic. That's what I want in a video exercise instructor.

I don't get all the moves perfectly.  If it were so easy I could do it all the first time, I'd be bored with it too soon.  I don't care what I look like in the privacy of my own home, so if some of the moves are goofy, who cares?  That means, yes, there are some goofy parts.

My experience with exercise dvds in the past has been that they all have pretty cheesy music and this one is no exception.

Finally, I will say that a lot of these moves are standard aerobic class kind of moves - vstep and grapevine (well, that's a dance move, too) - so for some people I can see where they may not feel like it's all dancing.  In other words, do not feel that you can hit a salsa club after doing this dvd because you will not be learning hot new moves that you can take out.

From the reviews, I would say this dvd is great for beginners or people who haven't done a lot of cardio in a while.  If you can't keep up with the arms and knee lifting and kick stepping, just improvise till you get it.  Advanced cardio junkies probably will not find this challenging enough.

2052790,4,B00020HDFI,"Mix this workout with other workouts that keep your heart rate higher, it is purely an invitation to the dance. In particular, people like me who are past 50 and in good health are encouraged by experts to maintain and increase weight training, and this video provides none. I suppose you can add hand weights but my experience teaches me that this can cause painful injury.

Aesthetically, it's not great: Jennifer looks terrific on the cover but forgot to wash her hair on the day the video was made.

Other reviewers decry the way old Jen teaches tacky dance moves. However, a neglected part of aerobics, in my view, is the ability to gracefully follow instructions and learn a step: many people, especially men, who'd benefit from aerobics avoid it because literally they cannot follow commands to do things with their body: they have no experience in it (military service counts: in it you learn your left foot from your right: but in this age of the chicken-hawk, poor and lower middle class people make up the bulk of the trainees).

Personally, I like the way she breaks down tacky dance steps. Sure, they were improvised on Argentine wharves and San Francisco gay bars by out-groups and as such it's a bit of a lie to ""teach"" them: but in my view, it build psychological and physical health to learn them and keep a straight face.

The rock group Franz Ferdinand says it formed itself to play music for the girls to dance to. These aerobics disks are heavily biased towards women's needs, but there is a token guy (as well as a diversity of body types, including an exceptionally graceful fat girl who can shake quite a lot of ""thing""). In an era in which a man can't dance unless he is learning how to kill, I find these cheesy and marginal tapes both eye candy (despite the lack of shampoo) and useful as part of a broad-based exercise plan.

Any coach who insists that you ""must"" keep your heart rate up above a threshhold is ignoring, I think, the aesthetics of exercise. I realize that the school can hardly teach physical education, and as such teaching, in PE, grace of movement is a nonstarter. But the result is the Trogdolyte of the city who knows he's been cheated out of Prometheus' legacy, and takes out his hatred in fundamentalism.

Gym philosophy, in my experience, has followed a dialectical curve: in the Fifties, it was a shadowland of homophobia and closet cases. The Sixties, in the New Games and early aerobics movement, said that all movement was good even if, perhaps especially if, you weren't puking at the finish.

Then, the commercialization of the phenomenon, and the unspeakable Schwarzenegger, dialectically returned gymnosophism to the shadowlands, a world in which only marginal characters feel at home, because the commodification has reified so many new categories of gym rats that people are afraid anew of transgression: women don't want to be ""too"" muscular, and male gym rats don't want to be ""twinks"".

Missing is of course freedom once again.

Plan Nine from Outer Space is to insist on being marginal.",1142121600,4,3052,4.754253308128544
2052791,1,B00020HDFI,"This video is all hype and delivers nothing.  I love dancing.  Dancing in this video is horrible.  For the latin section, there was hardly anything LATIN about it!  It was like she took some aerobics moves and added latin words to them.  Ick.  Not to mention it's hip hop music in the background with a small segment of horns added.  I love Latin dancing and didn't enjoy this at all.  The other dancing sections were equally cheesy.  They were soo cheesy I just felt like an idiot doing them.  If you are not at a stage in life where you still go to clubs/go out, i.e. 40+ then you MIGHT enjoy this.  If you do currently go out dancing, it's just going to be torture.

As for the workout, very low-intensity and lots of lulls as another reviewer said.  Definitely not for anyone who enjoys real dancing (because this is horrible) or an advanced exerciser because the workout does not keep your heart rate up.  I wouldn't even recommend this for a beginner because the choreography and direction are way too clumsy.  I think that would make a novice exerciser feel awkward when really it is the video and instructor that are the problem.  Don't waste your money....  there are lots of better vids out there.

The warmup and cooldown are adequate and unmemorable. The dance segments range from ""hey, this is pretty fun and sassy"" to ""boy do I feel stupid doing this."" I liked the Salsa one best and it's hard to decide between the Funk and Retro which one I liked the least--they were both pretty bad.

I don't think it's necessarily that this is such a bad workout as maybe it just wasn't the right workout for me or the right dances for me (other than salsa). The people in the video look like they're between their teens and mid-20s so I kinda feel like their grandma trying to ""get down and funky"" with them. I'm used to working out to DVDs featuring people whose fitness levels and body shape I would want to emulate. Beyond the instructor, there was maybe only one other person on this workout whose body shape I would want to emulate. Pretty much, it was a lot of young girls wearing belly shirts where there was more belly than shirt (and I don't mean that in terms of skin showing but in size of belly showing).

The instructor was okay at cueing at some points and terrible at others. It felt very inconsistent to me. The dance segments were a series of steps that you were taught in groups and then got strung all together. This method is definitely not my favorite. But at least these sequences aren't as long or as complicated as some of Kathy Smith's workouts.

I did work up a bit of a sweat and got some heavy breathing going so I do think it is at least a somewhat effective workout, but I felt really silly doing just about everything but the salsa segment and I LOVE to dance.",1131840000,9,1753,4.401234567901234
2052805,3,B00020HDFI,"If there is anything I've learned, it's that when reviews for fitness items are very mixed, it's just best to try things for yourself.

After reading all the reviews for this item, I had expected Jennifer Galardi to be overbearing, irritating, obnoxious. I love her! She reminds me of the instructors in any aerobics classes I've ever had - she's young, gorgeous, fit - what matters to me when it comes to instructors in videos, is that they are someone I would want to look like. She definitely has a body I'd want!

I also expected the coreography to be difficult, and dated. It wasn't hard, it was challenging certainly, easy to get after the first run-through. It's fast, I suppose, but really not complicated. It's not as dated as I expected, it's fun! It's got a good vibe, you're not just marching in place, it's got a dance-feel to it, and you feel good. It really does go quite fast. My favourite section, suprisingly, was the latin section.

My third expectation was for it to be easy, in terms of a physical challenge. It's not the most challenging video I've used, but I sweated, moved, got my ass off the couch, felt good, and that's the bottom line. I'll use it in conjuction with some muscle work for 20-30 minutes or so.

The DVD certainly isn't a high-intensity cardio challenge like those by Cathe Freidrich, but if you're willing to be patient the first few times through to learn the moves you can work up a sweat.  The choreography is somewhat challenging at first and Ms. Galardi's cuing is sometimes a bit tardy, but persistence is rewarded.  The moves certainly aren't anything that I would take out onto the dance floor at a local club, but that's not particularly significant to me. I don't mind looking like an out-of-date dork in the privacy of my own home, as my goal is to get my heartrate up for a decent workout.  I think the cast of this video recognizes that the moves are goofy and tries to have fun with it, which makes this a pleasant change from some of the more deadly-serious types.

One positive element of the supporting cast is how diverse they are - not everyone in this video is a rail-thin twig, and there are several participants who would look equally at home doing this DVD right alongside you.  I'm always heartened to see ""normal"" people in exercise videos, so the cast was a small touch that I appreciated (even if the outfits some of them decided to wear are appalling, fashion-wise).

The production values of this DVD are quite good and the camera work allows you to see what's happening at almost every point with no ill-placed cutaways, which is very helpful when the steps get more complicated.

If you like Ms. Galardi as an instructor, you might also try Minna Lessig's Optimizer - Balanced Blend, as Ms. Galardi is one of the supporting cast on that DVD.",1122595200,4,1717,4.5519480519480515

I break a sweat and can feel my heart pumping a lot of the time, and I'm active and in pretty decent shape for mid-thirties.

The instructor is a bit perky but no more annoying than most IMO. As far as the other people, that's not something I generally care one way or another about, but I thought it was kind of nice to see that they weren't all 95 pounds with washboard abs-they looked like real people and didn't make me feel like a lazy, clumsy, slug just by looking at them! I thought the dance moves were fun, haven't been to a dance club in awhile so I don't know if the steps are passe, but my goal was to get a workout, not learn how to dazzle a bunch of twenty-one year olds on the dance floor.  I agree with another reviewer that some of the moves are a bit hard on the knees, but like most aerobic workouts you can self-modify them a bit to avoid injury.

I would hate a lot more instruction, because I like the fast pace of the video and would get bored having to go over and over the same thing every time I used it.

I understand this is necessary in order for it to be a cardiovascular workout, but I think it could have been done in a better way.  Perhaps less moves per ""routine"" or less complicated moves overall.

I can't say I was impressed, I was more frustrated then anything because they went to fast for it to be possible to catch on.  I more or less just kept walking in place with a few hops, etc. and looked like a fool.

That bad part is, besides Jeniffer (who can only dance hip hop, not Latin), the only ones who can dance more is the guy & african american girl & they're mostly off camera. Having more people to talk to & see is fun, but better if they can dance at all.
The workout has several chapters, warmup, 2 latin dance, 2 funky, 2 retro all in 43 min.
The warm up was mostly dance steps, the latin... ooyy... some mambo, some cha-chas... but other then that... she doesn't even tell them to open up the hips... She puts way too much emphasis on keeping the arms parallel to the ground when should just move along with the body...
The funky was a bit better, some simple 90s dance steps, easy to follow for the most part, for one or two moves, you might want to have the pause/slow button handy for those who are uncoordinated like me.
The retro party part... oyyy... some hip hop, but one even Saturday night live ala John Travolta...
This is great for people new to dance exercise or two left feet. This is about a moderate workout... not slow, but not that demanding either, she does slow down to step touches or slower moves in between the more jumpy ones.
I think she has great cues.. but some of the moves were cheesy & Jennifer can only dance hip hop & even then she is a little stiff, not something you totally want to emulate.

  The first one is Salsa Party, followed by Party Funk and Retro Party.
  So the first one is modified Salsa and is not too bad choreography for a workout in that it is repetitive but not too repetitive (unlike some that are more dance instruction than a workout, for example).
  Although the 3rd dance is called ""Retro Party"", really the 2nd ""Party Funk"", is too.
  ""Party Funk"" is circa 70's and 1980 and ""Retro Party"" going way back, is circa 60's and 70's. At one point the instructor Jennifer calls a step "" a little John Travolta.""
  Is retro the style for young people these days?.  I am in my 30's. I just didn't like this style. I would have given it 2 stars but gave it 3 because I thought the instructor gives clear directions, it contains good workout choreography, it keeps the heartrate up through the video, at least for an intermediate exerciser like me who works out 3-4x a week, and because I like the instructor's personality and attitude which is upbeat and she encourages individual style.",1107302400,7,1121,4.472906403940887

I don't think someone who is fit would find this DVD a challenge but it's a nice, moderately intense workout for a beginner like me. You'll have lots of fun.",1459468800,,464,4.202247191011236
