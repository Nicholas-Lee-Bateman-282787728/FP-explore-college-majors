While it goes in other directions as well, this story mainly focuses on the finding of a large cache of royal mummies.  At 39 minutes, I would have preferred it to be longer, but for what it is this story is a great introduction to the world of Ancient Egypt and of course, mummies.",1259020800,,425,4.367088607594937

3924057,3,B002FUIIZW,"Oh what a time it was being a King of Egypt some
3,000 years ago.  Not only were you worshipped as
a God and had temples built in your honor along the
Nile, but upon death, your body was perfectly
preserved through the process of mummification.

Secrets of the Pharaohs examines one of the world's
greatest phenomenons - Egypt's Mummies.  Narrated
by Christopher Lee, this 2007 IMAX presentation
combines convincing reenactments of Egypt circa
1267 B.C. along with footage of top scientists and
their studies into forensics that could perhaps lead
to medical breakthroughs for modern day cures.

Viewers of this documentary learn that Egyptian
priests created the first mummies ever known.
The Kings loved life and wanted to live beyond
death.  They believed that dying was a gateway
to the next world where a paradise awaited them.
The mummification process ensured that the spirit
of the body was prepared for the afterlife. However,
for the longest period of time scientists had no
idea to the secret ingredients used for embalming.
Enter Bob Brier, one of the world's foremost
experts on mummies.  He is also one of the first
modern-day scientists who have been able to
actually duplicate the mummification process.

Secrets of the Pharoahs presents a wealth of
history for anyone with a hunger to learn about
these ancient times.  For instance, viewers will
learn about Heinrich Brugsch who cracked the
heiroglyphic code which led him to the discovery
of King Rameses II's tomb in 1881 with the help
of some local tomb raiders.

Of course we get to see footage of lots of mummies
courtesy of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs lives up to
the benchmark that these IMAX presentations
are known for.  The panoramic Egyptian environment
is so effectively brought out in razor sharp detail
and enhanced with the dimensionality 3D offers
that it becomes a stunning watch.  There is a
great deal of depth perception here though rarely
does anything poke out of the screen except for
the opening and closing titles and a quick shot
of mummy toes.

Ghosting can be a recurring problem here due
to the fact that there is a lot of footage taken
in dark environments such as caves lit by torch
fire, which results in double imaging.  Not a huge
problem by any stretch but worth mentioning.

The accompanying audio soundtrack is rather
potent and immersive.  Dialogue is handled
firmly in the center speaker while music sweeps
across the remaining tracks with clarity and
force.  The rears aptly support effect noises
that include windswept rain and crashes.  There
is also an abundant amount of LFE activity that
supports the film's sound effects and music. In
all, the soundtrack is the perfect companion to
the 3D visuals.

The disc includes a ""making of"" documentary
which was shot in High Definition.

One of the things that I enjoy most about these IMAX
discs is that they give me an incredible amount of insight
into modern and historical research -- taking me to the
farthest corners of the Earth, and sometimes beyond its
outer boundaries.

If you are looking for an eye-popping 3D thrill-ride
experience, then Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs
is not for you.

However, this mildly entertaining documentary will be
enjoyed by anyone intrigued by Egyptian history.  These
viewers will no doubt be fascinated by the film's realistic
re-enactments of that period perfectly captured in 3D.",1453075200,,3416,4.954385964912281

3924090,3,B002FUIIZW,"This IMAX film reminded me of a children's film. It was very simple and easy to follow - perhaps too simple. The depth and complexity of Ancient Egyptian culture and their mummies seems to have been swept away in this one. It was a blend of reenactments, and some storytelling, without the straightforward scientific/historical documentary approach that I prefer. Still, Ancient Egypt is fascinating. The part that upset me the most was learning how the Abd el Rasoul family broke into tombs and sold off antiques - such precious knowledge and historical culture lost! I am so glad the Egyptian Antiquities Service was able to uncover the location of the pharaohs' tombs and preserve an important part of Egypt's heritage.",1351209600,,722,5.025
3924091,5,B002FUIIZW,"I don't have 3-D yet so I had to settle for Blu-ray.

As I have implied this is a quickie overview of Egypt. It's claimed the same as the eye-popping graphics. And they do a good job of showing Egypt from different views at different times of day under different lighting. While you're enjoying the way that it looks this condensed version of history actually borrows from much longer programs and introduces us to major people that are still involved in Egyptology in the history of people that were involved in Egyptology. The only thing that it lacks is a reading reference.

The disc does have however the standard DVD extras such as ""Meet the Mummies"" and a 22 minute ""making of"" Featurette.  There was a quiz but I did not take it.

Even if you already know the contents of the disk and even if you seem the longer programs this disc is still worth having for quick synopsis is worth re-watching periodically. I kept trying to figure out where the music came from it sounded like things from 10 Commandments Lawrence of Arabia and other various pictures. It turns out that it was originally written for this presentation.",1341532800,,1127,4.62
3924092,5,B002FUIIZW,"First and foremost, I love documentaries on anciet Egypt, especially mummies. So this review may come off as a tad bit biased to some, however, I will try to keep this review as unbiased as possible.

As far as content, this documentary has a few different story lines. The first being somewhat of an ancient Egypt history lesson, focusing on Ramses the Great, his father, and his son. The next focuses on how the mummies were actually made, and how to extract DNA from ancient mummies and comparing them to the DNA of modern mummies. The last story line talks about the 'code breakers' and how they were able to bring ancient Egypt back to life and discover the final resting places of mummies like Ramses.

Personally, I thought the 3D features were fine. There aren't too many pop out images, I think there are maybe seven total, and all of them were pretty cool. The majority of the film is shown with depth, which is really quite brilliant, sharp, and beautiful.

Overall, if you enjoy mummies and ancient Egypt you will enjoy this film. For the price, its a steal.",1341446400,,1070,4.591623036649215
3924093,5,B002FUIIZW,I didn't expect anything but a film about mummies and that's is what I got. This isn't a action movie and the 3d is just around for depth mainly. Too many people watch these for things to pop out at them. That's not reality with most of these imax shows. They are simply shows about a topic shot in 3d. Christopher Lee sounds very impressive as the narrator too. THe 3d effects are mainly in tombs so it's not going to be that spectacular. However the shots are lovely and you do learn alot in this documentary.  The outside shots are incredible though. Recent events have made traveling to egypt more dangerous and now mobs are raping young english women in the street there for not wearing burkas. So at least you are safe watching this one on tv.,1340668800,,749,4.388489208633094

But both the 3D and 2D seem to be the same you can watch the 3D without glasses. I thought it was a manufacturing defect and emailed the company through the web site, no response. The photography is great and the program is quite good with Christopher Lee's low voice sounding great in such a mysterious subject.

3924104,2,B002FUIIZW,"Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs was the first 3D feature I bought to test out my new Acer 3D monitor, and let me tell ya...The 3D was TERRIBLE.  I was expecting some nice pop-out effects, but in the forty-or-so minutes of this documentary, there was only one:  a lizard that randomly comes out at you during one segment.

I'm sorry, but when I see 3D, I expect to see some really nice, cool-looking effects.  I know that depth is a key element to 3D, but this video had too much inward depth and not enough OUTWARD depth.  It works both ways!

From now on, my official 3D Blu-ray review ratings will consist of 1 star maximum for content and 4 starts for 3D quality (1 being very poor, 2: fair, 3: good, 4: excellent).  Mummies gets the star for content, but a very poor rating for 3D.  Hence. TWO STARS overall.",1317686400,,813,4.337748344370861
3924105,1,B002FUIIZW,"I don't know whether I just received a bad disc (since no one else has described the problem I have experienced), but I have serious difficulties playing it. The sound keeps stopping and starting, skipping and repeating, while the video itself keeps moving on (yes, in 3D). The feature documentary is only 39 minutes long but I was so frustrated by the poor performance I gave up watching after about 15-20 minutes.

I suspect I am missing nothing, other than the money I wasted on this product, because the documentary is quite boring. It is supposed to be about mummies and the secrets of the pharaohs, but it spends more time showing silly pagent-style re-enactments of what the ancient Egyptians allegedly behaved like. Then it starts talking about DNA and malaria.

I do not know what the rest of the disc shows because all the skipping of the sound just got to me and I could not watch the rest.

As for the 3D everyone else seems to be talking about: Do not buy this disc for 3D. It is overdone, shot with too large an interaxial distance, which makes everything look like miniature models instead of the real thing. It may have worked on the huge IMAX screen, it definitely does not work on a 3D TV or computer monitor.

Sorry, folks, I normally only write reviews of products I really like. In this case, however, I had to make an exception to warn you. Not only is the Blu-ray disc deficient, the 39-minute content comes to about 50 cents a minute (or in my case a dollar a minute since I had to give up in the middle), way too much for something that should have never been ported from the large IMAX screen to a small TV or monitor in your living room.

My cable service provides a few free movies and this one just happened to be one of them. I believe now you can buy it here for about $10, judging on that price I think the movie rates about average, it's a short documentary with good special effects and 3D video. It was very enjoyable for a tittle that I've never seen before, I am not a fan of this subject, but I still found myself getting involved and dragged along with. There is one good special 3D effect that impressed me I think its at about minute :5:00 it's a reptilian that moves out of the screen creating a great effect.

If I did not have comcast I think I would of probably paid for movie ($10) and not had regretted it, probably up to $15 is a good value.

At this point the amount of 3D movies available is limited, specially the good ones.

3924115,4,B002FUIIZW,"I'm a fan of Egyptian history and when I saw that there was a documentary in 3D I had to give it a try. I'm glad I did, the 3D is pretty good, there were times where the hieroglyphics looked like they were floating off the walls of the tombs. Most of the movie was like that but there were some areas where it looked a bit odd with perspective. Over all there was a good amount of things I learned from this movie and having it in 3D made it more interesting. My only complaint is that it was a bit short, should have been another15-20 minutes more.

If you like Egyptian history and want to see some good 3D you should like this disc.",1306972800,2,635,4.0396825396825395
3924116,5,B002FUIIZW,"This is a fabulous quality DVD, I love the fact that it plays on Australian Region B 3d DVD player. The picture quality & 3D effects on this 3d blu ray disc are amazing.  I love it I could watch it over and over again well done IMAX.  Amazon's service and packaging was amazing, safe & reliable, shipped to OZ.  Great work and service Amazon. I would however recommend for Amazon to please specify which region  all their listed blu ray DVDs will play on for example Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs [Blu-ray 3D][ABC Regions}
Please note that an A B C symbol on the back of the blu ray DVD indicates what region it will play in; in this case all three letters ie ABC blu ray means Mummies will play on all region players.
For your reference here are the dvd regions
Regions for Blu-ray standard
  A: East Asia (except Mainland China and Mongolia), Southeast Asia, the Americas and their dependencies.
  B: Africa, Southwest Asia, Europe (except Russia), Oceania and their dependencies.
  C: Central Asia, East Asia (Mainland China and Mongolia only), South Asia, central Eurasia and their dependencies.
For the record I know that Amazon should sends you a trigger indicating the region at checkout time, in this instance it did not work for my purchases consequently leaving me with DVD's that are not viewable in Australia, thus needing to be returned.............If the region advertised on listed is alongside the description and or name of the DVD then future customers will know what they purchasing.  Thanks Amazon hope you take on board my constructive feedback and make the change :-) as you guys providing an amazing service Love from Oz",1306713600,,1646,4.780918727915195
3924117,5,B002FUIIZW,"When I got all my new 3D stuff I saw this film and I knew I had to have it.
I'm glad I bought it.
I just love anything that has to do with ancient Egypt or mummies.
The 3D is for the most part done extremely well without being overpowering.
The story is interesting and held my attention.
Direction, cinematography, music are all top notch.
And Christoper Lee as the narrator is just icing in the cake.
Does anyone have a more perfect voice?
All in all a fun, educational romp though ancient Egypt.
Not too deep or overwhelming a perfect introduction to the kids and adults alike who are interested in the subject.
Beautiful and done well enough for those of us who are already familiar with Egypt to warrant a purchase.
Highly recommended.",1303516800,10,740,4.448529411764706
3924118,3,B002FUIIZW,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

Not counting floating text, there are 7 out of screen effects. The first at about 5:30 minutes, a graphic that floats out an impressive 50% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. At about 10:00 the top view of a priest said to be chanting a spell is OOS from the waist up for 15 seconds at 10%. Four times, windows float at about 20% while continuing to tell the story inside them, lasting 30 to 60 seconds each. The remaining OOS is of mummy toes; they extend 15% for 6 seconds.

No real complaints about the in screen 3D. Most of the footage is clear and excess parallax only showed itself a few times.

***  Nice views of Egyptian sites, tombs and mummies ***
***  My 3D rating is lowered due to lack of more 3D wow effects ***

MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

3924120,4,B002FUIIZW,"Mummies have long been the subject of eerie fascination. These leathery, preserved bodies have fueled the imagination of novelists, filmmakers, and research scientists alike. Originally filmed in large format for IMAX theaters, Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs, which is one part recreational docudrama and another part high-tech science, takes a new approach to a general, introductory level overview of Egyptian spiritual beliefs and mummification practices.

Created with the young or general interest viewer in mind, this 39-minute documentary covers territory familiar to most with a passing acquaintance with Egypt. The general techniques and reasons for mummification are touched upon without becoming overly technical. But the unique areas are found in the film delving into modern research revolving around the creation of `fresh' mummies and the search for DNA in both these and ancient specimens in a search for genetically encoded malarial clues.

With three young children, we're devotees of the docudrama approach wherein historical events are reenacted with narration describing the historical detail. With an approximately 50/50 split between scenes of reenactment and more typical technical documentary scenes, the most memorable for our family is the discovery of the tomb of Rameses III and 40 other royal mummies in the 1880s. The details are unforgettable when given life by the actors.

Be aware that scenes of actual, unwrapped mummies are included frequently throughout the documentary. This can prove to be either the most appealing or horrific aspect of this title depending upon the sensitivity levels of your children (or yourself!). I wasn't sure how our children would react, but the lack of scary music or reference to manufactured ""curse of the mummy"" speculation helped them take everything in stride. The mummies are presented rather matter-of-factly with an appreciation for the discovery of potential knowledge hidden within their genetic structure and a general sense of wonder for the culture that produced them.

In addition to the somewhat brief feature, an additional 22-minute ""making of"" segment is included, with a strong emphasis on the challenges of filming for a large format. Educational add-ons such as an interactive multiple choice quiz, fast facts, and a ""Meet the Mummies"" section where educational details are provided for a number of famous mummies in an on-screen text format, add to the film's educational appeal for budding Egyptologists. The documentary includes standard scene navigation from an external menu and from within the film, and offers three language tracks - English, French and Spanish - all recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1.

Most of my memories from childhood studies of Egypt revolve around factual tidbits about mummies. I believe that they are nearly universally fascinating, and therefore make a great entry point into learning more about Egyptian history. Mummies: Secrets of the Pharoahs will make an appealing addition to any elementary or junior high course of Egyptian study.",1263427200,16,3056,5.507462686567164
