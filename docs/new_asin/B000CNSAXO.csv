8099852,5,B000CNSAXO,"YA Entertainment put out classic Korean dramas before they went out of business a few years ago because of Chinese bootleggers cutting into their business with inferior cheap disc sets. This drama was a blockbuster with over half the nation watching, businesses shutting down early so they could race home and watch, it made all the actors stars - most are still working in dramas today, so it's fun to see them in 1995 when they were all so young. My favorite character was the chivalrous body guard. If only more men were like him in real life - good as gold, faithful, honorable, devoted, even when the woman they love fancies someone else. The drama showcases much of more recent Korean history between the 1960's through the 1980's, depicting the societal and financial changes the nation was undergoing, the changes in politics and the business world and family life as well. I think all Korean drama fans should watch Sandglass. It's an Essential.",1523145600,,954,4.823170731707317
8099853,5,B000CNSAXO,"Reviewing a dvd, I like to distinguish between the contents (the quality of the show itself) and the implementation in the particular disk set (is the picture sharp; are there special features; can you get the disks out of the bleeping packaging, are the subtitles accurate & complete, etc, etc).

One a scale of 1 to 5, I't rate the show a 6 and the disk set about a 2.5.

First, the good news.  The show lives up to its reputation.  What reputation, you ask?  Snippets from the Wikipedia article on it say it better than I can:

""one of the highest-rated Korean dramas in history, and is also considered one of the most significant""

""It even influenced the prosecution of ex-President Chun Doo-hwan responsible for the massacre (he was finally jailed, decades after the incident).""

""Traffic was visibly lighter and pubs reported slow business as government officials, students and office workers alike headed home early to watch Sandglass every Monday through Thursday evenings.""

""A depiction of the tragic relationship among three friends affected by the political and civilian oppression of 1970s and 1980s Korea, the series mixed politics, melodrama, action, and great acting. It recorded a peak rating of 64.5%, the third highest of all time, and launched its leading trio of Choi Min-soo, Go Hyun-jung, and Park Sang-won into stardom. Its reenactment of the Gwangju Massacre (interspersed with archival video footage) remains one of the most realistic, devastatingly powerful, and unforgettable moments in Korean TV history.""  I don't disagree with any of that, but I especially endorse the bit about power of the Gwangju scenes.  And the bit about the good acting -- fwiw, Go Hyun-jung showed in ""Queen's Classroom"" that she can act more with just her eyes than most stars can act, period.

From other corners of the internet:

""A masterpiece of chaotic modern history.""

""Possibly the ultimate K-drama, Sandglass became a cultural phenomenon in 1995. Shops and businesses closed early so workers could get home in time to watch it.""  (TV.com).

""So yes, the streets were deserted, just about everybody went home to watch the show, with even bars having to buy TVs and post stickers with 'We're screening Sandglass' on their entrance, in the hope their business wouldn't go belly up.""  (review on yesasia.com)

""Sandglass is to be considered as the mother of every modern Korea drama that reflects any historical history of Korea."" (weebly.com)

If you care enough to read reviews like this you may have already read up on Sandglass, the Gwanju massacre and Chun Doo-hwan.  If you haven't, you should.  Then for dessert, read up on the director and cast members and see how many more dramas you could make based on their lives.

Despite the impact of the Gwangju scenes and the focus on them many internet reviews, they are only a small part of the show, on  just disk 3 of the 8.  But the rest of the show keeps touching on how things worked (and still work???) in Korea.  Even people who don't care about corruption and abuse of power in Korea should watch Sandglass in case they notice any similarities to any other countries or periods.  I suspect that some of the popularity of kdramas in other countries is because it is safe & legal to watch Koreans complain about things in Korea that people can't safely complain about directly in their own countries.  There's no place like coughhomecough South Korea.

You could almost use this show a text for a poly-sci class on the developing world -- and yes, I took such a class long ago.  And it is sad/scary that this show is about one of the success stories of the developing world.

Warning: no comic relief here.  It's the kind of kick-in-the-guts show you will be glad you watched and may want to watch again and force all your friends to watch, but  you won't want to watch only shows like this every week.

Compared to other kdramas, more things actually happen in this show.  Most kdramas only have one big issue and fill their allotted episode count by making up lots of silly obstacle-of-the-week crises to stall the big issue until the last couple episodes.  But if you combine a love story with a really big issue like ""how the country works"", and do it right, you can cover some ground instead of running in place.

This is the oldest kdrama I've seen, and it has a lot of the better elements that keep popping in current shows, but without some of the lame stuff like the goofy pal for comic relief.  It's for adults of (almost) all ages, unlike countless other shows (both Korean and American) that are for dim-bulb children age 5 to 105.  It's almost like the original one true pattern of which all other kdramas are just inferior reflections.  (pardon the Zelazny reference).

Now the bad news.

No special features.  You get sound in Korean (only) and subtitles in English (only).

Picture quality is so-so, not nearly as good as my DVDs of newer kdramas.  Guess you can't expect much from a 1995 show put onto DVD at about a decade later.  Who knows where the pixels lived for for all those years?  It's not native widescreen (naturally, for a 1995 show), and my TV & BD player insisted on showing it stretched horizontally, ""fatface"" and I couldn't find a combination of settings on them to fix that.  Argh  :(  But VLC on my computer showed it in the aspect ratio that nature intended  :)  Fatface always drives me crazy, but it's especially vile when the female lead is a former Miss Korea runner-up.
""Does this aspect ratio make me look fat?""
""Yes"".

You can also see it on legal free ad-supported sites - coughDramaFevercough.  Usually when I buy a kdrama DVD set it's because I'm willing to pay extra for better picture quality than I get with free streaming on my (slow) internet connection, but in this case the streamed version seems about as good.  So while I recommend the show, it's hard to recommend spending much money on this DVD.  Something odd about Dramafever though; I can start Sandglass ok by browsing their long list of shows, and it takes me to the next episode ok when I get to the one of the one before, but if I try to find it using their search function, or try to jump ahead to a later episode, it won't let me in without logging in to an account, which I don't have.  To re-watch a later episode, I have to start ep 1, jump to almost the end of it, let it start ep 2, jump to almost the end of 2, etc, etc.  So paying for the disks might save a lot of aggravation if you don't want to sign up for an account.

The subtitles are ok by current kdrama standards.

Packaging is ok.  The big box contains two standard-size boxes, each with 4 disks and a styrofoam slab to stop them from flopping around if they come off the holders.  Disks were firmly held in place but not especially hard to remove.  At least I was willing to put the disks back in the box when I was done instead of reaching for my pile of standalone holders.

This review is for the YA Entertainment, dvd region 1 version of Sandglass I purchased on Amazon in Feb, 2015.  As I write this (just 5 days later), they show only 1 copy left and the price has gone up.",1423958400,,7136,4.600158353127474

Please advise!!!  Thank you.

8099855,5,B000CNSAXO,"This is one of the most outstanding pieces of television drama I've seen in years, and I've seen many fine dramas from China, Japan, and Korea. In a plot reminiscent of ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", it deals with the lives of two young men who've been friends since their school days. One is an excellent student, mild of manner; one is a poor student, but excels with his fists.

After his family is dispossessed of their home by a corrupt landlord, the good student attends college, gets his law degree, and ultimately becomes a public prosecutor. The fighter is denied advancement in his education because his father was a Communist sympathizer, and is recruited as a thug by Korean organized crime, and ultimately rises to a top position in the mob. Between them is the girl, the daughter of a wealthy and powerful casino owner in the top echelons of the Korean gambling syndicate. All this is set in the 1970's and early 80's, during a period of major political upheavel. (I lived in Korea during the decade of the 1970's, and remember that era quite well.)

This is no sappy romance, but an extremely well written political drama that will engage the viewer from the very start, to the final shattering climax. Events such as the Kwangju uprising and the Korean ""re-education"" camps for malcontents, criminals and troublemakers are vividly and powerfully portrayed. The characters are vivid and the storyline is absorbing. For those worried about the quality of the subtitles, they are excellent.

A number of current Korean drama are quite entertaining, but this is a serious piece of drama which will burn itself into the memory of viewers long after the fluff (and that includes all the current American television fluff) is long forgotten. Highly, highly recommended.",1226534400,13,1774,4.906666666666666
8099856,5,B000CNSAXO,"This is not like the newer scannable entertainment products from South Korea.  This is a production that everyone involved must be very proud of.  I haven't forgotten this series and therefore, I thought of the lead actress when it was announced that Hollywood wanted to cast Gong Li as Queen Min to the understandable discomfort of Koreans.

Is this frugal?  no but I bought a set of VHS tapes at this high price many years ago but had those many years with this story living inside of me and that was very important and I bought nothing else for a long time - even now, so many popular dramas' meagerness show up in the light of this series

Would I have purchased this used at a cheaper price off of craigslist? yes
Did I shop around for the best total price including the manufacturer's website?  no, it was a rare thing when I bought it years ago and I was lucky that something so unsilly was my introduction to the Go Li People (The Tall and Beautiful - is their name to the Chinese).

All the undeserved pain depicted here is only a fraction of what was suffered during the Japanese occupation.",1164153600,7,1101,4.420792079207921
