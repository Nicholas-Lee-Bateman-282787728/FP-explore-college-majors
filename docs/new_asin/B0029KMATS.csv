8357850,5,B0029KMATS,Beautiful video.  I work in a doctor office and this is what we have playing in the waiting room.  Our patients love the scenery and often comment on their travels to the different sites on this video.,1484524800,,201,4.405405405405405

8357852,2,B0029KMATS,"This is has no voice over or labels. So, it's just an aerial view of the US. The easily recognizable sites are ok but sometime there are mountains, forests or rivers that are not readily identifiable. Unless you just want something on your tv screen, don't bother. I give it 2 stars for the beauty of the landscape.
With direction and verbal identification, it could have easily been 4-5 stars.",1444348800,,394,4.642857142857143
