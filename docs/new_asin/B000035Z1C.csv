1259160,5,B000035Z1C,"Whether the second series of Connections is better or worse that the original is a matter of some arguement, but that they are both great is not.  Why?  Because for once someone was able to communicate history in an exciting and faciating form, showing that every person, event, or invention relates in some way to every other.  Imagine a ""six degrees of separation"" through history, mix in a strong sense of how to tell the _story_ of history, add in a wicked sense of humor and wit, and you might have some idea of the brilliance of this show.
Until amazon gets it listed, you can also buy the first series directly from Abrose Video (ambrosevideo.com), but they are all worth owning.",1085270400,57,686,4.60655737704918
1259161,5,B000035Z1C,"I can only assume this is James Burke's great series?? Shouldn't Amazon review what this product is exactly?? If its Burke's fine series then its a 5.. I'd love to buy this if someone told me exactly what was included, Wake up Amazon!!!",1081296000,32,236,4.511627906976744
1259162,4,B000035Z1C,"Aha!  The second of the Connections series is available.  So is the third, Connections 3...

The entire Connections series is great for the young, inspiring them to intelligent inquiry into science, history and history of technology.  Burke, ridiculed by many historians for his somewhat loose connections (historians are a crabby, selfish bunch) none-the-less explains interesting major inventions through a series of... well, connections in history, science and society.  He makes much more sense than the historians who don't like him and is therefore correct in all his major points.  Oh, by the way, I have a degree in history.

So, buy this if you've got a smart kid and want to stimulate him or her to the greater pursuits of the mind.",1068163200,6,742,5.032786885245901
1259163,4,B000035Z1C,"Connections 2 is good but not excellent. It pales in comparison to the first series. How I wish the original BBC productions of ""Connections"" and ""The Day the Universe Changed"", another great program by the same author which aired on TV a few years ago, were available for purchase.
Connections 2 lacks the originality and entertainment value of Connections 1 which used actors to show how events occured. The original Connections entertained while it taught at the same time showing the viewer how great moments in history lead to the accidental discovery of many useful things which in turn led to other inventions. Somehow that joy of discovery that I got from the original is missing in Connections 2.",1027123200,28,705,4.932773109243698
1259164,3,B000035Z1C,"Of all the science and history programs I ever watched, Connections has to be the best program ever. So, when TLC announced a second series, I was excited. This series, however, falls far short of the original.
First, each episode is a half an hour instead of an hour. This rushes the stories a bit.
Second, there was a flow to the whole first series. It was one thread. This was very choppy, and the ""connections"" felt a lot more forced.
I never got a sense of flow from this edition of the series. I get the feeling James Burke was approached 10 years after the first series, and ""couldn't refuse the money"". The series, as a whole, didn't seem as well thought out as the first where EVERYTHING seemed to connect. This felt much more scattered.
Mind you, this is still a good series for those interested in science and history. It just isn't ""your father's connections"". I don't want to be a discouragement. I just want to be clear that if you saw the first series, the second is not the same.",1011916800,28,995,4.413043478260869
1259175,5,B000035Z1C,My husband has wanted this series for a long time and I was quite happy to find it for him.  It is a great series.,1383436800,,114,3.56
1259176,5,B000035Z1C,I have seen this series before & found it so interesting & fun that I bought this set as a gift for a friend. I feel one can watch it over & over again & it is fun to share.,1379030400,,173,3.35
1259177,5,B000035Z1C,What a great series. It would be interesting if universities would teach the same way Burke does in their content classes. A young social studies teacher would enter the profession 'on fire' with Burke's methodology in his/her back pocket.,1362700800,,239,5.153846153846154
1259178,5,B000035Z1C,"I remember watching these on PBS back in the 80s, and love watching them again!  So glad they're available on DVD!",1353110400,,114,4.428571428571429
1259179,5,B000035Z1C,This is by far the best series ever on TV. Came on time...was as expected. Enjoyed it thoroughly and will continue to do so.,1340236800,,124,4.208333333333333
1259180,5,B000035Z1C,Used to watch this show when I was younger and is was great.  Purchasing and watching the digital video disks was great. The menu setup on the disks was great.,1339545600,2,159,4.3
1259181,5,B000035Z1C,"This is an excellent documentary series, a must watch for anyone interested in the history of innovation and technology.  The series illustrates how inventions in the distant past connect to the technologies we use today.",1313884800,,221,5.314285714285714
1259182,2,B000035Z1C,"I really enjoyed James Burke's first series, ""The Day the Universe Change"". Then he did Connections I, II and III. Connections I was decent. However, Connections II and III were less than interesting. Because each episode was so boring, I often quit watching them before getting to the end. Definitely not worth the price of $80. In fact, knowing what I now know, even $15 is too much for II and III.",1305331200,2,400,4.569444444444445
1259183,5,B000035Z1C,"If you didn't ""get"" history in school - THIS is the history for you.
Absolutely amazing.
Each episode takes a look at some part of the history of technology from a lateral, rather than verticcal perspective.
He does it ins such a relaxex and entertaining way that even kids get ""hooked"" on the story.",1287273600,2,300,4.574074074074074
1259184,2,B000035Z1C,"The production value and overall quality of this version of Connections is inferior to the first series in my opinion.  It also repeats information already covered in the first but in a less interesting way.  There is also more commentary being interjected that the first series was better off without, although there was some in the last show of that series too.",1285372800,2,363,4.838709677419355
1259195,5,B000035Z1C,I had watched these programs over the years and was hoping for the day when they would be available on DVD as my old VHS tapes were in sorry shape. The price was fantastic and they arrived sooner than expected. I would HIGHLY recommend these DVDs to any fan of Mr. Burke's and encourage you to also read his books. The DVDs and the books will surely stand the test of time as a treasured addition to your video and library collection.,1269043200,,434,4.304878048780488
1259196,3,B000035Z1C,"As a series Connections 2 is Amazing, and if I were only reviewing the program I would give it five stars.  However after I bought this DVD I noticed some of the scenes were missing, and after a little research I found out that the source used in the making of this DVD set was the syndicated version of the program.  I also own this program on VHS which had the original version so that's how I was able to notice the difference.  It might seem like a nit pick, but the bits that are missing I thought added to the personality of the program.  I would still recommend this DVD set as it is still really good, but I'm hoping for a ""special edition"" or something to be released with the whole program intact.",1252281600,42,707,4.214814814814815
1259197,5,B000035Z1C,I was hooked as soon as I saw one episode years ago.  Had to have the whole collection,1223769600,,86,3.7777777777777777
1259198,5,B000035Z1C,"This is an excellent series, as are all of James Burke's series. But .... WHERE IS ""THE REAL THING""? I had the misfortune of thinking this was some kind of show about Coca Cola when I first noticed it in the TV listings in the paper back in the '70's. I finally checked it out when it only had about 3 episodes left and here was this guy talking about time perception on a set that looked like a Salvador Dali painting.
  The next episode was about language perception and had some professional theater people. One would read a script as fast as he possibly could and a second would try to repeat it only by listening. The results were amazing.

1259199,5,B000035Z1C,"Connections 2 is not a repeat of the original, although it does cover some of the same ground, taking some of the same items and connecting them in new ways to new final outcomes. Using some of the same points does mean that some information is repeated between the two seasons, but if you never saw the first season, you'd be just as fascinated. James Burke has a way of making boring science and history very interesting. He begins season one by placing an object on the table and saying, ""You don't know what this is, but you want to,"" and instantly, you do. This way of drawing you in continues through the series. There aren't as many episodes as in season one and season three has even less. This is the only thing bad I say about this series, it's not long enough to tell all the fascinating stories that James has to tell.",1200096000,2,830,4.361290322580645
1259200,1,B000035Z1C,"In the Connections Series, James tries to trace a series of past events that he claims are ultimately responsible for today's technological advances and conditions. I was referred to this series from a review about Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything.""  (I highly recommend Bill Bryson's book).

Made in the late 1970's, this series has turned out to be very disappointing for me. The material is presented in a dense and non-interesting way... It's like watching a series with old Star Trek acting but without the old Star Trek charms and messages...

Even more important, trying to trace the causation of anything requires a true expert. Anyone can trace and path a path in a web of causations and claim a revelation (hence the existence of so many conspiracy theories!). A true guide can trace the important and less revealed paths and take you on a insightful and revealing journey. Unfortunately, James is no such a guide.",1197590400,3,943,4.918238993710692
1259201,5,B000035Z1C,"First off, I like to say the first time saw the Connections series I was hooked. When Connections 2 & 3 came out I had to watch them as well as the series The Day the Universe Changed. James Burke really knows how to make history interesting. He made connections you wouldn't see or even think about. Wish he made more of this kind of stuff can't get enough if it.

OK, now a word of warning. These great series are now public domain; people are starting to put together copies of their own disks and selling them. These copies may not be of good quality and may even be duplicates of the disks made by Ambruse Video. If you see a new seller or just listed with a price less than $80 it is probably one of these copies and I don't recommend buying them.",1190332800,9,753,4.157534246575342
1259202,5,B000035Z1C,"This series is quite good, though the connections between the ideas and inventions didn't seem to be developed in as much depth and seemed more tenuous than in the previous two series.  This may be a function of the format--22 short episodes instead of fewer, longer shows.  That said, the shows are still fascinating to watch.",1181433600,3,327,4.821428571428571
1259203,5,B000035Z1C,"Firstly, this is NOT Connections Vol. 2, it is CONNECTIONS 2 as in Connections Series 2. By saying it is ""Vol. 2"", people are likely to think it's merely one disc or volume in a series.

There were three series by James Burke in this vein. Connections (10 50 min. episodes), Connections 2 (20 30 min. episodes), and Connections 3 (10 45 min. episodes). Also, there was ""The Day the Universe Changed"" a series of 10 50 min. episodes.

This is actually a five-disc box set with the entire Connections 2 series. The episodes are as follows:

Having cleared that up, I wish to say that this is a great series and DVD set. Very eye-opening and educational.

It would make a great educational gift for children or a fun gift for adults. Anyone with an inquiring mind will be fascinated by James Burke's wit and intelligence, not to mention his charismatic delivery.",1135987200,179,3844,4.831029185867895
