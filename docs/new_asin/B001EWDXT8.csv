3557512,5,B001EWDXT8,"Season six of One Tree Hill is my favorite seasons. Leyton (Peyton and Lucas) lovers will be thrilled. Lucas finally makes up his mind and chooses Peyton. The story lines are crazy but fun such a crazy nanny Carrie. Peyton and Lucas finally have some happiness in their life and viewers are teased with wedding talk, Lucas's book gets a movie offer, and Peyton and Lucas are thrilled with news of pregnancy. However, the happiness doesn't last. Lucas's movie deal falls through and Peyton has a pregnancy complications. Peyton's ex-boyfriend is in town to produce Lucas's movie. Brooke is attacked in her store which leads her into a dark place. Haley also ends up convincing Brooke to take in a foster child named Sam. Nathan, Lucas, and Skills coach the new Tree Hill Ravens in which Nathan becomes a mentor to Quention who give them problems on the basketball team and gives Haley problems in the classroom. Mouth and Millie's relationship takes a turn. Dan's future looks grim when a dog eats his donor heart. My favorite episode of this season is when Lucas and Peyton babysit Andre and Jamie, but there are still 3 more episodes left.

Season 6 has many laughs and many tears. There are some new characters outside of the core 5 that I don't really care as much for and some parts a little cheesy, but still a really good season in my opinion.",1240531200,27,1349,4.644351464435147
3557513,2,B001EWDXT8,"After the 4th season I had ben ready to give up on One Tree Hill.  The same old storylines, the never ending Lucas/Brooke/Peyton storyline, and the shows habit to put its main characters in life threating positions over and over to the point that you almost wish they would die, just so there would be some actual drama.  The only time this worked was with Keith (they actually killed him) and it turned out to be the best storyline in the shows history.  So when season 5 began I reluctantly watched the 1st episode and was suprised that I liked it.  And before I knew it, I was looking forward to the new episodes every week.  The show had been revitalized, with new characters, new ways of life, and adult problems to go with it.  It was like a brand new show.  When season 6 came out it was like to season 5 never happened.  The tired ideas and storylines from before were trotted back out, (Dan and Payton both having life threating health issues) and almost eveything good about season 5 was thrown out.  I am so tired of this show.  I hope that if the show if renewed (which is doubtful) they go back to what was working and throw the recycled old crap out.",1239235200,4,1164,4.32258064516129

3557615,5,B001EWDXT8,"One Tree Hill Season 6 one of my favorite season also the last season for 2 of my favorite characters Lucas and Peyton. But besides that this season was absolutly AMAZING.I definatly think that this season is much better than the next which is One Tree Hill: The Complete Seventh Season. Also I bought mine from Electroica Direct and I noticed that the packaging is kinda different it's not like the tiny little flip case it's these huge white flip cases the dvd's are in,but it's no big deal and the last disc was kinda scatched up but it played fine so again no big deal as long as I can all the DVD's and they play fine I'm OK.But the outside and everythng came just fine nice straight edges no bents,no anything so thanks Electrocia Direct for allowing it to arrive within 2 days just like they said.:)

Some of my Favorite Episodes are:
-6x02 ""One Millionth Billonth of a Millisecond on a Sunday Morning""
-6x05 ""You Dug your own Grave,Now Lie in it""(one of my favorite episodes of the season.)
-6x11 ""We Three(My Echo,My Shadow and Me)""(one of my favorite episodes of the season.)
-6x13 ""Things a Mama Don't Do""
-6x16 ""Screenwriter's Blues""
-6x24 ""Remember Me as a Time of Day""(my favorite episode of the season,also the last episode for Lucas and Peyton :(,..)
Don't get me wrong all the episodes are great but these really stand out.

My Favorite Seasons(1-the best 7-not that great):
1. Season 4
2. Season 5
3. Season 6
4. Season 7
5. Season 3
6. Season 2
7. Season 1-only because not that much awesome drama as the characters are still trying to develop and had some dull episodes...but hey what can you expect from a starter season.

Final Thoughts:
I would give One Tree Hill Season 6 on a scale 1-10 a 9. And as you can see my 5 top favorite seasons of One Tree Hill,Season 6 falls under ""3"".If you are a fan of ONE Tree Hill GET THIS.And if you never watched OTH then you NEED TO WATCH THIS but don't start from here start from season 1,so you can gather the fill story and see how they all became so close. I got this season on Amazon when it was on sale for $19.05,but for an awesome season like this I would spend any price on it. So thanks Amazon and thanks for reading I hope this review helped. :)",1303776000,,2216,4.3607748184019375

3557638,5,B001EWDXT8,"Season 6 was definitely one of my favorite seasons of the show. The first four were entertaining, but the endless love triangles, catfights, and puppy love grew old after about two seasons. It's nice to have the characters we love all grown up and having, well, ""grown-up"" problems.

A definite plus for this season was finally having Lucas and Peyton (our epic-but-never-meant-to-be-couple) as an actual couple. I'm only sad to know that this is the last time we will be seeing those two on the show, as Chad Michael Murray and Hilarie Burton are both not returning next season.
There were several other really good, engaging plot lines this season - including Brooke dealing with her attack, the introduction of her foster daughter Sam, Quentin's death, and some really great moments for Brooke and Peyton's friendship (which I think has always been and always will be the heart of the show).

Yes, it's a soap, but it's a good soap! OTH fans will drool over season 6.

*Just a side note: the packaging was so much more compact and sleek than the other seasons! It seems like not a big deal, but it was kind of nice, I thought...",1259280000,,1131,4.673366834170854

3557640,4,B001EWDXT8,"I've been a Tree Hill fan since the show first came out.  I know that many liken this to 90120.  And, while there may be some similarities stylistic wise the attitude and characters sever that tie quickly.  ""One Tree Hill"" had a very average 5th season as the characters were making the transition from school to adulthood.  Season six brought back the edginess that was missing in season 5.  It's sad that the two main characters, Lucas Scott and Peyton Sawyer are now gone.  To me, they along with Brooke Davis, made the show what it was.  Will that magic be gone now?  Only time will tell.  But I can say this, the first 6 seasons are some of the best as far as tv drama is concerned.  So, if you have not picked up season 6 yet you need to do so as it rounds out the series....at least up to the end of the Luke era!!",1255996800,,821,4.139240506329114

It has events that could really happen and deals with issues that teens - adults really go thru.  Of course if you have never watched this show before, do not get this one first.  Start in order from the beginning and work your way thru to this one.  All the original actors are not still in it, but these sets do work as a true series.  I don't think that this series dissapoints. May not be the best one but certainly is still an awesome show.

3557656,1,B001EWDXT8,"Please don't even bother watching the first 3 season's of this series because watching the 6th season is like watching a totally deferent show. Nothing is cohesive and if your an actual fan of the core 5 characters don't even bother because theirs hardly any interaction between them. I remember watching the pilot of this show and thinking it had some potential to be great especially with the whole relationship with Dan, Lucas, and Nathan. Six episodes into season 1 I was hooked, everything was so realistic fun and new. I actually found characters that I loved and rooted for and character developement was at all time high. Two seasons later I would never have thought I would stop watching, all the character developement that was built during season 2 & 3 was shot to hell with season 4. Characters & storylines turned OOC and god awful. I thought season 4 was the worse but I still had hope for the new seasons. HAHAH big mistake, season 6 has taken the cake and I have to say I blame the writing. I mean come on how many times do I have to watch Peyton near death, I seriously could care less how a totally unrealistic character can be thrown into life and death situations just to see her cry 85% of the season. And Dan, jesus can the guy die already, he has been poisened, hit by a car, tortured by a pschotic nanny (lmfao yes that actually did happen), oh and let me not forget he needs a heart transplant. He was close to getting one but nah a dog seemed to come across his new heart and got hungry and ate it, WTF! It's so sad that this show has come to a dog eating a friggen heart to entertain people. No wonder the ratings fell from a 3.3 to a 2.8. I say season 6 is just a cheap imatation of a daytime SOAP, really the two most annoying emo twin couple is having trouble with their pregnancy - SHOCKER! oh c'mon will the writers try to be a bit more creative. It's already been said that Lucas & Peyton is one of the worse/awkward couples together so get over it and stop trying to get people to feel sorry for them. I don't even want to get started on the useless side characters hogging up the screen. Season 6 is just awful and worse season to date, the creator should just jump off a cliff because his show is DEAD.",1251072000,,2238,4.28066037735849

3557658,4,B001EWDXT8,"I love One Tree Hill. I watch it on my pc b/c I can't get the CW. I was worried about season 6 but to my suprise it was good.
Favorite thing:
Nanny Deb Went crazy on Nanny Carrie.
The Dog ate Dan's liver.
The Skills/ Deb affair (It was really bizzare).
Jamie Scott (I want to adopt Jackson Brundage).
Stephen Colletti came back with options (man he's gotten hot since his Laguna Beach days).
The return of Dawnn Lewis. She played Q's mom (I loved Different World growing up) seeing her again was prety cool.
Victoria's ice heart melting. I hope she's good to Brooke in the 7th season.
Julian - How hot is he. That come out of nowhere.
Finally
Brooke- oh MG. I think you're either team BROOKE or Team Peyton. I'm a Brooke girl. I love her. I think Sophia Bush is so pretty and an awesome actress. The depth she showed this season. I think this was her best season by far. Every time she was on the screen you felt her emotion.
Finally I mean FINALLY she is willing to truely love again. That last episode had me in tears. Between the baby's middle name being Brooke, her mom telling the story about money over love and Brooke going after Julian. I can't wait for season 7.

I hope Hillary and Chad stay on. At least until they can write them off in a deserving way. I hope they don't bring to many new characters in. Lastly I hope the show ends on a high note. It will truely be reveered as a dark horse drama.",1247961600,4,1409,4.180147058823529
3557659,2,B001EWDXT8,"It finally happened: Peyton and Lucas got married and had a baby girl named Sawyer! To be quite honest, the series ""One Tree Hill"" has lost its touch from WAY too many story lines of having characters fight back and forth over the same things again and again. Brooke (Sophia Bush) continues to fight with her mother Victoria (Daphne Zuniga)in who has control over the ""Clothes Over Bros"" store. She has a continuing relationship with Julian (Austin Nichols) and in the end, tries to make him jealous by having a fling with Nick Lachey from the 90's boy band ""98 Degrees"" and ""adopts"" the rebellious teen Sam Walker (Ashley Rickards). The basketball rebel Quentin Fields (Robbie Jones)life ends suddenly when he is an innocent bystander in a robbery. Nathan (James Lafferty) continues on his neverending quest to become a rising NBA star, (although I don't understand how you can after you shave points in a high school basketball game). Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) gets offered to have his book turned into a movie and finds it hard to cast the actors and actresses to play the people in his life. Peyton (Hilarie Burton)finds out that she might have cancer and the possible risk of it hurting her and her unborn child. Haley (Bethany Joy Galeotti) struggles in her career as a teacher and goes back to her roots as a singer/songwriter. Young Jamie (Jackson Brundage) deals with the sudden death of Quentin, the discovery of Skillz (Antawn Tanner) and his grandmother Deb (Barbara Alyn Woods)hooking up, and understanding the pains of growing up. From this season, I'm still wondering why Dan (Paul Johansson)was kept alive throughout this season even though crazy nanny Carrie (Torrey DeVitto) ran him over and attempted to make him suffer in anyway possible. Overall, this season was hugely disappointing in many levels. These ""Tree Hill"" characters may think they've grown-up but really, they're still trapped in the same high school drama. Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray will not be returning for Season 7 and the producers hope to mix it up with new characters and the setting will be one year into the future.",1246579200,3,2123,4.9164345403899725

Season 5 really caught my attention last year, I have to admit I never cared for this show when these characters were in high school, the storylines were over-the-top but now I enjoy the maturity. I have recently gone back and watched the previous seasons and I still don't care for all the hoopla - Season 6 is just brilliant so start here and work your way back. Sophia Bush's character Brooke Davis really got to shine this season, she took in Sam, a wise beyond her years teenage girl - fell in love with Peyton's ex Julian and made amends with her emotionally distant mother. The season finale seemed like a series finale but I heard the show will back next season. This prime time soap is a guilty pleasure and I am proud of it!",1245888000,5,830,4.396103896103896

3557662,5,B001EWDXT8,"I will admit that at the beginning of Season Six, I was concerned. I consider One Tree Hill to be the greatest show ever, but after last season I wasn't sure what was left to do with the characters. However, after watching the first episode, all doubt left my mind. The action packed storylines, the fresh romance, the perfect combination of drama and comedy. I loved the exploration into sides of Brooke not previously shown to audiences. Her trials as a foster mother are both heart wamring and entertaining, and her decline into darkness following being attacked at her store made for some good tv. Brooke really broke free as the female lead this season which is great for such an avid Brooke fan. The Nanny Carrie, and Ravens film storylines also stand out as some of the season's best.

Here are the seasons most memorable episodes. (excluding 23-24)

1. Touch Me and I'm Going to Scream Part 1
In the show's season premier, Brooke battles Victoria for her company and winds up in peril of her own. Nanny Carrie returns and acts out her vengence on Dan. Lucas and Peyton give their relationship another shot, and Mouth announces his departure from Tree Hill.

2. Things a Mama Don't Know
Brooke searches all over town for Sam after she runs away from home, and must battle a dangerous man from her past in order to save her. Peyton also has some surpising new for Lucas.

3. Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly
The Town of Tree Hill is rocked by the death of Quinton and each deal with the tragedy in their own way. Deb contemplates whether her and Skillz should reveal their relationship to their friends.

4. You Have to Be Joking (Autopsy of a Devil's Brain)
Sam has some earthshattering news for Brooke as she discovers that she is in fact responsible for a traumatic incident in Brooke's life. However, this may have a greater effect on Sam then it does Brooke as it pushes her into the car of a man that may prove harmful to both Brooke and Sam. Mouth and Millicent finally come to a decision on their relationship, forcing her to make a decision that could ruin her relationships with both Mouth and Brooke.

8299643,4,B001EWDXT8,"Customers should not have to buy additional items to stream movies and shows purchased on Amazon.  It is a financial burden for me to have to purchase a fire stick made by Amazon even though I have a Chromecast that works great.  I think it is outrageous to force customers to buy your product because you can, if they want to be able to stream.  I am very dissatisfied with the purchase of my very favorite tv series because i am limited to watching it on my ipad.  All because I purchased through Amazon. I bought 2 seasons from VUDU and that app gives me no trouble streaming to Chromecast. However the price per season was cheaper on Amazon.  Who wants to watch shows on a small iPad when I have a very nice tv.  I feel that if customers are purchasing through Amazon then Amazon shouldnt make life so difficult! Not everyone wants an Amazon Fire stick.  I certainly DO NOT want Alexia or and voice control feature in my home. There again Amazon is forcing customers a feature they may not want because you cant just get a Fire Stick with a regular remote.  My Chromecast functions just fine and it would be great if Amazon would stop trying to control customers and allow content to be streamed on any device!!  Im spending my hard earned money to Amazon then I should be able to watch the shows/ movies on any device I want, including streaming through Chromecast!!!!",1515196800,,1373,4.46
