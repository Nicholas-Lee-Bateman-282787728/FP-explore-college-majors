3528504,5,B001DDBD4K,"All three of these movies are very good movies.  The two James Garner movies are comedies and I just love them. (Support Your Local Sheriff and Support Your Local Gunfighter)  The Paul Newman movie ""Hombre"", is a good western.  It has the good guy who could be a bad guy and the bad guy who is really bad.  Richard Boone plays the bad guy and does it very well.  Love this movie.",1240963200,9,379,4.208333333333333

3528506,5,B001DDBD4K,"Hombre is of course one of the best westerns ever made with Paul Newman as the leading man, and Richard Boone at his best in the role of evil villain.  I cant say enough about this movie, but if you like action westerns you should have this one.

The two James Garner movies are also some of Garners best work as comedian.  They are funny and enjoyable to watch and two of the better of the western comedies avaialable.

What you get is three good westerns for the price of one, so this is a bargain by any standard.",1452902400,,516,4.181818181818182

3528515,4,B001DDBD4K,"I've always liked James Garner, from Maverick to the Great Escape. In two of the movies in this three pack, he plays a reluctant hero, funny, practical and quick on the draw. The first, ""Sheriff"" was so good, they made it again in ""Gunfighter"". Hombre is different. Paul Newman is a white man raised by Indians. He gets drawn back into the white man's world and it is not nice. There are some really good action scenes plus some thought provoking ones. It is not a ""typical"" Paul Newman film, but still worth seeing.",1444262400,,516,4.5

3528564,5,B001DDBD4K,"The two James Garner films are ""Maverick"" with another monicker movies - light-hearted, fun to watch with good supporting casts, direction and story lines.

""Support Your Local Sheriff,"" released in 1969, is a comedic western with a cast that includes Joan Hackett as a klutzy cowgirl who eventually gets her man, Harry Morgan as her father the mayor, Jack Elam a ne'er-do-well come reluctant deputy,  Bruce Dern, a family's black sheep and Walter Brennan as his family patriarch, along with Garner (who is just on his way to Australia).  You'll laugh a lot at this family fare.

""Support Your Local Gunfighter""  was released in 1971 and though, from it's title, you would think it a sequel to ""Support Your Local Sheriff,"" it is not.  A parody of ""A Fist Full of Dollars,"" it has a different comedic plot from the first film.  This time the familiar cast (by face, if not by name) supporting James Garner as Latigo Smith, an itinerant gambler/conman, includes Harry Morgan and John Dehner as competing miners, Jack Elam again as Garner's dupe, Dub Taylor the town doctor, Suzanne Pleshette as his daughter who desperately wants to go to New York, Marie Windsor as a former gal-pal of Latigo's.  Others include Henry Jones,  Ellen Corby, Kathleen Freeman, Joan Blondell, Willis Bouchey, Grady Sutton and in an uncredited role as Swifty Morgan, Chuck Connors (of Dodger baseball and ""The Rifleman"" fame).  The story is silly and slapstick and funny.  A joyful laughable movie for the family.

""Hombre"", from the novel by famed western writer, Elmore Leonard is one of Paul Newman's best as directed by Martin Ritt (who also directed Newman in ""Hud"" and ""The Long Hot Summer"".)  While Newman's character of a white man raised by Apaches, has little to say, Newman never-the-less says much through body language and facial takes.  Filmed on location, mostly in Arizona, cinematography was done by the famous James Wong Howe.  Music for the film was by David Rose (composer of ""The Stripper"" and ""Holiday For Strings""). The supporting cast members are Barbara Rush in a pivotal role, Frederic March as her greedy husband and, in one of his best turns as a bad guy, Richard Boone (you may remember him as good guy Paladin of ""Have Gun Will Travel""?)  Others include you'll recognize are Diane Cilento, Martin Balsam, Cameron Mitchell, Frank Silvera and David Canary.  Released in1967, it more than doubled it almost six million dollar budget at the box office.  Rotten Tomatoes gave it 100%. I think it is one of the best 100 westerns ever made.  That may not sound like much, but there have been thousands of western movies since motion pictures began and to be in the top one hundred is a place of honor.

Put these three movies together and you've got a winner for western fans.  If you don't have these, now is the time to get them in a three pack for less than ""Hombre"" alone.  Who wouldn't want two James Garner films for what amounts to free?

Each film in this three pack comes in its own case.  Hombre is not rated.  The others are rated G.",1397347200,24,3044,4.752380952380952

This three-pack is a bargain, much cheaper than buying either of the two Garner movies separately -- and that's before you even count the Newman. I haven't watched ""Hombre"" yet. It looks good, and I'll probably like it -- just how awful can a western with Paul Newman be, anyway? -- but the Garner movies are the real attraction here and by themselves are worth the price of admission.",1390608000,8,609,4.700934579439252
