8100278,4,B000CPK3UA,"This videocassette (or DVD) is another essential product for a Seattle Mariners fan. This season wasn't special because of the Mariners playoff series victory, but for the regular season. The Mariners made history as they matched the record of the Chicago Cubs of 116 regular season wins...and the record had gone unmatched since 1906! It had been almost an entire century but the Mariners did it without A Rod or without Ken Griffey, it was a team effort. Unfortunately the program never got exciting for me, while yet it would be thrilling to be there as this unsurpassable record was getting closer and closer to being passed, it's just not as interesting seeing highlights on tape. I was also a little disappointed in the coverage of the playoffs, it was surprisingly brief. I think if there was more coverage on the playoff series victory it would make this tape more exciting. Nevertheless the overview of the season is interesting.

Just imagine how packed Safeco Field must have been during that season, I've been to a few games and it was very loud and exciting, just an incredibly gorgeous stadium, but to be sold out on numerous occasions, it must have been an unforgettable experience, and that's why I'm recommending this program, anyone who experienced the 2001 season or wants to learn more about this history making season should buy this tape, (or DVD) it may not be thrilling, but it's an important part of the Seattle Mariners history.",1283990400,,1454,4.862903225806452
