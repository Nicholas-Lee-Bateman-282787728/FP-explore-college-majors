8260745,5,B00164GZCQ,"This is a great video. She goes slow. Very slow. And then she speeds up. The camera angles are perfect for learning hand position and since she repeats the rhythms, it's easy to pause the DVD and do some practicing between sections. My machine doesn't chapter the DVD well, so finding your spot the next day can be annoying, but that could be the fault of my laptop and not the DVD",1438992000,,381,4.305555555555555

8260747,5,B00164GZCQ,"I purchased this dvd as a gift for a group of toddlers to play with a little bit of music instruction. A few music tutors had told me that the best way to start music education early is by making it fun and learning some simple patterns with basic instruments.
It worked out great. Some of the later learning sequences were a bit long for their under 5 year old attention span but the kids got a lot out of it anyway and the adults were super interested in the drum circle lessons.
Jill Sager has a very pleasant and approachable manner it was really fun to use it.",1391299200,2,565,4.192660550458716
8260748,5,B00164GZCQ,"Okay okay so it's pretty dated, and the teacher and her friends are a little bit hippie, but the lessons are solid.  She walks you through hand drums and other percussion methods that sound great together.  The video finishes up with a nice jamming session.

My son and daughter (2 and 4) have bongos and sat through the entire video and played along.  Dated or not, that's a huge accomplishment for kids so young.  They were mesmerized by such a sweet and soft-spoken teacher.  All around great buy!",1369958400,3,500,4.625
8260749,5,B00164GZCQ,"Jill Sager is an extremely accomplished musician that does not let this fact get in the way of teaching novices or assisting the drummer who has made some progress accomplish more.
Some drumming videos focus too much on technique (IMHO). While technique is very important it can be laborious without being augmented by the real fun of actual playing. Jill strikes a wise balance between the two crafts.
This video will give you the fundamentals of basic African and Cuban drumming whereas some videos only give one or the other. The video also includes a booklet that augments and integrates well with the DVD. This is the original hand drumming video. There have been others that have copied it, but the first may be the best, ever!",1350518400,3,733,4.7795275590551185
8260750,5,B00164GZCQ,"A wonderful DVD, that even a neophyte like myself can learn from. Even though I believe I was born missing a rhythm bone, I truly enjoy attending the drum circle every week. This arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.",1312243200,2,229,4.609756097560975
8260751,4,B00164GZCQ,"I bought this DVD for my family who want to begin hand drumming. I rented it first from Netflix and found it was easy to follow and covered the basics of hand drumming pretty thoroughly and was fun to play along with. We bought it and have used it to begin our own little drum circle. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that is didn't give me quite enough info on picking a good drum for a beginner. She does cover the different types (i.e. wood or synthetic, real skin or synthetic heads, etc) and talks a little about the differences but being true beginners it would have been nice to have a little bit more recommendation on which is the easiest for beginners to start with. The DVD is easy to navigate through and find specific lessons you want to play. The instructor is pleasant and easy to follow. My 3 year old likes to play along with the exercises as well.",1252454400,8,882,4.224852071005917
8260752,5,B00164GZCQ,"I've played set drums for 20 years and wanted to expand my capabilities to include hand drums. I found this method to be incredibly well-structured. It gave me what I need to add congas to my professional show. At the same time, it is perfect for my 10-year-old students and everyone in between. The method shows all the basic techniques in easy to understand demonstration form. It provides a solid foundation while leaving room for the player to find their own sounds. Sager adds a touch of personal warmth and caring that make this method uniquely engaging. I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun while learning.",1208390400,4,632,4.754545454545455
8260753,5,B00164GZCQ,"I've never been a drummer nor particularly musical but once I took a class from Jill I knew I'd found something surprisingly liberating and exciting.  This book/DVD combo is a fantastic opportunity to have fun in a new kind of way.  At this price it also makes a memorable and affordable gift for someone.  Jill has brought together musicianship, psychological health, and community building in a completely accessible way. Quite a package that should be in every family's library.",1208131200,9,481,5.063291139240507
8260754,5,B00164GZCQ,"This DVD/Book combo is the best product I have seen in the market to learn about hand drumming. It is fun, interactive and really easy to follow, and you don't need to have any previous knowledge about music.

I totally recommend it to everybody who wants to learn hand drumming in a fun and interactive way.

Besides you can use this product with your family and friends, a really cool way to spend time together, and do something different that everybody can enjoy, no matter what age they are.

Give it a try, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!",1206316800,10,535,4.494845360824742
