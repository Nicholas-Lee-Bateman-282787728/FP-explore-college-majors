2265254,4,B00094AS5Y,"One disturbing aspect of American political and popular culture is a common prejudice against country people. As long as I've been here in the Milwaukee metro area, many of the locals seem to look down upon the folks living in the northwoods, especially the U.P. The most common postive reaction to ""Vernon, Florida"" in these reviews consist of laughing AT the people. One can understand the apparent local distaste for the movie.

""Vernon"" is indeed funny. The couple with the growing sand, the keeper of the gopher tortise and the turkey hunter are especially hilarious. The turkey hunter is probably the most quoteable character in a movie that I've seen since Carl Childers. He is also the most interesting and likeable. Many, many people who watch this movie find hunting a repellent activity. The extended time given to the turkey hunter in ""Vernon"" gives the open-minded viewer a chance to at least appreciate how much this ""sport"" can mean to someone. Maybe he is obsessed to some unhealthy degree, but I tend to think that's just the way he his.

The characters portrayed here remind me of some of the legendary eccentrics in west Iron County, Mich. Like the characters in ""Vernon,"" their quirks were generally accepted and among the locals they had their dignity. Some of the reviews here brag about taking trips down to Vernon to see if they can find people to laugh at. My suggestion to them is that it's unnecessary: there's enough daffiness to be found in their home state. Or the bathroom mirror.",1128038400,56,1511,4.8301158301158305
2265255,2,B00094AS5Y,"Being a big Errol Morris fan I was excited to find this in the local video store. Like other reviewers, however, I found it tedious and repetitive. Worse still was the plotless nature of it. I couldn't figure out the point of the movie (Disclaimer : I only watched half of it. Perhaps it all came together at the end.)

  If you want to see a good Errol Morris movie get ""The Thin Blue Line "" or ""Fog of War"". If you see this first it will put you off his other excellent work.",1126310400,6,477,4.053191489361702
2265256,1,B00094AS5Y,"Errol Morris made this documentary in 1982. I loved his Thin Blue Line, one of the most remarkable documentaries ever. Of course, that movie is notable because it succeeded in freeing an innocent man from Texas' Death Row. However, it's a mesmerizing movie on its own merits.

Not so with Vernon, Florida. The documentary is simply a patchwork quilt of various of the town's quirky residents just blathering away. One fellow just drones on and on about turkey hunting in the most repetitive fashion. I felt like the one who gets stuck listening to ancient Uncle Joe at the family reunion retell the same pointless stories over and over again. Another man, an octagenarian at the very least, keeps a menagerie of Southern wildlife. A Chicago-born transplant drones on -- well, about the nearby river and not much in particular. The only interesting interview was with the local Dogberry, who basically admits to staging a few speed traps around town.

I feel very unkind in not liking what was clearly a labor of love on Morris' part; however, I couldn't see the point of the movie. Life is different in small towns, quirkier somehow? We've lost this sort of slow-paced lifestyle and chatter in America? Something in the water in Vernon, Fla., is making people really weird -- in a stultifying kind of way? I really didn't see what Morris was trying to tell me.

My recommendation is that you instead see -- or see again -- Thin Blue Line or Morris' quirky Gates of Heaven. He seems to have picked up some tips on pacing and telling a riveting story since producing Vernon, Florida.",1125792000,6,1581,4.741818181818182
2265257,5,B00094AS5Y,"I came across this movie several years ago on IFC just flipping through channels. I was so excited I recorded the last part on vhs and occcasionaly watched it with friends. When it finally came out on dvd I had to have it and pre-ordered a few copies as gifts. The language is amazing. The insight into a culture most of us ignore is enlightening. Not to mention it's just plain funny, but I don't think demeaning.",1125014400,2,414,4.3896103896103895
2265258,2,B00094AS5Y,"Many of the other reviews of this movie are glowing, and I won't dispute them.  There are many fine features about the movie. Is it an interesting documentary? Yes. Are the people featured odd? Yes.

So why, despite all of the glowing praise, did I not like *Vernon Florida*?

There wasn't, so it seemed to me, a narrative thread. It was vignette after vignette as opposed to a cohesive narrative. And the one thing I want from a movie is some sort of plot. Even if the only reason for the plot to exist is so that one special effect after another can be shown.

I suppose if I had approached the movie as a cinematic portrait, this cod liver oil of a movie would have gone down better. But I don't want cod liver oil when I see a movie, I want maple syrup--something unchallenging that might not be totally real. Should I want something a bit more edifying, I'll reach for a book.

If wanting nothing more than diversion makes me a cinema philistine, then I am guilty as charged.",1124928000,6,980,4.362637362637362
2265259,5,B00094AS5Y,"I first watched this film when it was released.  Without any judgement of the people in the film, it is a true slice of a small community.  I have shared (carefully) with close friends and it is indeed addictive.  When I showed it to my about-to-be-wife, she had second thoughts about our marriage.  Now she quotes snippits of the film from time to time.  I have loaned out many copies, and they never come back.  It is truly a wonderful little movie and the best work Errol Morris created.  I have made the pilgrimage to Vernon twice and advice to the pilgrim:  Just say you like the town but DO NOT tell them you liked the movie.  They are a little uneasy about that.",1120694400,7,669,4.330645161290323
2265260,5,B00094AS5Y,"I moved to Vernon in 2002 and first rented the movie downtown at the video store/tanning parlor, next door to the Dixie Dandy and the old town hall. It is amazing how little the downtown area has changed since 1982. I love my new hometown and only wish I could have been around then to meet some of the stars. This is a classic documentary and just too much fun to watch. You'll be quoting your favorite characters for years to come.... 'That's a lot of water out there.  Yeah, and that's only the top.'",1116892800,11,503,4.294736842105263

Also, most of the participants have probably passed away by now so this is an amazing collection of the unique people that lived in the panhandle during the late 20th century.  This is a time and place that will never come again.  Well worth the time of viewing.  I laughed my ass off and am still amused each time I view it!",1416873600,2,503,4.365591397849462
2265345,5,B00094AS5Y,"Beautiful piece of Americana that captures backwoods Florida of a generation ago. Erroll Morris documentary that catches the eccentricities and misinformation of small town pundits. Many of the lines in this film have been incorporated to catch lines embedded in our family legends, e.g, ""a fine piece of meat for the dining table."" ""Sand grows,"" according to one couple and they swear that a jar of sand has increased its volume several fold over the years. Helps understand belief systems that emanate from superstition; misinformation; and non-empirical fairy tales.",1414972800,,569,5.404494382022472
2265346,4,B00094AS5Y,"I remember seeing this when it was first broadcast on PBS. It was just as enjoyable the second time around. Don't watch it when you have something real important to do. Rather, when nothing else is pressing, get something good to drink and settle down to get a good insight into some interesting characters living (at least when the film was shot) in the south - particularly the panhandle of Florida. When I saw this the first time I had just moved from Florida to Michigan, however I had not encountered the kind of people that one finds in a small town in the Florida panhandle. I particularly enjoyed the tales from the turkey hunter. You don't run into someone like that in Orlando. Through it all one has to be careful as to what one believes. I have a jar of white sand and it has not grown to fill the jar (I obtained the small sample after I had seen the show the first time). Since seeing this the first time I had the opportunity to travel to Florida from Texas and purposely took a detour to Vernon. Yes it is there and having seen the show a second time, it looks like it does in the show. The show is well done but if you watch it, just relax and enjoy it.",1413244800,2,1170,4.204444444444444

This is a cool story about some of the characters living in this small town. I should exercise caution showing it to my friends because they will either love it or not talk to me until I seek counseling. Makes me laugh, so who cares. I had recorded it years ago and when it became available, I had to get a professional production.

If you profess to be high brow or have snoot in your pants, put it down and walk away after announcing you have left the building so everyone (in your imagination) can be impressed.. If you don't care what anyone thinks because you didn't buy it as a gift, go for it.

One man believes that you have sections of your brain that controls how many things you can multi-task at once....so he claims to have 5 bowls of brains which means he can do 5 things at once.  ;) Another couple claim that sand can grow, cause every night the street sweepers sweep it off the road and by morning ""it's dun grown back over the road""

2265392,3,B00094AS5Y,"Saw this film on IFC years ago and found it again recently. I'm not sure why this little gem ends so suddenly and unexpectedly without even a decent fade out. It just seems to end in the middle of one of the story/interviews and really doesn't go back to cap off any of the other stories or offer any kind of wrap up. It just STOPS! And that really hurts the flow of this otherwise wonderful documentary. The other star gets taken because you really have to turn your volume up to hear everything and its doubly frustrating because parts of the film really do rely on the sound being excellent quality, which is lacking. It also doesn't help because some of the dialect used is a little difficult to understand and the muddled sound confuses things said even more.
I don't agree with many of the other reviews relating to its making fun of people or being mean spirited. In fact, I think that this film should be in the National Film Preservation Registry for its capture of a culture and way of life that is rapidly fading, if not gone already, slice of American humanity.
If one choses to see these people as ignorant and uneducated, and thus funny, rather than seeing them as totally connected to their home and place in ways that no college or school could ever instill, then the point is missed here, I think.
Still, this is a great documentary that doesn't need a storyline or plot because it is what it is.",1360972800,3,1413,4.438461538461539

This film could have been equally as good if not better than all the rest. Morris had heard about a rural town in Florida where people had been severing their limbs in order to receive insurance benefits. Certainly there's some substance there - something interesting - not just in the brutality or absurdity but in what it says about us inhabitants of Late Capitalism.

But then once he got to Vernon, FL and started filming, he found extreme resistance-- he actually received death threats warning him against including anything related to limb-severing in the film. Understandably, he abandoned the storyline. The result is a movie that is literally about nothing.

What's worse is that the movie ends up having a thick whiff of elitism. That's because Morris salvaged his funds by interviewing local eccentrics and including their goofiest quotes in the final cut. Because there're no events and no storyline, we don't get to see who the people really are; we only get to laugh at their surface personas. It's as though we're people-gazing from the sidewalk.  If this movie appeals to us at all, it appeals to the worst parts of us.

2265431,5,B00094AS5Y,"Errol Morris is perhaps one of the most ingenious and prolific documentary film maker of our time.

There are camps, each decisively divided when it comes to Errols documentaries. Those that despise them - an those, like myself who relish every moment of any  Erroll Morris film. Best known for ""Gates Of Heaven"" which Rodger Ebert considers on the best films ever made - and although I love that film I find Vernon Florida to equally - if not more engaging.

It would be dismissive to call this film a comedy, it's a detailed study of ordinary people in a small rural town who, considering their eccentricities are anything but ordinary. The film is quite like being pulled into a still photograph. There's an odd sense of familiarity about it. Regardless of where you're from, or the life you lead. Morris excels where he always does - and that's his sharp, unblinking eye to the human condition and experience.

All is never what it appears to be in Vernon, Florida, the dying art of fine story telling, odd and quirky people who remind us not only of the characters who've shaped our lives - but of ourselves. Morris holds up a mirror here - we catch a glimpse of ourselves from time to time and smile.

It's simple, but still waters run deep. Vernon, Florida is more than a solid documentary. It's a slice of Americana, a bit of living history and sheer brilliance.

If you're new to Errol Morris or a long time fan - I suggest the three DVD set which includes:

*The Thin Blue Line

*Gates Of Heaven

*Vernon Florida

It's a marvelous collection and a must have for any Errol Morris Fan.",1337472000,,1593,4.538461538461538
2265432,5,B00094AS5Y,"When I've driven through sleepy tiny northern-central Florida towns like this, where you don't see many people, I've wondered what the locals were like.
Now I know.  Hunting, fishing, preaching, worm farming, are some of the things that occupy some of them.

One old man boasts of buying his house for twenty two hundred dollars, and says he pays no real estate tax on it due to his old age. He looks very content and pleased at this.
I personally loved this.  I love to see how people live in this country that is different from how I live.  There is a true wierdness here and it fascinates me.  The accents are rural and take some getting used to.  The inhabitants sound like they aren't terriby bright but I am guessing that no one would be after a lifetime spent in a place like this.  It's a beautiful natural area.  The men here seem to enjoy the experience of telling their thoughts to a camera.  If you like seeing slightly odd places and people in the USA you will enjoy this.

One man is obsessed with hunting turkeys and even has the feet and ""beards"" of turkeys he shot mounted and displayed on the outside of his pink trailer and will happily repeat the stories of exactly how he killed them for anyone willing to listen.

Vernon Florida was once a laughingstock for being nicknamed ""Nub City"", for having the highest rate of self inflicted mutilations to collect insurance money.  This tiny town of less than eight hundred people had the highest rate of accidental amputations in the country.
When a reporter asked a city counselwoman how her husband had lost a hand, she replied
""I think you know.""

It was for this reason that the filmaker originally was drawn to Vernon as a place to film a movie.  He had lined up some of the people with missing limbs who had collected insurance money but had to abandon this theme when he was threatened with murder.  He still was able to find enough odd characters to make an interesting film.",1333929600,2,1947,4.507122507122507

But for many of us, it was a ""wtf?"" moment.  What kind of retards would vote for George W. Bush?  This DVD helps to answer some of these questions.  It captures the Panhandle psychosis familiar to those of us who spent some time there.  Highly recommended.",1327708800,,518,4.565217391304348

2265477,2,B00094AS5Y,"I love documentaries, and I really appreciate some of Errol Morris's efforts to shine a light on eccentric characters and cultural phenomena that dot the American landscape.  But this little film failed to capture my imagination. My jaw dropped several times while watching it; however, it wasn't because I was shocked or busting out laughing.  It was to yawn. The turkey man was mildly amusing, but I've met more interesting characters on a romp through Walmart.  Also, I was appalled at the quality of the film.  I realize it was filmed before HD and all our fancy video toys of today, but I had a video camera back in that era and captured some excellent footage of my crazy cat. So I would think a film expert like Morris could have done a better job.

Vernon, Florida would have done better in the hands of Forrest Gump.  At least the viewer would have gained a little wisdom at the end.

One positive:  this little film was cheap on Amazon.  So if you're looking to fill out your Errol Morris collection, you won't have to miss a mortgage payment.",1305244800,,1053,4.558510638297872
2265478,3,B00094AS5Y,"Errol Morris's 1982 documentary Vernon, Florida, is rife with a great backstory; one that is interesting as the quirky townsfolk it portrays, This was Morris's second stab at the documentary form- after his earlier Gates Of Heaven, and it detailed the ramblings of a number of wacky folk from the town. Initially, the legend goes, Morris was drawn to Vernon- a Panhandle town, because, over the prior quarter century dozens of residents had taken up the bizarre practice of cutting off assorted limbs of theirs to collect large insurance payments. The working title of the film was Nub City, but Morris changed the title and focus once several people threatened his life. Morris is said to have chimed in, `They literally became a fraction of themselves to become whole financially.' Yet, the truth is that the sorts of wacky folk portrayed live all over America, and the world- I saw them growing up in New York City, I've seen them in Midwestern suburbs and Great Lakes fishing towns, as well as the heart of Texas. Thus, the thing that I found the most interesting was that this 56 minute long film was not originally a theatrical release, but made for WNET, the New York City public television station. Given how formulaic most PBS documentaries have become in the quarter century since this film's release, that, alone, is a fact worth pondering.",1283299200,3,1351,4.852813852813853
2265479,4,B00094AS5Y,"""Vernon, Florida"" is an extremely quirky stream-of-consciousness documentary by Errol Morris about a tiny Florida town that time forgot, and the people who live there. The film's narrative is told through interviews with several loveable and unusual people, who have often-amazing viewpoints. Most heavily featured is a turkey hunter, who has some odd thoughts, expressed in various degrees of eloquence, but whose conversational dialogue is eminently memorable for both his observations and his turns of phrase. I was also taken by the police officer who sat in a conspicuous spot to deter speeding, but who couldn't do anything about it as his radar gun had been sent out of town for calibration. I appreciated his work ethic of pursuing a noble cause, even when his hands were technologically tied behind his back.

Probably my favorite character was the gentleman who explained about gemstone examination and how he took a picture of the sky through a camera held next to a pair of opera glasses (""I don't know if it's the moon or not; it looks like some clouds."") He was genuinely mesmerizing to listen to and I would have loved to have seen all the interview footage he participated in. I also loved the old gentleman with the unusual pets. I laughed out loud when he explained he wasn't holding a turtle, but rather a gopher, and that he was hoping to sell his pet opossum at auction for between $1200 and $1500. Understand that I didn't think these men were laughable, I thought they were loveable characters, and supremely interesting. Likewise at the end, I enjoyed the couple explaining how they took a driving vacation to the White Sands Missile Range, and collected some sand in a jar. They were absolutely convinced the sand was growing, and would soon outgrow the jar it was kept in. (""It grows!"")

I found the characters absolutely wonderful and was sympathetic to all of them. They reminded me of many of the vanishing small towns in America, and I found their tales disjointed and delightful. From the elderly pet owner to the preacher who earnestly prayed for a van (and got one), I would easily give the entire group of people interviewed five stars. I was sometimes uneasy that the final film may have been condescending to these people, and was encouraging entertainment through mocking these wonderful people with their strange habits, hobbies, pastimes, and beliefs. I think these people are wonderfully refreshing, and this is a documentary that's well worth seeing. It's certainly like no other.",1279756800,3,2521,4.943396226415095

2265481,5,B00094AS5Y,"I can say that this documentary truly captures the spirit of this area. I grew up (and am still living) in Bonifay which is a mere 8 miles from Vernon. I thought the documentary was true to life and very unbiased. I've read other reviews where people felt as if the Vernon citizens were exploited by the film's creator. Living here, I can assure you that these people were not exploited. If you were to spend an afternoon wandering around Vernon, you would still be very likely to run into these type of people who would corner you with their life stories and ponderings.

Coming from this area, I give this documentary five stars. It just captures the characters of the area in such true life details. Of course, we are not all eccentric turkey hunters or opossum keepers; however, you are very likely to run into these folks just itching to keep your attention for an afternoon.

I would like to note that in the South, we do have gopher tortoises, so when the gentleman says that his pet is a gopher, not a turtle, he hasn't lost his mind he just knows his reptiles. :)",1261612800,5,1072,4.436548223350254
2265482,2,B00094AS5Y,"I've always enjoyed Errol Morris' films. I really wanted to see ""Vernon, Florida"" when I saw that many reviewers compared it to ""Gates of Heaven.""  Unfortunately, this film was a major letdown.

The biggest problem with this film is that it is nothing more than a group of loosely-connected vignettes. Morris interviews people from Vernon. We've all known people who love to talk but who are not interesting. Watching this movie feels like being stuck in a car with one of those people. In this film, Morris seems to have had no intention of a telling a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.

To be fair, there are some funny moments in this film. However, after watching, I feel bad about having laughed. I must agree with the viewer from Nashville who said that in ""Vernon"" an elitist filmmaker encourages the viewer to look down upon his subjects. We see little indication that these people might have any redeeming insights into life and its challenges. While I didn't really want to hear these people pontificate, I did not want to make fun of them, either.

It's true that the stories of such eccentric characters as the turkey hunter and the elderly animal collector can be funny at times. But I found the whole thing rather mean-spirited, as you really aren't laughing with the people but rather laughing at them.

The film's country bumpkins may be a revelation to viewers from big cities. But Vernon, Florida isn't actually all that unique. I live in a small town outside of Nashville and have some equally oddball neighbors. I'm sure many others in rural America can say the same.

Fortunately, Morris found greater maturity in his later docs like ""Fog Of War"". But this early effort just seems to be the work of an elitist making fun of those he views as less intelligent. Skip it!",1218326400,5,829,4.75
