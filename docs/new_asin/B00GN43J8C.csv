8625028,1,B00GN43J8C,"Set aside that a few favorites get their butts kicked.  The new folks don't have the sparks that the old ones did.
The new female ref Kim flicks her nose at the beginning of each fight for what significance I cannot guess.  UFC is slowly
becoming a strictly low class affair.  I have purchased every one since the first and this will be my last.",1395100800,,345,4.276923076923077
8625029,4,B00GN43J8C,"The fight between Tim Elliott and Ali Bagautinov is exciting. Elliot's fighting style is crazy. His head is pushed forward. His hands are down and he keeps pressing forward.

The match between Josesh Koscheck and Tyron Woodley is won by a beautiful knockout.

The main event between Johnny Hendricks and George St Pierre is excellent. In my opinion, Hendrick's takedown techniques are better and he is a little stronger.",1393545600,,420,5.072463768115942
8625030,4,B00GN43J8C,"Beyond the lineup of the main card UFC 167 is important as it marked the 20th anniversary of the UFC.  Then, there was the draw of the main event which was one of the most talked about welterweight title bouts in quite some time.  Honestly speaking, if it weren't for UFC 166 this event would have likely gotten a perfect 5 star rating but following up what is likely to be ""event of the year"" can be difficult (even if I have lowered my expectations over the years).  The first detail that is the biggest difference between 166 and this card is the difference in prelims.  Many of the prelims (all but 2) end by decision and many of these prelims don't stand out in any particular way.  To be fair they're not terrible but if you're buying this event it's for the main card.

The first fight on the main card is Ali Bagautinov vs. Tim Elliot.  As far as flyweight fights go this is a traditional one based more on speed and technique rather than power.  It's a fairly balanced fight but the pace itself felt a bit slower than most of the flyweight fights between the higher ranked fighters of the division.  This one goes to decision with the victor looking good but I'm more interested in seeing how these two rebound after their performances.

The second fight on the main card is the first of the three big welterweight fights.  Josh Koscheck is a TUF 1 alumni most well known for his strong wrestling and powerful hand.s  His opponent, Tyron Woodley, is also a strong wrestler with powerful hands.  To me, two wrestlers often make for very fun fights stylistically and this fight very much follows in this mold.  These two guys come out swinging and while it doesn't end right away look for a finish in the first round by devastating fashion.  Honestly, it's one of the most brutal finishes I can remember seeing period.

Old time fans know Robbie Lawler mainly because he was a knockout artist and he achieved the same style many times during his stint in Strikeforce.  Since returning to the UFC he has continued his trend so new fans alike will also come to know Lawler thankfully.  This fight is fun thematically simply because Robbie Lawler, the veteran, was taking on Rory McDonald.  Rory McDonal, while not necessarily known as a rookie, is regularly renowned for being so talented at such a young age.  So, think ""old lion taking on the young one for a seat of dominance"".  Again, doesn't exactly fit but felt right during the fight as I watched it.  Now I'm sure people will disagree with me but this was fight of the night in my book.  It may not have been as close as the main event but I was all over the place with this fight emotionally as well as physically.  To me, the split decision call seems like a weird one but thankfully the fighter I believed to have one got the nod in the end.  Again, I highly recommend that you check out this fight.

The co-main event is a strange fight for me.  Rashad Evans and Chael Sonnen have been partners on MMA live where they comment on the many facets of the MMA world.  So, from that viewpoint this seemed like a strange matchup as friends don't often fight against each other in the UFC.  But there's another reason to me that just seemed like a bigger point to bring up.  Evans has frequently talked about dropping down to middleweight since being beaten by Jon Jones during their title fight (although he also has mentioned how bad he wants a rematch) and Sonnen has done the same earlier this year after fighting against Shogun.  So it seemed like a strange idea to fix two guys together when it seemed obvious that ranking was going to go out the window since they had announced plans to drop to another weight class.  The fight is quick and kinda lackluster in terms of impact.  It didn't feel important and while the victor looked strong the loser had the kind of performance one would expect going in against the victor.  To me, it just felt like a waste of time and didn't fit in with the kind of vibe the night was shooting for.

The main event, between Georges St-Pierre and Johny Hendricks, has been talked about quite a bit already.  The hype coming in was pretty high as stylistically this looked the fight that was finally going to give St-Pierre some real trouble given Hendricks's strong wrestling and powerful left. It was also a personal fight as Hendricks had thrown around a lot of accusations that St-Pierre was taking PEDs even saying how St-Pierre should be tested by the Olympic standards (although it was pretty hypocritical for Hendricks to say he wouldn't do it even after St-Pierre agreed to the testing).  So, like Jon Jones/Alexander Gustafsson this is a very, very close fight.  If you're like me, you've heard the debates back and forth and at this point in time it's really up to each individual person what they think happened as little has been agreed upon for this fight.  For me this fight left a few more questions than answers and that may be due in part to the post fight interview from St-Pierre (and subsequent news released just this past Friday afternoon).

After the main event I had a hard time deciding if the 20th anniversary was all it was cracked up to be.  Given the number of fights that were strong I have to say that the event is certainly worth checking out but honestly the main event is what will make or break it for many people.  Depending on where you fall on the St-Pierre/Hendricks debate you may not wanna buy this card.  Like I said, two of the main card fights are very good and certainly worth watching with a classic debate-worthy main event but to each their own.",1386979200,6,5593,4.496039603960396
