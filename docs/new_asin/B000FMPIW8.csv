8124737,4,B000FMPIW8,"""The Gronholm method"" (= ""El mtodo Gronholm"") is probably one of the best movies in Spanish I have seen this year. This film is a loose adaptation of a successful Spanish play, and is directed by a talented Argentinian, Marcelo Pieyro. What is more, it has an excellent cast that makes you believe that what you are seeing is actually happening, and in a sense, that can be true.

What do I mean by that? Well, the story is about seven candidates that want the same job in a very important multinational, and the things they are ready to do in order to get that job. To start with, they are more than ready to participate in ""The Gronholm method"", a method the Human Resources Department of the multinational uses in order to choose the best candidate, and that involves turning the candidates against each other. Doesn't something like that happen sometimes in real life? It hasn't happened to me, but...

I must say that at times it is difficult to watch how far some people are ready to go in order to achieve the first place in the rat race. All the same, it is impossible to deny that this is a provocative film that gives food for thought, with a good plot and some unexpected twists that you won't see coming. On the whole, the kind of film you are not likely to regret watching.
