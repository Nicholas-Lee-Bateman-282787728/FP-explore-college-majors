8488815,1,B005XO9FLI,"This film is set in modern-day times of 1950. It is about a well-to-do, family helping a poor family. I like old movies from the 30's and 40's; however, this movie, made in 1950, is very boring. It has no plot other than the daughter urging her father to help poor people.",1496448000,,272,4.25
