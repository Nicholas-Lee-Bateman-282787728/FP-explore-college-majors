7951403,2,B00005R1NA,"Godzilla vs. Megalon is kind of like two movies in one.  The first hour or so is the weak plot.  Nuclear tests have upset the Seatopians (and apparently their buddies in Dimension M).  You get to learn a little ""history"" about the ""3 million year old figures on Easter Island"".  Well, who cares anyway?
The last part of the movie is really the only place with monsters.  Sure, you get a few peeks earlier on, but they are just posing.  The end has a tag team match between Godzilla and Jet Jaguar (a cool robot who ""programs himself to increase his size"") on one side and Megalon (a giant hopping cockroach who can spit fireballs) and Gigan (a sort of mecha-penguin looking guy).  The model work is OK, but there is not much of it.  Most of this fight takes place in a big dusty open area.  Ho hum, kinda tame.
Now the bad part:  the video quality ranges from barely tolerable to terrible.  I kept expecting to see people's heads in front of the screen or commercial breaks!  Where did they get this?  At least the Simitar releases were pretty clean.  You might want to avoid this mediocre film until they get a better print.",1016409600,7,1125,4.398058252427185
7951404,1,B00005R1NA,"As other reviewers have stated, ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" is one of the most carelessly and hastily thrown-together Godzilla films but still gives great entertainment value. However, this DVD edition is of such poor quality that it's too hard to watch. It's in pan-and-scan rather than widescreen format, but that's just the beginning. The picture quality looks like the disk was mastered from a second- or third-generation EP speed videotape of a faded film copy covered with dirt and scratches, with frames missing and muffled sound. There aren't many of these Japanese films on DVD, which is too bad--there's a large audience for them. Many of those that were formerly available are now out of print and hard to find.  This disk does nothing good to remedy that, and it's ironic that such a poor quality edition would even be released in the DVD format. It's priced very low, but that's no excuse. Other companies have released similarly-priced DVDs, using good transfers from decent copies of the films. Japanese monster movie fans can only hope that a more conscientious company will release some of these titles in the future. Worst Godzilla DVD ever!",1014249600,4,1154,5.010416666666667
7951405,2,B00005R1NA,"Made in 1973 and not seen in the US until 1976, Godzilla Vs Megalon is regarded by some as, arguably the series lowest point. It suffered mostly from what other Toho productions of the 1970's suffered from-a meager budget. Some of the shots of Godzilla are stock footage from '60's productions and the new ""Godzilla suit"" for this film is noticably different and simplified. The one scene that is quite spectacular is the destruction of a dam by the insect-like Megalon,while scenes of destruction(buildings etc) are more stock footage which is obvious from the differing film stocks seen. Japan was in a ""Super Hero"" craze in l973 which explains the inclusion of Jet Jaguar,an Ultraman-like flying and size-changing robot. Also, the monster Gigan is along for the ride but some of the fights become just too silly-at one point Godzilla shakes hands with Jet Jaguar!!!
This is also the first Godzilla film seen in the US to feature the dubbed ""International Version"" which, unlike many of the ones dubbed with more care in the US, in the l960's and early 70's, is pretty poorly done. But, for the Godzilla Completist, this film is probably better seen on DVD.Generally speaking,if you're in the mood, the film is alot of fun,and if you ask any Godzilla fan, a simple Godzilla suit is better than a CGI Godzilla any day, as, despite the film's shortcomings, there is still charm in this type of film, no matter what the budget. There is also a cameo appearance by actor Robert Dunham, who just recently passed away.",1002585600,2,1514,4.804597701149425
7951406,1,B00005R1NA,That pretty much sums it up.  Gigan's return was mabye teh only good part.  Jet Jauger was the cheeziest and most stipidest thing in a G movie.,924220800,,143,4.2592592592592595
