As an avid Seagal fan, who has seen ALL his movies, & owns several of them; I have been disappointed in the past by some of his releases.

Foreigner being one of them.

Flight of Fury is an excellent show! I thought the fight scenes were ok, not as good as we have seen before...but good.

I will be buying this one! SEE THIS MOVIE!",1172275200,9,393,4.064935064935065

2711913,1,B000LPR6G0,"Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Steven Seagal. I love his movies, even the newer ones; I thought A Dangerous Man and The Keeper were entertaining action movies.

But Flight of Fury is horrible, downright devastating to watch. It took me three viewings to complete the film. It was slow-moving, and when there was action, most of it was stock footage of fighter jets dancing around in the skies. When I watch a Seagal movie I want to see Seagal breaking dudes' arms and tossing them, in slo-mo, through storefront windows, I don't want to see fighter jets doing stunts in the sky. For that, I'll watch Top Gun.

Another thing that hurt this movie was Seagal was barely in the thing. You hear his voice a lot as he flies his jet, but then it's not even his own voice. It's a voiceover actor! I know he uses a voiceover actor in most of his newer movies, but some of them aren't too bad. Most of the time, they are used to correct the sound in scenes where it appeared his voice was too low and inaudible. But when you have a movie where you barely see his face, and you rely on hearing his voice, it does more damage than good. Hell, most of the time I didn't even feel like I was watching a Seagal movie.

If you're a diehard Seagal fan, check it out; just to say you saw it. If you're not, stay away, stay far away...",1307664000,3,1332,4.155038759689923
2711914,4,B000LPR6G0,"It's been a while since the brothers Sid visited a film from one of the worlds greatest, also most robust, action super stars. Steven Seagal is a legend whose appetite is as furious as his life altering fighting style. The man is a powerhouse of victory no matter what film he stars in. Yeah we know you're saying that he died in Executive Decision, but he saved the whole plane full of people so that point is not valid. He just won't be killed off by any force similar to the likes of Michael Myers. Sure he now pumps out some of the worst cinema on the planet, but that's yet another reason why we love him. In Flight of Fury Seagal shows again why he is one of the true kings of B.

He plays a character named John Sands, yeah his name is John in like 74% of his movies, who was wrongfully imprisoned in a military detention center. He's currently waiting to have his memory wiped clean due to his vast top secret knowledge, but naturally he has different plans. A military detention center can hold Seagal about as well as a buffet that just put out a fresh tray of crabs legs. He snaps a few necks and hits the road back to his old sgt that desperately needs his help. John Sands now must travel through Afghanistan airspace to recover a stolen stealth bomber. Of course Seagal just happens to be the world's best fighter pilot in the history of aviation, so he saves the day while leaving a heavy body trail in his dust.

It was quite refreshing getting to watch our 300+ pound friend work his movie magic in the way only he can. No matter what film he's in he attacks with brute force combined with the grace of a gazelle. Sure he's bloated and barely fits into anything wardrobe puts him in, but his lighting fast throat chops never seem to be affected. Now for most Seagal fans, Flight of Fury will be a big disappointment. But when you're a level headed B fanatic like Sid you feel a little different. By conventional means the movies a flop, but for us it was on the brink of a 5 star event. If there were a few more explosions sprinkled in you'd have a perfect watch.",1300838400,,2080,4.276649746192893
2711915,3,B000LPR6G0,"It was a cool dvd, a good movie not one of his best movies but ok to me, the plans were cool, i wish he would make more movies and not with words that not his own just subtitled words, maybe he can get back onto A list movies",1294358400,,225,3.6122448979591835
2711916,2,B000LPR6G0,"The style of Flight of Fury (2007) is kind of a throwback to 80's arena style military air adventures, though  the story is shaky story, and special effects subpar.  Steven Seagal is John Sands, an ex-air force pilot recruited for a mission to recover a stolen X-77 stealth bomber.  Sand's former student, USAF Colonel Ratcher (Steve Toussaint) has taken the plane to Afghanistan, where the Black Sunday terrorist group, plans to arm it with biological weapons, and then strike Europe and America.

Under the command of General Barnes (Angus MacInnes), Sands and Captain Jannick (Mark Bazeley), are sent to Afghanistan, backed by a SEAL team.  When the SEAL's are wiped out, and Jannick is captured, Sands turns to Jessica (Cierra Payton), an undercover agent, to try and salvage the mission.  With the help of Rojar (Alki Davis), another local ally, they mount a raid on the air base, and Sands manages to get the X-77 in the air.  It is along way back to Edwards AFB, with Ratcher in pursuit in an F-16.

Flight of Fury rates low marks for credibility.  We are in trouble, if the military chain of command operates anything like this, where clowns like General Barnes are running cowboy missions, just to cover his own butt.  Starting a war is evidently not a concern to Barnes, as he orders the destruction of the enemy base.

How Sands is able to land a USAF plane safely at an Afghan airfield is a mystery.  Since he departs in the X-77, his original plane was apparently left as a goodwill gift from America.  It is amazingly fortuitous that the beautiful Jessica, who coincidentally is a close friend of Sands, just happens to be living near where Black Sunday is headquartered.

The 'special' effects for the stealth effect are passable, and the brief air battle relies heavily on editing to convey the impression that the action is continuous.  It appears that stock footage was used for some of the battle scenes, both in the air and on the ground.  The fight scenes are rather messy, and not that well done.  The dialog throughout the film is horrible, with hardly a line not sounding like some stupid clich.

Flight of Fury is cartoonish effort that's mildly entertaining if you turn your critical meter way down.  The script is reality challenged, and the budget was probably insufficient to provide decent special effects.  The wide scope of the film, deflects the focus from Seagal, which probably serves well here, as being an obedient subordinate that follows orders, really isn't his thing.  Presentation is widescreen, and like Seagal's previous direct to video releases, the DVD contains no bonus materials.",1258848000,,2627,4.858426966292135
2711917,4,B000LPR6G0,"I'm not sure why people are trashing on this film. Sure there are a few inconsistencies in the story but this is actually one of the better Seagal films I've seen recently. I'm more of a fan of his military-style movies (which this one is) rather than his cop films. There's a lot to like in this film if you are a Seagal fan or a fan of military-style B-movies. The fighting and action scenes look pretty well done and unlike a couple of his recent films I've seen, it's not obvious that a stunt double is doing most of the work. There is some cute girl on girl action, though brief (LOL) and some cool military aircraft. All-in-all I liked it.

**contains spoilers** At the end of the film, why does the black pilot worry about chasing down Seagal's character in air? He's trying to talk Seagal into landing the stealth so that they can sale it on the black market, but if Seagal was going to consider this, wouldn't he have done that back at the hangar before they got into the air? Plus, once it's clear that Seagal isn't going to land the stealth, why does the black pilot knowing he is in an inferior plane, attempt to shoot it down? He's already received a large sum of money that he got from the Arabs when he killed the main ""bad guy"" and before he killed him, he already found out that the wire transfer had been initiated. So why not just fly off in the F-16 which is probably worth some money on the black market as well, and keep the money he's already got? I suppose you could argue that it is a ""pride thing"" - the student wanted to defeat the master, but it's a really weak plot point in my opinion.",1249776000,2,1615,4.2435064935064934
2711918,2,B000LPR6G0,"How versatile and unpredictable is Steven Seagal? Mind you, I'm not referring to his fighting skills or his resourcefulness as an actor, but rather to the fact that he can make a film as bad as ""Flight of Fury"" here and follow it up with the much-applauded&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>&nbsp;shortly afterwards. Seriously, I have no idea how he does it...and neither, given his iffy track record, does he.

The story: after escaping from a memory wipe session by military minds wary of his acquired knowledge, pilot John Sands (Seagal) is recaptured by the Air Force but offered his freedom in exchange for bringing back a stolen prototype stealth bomber set to be sold by a treasonous jet ace (Steve Toussaint,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-of-Persia-The-Sands-of-Time/dp/B003UYUQZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>). Aided by a young airman (Mark Bazeley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Damned-United/dp/B002LE8MP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Damned United</a>), John must travel undetected into northern Afghanistan, retrieve the plane, and try not to get killed by the guerrilla group hoping to make deadly use of its technology.

For some reason, I was hopeful about ""Flight"" being a good action flick - the cool effect used in the opening credits helped cultivate this - but I was soon brought back down to earth when it became clear that this is just another run-of-the-mill Seagalian DTV drag. The first line uttered by Seagal's character is dubbed by another actor and the majority of his dialogue remains this way: ""Flight"" matches&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Force/dp/B000ION79Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Force</a>&nbsp;for sheer amount of dubbing, so we can be sure that Seagal himself wasn't attached enough to this movie to redo his own lines in post-production. Still, that doesn't mean his ego can't be dutifully stroked: besides his character being lauded as both the best pilot and martial artist in existence, he gets to kiss the red-hot Ciera Payton on the lips and call her ""babe"" (then again, so does Katie Jones), and keeps his title of ""most unbeatable action hero"" throughout some pretty lackluster fight scenes and shootouts. There's much less doubling than usual when it comes to the hand-to-hand stuff but it's all still pretty uninspired.

To the film's credit, the editing and cinematography - with the exception of the stock footage used for almost every shot featuring an airplane - is a step above average for Seagal's flicks. Seagal also looks in better physical shape than he did for his last few outings, the supporting cast does its best, and the assault on the terrorist base near the end of the film is thoroughly decent, giving Alki ""Kiss my big, fat Arab a--"" David (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bank-Job/dp/B0019EXZY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bank Job</a>) a moment to shine. Still, the movie moves at all-too-slow of a pace for any kind of action movie and any and all scenes featuring flying aircraft are best left forgotten; a shame that these encompass a large part of the movie. Rest assured, this is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Gun/dp/6305127689/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Gun</a>&nbsp;- just a patchwork of recycled footage and ideas that must be viewed in the company of one or two hotdogs or a distracting home-improvement project to be fully enjoyed.

Since it was followed by ""Urban Justice"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pistol-Whipped/dp/B0011VIO4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pistol Whipped</a>, I hope that ""Flight of Fury"" marks the end of the long procession of so-bad-they're-good films for Steven, because not even his fans want to see much more of this. Thus, I'd recommend the film only to fans that have not yet been too jaded by the likes of his recent films to give this one a buy.",1213833600,,4222,6.187393526405452
2711919,1,B000LPR6G0,"You don't need much time to realize how bad ""Flight of Fury"" is going to be. The first terribly boring 15 minutes where two ""action"" sequences are set up would be enough. One is about Steven Seagal's character John Sands escaping from some facility because someone thought he knows too much and his memories should be erased. The other sequence is about a newest model of Stealth fighter that literally becomes ""invisible"" (like someone has digitally painted), which is stolen during a military demonstration.

And both scenes are dull, with the actor who looks bored and the scenes that have no tension. The rest of the film is just a mess with lifeless acting, slack actions shot somewhere in Romania and stock footages of aerial sequences that do not match with other parts of the film. The character played by Seagal, who looks increasingly tired these days, is given a mission to retrieve the stolen fighter, but he is rarely seen doing the jobs as other supporting actors are doing them for him.

Among the numerous titles released from Sony, this is easily one of the worst, with no entertainment value whatsoever. (Oh, but there is one unintentionally funny scene where two ladies are seen hugging each other.)",1194480000,,1218,4.850961538461538

2711921,1,B000LPR6G0,"I counted 3 different voice dubbers to loop Seagal's voice at different points in Flight Of Fury. I have not had the pleasure of viewing Seagals Sci-Fi epic Attack Force but by all accounts it's worse than this and that is an achievement. How exactly did Seagal get from under the truck to on top of it without being seen by the security guards walking around the truck, checking underneath with mirrors? It must be so unbelievably difficult to climb on top of a truck and hold on for dear life at a life threatening velocity of 15mph that security guards due to the craziness of such a prison break escape scheme no longer check the top of trucks before leaving the prison grounds. Prisons have guard towers taller than 6 feet, right? Dreadful fight choreography made even worse by horrible camera work. A gas station store is being robbed by several thugs while Seagal is innocently buying coffee & probably all the dounuts the shop currently stocks. Compare this scene to the opening martial arts corner store being robbed scene in Hard To Kill and this demonstrates just how far Seagal as fallen. Much of the next 10 minutes of the movie has Seagal sitting in a chair barely forming the words for the terrible dialogue he has been paid a few $million dollars to say, while expanding the minimum amount of energy to keep his eyes open and looking as bored as I feel watching yet another Seagal straight to DVD embarrassment. Stock flight footage is used throughout this movie. I couldn't help but laugh at the stock footage whenever the Stealth fighter is operating on the ground, the pilot appears to have his visor down over his eyes but yet every interior sequence shot for the movie, has the actor who is pretending to be the pilot with his visor up. The film makers could not even get that right. Unconvincing CGI sequences, a very nice but completely unnecessary lesbian scene (the best part of the while movie!!) terrible amateur acting from almost every cast member, wrapped up in a stupid plot mish mash of Broken Arrow, Firefox, and any random soft porn movie! With badly executed and filmed action scenes. What was up with the Seagal pipe fight one on one scene near the end? It looked like an attempt at a slap stick comedy sketch or something that would not have been out of place in Batman & Robin. I just can't take Seagal anymore in these direct to DVD turds or listen to him crying about how he is being screwed over by producers. Stop signing contracts with these people. A piece of career advice for Seagal, sign on for a low -mid budget action film for Lionsgate ala Crank or Rogue Pictures ala Assault On Precinct 13 and take a big pay cut and work up from there. I still think Seagal has the potential to make enjoyable action movies even at his current age and still has something to bring to the cinema going public but I no longer believe Seagal has any interest in doing so. He seems happy to put his name on anything that will line his pockets and dump all over his once large fan base. Flight Of Fury should not only be avoided but boycotted.",1179792000,6,3073,4.508960573476703

Sadly, we have resorted to exchanging Seagal movies as gag gifts for birthdays and Christmas, I know that sounds harsh, but is there anything that can be done with these movies? C'mon, lets be sensible here, Seagal's movies used to be somewhat entertaining back in the day with things like 'Under Siege.'

There are a slue of high pyrotechnic explosions, a little gratuitous lesbianism that adds nothing to the storyline but comes as an unexpected development, much gunfire, Steven's usual muttered monotone, and some martial arts action.

The fairly chaotic screenplay manages to hold together despite its spit-for-glue quality.
