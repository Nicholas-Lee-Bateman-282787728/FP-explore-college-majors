4961784,5,B00664ALPS,"I LOVE this DVD. We just rented it from the video store and I will be buying it for sure. It teaches really great lessons like eating your vegetables, going to bed nicely, how to talk on the phone....

It is really cute too.",1338163200,4,224,4.090909090909091
4961785,5,B00664ALPS,"We bought this for our two year old to try to help her learn manners, etc. It's better than we hoped! It's even showing her the proper way to treat her sister by showing her how Kitty acts with her sister Mimi! It's beautifully done, incredibly helpful, and great for almost any age!!",1334880000,,284,4.377358490566038
4961786,5,B00664ALPS,"I am impressed with this DVD as well as ""Growing Up With Hello Kitty 2"". They teach good habits, and my daughters, 5 and 4, love them. I have noticed they are more responsible since watching them, which is a lot to ask from a DVD. I usually treat DVDs just as entertainment but I do think they learn good habits from this. The episode ""Sleeping By Ourselves"" in particular really seems to have helped them go to sleep alone in their bedroom.

<3 you, Hello Kitty and Mimmy!",1334534400,4,473,4.314606741573034
4961787,4,B00664ALPS,"I loved watching Hello Kitty when I was little, & I wanted my 2 year old daughter to experience the same cartoons that I did.  Let's face it, the cartoons these days aren't wholesome like the one's we had in the 70's & 80's.  They always had a good message to send to the kids, & the cartoons now make me feel like I'm poisoning my mind... as well as my daughters.  So, I ordered this Hello Kitty dvd, praying my daughter would like it.  Mission accomplished!!  She. Will. Not. Stop. Watching. It.  Seriously!  I have to put it in my dvd-rom on my computer, otherwise it monopolizes our t.v.!!  The only thing I noticed now, watching it as an adult, is that I notice Kitty & her sister Mimi have unnecessary anxiety.  Well, I feel it's unnecessary, but I suppose to a child it's a real possibility.  For instance, one episode deals with Kitty & Mimi's fears of learning how to answer the telephone properly for the 1st time.  In another episode, it deals with Kitty & Mimi worrying about their Mama falling ill... again, another justifiable fear for any child.  And another episode deals with the dislike & fear of eating bell peppers.  There are 6 episodes total, & each of them addresses an issue, & shows how Kitty & Mimi get through it.  :)",1421539200,,1244,4.422907488986784
4961788,5,B00664ALPS,"Really cute show that we stumbled upon at our local library. My kids loved it so much we bought it. And what a great price!

It's s bit outdated (in the way they talk to each other, use the house telephone, etc), but the lessons seem to be really topical and my children (ages 3 and 4.5) really enjoy it. The song is also very catchy (but lyrically odd). The best Hello Kitty show you can find on here (in addition to Growing Up with Hello Kitty Vol. 2).",1416700800,,454,4.101123595505618
4961789,5,B00664ALPS,Such a cute little movie that arrived quickly to show to my granddaughter! Thanks!,1415923200,,82,4.928571428571429
4961790,2,B00664ALPS,"I find this DVD very strange. The first episode is a stern and strange little lesson about little children eating their vegetables.  I'm all for this.  We are BIG vegetable eaters in our home!. However, this lesson starts off criticizing the two little Kitties/children because they won't eat green peppers for BREAKFAST! For heavens sake!  How about starting a lesson using a more common vegetable like peas, carrots, green beans or something!  My grand daughter looked at me with tears in her eyes and put her hand over her mouth and won't watch this now.  I tried to explain around this episode but it didn't work.",1412899200,,617,4.783018867924528
4961791,5,B00664ALPS,Granddaughter loved it!!!,1411257600,,25,7.666666666666667
4961792,5,B00664ALPS,Really nice video.  Now my daughter knows where hello kitty comes from.  She loves anything about hello kitty without knowing that it was a cartoon,1405209600,,147,4.84
4961793,5,B00664ALPS,So I'm not a fan of Hello Kitty but my 2 year old definitely is. She loves this movie. I recommend.,1403481600,,99,3.761904761904762
4961794,3,B00664ALPS,"I saw many good reviews about this video. My daughter is a big Hello Kitty fan and I was really putting a lot of hope in this video on changing her eating habit and sleeping habit. However, I found it just ok, to give credit on some chapters.

For changing Hello Kitty and Mimi's sleep routine, Kitty accidentally overheard if Mama doesn't get enough rest, she will get sick. Kitty feels bad so she stopped having her parents read for them. In reality, I really doubt kids understand this part unless they are old and mature enough to have the empathy. There are some part of the video more like parenting training, and some not quite realistic.

Although my daughter is a big fan of Hello Kitty, she gets bored of it quickly.",1400544000,2,726,4.451127819548872
4961795,4,B00664ALPS,"My daughter lived kitty and the prices was great. The DVD arrived faster than I expected. The content isn't ground breaking and the episode about answering the phone is a bit annoying since you hear a phone ringing frequently in that episode. My daughter didn't really learn anything, but she did say she wanted to try tomatoes (a food she said she hated) because Kitty tried them and has since accepted eating them. But I didn't really buy this for lessons, but to add to her kitty DVDs since we don't have any network or cable tv in our area.",1397606400,,544,4.45
4961796,4,B00664ALPS,"I think it is a little annoying,  but my 3 1/2 year old loves it! And that is what is important with a Hello Kitty DVD. It does convey a good message.",1394064000,,150,3.6875
4961797,5,B00664ALPS,My almost two year old loves this movie.  I highly Recommend it. Has some great points when it comes to learning different things.,1393286400,,130,4.6521739130434785
4961798,4,B00664ALPS,I got this DVD for my granddaughter who does not like to eat vegetables....she loves it and even tried to eat some veggies I made.,1388275200,,130,4.24
4961799,4,B00664ALPS,"This is the only video my 2 1/2 year old wanted to watch for over a week!  The lessons are good, but as others have said the voices do grate on your nerves, but it is for her not me =)  we also bought and are saving the #2 for her 3rd Bday.",1375142400,,240,3.509433962264151
4961800,5,B00664ALPS,"This DVD is great for little kids. My daughters (2 1/2 year old twins and a 3 1/2 year old) all LOVE this DVD. If I put it on, they usually stop whatever they're doing and come running for the TV. It's great when I need them to settle down! The episodes on this 45 minute DVD are:

1. Eating Our Vegetables (Kitty and Mimi learn to be less picky eaters)
2. Cleaning Up My Mess (why it's important to keep your room clean and organized)
3. Sleeping By Ourselves (about learning to fall asleep when it's time for bed)
4. It's Fun to Help (learning about helping others)
5. Talking on the Phone (learning how to answer the phone)
6. Changing Our Clothes (learning to get dressed by themselves)

Growing Up With Hello Kitty 1 and 2 are both really good, so I recommend getting both, but if you can only get one, I think this is the one to get.",1372377600,,839,4.172839506172839
4961801,5,B00664ALPS,My 2 year old daughter loves Hello Kitty and I discovered that most of the shows are not very positive and sometimes scary or rude. I'm glad I got this one! It's upbeat and has good lessons. She loves it!,1371254400,,204,4.125
4961802,4,B00664ALPS,"We bought this one after reading the other positive reviews and it didn't disappoint. My 3 year old really likes the skits in this dvd and I find them to be great lessons to learn in a positive way. The family unit is so important these days and this dvd includes mom, dad, and sis in every story. It's very loving and gentle. We bought the Growing Up With Hello Kitty 2 because we liked this one so much. #2 is great too!",1361836800,5,422,4.096385542168675
4961803,5,B00664ALPS,"When you have a strong-willed child who isn't always keen on listening to you (the parent) it's actually welcoming for Hello Kitty to take a stab at showing your cutie pie how things should be done...  We have Hello Kitty ""2"" from a store...and then found ""1"" here at Amazon.  They HAVE been helpful...",1359849600,4,302,4.574074074074074
