Sidney Carton, the dissipated and cynical lawyer who finally redeems himself in a single act of sacrifice, not only for a woman he loves, but for her happiness, her family, and ultimately for all mankind, is played superbly by Ronald Colman. So much so that I cannot read the novel (Ihave read it at least five times) without hearing Colman's inimitable voice on every page in which Carton appears. He becomes the character as thoroughly and finally as Charles Laughton became Quasimodo.

344054,4,6301696166,"A cynical and dissolute English solicitor (Dirk Bogarde) finds himself involved in the lives of a doctor (Stephen Murray) recently released from the Bastille after 18 years, his daughter (Dorothy Tutin) and a French aristocrat (Paul Guers) who has disowned his title and his family. But the long, bloody and vengeful arms of the French Revolution will impact their lives. The celebrated Charles Dickens novel had been adapted to film at least three times prior to this incarnation, most notably the 1935 MGM film with Ronald Colman. This is a solid and strong adaptation and, in several ways, superior to the 1935 version. I'm not normally a fan of Dirk Bogarde's ennui as an acting style but his weariness is perfect here. His Sidney Carton is much better than Colman's. Bogarde lets you see the dissolution in his face. This is a man for whom life holds no joy and no reason for his existence. Generally, the acting (except for Guers) is better including Rosalie Crutchley who makes for a sensational Madame DeFarge. Curiously, the director Ralph Thomas insisted in shooting it in B&W when color would have added some vibrancy to the proceedings. The large cast includes Christopher Lee, Donald Pleasence, Ian Bannen, Athene Seyler, Leo McKern and Marie Versini.

344055,4,6301696166,"A Tale of Two Cities, 1955 film

A coach drives along a road at night, heading towards Dover. One passenger drinks, Sidney Carton is his name. A rider carries a message for the other passenger. They stop at an inn. Miss Manette rides in another coach. Carton's character is shown. Lawyer Jarvis speaks to Miss Manette about her father's past as a physician. They show the power and cruelty of a French aristocrat towards his serfs. After 18 years the disappeared Dr. Manette was found. We see scenes of 18th century Paris. A barrel of wine falls off a wagon and breaks, people rush to swallow the wine from the street! Miss Lucy meets her long-lost father, held captive and suffering from mistreatment. They see prisoners being led into court in London. One man describes the penalty for treason. Darnay is on trial for being a spy. Was it planted evidence? He criticized Britain's war on America! Was it mistaken identification? The jury says ""not guilty"", the prisoner is discharged.

Carton is weary of the world. [Some psychological problem?] In Paris a child is killed by the coach of an aristocrat. The marquis insults the people in the street. The people have no bread? ""Let them eat grass."" Later the marquis pays a penalty for driving too fast. Carton visits Miss Lucy, he loves her. Doctor Manette accepts Charles Darnay. Did Barset die of drowning? He is back in Paris. Gaspar is taken as the assassin of Evremonde. Barset visits the Defarge wine shop and offers to help them. [Is he still a spy or provocateur?] One day the soldiers do not obey the orders of their officers. The Bastille is attacked by the people to obtain arms and ammunition. July 14, 1789 is a date that will be forever celebrated! Prisoners are released. Others are punished. There is chaos in the country. What crime have the servants of the aristocrats done? ""They ate while we starved."" Charles Darnay renounced his titles and lands in France.

Gabelle and his daughter have been put in prison. [Is this a trap for Darnay?] There are new laws and new offences, aristocrats have lost their lands and are subject to the death penalty. [No Bill of Rights for the people.] Dr. Manette and Lucy return to France. People have changed. Young Marie is condemned. Charles Evremonde is tried. Dr. Alexander Manette speaks for Charles. ""Not guilty."" But Mme. Defarge has an old document from Dr. Manette! Carton sees Barset in the court and talks to him about a deal. The people listen to Mme. Defarge's complaint. Evremonde is guilty! Now there is danger for Lucy, the wife of Evremonde. Carton explains what must be done. Evremonde has visitors. Carton dictates a letter for Charles to write. Mme. Defarge plots against Lucy. Barset removes ""Carton"" from jail. Miss Pross defends Lucy from a new attack. The name of ""Evremonde"" is called, the tumbril is loaded with the condemned. People cheer their passage to la Place de la Concorde. [Does this audience remind you of some TV shows?] Marie precedes Carton. Has he redeemed a worthless life?

I never read the book, this is a simplified version. It covers the main points, which contrast life in Great Britain (with its laws) to that in aristocratic and revolutionary France (or Europe). Dickens seems sympathetic to democracy but not any emotional excesses. Or was that in this movie version? Is the actor playing Carton provide a clue to this character? You should probably read the book first to understand what was left out or changed. The book should document life in that era. Does this story seem plausible? Too sentimental for modern tastes? Other novels by Charles Dickens were turned into movies.",1375920000,,3634,4.8096

The characters are cardboard, deeds are extremely evil or 100% noble/good, nothing in between, and watching the film unfold is like watching a film director painting unimaginatively by the numbers. Dirk Bogarde is studiously bored and a very unconvincing drunk. Even the storming of the Bastille is something perfunctory and dutiful.  Everyone is trudging wearily along the path marked out by Dickens, getting their time card punched and bored with what they're doing.

344061,5,6301696166,"Melodramatic to the utmost, this story is also rather superficial as for the French Revolution. Dickens does not like it but he has divided feelings about it. He is particularly obnoxious with the aristocrats before the revolution and does not seem to have any pity for them after the revolution and he shows them all powdered and wigged when going to the guillotine or in prison, as if on a sort of macabre parade.

He seems to ignore the Bastille was destroyed on the spot as soon as it was taken, though it might not be his mistake, like the mistake of the colors in 1789. White was the color of the king and the other colors where blue and red and they were those of Paris. The tricolor flag was still to be invented.

At the same time he is particularly hard with the hard liners on the revolutionary side, though they have some good reasons to be hard liners but does it help the revolution, is it going to bring comfort and food to the poor? The question is asked and cannot be answered anyway. The economy collapsed and the war effort sucked all energies and means. The revolution did not bring that comfortable welfare it was more or less dreaming of at the beginning and France will have to wait for the stabilization of the economy under Napoleon and the Empire to really see some better times, and yet the war effort was constantly maintained and nourished by Napoleon.

The great quality of the story is to bring together a physician who lived and worked in France for more than twenty years before the revolution and he could witness the extreme poverty of the people and condescension of the aristocracy. At the same time the daughter of this physician is in love and gets married to one of the two Saint Evremonde brothers after this particular one dropped his name, his title, his privileges and moved to England to work and live. But on a sudden whim, in a way, he comes back to Paris to support the main employee of the Saint Evremonde brothers, a rather unsavory character. He is of course arrested as soon as he arrives.

The ending is typical of Dickens. A good ending, though not entirely happy, thanks to a deus ex machina that is so improbable that we have to suspend any belief of any type to accept it. God is great for sure and miracles happen every day but that one is slightly overdone.

But the BBC more or less saves the story with a very good setting, directing and acting. Apart from some anachronistic elements the film is quite clear as for Dickens's ideology that justifies some violence because of the atrocities the aristocrats have perpetrated and at the same time his ideology is against that violence as being maybe not counterproductive but at least not very effective to produce what is expected from this revolution, that is to say human happiness.

344120,2,6301696166,"I wonder if any of the people who gave this film 5-star reviews have ever read the novel.  This is one of the most painfully awful adaptations of a classic that I've ever seen.  The creators of this film got everything wrong, from the writer's misbegotten decision to reveal, at the very beginning, ALL the shocking secrets that Mr Dickens felt were better revealed 3/4 of the way through the story...to messing with not only the timeline of the novel but also (painfully) of history...to the dreadful portrayal in the script (compounded by a stuffy actor) of Charles Darnay, in which a somewhat bland but sympathetic character is turned into a smug, snooty prig whose only positive attribute is his good looks.  What does Lucie (who is much too ditsy and simpering as portrayed by Dorothy Tutin) see in this pill? This major miscalculation, which probably was intended to make gloomy Sydney more attractive to us in comparison, simply makes us wish that Sydney would just let the creep get shortened and run off with ditsy Lucie himself.

This said, if you are a hardcore TTC fan, you should probably watch it for Dirk Bogarde, who is *almost* as good as Ronald Colman in the role of Sydney Carton.  Otherwise, skip it and watch the 1935 or 1989 versions instead.",1177459200,6,1264,4.7272727272727275
344121,5,6301696166,"Overall, these people did a good job of transferring this famous novel of Charles Dickens to film. To be sure, there were 3 things from the book I did miss. (1) The comical scene when Mr. Lorry keeps insisting to Miss Manette that he is: 'just an instrument, just a machine,' (2) The scene where Mr. Lorry slowly tells Dr. Manette that the shoe maker's bench must be destroyed, and (3) Madam Defarge's comeuppance. But other than that, the transfer of this novel to film is actually quite impressive. As in the book, Mr. Lorry tells Miss Lucille Manette that her father has spent many years in the French prison, but that he is alive and well. (Mr. Defarge is hiding him.) Mr. Defarge starts out nice enough, but like Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mr. Defarge is to eventually degenerate. After Lucille is reunited with her father, the story switches back to England.  Charles Darnay faces charges of treason. But through the help of the benevolent lawyers Mr. Stryver and Mr. Carton, Charles is released. As in the book, we learn that Mr. Carton is an alcoholic. Things are fine in England, but the threat of war in civil war in France between the under privileged citizens and the cruel aristocracy continues to keep the tension. At one point (as in the book) a young child is killed by Charles's uncle. Charles goes back to France for a short while to give up his position. (He can not stand the cruelty of the French Aristocracy.) While we may accuse Charles Dickens of national bias in favor of England, history is on his side. Generally speaking, the English monarchy was more receptive to the needs of the English. Charles and Lucille fall in love and are married. (Though Lucilles father is struck for a moment when he realizes who Charles is.) Moving on, war breaks out in France  between the aristocracy and the French citizens. (While this is an animated movie, parents may wish to screen it first and see if it is fit for young children. It's very good, but it does get violent.) Interestingly, Charles Dickens does NOT allow us to see the victory of the citizens as a happy end. (There is an especially cruel act of Defarge during the battle.) As in the book, Charles learns that one of his loyal servants is in trouble, and he risks going back to France, despite the warnings of Mr. Lorry. It is not long before Charles is taken and must stand trial. Charles Dickens uses a technique that was used by Cliff Marlowe in his ""Edward II,"" and William Shakespeare in his ""Richard II."" When the French citizens have power, they are actually worse than the French Aristocracy was when they had power, and our sympathy is shifted over to the Aristocracy. Power seems to corrupt whoever has it. (Pardon the cliche.) The once benevolent Defarge loses whatever sympathy we may have had for him when he uses old papers from Dr. Manette to seal the fate of Charles. In a clever use of a flashback, we see characters of both the aristocracy and the common people, and we see that Dr. Manette has been a victim not only of the French Aristocracy, but the revenge driven citizens of France. (One thing not in the book that I have to admit was a good change was that Charles delivers an articulate speech where he explains that he had nothing to do with any of the atrocities named before him: ""I renounced all title and claim to the Darnay family and fortune, in disgust at the Darnay family, and its crimes against the people of France."") But of course, the French citizens are not interested in facts or truth. They simply want vengeance. Most of you know that Mr. Carton sacrifices his life to save Charles. (These people add one more thing that Charles Dickens did not write. Lucille actually finds out what has happened and falls into utter sorrow.) Do not shun this movie because it is animated. While it does deviate from the book slightly, it still follows it quite well.",1153699200,3,3870,4.599131693198263

7813808,5,6301696166,"I suffered through A Tale of Two Cities when I was very young.  We did not study the story, we did not discuss the plot, the intertwined threads, the irony of the revealed identities of the various heroes and villains, the magnificence of the ending, the voyage of the characters.  No, my class was encouraged to find deep meaning in descriptions of mantelpiece decorations, in puns.  It was a colossal waste of time, and that method came close to spoiling a lot of splendid classics for me.

When the school year was over, my younger self was sitting in front of the TV, aimlessly looking for something to watch. The movie for that night was A TALE OF TWO CITIES with Dorothy Tutin and Dirk Bogarde.  There being little else to watch, and feeling a niggling curiosity to find out what the book really WAS about, I sat back and watched.  The movie did a fairly good job following the book.  In an hour-plus movie based on a multi-hundred page book, things have to be cut out, but they did a good job.  The actors performed their parts very well, and there were some familiar character actors in there.  It brought the book to life, and got me reading Dickens again.

I like Dirk Bogarde's interpretation of Sidney Carton.  He achieves shrewdness, suprising sentiment and intelligence.  His depiction of the change Carton goes through in the course of the book is very well done.  I have watched other versions of A Tale of Two Cities, but this remains my favorite, even as I acknowledge that Ronald Colman appears to be considered the best at the part.  For me, Bogarde captures the cynicism that hides his heart.

From a quality standpoint., this DVD functioned very well (I watched it on my laptop), with good sound and a good picture.",1440979200,5,1737,4.5941558441558445

For any Charles Dickens fan, the plot is a familiar one. British attorney Sydney Carton (Bogarde) loves Lucie Manette (Tutin), but she marries Charles Damay. The couple leave for Paris, which is in the throes of the Revolution. Damay tries rescuing a jailed aquaintance and is himself arrested and condemned to die. Barrister Carton, ever-devoted to Lucie, comes to the aid of the Damays through an act of genuine self-sacrifice.
