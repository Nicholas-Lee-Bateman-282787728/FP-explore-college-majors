8650443,5,B00JF5YMC8,"Perfect romantic comedy! Hero is smitten, bumbles around but is brave enough to overcome obstacles, heroine is beyond lovely, independent and no nonsense. Of course, this being a comedy, there are some exaggerated situations, but nothing feels forced. This movie is cute, hilarious and romantic when needed. Many jokes flew over me, since you have to be Spanish to get those, but I still loved the movie. Looking forward to the sequel.",1487808000,,435,5.055555555555555

Having learned Spanish in Spain and watching this again after considering myself now, bilingual, the subtitles are entertaining but much of the humor is lost in translation.
