8683308,4,B00ODQMELU,"First off, Amazon's description about this German disc says its a ""PAL/Region 0 DVD: it WILL NOT play on standard US DVD players. You need a multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player to view it in USA/Canada."" The case says its PAL Region 2 but the disc plays perfectly in my four-year-old US/NTSC/ Region 1 LG Blu-ray player. I'm assuming this happens because the disc is as advertised, actually a ""Region 0"" one which usually means its multi-regional so it should play anywhere. Will it play on any US player? I believe so, but US Buyers should Beware. Worst case scenario: I was prepared to play it on my PC or laptop that play discs from any country because I've been waiting for a long time to see this documentary since I first read about it. I could also connect my laptop to my TV to view the film on a bigger screen. The disc includes German and English subtitles. Theres also a booklet featuring an interview with the director, but its only in German.

VERBOTENE FILME (FORBIDDEN FILMS), a 2014 documentary by Felix Moeller, who made one about director Veit Harlan and wrote a book about Joseph Goebbels involvement in the film industry, focuses on German Nazi-era propaganda films that have banned for general showings in Germany and elsewhere. Of the almost 1200 films made during the Third Reich, 300 were banned after WWII and today only about 40 have restricted viewing. We get to see controversial clips from the most notorious ones such as 1940s anti-Semitic JUD SUSS and DIE ROTHCHILDS, 1941s anti-Polish HEIMKEHR (HOMECOMING), 1941s pro-euthanasia ICH KLAGE AN (I ACCUSE), 1941s anti-British OHM KRUGER (UNCLE KRUGER), and others. These films have been covered in a similar and good documentary from 1968 by Irwin Leiser, who wrote Nazi Cinema, called DEUTSCHLAND ERWACHE (GERMANY AWAKE!) that covers most of the same material, uses more films, and is worth owning if you don't want this new one that uses better quality clips. The narrator of DEUTSCHLAND ERWACHE places these films in their historical context unlike those presented in VERBOTENE FILME. Leisers documentary is a primer geared towards viewers unfamiliar with these films while Moeller spend more time on the above films and is concerned with current audience reactions. Actually, both documentaries complement each other and are worth owning separately but better viewed together.

Moeller's film mostly relies on film historians and young and old audience members in Germany, France, and Israel debating whether these films should still be seen today. Those individuals for and against their showing make persuasive arguments.  One point brought up is how neo-Nazis use these films to recruit members since many of these films are available online for free or can be easily purchased today. Another concern voiced is how uneducated people could accept these films that distort history as real depictions of past events and people. The editing out of pro-Nazi material to make these films accessible to a wider audience is also debated. We also hear the daughter of Wolfgang Liebeneiner who directed ICH KLAGE AN repeat her father's defense for making his film; she doesn't condone the film but explains his reasoning. We also hear Emil Jannings' nephew explaining how his uncle spent over 10 years wanting to make OHM KRUGER and later said Goebbels forced him to do it instead of blaming himself. The film should have been mentioned that it was Jannings enthusiastic involvement during the making and promotion of this anti-British opus that caused him to be permanently banned by the Allies from working in films after WWII. Moeller could have also mentioned how Werner Krauss was temporarily banned from performing on stage and screen in Germany after the war because of his playing several Jewish stereotypes in Harlans JUD SUSS and on stage, and how his career never fully recovered. Another documentary could be made about artists who stayed willingly during the Third Reich or were forced to work for the Nazis and if they were allowed to resume their professions after the war.

VERBOTENE FILME is a worthwhile documentary for anyone interested in Nazi film propaganda. I wish it was longer to include details about the films production and reception at the time of their release. That info is available in books, but it would have been nice to see some of that here and more films mentioned, but thats just me. That wasn't Moellers intent which is to show how the best-known films are perceived by current viewers and he more than meets his goal by recording their varied reactions.",1491004800,3,4567,4.989501312335958
