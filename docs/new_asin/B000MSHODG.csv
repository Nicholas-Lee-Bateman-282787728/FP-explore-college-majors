8171624,1,B000MSHODG,"This review is about the quality of the DVD from ""MR. FAT-W VIDEO,"" not the movie (which I couldn't even finish).  The movie was originally released in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but it has been cropped to 1.33:1 here, and it was done very, very poorly.  I wouldn't even call this ""pan and scan"" because that implies that some effort was made to show the important images.  Instead, it looks like they just took the center of the frame all the way through, so you get people talking while you can only see their nose or their shoulder or something because they're otherwise out of the frame.  Besides that, the image quality is just dreadful.  Avoid at all costs.",1441670400,3,659,4.504201680672269
8171625,5,B000MSHODG,"Entertainment from beginning to end. This foreign intrigue swindle is bursting with action aplenty. Bouchet, Rennie and Australia's Mike Preston display great dramatic performances in this gut-wrenching ordeal. Not to be missed!",1438732800,,228,6.15625
8171626,5,B000MSHODG,"I like the opening of this film because it is actor (my husband,) Gerald Hardig in the water, who blows up the ship. This is a hard to get video but worth the price.",1193875200,,165,3.8823529411764706
