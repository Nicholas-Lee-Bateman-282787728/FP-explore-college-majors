8477243,5,B005KSRHBW,Good documentary for those going through the loss of a loved one.  Features persons sharing about their losses and how their faith sustained them through the journey.,1511827200,,166,5.148148148148148
8477244,1,B005KSRHBW,"I thought this would reflect the wonderful writing style and the theological insights of C. S. Lewis, who was mentioned prominently on the DVD cover.  Instead, it was trite and flaccid, bearing no apparent brilliance of C. S. Lewis.  On the positive side, the DVD was in perfect condition.",1492128000,,289,4.877551020408164
8477245,5,B005KSRHBW,"This is such a great DVD to have in your movie collection.  Everyone goes through times of sorrow and grief.  I bought more than one to be able to give to a suffering soul who has lost something in their life. It could be a loved one, a physical problem, a job, a home.  I highly recommend it.",1427328000,2,293,4.017241379310345
8477246,3,B005KSRHBW,"This is a DVD presentation on some of CS Lewis' thoughts on grief and loss. For some bereaved person who is totally mystified by the experience, it could work, as various persons talk about their own experiences of loss in the video. Personally I prefer the writings.",1379721600,3,267,4.702127659574468
8477247,5,B005KSRHBW,"Just watched this last night.  I've  been intrigued with CS Lewis and his relationship with Joy Gresham ever since I first read about it. his book, A Grief Observed talking about the grieving process after her death  has come up in conversations  multiple times  over the years, so I was looking forward to watching this DVD.  If you're close to someone going through the grieving process, this will enable you to be a much wiser and more effective comfort to them than otherwise...especially if you yourself have yet to loose someone really close",1359331200,9,547,4.827956989247312
