3892486,5,B002AT4LUO,"""Simple Living,"" graciously hosted by Wanda Urbanska, presents five episodes of the popular public television series designed to teach the viewer about ways for more conscientious and sustainable living. A great watch!",1359590400,3,218,5.84375
3892487,5,B002AT4LUO,Thrilled to see this wonderful series available!,1487980800,,48,6.0
3892488,5,B002AT4LUO,"Wanda Urbanska drove a Conestoga filled with practical ideas across an arid landscape when her marvelous show ""Simple Living"" first entered American living rooms.  She was among the very first to make the case that each of us had to reduce our footprint to have any hope of restoring the planet to healthy balance.  Skillful writer/producers like Urbanska pushed us all toward a new, and more responsible, way to live. The recent fissure in Antarctica points clearly to a planet still in peril and to the urgency of the challenge she helped define.  Her Simple Living series still offers an inspirational, yet realistic, guide to responsible consumption.",1487980800,6,654,5.093457943925234
3892489,5,B002AT4LUO,Very knowledgable host...she's worth watching!,1487980800,2,46,8.4
3892490,5,B002AT4LUO,"Interesting and useful information and everyday ideas to use less energy, create less waste, and live in a way that honors and respects the limited resources we have. If we all took some of these ""simple"" steps in our day to day life, it would make an enormous impact.",1487980800,2,268,4.489795918367347
3892491,5,B002AT4LUO,Very inspiring.,1487980800,2,15,7.0
3892492,5,B002AT4LUO,"I have personally witnessed and participated in the widespread popularity of this important series. At a time when our collision course with nature is obvious and life is a hectic rat race, Wanda Urbanska gives you daily brilliance and inspiration.",1487980800,2,248,5.225
3892493,5,B002AT4LUO,"I saw most of these shows when they were on PBS, and every one of them is helpful and gives lots of great information about different aspects of simplifying your life. Highly recommend!",1487894400,,185,4.636363636363637
3892494,5,B002AT4LUO,"A wonderful series, packed with inspiring stories about how to simplify your life, protect the environment and build local communities.  From the author of SIMPLE LIVING and MOVING TO A SMALL TOWN and the host of the PBS documentary ESCAPE FROM ESCAPE FROM AFFLUENZA.  Very worth watching!",1487894400,4,289,5.127659574468085
3892495,2,B002AT4LUO,"The movie was well meaning, but much of it came across as government regulators forcing cities and communities to go ""green"" at the expense of the hardworking taxpayers.  Goodbye freedom.  What ever happened to the idea of just being thrifty?  Perhaps many government agencies should practice that when using other people's money.  Slave labor is alive and well, it's called non-profits and volunteerism.  There is good money in non-profits.  Ask those that run them!",1437004800,,467,5.243243243243243
3892496,1,B002AT4LUO,"Couldn't watch it, just another liberal environmentalist.  Is there any other kind on PBS?  Video barely begins before she starts talking about rising sea levels from global warming harming San Diego.  She lost all credibility with that statement.",1432684800,3,247,5.447368421052632
3892497,1,B002AT4LUO,Out of date. I already knew all this,1427328000,,36,3.625

3892499,2,B002AT4LUO,Old.  Low budget.  Boring.,1424476800,,26,5.25
3892500,1,B002AT4LUO,intro was so boring - too much explaining what the show was going to tell us without actually teaching anything - I had to turn if off 10 min in.  Get to the point faster.,1424390400,,171,3.8857142857142857
3892501,1,B002AT4LUO,Boring. I should have read the reviews first. I could only take 10 minutes of it.,1418428800,,81,4.125
3892502,2,B002AT4LUO,"I see a strong connection between being more green and living simply/frugally so what some other reviewers complained about didn't deter me from checking this out, in fact, it piqued my interest.  But seeing in the opening credits that this program was sponsored by a polyurethane company was a total turn off.  It kept nagging at me so much that I stopped watching after a few minutes.  Too hypocritical for my taste :(",1414627200,,420,4.726027397260274
3892503,5,B002AT4LUO,I like it a lot. I dsw it as wakeup call.,1411603200,,41,2.8181818181818183
3892504,3,B002AT4LUO,OK,1409616000,,2,2.0
3892505,4,B002AT4LUO,"This was not a perfect episode, but very helpful and Americans could stand to change their minds on many of the practical examples offered here. I do not agree with the whole idea of ""global warming"" and don't like the idea of cities, but we currently are stuck in the city and practice many of the things talked about in this short film. There truly are a lot of little things that we can change about our lifestyles, and they are not difficult at all. We have found that our 9 person family can live off a very limited income because we live a simple lifestyle.",1409184000,,563,4.320754716981132
3892506,3,B002AT4LUO,Interesting but nothing earthshaking presented. Good to see how everyone can help a little,1407888000,,90,5.5
3892507,1,B002AT4LUO,"She mentioned the seas rising due to ""global warming"" three minutes into the program,...I turned it off.  It was poorly rated and I should have known better.",1402617600,,157,4.814814814814815
3892508,1,B002AT4LUO,"It wasn't so much about simple living as much as it was about green living. Not what I expected, I felt the host talked to the audience as if we didn't speak English, got boring quickly.",1394323200,3,186,4.194444444444445
3892509,5,B002AT4LUO,great advice for urban dwellers. please watch and spread the word. this needs to happen everywhere. great suggestions. loved it.,1393200000,,128,5.45
3892510,5,B002AT4LUO,"She is helpful, inspiring, and the program was fun to watch.  I wish there were more of them with more tips and tricks.",1392249600,,119,4.173913043478261
3892511,1,B002AT4LUO,"I was really disappointed, I'm interested in being green, eating clean, and downsizing/rightsizing. This didn't touch on anything other than Chicago constructing green buildings, green garden roofs, and parks. It's all about Chicago city living and being greener.",1391472000,6,263,5.947368421052632
3892512,1,B002AT4LUO,"There was plenty of preaching about global warming and living simply to ""save the planet"" but little of use or interesting.",1390867200,,123,4.904761904761905
3892513,1,B002AT4LUO,Didn't finish watching this.  It was very dull.  She was only talking about what some of the cities were doing (back in 2006 or 2007) to be green.,1389052800,2,146,4.178571428571429
3892514,2,B002AT4LUO,Very nice look at simple living but wasn't memorable to me.  I think I need to watch it again.  I was watching a lot of documentaries the day I watched this so nothing stands out.,1384646400,,179,4.085714285714285
3892515,3,B002AT4LUO,It wasn't exactly what I expected.  I expected to hear about how to live simply but it wasn't like that.  I might try to watch it again at some point.,1379030400,,150,3.966666666666667
3892516,2,B002AT4LUO,"Commercialism confuses simplicity.

I wasn't very inspired by the show or it's content.  In fact, it reminds me of all the 'Farm-to-table' efforts around town that welcome welfare recipients to their establishments by offering 50% discounts on food items.  So why aren't those people there?  Because they are almost always located in places where those people are not welcomed or 'belong'.  There seemed to be a similar correlation in this video.

Matters discussed in the video:

This video focuses much more on alternative 'green' solutions, but they aren't necessarily simpler. There's very little, if anything, SIMPLE about what has become a conventional flush toilet.

Yes, simple is choosing cloth napkins and diapers over paper.  However, in reality, handwashing is simpler than machine washing.  Electricity in the home is not essential.  And forgoing it is infinitely simpler than even solar panels.  What's NOT simple is Commercialism.  And much of what's portrayed here is mostly a part of it: Middle-class people, with middle-class university degrees taking a middle-class approach to economic self preservation.

Logically, simpler should also be more affordable and more available, but it's not. I think that part of the message did come across in the video.

In a practical sense, so much of what is covered here, seemed to be class-based.  For example, she suggested using a public library, not just reduce the need to buy books (economy and recycling), but to meet people. SO much of the video is with reference to a mega-urban environment, so I'll stick to that demographic.  Public libraries in large, urban areas are often associated with masses of folks (many smelly, lurking types) almost exclusively interested in free internet,computer, radio and television use. None of those activities are particularly geared to interact with others and the patrons reflect this attitude.  Conversely, (outside of the main branch) in more affluent areas of any city or suburb is where most of public library programming that lends itself to the more popular social activities/guest lectures along with an environment more conducive to relaxed exploration takes place.",1368230400,11,2177,5.352941176470588
8360371,5,B002AT4LUO,This book is very helpful.  There are always ways to improve you home life but some do not know how to start.  This book helps with some guidance to improve your home life.  Wanda has a great perspective of how to start and maintain a well-balanced life.,1495497600,,254,4.361702127659575
8360372,5,B002AT4LUO,"This is a great series for taking a look at what you can do to simplify or downsize your life or ""footprint"" in the world.
You should be able to find some useful tips to implement in your everyday life to save money, time or waste.
I find the negative reviews hilarious, From out of touch or outdated to the ridiculous ""Government Overreach?"".
Some people just need to complain to feel good about themselves.",1489449600,,408,4.527027027027027
8360373,5,B002AT4LUO,Excellent!,1488844800,,10,10.0
8360374,5,B002AT4LUO,"I know Wanda personally and have seen her in action:  She is passionate about living simply and doing what's right for the environment, and she presents herself in a highly accessible, ""down to earth"" manner.  I highly recommend her show and her book on the same topic.",1488844800,,269,4.702127659574468
8360375,5,B002AT4LUO,"Wanda Urbanska's TV series is as practical and brilliant as her on the same topic have been.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wanda-Urbanska/dp/B0036CSJ5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wanda Urbanska</a>

Hers was one of the first voices for simplifying back in 1992, and her message has only become more compelling over time. She has ""walked the walk,"" too - moving from busy Los Angeles to a small town on the Virginia / North Carolina border.

The TV series is both informal and informative, full of anecdotal experience from her own life, and she shares it all with a charm and grace that conveys beautifully throughout.",1488758400,2,658,5.77319587628866
8360376,5,B002AT4LUO,"The road to a simpler, more sustainable life is through everyday habits that add up to a new outlook on life. That is, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, remembering to bring your reusable bags into the grocery store, taking the trouble to compost organic waste rather than toss in the garbage. Wanda Urbanska's series reminds us of all these small actions -- her mantra is ""nothing's too small to make a difference"" -- and the philosophy behind living simply, with greater connection to the world, the ecosystem and the people around us. This gentle series is a call to another world: one not running on greed, but rather on gratitude, kindness and the sense that we are here to serve each other.",1488758400,,705,4.693548387096774
8360377,5,B002AT4LUO,Wanda creates an interesting alternative to modern living.  Some thoughts will not appeal to all but does give a guide to what green options are possible.,1488240000,,154,4.923076923076923
8360378,4,B002AT4LUO,"Ms. Urbanska's message couldn't be more timely and on-point. We are living in a world of reality deniers and selfish egoists who have little concern for their neighbors or for the fragile world where we live. The author focuses on practical, step-by-step recommendations on how we might get our own lives in order while contributing to the common good of the world around us. Especially helpful was her  section on ""De-cluttering""  which prompted my several trips to Goodwill and Salvation Army. That section alone was worth the price of the book.",1488240000,,547,5.0
8360379,5,B002AT4LUO,"Its really interesting to see what was cutting edge a decade ago is still relevant for the global population. It is the simple things that we all need to do- take personal action and to be accountable for walking, biking, recycling, not wasting water or further contaminating our water with disposal use but compost instead, as simple examples. Collectively we can make a difference. Its pretty amazing that what some people think is boring or ""old"" , they may not be doing a lot of these very simple actions that we can each take, and to also teach our kids so that we can all contribute to a more sustainable, simplistic lifestyle. Thank you Wanda, for your warm and conversational delivery of such an important message and reminder for us all to slow down, take responsibility. It is amazing but true- you really do end up with more time and fewer bills!",1488067200,2,857,4.644736842105263
8360380,5,B002AT4LUO,"Loved this series!  New episodes must have been recently released.  Although it seems like it was produced a few years back, the information provided by Wanda is still relevant and very interesting to learn.  It is a nicely flowing and easy to watch series.  Looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes.  So happy this is all available on amazon prime now.  I plan on showing many of the episodes if not all to my children so I can instill a sense of environmentalism in them at an early age.",1488067200,4,501,4.450549450549451
