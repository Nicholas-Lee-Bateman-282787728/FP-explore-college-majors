8607484,5,B00A7ID750,"This DVD is a great tool and a visual example of caring for your horse trailer. Along with the book, The Horse Trailer Owner's Manual, I would recommend this set as good investment for trailer owners. It's easy to understand and does a good job of breaking down the components and the ""why"" behind trailer maintenance. This DVD will more than pay for itself in saving lives of both the horses and their owners. I highly recommend. We've needed something like this for a very long time!",1384732800,,485,4.586206896551724
