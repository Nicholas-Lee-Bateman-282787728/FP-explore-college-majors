8358742,1,B0029Z8KAQ,Lower than expectation. Season 1 was good but this season 2 is sucks not worth to buy. Waiting season 3 to be released.,1382745600,,119,4.217391304347826
8358743,3,B0029Z8KAQ,"After watching the first season of ""Foursome"", I couldn't wait to see what the next season had to offer. While there is still a nice level of sexiness throughout, it seemed a little more censored this time around.

Hopefully, the third season will be better.",1256688000,5,258,4.733333333333333
8358744,2,B0029Z8KAQ,"I bought the first season and was very pleased with it. And when the second season came out, I just bought it without hesitation. What a rip-off this is. Couldn't imagine that playboy would let such ludicrous censorship ruin all the fun customers should have had from this series!!!! All the good stuff was gone, some were blurred, parts were cut out... Things looked very hurried and incoherent. I will only buy the third season only after I can ascertain that they won't butcher their materials again. Very disappointed!!!!",1254441600,5,525,4.910112359550562
8358745,3,B0029Z8KAQ,"After buying the first season of Playboy's Foursome, I was much anticipating this second season to be as good and exciting as the first, but all I saw was an edited and censored version of the original show that was aired on the Playboy channel. Shower scenes, bedroom scenes, and sex scenes were all edited and some scenes even had mosaics to censor specific body parts. If there is a season 3 DVD, I would now definitely think twice about purchasing the third installment of the show.",1253664000,8,486,4.597701149425287
