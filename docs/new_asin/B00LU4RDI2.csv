8668194,5,B00LU4RDI2,"This documentary explains the theory behind corporatism or cronyism. There are lots of examples of small producers getting crushed by regulations - raw milk is the best example. The FDA is thoroughly corrupt - lot's of big corporation CEO's either work for the FDA or have good connections.

It turns out that a lot of people who have worked for the government have worked for big corporations (and vice versa). It's a deadly collusion that will make the country less free. For example, Michael Chertoff works for the government and for the corporation that produces scanners for the TSA.

Big corporations lobby and donate money to politicians so that they can pass laws banning raw milk. Raw milk has been used since the beginning of time. All of a sudden, it is considered unhealthy. The truth is that big dairy corporations push for pasteurized milk because it lasts longer than raw milk.

The only thing I didn't like about this documentary is its advocacy for marijuana. While the laws against marijuana are too strict, Colorado has seen more marijuana use, more health issues and more car accidents after legalization. Marijuana is a drug, it changes one's consciousness while tobacco doesn't. I mean, would you rather give your pilot a joint or a martini?",1443225600,3,1263,4.92018779342723

8668198,5,B00LU4RDI2,"Freedom From Choice is a documentary covering all the subjects people don't want to hear about because, ""ignorance is bliss"" and anyway why take all the fun out of pretending you actually are living in a democracy? This docudrama is extremely well done and covers so much ground in such a short time. Maybe if enough of our citizens see this we can have an ""awakening"" or, maybe not.",1416614400,8,383,4.565217391304348
