3159079,3,B0016MJ6II,"I actually kinda sorta liked this one.
Of course STEEL TRAP is no new classic or anything.
It's SAW, without the gore and shoddy directing.
It makes a bit of a mockery
with statements like
I want to play a game...
or
Your mission, if you choose to accept it...

It's a slasher/scavenger hunt for teens
(and immature adults who love horror).

A group of party-goers receive text message invites to an after-hours party.  Not being the most pragmatic of folks, these idiots stroll on down to an abandoned floor in the building.  Let the games begin...

They have to solve stupid puzzles, decipher riddles, etc...
The characters are all pretty annoying.
There is sex talk with no sex.
Sarcasm without any intellect.
Plus a lame killer as menacing looking as an S&M version of Pee Wee Herman.

FINAL GRADE--2.5 STARS
A step down for Dimension Extreme.
A step up from most After Dark Horror Fest.
Better than the latest cruddy SAW sequels it's imitating too.",1240617600,,953,4.710843373493976
3159080,1,B0016MJ6II,"Maybe they should have called this thing ""Drywall Trap"" or ""Office Space Trap"", because there really isn't a whole lot of ""Steel"" visible during the flick...maybe the elevator doors??

I really did like the premise of this film. You get nine almost-strangers trapped on the 27th floor of a deserted high rise being hunted down one-by-one by a masked killer. As a huge fan of slasher flicks, that is all I needed to give this one a shot. Unfortunately, there are quite a few things missing that would have made the film enjoyable:
1. - Likable Characters. Okay, so when you make a slasher flick, you always need someone to play the jerk, just so you can enjoy watching them get hacked to pieces. Well, with ""Steel Trap"" all you have are unlikable idiots that no one could possibly relate too. With so many unlikable characters, you truly don't care who wins, loses, lives or dies. You just want it over with.
2. - A Menacing Killer. The photos on the DVD of the masked killer look pretty creepy...and that is as close to scary as it gets with the movie. In action this masked dork doesn't really inspire fright so much as bemusement.
3. - Creepy Setting. If all else fails, put your protagonists in a creepy environment that can be fun to look at. Watching someone run past the copier room in what looks like an insurance agency office is just plain dull.
4. - Have some Gore. For a DVD from ""Dimension Extreme"" you would hope a little red stuff would spill from time to time. Even a low-grade horror flick can at least pump out some grue to enliven things, but any red stuff spilled here is strictly in the ""Rated PG"" range.

The cover of the DVD looks awesome, the story sounds compelling, but trust me, the only thing resembling a ""trap"" is the marketing done for this film. I sprung it, and was trapped into wasting 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Avoid this one big time.",1236556800,16,1886,4.4479768786127165

3159082,3,B0016MJ6II,"I didn't dislike this film. It wasn't the greatest of horror/gore, but it was worthwhile.

These folks at a New Year's Eve party on the roof of a building are invited, by way of text-message, to a better party on the 27th floor. There's only a few of them, though; all of them are apparently there for a reason. Their place-setting cards explain one is 'pig'; another, 'heartless'; etc. Of course, you'd think they'd get out of there after being insulted that way and finding nobody else; not much a celebration.

They are presented with variations on nursery rhymes and, at first, believe it is some sort of treasure-hunt; but when they want to leave, they are barricaded in certain ways and cell phones don't work...even the fire alarm doesn't (one of 'em pulls the lever and childish music plays).

Whoever behind it is f'in with 'em and playing mind games. As for me, I thought the ending was pretty-cool and I didn't expect it. The lady acting at the end seemed to do a better job there & it was neat/spooky.

In fact, the thing I didn't like about this movie the most was when a woman passes out and began to have a seizure. Another person states for someone to get her a spoon to put in the mouth of the woman to prevent her from swallowing her tongue. Afterward, the person is able to talk fine and get up immediately, which is pretty silly.

Even in these 'enlightened' days, that ridiculous idea is still believed and it annoyed me; never do such a thing. Prying open a person jaws can dislocate 'em (it's happened to me); and, of course, you can't swallow the tongue since it's attached.

I can look past the bad acting, its par for the course, but let me tell you something, I don't think Steel Trap has any excuse in being the abomination that it is. This movie obviously had some kind of budget, and apparently blew it on the most annoying ""actors"" they could find. Take drag queen Nicole for instance, never have I been so annoyed by someone in my entire life, her voice alone killed this movie. But I can not place all the blame on the disturbingly wooden cast, because let me tell you, whoever wrote this trash has penned quite possibly the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a movie. So maybe the bad acting wasn't their fault, maybe they were just flabbergasted at the lines they had to spew out. No, it was both. There is nothing original here either, it kind of sounded like it would be a cross between Cube and Saw, nice. But no, it wasn't. It was just a slasher movie with sparsely laid traps. Ooo, the elevator doors have teeth now! Lame. But why would we watch a movie like this? Gore, death, and all that good stuff. Well, the violence is very tame, minimal gore, off camera kills, just done to annoy us further. And then comes the extremely predictable outcome, I will not spoil things for you, heh. I actually found nothing redeeming in this movie, nothing. That's really hard for me to say. I can usually find something worthwhile in anything I watch, but here I draw a blank.

8263142,1,B0016MJ6II,"Like most horror flicks, Steel Trap begins with several hapless individuals who are trapped in an enclosed space by a deranged psychopath. Either they escape, or they fail (resulting in gruesome and sometimes entertaining demises).

Steel Trap has none of the elements that make horror films compelling. The characters are boring and hardly given more than a few minutes to explain their backstory. In this case, it was worse than having no backstory and simply having the characters beheaded, impaled, disemboweled or some other variant. The victims are so dull and flat that more screentime devoted to tension and mood would have done the film wonders. As far as the deaths go, there is no creativity present. Some ""traps"" are done better at your average high school haunted house.

I do give the creators credit for wrapping everything up nicely with plausible explanations, but that in no way compensates for the atrocious (and ultimately ineffective) attempts to scare the viewer. The characters are so dumb and their behaviour so unbelievable that suspension of disbelief is not really an option. They quickly discover the elephantine contrast between the killer's strength and resourcefulness and their own. Not two minutes later, one of them is isolated. Cue the ""suspenseful music"" and denouement that even a horror greenhorn could see coming, and you have a recipe for boredom and (hopefully) box office and DVD sale impotence.",1365292800,,1437,5.189655172413793
8263143,4,B0016MJ6II,"Shocking.  After reading the reviews on here from other customers, I did not have high hopes while sliding the Steel Trap DVD in. I was expecting something like a really cheap mash up of Saw and Cube, with the inevitable horrible acting that goes along with most ill-reviewed horror movies. But I was actually pleasantly surprised at the end of Steel Trap.  It not only held my attention, but I even enjoyed the ending.  The acting was pretty decent, and the budget appeared to be a lot larger than what I was predicting. Okay, so this movie doesn't hit you with anything new.  There's nothing stellar about it. But when your horror movie choices nowadays are torture porn or boring ""thrillers"", it's nice to see one that's about nothing but pure revenge. There were lots of the holes in the plot (how did 3 people go to the same school and not recognize each other? How could people rig up such a large building like this?), and I also wish they would have drawn out the treasure hunt / riddles a bit longer instead of stopping so soon, but overall it was a cheap thrill that I really enjoyed.",1362873600,,1094,4.482412060301508

When they all get there there is also two party chrashers with them. They soon find clues and the game begins with a mysterious killer picking them off one by one. Beyond that the only thing I will say about the story is that there is a twist at the end.

To me this movie isn't bad even though it has a saw vibe. ( pig heads and some traps).  My biggest complaint is the actiing is bad. Other than that this is a good movie although I have mixed feelings about the ending.",1277337600,,661,4.076923076923077
8263145,2,B0016MJ6II,"That's an actual quote from one of the characters in this sorry excuse for a horror film. It's also the only thing in the script I found smart. 'Steel Trap' has all the makings for a decent horror film: an interesting premise, a spooky set,  unlikable characters and wonderfully campy dialogue, but instead the filmmakers throw it all out in favor of making yet another torture porn movie.

It's New Year's Eve. While the party rages downstairs, six strangers each receive a mysterious e-mail inviting them to a more exclusive party being held on the top floor of an abandoned high rise. The guest list includes a rock star, a celebrity chef, a TV executive, an advice columnist and her boyfriend. There are also a couple of party crashers. When the guests arrive at the top floor they're greeted by ominous music and a severed pig's head. Alarmed but undeterred, they venture onwards where they discover personalized name tags that not only bear their names but also their biggest character flaws. As the six sit around taking swigs from a champagne bottle and snorting coke, they try to figure out who their host is and how that person knows so much about their personal lives. Instead of finding the answers they seek, they find a map  which leads them on a scavenger hunt for clues. Since they're a little tipsy and a bit stoned they think it's a good idea to break off into groups and explore the dark hallways and locked rooms of an abandoned high rise. Needless to say, with the group splintered every which way, the guests start getting picked off one by one. What at first seemed like a disparate group of strangers turns out to be a group of people with more in common than they think. Each one did something horrible in the mind of their unseen host who sees fit to get revenge on them in the most gruesome ways imaginable. It also goes without saying that one of the guests learns of this horrible plan before getting captured by the bad guy who then goes into great detail explaining how his pent up pain has led to this, confirming everything that person, and us, knows by now.

The film sucks. The cast is full of unknowns, it's not scary but extremely dull, gory as hell and the ending is so stupid not only in theory but in execution. Except for some wonderfully campy dialogue there's no escape from this 'Steel Trap' of stupidity.",1276473600,3,2349,4.572446555819478
