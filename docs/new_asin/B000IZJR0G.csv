2664334,5,B000IZJR0G,"I had ordered this movie on Blockbuster Online quite sometime ago and forgotten about it. It finnally showed up yesterday and of course I watched it........ then promptly logged on to Amazon.com and bought it as well as the CD (Sound track!)

For pure entertainment this is a FUN! film that I will watch many times over.

As to the music, I usually really like one or two of the musical numbers, like 2~3 and oh -hum on the rest....In this film they are all good!

There is another similar film staring SRK, that has a a bit darker theme to it, involing identical persons, that is a decent film, but not as fun as Duplicate!

Oh yeah, keep your eyes open for Kajol. According to the end credits, she is in this film somewhere (although I did not realize that till I saw her name in the credits.) So I have to go watch again just to find her..oh well :) !",1220227200,13,854,4.220858895705521
2664335,5,B000IZJR0G,"I just love Shahrukh Khan!!!!  He is the best actor.  Duplicate is a very good movie-it has everything,action, some comedy, drama, romance.  Shahrukh Khan plays a great reporter that has a rivalry woman reporter who eventually become close.  The assignment they both have-they work for different news companies- has to do with politics and the execution of a man that may be innocent,  Very good movie,I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1180396800,4,441,5.069444444444445
2664336,5,B000IZJR0G,"This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies I've seen to date, and I've seen a lot! I was hooked from the first scene. The dialog is hilarious! If you don't like Shahrukh Khan's silly antics and over-the-top acting, then this won't be for you. But if you're like me, those are the very things that make the film! I love Bablu's cute innocence and Manu's sly trickery. I'm a big SRK fan, but I especially enjoy his doppelganger films like this one, Don, and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. In general, I prefer the soundtracks of more recent Bollywood movies, but there was at least one really catchy song in this one. If you like goofy, zany movies, I highly recommend Duplicate!",1418774400,,668,4.439024390243903

2664338,4,B000IZJR0G,this is set up to be funny but it missed the mark. the bad guy was not bad enough and the good guy was an idiot.  this was silly and not funny. Buy another film.,1400803200,,161,3.6
2664339,1,B000IZJR0G,I purchased a DVD in US from this seller and they sent me a DVD that does not work! I was a foreign DVD for use in foreign country not US!

2664344,5,B000IZJR0G,"I loved this film!!! It was fun to see the contrast between Bablu Chaudhry and Manu Dada, both played by Shah Rukh Khan. He did fantastic in his roles. I loved seeing Juhi Chawla in this film, too. I loved the music, dancing, humor, thrills and twists to the story! It's a fun, fun, film to watch!!!",1335312000,2,299,4.2631578947368425
2664345,4,B000IZJR0G,"I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing one of the songs on youtube called Ladna Jhagadna; it's adorable. But my movie's songs didn't have English subtitles. Watching it the 1st time was like missing half the movie without knowing what the songs meant. Thankfully, KingKhan on youtube posted the songs with subtitles, so I was able to complete the total movie picture. The movie itself is very cute; Shah Rukh Khan does this one scene as his evil self that is jawdropping; I couldn't believe he would do it; you'll know it when you see 9 1/2 wks playing in the background. HELLO! I was shrieking in delighted horror. The ending was not as satisfying as I could have wished, but it was still a good movie.",1330560000,5,720,4.546153846153846
