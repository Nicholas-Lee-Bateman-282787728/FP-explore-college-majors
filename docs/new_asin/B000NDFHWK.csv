2765063,5,B000NDFHWK,This is the only video that make me sweat like CRAZY!  I saw results very quickly.  It works your legs but also your butt and your arms.  I love it!,1181260800,13,148,3.8666666666666667
2765064,5,B000NDFHWK,"I just finished using this DVD for the first time and can honestly say this workout is terrific.  I am very particular about which workout DVD's I use, unfortunately I have had a tendency of purchasing more than I really need, not enjoying them and then having to go through the trouble of selling them.  I purchased this one simply based on the first review being positive and the fact that Violet Zaki is the instructor (her other fitness DVD's are great).  I am very happy I did.

The length of the workout in total is 55 minutes, which is longer than I typically like for a DVD workout but can assure you the time is used wisely.  I must warn you, though, there are a lot of reps and lunges, so if you are not a fan of either of those two things then this workout is not for you.  However, the outdoor scenery is spectacular and Zaki's instruction is soothing instead of the typical ""you can do it"" cheesiness I find on many workouts, both of which help the time fly by.  And her body is unreal!  I hope that she is right in saying that I will see changes if I do this consistently for four weeks.  If I can look even half as good and healthy as she does, then I am all about it!",1179619200,14,1183,4.131004366812227
2765065,5,B000NDFHWK,"I really love this workout.  It doesn't let up from start to end and it uses every kind of move you can think of to get great shape to your legs.  There are moves lying down and standing up, with weights and without, pulsing, shorter moves; you name it - the move is here.  Violet Zaki even does exercises for developing balance skills.  She is a motivating instructor who has done other Self dvds.  She cues well which I like because you know what to do and when to do it.  She is outgoing without being overly so.

The other great thing about the dvd is the 'set'.  It's outdoors (like some of their other workouts) and that is motivating in itself because it's sunny even if where you are is cold or wet.  This will really challenge you and your muscles will be sore the next day or two.  I believe it's worth it though because even though I've only done this three times, I feel as if I see a little more definition.  It's great and I think it can deliver what the title promises.",1178755200,22,984,4.208556149732621
2765071,5,B000NDFHWK,"I love instructor Violet Zaki, she is really one big profesionalist. I like her workouts. She knows what she teach us and what's really great it helps.",1222732800,,151,4.62962962962963
2765072,5,B000NDFHWK,"The good kind of pain I mean, in all the right places, and feels that muscles have been working.  I have been a pilates and yoga devotee for a while now, my complaint about those styles, that is mostly core, yes, but overlooks legs...  This one had my heart pumping and sweat beading, and went so fast that I even didn't notice that it was over, and it was FUN!  Balancing is taking some time getting used to, but not terribly hard to do, as said afraid of the heat stay out of the kitchen.  Recommend this DVD.",1203292800,2,511,4.183673469387755
2765073,4,B000NDFHWK,"This was a good intermediate workout, my only problem with it was that it required a lot of balance, and it wasn't quite hard enough for me. I thought that 51 minutes was just about right though. I also liked that the exercises were new variations on some old ones, so it kept me interested. The video was broken into 6 sections:
  Warm-up
  Legs without weights
  Cardio
  Legs and arms with weights
  Floorwork
  Cool down

The only equipment needed were a mat for floorwork, and 2-3 lb. weights. I would recommend this workout to anyone who is at a beginner to intermediate level. I wouldn't recommend this video to those who have problems with balance, it might be too frustrating.",1198886400,13,685,4.608333333333333
2765074,4,B000NDFHWK,"I just tried this workout DVD and boy, it did make my legs put some extra effort in it. Despite the fact that I attend high intensity spinning at least 3 times a week at the gym, my legs did go a bit shaky towards the end of the reps and I did feel the muscles working hard. Some of the moves were high impact on the knees (for example, squat jumps with heel clicks which was rather quick) but you can always opt to do it in a lower intensity way ie. normal squats. It did work out a great deal of sweat and cardio-wise, it was good. Breakdown of the workout: 5 mins of warmup, 10 mins of leg toning, 20 mins of cardio, 10 mins of lightweights thrown in for shoulders and arms, 1o mins of floor and 5 mins of cooldown/stretches - some yoga poses here(with a short stretch in between of toning and cardio). Not much cueing was given but the moves were easy to catch up on. Seeing her also kept me motivated. A guy friend did comment it was pretty boring but most guys will say that. I'll stick to it for a bit now and see what effects it'll give me. I'm pretty confident results will show. Good luck to the rest of you!",1197590400,6,1118,4.04054054054054
2765075,5,B000NDFHWK,"Violet Zaki does it again- she's such a great instructor- one of my favorites- and this video is just as great as her others. I hope Self keeps making these videos with Violet. She has consistancy, great counting and motivation without being annoying, and creates great combinations to really work you hard. good music, lovely background and a great routine and instructor- what more could you want?",1196121600,3,399,4.970149253731344
2765076,2,B000NDFHWK,"Although this workout has a great outdoor setting, it was far from being one of my favorite workouts. The instructor wasn't very likeable and the workout wasn't very intense. It includes a lot of moves requiring you to do a significant amount of balancing (The instructor, in fact, keeps bringing this to your attention throughout the workout - telling you that if you lose your balance to keep trying it. Unfortunately, if you frequently lose your balance, you also lose the benefit of the exercise.) I made through about 25-30 minute of this dvd and then gave up on it. The next day I didn't even feel anything from it, whereas just 10 minutes of some of ""the 10 minutes solution"" segments were far more effective. I'd recommend one of those instead.",1191801600,8,752,4.704545454545454
2765077,2,B000NDFHWK,"I ordered this after reading the great reviews and also because I wanted something specifically to work my legs. Unfortunately, I found it quite boring. Though lots of repititions can be key to success with working the legs, I have done other with a few less repititions and significantly more of a burn. Did end up sweating a bit and the instructor is pretty cute with her Australian accent, but my favorite strength and cardio workout video remains Cindy Crawford's Next Challenge Workout.",1186963200,2,491,4.927710843373494
2765078,5,B000NDFHWK,"If you can do squats and lunges, this is the workout for you. I have issues with my knees but when they don't bother me, doing this workout makes you sweat. If you're advanced, you'll still love it because it's a great cardio workout too.",1186358400,4,238,4.311111111111111
2765079,5,B000NDFHWK,"I bought this dvd because I have thoroughly enjoyed Violet's workouts on Comcast on Demand.  This one really put me to the test.  I have been working out for a while - mostly Pilates and some weights but needed to step up my game.  Well, I found it in this dvd.  This is one of my three favorite exercise dvd's - the others being Mina Lessig, Tank Top Arms . . . and Pilates Sculpt with Tracy Work and partner.  Once in a while I drag out Winsor Pilates Bun and Thigh Sculpt when I really don't feel like exercising.",1185580800,3,516,4.12
2765080,5,B000NDFHWK,"I tend to buy exercise DVDs based on totally exaggerated expectations and ""blurred"" reality and am quickly disappointed......until now!

I found this DVD accidentally and have to admit it's one of THE best cardio/leg DVDs I have ever done! I continue to feel motivated and each time I can push myself a little longer.  Violet does an excellent job at stressing quality over quantity...going slower and doing the movements deliberately provides better results than quickly going through the motions just to get them over with.  You also decrease the incidence of injury and strain by concentrating on each movement.

Another 'bonus' is that Violet incorporates a few minutes of stretching after strenuous reps which I find REALLY helps w/recovery.  I don't feel like my muscles are going to cramp in the evening after the workout. I feel that I am not only developing stronger and toned legs and glutes, but leaner, limber muscles as well.

I have been doing Winsor pilates advanced up until now and really didn't feel challenged. I certainly do now!  Now I just supplement with Winsor on days that I want to give myself a break.

I look forward to doing this DVD! It's actually fun!",1182729600,25,1182,4.875
8176993,5,B000NDFHWK,Best DVD out there for legs. It doesn't have to be high impact-- great to elevate the heart rate a little bit and tone,1457654400,,118,3.9583333333333335
8176994,5,B000NDFHWK,"Holy cow!  Strap in, you're about to get a workout!  And that's a good thing, you're not wasting your time with this one.  You gotta love Violet Zaki.",1426032000,,150,4.285714285714286
8176995,5,B000NDFHWK,"I've had this DVD for several years, and it has remained of my favorites.  I feel it's something of an accomplishment for a DVD to standout against the backdrop of my modestly large collection (hovering around 400 dvds--I know there are ladies with much larger collections, but mine is certainly respectable).  I LOVE this one.  It's my favorite workout from the Self collection (although, I do think almost the whole collection is solid--though the dance one is completely lackluster), and it is also my favorite workout by Violet Zaki.

Well segmented, and the short weighted section is my favorite (although the unweighted strength section is a close second).  The cardio section is short but tough---esp if you follow violet in all the high impact moves.  She does provide a modifier.  There's a small floor section at the end (it has a lot of bridge work).

Violet cues superbly, and I love the sunny outdoor set (I think the outdoor sets are one of my favorite things about this series).  The moves are athletic but creative, and I love the heavy use of multilimb movements (I have a particular love for balance work).

It's fun but leaves me feeling strong.  It challenges me, without destroying me.  Is very suitable for those who want to bit fit but not bulky.  And, yes, it is effective.  As well as fun enough that sometimes I put it in to do one segment---and wind up doing them all.  And yet challenging enough to sometimes reach for on an ""I'm ready for bear"" kind of day.

Recommend.  Recommend for Intermediate level exercisers and above.  Beginners will have to modify.",1361232000,2,1586,4.747252747252747
8176996,4,B000NDFHWK,"I have very muscley legs, and this workout had me sweating from start to end, its very easy to follow, I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner though. I'll write back in a week or so and let you guys know if ive noticed any difference!

Before this workout video i was using the Kim Kardashian fit in your jeans by friday, but my body started getting to use to it, so I thought that i'll just swtich it up for a while!",1316476800,,416,4.0120481927710845
8176997,3,B000NDFHWK,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

This was a solid workout that made me work up a sweat.  At any point where I was starting to fatigue, the instructor would always switch to another move or active recovery so it did not feel as difficult as it might have.  Actually, at some points I wish it had less breaks.  I used 10lb weights for this since the moves were slow and not too many reps for me to be able to keep up.  I have always like the instructor very much and this was no exception.

Some subjective cons:  I felt the music was a bit distracting rather than adding to the workout (moves almost off beat to music?)  I also did not care for the backdrop --- this may be some kind of famous or historical location but, to me, it just looked kind of messy and hot with all the tumbling stones in the back.  I actually tend to find outdoor backdrops distracting (looks too sunny, hot, distracting waves, wind, or movement, etc.) and prefer indoor locations for routines.  The only time I love the outdoors is for running (when your feet need no concentration and the distraction is welcome to overcome monotony.)  Overall, this workout was somehow just a bit dull for me --- did not love the moves although they did result in a decent workout.",1297555200,,1266,4.390557939914163
8176998,5,B000NDFHWK,This is such a great workout that will really get your heart rate up and make you sweat like there is no tomorrow. I love the trainer. She is so fit and has a really awesome accent that is just nice to listen to.,1257984000,,212,3.840909090909091
8176999,1,B000NDFHWK,"The excersices are good for developing legs but, seriously...sexy? Those are the worst I have ever seen. I would NOT want my legs to look like that. Check out Jillian' Michaels' stuff, it's much better.",1249430400,,202,4.8
8177000,3,B000NDFHWK,This is a good DVD and the Violet Zaki is not an irritating coach. But I find myself going back to LaloFit instead.,1246147200,,115,4.043478260869565
8177001,5,B000NDFHWK,"This is one of the easiest videos to follow. I achieve better results with this video than with any other leg specific video and I pretty much own them all. I like that she incorporates some arm exercises while working your legs but not too much so that your arms stay lean without getting large muscles. Although the video is leg specific I feel that I get a complete overall workout and this is my #1 video that I like to do. The only video I supplement this one with is a short ab specific workout. The instructor Violet Zaki has one of the easiest going personalities of any instructor but she still manages to motivate. Her presence is never irritating like a majority of the over hyper trainers on the mass videos out there. I highly recommend this video and Violet Zaki's other videos like ""Self-Your Best Butt Fast"".",1240704000,2,824,4.5
8177002,4,B000NDFHWK,"This workout had me a little sore the next day, which I always consider a sign that it's working.  Great combo of cardio and sculpting and the instructor keeps you going w/ her ""motivational speaking.""",1227398400,,201,4.742857142857143
