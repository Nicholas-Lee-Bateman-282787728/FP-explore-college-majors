8621959,5,B00GBFPTOA,"This DVD was so fun!  One of the best DVD 's I have to get me happy and in the mood to dance. Not to mention a great cardio workout! I love Samba! This was a wonderful introduction to samba! And I loved the way she explained the difference between samba and belly dance moves. It was great to see how after watching this DVD I can now create something different , unique and exciting to add to my dance. Thank you for inspiring me!",1411689600,,431,4.070588235294117
8621960,5,B00GBFPTOA,"I really like this video and I am in my older years and this helps me to limber up and it is so fun.  I would and will recommend this video to my friends and family that want something different, providing they have had some training in belly dance moves.  I wanted something different than the other belly dance videos I have seen and worked with and this was the ticket.  I plan on using this one at least twice a week! Because its fun! challenging too. I recommend this one and give it a try!",1388361600,,495,4.135416666666667

The warm-up felt very long to me.  I haven't danced in a while, so I went through the exercises, but essentially it went through all the basic bellydance movements as a way to increase range of motion and warm up those parts of the body.  It was a slow warm-up, reminding me of the warm-up we'd do in my first bellydance class.

It was followed by a technique section.  When one began and the other stopped was a little unclear to me, as it continued in the vein of a basic bellydance class.  However, some samba moves began to be taught here - and Tiffani demonstrated the difference between executing a common movement in Arabic style vs. Samba style.  She took the time to explain how the hands might differ, the intention and feeling of the movement.  Then the movements were drilled.  The movements were drilled to slow fusion music, rather than samba music. One suggestion I might have here is that the dancer might get a better feeling of how to dance a move ""samba-style"", if samba music were the background.

Then, the combinations began to be taught.  These are demonstrated to samba music, which is much faster, and the movements make sense with it.  The combinations actually are strung together into a complete choreography.  You learn each combination and drill it over and over again (many times).  Then you string it togethr from the top, and repeat a few times.  That means that the combination section of the DVD is very long.  Finally, you do the choreography completely several times.  Overall, the danceable portion of this DVD from warm-up through completion of the choreography is 70 minutes.  Optionally, you can turn on an all practice mode afterwards, which would extend it even further.  I like this feature because it means that next time, I don't have to re-learn the choreography slowly but can keep my heart-rate up by running through the practice at full-speed.  Some combinations were short, others were long - and none were technically difficult.  The challenging part was the speed of Samba and the unfamiliar new movements.  I have to compliment Tiffani's choice of choreography here - recognizing we bellydancers would be struggling with the pace, and new Samba style movements, she kept the choreography and combinations simple - yet fun.  I have to admit that I didn't ENJOY myself as much as I'd like to, simply because it was hard to keep up and I felt like I was flailing.  However, it was a good workout and I could see myself enjoying it much more once I get the hang of it.  Keep in mind that I took two months off from bellydancing between a foot injury and jaw surgery, so people who have been dancing more frequently might find this not challenging at all.

I did feel this DVD was lacking in any explanation about the history of Samba, the culture of Samba, or how the music is constructed.  I would have liked a basic description of the music, as that would have helped me dance to it.  Being familiar with middle eastern rhythms is invaluable to a bellydancer; but I often find in Latin dance styles (like the salsa class I took), the teachers assume you can figure this out on your own and do not need it explained.  I think it would be a nice addition, even if it were a bonus section on the DVD.

Overall, I did get what I wanted from it, a taste of samba and a fast-paced workout.  However, I didn't give it five stars because I didn't love the music chosen for the choreography or other sections of the DVD, and I wished there was more information about samba.",1386288000,2,3526,4.584664536741214
8621962,2,B00GBFPTOA,"I was expecting a lot from this DVD but I have to say I'm disappointed: 86 mn learning 5 very very short combinations that you drill again and again; for me it's a waste of time, I would have preferred more material and something more challenging. The part I like is the technique section with the demonstration between oriental and samba moves.
Even the music choice for the choreography is a simple samba rhythm more suitable for drilling combinations and not enought versatile for a choreography but it's not the most important.
If the DVD had had more contents so I would rate it better",1386288000,3,590,4.628571428571429
