8601054,5,B00E4Q6UQ4,"I got this movie from Kmart and so far this is the best of the eight movie westerns series because all eight movies are spaghetti westerns. Most of the movies haven't been released in america on DVD until now, and five of the eight movies are in there original 2.35:1 wide screen versions, though not 16 x 9 enhanced, their still good. Silver saddle man pride and vengeance, have a good funeral sartana will pay, sartana angel of death and shango are in the 2.35:1 letterboxed version. The unholy four, I am sartana trade your guns for a coffin, and black jack full screen which is a shame because I'm going to have to get the wild east version of I am sartana just to get the full wide screen version of the movie. Some of the films are shorter than their release version like have a nice funeral sartana will pay  my old full screen version from cinema deluxe is 4 minutes longer than the version on this DVD  though it don't matter to me because I rather have a shorter letterbox version than a longer full screen version. I would say this a very good DVD to buy and is worth every penny to get those 5 movies in there original 2.35:1 letterboxed versions.",1385510400,2,1159,4.361111111111111
