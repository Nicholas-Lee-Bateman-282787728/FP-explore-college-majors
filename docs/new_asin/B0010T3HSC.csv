8238420,5,B0010T3HSC,"I was hesitant to try this DVD.  Not sure why, but I did not want to do yoga.  But I stuck it in my DVD player and loved it from the start.  Petra has a gentle way of talking and presenting herself but, OMG can she work the heck out of me at the same time.  So she tortures my body, talks nice to me and makes me love it.  Petra and her work out are awesome.",1474588800,,358,3.5974025974025974
8238421,4,B0010T3HSC,"First and foremost, I love Petra's demeanor.  There is a warmth and tranquility about her that makes it very enjoyable working out with her.  Elegant Strength is a yoga/dance fusion workout at about the low intermediate level.  As a low advanced exerciser, I mainly do the standing leg portion of her workout.  I love the beautiful, dancer-like flow of the standing work that challenges my legs in many different ways.  Petra's movements never feel rushed and the pacing always feel just right to really be able to fully do the movements and get the most out of them.  The production quality is quite nice and the set is especially pleasing to the eye.  Petra works with two background exercisers.  The 60-minute workout is chaptered so you can play the entire workout or just choose body & breath connection, standing legs/core, standing total body, floor, core and/or stretch.",1360195200,8,878,4.925170068027211
8238422,4,B0010T3HSC,"First off...I ONLY BUY PETRA DVD's because her cueing is usually outstanding!
I liked this workout, but as a tall, curvy girl, some of the moves where difficult because of my own flexibility issues...or should i say IN-flexible issues. If you are a yoga, dance or Pilates person, and are familiar with the terminology, you will be able to follow along from the get go...me, its been a long time since I've done plies or Pilates..so it took me about 3 run threws before I could 'get' what move was next without looking at the TV.

Although her cueing isn't as good in this dvd, as say in her other, more fast paced workouts, i still appreciate that she gives you enough time to watch a move, then join in and perfect it, before moving on to the next move.

As another reviewer stated THERE ARE MANY MANY LUNGES in this video....as a Petra fan, I remember a previous workout TAPE (yes i said tape...that's how long I've been a fan of her's)...she said that if you cant/wont do lunges, if you keep a chair nearby, or have a bare wall you could do 'squats'(using the chair) or do 'sits' (against the wall)...for the same length of time a lunge is done, and still get roughly the same results. I prefer the 'sits'..its more quads n butt...less knees!

All in all, i was surprised at how much sweat was pouring down my face at the end of the workout..I'd forgotten how much of a workout a 'stretch' could truly be...but more importantly, i loved feeling the 'soreness' of my lower body the next day...now don't freak out..its not enough to kill ya...but you know that little extra amount of 'uhhh' you do when you're getting in or out of a chair the next day?....its THAT kind of soreness...the 'wow i really feel it today' kind....the kind that says...CANT WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN TOMORROW!..",1280275200,12,1783,4.496913580246914
8238423,4,B0010T3HSC,"I really like Petra - I have three other workouts of hers and enjoy her crisp accent and friendly outgoing way of instructing.  I bought this for a change of pace in toning and wanted a dvd with nice stetching.
This workout really blends dance with yoga with balance and stretch into regular body sculpting.  I have to say that I'm not a fan of lunges (they're about the only move I can't/won't do) and they feature in here of course.  Plies are great for your inner thighs and they also feature a lot.  They really make your legs burn (in a good way) and that's a hard area to tone so that's what I really like about this dvd.
All you need are some dumbbells, and you're set.  Petra is a great cuer and easy to listen to.  She makes this enjoyable and a workout I now do two times a week.  I like it.",1209427200,41,801,4.096153846153846
