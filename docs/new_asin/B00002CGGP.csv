1251949,5,B00002CGGP,"This collection of 24 videos is probably one of the best additions you'll ever make to your collection. Containing sons fro 1973 to tracks from Ferry's 'Mamouna' release in 1994, this spans one of the most artistic  singers of this generation. Included are rare never-before-seen in the US  clips of 'The Main Thing', 'A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall', 'These Foolish  Things', along with the standards of 'Slave To Love', 'Jealous Guy', and  'Same Old Scene'. A cherished treasure that looks as good as it sounds.",940377600,26,509,4.883720930232558
7915543,4,B00002CGGP,"If you're looking for old Roxy Music footage, look elsewhere.  You won't find much here.  But if you were a fan of Bryan Ferry's solo career and MTV, you should be pretty content with this collection.  Music videos didn't really take off until the 1980's, so that may explain the lack of older Roxy songs.  There are some glaring omissions (e.g. ""Avalon""), but I guess there's only so much that can be put on one disc.  And for the older folks, there are some Roxy Music tunes as well (""Re-Make/Re-Model"", ""Same Old Scene"", ""Angel Eyes""; ""The Main Thing"")",1081814400,4,555,4.622448979591836
7915544,4,B00002CGGP,"I personally don't understand the in's and out's of this particular situation - but looks like Video Collection is OOP in America, and maybe soon to be in Canada (until it sells out). Anyway, I got mine just after getting the video. Well maybe it isn't the greatest collection on earth but its better than nothing and that's what we have right now (until something else comes out). In the meantime you get a bunch of videos that are going to impress and some maybe not but hey, that's what the fast forward/next track buttom is for. And that's the beauty of DVD. When it comes to this disc there are a lot of videos to explore and they are really good, from the first Your Painted Smile to my favourite Don't Stop the Dance.
I think the real reason for the problem with the release of this DVD is the cheese factor, which could be a slight embarasment for The Man. I'm thinking of videos like These Foolish Things, What Goes On, Angel Eyes, You Go to My Head. These are my least favourite and could have been left out. Still, that leaves 20 videos that are well worth the price of this DVD. I've never seen the More than This video but I have seen an excerpt from Avalon and I don't miss it.
So get this disc in the meantime if you can't wait for a nebulous promise of something in the future. Oh, and in case Ferry and company are reading, how about releasing Live in Europe on DVD? That would make up for the fact that every North American release of the video had a sound problem in the audio. Now there's a greatest hits live video from yesteryear that would be a great compliment to this disc or any release in the future. So in the meantime, enjoy this disc!",1046304000,6,1664,4.268987341772152
7915545,1,B00002CGGP,"Evidently, this DVD release was NOT authorized by either Bryan Ferry or his Management and they have pulled future release of this due to too many omissions.  Not only are the releases ""More Than This"" and ""Avalon"" missing, but so are Bryan Ferry's solo releases post 1995.  Also, there are more earlier video releases both from Roxy Music & Bryan Ferry that are missing.  On top of that, the picture quality is lacking on some of the videos on the DVD.  Bryan Ferry is going to release a NEW and COMPLETE version between 2003-2004 with many extras.  I would imagine the NEW version that will be released will be like the recent two DVD release by David Bowie which is excellent in every way with every release including rare BBC & Dick Cavett performances.  It may be a good idea to avoid this release and wait for the Bryan Ferry AUTHORIZED version.",1043798400,19,851,4.565789473684211
7915546,4,B00002CGGP,"The videos in this collection give a good cross-reference of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry's solo work.  The quality of the early videos is fair, but the sound is good, nonetheless.  The later videos are fantastic, and sound better than the remastered CD's.  But, there's one big omission...where is the video of ""Avalon""?  I've always considered ""Avalon"" one of the most sensual and atmospheric videos of all time, and was disappointed to find that it was not here.  Still, the DVD is worth it, as we see the evolution of Roxy Music's style from avant-garde art-rock to a more soulful and almost-mainstream band, with the charismatic trio of Ferry, Manzanera and Mackay holding things together throughout the years, and Ferry's development as a single artist growing with each release.
In all, I think Roxy and Ferry fans will be pleased...but, I still want to see ""Avalon"" sometime in the future.  :-)",1035158400,13,900,4.927152317880795
7915547,4,B00002CGGP,"I have bought a number of DVD music video collections within the last few months, only to be disappointed in some respects with what I receive. The Tina Turner ""Video"" collection has about 5 live performances instead of the music videos for example. Now, I get the Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music video collection, only to have some disappointments there as well. There are 24 tracks and most of the older,early 70's Roxy Music songs are again, live concert shots. At least the Bryan Ferry solo videos are all videos. There are some GLARING omittances as well. SHAME ON VIRGIN HOME VIDEO! They did not even include the videos for ""More Than This"" and ""Avalon"". I was so hoping that they would be on there, since the fans consider the Avalon album a masterpiece! Nevertheless, I am glad to have many of the rare videos that are on this dvd. Such as ""Limbo"", ""Is Your Love Strong Enough"" (also on the Legend DVD), ""Angel Eyes"", ""Slave To Love"", ""Don't Stop The Dance"", and ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"". I would recommend this for the rarity of what is on here, but still feel a little let down that 2 of the most important songs/videos are not included. I think some of these companies need to take a harder look at what they are putting out in the marketplace!",1034208000,6,1249,4.530973451327434

7915549,5,B00002CGGP,"For all of us who truly love the finest productions,this is one that must be swallowed. A beautiful collection of 24 separately filmed VIDS spanning much of Bryan's fabulous career. Heck, I'm gunna' go watch it now.........HELLO to the MAN!!!",1027209600,2,242,5.075
7915550,5,B00002CGGP,Sas a 20 odd year brian ferry roxy music fan I can only say I love this tape. The song a fantastic the women even more so (especialy anna nichole smith  on will you still love me tommorow and jerry hall on lets stick together! I recomend this to any Roxy fan. When will these guys get back together and make a new CD.,997401600,3,317,3.953125
7915551,3,B00002CGGP,"I was a little disappointed that except for re-make/re-model, none of Roxy Music's early works appear on this video. Where is Mother of Pearl? Ladytron? Even Virginia Plain? On the other end, I sorely miss not having  Avalon on here.  Bryan Ferry is well represented in terms of his early solo  work, and his videos are supremely stylish. Most of them feature bone-thin  models, but some have more personality -- sometimes even laughing! The bit  with Jerri Hall in ""Let's Stick Together"" is hilarious! The band  is well-represented as well, with shots of Manzanera, McKay, Chris  Spedding, even Eno.",951177600,10,600,5.0
7915552,5,B00002CGGP,"The amazing thing about this video is you see Bryan Ferry span almost 20 years, and hardly change at all!  My favorite odd pairing is Anna Nicole Smith and Bryan in the ""Will You Love Me Tommorrow"" video. All in  all a great collection, and everything here looks so good.  Only one gripe,  really!  WHERE IS THE VIDEO FOR AVALON THAT RIDLEY SCOTT DIRECTED?  It's  not on here, and I wonder why.  Other than that, I loved all the videos and  if you are a fan you will too.  A wise purchase!",944611200,8,489,4.217391304347826
