7689338,5,B01CT4CETE,"Season 4 is the darkest season by far.  The president and his wife are fighting to remain in control of the presidency. They are challenged by a young, attractive, Kennedy like opponent. It's about the dark treachery that goes on to be elected to the presidency. The plots within plots are intricate and cannot begin to be anticipated. This is a must watch. Can't wait for Season 5 as the ending left me hanging.",1468281600,,412,4.5675675675675675

7689340,1,B01CT4CETE,"Love House of Cards Season 1-3 but sure mad that Season 4 NOT available online/streaming via Amazon or for Kindle -- only on DVD to be shipped to an address.  WHY IS THAT???? It was available on DVD March 2016. Amazon says it's up to the provider (NetFlix) but what in the world is logical about releasing on DVD but not to Amazon online/Kindle owners/watchers? This has happened with movies NOT available to use that are even on TV on low level channels for Pete's sake.

Otherwise LOVE House of Cards and look forward to Season 4. Please Amazon - come on fix this! (thanks!)",1468108800,,576,4.476190476190476
7689341,3,B01CT4CETE,"Nice rebound after the disappointing season three. Really liked the first half, and felt that the show had finally seemed to accept that it is a soap opera and stopped taking itself so seriously and trying to be the new Sopranos or Breaking Bad. Was a tad disappointed with the second half though, particularly with the whole Claire and Frank running mates storyline, which I just found really stupid.",1468022400,,401,4.826086956521739
7689342,5,B01CT4CETE,"This mesmerising political drama enters it's fourth season as we follow the fortunes of the 'Underwood's' and their
struggle to cling on to power no-matter what the cost, remembering that his rise to the top job had been achieved
not by the vote but by corrupt and underhand dealings.....'Francis Underwood' (Kevin Spacey) without the support
of his estranged wife 'Claire' (Robin Wright) now faces opposition for his leadership in the primary's leading up to
the next Presidential Election.
'Francis' has few allies, in fact most both sides of the 'house' hate his guts, without aide 'Doug Stamper' (Michael Kelly)
and loyal body-guard 'Edward Meechum' (Nathan Darrow) he has no friends.
'Clair' remains ambitious and will do anything to undermine her husband to achieve political advancement, it's difficult
to decide which of the two are the most devious and ruthless in truth.
With the Country in turmoil at the pumps because of a dispute with Russia coupled with a damaging disclosure 'Francis'
soon falls behind in the primary's to rival for the Democrat-Nomination 'Heather Dunbar' (Elizabeth Marvel)
Though after an incident involving 'Francis' his team are quick to exploit an uninvited meeting 'Heather Dunbar' had had
to discredit her credibility.
'Clair's' mother has a terminal-illness, even this will be used to gain ground....
The at-odds couple will realize eventually that if they stand any chance of beating the charismatic family-man and Republican
Presidential candidate 'Will Conway'(Joel Kinnaman) to the White House they will have to join forces.
Will the American public at large give the keys of The White House back to this manipulative and self-serving couple or will
they see through the smoke-screen ?......is the opposition really a worthy alternative ?
The final episode will leave you gasping and wanting more....it'll also have you questioning what depths the Underwood's wll
not reach into to survive
Again, a compelling political drama that remains a must-see
Am delighted that a 5th Season for the series is forthcoming (it's needed....too much left to be resolved)",1468022400,,2101,5.331325301204819

7689344,5,B01CT4CETE,This is one of the best series I have seen. Love it,1467676800,,51,3.3333333333333335
7689345,3,B01CT4CETE,"Am I the only one who has noticed the similarities of the names of the two ""heroes"" of this tale to those of that other famous couple, St. Francis and St. Clare?  A coincidence, probably but certainly a telling one.  If it's true that we can't see light without darkness, this story will provide a lot of shadow by which we can appreciate  the light of that other pair of lovers. Both couples worked tirelessly together for a shared purpose.  The saints' purpose was for the glory of God and to do good to others, especially the poor..  The Underwoods work tirelessly together to further their own good.

Season 4 of House of Cards is more interesting than Season 3, in my opinion but not as good as the initial two.  There is something really boring about seeing evil people do nasty things.  I think it's called the 'banality of evil.""  I was not going to watch this round but I got drawn in and found that there were a few more humane elements to it than the previous one to keep my interested..Political gains and some ""acts of God"" like illness, accidents and death have brought Frakcis and Clair back together to work as a team and there seems to be a stronger emotional bond between them. .  There are some sequences featuring Clair's mother, brilliantly played by Ellen Burstyn. that are genuinely moving. There is a good guy, a writer, appropriately garbed in rumpled corduroys who appears to be above the fray of the insistent play of ego games.  Even Doug Stamper finds something like a love interest in a very unusual way.  For me this was a relief from the constant political gamesmanship that constituted most of Season 3.  There is still the race to hang on to the White House, and this brings an interesting new set of villains, the Governor of New York and his gorgeous wife.  The Governor is a worthy challenger and a good mirror to Frank for his own ruthlessness.

What is interesting about the writing is that we find ourselves rooting for Frank against the really odious Governor at the same time that we find ourselves rooting for an ildealistic journalist who is hot on the trail to expose Frank's former crimes.

The script stays up to date by incorporating ISIS type atrocities.  And one can't escape the parallels to our own political leaders and the depths to which they sink to get elected.  There are a few heroes--people who do what they do because of their moral convictions.  Most of the folks are in on the game and we see how they compromise their integrity either for gain or to avoid being crushed.

The acting is still first rate.  I do wonder about the fellow who plays Remy Dalton who seems to have a problem with the English language but fortunately he's not in a lot of the scenes.  There is an abusndance of  super smart women with long hair  and tight clothes.  Spacey seems to have put on weight which ages him down and gives him something of a humanizing quality. He's a little slower and we don't get as many of his humorous asides to the audience that actually endeared him to us in Season I.  Wright looks even  better than ever even though she's never learned to walk gracefully in those 4"" heels.  It's definitely her season; she's come into her own in many ways, finding her voice, her power and her ability to have a lover under Frank's approving eye.  It seems that she's on the upswing even as Frank seems to be desclining.

 One wonders where the writers will take this next Season.  After the death of St. Francis, St. Clare carried on his work. That might be a good ending for this series.  I hope the next season will be the last and that it will make it worth watching all of these shows..",1458345600,28,3648,4.4787878787878785
7689346,5,B01CT4CETE,"House of Cards in general is a unique and fantastic show, many complained about Season 3 for some odd reason while personally I have loved every Season and every intense filled Episode equally. How long can a show like this run realistically? Well, if it continues to be a hit then I assume the longest it can go is another 4 years if Frank wins the Presidency but it remains to be seen if the writers, the audience and Netflix would want to maintain it for another 4 whole years... Personally I didn't think the show could go beyond a total of 4 years but I was wrong - I figured once he becomes President there was nowhere to go with the story, their achievement reached and Frank and Claire's relationship about to implode but the writers dug themselves out and Season 5 looks like the Underwoods are back to their ruthless best yet again - so Season 5 looks to be an awakening of sorts or a second chance for the Underwoods... As far as Season 4 goes it is excellent and on par with Season 1 but I really do not separate the Seasons of this show as many would do - for me it is House of Cards, the continuing saga and each Season, each Episode is a Chapter in this delicious book. I am one who believes in characters who exhibit intelligence, taste and terror all at once. And like Hannibal Lector - Fran and Claire Underwood have become my very favorite fictional villains - they share a lot with Lector (as played by Anthony Hopkins) and this is why we watch. There are no heroes in House of Cards only delightful villains and we thrill in their villainy - Hannibal Lector, Darth Vader, Loki, J.R. Hewing, Frank and Claire Underwood... they stir our imaginations and we admire them to a degree, we are both repulsed and fascinated by them and their machinations. A hero is a wonderful thing, but House of Cards proves you don't even need a hero for a good story but you will always, always need a good villain.",1458259200,5,1916,4.369747899159663
7689347,5,B01CT4CETE,"'House of Cards' season 4 gives us two very important propositions, is President Francis Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, going for another term, and if so, will Claire, played by Robin Wright be with him. Yes, and maybe.

An untoward event does bring Francis and Claire closer. Doug Stamper, played by Michael Kelly, who is the Chief of Staff shows some humanity while at the same time trying to save Francis from many misdeeds. Of them all, Doug Stamper is my favorite, and I cannot see this series without him. He is the personification of what is wrong with politics and the human being,  while at the same time he keeps the group together, and somehow manages to gain my sympathy.

The opposing Republican challenger for President,  Gov. Will Conway, played by Joel Kinnaman, is superb. He reminds me of a young Francis, but he gets caught up in his ego. Several new players here, Ellen Burstyn, who's the best, plays Claire's mother, Elizabeth. Elizabeth, lives in Texas, and she is undergoing therapy for cancer, and has always hated Francis. At the same time from Texas, we meet Neve Campbell, who plays LeAnn, as Claire's manager, of sorts.

This season is the season of Claire. Fighting Francis, wondering if their marriage will work, finding a place for herself in this marriage, and striking out for whatever she needs. Season 4 is a winner, just as season 3 was just so-so. Are great things coming for the Underwoods, hard to tell, they will go down fighting though, if it comes to that.

Watching Frank and Claire claw their way to the top that 2nd season was the show's peak. Watching Frank grow more desperate and hysterical in season 3, and Claire grow more preposterously power-mad in seasons 3 and 4, is not so much fun. The story was never what you'd call realistic, and always had a strong whiff of American Gothic about it, but by this 4th season it's more like Grand Guignol. The evil genius of the first two seasons was the way it made you root for these horrible people in spite of yourself.

7689552,5,B01CT4CETE,"House of Cards: The Complete Fourth Season continues the saga of Frank and Claire Underwood as they connive, plot, and claw their way to the top of Washingtons power pyramid.
Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), now President, is determined to seek a second term. At the end of Season 3, the Underwoods marriage was on shaky ground. This season, Claire (Robin Wright) is more aggressive in following her own political agenda and hires a high-powered assistant (Neve Cammpbell) but is sidetracked to Texas to visit her estranged, ailing mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn).

Frank has a formidable challenger for President in New York governor Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). He also faces a terrorist hostage situation, considerable machinations within the White House, and a life-threatening situation that keeps him out of commission for a time.

Francis and Claire Underwood are two of the most Machiavellian characters on TV, and it is great fun to watch their ambition drive nefarious plots to move their opponents methodically and deliberately like chess pieces. The writing is excellent and juggles lots of characters, assorted subplots, and twists and turns. Some of the situations mirror the current Presidential campaign. Truth aping fiction, or vice versa?

There are no bonus features on the 4-disc, 13-episode Blu-ray set.",1471564800,,1325,5.360576923076923

7689567,5,B01CT4CETE,"Season 4... couldn't wait to get it. My husband and I are totally hooked. Drama, suspense, romance, adultery, dirty deeds and all the nail biting stuff that makes a good series.  With the current election going on, this one really makes you wonder what happens behind the scenes in politics.  The story completely changes from this point.  The end of season 3 was a cliffhanger and this one picks up right where it left off.  We have to discipline ourselves not to binge watch so we don't get left hanging for a block of time while we wait for the next season to come out.  Thank goodness there is a season 5 right  behind this... although I think right now it is a preorder.  The social dynamic in this thriller runs so deep and tackles hot topics like race, power, sexual equality, gender identity, sex trafficking, drug addiction, politics, murder, mental issues, instability, family power plays, societal ranking, economic divide.... They have covered it all. I won't give away any information - I won't be a spoiler, but some of the moments of tension take a huge turn and leave you totally surprised.  Brilliant.  This is a really good series. I would highly recommend it... just make sure and watch it from season 1.  Without the history and backstory, much of what happens in Season 4 doesn't make sense. Well, it does, but the backstory really really makes it all the more tense and exciting. Watch it from the beginning.",1471046400,3,1430,4.684

7689613,4,B01CT4CETE,"++++WARNING....This will contain spoilers from the prior seasons, but no major giveaways from season 4.  If you have not seen the first few seasons, proceed at your own risk++++

The 4th season rebounds quite well from what I thought was a lackluster season 3.  Frank is now in a fight to get re-elected, and his actions rival that of seasons 1 and 2 when he was trying for his power grab.  Also, his past activities are slowly coming back to haunt him as the story lines involving Zoe Barnes and to some extent Peter Russo (both Kate Mara and Corey Stoll make guest appearances to haunt frank during the season), started by Lucas Goodwin's release from prison and Tom Hammerschmidt starts investigating Frank's dealings trying to out him as the crook that he is.

The two main themes of the season are the re-election fight, which still involves Heather Dunbar, the Republican candidate Will Conway, played by The Killing's  and Suicide Squad's Joel Kinnaman, and Claire maneuvering her way into more power despite leaving Frank at the end of Season 3.  There is also an ISIS like story line that carries throughout the season (called ISO in the series) and very much takes prominence by the end of the season.  While there is no outright cliff hanger this season, it does set up the 5th season quite nicely.

Robin Wright is again a standout this season, as she balances her feelings for Frank with her lust for power, and again shows that she is willing to do anything, including exploiting her dying mother to get what she wants.  Robin Wright also directed a couple of the better episodes of the season.  Michael Kelly also returns as the threatening and creepy Doug Stamper (and yes he is both over the course of the season) who continues to do anything and everything to keep Frank in power.  He encounters a rival in the form of Neve Campbell's character, Leann Harvey, who is a political consultant helping Claire.

The season really returns to the games that Frank Played during the first couple season that ultimately makes the series so great.  He is very much like a threatened animal this season, which makes him (and Claire) even more dangerous, as the closing shot in the season finale makes abundantly clear.  It definitely leaves you wanting more by the time it is over.

For those who are considering getting the blu-rays vs just streaming it, there are no extras like deleted scenes or behind the scenes materials like there have been in the first few seasons.  So if those are your main reasons for getting the discs, there is really no need.  If you want them just to add to an existing collection then the A/V quality is pretty much on par with the prior releases.  It also has the same crappy packaging (the very tight slip cases) which could easily scratch DVDs, although stand up to the blu ray anti scratch coating okay.  But they are hard to get out without risking tearing the case, but at this point they are what they are.  So ultimately I recommend the season.  The show itself is very much 5 stars.  The lack of extras and the bad packaging knocks the release down a star for me.",1469318400,3,3112,4.618181818181818
7689614,5,B01CT4CETE,"Since I am very anti spoiler I will just say that this is one of the best seasons of house of cards yet.

7689615,5,B01CT4CETE,"I have been hooked on this series from the first season.  Now in this fraught political climate, I find it refreshing to become enmeshed again in the Underwood's power plays.  There is a purity in their lust for power that overcomes all other drives and simplifies their conflicts -- intra-marrital and external both.  To see them in action is to watch a skilled and ruthless machine that leaves wrecked lives in its wake.  Washington DC seems kinder in comparison, but unfortunately far less effective.  The story is at once instructive and cautionary. The writing and acting are extraordinary.  As with any effective artistic product, details are made to count.  The lust for power that is the essence of the Underwood's marriage  is reflected in the clean, simple lines of the costumes and sets.  And it is the occasional small gesture or remark addressed directly to the camera that captures the sympathy of the viewer for the otherwise psychotic and obsessed character of President Francis Underwood.",1469318400,,1005,5.042424242424242

7689624,5,B01CT4CETE,"Season 4 comes back with a vengeance!

(Mild Season 3 spoilers in this paragraph. Nothing on Season 4) I was pretty sour on season 3. The whole season felt like it was just a set up for a plot shift. Frank was campaigning. The Democrats didn't want him to. There was all the business about trying to manipulate the primary by adding fake candidates and trying to get real candidates to take other jobs. then there was the storyline with the Russians and gay rights. All of these things could have been interesting but they just stagnated over the course of 13 episodes and didn't really progress much. Then there was that softer side of Claire Underwood business in season 3...like what? That was a total rewrite of her entire character. Season 3 ends without anyone or any situation being terribly different from how it started. And it was just kind of boring. If season 4 had kept that same pace this show would have lost me.

But nope!!! Season 4 came roaring back with authority! Frank and Claire redefine themselves as the two most heartless human beings on the face of the Earth and are willing to use their complete lack of morality for their own personal goals. (You know...the same Frank and Claire you remember from seasons 1 and 2)

Once again you find yourself rooting for Frank and Claire for some reason you can't understand because you just can't stop yourself from hating them as politicians and as human beings. The Underwoods, and pretty much everyone else on the show playing an elected official, represent all that we hate about politicians. But somehow the show gets you rooting for them, even if you turn on the real news afterwards and yell at the TV when you see our real politicians doing the same stuff.

There are HUGE plot twists in season 4 that you absolutely don't see coming. They blindside you out of nowhere. I'm not getting into any details. Don't worry. But just when you think you know what the Underwoods are going to do next the writers throw you a curve ball. It keeps the show fresh and interesting to watch. And there are a lot of early season plot points that get resurrected as well. (Again, I'm not saying which ones)

The shows still manages, even after 4 seasons, to be pretty much apolitical. I think that's a huge part of the success of the show. Frank Underwood is a Democrat, but there is no reason he has to be. He's not out crusading for historically Democratic causes as a major plot of the series. The classic liberal and classic conservative platforms are mentioned a lot (Democrat Claire does an anti gun campaign. Republican presidential candidate makes anti terrorism speeches), but these are never made into major plot elements. They are really just there to give the parties something to fight about on the show. Plus it keeps you as the viewer from taking sides or being offended based on your own personal politics.

It also shows that regardless of what the issue is, the politicians don't actually care about it. They just pretend to care for votes and use issues we care about as a society to maintain their power.

The Republican characters and Democrat characters on the show could easily swap political parties right in the middle of an episode and it wouldn't impact the storyline at all. The show is about how both parties are only interested in preserving their own power and nothing more. Sadly, that cynical but hyper realistic view of our government is what makes the show appealing to an audience with diverse political leanings.

This show would almost be a comedy if you couldn't stop yourself from believing that our actual government is actually run this way.",1468540800,,3639,4.675
