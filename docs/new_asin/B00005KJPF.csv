7943530,1,B00005KJPF,"Based on the cover art (Val, Kate and Zero aircraft profiles) and text you are lead to believe this is an in-depth study of Japanese Air Power. To quote the text from the back of the DVD ""...these programs vividly tell the story of the rise of Japanese Air Power...""

The DVD length is 103 minutes and is broken into two sections:

Part 1 From Sword to Zero
Part 2 Flights Beyond Pearl Harbor

Here are some examples of the ""Japanese"" Air Power covered:

Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic
The aircraft carrier USS Langley
Early British warships converted to launch WW1 aircraft
Jimmy Doolittles Tokyo Raid
US Navy Admiral Halsey (spelled as Holsey in the documentary)

You would be hard pressed to find a Japanese manufactured aircraft in part 1 of the documentary. The majority of the video in part 1 shows modified US trainers from the ""Tora Tora Tora"" movie or US Navy SBD Dauntless dive bombers painted with Japanese markings. Some of the inflight footage of the ""Tora Tora Tora"" aircraft looks like it was taken with a hand held camera from another aircraft at an airshow and is not steady.

Part 2 actually shows Japanese combat aircraft in action along with some rare video of destroyed US P-35 fighters on the ground in the Philippines.

Except for the items mentioned in part 2 of this documentary there are very few reasons to watch this documentary.

I wanted to rate this item a .5 star but 1 star is the lowest rating available.

Avoid this DVD if you can or you may end-up having ""vivid"" buyers remorse as I did.",1363910400,,1531,4.599264705882353
