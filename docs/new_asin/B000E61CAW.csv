8496590,5,B000E61CAW,"This is a marvelous, unforgettable story of how greed can destroy a life, or many lives.  Anton Walbrook is terrific as a Russian army officer who is jealous of his fellow officers who come from wealthy and powerful families.  He feels they get all the breaks, all the promotions, all the glory.  He sets about to exact his revenge on the world, with a bit of supernatural assistance.  He would sell his soul and use anyone, any way he can (including an old woman and a young, innocent woman), to gain money and power.  The entire story is startling and powerful, with a chilling climax.

I saw this movie on TV many years ago, and I have been searching for it for quite some time.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Watching it again, after all these years, I was still deeply affected.",1490918400,,791,4.36986301369863

8496593,3,B000E61CAW,"The 1949 origina cinema version of Pushkins short story the Queen of Spades, is a grandscale lavish period drama from Rusia that focuses upon greed, gambling and selling one's soul to the devil! This movie is not really a ghost story, it is more a lavish period drama that has fine acting and a credible story line  that is quite impressive. But for the ghost conniseur, it is likely to leave you a bit dissapointed because there is only one short scene that really causes any fright or creepiness! The story is about a poor Russian army captain who is desperate to learn the secret of the cards and will do anything including stealing the secrets from an old countess who  is believed to have sold her soul to the devil to gain the knowledge. The captain is a rogue and gets his in the finish. The movie has fine acting and some polished performances and is worth a look but don't expect too many thrills or chills.
