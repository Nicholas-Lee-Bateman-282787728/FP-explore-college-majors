8698991,5,B00SOPOTAK,It is a great show even with season 1 having the only dub. Unfortunately Seasons 1-3 were originally made by a different company from the one that now owns the series. The original company went out of business soon after season 1 was released dubbed on DVD. I have noticed that Sentai only dubs anime they are 90% certain will make a decent profit for them since dubbing is expensive. They are probably very reluctant to dub a series from a company that went out of business because they probably fear they will loose money not make it. So I doubt the rest of the series will ever be dubbed.,1427328000,2,591,4.381818181818182
