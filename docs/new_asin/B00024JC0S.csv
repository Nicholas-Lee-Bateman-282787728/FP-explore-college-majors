8022182,4,B00024JC0S,Every teacher should own this video. Keep it under lock and key though. Other teachers are thieves.,1145318400,8,99,4.882352941176471
8022183,5,B00024JC0S,"The speeches are really superb ones.  They are abridged, which makes them perfect for a Social Studies class.  Naturally, some of the video and audio is less than great, since they were recorded some time ago, but that is more than made up for by the content.",1140480000,13,259,4.48936170212766
8022184,4,B00024JC0S,"This is a wonderful selection of great speeches. However, beware they are not all complete. The  Martin Luther King ""I Have a Dream"" speech  skips the critical beginning paragraphs. That alone is reason to pass on this CD.",1140048000,26,222,4.815789473684211
8022185,1,B00024JC0S,Not at all impressive...  Just recorded few lines in each speech... clarity of audio is OK...... I suggest you not to buy this.,1121731200,50,127,4.521739130434782
