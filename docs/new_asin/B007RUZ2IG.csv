5109348,5,B007RUZ2IG,"Yet another great western that didn't get a showing in Australia as far as I know.  One doesn't need to say any more that it's a top effort all round.  If you haven't seen it, buy it now!",1394928000,,187,3.8947368421052633
5109349,5,B007RUZ2IG,Loved this movie!  Fess Parker's character was loveable and comfortable.  To think that this was years after his Davy Crockett role was amazing.  You'll never guess who the woman goes off with until the very end of the movie!  So glad I discovered this one after all these years.,1393977600,,279,4.63265306122449

5109354,4,B007RUZ2IG,"In addition to having a fine cast with a fine array of character actors, the script is uttertly marvelous.  Tina Louise shows us what she could have done had she not been put into the sexpot roles that ruined her.  What's utterly fascinating about the film is that although this is a hunt for justice, there' no 'bad guy,' with the exception of the outlaw jailed in the first minute of the film.  A fascinating thing to see in a Western.  If Johnny's an outlaw, then he's one we like, so do we really want to see him captured?

5109355,4,B007RUZ2IG,"The Hangman was Robert Taylor's first independent film after leaving MGM. In later years, he would describe it as one of his failures.  Like many Taylor movies, it's an unusual twist on a familiar subject.  Mackenzie Bovard, a Deputy Marshal, is famous for his ability to catch criminals who are later hanged.  Bovard is cynical and world weary with a poor opinion of his fellow humans.  Pursuing a robbery suspect, he meets the young and lovely Tina Louise. Through his relationship with her Bovard gradually regains his faith in humanity and becomes a much warmer and more likeable person.  This is far from a typical western--no fight scenes, no gorgeous scenery, no evil villains.  As another reviewer noted, it's a drama set in the old West.  It's about responsibility, right and wrong and personal development and growth.  Taylor is excellent, as always, in his understated way.  Tina Louise is good as a young woman who changes from a drab loser to a confident woman.  Mabel Albertson is wonderful as a middle-aged woman who has the hots for Taylor (who can blame her?).  Fess Parker, post Davy Crockett is effective as a town Sheriff and his laid back persona makes a good contrast to the driven, more intense Taylor.  Perhaps not a classic but definitely worth watching and owning.",1337644800,44,1290,4.86697247706422

5109358,4,B007RUZ2IG,"The Taylor character is called The Hangman because he is always successful in capturing and bringing wanted criminals to trial, where they are hanged. In this 1959 black and white film, he is a deputy marshal assigned to find and bring in a man wanted for participating in a robbery and murder. The problem is that it seems that no one knows what the man looks like. Taylor is looking forward to retiring after this job. He had started as a lawyer but people found that he was good as a deputy marshal and he stayed on the job. He is not satisfied with his work as a marshal. He is sorry he gave up being a lawyer. He has a bad opinion of people. Among other pessimistic ideas, he believes that all people would be willing to hurt others if paid to do so. These two last sentences describe the main plot of the film. For it is not a typical action western. It is more of a subtle psychological study of a man who comes to realize that people can be good and that when you are good, people like you and help you.
Taylor discovers that a young beautiful 26-year-old woman was once very friendly with the alleged criminal. He offers her the $500 reward money if she would identify the alleged criminal. She is very reluctant to do so. His relationship with this much younger woman is a subplot in the film.
Taylor spies a man who fits the description of the alleged criminal, but the whole town, without exception, are protecting him. Taylor comes to understand why they do so.",1472774400,,1474,4.363636363636363

5109363,4,B007RUZ2IG,"The Hangman, 1959 film

A Deputy US Marshal is after John Butterfield for robbery-murder. Bovart is the toughest lawman in the territory. He goes to the Army post then to a town to look around. Who passed those stolen coins? Money talks. Bovart walks around the town to look the man. Mrs. Ceila Jennison arrives late. She will make a sign when she recognizes the wanted man. Men fight to create action. Bovart trust no one. Buck Weston is the Sheriff. At night Mrs. Jennison gives a warning letter to Mr. Bishop! There is comedy when Mrs. Jennison walks to that gate. [Without a hat?] Bovart notices Bishops actions. He follows Ceila out of town and they talk. [That dip in the pond seems designed to attract customers. It isn't part of the story.]

Bovart talks to Big Murphy; can he identify Butterfield? Can Bovart tell if Ceila left her room? Yes, he follows her to a house. She warns Johnny (who won't leave his wife). There are gunshots. I missed him. Bovart meets Ceila to learn more. The next morning Bovart acts to find Johnny. Was there a trick to save Johnny? Bovart rides south toward the border to catch that wagon. Later Bovart tells Ceila about his past, how he became a lawman. He gives her advice. Johnny has friends who want to help him to escape. He got away! Bovart shoots and misses him. He decides its time to go to California for a new life. There is a surprise at the end.

This is an interesting story about personal relationships. It is set in the Old West but could be a modern parable. The actual history of the Old West is more interesting than most dramas. The classic westerns of the 1930s-1940s involved conflicts between homesteaders and small ranchers against the big ranchers or cattle barons. These were inspired by the Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming.",1409702400,4,1791,4.573208722741433
5109364,5,B007RUZ2IG,I think this movie is well done with a surprising but happy ending. For any western fans this is well worth having in your collection.,1405728000,,134,4.4
5109365,4,B007RUZ2IG,"Entertaining western with a bit of a different twist.  Only thing I've seen of Tina Louise other than Gilligan's Island, and Fess Parker manages not to totally be Davy or Dan'l, which he hadn't invented at this point so that was fun to see.  Well worth the price of the DVD.",1404518400,,274,4.352941176470588

8521519,3,B007RUZ2IG,"Not one of Robert Taylor's best.  Weak plot and equally weak acting.  Slow moving with a predictable ending.  Ho hum.  If you're looking for a good Robert Taylor western go with Saddle the Wind, Westward the Women, or The Law and Jake Wade.  Couldn't give it 2-1/2 stars so I gave it three just because of Taylor and Fess Parker (although his role was way too folksy for me.)  Weak effort all the way around.",1517011200,,408,4.373333333333333

8521522,4,B007RUZ2IG,"Outlaws called him ""The Hangman"". He preferred ""Deputy United States Marshal"".
It was a period of stagecoaches and horses, long 'bustle' dresses and silk stockings. The black 'string' tie
was a tradition with men, usually seen in a more formal attire.

Robert Taylor was in his glory, filming 'top of the line' movies with MGM.  ""The Hangman"" was his first film
after leaving MGM.  Given that Michael Curtiz had a fine reputation for Directing, it was a big change
for Taylor.

This storyline would not have been much without some action and comedy. Robert Taylor, American actor
'extraordinaire' called 'Mac' Bovard, was on a chase to arrest the last of a gang involved in a Wells Fargo
holdup.  Bovard was tired of catching criminals and wanted to move on with his life of a more pleasant
environment, as seen in a surprise ending!

Directed by Hungarian born Michael Curtiz, his films progressed from the 'silent era' to ""B"" pictures and his
methods of directing won various awards. There was no hesitation to combine actors together in a specific
production who were entirely different in their acting careers. Curtiz is known for his legendary ""Casablanca""
and ""Mildred Pierce"".

If you like Robert Taylor, watch ""The Hangman""!
