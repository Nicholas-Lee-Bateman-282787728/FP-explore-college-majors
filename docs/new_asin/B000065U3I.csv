7961372,1,B000065U3I,"Prime did it again -- This movie was made in 1986!!
The Patriot 2002 was Mel Gibson.
I am really frustrated with Amazon Prime using incorrect release dates on so many movies. It's annoying & wastes time! It's confusing enough trying to remember if I've already seen a certain film & incorrect dates makes it nearly impossible to find correct trailer.",1483228800,,350,4.754098360655738

7961379,1,B000065U3I,"A terrorist organistion hijacked a few nukes, and now terrorises the known world. Sound familiar?
Well, there's a few things that make THIS movie set out. THESE terrorists all act like crap. In fact, the 'hero' (A dismissed navy seal with the charisma of a roadkill skunk) has you wishing the terrorists would kill him already.
Why'd I buy this movie? Simple. Leslie Nielsen was pictured on the cover (the Dutch version at least). Being a fan of him, and hoping to come across an older movie in which his acting skills still were appreciated, I picked it up.
Yes, he does well. No, he's not in the movie for longer than 5 minutes.
I'm a huge movie fan, but this has me feeling I wasted an hour and a half of my life.
Step around this one.",1089849600,5,738,4.355072463768116
7961380,1,B000065U3I,"Don't be confused by the name; there are other, and much better ""The Patriot"" films staring Mel Gibson or Steven Seagal and then there's Patriot Games staring Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan.  In this 1986 movie a former Navy SEAL who was dishonorably discharged, was called back to the Navy to recover a stolen Navy nuclear weapon.  It's not often that I have given less than 3 stars to a military movie; they are my favorite review.  But this film, with Leslie Nielsen as its star is as poorly done as I've ever reviewed.  I tried to like it; in fact I tried to watch it!  No luck.  If you're like me and in to military movies, the title ""The Patriot"" sound inviting, and it is if it's the one with Mel Gibson!  ...This poor film of the same name is rated R for a brief sex scene and military violence.  ...",1022284800,10,804,4.243421052631579
