2591780,3,B000FUTV2I,"My son (almost 4) LOVES him some Thomas, but some of these older (are they from the 80s? 90s? unsure) episodes are really just not appropriate, IMO, for younger kids.  In one episode (I think ""Diesel's Devious Deeds""), Diesel basically makes fun of Duck (another engine) for the entire thing, harassing him, etc., and never apologizies, never learns a lesson, etc.  It's just negativity the entire thing.  Newer Thomas shows try to impart some kind of constructive lesson.  I'm all for mindless entertainment too, but for 4-5 yr old set, it has to at least be positive or neutral, not affirmatively malicious!  Some of the other episodes are cute (and ""spooky"" which my son actually likes), but it's hit or miss.  FUN FACT:  many of this era's episodes are narrated by either Alec Baldwin (hilarious once you know it's him) or even more ironically, GEORGE CARLIN.  ""Picture"" the voice of the 7 Dirty Words narrating a Thomas episode!  Priceless!",1376956800,4,945,4.8930817610062896

2591792,3,B000FUTV2I,"I was dissapointed when my son received this DVD as it didn't have some episodes I thought it would.  Why on earth would they show Emily on the front cover with Thomas (from the newer episode ""Halloween"") and not even include that episode?  It didn't have Flour Power either.  Even more misleading is that one of the reviews here lists those episodes as being on this DVD. Unfortunately that was one of the few reviews here when I put it on my son's Christmas list last fall.

While this does have some good episodes that I am happy to own on DVD, I don't understand why they made a Halloween DVD without the newer Halloween episodes and why they made such a misleading cover (Emily isn't in a single episode on this DVD).",1170806400,10,722,4.406015037593985

2591797,5,B000FUTV2I,"Recently my 20-month-old son has become a fan of trains and, specifically, of Thomas.  When I saw this DVD set, I couldn't wait to get it, because it contained pretty much all the episodes I'd been hoping to catch on TV.  Even better, it had a Halloween caboose to hook up to the wooden train we'd just gotten, and the price was great!
The caboose is very nice--attractive, and great quality.  It hooked right up to our Maxim circus train, although it does seem ever-so-slightly bigger than the Maxim cars.
The episodes are everything I'd hoped for, with lots of spooky fun as well as some castles and a Chinese dragon.  A couple of notes about the episodes:  they seem to be in a strange order, because I'm pretty sure there was a reference to Thomas thinking Percy was a ghost before the episode where that happened.  And Halloween, in one of the first episodes, seems to be a hybrid of Halloween and Guy Fawkes/Bonfire Night.  Those things don't really bother me, but I did notice.
I'd definitely recommend this collection.  It seems more spirited--pun semi-intended--than the average Thomas episode.
An additional note:  I've noticed that a Halloween episode--Flour Power--is not on the Halloween DVD, although it's available on the Tales from the Tracks DVD.
Also, there's an episode on the Halloween Adventures DVD called, I think, ""Diesel's Devilish Deed.""  Unfortunately, this segment does not have a happy ending, and the situation isn't remedied elsewhere on the DVD, so that's a bit of a bummer.  But I still highly recommend  Thomas's Halloween Adventures.",1159747200,9,1568,4.920152091254753
