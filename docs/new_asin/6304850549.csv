933993,4,6304850549,"My review is for the film itself, not the vendor I purchased from who sold me what seemed to be a blatant bootleg copy of the movie. The aspect ratio was all over the place and the film's cover looked like a cheap print from a crappy color copier.

Wheels of Meals is a wacky, goofy comedy that just so happens to feature one of Jackie Chan's all time most intense and brutal fight scenes. The action as a whole is intense and doesn't always mesh with the lighter tone of the actual story. Jackie and his costar Yuen Biao are roommates who also share a business as 1980's style food truck owners. While David (Biao) does the cooking, Thomas (Jackie) skateboards around the crowd serving up orders. They cook out of a crazy food truck that features a bizarre 80's style computer that automates all the doors (for some reason). One night the duo come across Sylvia (Lola Forner from Chan's classic Armor of God):  a pickpocket and thief who poses as a prostitute for easy marks. Both David and Thomas fall for Sylvia and take her under their collective wing, despite her thieving tendencies. Meanwhile, their Private Eye pal Moby (Sammo Hung from Chan's other classic Project A) learns that Sylvia is actually the long lost daughter of a rich tycoon who recently passed and willed his fortune to her. The rich man's family is now hunting for Sylvia hoping to use her to steal the fortune, while Moby's employer wants her to get the inheritance she's owed. This puts Chan and his pal on a collision course with the family's henchmen who kidnap Slyvia. The three pals break into the estate and take on the family's thugs to save the girl.
Craziest Shit You'll See Jackie Do:  The film is a light-hearted action comedy for the most part, but again it is now mostly remembered for the final fight between Jackie and Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez (a real life kickboxing champion). The fight scene is quite lengthy and downright brutal. Rumor has it that to make some of the slow-motion punches look more authentic, Chan and Urquidez decided to hit each other for real while packing their mouths with cotton balls for ""cushioning."" The fight scene is well worth checking out and you can find it in its entirety on Youtube, but the movie as a whole is worth checking out for fans.",1500508800,2,2267,4.578817733990148

933997,5,6304850549,"In my opinion Jackie Chan films from the late 1970's all throughout 1980's were his best. Every fan of the Kung-Fu comedy genre needs to watch Wheels on Meals (1984).  Story has it, that the title of the film which should be correctly phrased as Meals on Wheels, was changed because the superstitious Chinese producers having produced already two other films starting with the letter M, both of which were total cinematic flops;  decided to reverse the words in the title so that it would begin with the letter W instead.

Wheels on Meals was filmed entirely in Barcelona, Spain. The film is about two Chinese friends living together and working at a food-truck.  Later in the film they are joined by their third goofy-like Chinese friend, who happens to be a private detective in search of a young woman.  The three soon embark on a hilarious charade that will eventually lead them to a castle where they will have to fight it out...and save the life of the young woman in question.  The film features some amazing fight sequences and stunts...not to mention hilarious characters from a looney-bin.",1442102400,,1099,4.788359788359788

934063,2,6304850549,"I love Wheels on Meals, it's in my top 5 favorite Jackie Chan films.  It has that charming mix of comedy and action that's a signature of his work, and though it's not quite as definitive as his more well-known features (like Police Story or Rumble in the Bronx), I like it a lot for it's light-hearted, breezy feel.

But anyways.  This DVD here is very likely a bootleg, because although the only two available audio tracks are English and Cantonese (which is a Chinese dialect), for some reason, splashed all over the DVD box is the JAPANESE language title ""Spartan X"".  Even more telling, whoever manufactured these DVDs spelt and wrote the Japanese title completely wrong on the spine (they split parts of the katakana characters in places, AND they wrote it upside-down!)

My first exposure to Wheels on Meals was from a well-performed English language version that was officially available on YouTube's movie channel a number of years ago.  This DVD does not have that version --- rather, it sounds like a cast of foreign voice actors not very fluent in English attempting to produce a dub (the dialogue is very stilted, and it feels like there are heavy accents throughout).  It's not horrible, but it can be hard to understand, and it's not as good as the other dub I watched, which was disappointing.  If you're a fan of watching Jackie Chan films in the original Chinese, though, it's at least here, and sounds pretty good.

It would be great to finally get some legit quality releases of the lesser-known Jackie Chan works.",1382832000,,1534,4.7368421052631575

934105,5,6304850549,"This movie is better than anything Bruce Lee has ever done! Made in Spain, this kung fu/action movie is hilarious, filled with brilliant fight scenes, cool stunts, and is never boring. Three Asian goofballs get dragged into a Spanish family matter involving the attempted kidnapping of an heiress. Comedian, kung fu master, acrobat, stuntman, and convincing actor Jackie Chan makes it all look easy as he steals the show with his charismatic performance! Sammo Hung also directs and along with Yuen Biao help push the entertainment value to infinity! The ending delivers with the exciting martial arts match ups. Chan fights American champ Benny Urquidez in one of the greatest fights ever in kung fu movie history. Keith Vitali (revenge of the ninja, american kickboxer) kicks everyone's ass until he is outsmarted by Yuen Baio. The soundtrack (for the English dubbed version only) is brilliant 80's euro disco/rock themes that compliment all the action or anything else going on in the movie.  The dvd pictured is in Cantonese only and with alternate music sounding inapropriatly like ""rockabye baby"" during the most intense action scenes. Also exclusive to the English version are some extra funny moments not seen in the Chinese version. H.K. legends has the dub version in region 2 pal, but the way they changed the voices and music in their ""police story"" dvd, they ruined it. So I'm unsure of the definitive one to get. Beware of bootlegs. Luckily most versions are at least in widescreen. Forget anything Jackie Chan has done during this last decade (especially the rush hour movies). *Update-the bluray from Japan has the english dub version with great picture and sound quality and has no problems on U.S. players.",1363305600,,1724,5.049122807017544
934106,5,6304850549,"This is a little-known early Jackie Chan movie.

934111,5,6304850549,"Wheels On Meals may be a crazy title, but it's a part of what makes this unique.

Highlights here for me...

- Jackie & Yuen Biao on skateboards.
- Yellow convertible Mitsubishi van chase.
- Jackie vs. Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez part 1.

Lighthearted & comedic, it's not exactly a fast-paced action film, although it's sprinkled with action throughout. Set in scenic Barcelona, Spain, I absolutely love all the brief skateboarding & food catering scenes with that hi-tech in the 80's, yellow, convertible van. Jackie & Yuen Biao's skateboarding tricks are a bit basic by today's standards, but they actually do handstands while moving(!), something even pros today will say is not easy to do. Jackie would later use a snowboard in First Strike. I also love Sammo Hung's hairstyle in this- it's a real blast from the past. Sammo did a decent job directing, and he would go on to do another decent job directing Jackie as a chef in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/B000I2KOB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Nice Guy</a>&nbsp;circa 1997-'98. Notice the similar ""food theme"" in both.:)

This film's claim to fame is Jackie vs. Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez part 1. Jackie picks this '84 Wheels matchup as his personal #1 fight in his autobiography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Jackie-Chan-My-Life-in-Action/dp/0345429133/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action</a>, copyright 1998-'99, even over their rematch in Dragons Forever in '88. I currently favor this Wheels fight too, even though I usually prefer a more contemporary visual setting as a backdrop to the action. This one-on-one fight is high-energy & intense.

- on various versions- Right now this is my favorite release of this film. The picture quality is very good but non-remastered, so it isn't perfect. My copy has the front cover featuring the 3 musketeers against a plain white background. It's by Universe Laser & Video Co., Ltd., licensed by Media Asia Distribution, and it's in Chinese audio with original soundtrack, including subtitles options in many languages. The English subtitles feature good, clear & entertaining words, although they sometimes flash too quickly. It's missing the van washing scene, which I personally don't mind. I haven't yet seen any version with outtakes, although they might still be available on youtube.",1294444800,,2426,5.672176308539945
934112,3,6304850549,I love jackie chan film and all the stunts he does.  This just once again shows the dexterity of this actor.  The action was awesome the story funny and i enjoy the seen with Benny the Jet!!!,1289606400,,191,4.135135135135135

934114,5,6304850549,"Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao.... if you are a fan of their style of Martial Arts movies, then this is a must see film, if only for for the final fight scenes alone.  Sammo Hung does not use his full abilities in this movie.  Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao are the featured artists in this collaboration.  Sammo's character is used more in moving the story along than in action.

From the opening training sequence (showcasing the speed of Chan and Yuen) to the short fight against the motorcycle gang in the Square to a few more smaller fights scattered throughout the film, it all culminates in a fantastic fight sequence at the end.  Jackie Chan's biography lists this as his best fight on film.  He and Benny ""the Jet"" really deliver a hard hitting, fast paced fight.  Yuen Biao's chase/fight is to me, as entertaining and awe inspiring, if you enjoy acrobatics (but much different than your normal fight scene).

For a martial arts film the story is not too bad either.  As the Three Brothers help a young Spanish woman out of some difficult situations.

If you enjoy this movie you may also want to see ""Dragons Forever.""  Another collaboration of the Three Brothers.  It has a rematch of the fight scene between Jackie Chan and Benny ""the Jet.""  It also has Yuen Wah in a very entertaining role.",1287273600,,1306,4.577586206896552
934145,4,6304850549,"Sit back and chill to this comedic martial arts film WHEELS ON MEALS. And if you're wondering about the peculiar film title, just know that its studio, Golden Harvest, opted the superstitious route. Golden Harvest's prior two film ventures of which titles began with an ""M"" flopped horridly (MEGAFORCE and MENAGE-A-TROIS), and so instead of MEALS ON WHEELS, we get the vicy-versy. Anyway, Peking opera school alums and chums Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao star in the thing and, in my opinion, make it a really diverting viewing experience.

WHEELS ON MEALS features more breezy comedy bits than it does martial arts action, and you'll probably know within the first 15 minutes if this is your bag or not. Moments into the film, there's a neat off-handed visual gag of Yuen Biao emerging from his bedroom door and then Jackie emerging from his own bedroom door (which stands right next to Biao's door)... except you immediately notice that both doors open into the same bedroom. So I liked that quite a bit, as well as most of the gags which follow. There's a certain easygoing, offbeat tone that pervades, and for a while it feels like a series of comic episodic interludes, but wait it out. There is a plot.

The story first focuses on two young Chinese guys with the typically Chinese names of Thomas and David. Thomas and David operate a mobile fast-food service called ""Everybody's Kitchen"" (or ""Cocina Para Todos"") somewhere in Spain (Barcelona? Madrid?), and I dig that tricked out yellow van they work out of. Much of the first half hour or so centers on silly shenanigans as these two go thru one particular work day. Later on that evening they run into the beautiful pickpocket Sylvia - played by Lola Forner who would later pop up in ARMOUR OF GOD- and they end up taking her in. Not too surprisingly, Thomas (Chan) and David (Biao) are instantly smitten.

Sammo Hung directs this film, and he's good at it. But it takes some time before his character even interacts with Jackie and Biao, and maybe it's 'cause he's embarrassed of the jherri-curls he's sporting. Sammo plays a bumbling private eye named Moby who finally lands a case concerning a long missing young heiress, daughter to a count. Throw in a crew of goons working for the heiress's evil uncle who wants to ensure that the heiress touches nary a penny of her inheritance. The uncle's name is Mondale which probably accounts for his being evil.

Sammo Hung knows how to frame the jokes, and it says something about him that he good-naturedly ends up the butt of several gags (such as crashing thru an awning that Chan and Biao had previously bounced off from or, during a car chase, falling out of a hurtling van and rolling down a hillside). But, okay, the sanitarium bits are pretty ho-hum. The fights are few and far between, but you have to stick around for the last 20 minutes or so as things ramp up to rousing levels. Jackie, Sammo, and Biao storm the bad guy's castle - and, by the way, check out the fairly spectacular way Jackie scales the castle wall - and this leads up to several climactic fights, with Sammo taking on a Spanish master fencer, Yuen Biao facing off against former American karate champion Keith Vitali, and, in one of the best martial arts duel ever put to cinema, Jackie's epic showdown with the legendary Benny ""the Jet"" Urquidez. Urquidez is pretty revered by martial artists and by folks who love martial arts movies, and he's one of the few guys who can go toe to toe against Jackie and not look like an asshat. Their explosive fight resonates in much the same way as did Bruce Lee versus Chuck Norris in WAY OF THE DRAGON. I'd even venture to say that this film is worth watching just to see this fight.

About the only real downside to this film is that there aren't any bloopers during the closing credits. This particular DVD is from some distributor called Media Asia Distribution (although the back of the DVD case mentions ""Bonzai Media Corporation""), and it does offer the uncut version. According to the blurb on the back of the DVD case this version ""features the van washing scene that was cut from other DVD versions."" I haven't seen any other DVD versions so I don't know how accurate that comment is. For what it's worth, I can confirm that the van washing scene is in this DVD. The bonus features here are: a one paragraph movie synopsis; cast & credits (with bios and filmographies for Chan, Hung, and Biao); trailers for HEART OF THE DRAGON, WINNERS & SINNERS, and MY LUCKY STAR; and the 4-minute WHEELS ON MEALS theatrical trailer. This DVD also offers both Cantonese and original English language tracks, and English sub-titles.

If you can, try to get a hold of the 2-disc DVD version that's distributed by Hong Kong Legends. From what I've heard, that one has really good extra features: among other things, an in-depth Bey Logan commentary; interviews with Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Benny Urquidez, and Keith Vitali; and movie outtakes. The only downer to the Hong Kong Legends release is that, at this stage, it may still be designed solely for Region 2 viewing.

This movie has a lot of things going for it, but is so entrenched in the native quirks of its makers that anybody who's expecting a streamlined blockbuster will doubtlessly be a bit disappointed...until the last few minutes, that is.

The plot: when their affairs get tangled up with a beautiful pickpocket targeted for kidnapping (Lola Forner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Condor-2-The-Armour-of-the-Gods/dp/6305433860/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Condor 2: The Armour of the Gods</a>), cousins and co-owners of a mobile restaurant Thomas (Chan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-Hour/dp/B00004RCK9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush Hour</a>&nbsp;trilogy) and David (Biao,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prodigal-Son/dp/B0001NBMN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prodigal Son</a>) team up with their friend/foil, the private investigator Moby (Hung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winners-and-Sinners/dp/B0007IO704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winners and Sinners</a>), to protect their beautiful quarry and get to the bottom of the hostage plot.

Chances are that when you first heard of this movie, it was in connection with its awesome fight scenes, and while these won't let you down, you'll have to wait until the end of the film to get to the good ones. There are three very quick brawls and an entertaining chase scene in the first 90 minutes of the movie, but by and by, these end up feeling meager and probably won't satiate those who can't get into the flick's comedy aspects (more on that later). Luckily, the best truly were saved for last, and the three respective showdowns that cap the feature are worth waiting for. While seeing Yuen Biao and Keith Vitali (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Ninja/dp/B000092Q4V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Ninja</a>) play an acrobatic game of tag and Sammo engage Jose Sancho (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Flesh/dp/B000059H9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Flesh</a>, but actually a masked Yuen Biao) in a swordfight is as entertaining as you'd think it could get, it's Jackie's fistfight with kickboxing champ Benny Urquidez (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodmatch/dp/6302150892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodmatch</a>) that steals the show and eventually makes the movie: in a rare occurrence of Chan the martial artist besting both Chan the comedian and Chan the acrobat, this fight is easily recognizable as one of the most fast-paced, technically-sound, and brutal  encounters Jackie has ever had, and it easily ranks among his best martial offerings of all time. Prepare to be amazed.

But again, getting there means sitting through the rest of the movie, which isn't everybody's cup of tea...and no, I'm not referring to looking at Sammo's perm for an hour and a half. For starters, unless you speak Cantonese or have a DVD with better subtitles than mine, get ready for some interesting translations (e.g. ""I'm not a nut. I'm normal. Please unite me!"") which may or may not be helpful in having you understand what passes for humor in Hong Kong. The physical comedy is easy enough to understand, but like countless other films from this part of the world, flowery dialogue clouds the meaning of why a given exchange is supposed to be funny or insightful. Experienced HK fans probably won't have problems with this, but the rest of us may be tempted to fast-forward past the plot portions of the film just because it's just not very engaging for us.

Fans of all three leading stars will want to add this to their collection, but I can't rightly say that the tall price is worth it for casual fans, who can now watch the fights online for free. Definitely know yourself before purchasing!",1269302400,,4582,6.383870967741935

Wheels on Meals is one of my favorites for the action and the comedy.  The story line is not exactly the most coherent, but who cares about the plot when it comes to most Jackie Chan films?

In my opinion, this film began a run of films that featured Jackie Chan at his best.  Other films to look at include Project A, Police Story, and Drunken Master 2.  I would suggest that people get the original Hong Kong cuts of the films and not the American dubs that were released a few years ago.",1248048000,,828,4.493333333333333

This is a must-have for even the slightest Chan fan, seeing the three brothers in action together doing what they do best is unbeatable. This film has a great plot, and was filmed around the time that Chan was getting married and expecting his son, Jaycee. Benny the Jet plays a somewhat large role here, and he and Jackie show off probably the greatest/most entertaining fighting sequence ever filmed. If you only own one Jackie chan movie, this should be it.",1230422400,,586,4.754901960784314

Not as many stunts as the average Chan film, but the fights are perhaps the best in all his movies.  His fight with Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez has to be seen to be believed. Some of Sammo's best work, too.

The story, set in Spain, is one of how two workaholic Chinese (Chan and Biao) and their gormless detective friend Moby (Hung) get pulled around by the nose by a working girl/countess while trying to protect her from her evil uncle, a count, who wants to stop her inheriting what is rightfully hers.

Plenty of action, plenty of Hong Kong humour, plenty of kicking and jumping around.

934197,4,6304850549,"Being a huge fan of Jackie Chan and his films, I noticed how many positive comments people have had on this film.  But noticing it was made around 1983 in Hong Kong, I decided to not bother, since 80's HK films can be compared in quailty to 60's USA films.  Although the quailty of the movie is just that, with low picture quailty, poor sound and effects, cheesy music and that awful dubbing (if you get the English dubbed version, which this version is not), I still found a way to be lured in quickly, forgeting that all of that even existed.

Wheels on Meals is a terrific movie containing great action, stunts, chases, comedy, and a decent plot combining the famous trio of Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Biao Yuen.  The three have also appeared together in Project A and Dragons Forever.  Also in Wheels on Meals, is Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez (Dragons Forever, Bloodmatch, Kick Fighter) who displays his once again entertainingly quick fighting skills unlike no other, as seen in his other few movies.  Keith Vitali (American Kickboxer, Superfights, No Retreat No Surrender 3) also appears in Wheels on Meals, displaying some great skills as well.

Although the action throughout the movie is light until the end, I found the movie enjoyable for the most part, continuing to be entertaining and never getting boring.  The best part of the movie is the finale, which has a triple showdown - Jackie Chan vs Benny Urquidez, Biao Yuen vs Keith Vitali, and Sammo Hung vs the boss/swordsman (can't recall actor's name).  The Jackie vs Benny fight scene is truly spectacular, owning up to all the great things I have heard about it.  Definetly deserves to be in the hall of fame of all-time best Jackie Chan fight scenes.  And Benny is just awesome too.

I am really glad I bought this movie, wish I had done so sooner.  Its really cool to see an older, cheaper-made movie can still have everything that truly makes a movie worth watching - especially a Jackie Chan movie.  If you are a fan, this is a must.  The 4 stars is only because of the poorer quailty, guess I couldn't resist.",1160611200,,2079,4.611413043478261

934203,3,6304850549,"The first two-thirds of this movie lag badly because of an incredibly uneven mix of elements -- some great, some sloppy.  On one hand, whenever there's an action sequence, it is without exception top-notch.  This is countered by a distractingly rambling plot and some bad humour, and some scenes that lead absolutely nowhere (for example, when the three characters visit an insane asylum).
Wheels on Meals is still a pretty enjoyable action/comedy movie.  Jackie Chan takes on an unusual role as a lazily charming restauranteur partnered with a somewhat geeky partner (an effective Yuen Biao).  Their friend, a wannabe private detective (director Samo Hung, whose dialogue sound inexplicably dubbed, thus hindering his usual good comic sense), is looking for the heiress to a multi-million-dollar fortune and enlists their reluctant help.
The token look-don't-touch Jackie Chan heroine this time is Lola Forner, who plays a street girl with an unstoppable urge to steal.  For once, we have somebody who's not just gorgeous, but has some semblance of character to keep the typically chaste romantic interactions interesting (especially in the ending).  Forner is definitely gorgeous and has a good presence; her dialogue is unfortunately dubbed into Cantonese, but the character is stronger than usual.
The last third of the movie acquires great momentum leading up to a terrifically funny and choreographed fight scene between Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez and Jackie Chan.  Their lightning-quick battle (I suspect some shots were sped up, but not a big problem) is great to watch, and when Chan breaks out his signature comic-relief gags, it's marvellous.

The action is superb and has rarely been bettered - encorporating loads of comedy, acrobatics, and props along with some amazing moves.  As with most Chan films (i.e. excluding most of the Lo Wei movies and the rather serious ""Heart Of Dragon"") it is very funny, and contains some typically amazing stunts.
What makes it even better is that we have three stars for the price of one.  Jackie Chan stars alongside his 'brothers' Sammo Hung and Yuen Baio, and the interplay is brilliant.  Each star brings their best to this project, and it really shows.
It is directed by Sammo Hung so expect some beautifully choreographed fight scenes - especially the end battles involving kickboxing champion Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez and karate master Keith Vitali against Jackie and Yuen which are a joy to watch.  You will find yourself amazed at how action-packed and hilarious a movie can actually be!
The plot basically centres on two brothers (Jackie and Yuen) and their private-eye friend (Sammo) trying to protect a beautiful pickpocket (who is actually a wealthy heiress) from evil scheming bad guys who want the money for themselves.

When a gang of bad guys comes around, Moby and the guys foil

several attempts to kidnap Sylvia, who it turns out is the illegitimate daughter of a rich count, recently deceased. The count's brother Mondale wants her dead within 14 days in order to collect the inheritance. After Sylvia and her mother are snatched and spirited away to Mondale's castle, the

three heroes sneak in, battle Mondale's fighters, and save the day.

Barcelona seems to be about two blocks square, judging by the number of times characters accidentally run into one another. Coincidence is in fact the driving force of the plot, as the unevenly paced film lurches through countless mood shifts and diversions including a short musical interlude; two

goofy, almost slapstick visits to the mental institution; and a rather lackluster car chase which ends cleverly with the lunch wagon's accoutrements being used as weapons against the pursuers. The three lead actors, former Chinese-opera school classmates and longtime friends, play off each other

flawlessly in a series of juvenile pranks before uniting memorably in the final reel, wielding swords in unison in a nice allusion to the Three Musketeers.

Featuring an international cast (including American Herb Edelman and European model Lola Forner) and setting the action in Europe was clearly a bid for a western audience. The motorcycle gang that Chan and Yuen trounce is an exaggerated multi-ethnic cartoon, presaging the gang in Chan's US

breakthrough over a decade later, RUMBLE IN THE BRONX (1995). Using western fighters for the first time, Chan and company square off against US karate champ Keith Vitali and undefeated kickboxing champ Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez in a pair of short skirmishes part way through the film and then again

in the no-holds-barred finale. While Yuen shows off his acrobatic abilities against Vitali, Chan and stone-cold, expressionless Urqidez have an earthier, grittier showdown that s about considerably more than just punches. Magnificently filmed and edited, it clearly shows the psychology of the

fighters, trying to out-think and out-psych one another. No doubt part of the realism was due to the reputed animosity between the two actors, as ring-trained Urquidez was unschooled in pulling his punches for the camera, and more than a few blows landed for real. The undeniable power of the

scene, and the success of the film, led to Urquidez returning for a rematch with Chan in DRAGONS FOREVER (1988). He has since gone on to become a fight advisor and martial arts teacher in Hollywood.

Incidentally, the film's puzzling title is due to the failure in 1992 of the Golden Harvest films MEGAFORCE and MENAGE A TROIS. Rather than risk the curse of the letter ""M,"" the title was inverted from the original MEALS ON WHEELS. Whereas in Japan, they simply decided to connect the film with

Chan's earlier PROJECT A (1983) by retitling it SPARTAN X, adding an outtake reel that the domestic versions lack. (Violence, sexual situations.)",1522540800,,3242,5.130929791271347

It just so happens that the two cousins bumped into this girl who is now a woman, and the three of them are trying to protect her from a small mob that is trying to capture her.  The main reason for this chase is that there was once a wealthy guy who cheated with his maid that gave birth to this girl.  The rich guy was forced by his wife to kick out the maid and the girl.  The girl became an orphan and only knows to steal money from others.  The wealthy guy has no children of his own and had just passed away.  He had his butler find this illegitimate daughter to give her his assets.  However, his brother is interested in this asset and he would get the assets if the daughter doesn't show up to claim the wealth within 14 days of the wealthy guy's passing.",1522454400,,1288,4.051383399209486

7878225,3,6304850549,Movie is good but It came before Jackie chan movies were made in English or dubbed well. The dubbing is pretty bad. I would say watch a subbed version if you can find one. I think it would be better to read the English and hear the Chinese then to hear this dubbing.,1513728000,3,266,4.037735849056604
