All acted in Silent Westerns. This Movie is a reunion of Sorts. John Ford wrote this script.
He and Harry Carey developed the Serious Literal Acting style Ford told John Wayne to emulate.
The way Carey Slouched on a Horse and walked shows His influence on those who followed.

7836175,5,6303060196,"This is a review for the 1936 RKO ""B"" western, THE LAST OUTLAW, available only on VHS. The story begins as  notorious old west bank robber Dean Payton, played by Harry Carey,  is parolled after serving 25 years for his last foray into illegal bank withdrawal.  But the town he returns to,  Central City, is not the little town he left in 1910.  The current modern small city has things like cars, traffic cops and talking pictures which you aren't supposed to talk back to no matter how much the people on the screen could use your advice.

The first part of THE LAST OUTLAW deals with ex- con outlaw Dean Payton, played by Harry Carey,  getting used to the modern world of 1936 as well as finding an old friend or two and making a couple of new friends. He also makes at least one very unfriendly enemy, played by ""B"" western stalwart, Tom Tyler.

Dean Payton has also left an unknowing daughter behind who he'd like to see at least once.  The daughter is being raised by a doctor friend of his and he does meet up with them both but still keeps his secret from her.

But ultimately, THE LAST OUTLAW has Dean Payton and former sheriff Cal Yates, played by Henry B. Walthall, along with Chuck Wilson, played by Hoot Gibson, chase after some modern day bank robbers using their more effective old fashioned methods over the modernized efforts of the young, up -to- date sheriff.

All in all, this very unusual ""B""western is as entertaining as a short ""B"" film can get, with stellar performances by all of those involved.  It is ably directed by old pro Christy Cabanne and based on a
1919 film by John Ford, who is credited with part of the story.  Even though THE LAST OUTLAW is now pretty much forgotten and only available in VHS, I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in a fine film
specializing in  warm-hearted humor with an actionful finish in the ""B"" western tradition. This is a movie that will leave you with a good feeling.

I give THE LAST OUTLAW an enthusiastic five stars with great pleasure.",1280880000,,2011,4.486263736263736
7836176,5,6303060196,"This is a charming and humorous western starring Harry Carey. Among the cast is my favorite actor who was the star of 1915's Birth of a Nation, Henry B. Walthall (one of his last roles). He plays the part of former sheriff Cal Yates who has become a victim of modernization. The new sherrif, a young go-getter, has taken over the reigns and Yates is relegated to listening to complaints from old ladies. Famed bank robber Dean Payton (Harry Carey) is released from prison and seeks his old pal Yates, only to be disheartened by the many changes to the town. The best scene is where Payton and Yates are in a movie theatre and Payton encounters the talkies for the first time ""Oh, they talk now."" After the town bank is hit again by a modern band of robbers, Payton and Yates set out to capture the crooks by recreating Payton's capture 25 years earlier. Oh yes, they also must save Payton's daughter who has been kidnapped. This film has that charming Mayberry humor. The one thing that bothers me is that the murder of the doctor (the man who raised Payton's daughter) by the thugs is completely ignored. The young woman's attitude upon learning that Payton is her real father seems very odd to me. Still, The Last Outlaw is a fun movie.",1022716800,3,1238,4.506666666666667
