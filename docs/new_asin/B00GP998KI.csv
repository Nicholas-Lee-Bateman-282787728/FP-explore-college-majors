I enjoyed seeing how this team worked together to solve serious crimes. And the Scenery is mind blowing.
From this series I was able to go on and enjoy many others The Great Queen Seondeok, both Wallendar versions and Spiral!!!!
But this was the first. And I hav purchased the others but cannot find a US version of this series.",1398729600,,441,4.325301204819277

since the last group photo of the Obama administration appointees class.
Investigation? Reason? Professional law enforcement or forensic techniques?
None. Nada. And the Israelis are thought to be the terrorists and suicide bomb
planters and dealers in kiddie porn. The star learns Arabic in Gaza combating the hateful Israelis (read Jews)
in what is an undercurrent of the series. A soft anti-semitism. A Danish Arab Detective conflicted about being a softee and a hardass. He is the group shooter.and of course the head ""Eagle"" Hallgrim is a good natured dolt.
The best part is the series takes itself seriously and that makes it a satire and a fun one.
Watch it if it is cost effective for you; but do NOT go out of your way to acquire it.",1389744000,2,811,4.884057971014493
