5462418,5,B00AO05AVU,"It's a very well executed animation, this anime is base of a visual novel like a lot of harem anime but instead of mixing all the routes together each girl get a different arcs given to them so it's separated into six different stories. If you like a certain girl in one anime then you will be happy by just looking at her arc but I say this gives each heroine a lot more value than if they just mix all the routes together and you don't know why the girls like the main protagonist.",1423699200,,483,4.094736842105263
5462419,3,B00AO05AVU,"Standard high school harem fare. Boy with sad past goes to school. Boy meets girls. Girls help him overcome his past. Instead of standard ""zero in on one girl in 12 episodes"", Amagami tells the story six different ways, with six different endings. It's almost as if you were playing a dating sim and going for completeness. Each individual track is pretty much a vanilla boy-meets-girl romance. Not much drama, not much comedy. Graphics are workmanlike. Acting is OK, given what they have to work with.

I'd recommend it primarily for those who have played the game.

Six disks (650min), one for each girl. Includes two short OVAs, with surprise endings.",1422489600,,654,4.882882882882883
5462420,5,B00AO05AVU,I love this series. Though not quite as good as the first season it still comes paper thin close. Just the continuation of awesome anime.,1419811200,,137,4.52
5462421,4,B00AO05AVU,"This anime while based on a dating sim (as in licensed) does a brilliant job bringing aspects of reality to a medium that is usually filled with exaggerated and ridiculous characters.

If you're a boy who thinks there is a single, perfect, predestined girl that if you don't get your love life is over, this anime gives you a good slap of in the face of reality. That piece of reality is, there is no such thing as a singular soulmate; As this anime shows you that every girl the main character interacts with has pros and cons, and in the end you realize this as well that none of the girls are a ""perfect"" match, but the fact through condifence and compromise each of girls in their own respective arcs become his girlfriend even though they butt heads occasionally just like in reality.

That and all the girls while still adhering to a certain stereotype still aren't shallow and show personality, which is usually rare in an anime. If anything they are probably some of the closest ""actual depictions"" you will find in an anime. Ditzy girl isn't an absolute moron, Tomboy girl still has a feminine side, introverted girl actually opens up after awhile, and so on.

Also, I love an anime that breaks the fourth wall and is self-aware. Anime and J-game fans will probably find at least a few in-jokes/parodies while watching this that will make you chuckle or sometimes literally laugh out loud.

I can go on forever pretty much of all the pros this anime has, but I do agree with the first reviewer. If you want an anime that isn't action-packed but is full of warm fuzzies, you should give this anime a try.",1407542400,10,1612,4.529209621993127
5462422,4,B00AO05AVU,Ever watch a harem anime and the girl you liked the most didn't get chosen? This anime won't do that each girl gets their own arc and you get to see how her and the main character get together. The individual stories are decent. If you are looking for them most exciting anime ever this isn't it. If you are looking for a feel good light hearted anime where the girl you like gets to be the main heroine this is your anime.,1407110400,7,423,4.108433734939759
5462423,4,B00AO05AVU,Watched this series on HULU and just had to add it to my collection. You can either get this as a complete collection or get it in 2 parts.  Depends on how you want to view the story lines.,1393459200,,189,3.8461538461538463
5462424,4,B00AO05AVU,"If you enjoyed Amagami SS then youll certainly enjoy Amagami SS+ as well!  We get to peek into the lives of all our favorite characters after their relationships have been going for a while.  Clearly just because you're a couple does not mean that all your problems are solved.  Junichi still has his hands full while always managing to do the right thing.  My one complaint, if you can call it that, is that this season is half as short as the previous one being only 325 minutes long compared to the 650 of Amagami SS.  The stories are just as sweet and as heartwarming as the originals were.",1388620800,,594,4.412844036697248
5462425,4,B00AO05AVU,"For some reason those who make another year of a show do not put the same effort into following seasons that they put into the first year. There are exceptions of coarse, yet this second year while good does not have the same punch as the first year.",1368403200,,250,4.229166666666667

8555061,5,B00AO05AVU,Definitely one of the best romance animes out there considering I can be so happy at the end of every arc. In a short four episodes they can give you the emotional attachment as if it were a full 12-24 episode arc. The omnibus format is just a great way to make everyone happy. Quality is great as well.,1483228800,,303,4.1525423728813555
8555062,4,B00AO05AVU,"Fun little show, interesting take on Harem genre. The girls are all somewhat different and interplay in other arcs. Each girl has a 4 episode story, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Fun time waster.",1482796800,,207,4.777777777777778
8555063,5,B00AO05AVU,This has good anime stories,1482278400,,27,4.6
8555064,5,B00AO05AVU,It a good DVD who's like Romance and Comedy in the same time these is one for anyone to buy,1474934400,,91,3.6
8555065,5,B00AO05AVU,"There is no over the top drama plots or explosive action in this little story, or perhaps stories is the better description. Out of the six discs there are four episodes dedicated to each romance being told. You'll follow Junichi Tachibana in a different telling of his romantic life with different young women all in the same general timeframe. The voice acting is all in Japanese with English subtitles. The animation style is well done and doesn't drift away from it to dramatize a character's mood or changing atmosphere. If it did, I didn't notice. Have fun choosing which one is your favorite telling.
The basis is that Tachibana got stood up two years ago by a girl at Christmas and is still recovering from the blow. Minor changes are made to Tachibana's back story on that established history depending on which girl he is currently involved with. By interacting with each of the women in unique ways at school a romantic bond develops between the characters. They are short and sweet stories that will probably leave you wanting to see more if this sort of anime is your thing. They are all lovable characters I would enjoy seeing more of in anime media in continue with their lives. That being said, I've already purchased the squeal Amagami SS+ because I didn't get enough.",1458950400,,1285,4.741071428571429

8555069,5,B00AO05AVU,"Amagai is an anime adaptation of a visual novel series of games based off of romance choices. In this series the young protagonist is a teen who one christmas day was devastated when his potential girlfriend skips out on their meet up. Now he's a man hard pressed to find love but lucky he's in an anime that caters not to just him, but to the viewers. This series isn't 26+ continuous episodes but instead short arcs around what if scenarios. Each six or so episodes has our main man fall in love with one of several girls and when that arc ends, time rewinds (not literally, this isn't groundhogs day)  showing what if he chose this girl or that one. The stories are all really amazing, one which is meh but it's still good, and the animation is solid. Overall this is the romance story that gives fans what they want, choice which is rarely done in any anime series. I personally love this series and there is a sequel of sorts but that is more so about extra stories, it's unnecessary as these stories all have ends. Pick this up and watch romance done right,  at least in anime terms.",1432252800,3,1089,4.3861386138613865
