I strongly doubt if there ever has ever been such a marvelous and complete presentation of Country Music history put together before, and I never get tired of watching it!  After I ""re-watched"" the tape that I had owned for several years, without having watched it for a very long time, I became so enthused with it that I bought a copy of it for my former wife and one for a woman I had dated for several years afterwards. I'm sure there are many people who have no idea that the Grand Ole Opry was started in 1925, 89 YEARS AGO, and that it's the world's longest-running radio program, and it's broadcast live each and ever time! There are THREE GENERATIONS of performers on the Grand Ole Opry, and where else could anyone ever go to see something like that?! It's awesome!",1379808000,,805,4.402684563758389
