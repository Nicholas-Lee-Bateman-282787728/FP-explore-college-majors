4106483,1,B003BJO8NC,This has got to be one of the worst action-drama films that I have ever seen in my entire life. Thank god I only paid $1 for it when I bought it.,1374278400,,145,3.5625
4106484,1,B003BJO8NC,"This is possible the worst movie I have ever seen. billy zane was in the movie less than ten minutes, good actors in a vary poor movie. bad script, bad director, politically motivated left wing agenda based movie. I can not say it enough a lousy, lousy movie.",1346716800,,259,4.416666666666667
4106485,1,B003BJO8NC,"Okay, so off the bat I didn't expect much from this movie, don't get me wrong, there are some pretty good Direct to DVD releases out there such as The River Murders, Blitz and S.W.A.T. Firefight, but you go into these kinds of movies with relatively low expectations. Within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, it is plain to see that there is quite the anti-Republican sentiment going for it, pulling out all the stops with stereotype after stereotype. Now that might not be all that much of an issue to some viewers, but it was to me. Not necessarily because of political stance, but because to me it just felt rather un-needed, especially when the remainder of the movie is an absolute bore. That action sequences are barely there, and the dialogue and acting is rather uninspired. All in all I was very disappointed in this film, and consider it an utter waste of the acting talents of Billy Zane and Eric Roberts. It's not even good enough for background noise.",1345248000,2,967,4.627906976744186
4106486,2,B003BJO8NC,The movie is only 75 minutes and 43 seconds long including credits. It says on the description it is 89 minutes long. It had good actors in it but it was a little boring. The quality of the transfer to DVD is very good,1345075200,,218,3.977272727272727
4106487,1,B003BJO8NC,"Simply put: Dan Garcia SUCKS as a director!
What's up with Billy Zane (and even Eric Roberts) doing yet another
lousy film for this guy?  Are they trying to kill their careers?
Don't waste your money.",1289606400,2,200,4.555555555555555
4106488,2,B003BJO8NC,"I watched this film as research for my upcoming book, ""How To Write Conspiracy Fiction.""  I've been studying the evolution of this genre for thirty years.

""Enemies Among Us"" suffers from a bad script, but it does contain most of the elements you'd expect to find in a Conspiracy thriller.  Students of film and literature will have no trouble identifying those aspects.

The film is timely in one respect.  The subject of off shore oil drilling gets a mention early on that is almost prophetic when you stop to think about it.  All the action in this film takes place in just a few short hours.  Most of it is very specfic to Louisiana, which might be fun for residents of that State.

There are some many current cultural and political reference in this movie that I will have to add it to my collection.  I blame the script for this film's lack of potency.  it's all over the place, with story elements that you'd never miss if they hit the cutting room floor.  Even so, fans of Conspiracy fiction will enjoy the short ride.",1280793600,4,1027,4.4972972972972975
4106489,1,B003BJO8NC,"They don't allow no stars so it get's one.  I picked this movie up for rental during a dry spell of releases and regret it.  Hey, Billy Zane and Eric Roberts?  They play some pretty quirky action bad guys right?  Nope.  Not in this stinker at least

I rarely stop watching a movie before it is over but this one got tossed about 3/4 of the way through.

It must have been written by someone in the Obama fan club with a little inspiration from Karl Marx.  The idea of the movie is that big government and high taxes are all that can save us from the evil republicans.  Once you realize that is the whole idea/agenda behind the movie you don't really need to watch all the less than clever ways that they keep harping on it in this film.  The writer drags out every tired ""mean old republican"" cliche you can think of.

What a waste of some good actors who, as was pointed out by the other reviewer, are stumbling through their parts for nothing more than a paycheck",1277164800,3,965,4.247252747252747
4106490,2,B003BJO8NC,"Enemies Among Us was written, directed and produced by Dan Garcia, better known to New Orleanians as 1/2 of the former No Limit Records rap duo Kane & Abel.  I was excited and surprised to see that he was able to cast a variety of veteran actors, and was looking forward to this film.

It's bad.  While the production value is a step up from his past movies, the story and dialogue are simply awful.  There's virtually no action or fast pacing in this film, most of the movie is made of dialogue scenes that drag on forever.  The story jumps around, and the speaking scenes are painfully boring.  Add to that the Governor is being chased by the world's worst hitmen, all while being protected by someone on their first day as a state trooper (typical job for newbies, apparently).

Billy Zane is front and center on the DVD cover, but he has literally four minutes of screen time in the entire film.  Eric Roberts gets not much more screen time as a quirky state trooper.  Both he and Robin Givens give ""so where's my check"" performances.  Steven Bauer (Manolo in Scarface) isn't even credited on IMDB as having appeared in this movie, I wouldn't be surprised if it was at his agent's request.

The cinematography was decent, the lighting was good, as was the color correction.  That's really the only reason why the film is getting two stars and not one.  Otherwise it has a veteran cast that isn't used to it's potential, a terrible plot, and horrible dialogue.  This movie wasn't worth a Redbox rental, I can't imagine why anyone would actually buy the DVD.",1275523200,10,1560,4.5647482014388485

4106496,3,B003BJO8NC,"It was a little interesting, but became a propaganda style movie. Rapper uses movie instead of music to tell people what is wrong in this nation. Lousy movies today use deception to sell their movies. Famous actor is paid a lot of money for a few minutes in the movie and their face on the dvd cover to make it look like they play the main character in the movie. Cheap and unethical practices are happening in the world's businesses today. Not all are doing it fortunately.",1466726400,,474,4.459770114942529

4106499,1,B003BJO8NC,"Believe me if I could give this a minus 5 stars I would.  When I watch a movie I would like to be entertained not 90 minutes of hate propaganda from the left or right with no real plot to the movie except to portray everyone as evil.  1/4 of a what appears to be a middle easterner being tortured by Robin Givens and friends.  You do get to hear a hate tirade against the US.  What do they want to know---don't know?  What did they find out--nothing!  Toss in some waterboarding and then kill him.  Why was this in the movie--don't know?  An evil governor is almost assassinated by a hooker that he is going to get on down with before a campaign party.  He turns the tide, gets the best of her, finds out she is part of a 4 man hit team and then strangles her.  Why did he strangle her--don't know?  Why didn't he tell his guards about the hit team--don't know?  Evidently this is to show how evil he is as he bribes the two policemen on hand to show how corrupt the cops are.  Why did he just happen to have a million dollars handy in his briefcase--don't know?  Getting to see the pattern here.  The good cop (who was cheating on his wife and kids with his other female police officer)  feels he has to rush the governor from the hotel out to safety (where he gets killed) so then he can arrest him.  Just a confusing piece of garbage with no purpose at all. Badly edited.  I can't believe Billy Zane and Eric Roberts even let them put the names in the credits for their brief appearances.",1401580800,4,1491,4.171929824561404

8393674,1,B003BJO8NC,I adore good movies.  This was far from a good movie; it was horrible! I'm not sure what Eric Roberts or Billy Zane were thinking when they agreed to this waste of time. This is time I will never get back - save yourself from the misery of watching this rubbish. There should be a negative star option.,1516838400,,302,4.206896551724138
8393675,4,B003BJO8NC,Good: 16:9. Confusing: Description states 5.1 surround; I tried several things that activated the 5.1 but ended up just watching without 5.1. The story was different but too many strings.,1499385600,,187,5.266666666666667
8393676,2,B003BJO8NC,"This had to be something done to support movie business in Louisiana - several of the cast are faces that could draw business on there own.
But sadly each of these characters was poorly written & the lead love story poorly shown.
As for the underiding story lines where everyone is morally corrupt on some level, they failed by leaving to many stories open.
I am left to wonder did they think they could draw this out into a TV show or movie series.",1485648000,,449,4.357142857142857
