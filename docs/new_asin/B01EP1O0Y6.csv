8759315,5,B01EP1O0Y6,"Ryo Machiko is a talented cook, but since the death of her grandmother the food does not taste the same.  But when her second cousin arrives to start cram school and live with her during the weekends, she begins to realize that only with those you care about can bring out not only the best of food but of life as well.

This series was a enjoyable little story of a lonely girl who opens up.  Of course it centers around cooking and eating food (and the eating scenes are just so over the top its funny) and the bonds she makes with others.  I would recommend it for those who need a light life story.",1461715200,5,602,4.163793103448276
