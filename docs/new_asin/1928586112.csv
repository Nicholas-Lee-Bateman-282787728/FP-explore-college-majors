7801238,5,1928586112,"I'm a BIG fan of researching Quantum Physics, Spirituality and what it means to be ""Conscious."" I've been reading books from a wide range of perspectives and it just seems the more I learn, the more I want to keep learning.

Who/What am I?

I purchased the DVD of this 23 min. video ""used"" from Amazon.com and finally watched it last night.

Although I had never heard of Peter Russell before, I was was browsing through Amazon's ""recommendations"" presented to me and was intrigued by the title of the DVD. Half concerned that it might be a Christian religious treatment on ""creationism"" I overrode that ""feeling"" and went with my intuition that it was truly more about ""consciousness"", a subject matter that has held great fascination for me for a while now. Peter presents the concepts quite clearly in a down-to-earth manner, along with great videography and graphics ( la ""What the Bleep?""), and explores the deep essence of who/what we truly are. By the end of the DVD I was elated I had picked it up and want to share it with everyone I know. It puts together exactly how I view reality and what it means to be conscious. Hang on tight 'cause if you haven't peered beyond the veil before, Peter surely does an awesome job of showing you exactly HOW to do it and WHAT that really means! My only regret about the DVD is that it was too short! :-) I wanted it to keep going deeper, but it does do a good job of setting the stage for further personal research.

I intend to explore more of Peter's work now that I have been given a glimpse into his own mind.

Another DVD set I picked up last year (also on Amazon.com) is simply called ""CONSCIOUSNESS"" and features ""talking head"" interviews with some of the top minds in the latest study of the mind and psychology from a wide variety of perspectives (from the intellectual to the spiritual). 20 scientists, 12 hours, 6 DVDs. I love this set, too.

I recommend both ""From Science to God"" and for a deeper/broader perspective, ""CONSCIOUSNESS"" if you are interested in exploring ""consciousness"" and the ""awakening"" process.

Namaste,
