2890816,3,B000SUHODS,"Mystery Classics V.14

This is a collection of mystery movies from the 1930s-1940s. They entertained Americans during the Great Depression and World War II, when most people went to the movies every week. Some of these Public Domain movies are found in other sets, such as the 50 Pack series. They are all worth watching in themselves and to learn about the culture of that era. Few people today remember milk delivery by a milkman, but can remember public telephone booths. Statistics say murders are caused by greed or lust. Here is a short description of each movie and its year.

2890818,5,B000SUHODS,"Mystery Classics are usually movies from the 30s and 40s. They've been improved, but occasionally a flaw will show itself. I like the old movies because they are well acted, don't depend on CGI to build the story, and blood is almost non-existant in most of the films. Most of the films are easy to watch and allow the viewer to let their imaginations out for some exercise. These films are good for the entire family. They don't contain bad language, adult scenes, or gratuitous violence. Actually, most of the violence takes place off stage or in shadow. I can recommend all the Mystery Classics collections since I have most of them.",1395705600,6,636,4.6875
