8532577,2,B008YLSC34,"Very ""fair"" copy of a favorite of mine. Wanted it to be great... (Copy Wise) Not so... Indifferent dubbing and no original Italian Soundtrack. If I did not want this movie so much, I would have returned it. ""The Big Gun Down"" was like this until recently. They issued a new Blu Ray Edition. That was wonderful. Hoping this movie has a similar fate.",1399852800,,348,4.453125

FACE TO FACE is often praised as being an excellent Spaghetti Western and I'm inclined to agree.  The narrative for this Sergio Sollima directed film is a cut above the rest. After an ailing professor, (Gian Maria Volonte) moves to Texas for it's therapeutic warm climate he is abducted by an outlaw (Tomas Milian.)  Over the course of the story we see the moralities switch between the two diametrically opposed characters.  Volonte, who is a gentle intellectual, becomes violently ruthless and takes over the gang while Milan loses interest in killing and violence.  As the two go through their adventures they are pursued by a Detective, (William Berger.) A three-way showdown between the three takes place at the film's climax.  I believe the character arc of the two leads, who point out each other's differences, thus causing life altering changes in each of them, is one of the highlights of this film. Another highlight is one of the themes in the film, that points out how brutality can be ironically justified and accepted when in occurs in large organized forces.  The political themes and character development give the film a quality and essence to it that one doesn't always find in the Euro Western genre and help make FACE TO FACE a film worth watching.

What is unfortunate is that the import copy I purchased & viewed through Amazon is not an excellent quality copy.  The full-screen print is somewhat blurry.  In addition, this is an abridged version, which has about 15 minutes cut from the original 107 minute length version.  A large part of the two protagonist's relationship development is missing because of these cuts, which then makes it less clear as to how and why these two men influenced one another.  A couple of shoot outs have also been omitted on the version I viewed.  Overall, I rate the original film with 5 out of 5 stars, but the ""SPECTRA NOVA"" DVD, (an import that has Spanish & Portuguese subtitles with a running time of 93 minutes) that I purchased, I Rate with 3 out of 5 stars.",1381708800,3,2133,4.779291553133515
