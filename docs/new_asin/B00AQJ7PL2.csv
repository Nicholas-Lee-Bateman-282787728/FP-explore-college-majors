5471227,3,B00AQJ7PL2,"Yes, it's another ""Regular Show"" DVD release with a random assortment of 16 episodes like ""High Score"" (Rigby and Mordecai attempt to beat a video game high score by all means.) ""Skips Strikes"" (Skips becomes the gang's biggest asset in their bowling team but can they make to the championships ?), ""Free Cake"" (The duo want some chocolate cake and as luck would have it, the gang is throwing a birthday party for Skips who has secretive other plans.), and ""Party Pete"" (Our crazy pair want to host their own party, so they seek for some help.).  Also, there's another character gallery as the special feature.

Whether or not you'll get this or do have it with the two previous releases, buck up, buckos.  And that's because the complete first AND second seasons of ""Regular Show"" is coming to DVD !  Blu-Ray, too.  And watch Cartoon Network for lots of brand-new episodes in which the series has reached over 100 episodes (Who knew ?).",1371340800,3,937,4.689024390243903
5471228,4,B00AQJ7PL2,"I don't feel the need to go into details about the content or substance of Regular Show. If you're a fan you know what you're buying and have probably seen at least most of these episodes. I also don't feel the need to whine like a child about full season releases; get them on amazon instant, itunes or wait for the BluRay release this summer!

I own all three of the RS DVD releases, and this one fits right in with the rest. Video quality is good, the menus are on top of some fun episode stills or specially made backgrounds from the artists (the Cheezer's tabletop is a fun one). The episode selection is very good, some of my favorites are Party Pete, Fuzzy Dice and High Score. There is one special feature; a character profile menu which is similar to the one featured on ""The Best DVD in the World"" which frankly is barely worth your time, this DVD is about having the episodes on disk, nothing more.

I only have two complaints. For some reason the subtitles are set on by default, this is true for ""Best DVD"" as well, at least on the players I have used. Has anyone else experienced this problem? It's easily fixed, but come on! How is this even an issue with a major DVD release! I also wish there were just a few more episodes, maybe make it an even 20? But for 12 bucks, it can slide (I wouldn't pay full retail).

So...What you see is what you get. 16 episodes, no frills. For $12, if you're a fan or need a budget level gift for a fan go ahead and pick it up! Great show, lots of fun!",1364947200,3,1500,4.1833910034602075
5471229,5,B00AQJ7PL2,Love The Show and these dvd releases but I hope the next will be a full season release. Hopefully a blu-ray version!,1363046400,,116,4.318181818181818
5471230,5,B00AQJ7PL2,"Ok, I'm not a big fan of how Cartoon Network is releasing Regular Show on DVD. I agree with everyone else, give us full seasons on disc. please. But I love this show too much, so even if they continue to release the episodes like this, I'll continue to buy them. If you love the show as much as I do, go ahead and get Party Pack. The menu is really cool, I have to give credit to CN that this is an improvement over the 2 previous DVDs. What I mean is the episode selection, menu is nice and so on. 5 stars in my book. It will make you laugh.",1362441600,,542,3.8482142857142856
5471231,3,B00AQJ7PL2,"Perhaps Warners figures we're all streaming complete seasons of THE REGULAR SHOW by now, and that releasing them on disc is just redundant. That would be pretty damn ironic for a show that's all about obsessive retro tastes in everything from music and game technology to the vintage 1984 ""sodas"" that our heroes get hammered on in ""Party Pete."" (Soda. Yeah.)

Anyway, here's yet another single disc, random episode, super lame release of sixteen episodes from the funniest animated show on television. Thanks for the craptastic marketing, Warners.",1361923200,,548,5.2272727272727275
5471232,1,B00AQJ7PL2,"I would like to express my disappointment in Cartoon Networks insatiable greed.  I love certain programs like Adventure Time.  However, I am outraged on how there are now, not one, but five random selections of episodes out on DVD.  I will take time out of my day to make sure reviews on all websites that sell these partial seasons will clearly tell people how CN is driven by greed and not to buy these mixed seasons and not to support partial season DVDs.  You can put crap in a shiny box and call it a favor, but it is still crap.  So many customers demand full seasons ONLY!  You may fool the average house mom, but with a little education, my fellow peers will have their eyes opened to CN's deceit of its customers and insatiable greed.  What ever happened to producing quality products?  What ever happened to companies that didn't try to gouge the customer and fool them into thinking they are getting a good deal?  The DVD's cost you way less than a dollar to produce, but yet you want to try and fool the common customer to buy these mixed seasons of wonderful shows. Sadly, taking care of the customer and offering quality products appears to be a thing of the past.

Please don't hack up the dream works dragons of Burke when you put those seasons out on DVD.  I will follow the releases and also educate the average customer on your business tactics and lack of general ethics.  My voice will be heard, if not by CN, but by the average consumer.

I don't normally complain, but I am sick and tired of large companies scamming and price gouging the loyal fans for the sake of a few extra bucks.  America is no longer a producer of quality, now it seems we are a producer of deception and greed.  You should be ASHAMED CARTOON NETWORK!",1361664000,3,1747,4.415625
5471233,3,B00AQJ7PL2,"It just doesn't make sense how Adventure Time got a Season 1 release after it's 2nd volume and Regular Show doesn't. I really hope the next Regular Show DVD is a season release. If it isn't, I'm just going to give up and buy these compilations since I really want to add Regular Show to my DVD collection.",1359590400,,305,4.275862068965517
5471234,5,B00AQJ7PL2,"Regular show is a great show.  I would immediately buy full seasons, but they are not available.  If cartoon network keeps this up, I will have to do like EVERYONE else and watch them for free on bootleg websites.  You guys are losing soooo much money releasing these chopped up DVD's.",1357862400,7,285,4.549019607843137
5471235,4,B00AQJ7PL2,"I love Regular Show and I'm glad to see it on dvd. But these little random episode deals are getting old. I,along with tons of other people, want a complete season!",1356912000,21,164,4.32258064516129
5471236,1,B00AQJ7PL2,"This is just such a fantastic show, as is Adventure Time, yet BOTH shows suffer from random bunched up episodes contained in crappy volume DVDs! It's about time these two shows get full season releases like they deserve! Adventure Time already has season 1 out, and I thought Regular Show would follow the same formula, but it seems like they changed their minds or something. There better be a season release soon, and a SECOND season release for Adventure Time, because I'm NOT wasting my money on ANOTHER volume set. Cartoon Network... GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER AND DELIVER TO US WHAT WE WANT!",1356652800,26,593,4.766990291262136
