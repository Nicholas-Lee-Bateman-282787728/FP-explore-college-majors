7851937,4,6303626947,"A delightful musical, reminisent of ""Fiddler on The Roof"", based on the ancient Jewish rituals that dictate courting behavior and anticipation of the wedding night. On a deeper level, it's the story Jesus uses to define His relationship with His Church. He is our Bridegroom, and we, the Church are His Bride, waiting in the night for Him to come for us. Steeped in history, the traditions of Judaism are beautifully presented in words, music, and the narration of Zola Levitt as he explains the significance of the parable of the Bride & Groom.",1122854400,2,545,4.808510638297872
