8707638,5,B00UNO0CLA,The holy Land Rosary is a great asset to the rest of my Religious DVDs.  The only problem I have with it is that they seem to say the rosary as though the devil is chasing them. (They say is rather fast).,1517184000,,204,3.857142857142857

8707642,5,B00UNO0CLA,"This made me incredibly happy!!! I really feel like I am in the Holy Land, especially with Fr. Mitch explaining what we were seeing. It feels good to be praying along with others, too.

Most importantly, I no longer have to DVR the episodes, which were never labeled correctly on EWTN. Now I can pray with Fr. Mitch whenever I want, with no fear of loosing or need to hunt down the episode.",1457308800,2,390,4.342465753424658
