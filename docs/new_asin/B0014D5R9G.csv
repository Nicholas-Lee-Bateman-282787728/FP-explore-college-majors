3129603,5,B0014D5R9G,"i've seen this picture three times. it's an independent film. i couldn't shut off this movie any one of the three times. five women are working nite shift in small restaurant in london. the acting is so good, all five equally good.
a cook a dishwasher, waitress bartender and manager. it is one of the funniest movies i have seen. the dialogue is great, the situations are funny.
all the characters are really good. i liked shirley henderson who had to work as cook. she is so so funny. it is so very enjoyable.

3129605,3,B0014D5R9G,"Back in the giddy Nineties I would have thought this was an artsy production but here at the end of the less impressionable Tens I found this to be an unpleasant movie, which means it succeeded in what it was supposed to be. Effectively conveying the miseries of a stressfully repetitive job, this film plodded through an hour and a half of mostly complaints and nagging and conveyed how awful working in a trendy little restaurant can be. While two of the staff at this unnamed Soho cafe slogged through in mature fashion, Neve Campbell's endlessly rude and self-pitying ""birthday gal"" character really wore me out fast. Never before on film have sweaty kitchen personnel and bored, job-loathing wait staff been portrayed like this, which doesn't always make for a nice viewing experience. If you need to, see I Really Hate My Job for the bizarre and oft-Googled nude scene, because frankly there isn't a lot else to give you a bang for your buck. If you do manage to sit through ninety minutes of would-be artists, actresses and writers wishing they were almost anyplace but where they are, well, you've earned the right to look at Julia Salinger's past-prime hangers.

Four stars for good performances, two stars for plot, about negative five stars for enjoyability.",1261526400,2,1269,4.875
3129606,2,B0014D5R9G,"Personally, I found this movie rather boring.  It's got it's moments and there are a few laughs.  Basically, it's about a typical night at a little restaurant in England and how each of the women deal with working there instead of whatever they really want to do.  The main selling part is that Neve Campbell performs a really nice nude scene toward the end of the movie.  I doubt that I would have watched this movie if it weren't for that scene and I'm not sure if I will watch it again.",1242777600,7,489,4.282608695652174
3129607,5,B0014D5R9G,"At first, I purchased ""I Really Hate My Job"" on dvd because Neve Campbell was in it. Neve Cambell, upon watching this movie, is only one of five great actresses in it. (She is the fortunate one on the cover though.) All of the actresses able and effectively carry their own weight and add a very special something to the roles which they wholeheartedly make their own.

The movie is very well-written, so much so that I found myself watching it again immediately after my first viewing wanting to catch the subtle nuances that I may have missed the first time around.

""I Really Hate My Job"" centers around five women working in the same restaurant. It takes place on one night and gives ample attention to each of the characters.

Without giving much away, I need to say that if you like well-written movies and great acting, and want to be pleasurably surprised, then, by all means, get this movie.

SPOILER ALERT: Neve Campell, who previously refused to do a nude scene in ""Wild Things"" is featured topless at the end of this film.",1219536000,15,1034,4.572972972972973
3129608,5,B0014D5R9G,"This is a delightful and interesting independent film, shot within the confines of a small restaurant in the district of Soho, in London, England. It's a look at the varied and diverse lives of the staff - the manager, the bartender (Neve Campbell), the server, the cook and the dishwasher; all of whom happen to be women. As the film progresses, the viewers learns more about each of the women and their lives away from the restaurant.

A number of mini crises occur throughout the evening, which help propel the story along, including a late reservation made for actor Danny Huston and his party.  One of the members of the Huston dinner party is actor Barry Morse (of ""The Fugitive"" TV series and author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remember-with-Advantages/dp/078642771X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remember with Advantages</a>) in his final film role. He plays the character of 'Georg' - an Eastern European percussionist.

I found the movie to be quite a lot of fun, touching in a few spots and funny in many others. There are standout performances from both Neve Campbell and Oana Pellea, who is a new discovery for me. She plays Rita, the dishwasher. Oana is an actress to look out for!  Let me hasten to say that this movie is not full of special effects, car chases, and other such events - this is a character piece. And quite a good one, at that.  I do recommend this film.",1212537600,13,1433,5.055084745762712

8255218,3,B0014D5R9G,"This movie turned out differently than I expected.  I thought there would be more to it instead of it just taking place in a restaurant.  I love Neve Campbell, but sadly the other girls were hard to understand at times because they have accents and whisper a lot.  In order to like this movie, you really need to be in the mood to hear about several stories at once and how they go back and forth between the characters.  In case you were wondering about seeing Neve Campbell naked, yes, you do get to see her completely naked, but the camera doesn't show her naked the entire time that she is.  That's probably the only reason why I didn't give this movie 1 star.  I didn't hate it, but didn't love it either.  I think I'll watch this movie a couple more times to see if I can like it better the 2nd or 3rd time around.  I suggest you rent before you buy, but the choice is yours.",1513036800,,881,4.171597633136095
8255219,3,B0014D5R9G,I'm sorry but i have to say it. this movie sucked. It was very boring. Thank god i only paid a penny for it. I gave it away to somebody else. Not worth watching. I love Neve Campbell in the Scream movies. But this movie was a waste of time. But I'm sure she did this movie just for the paycheck.,1458950400,,295,3.8524590163934427

8255222,5,B0014D5R9G,"I bought this dvd since Neve Campbell was in this movie. The movie is about two waitresses, one cook, and dishwasher. All played by women in England in a seafood restaurant near the docks. They all say they hate their job so much. Neve finally protests by coming out naked into the restaurant. She screams that if anyone has a problem with her being naked the customers could leave. Most did and some stayed. It's a good movie to watch.",1405728000,,436,4.4625
8255223,5,B0014D5R9G,Super seller! Neve is the best....One of my best collections! Thank you very much for such a priceless DVD with a fraction of the cost...,1379721600,,137,4.52
8255224,1,B0014D5R9G,"I'm a huge fan of Neve Campbell, but this movie was a complete mess. It was really boring and Neve was the only one who could act in the movie. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this.",1346716800,3,185,3.8947368421052633
8255225,5,B0014D5R9G,I love this movie and it's pretty funny. My most favorite part of the movie is when Neve Campbell gets fed up with her hard job so she takes off her clothes and runs in the cafeteria butt naked in front of over 75 people and complains about her hard boring job and saying her credit card bill is too high and it's very funny when she says this restaurant is a rat infested piece of shit place and it's funny when some guy whistles at her naked body. She has a nice body and I love seeing her naked and seeing her boobies. I love this movie and it's makes me laugh so hard especially seeing the part where she gets naked and by the way her boobs look I think they're natural. It's funny seeing Neve Campbell naked. I'd so love to have seen her naked in the scream movies. She was so hot on the first scream.,1343606400,,806,4.04375
8255226,5,B0014D5R9G,"Loved everything about it! i will recomend this to anyone in the food service profession. we have all had a job that we took just for the money and hated almost every minute of it. this movie shows the all female cast in perfect disfunction and chaos. why? because its their job. and thats why i love it. WATCH THIS MOVIE and the next time you go out to eat you will realise that the poeple hard at work with a smile on their face are people too. they have feelings. they are there to serve you so take it easy on them.

Every one of the cast member s are totally awesome. Neve was the reason i was the reason i ordered this DVD but the story was written flawlessly and the pace didn't drag. 5 stars.",1313107200,,700,4.072463768115942
