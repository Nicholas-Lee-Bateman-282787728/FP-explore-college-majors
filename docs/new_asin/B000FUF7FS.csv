8142653,5,B000FUF7FS,"5 stars overall - Great amount of content for low price.

I'll rate each one but at almost 9 hours for about $20 you really can't go wrong unless you just flat out hate the Playboy style videos.  I def. prefer their more ""soft-core"" playful approach myself.  I had the 1st 5 on video & stopped collecting so this was  new material &  update for me.

WW1 - 3.75 stars:  4 clips of Gianna Amore are enough for me to like it a lot.  5 clips with Lynn Austin, 4 with Monique Noel, & 3 with Rebecca Armstrong (some same clips of course) keep it good.  Easily the highest playmate count of most any playboy video I've seen which means many are brief.  The more ""traditional"" clips are the better ones partly because of the above names being in them.  I'm glad they put the names in the clips for the most part.  Wish they kept that tradition.

WW2 - 3 stars:  AKA the Deborah Driggs show as she's in over  the clips for those who really like her.  Rebecca Armstrong, Ava Fabian, & Karen Foster are each in about 1/3 of the clips.  Tawni Cable, Lisa Matthews, Kerri Kendall, Petra Verkiak, & Teri Weigel are each in about 1 clip.

WW3 - 4 stars: AKA the Rebecca Ferratti show as she's in over  the clips.  Wendy Kaye & Kerri Kendall are in 3 each & easily make Wet & Wild a Go Go the best clip.  Corinna Harney, Rebecca Armstrong, & Eloise Broady are each in 4-5 clips.  Ava Fabian, Deborah Driggs, Karen Foster, Jacqueline Sheen, Renee Tenison, Petra Verkiak, & Brittany York are in 2-3 each.  Pam Anderson & Diana Lee are each in 1 clip.

WW4 - 3.5 stars:  The social studies clip starring Tanya Beyer is easily the best clip.  Beyer is in about 4 clips overall but somehow that's the only really good one.  Corinna Harney is in 5 clips which is good.  Julie Clark, Wendy Hamilton, & Brittany York are in 4 each.  Rebecca Ferratti & Wendy Kaye are in 3 each.  Cady Cantrell, Samantha Doorman, Morgan Fox, Amanda Hope, Angela Melini, & Christy Thom round out the cast at 2 clips each.

WW5 - 3 stars:  3 clips with guys getting real familiar with the ladies isn't what I buy Playboy DVD's for.  There were some good scenes to counter that though.  Tiffany Sloane, Corinna Harney, & Wendy Hamilton are each in about 5 clips.  Jennifer Lavoie, Lisa Sheridan, Christina Leardini, Angela Melini, Kimberly Donley, Samantha Doorman, Teri Doss, Rebecca Ferratti, & Morgan Fox round out the cast 1-2 clips each.

The Locker Room - 4 stars:  I counted Tawni Cable in 3 clips, Tiffany Sloane in 4 clips, Shae Marks in 4 clips, Carrie Westcott & Barbara Moore in 3 each including the opening where you see Jenny McCarthy who's not listed in the credits, Corina Harney in 3 clips, & Julie Cialini in 2 as what I call a good line-up.  Wendy Hamilton is in 4 & Fawna McLauren is in two.  Not my favorites but there were so many I did like that it was a very solid feature for me.

Hot Holidays - 3.25 stars:  With Cindy Brown in 4 clips, Julie Cialini in 4, Shae Marks in 5, & Carrie Westcott in 4 or 5; this should've been great & it did start out great; but a boring Donna Perry clip, guys with Shae Marks & Cindy Brown, & too many extras in another scene in the 2nd half brought that good start to a crashing halt ... at least that's my opinion.

Bottoms Up - 3 stars:  There wasn't a single clip or girl that completely captured my interest (Echo & Lavoi came close) in this one & as a face, hair, breast guy the gimmick didn't do it for me either.  The playmate list is Angel Boris, Maria Checa, Danielle Folta, Victoria Fuller, Anna Marie Goddard, Tylin John, Echo Johnson, Jennifer Lavoi, Jessica Lee, Rachel Jean Marteen, & Stacy Sanchez.

Slippery When Wet - 4 stars: 4 clips of Nicole Lenz & 3 each of Shannon Stewart, Summer Altice, Brooke Berry, & Sydney Moon provide some very nice highlights for this one.  Neferteri Shepherd, Kristi Cline, Natalie Sokolova, Jamie Farrell, Layla Roberts, & Jennifer Rovero round out the cast list.

Backstage Pass - 4.5 stars:  Part of me thinks every Playboy video should be like this.  No story, just good constant shots of the girls & when they get naked they pretty much stay that way.  I gotta say Antoinette Abbot alone makes this one worth it.  I wasn't a Dita Von Tease fan before this but she was fantastic.  Shannon Stewart also stands out among the best here.  It's almost too bad Sydney Moon didn't get a whole clip to herself because she was fine.  There really aren't any boring ones on it at all.",1276128000,,4439,4.348780487804878
8142654,4,B000FUF7FS,"The ""Wet and Wild"" series is one of Playboy Video's best, and gathering so many of the productions in a low-cost edition like this one is excellent. Must have for Playboy collectors.",1259971200,,182,4.71875
8142655,5,B000FUF7FS,I am a hudge fan of WnW series. I purchased used for less than half list price. Great deal for me.,1244246400,,98,3.7142857142857144
8142656,5,B000FUF7FS,"This is a very nice collection, especially if you were old enough to see the first few episodes on VHS. I was glad they were rereleased on DVD.

A word of warning though. The first DVD is pretty vintage. Therefore, it is much less racy than the others. If you weren't watching the videos back then, you might not enjoy disk one.

I think most people will like the other two disks though. Really, the collection is worthwhile for ""Slippery when Wet"". It was worthwhile for me to get ""Wet and Wild behind the Scenes"", since I was having difficulty getting that DVD. Not that the DVD is great or anything, but it does have Shannon Stewart on it.

Obviously, you have to like Playboy videos to like this. I think this is an incredible deal to get the entire collection in one package, even if disk 1 is too vintage for you.

They have changed the original music on some of the videos, but I doubt that matters to most people.",1232409600,,921,4.337209302325581
8142657,5,B000FUF7FS,"I was a little leery when I saw the title, because I thought, ""What do we need wet women for? Why can't they just be dry?"" But, actually, it was great, and for 8 hours, the price can't be beat.
  I thought it would take more than a week to view all 10 chapters, but I cruised through all 8 hours & 10 chapters in about 27 hours.
  These are collections of mini music videos, usually about 10 - 15, in each of these 10 chapters. Some of these mini music videos are better than others, but one thing consistently of the highest quality is the women. These are some of the prettiest & most beautiful women that mankind has ever seen and that mankind will ever see. Most seem to be natural; and, after hours and hours of viewing, I didn't especially notice any tatoos until Dripping Delight, which is the 2nd mini music video in ""Wet & Wild IX, Slippery When Wet.""
  ""Wet & Wild,I"" has a lot of so-so to awful music, but the music noticably improves in ""Wet & Wild, II"". I actually turned up the volume for the first time to hear the music for Liquid Sensations, which is the 7th music video on ""Wet & Wild, II"".
  The first music video that I liked so much that I pressed the repeat button-- and that I liked the best during all 8 hours of viewing-- was Party Time, the 12th music video on ""Wet & Wild, III"". Party Time seems to be an actual music video to an actual song. People drive up to a juke box in a dry lake bed, put a quarter in and dance up a storm. Another video on ""Wet & Wild, III"" that I appreciated was Fun In the Sun, where a few babes are in see-through one-piece swimsuits, but those ""swimsuits"" are probably actually teddies. See, each of those girls is wearing a teddy.
  The best intro to any of these 10 chapters is the intro to ""Wet & Wild, IV"", and the fantastic sight & sound continues on ""Wet & Wild, IV"" with the first music video Nautical But Nice, with naked females on board ship. The video Fluid Forms and the video White Rain are also notable on ""Wet & Wild, IV"", with Enigma-esque music to White Rain.
  The video Water Rites on ""Wet & Wild, V"" is perhaps notable for the male/female action, as it has about the most explicit sex scenes between a male and female in all 10 chapters. And more of the most explicit sex scenes  continue on ""Wet & Wild, V"" with Afternoon Engagement.
  A lot of these videos have a playful, surrealistic quality, where people, things, and physical properties of place magically appear, change, disappear, etc. as in  Defrosted, which is in chapter VI. Guys are in a bar watching girls in bikinis on a color tv. The girls toss buckets of water at the camera, and the water passes through the space/time continuum, and the guys at the bar get wet! Then the girls magically appear in the bar, strip out of their bikinis, and everybody gets showered with water from an unseen water source. It's silly and wacky, but it's sexy and fun, I guess. A lot of the videos are like that.
  The picture quality dramatically improves with ""Wet & Wild, IX, Slippery When Wet"". Playboy must have been using the best in new video equipment then. While the picture quality improves, the videos themselves aren't especially any better.
  ""Wet & Wild Live, Backstage Pass"", which is the 10th & last of the 10 chapters, was a disappointment, although I liked Sydney Moon. She was one of my most favorite females during all 8 hours. At that ""Wet & Wild Live, Backstage Pass"" people mostly just took a video camera backstage at a Playboy activity in Las Vegas.
  One concept that Playboy overworks too much is the one where a woman squirts a fluid from a plastic squeeze bottle on to another women and then the woman lightly applies it to her. Playboy ought to give that concept a rest. When they squirt that stuff on each other, the women tend not to touch the really sensitive parts of each other.
  If you're looking to start with a Playboy DVD, or  to increase your Playboy DVD collection, or if you are  just looking for good value for the money, Playboy: Wet & Wild: Complete Collection is the DVD for you.",1218758400,5,4048,4.342629482071713
8142658,2,B000FUF7FS,"Although the girls are beautiful and sexy, I thought the description of the movie was more ""girl on girl"" soft-core. All the girls do is pose.  I am very disappointed.",1164585600,6,167,4.566666666666666
8142659,5,B000FUF7FS,"In 3 DVDs , for a very good price, you can watch the complete series of Playboy Wet & Wild : 10 titles, some unavailable, from 1989 to 2002.

These titles, in my opinion, are among the best of Playboy (a must for PB collectors): the playmates, as usual, are gorgeous, but there is a richness of cheerfulness, innocence, joie de vivre, lacking in more recent Playboy productions.",1156204800,18,378,4.5588235294117645
