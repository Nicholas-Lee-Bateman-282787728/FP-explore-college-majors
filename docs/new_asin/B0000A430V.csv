8548943,4,B0000A430V,"An excellent documentary examining an eccentric and talented performer who has transformed himself through his art.  Feeling himself to be a stranger in a strange land due to his multi-ethnic background, Thoth has created an ideal fantasy world  to counter the racist realities he experienced at the hands of others when he was a child.
