Imagine that your grandmother has just passed away and your family is cleaning out her apartment. Amidst all the stuff your grandmother has collected, you find a tantalizing and shocking newspaper article involving your grandparents that you never heard about before from any other family member including your mother. This is essentially the set-up for 'The Flat', a fascinating new documentary by Israeli filmmaker Arnon Goldfinger.

Goldfinger's grandparents, Gerda and Kurt Tuchler, were German Jews who emigrated to Palestine (now Israel) in 1936 after the Nazis forced them out. The article was from a virulent Nazi newspaper, Der Angriff, from 1934, which chronicles a trip made by a high Nazi official, Leopold von Mildenstein, to Palestine. The article features photos of Mildenstein traveling to Palestine with Goldfinger's grandparents.

The mystery is not only why this SS man would go to Palestine with two Jews but why Goldfinger's grandparents would accompany him. Furthermore, Goldfinger discovers that his grandparents visited Mildenstein in Germany AFTER World War II numerous times and kept up a friendship with him and his wife.

The documentary brings out the fact that in 1934 the Nazi policy of 'The Final Solution' (i.e. the extermination of the Jewish people) had not been developed and there was some consideration of deporting German Jews to Palestine. Mildenstein apparently was on a scouting mission to see if deportation was a feasible solution to the ""Jewish Question"". Mildenstein actually headed the SS Office of Jewish Affairs prior to it being taken over by the infamous Adolph Eichmann. Clips from Eichmann's 1961 trial in Israel are shown along with transcripts from the trial indicating that Eichmann considered Mildenstein as an ""expert"" on Jewish affairs and that he was basically his mentor! Nonetheless, Mildenstein, apparently was not a racialist and privately had no problems socializing with Jewish people. The Tuchlers may not have been aware of Mildenstein's Nazi affiliations and were simply glad a non-Jewish German would strike up a friendship with them.

After Mildenstein's replacement at the Office of Jewish Affairs in 1937, his movements in Germany up until the end of the war were largely unknown. Goldfinger flies to Germany and meets up with Mildenstein's daughter, Edda, who firmly believed that her father was no longer affiliated with the Nazis during the war. Goldfinger seeks out a retired journalist who wrote about Mildenstein during the 1960s when he had become an executive for Coca-Cola. Although the former SS officer was mentioned during the Eichmann trial, his reputation wasn't tarnished as it was believed (as the retired reporter pointed out), that his affiliation with the Nazis had ended in 1937, when he was replaced by Eichmann. During the war (as Mildenstein's daughter's husband indicates) Mildenstein was believed to be a mere 'journalist'.

The plot thickens when Goldfinger finds Mildenstein's wartime file in records located in the former East Germany, which were not available to journalists back in the 60s. Goldfinger discovers that Mildenstein was actually promoted as an official in Goebbal's propaganda ministry and worked there for the rest of the war. Goldfinger confronts Mildenstein's daughter with the new information about her father and she appears reluctant to believe what Goldfinger is telling her. Even after she shows her a copy of her father's resume indicating his Nazi affiliations during the war, it is obvious that she's now quite uncomfortable dealing with these new revelations.

As for Goldfinger's grandparents, he interviews an expert on German Jewish history who points out that the Tuchlers obviously were not aware of Mildenstein's Nazi wartime activities. They were also willing to forgive him for any past Nazi associations, due to their past friendship with him. Despite being Jewish, the Tuchlers never learned Hebrew while in Israel and continued to speak German. They continued to identify with German culture in spite of the Holocaust and that's why they visited Germany many times after the war.

For the most part, 'The Flat' is riveting--only the ending proves to be slightly awkward. As Goldfinger and his mother walk through an old German Jewish cemetery in Germany, they search for the grave of his great-grandfather. Goldfinger unnecessarily berates his mother for not taking more of an interest in her parents when they were alive in order to find out more about their history. Apparently, his grandparents were as complicit as the mother in not revealing information about their time living in Germany and their association with Mildenstein. The mother concedes she should have taken more of an interest in the family history but when she was younger, we have to believe her that she simply had no interest at that time.

'The Flat' brings to the fore more revelations regarding issues of guilt and responsibility of ordinary Germans vis--vis the Holocaust. By the same token, it chronicles conflicting feelings on the part of those German Jews who survived. 'The Flat' plays out like a detective mystery, with its talented creator cast in the role of high stakes super sleuth!",1352246400,35,5250,5.28537170263789

It is a documentary about one grandson trying to find out why.
The previews of this film were engrossing enough for me to buy it.
Unfortunately, the previews were the best part.
The answer eludes the grandson and his family, and the filmed interviews with the Nazi's daughter and his own Israeli relatives offer no greater insight, other than that people wished to not know. Goldfinger's discussions about this with his mother revealed that she had no interest in it, either.
It made me wonder what all the fuss over this film winning awards was about.
It seems overly long, especially when it came to cleaning out his grandmother's apartment. Those sequences could have been deleted in their entirety as they added nothing to the film.

5376174,4,B00A2H9RUA,"Even today, new stories about the Holocaust rise up out of the ashes and demand to be told. Each voice is worthy, every story worth telling. And some are more interesting than others.

THE FLAT is certainly interesting, even important. But it falls short of being the compelling experience the filmmaker hoped it to be. The reason for this, in this reviewers opinion, is that there is no pay off. Granted, this is a documentary, where there are no guarantees as to the outcome of the story. One simply jumps in and hopes for the best. Arnon Goldfinger mustve made a hasty decision to pursue his grandparents relationship with a high ranking Nazi and his wife when he discovered evidence of their friendship while going through his recently deceased grandmothers belongings in her flat. (If it wasn't a hasty decision, then that would mean the footage of his family going through his grandmothers belongings was staged).

It is difficult to understand the myriad of emotions he and his family must have felt at this revelation, but clearly, at least for Goldfinger, the stakes are high, even if his family members reactions to various memorabilia are, for the most part, subdued.

One cant help suspect that as events unfold the filmmaker was hoping for some catharsis to take place: either his mother breaking down and screaming how could they? or the daughter of the grandparents Nazi friend shrieking it cant be true! This is a reasonable hope, for therein lies the stuff of good drama.

Sadly, for the sake of the documentary, this does not occur. Goldfinger voices his disappointment with his mothers guarded reaction (she knew nothing about this relationship), but the rest of the time he looks dazed, as if he cannot believe no one is expressing outrage.

Perhaps a more objective perspective on the part of the filmmaker mightve served the story better; something the best documentaries seem to have in common.

THE FLAT is, to be frank, a little flat, dramatically. It still deserves to be seen, however, as yet another valid documentation of an unusual offshoot of the Holocaust.",1397433600,,2088,4.90084985835694

The movie gets you involved early on, presenting a mystery that never completely gets resolved.  But ""The Flat"" is really more about the reaction of people to a potentially horrific situation in their ancestors' pasts than about resolving anything.  Some of the family members are eager to resolve the mystery, while others seem not to want to know the resolution.

The movie's depiction of what happens when older people die with a lot of stuff is perfect.  The movie is weaker in that the presence of the camera is likely to have distorted some of the reactions we see.  I got the sense that it also wanted us to come to stronger conclusions about what happened in the past than I think is justified by the evidence.

In the end, it is a movie that will make you think.  You will wonder about how much you know about your own family, and how much your grandparents and parents have volunteered about their history.  And you will wonder how much you want to know, and why.",1394928000,,1103,4.615384615384615

5376184,5,B00A2H9RUA,"The Flat is a 2011 Israeli feature documentary film written and directed by Arnon Goldfinger. It was theatrically released in Israel in September 2011.

No discernible blood or gore. A self-effacing, even meek, film-maker protagonist at its forefront. A host of polite on-screen characters and to all appearances, a mild mannered family drama.
So why is The Flat one of the ghastliest films ever made?
Adjunctive to the horrific devastation of the Holocaust, the film plumbs the depths of a shocking counterpart, human denial, the pathetic desire to attain normalcy at all costs
The film opens as the director, Goldfinger and members of his family gather in the apartment of his mother's mother, Gerda Tuchler, who having lived in the apartment for 70 years with her husband Kurt, had left Nazi Germany in the 1930s to emigrate to Palestine.
Goldfinger and his memory-averse family members come to discover that his grandparents held and would not ever relinquish their close personal relationship with a monster: The highly placed Nazi official, Leopold von Mildenstein, who not only headed the SS office for Jewish affairs prior to Adolph Eichmann, but had hired and mentored the same Eichmann, architect of the death of six million Jews. When not working closely with Eichmann, von Mildenstein, a close associate of Joseph Goebbels in the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda was a prominent ideologue within the Nazi brain trust.
Culturally akin, the Tuchlers and von Mildenstein couples were travel companions (to Palestine in fact), intimate correspondents before but astonishingly also after the war. This, all in the face of damning testimony yielded up by Eichmann at his widely viewed Jerusalem trial about the criminal activities of von Mildenstein. Caught up in a parallel of willful denial is von Mildensteins erudite, England-educated daughter, who in the face of all available facts clings to a fiction that her father, a prosperous Coca-Cola executive after the war was ever only reluctantly, a Nazi.
Speaking for myself, the films main action takes place in the viewers mind where a s***storm of questions about these four deceased individuals rages:

Were the Tuchlers all-along, unwittingly pets of the von Mildensteins, Nazis so highly placed that their association with Jews served as cachet enhancement? Did the Tuchlers serve as a convenient laboratory for von Mildensteins study of a people in whose subsequent exile and extermination he was deeply invested? Was von Mildenstein early on, cynical enough to recognize that in the event of a German defeat, his friendship with the Tuchlers could toggle into something magical, street cred for a usefully pristine, de-Nazified persona, Jew-tolerating German? An executive Coca Cola could barefacedly brandish in front of its soft-drink guzzling public?
As for the Tuchlers, one might envision conversations between Gerda and Kurt commencing: Ach, lets take care not to mention mothers deportation when the von Mildensteins join us for dinner. We mustnt embarrass our good friends! But what were they really thinking and who wants to go there?
(Disclaimer: the reviewers ill-disguised emotionality is rooted in a recent discovery that within his own family, a beloved and much revered figure, the authors Godfather is none other than the imprisoned cult leader Charles Manson )

My perspective is born out of spending countless hours with victims of spiritual and social holocaust.  This film requires a cognitive commitment to become involved and develop your own conclusions.  At the end you have insights and more questions than answers about friendships surviving deceptive-evil times.  It is a window into the gray shades of nationalistic ties with a youthful love of what was.  There are multiple intersections between Germans and Jews who were ""Good Germans"",  with their respective homes.  The truthful relationships are extraordinary, you can see real pain at the intersection of what happened and mystified faces of adult children left with unexplained history.  The documentary nears the end metaphorically in the cemetery with discussion around the mother's denial, over lost (or destroyed/stolen) grave stones, under the divinely choreographed weeping rain.  Evil comes to lie, deceive, destroy and create chaos for power.

The WWII holocaust is one of many in historical context, over the span of history more Jews have died than any other ""God Awing-Fearing"" people group.  But they are not alone in history.  To bring about the ""Communist Utopia"" estimates of ""Mass killings ... during twentieth century ... numbering between 85 and 100 million."" see Mass killings under Communist regimes Wikipedia.  Killing of innocent people for religious ideals (including the religions of Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism) is nothing new.  The current ""Islamic Utopianism"" (supported by governments, and unsupported by the general Islamic population under the same governments) is busy killing many people of all faiths including their own.

This documentary is less about the holocaust and more about two couples surviving evil, one of the couples missing the homeland of their youth, retaining a friendship that denies or surpasses evil and all the while being ""good Germans"" which is a moral standard.  As a psychologist, it left my head spinning.  I don't think Mildenstein was evil or sinister, like so many collateral victims of evil he was trying to get through.  Evil people jump at the chance for more power and responsibility to due evil.  Mildenstein moved away (my Adlerian view) from evil in 1937.  The psychologist in the film offered Arnon an interesting yet unsupportable synopsis.

Spoiler Alert - Don't read further until after watching the film.  Comments and more questions are welcomed.  Questions for the viewer: Did Mildenstein foresee what was coming and knowing Jews loved Germany (like the Tuchlers) save their lives by forced expulsion?  Was Mildenstein and/or Tuchler spies?  Why did they initiate their friendship after the war?  Was Mildenstein playing the party to protect more Jews?  Did he seek to escape direct involvement in fascist activities in 1937?  What did he bring to Coca-Cola that other candidates for employment couldn't?  At the end why are the gravestones missing?

For those who are unaware of what the Final Solution was, it was the Nazi operation that annihilated 6,000,000  Jewish European people and 1,000,000 Roma and Sinti people (Gypsies), among others. So, for a Jewish person to have been friends with the alleged mastermind of this operation, it might be considered a monstrosity. But human beings are filled with contradictions. The documentary is a very human and uncomfortable (at times) but nevertheless riveting journey into the silence that surrounded this friendship on the Jewish side, and the intentional or accidental silence about the Nazi past on the German family. The film was lovingly and beautifully shot. Outstanding.",1388793600,,1025,5.174698795180723

5376196,2,B00A2H9RUA,"First I'll state that I'm not Jewish, but I am certainly sympathetic and sickened by atrocity suffered upon them by a bigoted world and the Nazi regime especially.

This is a documentary made by a middle aged Israeli fellow begins with the death of his maternal grand mother and the dispensing of the contents left behind by his departed grand parents.  Mysteries are discovered as he and his siblings and mother begin to clear out the apartment shared by his grand parents for 50 years.  Discoveries that begin to reveal things that were understandably disturbing for him and his family.

Unfortunately he decides to impose his discoveries on the child of the questionable, probably sinister people his grand parents had been friends with.  What made his actions despicable in my opinion was that he sought out his discoveries under the guise of developing a friendship with this person.  He knew way more about the subject of his inquiries than he let unto her and almost tormented her by slowly revealing that her parents particularly her father, were, most likely, monsters.  This is where he lost my admiration for his truth seeking and gained my disrespect in it's place. Turns out, most of his questions were easily answered through public records and archives.  He did not need to continue the ruse of friendship after his initial contact, yet he continues it and it's torture like consequences when he could have simply moved on and let this apparently innocent and guileless elderly woman be.  Like he wanted to punish her for the sins of her parents.

This film became so muddled I'm not sure what the ambition of the filmmaker was, but I'm assuming, my disrespect for his work, was not his goal.

Based simply on the overall quality of the films pace and composition I'd probably have given it 3 stars, but based for it's lack of moral conscience I gave it 2 stars.",1388534400,8,1877,4.780185758513932

This man was the commander of Adolph Eichmann. Arnon decides to find out what was the relationship of his grandparents with the Nazis. His interviews with the descendants of the Nazi and with his own family and their reactions are interesting. Among much else, the Germans tell him that no German knew about the concentration camps and the word Nazi was never used until after the war. The Nazi friend of Arnon's grandparent's family claimed he was only a newspaperman. When Arnon showed the German family proof of his guilt, they did not want to accept it.

5376212,4,B00A2H9RUA,"I enjoyed this film, though it was also painful to watch. I speak Hebrew fluently, which allowed me to catch nuances English language only viewers might miss--especially from the filmmaker's mother, Chana, who is both compassionate and, like many Israeli Jews of her generation, especially those with ""yekke"" parents (German Jews), self-protective and deeply ambivalent about the journey her son insists on taking. To her credit, she accompanies him, and for me, the heart of the story lay in that mother/son relationship and the journey, which despite many revelations, contains mysteries that cannot be answered; all the players (the Jewish Kuchlers and the German couple with whom they continued a warm social relationship after the war) are gone by the time the Kuchler's grandson begins his quest to understand the relationship between the two couples.

I disagree with some of the reviewers' take on the filmmaker's interaction with the German daughter of the filmmaker's grandparents' Nazi friend. I don't think he was trying to shame the daughter, but rather, telling the truth mattered, and although he appreciated her welcoming him and his mother into her home, what he found was fact, which he chose not to whitewash. When we're talking about something as brutal as genocide, and complicity or active involvement in that genocide, truth trumps the niceties of social interaction. I've spent time in Berlin, and when I was a kid in Israel, had close German non-Jewish friends whose families likely historically included Nazis, and what mattered to me was that we talked truthfully about the past. It's not about shaming people who weren't even born during the Nazi era (which the daughter in fact was, albeit a very young child during that time), but at least for me, there cannot be any real healing without first coming to terms with what happened, including, in this case, the fact that a man the Jewish filmmaker's grandparents loved, and who called himself ""the Jews' best friend,"" was in fact, a perpetrator of war crimes who denied the less savory parts of his past.

The story spoke to me on other levels as well--about memory and identity, about love and the ways we approach the stories and people that make us who we are, what we keep (in every sense--just see the overwhelming collections unearthed in the titular apartment), and what we choose to ignore about our lives and the people we hold dear. In some ways, the two older women, Chana and Edda (sp?), are what interested me most here. Both of them are the inheritors of their parents' legacies, literally and figuratively, and neither asked the real questions until the filmmaker insisted on following the mystery of the friendship between their respective parents.

A compelling story, deeply felt by this viewer. Recommended, especially if you can tolerate that not all mysteries are meant to be solved entirely. This is not a Hollywood or Hallmark drama about the Holocaust, but a man's search to understand his family's journey. The facts can be researched, and certain long-held secrets revealed, but the why and how of the human heart often remain clouded by all that is left unsaid, the questions never asked.",1379721600,35,3194,5.022641509433963

5376221,5,B00A2H9RUA,"A large family is cleaning up an apartment in Tel Aviv where a 98 old grandmother died after having lived in the same place for 70 years. This woman (she was 28 at that time) and her husband moved here in 1936 from Germany, just in time to escape the deportation and the catastrophy that followed. The 12 grandchildren all adults now, giggle when they find old books in German (Who wants to read Gothe or Heine these days???) and old clothes - the grandma evidently never threw away anything. Hundreds of garbage bags go out and then they find a pile of old German newspapers with photos of this couple in their twenties accompanying their friends on a tour of Palestine in 1933. It turns out that their close friend was a NAZI functioner who after the tour wrote 12 favorable articles about Palestine in the paper promoting an idea that German Jews could resettle in Palestine and find their happiness there - and of course to free Germany of their presence. This version was later changed to a different ""solution"" for the Jews.

None of the family had any idea about the grandmother and grandfather's past. They did not know that the two couples kept in touch and even traveled together after the war despite of what happened with the Jewish population in Europe, the family did not even know that their great-grandmother perished in Treblinka. This remarkable story is the subject of this impressive documentary produced by one of the grandsons of this woman. But the movie is not just about the rich and unusual past, it is also about a total disinterest of the next generation about the life that their parents and grandparents lived, about their feelings which they never shared with their children, never talked about it and never showed them the papers, the letters, the photos. Not once! The woman and her husband shared some of their story with the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, but not with their children. And even when all this is discovered, the mother of the film director Arnon Goldfinger says that none of this bothers her. And the son asks a question that could be the key to why this movie is so important and actually maybe why it was made: ""Does not it bother you that it does not bother you?""
Very serious aspect and lesson of this movie is closing the missing link between generations.",1376179200,4,2310,4.647921760391198

5376227,4,B00A2H9RUA,"Contains a spoiler!

I watched this fascinating film last night on my Kindle. I was unsure for most of the film if it were a documentary or an actual work of fiction disguised as a documentary. Anyway the story is a gripping real life mystery and Mr. Goldfinger is unrelenting in discovering the past lives of his Grandparents and their unusual relationship with the Mildensteins in Germany.

His Grandparents never fully acclimatized to life in Israel. They never bothered to learn Hebrew and continued to identify themselves as Germans. This was confirmed by the contents of the flat. Therefore the relationship with the Mildensteins (for me anyway) was a continuation of this desire.  They completely overlooked his Nazi activities in an effort to remain in touch with a way of former way of life albeit through rose tinted spectacles.

It was very apparent Mr. Goldfinger's Mother was very reticent to speak of her parents past and appeared to know more than she was prepared to admit. So to the Mildensteins Daughter.

I take great issue with the way Mr. Goldfinger literally bashed Mildenstein's Daughter over the head with proof of her Father's wartime activities. He was completely callous and it never seemed to occur to him that Germans with past Nazi family association still suffer, even today, great shame. The woman was visibly distressed and he just stood there - judge and jury. I've met Germans with similar stories and I can tell you of the great burden of shame they continually carry. It was as if he was blaming her in some way, yet it seems his Grandparents were the ones eager to continue the friendship.

5376270,4,B00A2H9RUA,"This was a very thought-provoking film exploring the relationship of the filmmaker's grandparents (Jews) with a Nazi couple who were fairly high up in Hitler's regime. Most shockingly, this relationship continued even after the war, although the Jewish grandparents kept it quiet from their children (the Nazis, interestingly, didn't). The filmmaker discovers the decades-long friendship only after his grandmother's death and tries to figure what was behind the couples' enduring connection. I didn't mind that the end of the film was open with many unresolved questions, but it was rather too abrupt in my opinion. However, that is a tiny flaw in an otherwise very well-done film.",1371081600,2,682,5.383177570093458
5376281,5,B00A2H9RUA,"This was a very interesting story that brought to my mind some questions. Did Middlestein , an associate of Adolf Eichman, successfully avoid the Neuremberg trials and keep up the facade by keeping on the surface a friendship with an Israeli German Jew unwitting to the role that Middlestein had in the war? Were there not any Germans during the war that were willing to oppose Hitlers final solution even Germans who had close relationships with Jewish friends and neighbors and shared the same meals? Today Germany the country and Israel are allies , and Germany has made a true effort at reconciliation and that has to be commended.  Yet, for a true reconciliation between Jews and Germans to happen, the past can't be swept under the carpet because that will mean the Germans did not really learn the lessons of their past even though they might be atoning for them in a collective way. As my father was a holocaust survivor from Germany who came to the USA , he never held a true malice to the German people even though his immediate family were sacrificed. He still enjoyed German food , language , and culture as did many of my German family relatives who survived, so I can totally understand the needs of the German Israeli grandfather and grandmother to travel to Germany, a country they loved but was betrayed them.  In my book "" Leaving Home, Going Home,Returning Home: A Hebrew American's Sojourn in the land of Israel"" I myself also talk about my own visits to Germany and my encounters with young German's who to my surprise treated me very very well. I also saw this in the heart felt greetings the Israeli family had by the German families in the movie. Yet, it is time for Germans to deal completely with their past honestly for themselves and not live in denial- so that what happened in Germany can really never ever happen again. I understand that it might be painful to dig up the not so distant past. Yet, the Holocaust was painful too and will be with the Jewish people for generations to come.",1370995200,5,2018,4.602777777777778

5376284,4,B00A2H9RUA,"Movie started out well, as you see the hidden secrets that a grandson unfolds, but sadly the ending would keep you hanging, it does not continue to a conclusion, which is sad so it'll keep you wondering about how should leave things un said or continue and be afraid that the past might hurt us & for the rest of the family!!! Interesting!!!",1370736000,,341,4.428571428571429

5376288,3,B00A2H9RUA,"It was promoted kind of like a great mystery, but I did not feel there was much of one revealed.  I found it very awkward when Mr. Goldfinger pursued finding more information on the German woman's father.  I guess I felt that was her journey to explore if she so chose, not his to impose upon her.  But it was still a fine documentary with an interesting perspective.  I especially enjoyed his mother's reaction to his research and interest in the topic.  There were a few interviews that were quite good and touching.",1369699200,9,518,4.526881720430108
5376289,4,B00A2H9RUA,"This documentary film starts with a seemingly banal story about an elderly grandmother having passed away in Israel and how family and friends go through the contents of the apartment . This part is done with appropriate level of humor but then a sinister secret unfolds. The grandparents connection and friendship with a notorious Nazi official intimately connected with ""the final solution of the Jewish problem"" and the Holocaust during WW II.
The story, the level of documentation, the characters and the filming are superb.
This is an intelligent and compelling story filmed in a sensitive and technically excellent manner.
Highly recommend to anyone interested in the period.",1368835200,5,681,5.314814814814815
5376290,5,B00A2H9RUA,"An excellent movie about what happens in war. There are surprises everywhere, and no one seems to be who you thought they were.  I couldn't tear myself away from it, and plan to watch it again, as there is so much in the movie to digest.  I was surprised at how uninterested his mother seemed to be about what went on with her parents.  As several of these kinds of films have said, it is the 3rd generation that is asking all questions.  As in our own family the aunts and uncles still alive say they just never asked questions about their family history.  Hopefully we can do a better a job.",1368489600,2,593,4.258928571428571
5376291,5,B00A2H9RUA,"On the surface, this is a well-crafted documentary that describes a process of discovery that the director goes through after accidentally encountering new (and sometimes disturbing) insights into his own family's history.  As the movie progresses, a broader theme of intergenerational communication (or lack thereof) takes over and generates thought and questions long after the movie ends.",1368489600,3,391,5.859649122807017
5376292,2,B00A2H9RUA,"Was tiresome waiting for the ""narration"" arriving at the next interesting point.

5376293,4,B00A2H9RUA,"This documentary certainly held my interest.  What could be more shocking than finding out that your Jewish grandparents, who survived the Holocaust, remained life-long friends with a powerful Nazi insider who was a high-ranking officer in the department of propaganda?  I found their daughter's complete disinterest and disconnect from all her parent's history both disturbing and baffling. Don't expect a neatly wrapped up ending.

With the perspective of the third generation after the Holocaust, this offers a unique and poignant perspective.",1366243200,,407,4.985294117647059
5376297,5,B00A2H9RUA,"They say the greatest trick the devil ever played was to make one believe it did not exist.  I don't know if that's true, but what is true is that maybe as creatures, we are unable to detect it using even our imaginations.  Even our minds that are faster than light and time cannot really catch it.  Why?  cause we were designed that way, so we can go on with our own lives and live with ourselves.  The how of the Holocaust is understandable...how can people stand by and let it happen?  easily, trust me.  The what is a whole other matter.
