8047838,5,B0007KY7WK,Two classic GUNSMOKE episodes from early 1970 on vhs tape. Original poackaging and shrink wrap. Due to the age of the tape it was necessary to give it a wind and rewind treatment so tape would run best. Surprisingly crisp picture and sound. And at about 50 minutes per episode much better than the 43 minute versions on TV Land and youtube. Thumbs up for vhs and complete versions of classic tv.,1376438400,,395,4.5
