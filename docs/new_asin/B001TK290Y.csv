I'm a Technology Education teacher (construction, manufacturing, communication, transportation, and engineering) and this is something I wanted to show in each of my classes so that students can see what an imaginative and problem solving world we continue to live in.  In my opinion,this video is not just for tourists but also for 9imaginative and creative students.... and I use it that way.  The price is right for my pocket too (since I buy most everything like this from my own pocket).  A video produced professionally for education is anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes long and costs between $80 and $100.  I can't afford that.  Since Lowe's and Menard's no longer sell ""How to...."" videos, products on Amazon fill in fine.",1382832000,,780,4.871212121212121
