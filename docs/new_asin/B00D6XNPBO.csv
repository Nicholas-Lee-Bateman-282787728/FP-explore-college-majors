Luckily, I found a website that listed what episodes were included in a collection of DVD's. I purchased this DVD for one episode alone: Special Effects Ultra Dora-Man ().

In this episode, based on volume 20 of the manga, Doraemon's friends were given space suits to wear. Suneo was in charge of using the Dress-up Camera gadget to dress up the other people. Nobita was dressed up the way he should, but when it was Shizuka's turn, Suneo dressed her up in a leotard! What makes it even better is that Shizuka was smiling for a moment when she wore said leotard. This caused Shizuka to get mad at Suneo, and chased him around until he corrected her outfit.
