Don't think this is just another kids go into the woods and get tortured movie, they add various different things to keep it interesting, unique, and gory as possible.  If you want a fun to watch horror movie filled with gore and suspense, here's a good movie for you.",1334188800,5,302,4.472727272727273
5020023,1,B006UKX8VM,"The cover of this DVD is very misleading. The blonde is NOT in the movie and the scene on the cover never happens. This is yet ANOTHER of these gay S&M torture flicks masquerading as a movie that supposedly has mostly women victims in order to rip off the traditional horror crowd who, let's face it, likes to see women in peril. Some say it's because of misogyny but it's probably because men and women BOTH care more about what happens to women in horror movies than men. This movie is very politically correct. The emphasis is on humiliating, torturing and murdering men, while scenes involving women in danger are very brief. These rip-offs have been popping up quite a bit lately as these politically correct moviemakers use sneaky tactics like this to try to sell their movie to a mostly male audience (who are usually looking for horror movies with women in danger), while avoiding the situation of actually depicting in the movie itself the politically incorrect imagery in their advertisements. If you like the lurid DVD cover here you will most likely hate the actual movie.",1333670400,9,1084,4.7712765957446805
5020024,1,B006UKX8VM,"I'm sorry, but this really is a lame, stupid movie.  Nothing new.  Stupid people go camping in backwoods of Arkansas and run into twisted inbreds who capture and torture them...",1333411200,2,177,4.866666666666666
5020025,4,B006UKX8VM,"I didn't have high hopes for this film because of some reviews that said the violence was mostly off screen and I thought ,ok that means no budget for effects.
I was pleasantly surprised and totally enthralled in this backwoods slasher/basher flick. I say basher because a lot of the violence has more to do with bashing peoples faces in that slashing them up.

Some of the acting was really really great and some was not bad.
If you were to take Red State combine it with Deliverance and toss in a little Timber falls you would get something like this but this had it's own flavor and stood on it's own.

The violence is fast' hard and in your face, no holds barred and no one is off limits,It is very bloody and the effects are good old fashioned makeup effects and not CGI,Very realistic too I must add. The camera work and film quality were amazing for a low budget film, again I was totally impressed.

Two couples go into redneck territory and have to kill in self defense and from there it's a fight for survival as the men try and save the women and vice verse.
Throw in the overly religious father whom is certain anything his family does in blessed and done in the name of God and you have a recipe for a great genre piece.",1333324800,8,1233,4.306034482758621
5020026,4,B006UKX8VM,"What makes this movie so terrifying is that all of the characters are so believable.  Four young campers wander into the hold up of a religious cult of ""southern boys"" and their mentor in backwoods Arkansas.  They are not welcome and have to fight to escape from the nightmare into which they have wandered.

I have never seen cold-blooded hate and brutality so well portrayed on screen.  The viewer can empathize with the uncontrollable desire for revenge by each camper as they get even for atrocities.

There is no explainable reason why people act this way but they clearly do and through this movie you may find yourself feeling the same way.",1332201600,8,647,4.741071428571429
5020027,2,B006UKX8VM,Torture porn. I like horror movies but this is to the Hostel side of things without as much good lead in and character development--although there was some.  I don't like torture porn and I couldn't keep watching this.,1409529600,,218,4.7368421052631575

5020030,4,B006UKX8VM,"While the basic premise (group of outsiders, out of their element, being killed off by the local ""inbreds"") is nothing new, the storyline here is convincing and rather well told.  While those hoping for blondes, nudity and graphic dismemberment of body parts are going to be disappointed, as well as those who can't sit still for more than 5 minutes without implausible CGI things going boom, those looking instead for a solidly crafted and convincingly-portrayed horror thriller of the escape genre will be well rewarded.  Even from the atmospheric shots of the opening credits, you get a hint of the danger hiding beneath the surface, and by half an hour into the movie, you've realized you've unknowingly stepped right into the middle of it.  And just when you think they're going to escape ...  I saw this movie originally a few years ago at a film festival, and it stuck with me all this time until I decided to get the DVD and watch it again.  No, it's not a major studio release with major studio funding, but it's definitely worth a look nonetheless.  Enjoy your stay in Resurrection County.",1377907200,,1099,4.757894736842105

5020033,5,B006UKX8VM,"This is a great, must see movie. Who ever married the girl in the opening credits attached to the newspaper article is one lucky guy! :)",1334966400,,136,4.269230769230769
5020034,2,B006UKX8VM,"me, at least.  To the extent that reviewers are providing detail here, I assume that the cover is misleading as is the:  Tags Customers Associate with This Product.  I assume this because no reviewer has noted female OR male nudity though there is one person (possibly someone involved with the production (why would I think that - OH!, the misleading cover (per reviewers)  ) )who pulled up the option ""abundant female nudity"".

For film producers of this type of cheap (NOT knocking yet)horror film let me suggest a reading of a book on or by Kraft-Ebbing and ""Sex and Death"" by Georges Bataille :  your audience is probably a minimum of 80% male and mostly heterosexual.
Sex and Death (my preference is nude or nearly so females kicking the feces out of the bad guy who has captured them but YMMV) are the draw.  Use it or lose.  Lie about it - gain a little once - but what you did will be covered somewhere in reviews and passed on in discussions and you will likely not get another chance to follow the Way.",1334966400,2,1013,4.467391304347826
5020035,1,B006UKX8VM,"First sign of cheap. No English subtitles for people with hearing issues and to also make up for poor audio and actor enunciation.
Second sign of cheap. Lots of intro shots of newspaper clippings about missing people. Besides boring it's a standard cheap and quick writing trick to say people are dying.
Third sign of cheap. Lots of filler time devoted to people just driving a car on a country road and driving their ATVs on dirt while just tearing up the country side for effects. Lots of filler shots of the woods for those people who have never seen a tree before.
Fourth sign of cheap. You don't see the people dying - too much money for the props and CGI. You just see them afterwards - dead.
Fifth sign of cheap. Cheap knockoff predictable storyline of campers going into an area where the locals like to kill off the tourists. Usually it's dumb obnoxious teens or young adults but in this case they are dumb obnoxious adults whose personalities so match their eventual killers that the viewer ends up not caring who lives. The same, often used, torture scenes that have been copied so many times by writers that they are now more laughable than scary.
Sixth sign of cheap. Bad acting and even worse dialogue.
Seventh sign of cheap. Some 60 plus special thanks in the credits for production freebies in producing the film so that the studio can cut costs even further.",1334620800,5,1375,4.59349593495935
5020036,5,B006UKX8VM,"This movies is he!!a cool! Do not listen to any reviews that are negative about this flic. I order alot of movies scary ones and mabey I find 1 movie out of 12 really good or good at all i was starting to give up on finding horror movies on here. I have seen alot of backwoods killer movies and none are like this. This movie keeps you going it has all the things a movie should have and it is finger nail bitting at moments like you want to go into the tv and help kick butt. The gore is perfect not to much well you can never get to much and not to little the gore was just write. This is not a b movie and after you watch it it will go on your top ten for action/thriller/American/psychology mental ride with gore that makes it a horror for the top shelf Awesome. Any bad reviews they must be board or I have know idea why mabey it was  abet and they lost all righty then, thanks for reading my review remember horror movies are not just for dorks they are also therapy for those who have had a rough tough life and need to be reminded that life is not that bad you could be the guy that does not turn around lol no pun intented",1334534400,3,1131,3.938864628820961

Maybe as a break for the trilby sporting crowd between writing screeds on ethics in gaming journalism and downvoting the new Ghostbusters, it might be entertaining.bbAnyone who rates this more than one star probably belongs on a sex offender registry.

8504567,2,B006UKX8VM,"RC for short did have a few twists that I didn't see coming that relates to the survivors (likeable to least likeable) death sequence timetables.
This story comes from the standard pool of two couples head out to the woods for some fun and relaxation. Well they get lost and end up in a ""Deliverance"" type town in need of directions to find their way back on course. After getting some wise info the gang finally find their camping area. They have the usual drama and the two guys head off on their ATV's  while the girls share some small talk. Well the guy's do it again, thats right they get lost and head onto PRIVATE ""POSTED NO TRESPASSING"" property with local backwoods boys and you know what happens next. The story lacks  any real originality and other than the twists mentioned earlier is your standard backwoods locals meets your dumb city folk in a fight to the death story.
The production values are good as was some of the acting. The direction wasn't to bad either and they had enough sense to limit the gore because of budgetary constraints. This could have been a decent movie if they would have either written a better story or chose a different story altogether and not followed this one?
There is the usual cursing including the F...word and partial nudity during the rape scenes, but no frontal nudity only from the side. It has its share of violence, but does leave some of it to the imagination of the viewer. Overall this wasn't to bad, but the sterotypical story just ruins a decent movie making production. 2.4 stars or 3.0 stars if you can forget the story.",1447459200,,1582,4.5473684210526315
8504568,3,B006UKX8VM,I just hate the fact that everybody died in the en all the good guys I mean I don't like that otherwise I would have given it 4 stars,1431907200,,133,3.6206896551724137
8504569,5,B006UKX8VM,"Resurrection County is just SICK!  All because a couple guys stumbled upon private property in the woods.  Well the gentlemen that live in these woods don't take too kindly to strangers, especially the stuffy know-it-all city type that these two men are (can't blame 'em there... just kidding!)  The city folks don't want any trouble of course, but apparently they just can't read simple signs scattered all over the forest that probably say ""Do Not Enter"" or ""Private Property"".

This must take place in the south since everyone walks out of their homes holding guns.  I guess when you're secluded long enough, any unusual noises just makes it mandatory to be sensitive to any sudden, offbeat sounds.  As sick as it sounds however, I gotta respect people who are willing to protect their property.  Not enough people would ever protect their lands so strongly like these guys do.  In that regard, there is some justice being served.

Anyway the two men and two women who rode into town looking for a little camping fun get the surprise of their lives.  While the two women are taking over campfire duties, the two men venture off on a four-wheeler adventure around the forest when, again, they meet up with one individual who's not so happy to see their arrival.  He questions what they're doing on his land.  One thing leads to another as the 80's song and old saying goes, and suddenly one of the southern boys ends up shot in the head and dead after the city folks made the mistake in believing their lives were in danger.  All because they misunderstood southern hospitality and became defensive... alright alright, actually because the southern guy wasn't being so generous and reacted violently by teasing the city guys.  The little teases are the worst!

And the one girl.  The one who was such a pretty little thing with her long brown hair.  For her troubles she had to take a bullet in the mouth so the back of her brains could be blown out.  Maybe she didn't take in the gun barrel correctly or maybe the finger slipped on the trigger.  Either way an eye for an eye as another saying goes.  The one forest guys brother dies, so does the wife of the city man.  Seems fair.  Afterwards the 3 survivors hang around (hehe) long enough to be trapped in chains and prison-like rooms while the funeral proceedings for the two southern boys who died so honorably protecting their land occurs.  Let's not forget the resurrection with pants pulled down of course, for additional humiliation.  Oh and... what a crossbow shot!  If a young group of fun-loving campfire starting kids didn't express so much disrespect maybe the entire situation could have been avoided.  Darn.  Such a pretty pregnant thing too.

Anyway Resurrection County is completely violent.  Expect blood to squirt, torture to dominate and deaths to continue while watching the movie.  And respect the land of others- that is the moral here.  So have a bowl of soup.  It'll keep you healthy for a couple days.  Get your strength back up.  Bang!",1413849600,,3014,4.732692307692307
8504570,2,B006UKX8VM,"As others have said the cover art is entirely wrong this woman is never to be found in the movie, but if that's the smallest mistake you can find then you're doing better than most. I didn't have high hopes going in but this still managed to kill them pretty much from the beginning. The acting is worse than you would expect it to be which is saying something right off the bat. The sheer poor decision making is enough to make you worry about this movie, and quite frankly Red State did the southern, religious, occultist thing much better. I will say the one thing this movie does do well is turn the ""who you expect to survive"" troupe on it's ear, you can make an educated guess from the beginning but you'll probably be wrong.",1413158400,,731,4.343065693430657
