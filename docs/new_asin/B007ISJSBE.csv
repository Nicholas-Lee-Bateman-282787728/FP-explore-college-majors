8517834,4,B007ISJSBE,"Matthew Collings is a man worth listening to, not only for his tremendously informed commentary, but his delivery, which is always dead centre between the facts and the friendly.
Here he takes on the job of explaining civilisation  and its development since its ancient origins. Boldly illuminating the essence of the ages, and tieing together its threads. I would personally say that pound for pound this series offers more insight, via its millenia straddling scope than most anything else television has come up with in years.
The only reason I deduct one star is because it presents itself as a universal overview, when it is actually a history of art view, and Collings' reading of Christianity in particular lacks a broader truth.",1522454400,,736,5.032786885245901
8517835,5,B007ISJSBE,Saw this some years ago on DirectTV and found it compelling.  Happy to have it now. The critic is brilliant and integrates the effects of art and culture across civilizations.,1388880000,,175,4.833333333333333
8517836,3,B007ISJSBE,"Content was good and interesting.  However, the striding around by the narrator was disturbing and loud if not crude in over-emphatic statements.  It almost seemed he was trying to ram it down the viewer's throat!  However, what he actually said was quite illuminating.  There is no comparison with the original ""Civilization"" by Sir Kenneth Clark., who was much more engaging, at least in my estimation.",1354492800,,404,5.1692307692307695
8517837,5,B007ISJSBE,"This show is very deep, yet it moves fast and is very entertaining. It's not DRY at all. It covers the role art playes in mirroring civilisation. (english spelling), It shows how art changed and it's purpose changed and how societies move toward comercialism removed people from the inner search. It is a intense show and it is disturbing in many ways. the last episode really captures where we are today, however as much as I enjoy the modern art , which now evidently isn't even trying to be abstract , just playful usually , it is never going to be as good to me as art of a well drawn work. It does reflect uncertainity and the chaos of a world in decay though. And it is enjoyable to view. but why can't we have many styles of art in a art show? aren't they all valid? Anyways this will stir you and make you realize that for many people consumerism has replaced religions. However there are still ideals people believe in , even in the most cynical of places like the uk. Even if we are let down by many who stand for those ideals. See, how does a art show get you thinking about so many deep things? this one will!!! this is about art though and that is a interesting story to observe. the dvd set looks outstanding as it was shot on high grade film in 2007. but the subject is timeless. What is art? how does it reflect mankind and society? You may disagree with this man's views sometimes but you will learn alot and be intrigued.",1345766400,,1439,4.274725274725275
8517838,4,B007ISJSBE,"Starts like a house afire, and draws the viewer into excellent film looks at segments of the art world. A broadcaster and abstractionist, Matthew Collings looks at civilization through the art world, aesthetics, and history. It's a bit of an update from 1969's ""Civilization"" in 13 episodes. This 2007 set is four, and the title is actually ""THIS IS CIVILISATION"" using an `S' in place of a `Z' on the film opening title segments. Correct spelling was used on the box and discs. The odd spelling mimes like a quirk that the narrator gets into in other ways on more than one occasion.

Overall it's an instructive trek, with the narrator's opinion of how history has proved to tie together civilization and visual art forms. It converges into at least 11 countries and art from Egyptian to today's popular digital images. Collings tries to show the influence of his four chosen topics, one each episode. His ideas are not always mainstream.
There is nudity, primarily in the form of fine art sculpture, paintings and photo images.
