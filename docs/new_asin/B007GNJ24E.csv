8516461,3,B007GNJ24E,"I initially bought this movie after learning that reality star Peter Madrigal of Vanderpump Rules was associated with it assumimg that it would only rate as a ""nice try"" of a movie but actually i rather enjoyed it. Aside from the fact that the videographer had a case of the ""Cloverfield"" camera shakes in even the most still of moments, the story unfolded well. Kind of put me in the mood of The Good Son or The Orphan movie, not that they were that simular but the movie revolved around problem children and one or two people bit the dust, spoiler. Seeing Peter shirtless was a bonus as well, i give it 3 stars.",1390435200,,613,4.385964912280702
