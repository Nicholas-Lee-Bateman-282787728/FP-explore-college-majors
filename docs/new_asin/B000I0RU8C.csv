8143102,2,B000I0RU8C,"I've seen a lot of living history shows. I've seen people make mistakes before in casting but never to this degree. Anna was absolutely the most horrible 14 year old I have ever seen. She did no work, contributed nothing, and would have caused the deaths of her entire family. Also, she expressed joy about watching a chicken be killed. I'm talking psychopath level creepiness. She had no place being cast on this show. This would have been a good show if not for her.",1505260800,,468,4.517647058823529
8143103,3,B000I0RU8C,"It seems unfair to give this show a 2 star rating just because the teenage girl in it was such a relentlessly whiny brat, and her father such a spineless enabler. However it really did take up a lot of the show.  So much more complaining and embarrassingly childish behavior that it felt like an American reality TV show. I suppose if Pioneer Quest or quest for the bay had children in it it might also have the same problem, however those shows were much more fun to watch because of the effort to be period realistic. Still interesting so 3 stars instead of two but the brat had way too much TV time and in 1937 her laziness would have literally killed her family...a fact brushed aside by the tv show.",1465084800,4,704,4.333333333333333

8143105,4,B000I0RU8C,"I've waited to have this become available on Amazon.  I wrote the company, no response, etc.  Finally, it's available.

This series tracks two modern families who go 'back in time' to a remote area in Newfoundland.  The area has been settled for years, but many changes have taken place.  The old way of life revolved around fishing.  That provided an excellent living for decades, but changes in the fishing stocks and the growth of corporate fishing fleets has decimated the old way of life.

This series mixes in the experiences of the families with interviews with older men and women who still remember the old ways.

As usual, there are people who really get into the swing of things, and others who just complain and moan.  The teenage girl at first really misses the mall and her friends, but seems to finally see the value of family.  One family views this as a chance to re-connect with family, with mixed results.

Overall, not the best I've seen (Pioneer Quest and Frontier House were more engaging), but definitely worthy of buying.  It would be a good watch with the whole family, since children were included in this one.",1178323200,7,1136,4.710659898477157
