7816148,4,6301805631,"While this isn't a rocket science type of western, it pays big dividends in the enjoyment of the chemistry between Borgnine and Davis. It's really a western version of a buddy cop movie. While not oscar worthy material, the plot of this made for TV short movie is engaging enough to keep even the most avid western fan happy.

It's all there, the plot filled with the usual stereotypical situations like the bar fight and the kidnapping of a young girl, the 'boxed in at the canyon' scene and even the 'can't get 'em if they cross into Mexico' scene with the cavalry. Sure it's all predictable, but Borgnine and Davis are gold to watch in anything they've done separately, so together they are platinum.

My only gripe is that it's too short. I found myself upset that it was only about 71 minutes and wanted to see more. If you really enjoy westerns and even if you don't, check out The Trackers as it's more of a western hoot than a holler.",1405209600,,942,4.4393063583815024
7816149,3,6301805631,"When a group of apparent army deserters murder his son and kidnap his daughter, rancher Sam Paxton (Ernest Borgnine) sends for his friend, a US marshall and expert tracker to help him bring the perpetrators to justice. What he gets instead, unexpectedly, is black deputy marshall Ezekial Smith (Sammy Davis Jr.). Initially reluctant to set off with the black man, Paxton eventually gives in to the pleading of his wife and leaves with Smith, the racist local sheriff, and a small posse to find his girl and bring her home.

They soon learn from Smith, the tracker, that it was indians rather than army deserters who had taken Paxton's daughter. As the pursuit heads into Mexico, Smith proves to be the only man loyal to the cause as the sheriff and posse desert the group. Paxton's racism slowly begins to melt away as he begins to realize Smith's true worth. By the end, a generally warm feeling exists between the two men.

THE TRACKERS is not great art by any stretch of the imagination. It is a made-for-TV movie produced by Aaron Spelling and directed by Earl Bellamy who is more known for directing sitcoms and other episodic TV fare. The movie even comes complete with fade-outs and musical build-ups to signal commercial breaks. Nevertheless, it is quite entertaining and even comical in parts even if it doesn't come close to THE SEARCHERS, with its similar title and background plot.
