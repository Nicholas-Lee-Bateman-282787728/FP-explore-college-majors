5124756,5,B0083QJVMQ,I enjoyed watching the series.  If you like music or if you are a musician who appreciates anime and music. i would check out K-On,1350345600,,130,4.2
5124757,5,B0083QJVMQ,"Many will agree that Azumanga Daioh (great king Azumanga) started the genre of anime about cute girls doing cute thing. While I wholeheartedly love azumanga, K-On! had made for an amazing anime which I would recommend to any and all fans, casual or otaku alike. The Light Music Club returns for their final year and has plans that surmount even the first season. My only downside is the ending. I won't spoil anything but just don't expect much until the movie is released in North America!!

My rating? 25/10 an it has definitely become a classic!",1349740800,,548,4.708333333333333
5124758,5,B0083QJVMQ,"Finally the second half has come! Though how it all describes, there will be no end for these girls! This is only the beginning of what is sure to become a great success in their road up ahead. These girls, and this band won't go down at all. K-On! Season 2 is only the next step, and who knows what will come in their future. But whatever it is, its not going to take them down without one heavy fight!",1346025600,2,403,4.05
5124759,5,B0083QJVMQ,"Sometimes music and words come together so perfectly that the combination is far more powerful than either would be alone. In much the same way, the five members of the Sakuragaoka Girl's High School's Light Music Club have become far more than just a group of girls with similar interests; more, even, than just a group of friends. Through the medium of music they've found a common course in life, and whatever the future may bring, they know they can get through it if they stand together... which makes the coming end of the school year and the graduation of the four older members something that's dreaded as much as it's looked forward to.

In the meantime, however, there's so much going on it's as life has decided to throw everything it can at them. Going to music festivals won't be hard to swing, but running a marathon? That will be a stretch! Yearbook photos? The horror! And a school play with Mio and Ritsu cast as Romeo and Juliet? Ooo, awkward. Then, of course, there's one big final performance for the band!

Contains episodes 14-27.

5124765,3,B0083QJVMQ,"Note that these discs will not play the Japanese dialogue. What's more, when you attempt to select the Japanese, English subtitles appear at the same time the English language plays. This appears to be a problem with the discs.",1366761600,3,227,4.846153846153846
5124766,5,B0083QJVMQ,"The 4 original members of the light music club are seniors, and ""Azu-nyan"" is a junior. This means that Azusa will be the only one left after this year. The band must find a way to recruit new members, but there is still a semester left before that happens. The school festival comes around. Not only does the band have to prepare for their performance, they are also all involved in a class play. Ritsu is playing Juliet, and Mio is playing Romeo.

Valentines day is also just around the corner. Azu-nyan has decided to make a chocolate cake for her beloved band members. As graduation creeps closer, emotions start to surface, and the hope of getting into the same college stresses them out. If we know one thing about the light music club, it's that they always come through in the end.

This anime is one of the cutest and most fun that I've seen. Not much actually happens in K-On. It's kind of like Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh in that there is a general premise, but no real story line. Despite it's lack of direction, the story is great. If you've seen the series up to this point, you already know this. The last couple episodes get a little emotional. The band makes a special presentation for Azu-nyan after graduation. The mood lightens up a little after that. There are a few bonus episodes about making a recruitment video and such.

The animation, voice acting and soundtrack are all good in K-On. The dialogue and detail in the animation are much better than the average series. Overall, the production quality is great. My only complaint with this series is that it's only in stereo. I don't see the point of HD if you slack on the audio as well. Other than that, this is a great series. I hope that they release the movie soon. All good things must come to an end, but who says they have to end after season 2?",1357603200,5,1829,4.4375

I have to admit it was a terrific decision I thoroughly enjoyed the anime and it was all due the the wonderful characters that make up the story line.",1354665600,,316,4.112903225806452

VIDEO:

""K-ON!"" is an anime series that is stylishly created but also features beautifully painted art backgrounds. Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 anamorphic widescreen), one thing that I love to see when it comes to anime series is the attention to detail when covering a modern setting.

A lot of TV series tend to not make the backgrounds of a city landscape so detailed and tend to put a lot of recycled trees, dirt and sky but ""K-ON!"", is not one of those anime series. There are scenes and also still images of natural settings that are beautifully painted and added to the series. There is detail for the instruments, for the desserts and I felt that with each episode, aside from the practice room and the wideshot image of their school, there was always something new being featured in terms of location. So, the color palette of the series is full of color and nothing is stale or seemed regurgitated.

With that being said, the colors are a bit saturated but for an anime TV series (which is expected) but the OVA does feature more vibrant colors and a bit more detail.

For the many decades I have watched Japanese animation, for anime series that are set in a modern Tokyo setting, I prefer anime series that focused on the smallest details, such as what is inside their bedrooms and home. What's inside the stores when they go shopping, etc. I love seeing those details instead of the typical walls or trees that are part of the banality anime TV series.

""K-ON!"" is one of those series where those little things matter and for me, those attention to small details enhanced my appreciation for the series.

AUDIO:

If there was a weak side of this Blu-ray release, I'm sure the audiophiles might be a bit cranky that the soundtrack is not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA. What you get is an English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack. What surprised me is the fact that even with the work for the English dub version, there was no change to make it a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack or to increase the bitrate for Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA. But for a Blu-ray release, those who are expecting immersive lossless audio may fret about it, while those who have been waiting for this series to come out to the U.S. will be perfectly fine with the its 2.0 lossless soundtrack.

Personally, I chose to have my receiver play the anime series with stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape. As for the voice acting, I am a bit biased to the Japanese voice acting but I did watch the series also with the English dub soundtrack and for the most part, both are well-done and the voice acting should appeal to fans who prefer their anime in Japan or English.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""K-On! Season Two, Collection 2 comes with the following special features:

  Clean Opening and Closing Animations
  Trailers - Sentai Filmworks trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Since I first began reviewing ""K-On!"" and enjoying the series a lot, playing the video games to even purchasing the ""K-On!"" Figma figures, suffice to say, I always wondered if the series would go on for several seasons before the girl's would graduate.  I just never thought that it would happen in season two.  But all things come to and end, but there is always a new beginning and this second half of ""K-On!"" is about one chapter ending, another chapter begins.

And for the Light Music Club, the music will continue.

As a fan of ""K-On!"", we have watched as Yui looked for a club to join, purchasing her first guitar, hanging out with her friends during the holiday season, sleepovers, New Year's Eve and we have seen them work hard to make their music (although, they possibly did more eating and having fun that practicing) but eventually growing their friendship and carrying the Light Music Club to new heights at Sakuragaoka Girl's High School.

I will remember Mio's fear of scary stories, I will remember Ritsu's jokes and lackadaisical approach to music and of course, who can forget Tsumugi's cheerfulness, her tea and sweets.

But here we are now with ""K-On!"" Season Two, Collection 2 and its time for Yui, Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi to graduate from high school.  And as the first half featured the girl's taking part in several events and having fun during summer vacation, this time around it's about their final activities in school.  From taking part in a school play and performing at their last music festival at school but most importantly, seeing how this affects their young member Azusa.

Azusa has always been strong and not the type to express her emotions.  Sure, she may be frustrated as the group had slacked off from practicing but she also learns that her friendship has taught them a lot.  That it's OK for her to show her sweet side, it's ok for her to show off her emotions but most of all, what it feels like to have older sisters and friends who will be by you, no matter what.

And these last episodes are a culmination of that friendship and the final months leading to their graduation and a new beginning for the Light Music Club.

While the series is the end for Yui, Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi as members of the Light Music Club, the story has continued in an animated film which ties into the final episode of the series.  But one of the cool things about this Blu-ray release are the inclusions of the two extra episodes and the OVA.

The two extra episodes are more or less episodes that take place before a certain time of the series and the OVA takes place before episode 14, if anything, episodes to prolong the fun times that these members have together.  But nevertheless, these final episodes for season two were fun and very emotional.  Graduating is emotional, saying goodbye to friends is emotional but as one chapter ends, another begins.

And I like to think that ""K-On!"" will exist.  Maybe not with the same members, but it will hopefully continue on with maybe Azusa or a whole new group of students.

But after watching season two, my feelings for the series have not changed.

I really love this series! And loved the progression of the Hokago Tea Time band and how each of these young ladies grew up together to become a band that can actually perform quite well and start playing their first major gig to now growing together and getting ready to prepare themselves to whatever happens after high school but for now, enjoying this final year together.

My favorite episodes of the second half of season two includes episode 20 featuring the group performing their songs as the school festival, episode 22 which features the girl's taking their entrance exams for college but Azusa wanting to go the extra mile of doing something special for her friends before they graduate.  And of course, episodes 23-24 were great but episode 24 being the graduation episode, will no doubt bring a fan to tears, as it is the final goodbye.

I enjoyed every episode of the series and I just enjoy how lighthearted and fun they all were.  I love the fact that it focuses on normal high school life but also the formation of a band and the dynamics with each of the members as they go through their ups and downs but also the little cute quirks that come with each character.

I typically don't go crazy over anime series, nor am I the hardcore fan that goes out and buys anything after I see a series but this is probably the first time since I watched an anime series such as ""Ranma 1/2 back in 1992, where I went out and started buying merchandise related to the series. In fact, I have purchased the PSP video game, the Figma figures and it has become one of my favorite series that I have really got into in a very long time in this manner.

The music is awesome! The characters are entertaining. The animation and art backgrounds were very good and for the most part, it has been a long time, possibly since ""Azumanga Daioh"" in which I really enjoyed gakusei-based anime series (student anime series - focused on a school setting).

As for the Blu-ray release, I know one of the major criticisms that the first season (released by Bandai Entertainment) was its price and that it only came with four episodes per volume. And many wondered if Sentai Filmworks would follow the same path. And fortunately, for fans, Sentai Filmworks included 13-episodes with this first collection and the second half, you get 14 episodes total.

As for picture quality and audio quality, ""K-On!"" also receives a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 lossless soundtrack for both English and Japanese. And the TV series looks great on Blu-ray! And as for special features, the first season never really came with any and the second only comes with the clean opening and ending themes. But fortunately, fans should be happy that this second season Blu-ray release comes with the first 13-episodes, instead of just four episodes.

If you are an anime fan who loves a straight-up, feel-good anime series with nothing dark, nothing to risque but something just all out-fun, give ""K-ON!"" a chance! It's a wonderful anime series on Blu-ray and there is really nothing like it out there (although one may want to check out the live action film ""Linda Linda"" if they are interested in a storyline of all-girl rock bands).

Overall, a fun, hilarious and entertaining second season of ""K-ON!"".  It's sad to see the character's saying goodbye, especially after enjoying each episode for season one and two and watching the adventures and wild club meetings featuring the members of the Light Music Club.  But like life for many, after high school graduation, everyone moves on in their own separate direction and begins life anew.  But I will remember ""K-On!"" for its characters, its bubbly and happy storyline, its music and upbeat energy.

Definitely one of my favorite series to be released in 2012 and an enjoyable anime series overall!

I highly recommend both ""K-On! Season Two, Collection 1 and 2.  Definitely recommended!",1354320000,6,10288,4.677580466148724
5124769,5,B0083QJVMQ,"K-On! has been part of my life for the last 2 years, and I started watching Season 2, Collection 2, not realising it was the final instalment; I had assumed there was still more to come. I could not believe how gutted I was when it finished; it felt like an important part of my life was over. Since watching the first part 2 years or so ago, and having waited months for this last part, I was used to always having more to look forward to, and found myself feeling strangely empty after the last episode; how sad does that sound?!

The last few episodes were very emotional, and I found myself close to tears more than once, especially when Azu-nyan burst into floods of tears near the end of the last episode. Thankfully, the OVA episodes (which come after the main story ends, and which are funny and bonkers) took the edge off it, and gave some idea of the future of the girls, but I don't know if there will be any more K-On! episodes now that the original 4 have graduated; hopefully they may continue with Azusa, Ui and Jun in the spotlight, and I have heard there is a movie in which the HTT girls visit London, but I don't know when or even if it will be available here.

This is a brilliant series; the attention to detail of the musical aspects of the story is great, and the characters are all lovable; especially Mio and Azusa! The slice-of-life parts of the story are cute and informative. Picture and sound quality are great, and the animation itself is first-class.

Highly recommended!",1351296000,2,1502,4.415162454873646

8524584,5,B0083QJVMQ,"See, I went through High School with this series in the last few months of my 9th grade year, It really kinda molded me into who I am today I watched from season 1 to the second season laughing along with them and even in season 2 getting Oh so very emotional, you can't help but connect with them because we all experience a kind of friendship that will never come along again. We grow such strong bonds and it's shows like this that tell us, hold onto those bonds as tight as you can. I like to think my positive way of thinking came from this series and its beloved characters...Mostly Mio and Yui for myself personally I can compare myself to the two of them the most but all the characters can just be linked to how you are so easily it almost makes you FEEL like you're very much apart of it.
