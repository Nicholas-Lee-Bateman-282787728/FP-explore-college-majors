5462503,5,B00AO1RKOO,"Recently finished watching this so though I'd share my thoughts.

The feature starts with a message from Bret to the fans basically saying he worked with WWE is picking the matches and hopes you enjoy the collection.

Something I found really neat is how he talks about his opponents before the matches are shown.

Disc 1

Bret Hart vs. Dynamite Kid - Two Out Of THree Falls Match for the British Commonwealth Jr. Heavyweight Championship
Stampede Wrestling - December 1978

Bret's Stampede Wrestling bouts are definitely rare. I did not get a chance to see Dynamite Kid much growing up. I think when I got into WWF, he was half of The British Bulldogs tag team along with Daveyboy Smith. After watching this, I see why Dynamite's so popular and hope WWE does a documentary set on him.

Bret Hart vs. Buzz Sawyer
Georgia Championship Wrestling - September 1979

I think I remember Taker saying how Buzz cheated him. I don't remember the specific details of it though. I do know it was related to money. I hated Buzz for that. But as far as being a ring talent goes, I liked him. Like his match with Dynamite Kind, a good challenge, I felt for a young Bret Hart.

Bret Hart vs. Leo Burke - North American Heavyweight Championship
Stampede Wrestling - January 1983

Not a bad one for Bret.

Bret Hart vs. Dynamite Kid
Capital Centre - September 14, 1985

Yes! Another match against Dynamite Kid and a great one at that!

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Hart Foundation vs. The Islanders
Philadelphia Spectrum - March 14, 1987

I always though The Hart Foundation was one of the best teams in history so I liked any match I saw that featured them.

Bret Hart vs. Andre the Giant
Milan, Italy - April 10, 1989

I did not know Bret fought Andre. I miss the big guy a lot so for that, it was a real treat to see him on my TV again.

Bret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect
Maple Leaf Gardens - April 23, 1989

These two never had a bad match together. Very enjoyable.

Hart Foundation vs. The Twin Towers
Duluth, Minnesota - May 17, 1989

Hart Foundation again. As stated, I like anything that featured them.

Bret Hart vs. Tiger Mask II
WWE/New Japan/All Japan Wrestling Summit - April 13, 1990

Wonderful masterpiece.

Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair - I.C. Title
New Haven, Connecticut - November 13, 1991

I thought these two always had great chemistry together.

Bret Hart on The Undertaker: This is really the only time I watch a pre-match comment. In short, Bret stated he didn't buy the early ""Frankenstein"" version of Taker's character, but started believing because Taker made it work.

Bret Hart vs. The Undertaker
MSG - January 31, 1992

This is the match that originally got me excited. A great bout although not as great as their matches from Royal Rumble 96, Summerslam 97 and One Night Only. I wish WWE would put House Show/live event matches on sets because I've been wanting to see that match from 96 where Taker and Bret fought HBK and Diesel at MSG, where Diesel nailed all three guys with a chair. Maybe it'll make it to the Best Of MSG set.

Bret Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow
Milan, Italy - April 25, 1993

Another great opponent for Bret. Considering the difference is size as far as weight, I didn't think these two would gel as great as they did. But the KOTR 93 final made a believer out of me. This match was another good one between the two.

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. Diesel
KOTR - June 19, 1994

They've had better bouts, But considering this is a collection of rare matches, this match fits best here and it wasn't a bad one by any means. I enjoyed it.

No Holds Barred
Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart
WWF RAW - March 27, 1995

I always love matches involving families because they know each other so well, it makes for a great contest. No exception here.

Bret Hart vs. Jean-Pierre Lafitte
IYH - September 24, 1995

I'm not really sure why this is here. I wasn't a fan of Lafitte at all. There's loads of rare Bret Hart matches that would've been more suitable than this. The Bret Hart-Shawn Michaels Ladder match for the I.C. Title is one example. Another great one would be Bret/LOD vs Mountie/Natural Disasters because when this was taking place, there wre feud happening between Bret/Mountie and LOD/Natural Disasters.

Bret Hart vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
Sun City Superbowl - September 14, 1996

Another reason I was anticipating this set. Like many, I was waiting for the time when I'd finally get to see this and it was worth the wait IMO.

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. The Patriot
IYH - September 7, 1997

Wasn't a fan of the angle happening here. But it was a good match.

WCW United States Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. Booker T
WCW Nitro - January 25, 1999

Good considering the caliber of talent involved. One of Bret's best WCW matches.

Bret Hart vs. Sting - Semi-Final for the WCW Title
WCW Mayhem - November 21, 1999

IMO, Sting was Bret's best WCW opponent. WHile their match from Halloween Havoc was the best in their series of matches, this one, being rarer, is definitely a great one.

I agree with Bret. Their WM9 match was the best match they had. But I still liked this one

Bret Hart & British Bulldog vs. Owen Hart & Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart
Albany, New York - October 19, 1994

Good match pitting the Hart Family against each other.

Bret Hart vs. Hakushi
WWF RAW - July 24, 1995

Always loved the matches these two had. Their IYH match was their best and I think it's gonna be on the Best Of IYH set so their match from RAW was a perfect fit here.

Bret Hart vs. Vader - WWF Title
Friday Night's Main Event - August 29, 1997

A great TV match without question if you ask me.",1363478400,7,5974,4.480074142724745
5462504,5,B00AO1RKOO,"When Bret Hart had his previous DVD set released in 2005, there was nothing, but brutal honesty from him as well as some unease after burying the hatchet with Vince.

Fast forward to now with The elder, but dignified Hitman picking up where he left off. This time with him having peace of mind. He goes over these handpicked matches (I forgot how good the KOTR match with Diesel was!) before they're shown and he also tells some great stories like a grandfather would about the days of yore.

I really enjoyed this layout and hope for more Unreleased Matches from other great Superstars giving their thoughts on their past work. The presentation ends with Bret doing what any wrestling fan would do: staying at home watching classic matches on a big ass HDTV!",1363132800,3,759,4.656716417910448
5462505,4,B00AO1RKOO,"I love Bret Hart and he is my favorite wrestler of all time. With that said I must say this DVD set is really great, not perfect, but great. He put some very rare matches from his stampede days and they are classics. There are a few complaints I have with this set. He should not have included the match against the patriot in here. Also the match with booker t shouldn't have made it in my opinion. He had another excellent, far better match against booker t that should have made it instead. The patriot match just didn't fit with this set. He should have added his classic match against the 123 kid on raw in 1994. I know that these are rare and hard to find matches thats why its called the dungeon matches so fans should remember its not his BEST matches, more like his Most RARE matches. But i still think the couple matches i named shouldnt have made it. Whats really great in this dvd and i really enjoy is Bret talks about every match before its shown. It's pretty interesting to hear Bret talk about those times in his life and what those matches means to him.  All in all this is a definite must have for hitman fans. Hopefully if it sells well he can make a volume two and give us some more great matches.  I highly recommend it to Bret Hart fans and all wrestling fans.",1362960000,4,1282,4.228571428571429
5462506,4,B00AO1RKOO,"So I just finished watching the new Bret Hart DVD set.  I thought the set was pretty good but it could have been a whole lot better.  The matches (some of them) are kind of just lackluster and I found myself wishing this was a whole new documentary because his introductions to each match are sometimes even more exciting than the matches themselves.  This is just a review of the DVD release and not the Blu Ray.

The first match is supposed to be a 2 out 3 fall match for the British Commonwealth Jr Heavyweight Championship in Stampede Wrestling in December 1978.  The match pits champ Bret Hart against Dynamite Kid.  I say that it is supposed to be a 2 out 3 fall match because my copy of the match only shows the 2nd fall.  That fall went about 13 minutes and is a great fall which makes you want to see the first fall just as bad.  There was no 3rd fall because Bret won both.  It was a good way to start the release but I really wish I could have seen that first fall.

The next match is Bret taking on Buzz Sawyer in September of 1979 from Georgia Championship Wrestling.  This was a good match but not great.  It went to a 10 minute time limit draw and I kind of felt like I was watching a resume video where Bret was putting this match on there just to show people that this is what he does.  It was a great wrestling match and nothing more.

The next match was Bret taking on Leo Burke in January 1983 in Stampede wrestling.  It was for the North American Championship.  Again, this is not a complete match.  It is joined in progress and you get to see about 7 minutes.  I didn't even like those 7 minutes so I'm glad the whole thing wasn't on there.  As a side note, in all three of these matches the video quality is lacking.

The next match is the first real good one from WWE and it has Bret taking on Dynamite Kid in September 1985.  This is a great wrestling match with fast paced action and a lot of counter holds.  This is one that is definatly worth checking out.

The next match is a tag match with the Hart Foundation taking on the Islanders for the tag titles in March 1987.  When I first found out this match was going to be on the set I was kind of curious.  The Islanders were a strange team to add to the set but it was a great tag match.  Again, it was a lot of action and very fast paced.  Worth checking out again.

After that we get Bret taking on Andre the Giant from Italy in April 1989.  The video quality is terrible and I don't know Bret insists on keeping the foreign commentary for these matches (much like he did with the Spain match on his first DVD set with Bam Bam Bigelow).  This match was bad.  Didn't like it at all.

The next match was Bret taking on Mr Perfect from Toronto in April 1989.  I knew when this match was announced that it would be a 20 minute time limit draw and I was right.  Most of their matches from this era ended in draws.  Actually this was a great match and the reason is because most of the time, if you watch their matches, you'll notice they do a lot of the same spots and moves but in this match they did a lot of different things so this is one worth checking out.

Disc 2 starts with another tag match as the Hart Foundation takes on the Twin Towers in May 1989.  This was a pretty good match but nothing like their matches with the Bulldogs, the Rockers, Demolition or the Killer Bees.  It's a rare match but I think it could have been left off the set.

After that we get Bret taking on Tiger Mask II from Tokyo Dome in April 1990.  This was a great match and another 20 minute time limit draw.  This match was good but honestly, Misawa as Tiger Mask was probably the worst one.  The original Tiger Mask was the best and the 3rd one wasn't too bad either.  This match was good and kind of slow but still worth checking out.

Next we get Bret taking on Ric Flair in November 1991 for the IC title.  This is a rare match and is actually one of their better matches.  There was a lot of back and forth action and Ric is really good in this one.  I love the introduction to this match as well where Bret talks about Ric having no ring philosophy.  Very interesting and a good match.

After that we get Bret taking on Undertaker from MSG in January 1992.  This is a pretty good match but they would have better matches as the years went on.  This one was just, once again, okay.  Nothing really special.

The next match is Bret taking on Bam Bam Bigelow from Italy in April 1993.  Once again, we have to hear the Italian commentators which kind of take away from the match but not too much.  Bret and Bam always had great matches and this one was no different.  This was a really good match with one of the best big men in the business.  Worth checking out.

Disc 3 starts with Bret taking on Diesel at King of the Ring 1994 for the world title.  Bret and Diesel always had great matches and this one was one of those matches.  I remember being disappointed when this match wasn't on the KOTR set but it's great to see it on this set.  Very good match, not as good as Survivor Series 1995, but still good.

After that we get the No Holds Barred match with Bret taking on Owen from Raw 1995.  A lot of people wanted this one on this set and I can't figure out why.  This match was ok but not great.  I have seen a hell of lot better matches with these two than this one.  I'd skip this one if I was you.

The next match is the In Your House match between Bret and Jean Pierre LaFitte in 1995.  This match is better than you'd think it would be.  There was a dumb storyline for the match with the pirate LaFitte taking Bret's jacket but the match itself is really good and worth checking out.

The next match is Bret taking on Steve Austin from South Africa in September 1996.  One thing I was glad of is the fact that there is no South African commentary.  The match itself is a really good match but not on par with Survivor Series or Wrestlemania 13.  Still, it is one of the better matches on the set.

The next match is Bret taking on the Patriot from In Your House Ground Zero in September 1997.  Again, I thought this was an unusual choice but after seeing it again all these years later I understood why.  This match tells a great story as it starts slowly and then progresses to a fast paced and exciting match.  This is another gem on this set in my opinion.  Also, as a side note, check out Patriot's theme song:  It's the song that Kurt Angle would later use.

The next match is Bret taking on Booker T for the US title on Nitro in January 1999.  This is a very good match and one that I am glad Bret put on this set.  You know, a lot of people, Bret included, hated his time in WCW.  Granted, they didn't do much with him storyline wise, but I think his matches there are very underrated.  I think he had some really good ones there and this is one of them.  Check it out.

Lastly, we have Bret taking on Sting in the semi finals for the world title at Mayhem in November 1999.  This was a good match but again, he had better ones with Sting.  Still, it is a fun match to watch and the introduction to the bout is interesting as well as Bret talks about his misconceptions of Sting.

All in all, the set is good and a great addition to some of his other sets.  Is it excellent?  No.  I think it's just an okay set.  It felt like it was just missing something.  I do wish he would have included one of his 60 minute draws with Dynamite in Stampede.  I wish he would have included a tag match with the Killer Bees cause I have seen some great ones.  I think he should have picked another Undertaker match rather than what he did pick.  I don't know something just seems like it's missing.  I do hope he gets to do another set in the future with some more ""lost"" matches or, what I would like to see is because Bret is so well traveled, I would like to see him pick matches that only took place overseas.  From Canada to England, from Spain to Kuwait.  That would be interesting.  Anyway, if you're a fan of Bret like I am check out this set.  Even though it's an okay set it's still better than some of the other WWE releases.",1362960000,6,8107,4.099363057324841
5462507,5,B00AO1RKOO,"Wow! This product reinforces why i've been a Bret Hart fan for almost 20 years. I seem to have become a bigger fan of his even after i met him in person for a book signing and how the dvd's VHS's and blue rays of his career showcase the creative processes of his matches. Not only is he (in my opinion the best wrestler period) he is genuine man who is very thankful and grateful that he can talk about his career and experiences behind each match to his fans. (He really loves his fans.) Anyhow, pick this blue ray up! All of the matches are great. Most never seen and some rarely seen or forgotten. Thanks Hitman!",1362787200,,615,4.220338983050848
5462508,5,B00AO1RKOO,"I bought the blu ray version and it is definitely worth the extra money. The matches very in quality from poor to ppv quality, but they are all entertaining. The tidbits from Bret are really what makes this compilation so compelling. If there is a volume two I will definitely pre-order it. If you're a Bret mark then you will not be disappointed in this release! *****",1362787200,,369,4.522388059701493
5462509,5,B00AO1RKOO,"Okay...
other reviewers have listed the contents per the WWE press release... so I won't be redundant, I WILL remind everybody that if you have a BR player you do get a lot of extra content for a few more bucks. Obviously on the older footage BR or DVD doesn't matter as the footage is in really poor shape. Bret's comments go far beyond just his matches on the DVD and he discusses the changing landscape of Pro Wrestling as the set progresses, so it can be enjoyed on many levels.

Now ... I do agree that there are great matches and its nice to have several eras of Brets' career represented but what really got me watching this today was that Bret himself was so involved in the process and as he said .... almost in tears at the very end ... he really is grateful that his legacy is preserved on this set and for years he had worried that would not be the case so making peace with WWF/WWE has been good for all. He is always honest and I found his discussion of miss reading STING and how he sort of took Stings finishing move ... typical of his approach throughout the set. This is a wonderful companion to his excellent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitman/dp/0091932866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitman</a>&nbsp;as well as the other DVD sets available on his career&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Bret-Hitman-Hart-The-Best-There-Is-The-Best-There-Was-The-Best-There-Ever-Will-Be/dp/B000AOEPU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Bret ""Hitman"" Hart - The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Greatest-Rivalries-Shawn-Michaels-vs-Bret-Hart-Blu-ray/dp/B005BYBZBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Greatest Rivalries - Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart [Blu-ray</a>]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitman-Hart-Wrestling-with-Shadows/dp/B00500ATVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows</a>

An excellent set, I can't deduct a single star as I believe its a great value for 10 hours (BR) of classic wrestling history from one of the most beloved and in some ways controversial and pivotal figures in the sports entertainment history!",1362700800,,2290,6.336538461538462
5462510,5,B00AO1RKOO,"The best way I can describe this Bret Hart DVD/Blu-ray release is to borrow an old gimmick from iTunes: Bret's first DVD release can be classified as ""The Basics"" and the Dungeon Collection can be classified as the ""Deep Cuts"". This collection contains the rare gems from Bret's wrestling career. The rarely seen matches that most fans have probably only read about but have never seen.

Man, I don't know where to start first, this collection has so much great content on it. You'll see tons of great and rare matches, each of which are introduced by Bret himself, and he gives some awesome insight while telling some insider stories for each one. And there are some classic matches on this release: Bret vs Dynamite Kid in a 2-out-of-3-falls match for the British Commonwealth Jr. Heavyweight Championship, Bret vs Steve Austin from the Sun City Superbowl (this match is just a step below their classic Survivor Series match a few months later, and that's not a knock!), Bret vs Tiger Mask II from 1990, Bret vs Andre the Giant (I didn't even know these two ever faced off before this release), Bret vs Flair for the IC Title from 1991, Bret vs Bam Bam Bigelow (these two always had great chemistry together), Bret vs Mr. Perfect (one of Bret's best opponents), Bret vs Diesel from King of the Ring (I thought this was their best match and was thrilled to find it on this release) and an amazing match against his brother Owen, plus tons more!

In my opinion, the Blu-ray is the edition to get because you get more matches and tons more stories from Bret not found on the DVD edition.
I can't put this release over enough, Christmas has come early to say the least folks! I for one hope to see a Vol. 2 edition of the Dungeon Collection in the very near future.

Note on the quality of the Andre the Giant match: Yes, this match does not look good at all and here's the back story on it. For whatever reason, the WWF at the time didn't save this show in their video archives. However, a fan that had recorded the broadcast of this match from television onto vhs had posted it to Youtube 8 months ago (do a search on youtube for Bret vs Andre the Giant and you'll find the exact same match, quality, tracking problem spots, etc.; it was posted 8 months ago). WWE, since they own the original rights, simply downloaded it from Youtube and included this only surviving version (that we know of) on this set. It would've been nice if they could've used the original poster's vhs tape, but he probably would've wanted money for it. So, it's a Youtube download instead, and some people may not like this due to the poor quality, but at least we get to see it. This isn't the first time WWE has downloaded video from Youtube that's missing from their archives to include on DVDs. They also did this on Steamboat's DVD. They downloaded fan uploaded footage of a famous angle between Flair and Steamboat from Mid-Atlantic that doesn't exist in the archives they bought of Mid-Atlantic (many wrestling promotions back then would record over their show tapes and not save them, no one knew how valuable their show footage would later become.",1362441600,10,3132,4.569395017793594

5462513,5,B00AO1RKOO,"Wished the WWE would release more of this type of set where the focus is on rare or previously unreleased matches rather than the usual and well-known PPV matches that have been seen many times before. In this set Bret Hart is the main focus as he does wrap-around segments giving out interesting tid-bits and stories right before a match is shown. For the most part picture quality is good(considering the age of some of these matches) with the exception of the Andre match, which is barely viewable. A couple of odd things I noticed is that first of all Slick's entrance music has been overdubbed(which is strange since in an earlier Hogan DVD set it was left intact) and secondly the banner hanging above the ring with the title ""Superstars of Wrestling""(an old WWF tv show)  was blurred from view for some reason. But otherwise this is a nice set of rarely seen Bret Hart matches.",1422316800,3,884,4.630573248407643

5462533,4,B00AO1RKOO,"This is the fourth Bret Hart themed WWE DVD set (his career documentary, the anthology of the Hart Family, and a chronicle of his rivalry with Shawn Michaels) with WWE going the same direction they did with the last set on Hulk Hogan & the current ECW series where each match on here has been previously unreleased by WWE.  It should be noted that Bret gives a short commentary before each match either explaining his relationship against his opponent or the circumstances behind the match plus with some of these matches being so rare & never been seen past their original airing decades ago that the audio & visual quality of some of the matches is very poor as if it was coming off a dirty VHS tape (which I made a note of on each match).

Matches Include:
British Commonwealth Jr. Heavyweight Championship/2 Out Of 3 Falls Match vs. Dynamite Kid - This match was joined in progress during the second fall & was really nothing more past Dynamite working over Bret's legs with various stretches & submissions while keeping Bret grounded with headlocks.
""Stampede Wrestling"" Dec. 78

vs. Buzz Sawyer - It should be noted that the picture quality here isn't very good as it looks like it came from an old dirty VHS tape.  While Buzz is mostly known for being the ""Mad Dog"" brawler, this was before that as he was more focused on just wrestling as it was a very technical contest with both men scoring takedowns on each other while with Buzz working over different parts of the body while Bret kept getting more & more aggressive throughout the match.
""Georgia Championship Wrestling"" Sept. 79

vs. North American Heavyweight Champion Leo Burke - This was joined in progress for the last 5 minutes & was competitive for that time but nothing special.
""Stampede Wrestling"" Jan. 83

vs. Dynamite Kid - Dynamite started out in control causing Bret to keep going to the outside before being able to gain an advantage targeting the neck with an elbow & leg drop while also using dirty tactics like a bodyslam on the floor or a low blow but Kid was able to keep reversing Bret's offense for quick pins & counters while delivering aggressive offense like a hard whip into the corner chest first & a back suplex that landed Bret on his neck.  As Bret commented on before the match, they had plenty of singles matches but this was the only one that they knew was going to be taped so they went harder than usual here.
""Capital Centre"" Sept. 85

WWE Tag Team Champions Hart Foundation vs. The Islanders - Jimmy Hart was in the Foundation's corner along with the newest member ex-referee Danny Davis as the Islanders kept control the Foundation causing then to keep retreating to the floor before the Foundation took control with various double teaming along with dirty tactics like choking with the tag rope & working a member over on the floor while Niedhart at one moment had such superior power that he knocked Haku to the floor with a back elbow as both teams traded momentum but it was when one person took advantage of a distraction from the referee that made all the difference.
""Philadelphia Spectrum"" Mar. 87

vs. Andre the Giant - It should be noted that the audio & video quality was very poor during the first half of this match while the commentary was in italian.  Bret tried using his speed against Andre & even caught him in the ropes at one point while Andre had superior power with his chops & a death grip choke but Bret kept targeting Andre's back with strikes only for Andre to keep stopping him dead in his tracks with his strikes.  That match didn't go long & really wasn't much past the fact that it was a rare match between these two & the story behind how this came together.
Apr. 89

vs. Mr. Perfect - Bret started out staying one step ahead of Perfect avoiding his moves like the drop toe hold & countering the others such as clothesline into a crucifix to the point where Perfect had to retreat to the floor & kept breaking the count before he was able to take advantage of the referee to gain control constantly knocking Bret outside to the floor & even off the apron into the guardrail but a miscalculation by Perfect opened the door for Bret to heavily work over his arm with strikes & stretches.  Both men continued to trade momentum with a series of reversals & counters to the point where some offense that worked earlier didn't work a second time resulting in what Gorilla Moonsoon called a ""methodical destruction"" as this was one of the first ever matches these two had against each other & the first good match they had according to Bret as it was wrestling quality as it usually is between these two.
""Maple Leaf Gardens"" Apr. 89

Hart Foundation vs. The Twin Towers - This started out with Niedhart & Boss Man evenly matched when it came to power before Anvil actually left his feet with a dropkick & worked over his arm which Bret also did when he was tagged in while Anvil took a page out of Slick's own playbook on the outside before the Towers were able to gain control when Akeem dropped all of his weight onto Bret along with the Towers continuing to use their superior size for double teaming such as a double splash in the corner & bearhugs.  This was a quick television match but was good for the time they had.
May 89

vs. Tiger Mask II - This was during a rare tour of Japan that WWE did back in the early 1990's with there being no commentary during the match.  Tiger kept control with working over Bret's arm with armdrags, armbars, knees & the hammerlock while later continuing to work over the arm with a armbar stretch while also taking it to the air with a crossbody over the top rope as Bret tried to gain control with grounded holds like the chinlock & headlock only to resort to old dirty tactics to gain control.  Outside of the uniqueness of how this match came about, it wasn't much as both men worked a heavily grounded style that never really left ""first gear.""
""Tokyo Dome"" Apr. 90

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Ric Flair - This was one of Flair's early WWE matches to the point where he was still doing the ""Real World's Champion"" gimmick with him still having the NWA/WCW Championship (the current World Heavyweight Championship) in his possession.  Bret started out grounding Flair with takedowns & a side headlock while Flair's offense consisted of his trademark chops in the corner only for Bret to rebound constantly taking Flair down with clotheslines before Flair regained control resorting to his ""dirtiest player in the game"" ways using the ring ropes various times but pin attempts & the figure four.  This was a contest that saw both men trade momentum throughout the contest & even briefly take it to the outside at times.
Nov. 91

vs. Undertaker - Undertaker was dominate early with a slow methodical pace causing Bret to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" but wasn't able to knock Taker off his feet to the point where he landed on his feet after a dropkick sent him over the top rope causing Bret to resort to a over the top crossbody to take him down but a distraction from Paul Bearer allowed Taker to take control again sending Bret into the steps before applying various chokes & smothering him with a death grip while also taking it to the air with what we now know as ""Old School"" along with the flying clothesline while constantly shoving Bret off & sitting up after each offensive move & pin attempt by Bret.  Taker's gimmick at the time was what Bret described as ""Frankenstein"" who didn't sell a lot of punishment & kept coming no matter what you did to him but Bret put up a better effort against Taker than most others did during this period.
""Madison Square Garden"" Jan. 92

vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - The commentary for this match is in italian while we also get a pre-match promo from Bret.  Bigelow easily overpowered Bigelow early causing Bret to go into the ""hit & move"" strategy working over the arm with armbars & stretches while using some strength himself with a shoulder block knocking Bigelow to the outside before Bigelow regained control catching Bret & ramming him into the post allowing him to heavily work over the back with various blows, hard whips into the post, and a backbreaker.  This was a good match that told a good story of both men working over a body part.
Apr. 93

WWE Championship Match vs. Diesel - While most people remember their series in 1995 to early 1996 over the WWE Championship, this was actually their first match against each other in a rare ""Champion vs. Champion"" encounter during that time which was also not only Diesel's first main event but his first PPV singles match as well with Bret Hart having his old Hart Foundation partner Jim ""The Anvil"" Niedhard in his corner to counter Shawn Michaels at ringside.  Bret took away Diesel's size & power advantage by taking Diesel down & working over his legs with various holds like the figure four & using the ring post before Diesel was able to come back & work over Bret's back with various holds like the backbreaker & sidewalk slam while also using the ring post & Shawn getting involved whenever he could only for that to eventually backfire at one point.  As I stated early in that they would have series of matches later on that would be better than this one with more relaxed rules but this was still a good contest as Diesel was in his prime performance wise during this run in the WWE while Bret has the ability to bring more of out limited bigger than others usually do while telling a great story of breaking Diesel down by his legs along with Shawn & Anvil playing a big factors as well.
King Of The Ring 94

No Holds Barred Match vs. Owen Hart - This was set to be their final encounter after a year of these two feuding against each other with Bret promising since he return a month earlier that we would see a more aggressive side of him which we saw when Owen attacked Bret coming into the ring only for Bret to rebound yanking Owen down by this hair & continuing to punish Owen using the ropes to choke, brawling on the outside sending Owen into the steel steps & slamming him on the floor, and back in the ring where he kept beating on Owen who was trapped in the ropes.  Owen had to resort to raking the eyes & low blow to gain some momentum while throwing Bret into the steps & guardrail on the outside before both men would be on the receiving end of an exposed turnbuckle throughout the match.  This wasn't a ""hardcore"" match with these two underneath these rules but was one of their most physical encounters against each other with Bret showing the aggression that we rare see out of him both before & after the match.
""RAW"" Mar. 95

vs. Jean-Pierre Lafitte - We get a little funny goof before the match as Bret did the pre-match interview then actually walked through the front door of the ""In Your House"" stage instead of the actual entrance with Bret starting this match off with a bang with him some out very aggressively with a suicide dive to the outside during Lafitte's entrance & traded punches before Lafiette was able to take back control using his power & ring awareness to wear down Bret whipping him into the corner chest first & the steps on the outside while also delivering some impactful moves like the spinebuster & legdrop including one from the top rope while also attempting a cannonball off the top rope & to the outside along with being able to stay one step ahead of Bret countering his moves including avoiding Bret's attempt at a crossbody that sent Bret tangled up in the ropes.  While Bret himself admitted that the storyline may have been the lamest one in his career & Lafitte had an evil pirate gimmick (long before Johnny Depp made being a pirate look cool), this was a better match than anyone expected & better match than I remember it being look back at it now almost 2 decades later.
""In Your House"" Sept. 95

vs. Steve Austin - This match takes place on WWE's tour of South Africa & was also Bret's last match commitment under his contract at that time after taking a few months off with Owen Hart (who was telling everyone him & Bret have patched up their differences) being the guest commentator as well.  Austin tried to intimidate Bret only for him to respond with a shove as both men tried to get the early advantage with Austin attempting to ground & wear Bret down even resorting to pulling the hair to keep control before was able to counter working over the arm with a hammerlock takedown & wristlock while beating on Austin's arm.  They would go on to exchange back & forth pin attempts only for them to be countered by the other before Austin had to resort to his dirty tactics as low blows while focusing on the throat area with elbows & chinlocks while Bret started taking more high risk such as the over the top rope crossbody & top rope elbow.  This was one of their first matches against each other & would go on to be better but still a quality encounter that Jim Ross summarized as ""a hard fought grueling victory.""
""Sun City Superbowl"" Sept. 96

WWE Championship Match vs. The Patriot - It was during this time that Bret was doing his anti-USA/pro-Canada character facing off against the pro-USA character of The Patriot who already had a victory of Bret weeks earlier.  Bret jumped Patriot from behind beating on him with stomps & punches before Patriot recovered working over Bret's arm with armbars & kneedrops while Bret targeted his knees with strikes & dropping his weight on it followed by a figure four on the post.  They traded momentum back & forth with their associates making their presence known at ringside while Patriot pulled out all the stops in the ring include Bret's own sharpshooter.  This was a good match with storytelling of both men working over a body part.
""In Your House: Ground Zero"" Sept. 97

WCW United States Championship Match vs. Booker T - Bret was coming into this match with a legit groin injury that kept causing him to stall by going to the floor & in the ropes whenever Booker got a little bit of offense before eventually able to take control with offense like a double arm DDT along with tactics like a low headbutt, raking the eyes with the ropes & choking in the corner while later working over Booker's previously injured leg before Booker T started to come back with his various kicks from the side & standing while also giving Bret a taste of his own medicine using the guardrail on the outside.  This match was as good as it could be considering Bret's injury at the time but this is on here as Bret stated that he felt Booker was one of the guys in WCW that if he got to do real business with him that he could elevate & draw money with.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Jan. 99

vs. Sting - This was the semi-final match in the WCW Championship tournament with Bret having the home field advantage of this match taking place in Canada but Sting also had an advantage with Bret coming into the match with a bad leg.  Both men went to the outside early bouncing Sting's head off the apron & guardrail before coming back in with a low headbutt & atomic drop causing Sting to respond with a low blow himself working over the midsection followed by sending Bret onto the announce table however Bret was able to keep avoiding the Stinger Splash before an outside party made his presence known.  Despite this being a dream match scenario just based off their similar finishing moves alone back when they worked for opposite companies, they didn't work against each other much in WCW making this the best match they've had while also showing signs of the old ""hero"" Bret Hart that we didn't really get to see much of in WCW.
""WCW Mayhem"" Nov. 99

(Blu-Ray) vs. WWE Champion Yokozuna - Both men started out feeling each other out before Yoko was able to catch Bret in mid-run with a slam with Bret being able to recover sending Yoko to the outside before Yoko ended up ramming himself into the ring post with Bret trying to capitalize with a sleeper hold only to be knocked down & stay down as Yoko continued to ground Bret with nerve holds & chokes while also using the involvement of Mr. Fuji & a weapon on the outside.  Both men went back & forth with Bret using a ""hit & run"" offense such as a bulldog off the ropes & sharpshooter while Yoko continued to use his size & power such as the belly to belly suplex & bearhug causing Bret to resort to desperate tactics such as biting to escape resulting in a good match between both men.
""RAW"" Nov. 93

(Blu-Ray) w/British Bulldog vs. Owen Hart & Jim Neidhart - Bret started out working over Owen's arm with hammerlock & armbar while Bulldog used his power such as the delayed vertical suplex & clothesline causing Owen & Anvil to resort to taking shots off the apron & double teaming behind the referee to regain the advantage including using the old signature Hart Attack along with taunting causing Bret to distract the referee before it eventually ended up with all four men in the ring at the same time resorting to Bret & Bulldog beating Owen & Anvil at their own game in what was a fun tag match.
Oct. 94

(Blu-Ray) vs. Hakushi - Hakushi attacked from behind sending Bret into the steps & guardrail on the outside while working him over in the ring sliding him into the post followed by a baseball slide as Hakushi was able to keep knocking him down whenever Bret was able to get in an offensive move while keeping him down with nerve holds along with high risk offense such a headbutt off the top rope & moonsault over the top to the floor but Bret was able to make a comeback taking some risk of his own with a backspring crossbody off the apron & mounting a comeback with a top rope elbow, bulldog out the corner, superplex, and sharpshooter.  Bret commented before this match that Hakushi had a very unique style for the time & he wanted to showcase him which he did as he was never truly showcased as well past his series with Bret.
""RAW"" July 95

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship Match vs. Vader - Vader was dominate early with vertical splashes against Bret after he disrespected him but missed a splash against the guardrail allowing Bret to take advantage using the steps on the outside as they traded punches with Vader getting the upper hand causing Bret to resort to desperate tactics only for them to backfire.  This match didn't go long as it's only purpose was to continue to establish the unlikely partnership between The Patriot & Vader along with the story before the match of Bret talking about how Vader tried to be very careful when working with Bret after the various talents complained about him being ""too stiff.""
""Friday Night's Main Event"" Aug. 97

Other Blu-Ray extras include bonus stories from Bret including talking about his history as an artist, some of his favorite things in & out of the ring, the one time he had to travel & perform from Japan to Guam to Honolulu within hours of each other, sleeping on the plane rides, his Survivor Series match against Bob Backlund, an idea he had for a masked character he had, the prank played on Yokozuna that he ended up paying for, a funny story about the time him & Owen got stopped at customs, one time him & Owen were out to sea & ran out of gas, how the importance of a pair of sunglasses were to the fan who got them at SummerSlam '92, and who he feels are the two most respected talents in Japan.

This set was a mixed bag with the negative being that you can tell the idea of the matches being ""unreleased"" did limit the choices that could have been made (as Bret himself said in the Blu-Ray extra that he loved the Survivor Series match with Backlund but couldn't put it on here) which made some cases being a match that wasn't significant or really anything of high quality but it's on here because it was one of his favorite all time opponents but the positive being that we got some rare matches that were good quality but are usually forgotten about because they didn't have a major storyline or importance relevance in his career.  Overall I enjoyed a majority of the matches on here while hearing Bret's throughout on the opponents or background of the match were interesting to hear as well so this is a set I do recommend.",1368230400,2,20159,4.492622950819672
5462534,5,B00AO1RKOO,I really liked this bluray. Fantastic matches id never seen. Great commentary by Bret. He was a fav as a kid in the 80's and still is as a fan today. I love the mid-late 80's early 90's wrestling. Bret was one of the absolute best WWF ever had.,1368144000,,244,4.0

5462536,5,B00AO1RKOO,"This is an amazing WWE set. What sets this collection apart is the level of superstar involvement. I love how Bret Hart provides commentary to each match before it is shown. A lot of great stories are told about the matches that fans may not have been aware of. With a career as long and interest as Hart's, many great matches are shown. I especially loved the first couple matches on this set that shows The Hitman before he reached the night of superstardom. You can't go wrong with this set of matches if you are a Bret Hart fan. The blu ray picture quality is excellent as always, with a few matches being a little rough because of the vhs source material. I would give this set 5 sharpshooters out of 5. A must own WWE release!!!!",1367625600,,735,4.333333333333333
5462537,4,B00AO1RKOO,"This was pretty solid, although, I wanted some different matches. I was born in '84, but it is still hard for me to watch the older matches on this set. The beauty of this is that Bret even chose a decent amount of matches that he did not go over in. This just shows why Bret is and always will be the best pro-wrestler that ever lived.",1367452800,,336,4.029850746268656

5462540,5,B00AO1RKOO,"Bret Hart was my favorite wrestler back in the day, so it was a real treat to see his classic matches again. I loved the matches from his time in his fathers territory and his time during WCW.",1365292800,2,192,4.078947368421052

5462542,4,B00AO1RKOO,"The Dungeon Collection is an interesting and entertaining collection of unreleased Bret Hart matches. None of the matches in this collection are five star matches, but that's not the purpose of this box set. This box set is a great purchase for professional wrestling historians, because of the extremely rare Stampede, Mid-South and WWF house-show matches. This rare footage is a cool piece of professional wrestling history worth owning, especially the Bret Hart vs Andre The Giant match. I would not recommend this box set to casual WWE fans. If you're looking for Bret Hart's classic career defining matches, then I suggest you buy his 2006 dvd box set instead. In conclusion, this box set is a great addition to WWE's expanding dvd library, and will definitely please long time fans.",1364947200,2,788,5.022900763358779

8555083,5,B00AO1RKOO,"This was considerably better than most other ""greatest hits"" type compilations. It's clear Bret hand picked these matches. And his insight and stories that are interspliced throughout are great.

This collection is missing what are actually his greatest matches, like Owen at Wrestlemania 10, Perfect at Summerslam, Bulldog at Summerslam, Shawn Michaels Iron Man match, etc. That being said, there are matches with Perfect, Owen, and Austin. Think of more as a collection of deep cuts than greatest matches.

The matches I enjoyed the most were a couple of older ones with Dynamite Kid. All in all, this is a great collection for any Bret Hart fan, or even wrestling fan.",1499990400,,671,5.036036036036036
8555084,5,B00AO1RKOO,"A great collection of Bret Harts incredible matches. From his begginings of wrestling for his father's business, Stampede Wrestling, to his career in the WWF/WWE. I highly recommend this series!",1489795200,,194,5.5

8555086,5,B00AO1RKOO,"Whether you're a fan of Bret Hart, or a fan of wrestling, this is a must see. Some great matches here and interesting insight by the ""Hitman"". As an early teen I got into wrestling when Warrior was gone and Hogan had left for Hollywood and WCW. I needed a hero. After catching up from PPV's from late 80's to early 90's I chose Bret because of his technical ability and because although he had a bit of the underdog going for him, he was also just as physical and tough as the biggest guys around. Bret was a great champion and a great worker. And this blu ray enhances the experience from the previous Bret Hart DVD entitled ""The Best There Is, The Best There Was, And The Best There Ever Will Be."" Matches with the Dynamite Kid, to Andre The Giant, Mr. Perfect, and Ric Flair are on here as well as his see saw match up with Kevin Nash aka Diesel at the King Of the Ring. Their match at Survivor Series 95 was one of my favorites with the Iron Man Match and Summerslam 91 with Perfect but this is a great one to see how they build up on the David and Goliath story. His first match with Stone Cold pre Survivor Series 96 is on here as well and much more.",1462492800,3,1156,4.096916299559472
