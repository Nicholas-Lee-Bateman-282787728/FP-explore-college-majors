It would ok movie to watch on saturday nite.",1415491200,,267,3.8727272727272726
7809035,1,6300991784,"I knew as soon as I saw the name Fred Olen Ray on the screen I was in for a wild ride of crapitude and I was not disappointed. Something from outer space crashes on Earth. The creature that emerges immediately starts killing people. Two cops assigned to the case do some half-assed investigating while a shadowy government agency tries to clean up the mess themselves since they caused the whole thing. At the crash site the cops had each taken a large stone object but hadn't figured out what it was. One of them, along with his new girlfriend, takes it to a scientist friend who drills into it releasing the creature inside. Now knowing what's doing the killing, the cop goes after the grown up version.

The overall story has no originality and the creatures are low budget rip-offs of Alien. The actors all chew scenery like they haven't had a meal in a year. The writing, well I don't believe this movie was so much written as the lines were vomited out by embarrassed actors. At one point the hero cop is referred to as a legend. If that's true then criminals have nothing to worry about because there was no actual police work done. The one scene that epitomizes the level of unintended hilarity this movie sinks to: When the scientist drills into the rock, a creature leaps out at his face. The cop pulls the creature off and tosses it aside . . . right into his girlfriend's face.",1369440000,,1389,4.468503937007874
7809036,1,6300991784,"Insultingly stupid and cheesy, only the guys from MST3K could make it watchable. Unless you are determined to see Julie Newmar at the end of her career, or Ron Glass (Barney Miller) at the beginning, it's a complete waste of two hours.",1365897600,,235,4.619047619047619
7809037,5,6300991784,"This was great. Just good fun and a good laugh. Watch for the scene where LT Maclamore throws the small monster away from the scientist. Yes, it lands on his girlfriend. What did I learn from this movie? No matter how heavily armed you are, (SPAZ 12 in this case) it is impossable to look cool with a white dove on your shoulder. And he knows it!",1353196800,,346,4.17910447761194
7809038,3,6300991784,"You would think at least part of a movie called Deep Space would take place in outer space, but no.  Oh, something does come crashing down to Earth here, but it's something a military black ops program put up there in the first place.  Nothing could go wrong, they said.  Well, despite some of the most intense random button-pushing ever captured on film, something does go wrong - really badly wrong.  The end result is a low-budget knockoff of the creature in Alien running around killing people.  With project scientists and the military helpless (or unwilling) to stop it, there's obviously only one force on Earth capable of saving the day - a sarcastic cop who doesn't play by the rules.

It apparently seemed like a good idea at the time: assemble a team of wacky scientists to create a deadly killing machine designed to fight America's future enemies, and then shoot it off into space.  When it accidentally falls back to earth, these same guys say there's nothing to worry about because ""the project"" is in its dormant state.  Well, it doesn't stay dormant for long, as two dumb kids find out the hard way.  Detective Ian McLemore (Charles Napier) and his partner Jerry Merris (Ron Glass), despite always being on the verge of being fired, are always given the big cases, and this double homicide is one of them.  Perpetual sarcasm aside, McLemore isn't the type who will let anyone or anything (such as his boss' orders or the military or even a helpful psychic played by Julie Newmar) get in the way of his solving a crime.

Deep Space proves to be even less exciting than it sounds.  Sure, it's comical to watch grown men and women wrestle with the ""monster,"" but way too much of this story involves far too little happening.  Despite the 1988 release date, everything about the film screams 1970s to me (and that's not a good thing), including the scientific equipment on display.  Things do at least get a little messy toward the end, but even that is nothing to get overly excited about.  The bottom line is this: if you enjoy police procedurals slammed full of clich&eacute;d characters, you might enjoy this one, but science fiction fans should feel free to pass this one by without giving it a second thought.",1349136000,2,2228,4.676923076923077
7809039,3,6300991784,"Three parts ""Aliens"", one part ""The Thing"", then add shredded cheddar until desired level of horror cheesiness is achieved.  This laughable flick is only advisable for connoisseurs of truly bad horror.

Like most 80s horror, the plot is essentially that some ""thing"" starts killing people.  Not surprisingly, a lot of our questions about the plot will go unanswered.  More specifically, some government scientists engineered this alien-mutant-monster thing.  They never explain why.  Then they put it into a dormant state and shot it into space.  They never explain why.  Then the monster storage space parcel crashes back onto Earth.  They never explain why.  After the first few minutes of the movie the story takes place entirely on Earth, yet it's called Deep Space.  They never explain why.

After the ""ship"" crashes to Earth a couple of nearby teens go investigate.  Guess what?  They won't be right back.  Amid the burning rubble they find a giant pod-thing that is evidently the monster's cocoon of sorts.  Much as in The Thing, tendrils fire from its body and drag the nutritious teens to its over-sized maw.  Some rather unattractive cops, whose lines are both written and acted poorly to the point of annoyance, investigate and serve as our protagonists.  You never feel the urge to root for them.

So the cops take the alien pod thing to their crime lab where, just like in The Thing, it comes to life, kills, and disappears quietly...from the police station!  Sure, aliens may be sneaky.  But later, every scene with these creatures depicts them as extremely noisy.  Setting this ridiculous notion aside, the cops turn their attention to some other pods they got from the crash site and kept at home--yeah, loud and clear, they brought unidentified alien crash site objects home!  They bring it to some scientist with the theory that it's like ""a giant roach egg.""  These pods hatch out Alien facehugger-ripoffs.  They lunge and skitter across the floor just like them.  If I go by the movie, the best way to kill them is with a baseball bat.

Without any clues to get to the bottom of this, our cops turn to a meddlesome psychic (Julie Newmar) who randomly contacted them after the alien crashed.  This plot device feels pointless and forced, and the psychic is no less annoying than the cops.  I was really hoping the alien would win and kill all these losers.  No such luck.

In the finale, the cops hunt down a fully-metamorphosed alien.  We don't know if this is ""the queen"" or simply a developed adult.  They track it by the Alien calling card: clear, thick mucus-like ooze.  Either way, it had the general body form of an Alien with an elongate, exoskeleton-like head with no eyes.  It was hybridized with The Thing, having unevenly mangled teeth and a second toothy maw on its stomach, beside which are half a dozen rubbery, whip-like tendrils.

The final fight is pretty funny and pretty dumb.  Despite some heavy firearms, the creature was ultimately done in with a fireaxe, a chainsaw and a jar of Roach-B-Gone from a pest control company.  Thankfully, the credits started rolling within a minute of the creature's death to help numb the pain.

IF YOU LIKE THIS, WATCH:  Other campy Alien rip-offs include Contamination (1980) and the Tokyo Shock-esque Alien vs Ninja (2010).  Enjoy them both with an immature friend and some good beer.  Just want some cheesy 80s space madness?  Then try Galaxy of Terror (1981).",1327795200,2,3437,4.853448275862069
