7749023,1,B01F6EHOIK,"Take the money you would have used to get this ""animated"" movie and get the trade. The animation is poor and the voice acting is spotty at best.",1470441600,3,144,4.178571428571429
7749024,1,B01F6EHOIK,"The item description should have noted this was a ""slightly"" animated comic book and was not full animation.  It looks like the producers took the digital version of the comic book and added small,choppy movement.  Very poor.  The voice acting in some instances was good, in others, very poor.  Same for the dialog.  Not what I expected.  Very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money.",1470268800,21,390,4.907692307692308
7749025,1,B01F6EHOIK,"The animation style is either very retro or very cheap. Still images with moving lips, sometimes badly drawn. Again maybe it just the style, but it make it very hard to watch. Quit the movie after five minutes, may try again just for background noise.",1470182400,6,251,4.6
7749026,2,B01F6EHOIK,Not what I expected.  I thought it would be a full animated DVD but it was like a comic.  Bad graphics and worst story.,1470182400,2,119,3.9166666666666665
7749027,5,B01F6EHOIK,"This was one of the most amazing motion comics I ever saw! Gail Simone's work comes to life thanks to the amazing ShoutFactory!!! I'm not a big reader, so this is great for me!!",1465862400,8,177,4.235294117647059
7749028,1,B01F6EHOIK,Didn't like it.,1477958400,,15,4.333333333333333
7749029,1,B01F6EHOIK,"SO MUCH POTENTIAL, SOOOOOO BAD. THIS IS NOT ANIMATION. NOT SURE WHAT TO CALL IT. JUST POORLY DONE.",1477526400,,98,4.5
7749030,3,B01F6EHOIK,"Buy at your own risk , made to feel like a graphic novel . Bad writing , good art .",1475625600,,83,3.2
7749031,5,B01F6EHOIK,It's really good as far as story and sounds. I am not in comic animation but it is definitely worth to buy!,1475452800,4,107,3.909090909090909
7749032,1,B01F6EHOIK,"I love motion comics and wish they'd do more... when they're done we'll. This one... is not. I didn't expect a full animated movie like some of the posters here. Some people just do not know what a motion comic is. Computers are used to enhance the existing comic art to give it some ""motion"" and voice actors are brought in to replace the dialog bubbles.  There were a bunch of amazing Marvel ones done by Intec Interactive in the early 2000s. Seek them out. The Red Sonja motion comic is poorly done to the point of distraction. Voicework is all over the place. The dialog that might have worked in print simply does not when spoken. It's pretty horrible. Whoever did the scanning and animation of the comic art needs to know when to zoom and when not. If characters don't have faces drawn on them... don't zoom in for a closeup. The animation is horrible and not nearbsubtle enough for this type of endeavor. Simply put... a misfire at every step. I could barely make it 15 minutes before turning it off. Not recommended AT ALL.",1475193600,7,1031,4.48404255319149
7749033,1,B01F6EHOIK,I was looking forward to this but was disappointed in it when I watch it. With the tech we have now a days this should have been made a lot better then what it was. I feel the people who made this just used the name Red Sonja to make a quick buck and making it cheap.,1474675200,2,267,3.7017543859649122
7749034,1,B01F6EHOIK,"This was HORRIBLE. Its not a truly animated feature as it claims to be, The cover is actually from the comic book and is not at ALL representing how the animation in the film is- which was garbage. Its actually scenes from the comic with mild animation such as mouths moving. Its really a disgrace that anyone could argue this was an animation.",1474156800,,344,4.476190476190476
7749035,2,B01F6EHOIK,Based on the adventures found in the revived comic book. Unfortunately the animation (this style may be intentional as part of the overall scheme) seems to be poorly executed,1473465600,,174,5.0344827586206895
7749036,1,B01F6EHOIK,"complete garbage. not an animated feature, just a slightly animated comic. the dialog such as ""ye with the mighty cleavage"" is not only poorly written but poorly acted. this looks and sounds like a free web series circa 1998. what an utter disappointment. don't let the packaging fool you... this is not an animated feature. this is an extremely low quality motion comic. if I could give this less than 1 star... I would.",1472947200,,421,4.702702702702703
7749037,1,B01F6EHOIK,"Tough one. I brought it because of the good reviews. I couldn't stay awake, and perhaps I don't fully understand the storyline. I'm not a die hard comic guy, but have, and enjoyed other motion comics. But this was slow, and painful. To me, it was the same as IMHUMANS. Slow, and boring.",1472169600,,286,4.415094339622642
7749038,2,B01F6EHOIK,"As expected the quality of motion comics is bad. Trying to copy the 1966 Marvel Comics in my opinion. At least back then it was ok but with the newer technology watching a motion comic is in my opinion laziness. DC animated has set the example for years and never let watchers down.

I am a huge Conan / Red Sonja and I was very interested on the release of the Blu-Ray. Got home played the feature and fell asleep not once but three times. Very boring and Crom have mercy Boring.

Extras were simply extras. Nothing really interesting to watch over. Re watch value (null)",1471651200,,572,4.386792452830188
7749039,3,B01F6EHOIK,"A Red Sonja movie was surprising to see, so I decided to pick this up even though I'm not a huge fan of animated comic books. A good majority of the scenes were drawn/animated beautifully. However if the artwork was consistent throughout the movie it would have been better.
I enjoyed the dialog and voice acting. I think I'll try listening to it as an audio book. Do I recommend buying it? Yes, show your support. It's the only way we'll continue to get more than just the Big Two putting features out. I'm hopeful someday soon we'll get a full fledged Red Sonja animated feature. Thanks to all  that made this possible. Peace.",1471392000,,628,4.508771929824562
7749040,2,B01F6EHOIK,"I thought I was a fan of bad movies, but this...just wow.  voice acting was done in a tin can by incompetents, The artwork is the still production type, not animated.  It's not exactly well done in the art work.  It's blurry at times, not a lot of details, just shoddy work.  The story itself is the saving grace and worth two stars. I beg you, save your money or spend it more wisely on chewing gum or perhaps tossing into a wishing well.",1471392000,,439,4.190476190476191
7749041,2,B01F6EHOIK,"I was so upset when this started playing and saw that there was no actual animation! I waited a long time to see this and immediately regretted my purchase. If I want to see still pictures moved around and zoomed, I can do that with a comic book and my own two hands. I expect a lot more from an animated movie and wanted to see good fighting action sequences.",1471305600,2,360,4.1571428571428575
7749042,2,B01F6EHOIK,Has very poor animation and too long in developing the story.,1471132800,,61,4.636363636363637
7749043,5,B01F6EHOIK,"I have been a fan of Red Sonja since the 70's, and out of all the comic writers for the character over the years I think Gail Simone is the best.  I read this series when Dynamite put it out and was thrilled that it was going to made into a motion comic.  I think this story was a really good choice for long time fans as well as newcomers to the Red Sonja mythos, and I would love to see them make another one with ""The Art of Blood and Fire."" Now, as far as I can tell, the DVD only mentions that it is an animated comic on the back of the case at the bottom of the text where no one will see it.  As can be seen from the negative views for this film, a lot of people were unaware of this, and quite a few would not have bought this if they had know.  I can see how they would be disappointed with this thinking it was a fully animated film, and it really should have been marketed as such.  For those who are fine with motion comics, I will say that this is a cut above the typical motion comic, with a lot more motion and animation involved.  Also, I have see motion comics with only a single voice actor, which can be tricky.  As for the voice actors here, I liked them all, and I thought Misty Lee was the perfect Red Sonja.  There was a lot of nuance in her voice, as well as power, which combined with Gail Simone's dialogue made this movie a real pleasure to watch, and this will be one of the few DVD's I keep because I know I will watch it again.  The mini-documentary has some great interviews and is also worth watching.

In conclusion: if you are a fan of Red Sonja, Gail Simone, and a great motion comic with multiple voice actors, this film is the best!  Otherwise, your best bet is to keep moving along.",1471132800,4,1720,4.0
7749044,1,B01F6EHOIK,"I wish I would have read the reviews in this instance...but my love of the Red Sonja comics had me impulsively open my wallet and waste my money. I am not a fan of the type animation used for this picture and then paired with less than favorable art, dialog, and lack of continuity, I will be forced to re read the comic again to erase the fowl stench these stygian dogs have placed upon me so that I might retain my love of this red headed beauty we call Sonja.",1470960000,,462,4.087912087912088
7749045,2,B01F6EHOIK,"2 stars might be generous, but it was not all bad. First off, it is not fully animated but more in the style of a motion comic. The story is fine, but nothing amazing. If you are a fan of Gail Simone you might enjoy it more, but it just did not cut it for me. The dialogue is all over the place and, at times, is just really poor. Some decent battles can not save it.
It is a shame because it could have been really good. Skip it, unless you are a fan of Gail Simone or you get it for free.",1470614400,5,490,3.7211538461538463
7749046,1,B01F6EHOIK,"Probably the worst movie I even saw.  Horrible animation, idiotic dialogue, etc.  Disc is likely to become a target.",1470528000,,116,5.052631578947368
7749047,2,B01F6EHOIK,"I awaited this purchase with anticipation, having been a fan of the works of Robert Howard since childhood, with a particular fondness for Red Sonja, and possessing an admiration for the comic book interpretations of her. Perhaps I expected too much, but my viewing of this product was one of great disappointment-- artwork that at times was quite poorly rendered, a mixed bag of voice acting performances, and some dialogue that would've been cut from a twelve year old's fan fiction by the writer themselves. However, like the Red Sonja film, this will not diminish my love of this character and her exploits, except for those of the creators of this sorry endeavor. There is some good news from this experience, though-- I nearly pre-ordered the Blu Ray as my Brother's Christmas gift.",1470441600,8,788,4.932330827067669
8760259,1,B01F6EHOIK,A real piece of junk.  Terrible and cheap animation.  Save your money.,1532131200,,70,4.75
8760260,5,B01F6EHOIK,A nice story,1520208000,,12,3.3333333333333335
8760261,1,B01F6EHOIK,"This ""movie"" is absolute garbage. There's no other way to say it. The story is okay, adapted directly from Gail Simone's comic book mini-series, but the animation is atrocious! To be fair, it's not real animation, but a ""motion-comic,"" which is somewhat irritating. There seem to be three separate styles of art involved. One is fairly decent comic book art, with smooth lines, solid, sharp colors, and an understanding of human anatomy. Then there's the second art, that looks more like rough pencils, unfinished and quickly colored in the same rough style. Then there is the last kind of ""art,"" that looks like a blind person was given a pen, paper, and three colored pencils and told to draw random, vaguely human shapes. The most common seems to be the middle style, the rough pencil look, although the film flashes back and forth between all three seemingly at random. That and the lack of real animation make this a very hard movie to watch for it's entire one hour and fourteen minutes. Save yourself a lot of visual anguish and read the trade paperback this is based on instead.",1499212800,,1086,4.751322751322752
8760262,5,B01F6EHOIK,"Ok, the animation was not state of the art, but obviously they did not have the money for full animation, however the voice acting and story were superb. If you love Red Sonja this is an excellent addition to any collection.",1491004800,,224,4.487804878048781
8760263,5,B01F6EHOIK,Nice movie based on old time comics.,1489363200,,36,4.285714285714286
8760264,3,B01F6EHOIK,I was expecting better it reminded me of clutch Cargo where the lips only moved and the body stiff good story i wish better on the next one if they make the other stories,1487980800,,170,4.029411764705882

8760267,5,B01F6EHOIK,"I was skeptical when I first bought this because of the reviews, but I enjoyed watching this. Yes - This is a motion comic. So if you are not into that, then don't watch it instead of just leaving a bad review. Because it is a motion comic, I didn't expect super high end imagery that people seem to love and expect now-a-days. So I saw what I expected to see. There is some corny dialogue in it, but nothing that can't be handled. The plot and plot twists were enough to keep me interested. This is worth the buy and has been added to my vast anime collection.",1483056000,2,561,4.155963302752293
