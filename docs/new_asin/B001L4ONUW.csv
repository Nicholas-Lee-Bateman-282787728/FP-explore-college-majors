Layers failed (In my mind ) to be addressed enough. I am interested in fine tuning my photographs utilizing the most powerful feature of 7,not adding text to something I will more the likely never use.

All said and done however, the DVD did offer some insight into the workings of Elements 7.

I am particularly disappointed with the video quality. The menu system on the right of screen is out of focus & barely readable.

I was over charged on the stated freight price & a non accurate exchange rate was used for calculating the price

The content did reach the pass mark",1240444800,,287,4.480769230769231

It was nice learning how layers work and how to create header graphics that I plan to use on a blog. This DVD is an EXCELLENT resource and I highly recommend it. It is the best stuff I have seen for Photoshop Elements.

I knew next to nothing about this software and now I am able to do lots of different things with it. Thanks so much!",1238457600,,605,4.252173913043478
8317221,2,B001L4ONUW,"I was very disappointed in this dvd, I thought I would be well on my way to restoring some old photos , I found very minimal lessons on the topic, I would have felt better paying more for a complete instruction dvd rather than a few lessons. I did however found the few lessons helpful to a point.",1237334400,,297,4.137931034482759
8317222,5,B001L4ONUW,"This video is amazing!  I am a visual person and ""looking over Mr. Graham's shoulder"" is just what I needed.  He makes it easy to do because I can see him do it.  He has given me the incentive to try something new, like making a calendar or greeting cards.  The examples are clear and take me from start to finish.  What a neat way of presenting things.  I especially liked the way you could move that ball around and make it perfect.  Even in black and white!  Thanks for all the help!!",1231113600,,487,4.161290322580645
