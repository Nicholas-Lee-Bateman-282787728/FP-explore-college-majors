I thought Luno was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I even remembered the chant that brought the little statue of Luno to life: ""Winged Horse of marble white, take me on a magic flight!""  *Poof* The full sized Luno appears!  :-)

Luno is a terrific cartoon for small children. Simply drawn, easily understood and gently rendered. Unlike the frenetic, buzy cartoons we have today. (How DO some of them get produced?) The horse takes his owner, Tim, on magical visits to other lands and times. Reviewing history and culture in a fun, entertaining way for small children.  It is a great way to get little kids interested in history and world culture.

Luno inspired me to pursue art.  I loved Luno so much, I fashioned my own drawings of winged horses after him. I drew them for years throughout grade school and high school. Luno will always have a special place in my heart where all my favorite cartoons still live.",1034294400,6,1083,4.556701030927835
