2062674,5,B00024E6BS,"I can't better any of the more in-depth reviews posted here so I won't bother to try! I only wish to raise one point. Like an earlier reviewer I have an extensive list of music DVDs (Rush, Yes, Dream Theater, Led Zeppelin etc.) and I have watched them all to varying degrees of repetition with one exception...
Lex Live stands head and shoulders above all my DVDs irrespective of quality of sound, lighting, camera work and all the other marks that DVDs are ""supposed"" to hit for one reason and that reason is sheer enjoyment! The music is heart-felt and performed with consumate skill and the performance is nothing short of addictive. I've had this disc on constant rotation since I bought it (in fact, when I watch a movie on DVD, Lex Live comes out, the movie goes in and then Lex Live goes back in again once the movie's over!)
With Lex Live being constantly played in preference to Yes, Genesis or Led Zeppelin, I'll let you draw your own conclusions...",1090108800,9,959,4.5491329479768785
2062675,5,B00024E6BS,"OK, I usually am not a fan of DVD concerts and so I wasn't going to buy this one at first.  But, after I heard so much about it and knew there was behind the scene stuff from NEARfest 2003 (which I attended) I figured it might be worth getting.
I wasn't really sure what to expect on this DVD and so I didn't really hurry to play it when it arrived.  How wrong I was to underestimate these guys!  From the very first song on the disc I was totally captivated by the performance.  (maybe because I've seen them play before?)  Originally I brought some laundry out with me to fold while I watched it and, well, the laundry got the short end of the stick.
Watching these guys play live (on the DVD) is a real treat even without any kind of surround sound or anything, just a normal TV.  I think it sounded great and I don't remember having any trouble picking out the voices or the parts.  Yes, Rythm and Brews is small but it seemed to be a nice little setting for them and the camera work is very good and clear with good closeups and views of the stage (unlike sitting in a real concert, you get to see stuff on the DVD)  Also, the behind the scenes work is a treat because you kinda get to meet the band and you just wish you were there for that hotel performance.
I found this very enjoyable for my first concert DVD.",1090022400,4,1319,4.1050583657587545
2062676,5,B00024E6BS,"Excellent work!  An enjoyable watch!  This DVD showcases the incredible talent that Glass Hammer possesses, from beautiful vocals of Susie Bogdanowicz and other GH singers Flo Paris, Bethany Warren, and Sarah Snyder, rocking bass lines from Steve Babb, and unblieveable keyboard solos from Fred Schendel. Not to mention an awesome drum solo from new memeber Matt Mendians.  A great filming for an incredible set, including most of the music from Lex Rex and a few songs from Chronometree, culminating with a powerful rendition of ""Heaven"", that leaves the viewer's mind echoing the triumphant cry: ""Above!""  The performance is excellent, as is the music, with bright, crisp vocals all throughout in intricate harmonies.
Still, my favorite part of the DVD is the special features.  The footage of the eight musicians crammed into a hotel room (which they claim is bigger than their practice room in Chattanooga) filled with beautitful music chronicles the highlight of the NEARfest performance for several members of the band.  Interviews at a prescreening party gives a look at some of the newer members, and the band's humor carries throughout especially as Steve and Fred show off their equipment to a camera passed back and forth between them.  A personal favorite of mine, the DVD offers a small clip of Jon-Michael Babb, an adorable  2-year-old with a head of curls, working the taurus pedals.  Part of a fan's bootleg of NEARfest also shows up, with a small preview of the band with the large choir.
All and all, this DVD is a great buy, both for current fans of Glass Hammer, or those who want to check out the greatest American band on the prog scene!",1090022400,3,1659,4.938848920863309
2062677,5,B00024E6BS,"If you're not familiar with Glass Hammer, they have a textured, layered approach to creating their own brand of modern progressive music with their own very unique style.  They take a very meticulous approach to ensure that every CD (and now DVD) is of the highest quality in terms of musicianship - this includes how they structure their melodies, harmonies, counterpoint, timbre, and rythym.  This is not Top 40 material but rather well-crafted music intended to stimulate the mind as well as the ear.  As a fan, I was delighted to finally see a live DVD so I could ""rewind"" and catch details I missed from earlier viewings.  Having listened to Lex Rex the CD, I was skeptical that they could pull off the wall of sound's majesty in a live setting.  I was completely wrong!  Not only do they bring to the fore the skilled musicianship and clean, crisp sound of Lex Rex, the DVD captures the energy and charisma of a live performance.  Well Done!  Give us more!",1090022400,3,962,4.617647058823529
2062678,3,B00024E6BS,"First of all let me set a baseline for this review.  I am comparing this DVD to other live DVD's that I have purchased, which I would rate at a 4 to 5 rating. Those DVD's are from the following bands: Jethro Tull, Kansas, ELP, Yes, Journey, Styx, Transatlantic and Toto.
I purchased this DVD solely on the reviews places on this website. I had never heard Glass Hammer until my DVD arrived and I watched the concert.  Let me also say that I am a big fan of good musicianship, and become an even bigger fan when the lyrical content of the songs is something that I believe to be important; so when I read the previous reviews of this DVD I became very excited and placed my order.
Lets address the audio portion.  This DVD causes me to have a deeper appreciation for the talent and expertise needed to engineer and mix a ""top"" quality live DVD.  In each of the other live DVD'S I listed above with a 4 to 5 rating, the instrumental and vocal recordings are mixed in a way that each individual part can be heard and appreciated.  I am able to distinguish the melody line from the harmony line, or two or three different instrumental lead lines from each other as they musically intertwine throughout the songs.
Unfortunately that is not the case on this DVD.  The audio portion seems to come as an overwhelming wall of sound.  At times I could see that several people would be singing, and yet I couldn't begin to tell you what any of the songs were about because the melody and words were buried somewhere in that wall.  That was very disappointing to me considering the content of the lyrics.  I was looking forward to hearing and understanding the words to these epic songs.  At one point I decided to focus on the bass playing, so I attempted to listed to the actual musicianship, and tone of the bass.  Well, I couldn't hear enough to tell if the bass player was good or not, and when he changed basses for a different sound, I couldn't hear a distinguishable change - still a wall of sound.  In addition, the drums sounded flat!  That was no more evident than during the drum solo when the drummer sounded like he was playing on a set of small oatmeal boxes.  Drum solos, if they are going to be played and recorded need to sound big, not like they are being played ten miles away without amplification or effects.  On the other hand, the keyboards were big and distinguishable. However, they were just too loud.  I know it sounds like I'm impossible to please, but some of the other bands that I rated a 4 to 5 also play very busy and intricate music, and they managed to get a quality audio mix.
Finally, I have to acknowledge that Glass Hammer is playing at a much smaller venue, and is obviously working on a much smaller budget than the bands on my other live DVD's.  Thus, the lighting and camera work aren't as good, the stage is small and crowded, and there is no drum riser.  That in itself is worth about .5 in my rating.
Obviously, opinions differ; and if I had had the chance to view and listen to this DVD prior to purchasing it, I wouldn't have purchased it.  I would have been intrigued by it, but I wouldn't have purchased it.",1089936000,4,3146,4.3561643835616435
2062679,5,B00024E6BS,This is truly an amazing dvd. The concert is fantastic and the special features are worth every bit as much as the actual video. I would recommend this to anyone who likes prog.,1087689600,,177,4.393939393939394
2062680,5,B00024E6BS,"I just had the opportunity to experience this DVD on a 12 foot screen with concert level sound.
I am honestly speechless! I considered the cd ""Lex Rex"" a modern day masterpiece of progressive rock music.
I had wondered if Glass Hammer were studio wizards or could they achieve this incredible sound and energy in a live performance?
""Lex Live"" answers my question. I now count Glass Hammer among the few bands that are able to take a studio masterpiece and perform it on stage to a higher level than the original recording. Yes, Pink Floyd, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Peter Gabriel can do it and so can Glass Hammer! This was one of the finest performances of music that I have ever seen! All I can say is WOW! I still have goose bumps. I promise that I will be traveling to wherever the next Glass Hammer concert is. Thank you Glass Hammer for keeping the flame for progressive rock alive.",1087603200,4,888,4.487654320987654
2062681,5,B00024E6BS,"I was fortunate enough to see Glass Hammer perform this set at NEARfest 2003. It was an incredible experience and they've decided to do (basically) the same show again so all can see it. From the first notes you will be captivated by the music. When they do their latest CD, at the time, Lex Rex, you can't stop listening and the way it flows into Heaven from Perelandra is magical. I would have loved for this to be in full 5.1 surround, but it sounds great anyway. And it should. Glass Hammer are becoming known as the guys to go to for mixing music. I highly recommend the DVD.",1087430400,,580,4.281818181818182
2062682,5,B00024E6BS,"having received a signed copy of the dvd last week,i decided to watch it -using my pioneer NS DVD 1000 home cinema/hi fi set up.the sound quality -whilst not in 5.1 DTS or Dolby Surround ,is phenomenal.
the drums and bass really kick through and freds keyboard playing is out of this world.the camera angles let you see what is going on ,particularly in the long instumental passages.
my only downside is that the sound level of the 3/4 female backing singers could have been a little higher in the mix.not that this detracts from the splendid performance by the band.
walter moore is going for a ""dave gilmour "" circa 1973 with his excellent guitar playing.
the extras give you a small insight into the preparation (in a hotel room ) for the vocal arrangements,together with a dvd release party introducing the band.
my favourite bit is when fred takes a small video camera around the stage pre show and none of steves bass pedals work - nice !
all in all a wonderful permanent statement from one of todays foremost musical ensembles.",1086134400,2,1035,4.630434782608695
2062683,5,B00024E6BS,"Last year, upon hearing that Glass Hammer was on the card for the NorthEastern Art Rock Festival (NEARfest), I resolved to go, thinking simultaneously that music of the complexity Glass Hammer records must be nearly impossible to perform live, and that a 51-year-old man at a two-day rock concert was an essay topic even without reference to the music.

As things turned out, personal developments compelled me to miss NEARfest 2003. It was a pity for several reasons, all of which are beyond the scope of this review. But just yesterday, a DVD arrived in the mail from Sound Resources of Chattanooga, Tennessee: a reviewer's copy of Lex Live, a filmed Glass Hammer concert at the Rhythm 'N' Brews music club in that city.

I was somewhat surprised. Still, I'd exchanged some very pleasant letters with Fred Schendel and Steve Babb, the creative nucleus of Glass Hammer, after I recommended their magnificent 2002 release Lex Rex, so I thrust away the suspicion that the DVD had been sent to me by mistake.

One way or the other, I am supremely glad to have received it.

The concert at Rhythm 'N' Brews was an event of singular quality. Even rock groups that perform comparatively simple music frequently bobble their notes or their lines on stage. Not Glass Hammer! Despite the terrifying complexity of the selections they played, I couldn't detect a single wrong note, nor a single misstep in rhythm.

The concert led off with the ""Chronotheme"" from their Chronometree album, a rousing retro-prog piece reminiscent of early Keith Emerson, but with more wit and less self-referential flash. After a brief pause, the group swung directly into Lex Rex, the prog-rock oratorio that has stunned the progressive music world.

The performance was a revelation and a delight. I'd wondered how a symphonic-progressive composition like Lex Rex could be brought out of the studio and onto the stage. Its multi-layered composition, contrapunctal, cannonaded vocals, and all-around difficulty seemed too daunting to approach live. The studio allows musicians to correct many a misstep before their audience ever hears it; the stage is entirely unforgiving.

There was nothing to forgive. There was energy, and virtuosity, and beauty, and joy.

The Schendel-Babb ""nucleus"" was joined onstage by:
-- Guitarist / vocalist Walter Moore,
-- Acoustic guitarist / bassist Eric Parker,
-- Drummer Matt Mendians,
-- Vocalists Susie Bogdanowicz, Bethany Warren, Flo Paris, and Sarah Snyder.

The performance of Lex Rex was slightly altered by the necessities of a concert setting -- few rock clubs have two grand pianos available at any moment -- but it came off as perfectly as if it had been written to be performed onstage in the first place. Woven into its midsection was another selection from Chronometree: ""Chronos Deliverer,"" which has a soaring choral vocal quite in keeping with the exalted story of Lex Rex. The concert ended with ""Heaven"" from the Perelandra album, another spiritually stirring and quite appropriate piece.

As videography, Lex Live isn't a masterwork, but then, it was never intended to be. It's essentially a straight depiction of an extraordinary performance of an extraordinary body of work, very sparingly enhanced in post-production with gentle special effects here and there. That should be quite enough.

As thrilled as I was to see this concert captured this way, it made me doubly sad to have missed NEARfest, where I might have had the chance to meet these nine fantastic musicians and congratulate them on their achievements.

If you enjoy filmed concerts and complex, thematically rich modern music, you'll love Lex Live. I guarantee it. You'll never again see virtuosity of the level of Fred Schendel, Steve Babb, Walter Moore, and Matt Mendians, as captured on this disc. Nowhere else will you hear modern music of this difficulty, performed live to this standard of excellence. And no matter how long you live or where you go, you'll never in your life see beauty or joy to compare with the face of Susie Bogdanowicz as she sings with Glass Hammer.

8022196,2,B00024E6BS,"The music is good, the ""stage"" is crowded, it actually reminds me of a garage band. I actually cant bring myself to watch this, I use as a ""cd"" while I watch sports on tv. Extremely low budget production, if there is a live audience I haven't seen them. Do yourself a favor, enjoy Glass Hammer on cd, you DONT want to see these guys live. There are MANY more negative things I could say about presentation. I wish I had the cd to bring on road trips in the car. Music 4 stars, video 0 stars.",1337644800,,491,4.072164948453608
8022197,3,B00024E6BS,"I've been listening to the studio album Lex Rex for almost a year and it is amazing. When I found out there was a live version of it, I bought it right away. I have just finished watching the entire thing and here are my thoughs. First of all, these guys can play their asses off and the sound quality is one hundred percent all of the above top notch. But if you want to just hear that, buy the album. When you buy a concert DVD, you expect more than just good music.

I know this isn't a fashion show but these guys look lame. These look like the guys you think of who sit in their mom's basement and play world of warcraft all day. If I were going to perform a concert, let alone one that would be filmed, I would dress in my best clothes and look like it was an important occasion. These guys look like they are dressed to go to Burger King or something.

The girls have nice voices and are pretty decent looking but they don't need to be here. They sit with their legs crossed and hands folded and just look bored. The band can be playing mind shattering riffs and their face expressions always remain the same. I bet they went home that night and listened to Britney Spears. The camera man also seems to have a massive hard on for the blonde because the camera is ALWAYS on her. She is even front and center on the DVD cover, making it almost seem like she is the lead vocalist or something. She looks very nervous and twitches A LOT.

Speaking of which, this drummer is definately on crack. He makes the most strange facial expressions when he plays like he is about to cry then he squints his eyes and starts shaking like crazy FOR THE ENTIRE CONCERT! It was very disturbing to watch him to say the least. He plays like a god though.

There is a back up guitarist who remains hidden for pretty much the whole show. I didn't notice him till about the halfway point. I'm guessing the camera man was too busy lusting over the blonde backup vocalist and completely forgot about him.

So, the music is great but the visuals are pretty disturbing. Maybe I'm just being too much of a critic but I am very distracted by the cartoon-like characters here. I don't reccomend this DVD. I reccomend you just buy the album.",1293494400,,2217,4.2565320665083135
8022198,4,B00024E6BS,"Their best live act on stage, witnessing both the ""golden period"" regarding ""Chronometree"" and ""Lex Rex"" (above all this latter for its importance as a personal ""emulation of their own"" concerning the music of ELP and Yes)- which is well worth checking out after all!!
Certainly We are just a little bit disappointed after the controversial album ""Three Cheers For The Broken-Hearted"", whose music and ensemble as well (apart from the good vocalist Susan) could be their definitive choice for the future  and I don't know whether it's satisfying or less, talking about the preferences of the old fans...well I hope that They will be able to produce such a good stuff like that unique of the early period (even though you could prefer the old stuff live by the original Yes, but nevermind...). However the present performance within an interesting DVD such as ""Lex Live"", is an important example of their skill live. Unfortunately their technique has been forgotten in the recent times, but probably the new ensemble of G.H. is looking for a personal music path and a new place too, within the modern progressive world (for me too it's the same, cause I know- as a musician and symphonic composer- how difficult it is, nowadays!!)...

Moreover I like to make a special mention both for the beautiful album cover and the good video and sound master as well...anyway, perhaps the new ensemble will decide to come back to their roots and the present ""Lex Live"" won't be an episode apart concerning their career! So you can buy it, at the end!",1274227200,,1538,4.821969696969697
8022199,4,B00024E6BS,"Solid progressive music influenced by Yes and ELP with the emphasis on Emerson. All musicians are top notch. Of note is the wizard on keyboards, the true heart of the band. The female background singers add a nice touch and each song is a musical journey which is the way it should be. One star was deducted for displaying all the classic symptoms of Dream Theater and Flower King disease-- too much meandering and dabbling in the instrumental parts- some are too extended and could benefit from editing. A good DVD that should be in all progressive music fan's collections. There is only a handful of American prog bands and this one along with the Hoax and Illuvator are the best.",1125014400,7,682,4.644628099173554
8022200,5,B00024E6BS,"I ordered this DVD with a little risk considering I'd never heard the band's music before, however, I really enjoyed my introduction to the band.

For fans of complex music, performed by serious musicians, this concert is highly recommended. The production of the film itself is unique and interesting. First, the main performance gives fans and those who've never heard the band the idea that this band puts more practice and thought into their efforts.

The show's direction is fabuluous in that you see all performers involved equally, with great views of individual highlights. Plus, the behind the scenes footage really leaves the impression that the band is very close with one another and enjoys what they do.

For those who haven't heard the band, I can only compare them to bands that highlight every instrument. There are no sloppy musicians in this band whatsoever, nor any sloppy performances during this particular show. Personally, the best sounding Magellan material comes to mind, as well as maybe the hardest sounding Yes material.

For those who have heard and liked the band's sound, this DVD couldn't be recommended more. Though in my opinion the music is more in focus than the lyrics/vocals, but what vocal parts are used in the show are great. It's also fun to see nearly every member of the band involved in the lead singing. And though I'm not normally a big fan of female singers or in this case back-up singers, Glass Hammer uses female vocals to their benefit. Their vocal performances help enhance their already glorious sound. This band is for anyone into technical, yet pleasing sounding music. I have to recommend this DVD with 5 stars.",1109289600,5,1668,4.925266903914591
8022201,5,B00024E6BS,"Curiosity got the best of me when Amazon recommended this DVD, and having read the reviews I decided to buy it. You know how you get a feeling about certain bands even though you haven't heard them? Well, intuition certainly worked this time! My only complaint is that Rythym N' Brews is too small a venue to hold this much talent. The place must have been literally ready to explode! The musicianship is outstanding and takes professionalism to a new level. Thank God for the internet, for I probably never would have discovered Glass Hammer ( what a shame )without it. I also connect with their Christian themes, although non Christians can certainly be awed these wonderful musicians. ENJOY!",1096156800,3,694,4.840336134453781
8022202,5,B00024E6BS,"I'm blown away!!! As a long time progressive music fan I can only say: AWESOME!!!. I think this will turn into one of the Classic DVDs in the genre. The lush and complexity of this music is just thight and perfect, mainly in the venue of Epics Yes style, and executed by Virtuoso musicians. The cute girls in the backing vocals do an excellent job and garnish the scene with simplicity and beauty. Needless to detail the excelscitud of the musicians: need to see it to believe it. They deliver accurately and without gadgets or hesitation. This does not seem a big budget producction. Nevertheless, the picture is high quality, the sound well mixed, making it all together a Proffessional Masterpiece. Now, when you go to the bonuses and the interviews you'll be amazed by the humbleness of the Band and Crew: pure every-day americans.",1093392000,2,835,4.76551724137931
8022203,5,B00024E6BS,"Glass Hammer is considered one of the leading Progressive Bands of the USA.  Actually, at their studio recordings they are the two-man project of Steve Bapp and Fred Schendel.  On Lex Live they perform as a complete five-member ensemble with three female background singers.  They do contain the essental musical resources to convey the compexity of their arrangements, also when appearing live.  Recordings of their album Lex Rex make up the bulk of their concert.  By including the bonus section of their DVD, - among others the Tales of the Great War video, - two hours suffice as running time.
All in all, a highly recommendable live DVD rendered by a first class band.",1090195200,4,673,4.868421052631579
