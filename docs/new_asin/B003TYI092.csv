4192993,4,B003TYI092,"Here's a film which I read about in Famous Monsters magazine when I was all of ten years old and never got to view until now and it was worth the wait. The film looks like it belongs back in the fifties borrowing heavily from William Castle's 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL' but has a unique spirit(no pun intended) of its own. Connie Stevens in a great dual role as both mother and daughter owns the film as the executor of the will of the estate of Cesar Romero ( a year before his stint as the Joker on the 'BATMAN' T.V. series) as illusionist Duke Duquesne who must spend seven days in his gloomy mansion in order to collect $300,000 and see him return from the grave.  A pre-Disney Dean Jones is the love interest who really shows his underrated acting abilities and gives the film a James Stewart quality. Fans will also recognize John Hoyt and a blink or you'll miss cameo from Richard Kiel(Jaws in the Roger Moore Bond films).  Actor/Director William Conrad and suspense writer Henry Slesar's script pour on the cliches and spooky hi-jinks making the film a must for horror and suspense fans. The icing on the cake is one of the last orchestral film scores of the great Max Steiner.  Available as a DVD-R from Warner Archive and now from Amazon.com, its a beautiful transfer and worth the price tag.",1290211200,13,1299,4.495762711864407
4192994,5,B003TYI092,"VERY excited to FINALLY get this classic on DVD after ALL these years!! Did not think twice when I heard this is Warner Brothers DVD-R. I have THE MAN WHO LOVES CAT DANCING from them on a DVD-R and I could not tell from the 'factory pressed' ones. The transfer on CAT DANCING looks great and It's anamorphic widescreen (finally!) after all these years looking at the pan and scan version on video and tv. Who cares 'how' these are made as long as they are from the legit studios who owns them and not copies from videotape! Enjoy these classics now that they are here on DVD. I am sure the widescreen transfer of Guillotine will be fine...Enjoy!
After finally getting a chance to watch this classic (sorry Twilight Zone on blu ray took too much time) the picture is outstanding for being made in the mid-60s. The black and white photography is detailed. And the widescreen really captures the suspense...there is so much room in the frame! Before everything was 'cramped' from the panning and scanning. I am so thankful that Warner finally released this classic on video in its original 2.35 aspect ratio. Just wished it has some supplemental extras...oh,well. Still a five-star rating!!",1284076800,17,1187,4.739130434782608
4192995,1,B003TYI092,"I remember enjoying this film when I'd catch it on TV during the '60's in Chicago IL. I was excited to see it had been released on DVD but a perusal of the details denotes another bird entirely. This is a DVD-R, the cheap kissing cousin of a DVD and Amazon.com supplies a note stating it may not play on devices other than a straight forward DVD player. I think a price tag of no more than $12 would be appropriate. Until that day, expect this item to fly off the shelves like Obama buttons at a Republican tea party.",1282003200,10,517,4.18
4192996,5,B003TYI092,"I purchased this at Warner Archives where it is still available. It's supposedly been re-mastered and is a DVD-R. It looks clear enough but has a slight softness to the picture. It's still in great condtion and very watchable nonetheless. For any horror fan of a certain age who has never seen 1965's ""Two on a Guillotine"" here's your chance. For any fan period. For those not old enough to remember it, it's a B&W and non-gory old house shocker. It's wonderfully campy by today's standards and it does involve a guillotine. Sixties cutie Connie Stevens plays two roles, Cesar Romero plays a mad magician/Grand Guignol illusionist and Dean Jones is a reporter out for a scoop. When her father, the Great Duquesne (Romero), dies, his will stipulates Stevens must spend 7 nights in his supposedly haunted mansion to get her inheritance. The Great Duquesne also stated he would come back from the grave. Of course, she's then subjected to a house of horrors complete with a mysterious locked room whose key has been buried with her father. Romero is excellent in a role Vincent Price would have had a field day with. Stevens does her two roles (playing both mother and daughter) appropriately and is a great screamer and Dean Jones is, well, Dean Jones. Everyone overacts and over re-acts to a degree and there are maybe a few too many cutesy moments, but this is still enjoyable and completely harmless entertainment in a ghoulish sense. And the guillotine is quite grand. Enjoy.",1277769600,34,1477,4.818897637795276

4193009,4,B003TYI092,"Director William Conrad reasonably ratchets up the atmospherics in his house of horrors picture.  For sure the twist ending delivers the goods.  What I can't help thinking is this film could have been so much better if it were tightened up a bit making it more effective.

the will specifies she must stay in her father's house for a week to get the inheritance. lots of twists to the movie. we eventually find out that the mother died when a guillotine tick failed and killed her.

just campy enough to be right for the genre.",1438473600,,506,4.315789473684211

4193034,3,B003TYI092,"""Two On A Guillotine"" looks for all the world like a WiIliam Castle spook epic, but it's not. Its actually a bit too mild to match up to one of Mr C's works, which is saying something. However if you are a fan of things like ""House on Haunted Hill"", you should enjoy this.

There's a very slim plot: perky Connie Stevens plays Cassie, called to the funeral and will-reading of her eccentric father who was a famous magician, although the two had been strangers for many years before his mysterious death. The will states that Cassie must spend 7 nights in her fathers mansion or lose the inheritance, which will instead to go two housekeepers. And as soon as she moves in spooky things start happening..will she be frightened into to leaving the house or clever enough to work out who is behind it?

Talk about the creakiest of old plots! There's really nothing in the plot to get excited about, although at least the script does not paint the characters as idiots - Cassie (and her protector/suitor) find out almost straight away that the spooky occurrences are being faked, so at least that's one plot twist out of the way. But who is doing it and why? Again, as I said, there's not much plot to go around and there are hardly any characters in the cast, so guessing the truth is not that hard.

However I still enjoyed the movie. It's nicely shot, in widescreen crisp black and white (well, mostly crisp, as focus goes off now and again), and the dialogue is entertaining. Soem shots are actually very stylish, and there's a pretty cool sequence set in a noisy nightclub that culminates in an embrace, which is set up very strangely, but I really liked how they did it. There's very little to actually scare you, although there is a bit of fun to be found in a couple of ""body horror"" effects (I'm trying not to reveal what they are!)

Curiously I've been seeking out kooky horror movies my whole life and had never even heard of this film until now (2014), which shows how hard to find it has been, Thankfully now released on the Warner Archive label, it;s a lovely looking print, and worth getting if you like not-too-serious 1960's chillers.",1394582400,5,2147,4.525773195876289
4193035,4,B003TYI092,"The movie itself is great. However it won't play in my player. I gave it to a friend who also loves this movie.  I wouldn't try it from this seller, he can't supply me with a copy that will play.",1393200000,,195,3.875
4193036,5,B003TYI092,"Great mid-60's mystery with some light touches.  Connie Stevens plays a young woman who inherits a spooky old mansion from her estranged magician father with the stipulation that she spends seven nights there.  There are some truly creepy moments, especially when the door knob turns to some ominous background music.  The black and white photography is excellent, as are many films from that era.  Though this is a DVD-R it is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1392508800,,467,5.173333333333333
4193037,5,B003TYI092,My husband heard about this movie and found it on Amazon so we purchased it.  We really like Dean Jones and Connie Stevens and were pleasantly surprised at the movie!,1392076800,,166,4.533333333333333
4193038,4,B003TYI092,"Saw this as a kid, and have loved it ever since. A young Dean Jones (Herbie the Love Bug) and beautiful Connie Stevens (Maverick) stay in the scary house of her famous magician father, Caesar Romero (TV Batman's Joker), after his death, in order to receive a $300,000 inheritance. But what is behind the locked door at the top of the stairs? Is it the magician's manager or his long time nurse trying to scare the daughter out, so that they can claim the inheritance? Or, did the magician actually return after death? And what ever happened to Connie's mom, who looks exactly like Connie? And then, there's the rabbit...

4193047,5,B003TYI092,"I remember seeing this movie when I was 14 years old.  Knew it was a horror picture involving a guillotine, but I couldn't remember the subject matter!  It did not disappoint; in fact, they don't make movies like this anymore with background music more intense than the plot.  Music director Max Steiner played an arpeggio toward the middle of the movie from an upper key all the way down to a lower register that was so stunning I sat wondering ""Wow!  With what instruments did he play that?!""  I couldn't remember stars Connie Stevens, Cesar Romero and Dean Jones and that actor William Conrad directed it; it's therefore no wonder this movie stood out in my memory 43 years!

It has two adorable actors, Dean Jones and Connie Stevens, in their prime. The story is well written. I certainly wouldn't consider it a ""B"" movie, and imdb.com gives it a decent 6.0 rating. The wonderful Cesar Romero has a relatively small but integral part. The film was directed by the well known actor and TV director William Conrad. I envy anyone seeing the film for the first time, since it is a mystery. However, I hadn't seen it for many years so it was almost like seeing for the first time.

It couldn't be that unusually shaped tower house! (Benidict Castle, still there)
It has a staircase in a scene to match that shape.

4193061,5,B003TYI092,"William Conrad, the mellifluent baritone and star of ""Cannon,"" ""Nero Wolfe"" and ""Jake and the Fatman"" was once a prolific director and producer, but always a consummate entertainer.  He directed three films in 1965 for Warner Bros. and they have shown up one by one on Warner Archive.  ""Brainstorm"" starring Jeffrey Hunter and Anne Francis was a little dated when it was released, and old-fashioned studio picture, but still entertaining.  ""Two on a Guillotine"" (starring Connie Stevens and Dean Jones) and ""My Blood Runs Cold"" (which starred Troy Donahue and Joey Heatherton) were directed more at the teen audience.  I prefer ""Two on a Guillotine"" as ""My Blood Runs Cold"" sort of had Troy Donahue showing why his contract would not be picked up soon after in a rather distasteful role.  But ""Two on a Guillotine"" had the genuine engaging casting of Connie and Dean Jones and some nice touches mixing humor and Grand Guignol.  There is a Hitchcock kiss that is worth the cost of the DVD alone as the group, The Condors wail ""Go, Baby"" in a discotheque.  This Warner Archive edition is remastered and quite watchable, but wish they had included the trailer as an extra, but that did not happen.  A screen gem.",1328486400,5,1209,4.806763285024155
4193062,5,B003TYI092,"This is one of the most fantastic movies of the 60's - Dean and Connie are perfect for the parts.  Its beautifully photographed and the script is excellent.  It has horror, romance, comedy, action and suspense.  I absolutely love this film - I have loved it since the first time I saw it !!! It showcases the talents of the major players very well and even William Conrad, the director, is very Hitchcockian in that he allows himself to be in one of the scenes. I would watch this film over and over and I think you should too !!!.",1321833600,3,531,4.29
4193063,4,B003TYI092,"Feel this is one movie I would let young teens watch as it is a good clean movie.  Nothing like today's where they are filled with filthy language and scenes and 'blood and guts', bombs and assault rifles.

Remebered this movie from my younger years, particularly one scene --remember the entire theatre just exploding in one scream and the results of that particular date. Enjoyed being able to go back in time to that one very wonderful night.  Only wish my date of that evening were here to enjoy this movie with me.",1306540800,,519,4.559139784946237

4193065,1,B003TYI092,"Granted, I bought this cold with little knowledge of the film, but MAN!  Almost nothing happens for 95% of it, with lots of goofy ""meet cute"" moments between Dean Jones and Connie Stevens.  With the exception of a brief eerie scene(lifted from the far superior ""The Haunting""), there is ZERO scary here.  It's as if the cast of ""That Darn Cat"" decided to try a horror movie.  Ugh.  What a dreary, overpriced, dull piece of junk.  Don't waste your time or money.",1297814400,7,461,4.560975609756097
4193066,4,B003TYI092,"The last time I saw this movie was 40+ years ago, and the intervening years have been quite kind to this little gem!  I had forgotten all about 'Two On A Guillotine,' even after watching it countless times on local 'Creature Features' shows and Saturday afternoon television runs in the 60s as a little kid.  I was thrilled to see that Warner Archives has resurrected this film, an 'old dark house' tale that still retains its power to conjure up a jolly good time, as well as a few scares!

Connie Stevens is surprisingly effective in her dual role as the wife and daughter of a famous magician who has passed away, promising to return from the afterlife.  Gorgeous, perky and, as others have noted, a GREAT screamer!!!  Cesar Romero proves yet again that he could chew scenery with the best of them, and though his screen time is minimal, his presence is felt throughout the film.  Dean Jones, the penultimate guy-next-door, provides not only the love interest, but also a grounding in reality that helps keep Connie in check as she slides slowly into hysteria.
Though it takes awhile to get going (quite awhile, actually, thus the 4-star rating), once it kicks into gear this becomes quite a little roller coaster ride.  Excellent black-and-white cinematography, an amazing, grandiose final score from the legendary Max Steiner, and even some directorial flourishes that still seem fresh and original today.  Genuine suspense toward the last third of the film, which climaxes with a satisfying return to the guillotine first glimpsed in the preamble to the film.

The print is in amazing condition--I believe this truly is a ""remastered edition"" as the packaging notes, in full anamorphic widescreen glory here and just gorgeous to look at.  I am SO impressed, and couldn't care less if this is a DVD-R...I'm thrilled to have this underrated, ""lost"" film in my permanent library!  BRAVO, Warners!

My dogs and I watched this last night, by ourselves, with the lights down and the popcorn bowl within easy reach.  SO much fun, I highly recommend this to anyone, especially us children of the 60s who LIVED for this kind of movie when we were little (you know who you are)!  In its own unassuming way, it's a bit of a classic--you won't be disappointed with the film itself or with this beautiful print.
Enjoy, enjoy, ENJOY!",1296777600,4,2325,4.82367758186398
