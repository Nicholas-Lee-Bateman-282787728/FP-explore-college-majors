8362431,3,6304158971,"Mermaid flesh imparts immortality when eaten, but it has a terrible secret. Of those who eat the creature's flesh, most - the lucky ones - die. The rest have to live as hideous monsters forever!!
From the very beginning, ""Mermaid Forest"" is underwhelming. It's only rescued by its shortness (just under an hour) and its intriguing ending. Otherwise, it is dull and predictable, the ennui only occasionally interrupted by splattering blood.
It's 1936. Towa, a young Japanese woman, lies desperately ill in a snowbound cottage. Her sister, Sawa, offers her a cup of what she identifies as mermaid blood - it's not flesh, but it should help some. Towa sips the hideous liquid, and her dog licks up a drop. Suddently, the animal convulses and dies. In the night, a fate more horrible strikes Towa herself.
Fast forward fifty-five years, when Towa captures an immortal girl, and finally her plan to rid herself of her curse can succeed.
The artwork is nothing particularly impressive, and I barely even noticed the sound. Frankly, this is just Highlander with some monsters thrown in for good measure.",981158400,3,1096,4.961956521739131
