8707165,4,B00UKC9ON2,"This is an entertaining French movie featuring a young Virginie Ledoyen (A Single Girl, The Beach) as a rising pop star with a secret--her best friend is the real talent behind the act, while she provides a pretty face and sex appeal. Eventually Ledoyen's character lets all the fame and adulation go to her head.  Will she remember what's truly important before it's too late?  It's all a bit mawkish and predictable, but the songs are great, and this is a must for fans of Virginie Ledoyen. The Blu-ray transfer looks very solid, and since the disc is region free and includes English subtitles, this is a good option for American fans.  It's doubtful this movie will receive a physical release in the U.S.  One nitpick:  The subtitles are within the black bar area, which could be an issue for people with certain projector setups.",1477872000,,834,4.724137931034483
