7013485,4,B00TONMBRE,"The two workouts that I was able to access were great, however the DVD was not properly inserted into its packaging.  When I received the DVD in the mail the disc was unattached and sliding all over the package, as a result the disk was scratched and the Hard Core workout was completely unusable because of the damage that had been done to the disc.  Overall Cassie's workouts will make you sore and get you results!  I am very disappointed that the product I received was damaged though.",1436832000,3,489,4.534090909090909
7013486,5,B00TONMBRE,Great workout  You will feel sore almost immedately after working out.,1429056000,5,70,5.363636363636363
7013487,5,B00TONMBRE,Will surely shrink my boy figure with Cassey helping me! What a great trainer. Love that its on a beach. So glad I got this DVD!,1428451200,2,128,3.9615384615384617
7013488,4,B00TONMBRE,"For the price, this is a good little DVD workout. But painful! It's definitely a challenge, and I have pretty decent ab/core muscles. No six pack, but I can do most most ab work with relative ease, but this one had me challenged. Cassey makes it fun though. I did feel like the ""Muffin Top Melter"" workout was more of a glutes workout than abs though. But I keep doing it anyway.

This would be too painful for me to do all the workouts at once so I just tack one or two on to my workout after doing cardio to get some extra ab work in.

It's a very pleasant beach environment and Cassey is personable, approachable and fun to work out with.",1483920000,,641,4.161290322580645
7013489,5,B00TONMBRE,"I'm going to second what everyone else says and give this video 5 stars. I'm an avid pilates junkie and Casey has some effective, creative,Ives on here. Three sections broken down into 7-8 minutes a piece, targeting different areas. I usually do two at a time.
Casey also gets straight to business which I like and isn't super annoying like some workout DVD instructors are. I like her style, and will research more of her fitness DVDs. This DVD is a great price too. I'm going to start incorporating into my daily routine, will update with results.",1483574400,,549,4.670103092783505
7013490,5,B00TONMBRE,"GREAT AB WORKOUT, HAVE TO MODIFY SOME MOVES THOUGH",1483488000,,50,4.666666666666667
7013491,5,B00TONMBRE,"I've followed Cassey on YouTube for years now and LOVE her contagious smile and positive attitude. Sometimes she's a little over the top, but her workouts are super effective and work exactly where they claim too.
This DVD kicks my butt everytime, but I've seen some good results with her workouts. My plank time has increased, my waist is slimmer (no abs yet), and even my posture has improved with these pilates workouts!",1481760000,2,423,4.808219178082192
7013492,5,B00TONMBRE,awesome exercise video!,1481241600,,23,7.0
7013493,5,B00TONMBRE,"This is my favorite abdominal workout.  After three weeks of practice, doing this workout three times a week,  I am seeing significant results.  Cassey is motivating and the workout is fun.",1480550400,,189,5.032258064516129
7013494,3,B00TONMBRE,short and sweet but she doesn't give a whole lot of instructions and its just a girl laying on a beach in the sand telling you to do exercises no different from any other Pilates DVD,1480550400,,182,4.083333333333333
7013495,5,B00TONMBRE,"This is my first Cassey Ho DVD.  I have been searching for a core specific workout to work into my rotation because I have gotten a little bored.  Although I haven't done Pilates in years I am very familiar with it, so I thought I would give this a try.  First, this is definitely NOT for beginners.  I do heavy lifting with a trainer 3 days a week, and 3 days a week of Jillian Michael's DVDs at home, so I would like to think I am in pretty good shape!  I decided to tackle this DVD head on and do all 3 workouts in a row last night.  Super fun, challenging, and literally had me shaking by the end.  There were a couple of times I had to stop for a few seconds but I pushed through.  I feel my obliques the most today, although my entire core has that nice ""I worked hard"" feeling.  I loved all of the moves, and don't let the title fool you - you do get some serious butt burners and shoulders/tris in this too!  This is most definitely being worked into my rotation and I am going to try her total body workout this weekend.",1478736000,5,1029,4.024630541871921
7013496,5,B00TONMBRE,"Love this video! It packs a lot of challenging moves targeting the entire core into 30 minutes. I'm a busy working mom, so I appreciate that. A lot of the exercises are conducive to modification and progression, too, which is great. I definitely recommend this video!",1477612800,,267,4.826086956521739
7013497,5,B00TONMBRE,"Okay, first of all, I'm really overweight, so I got this DVD to get myself back into shape. Oh my God, talk about feeling the burn.
It's a thirty minute complete video with three ten minute sections. Each section is intense. So far I haven't finished the full DVD. Granted I've also only just started using it, but it really is intense, and some of the moves I can't do. Yet. I'm determined to finish it all, even if it kills me, which granted feels like a likely possibility.
Cassey Ho, is very bubbly, something that would normally grate on my last nerve, yet I find her cheerfulness helps keep me going, pushing me to finish the sections, even as my body is crying for me to stop.
I recommend this DVD so much that I've ordered two extra copies as gifts for my family.",1475971200,4,771,4.324137931034483
7013498,5,B00TONMBRE,"Holy abs! I really love this DVD, but it's a serious workout. My poor stomach and sides were burning like crazy but I loved every minute of it. The fun and funny part is that Cassey really has her timing down pat on the DVD. Literally every time I was about to throw in the towel she would say something like ""Don't quit now!"" or ""Don't let those feet drop.' It made me laugh and made it a fun workout. :) I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants awesome abs.",1473724800,4,469,4.108695652173913
7013499,4,B00TONMBRE,"The cover is sooooo photoshopped! If you look at her videos, she isn't that freakishly skinny in the middle",1470355200,,107,4.684210526315789

7013503,4,B00TONMBRE,"It's alright, not really for beginners. She had some hard moves I suggest starting with something else and when your a little more advance come back to this one.",1462060800,,161,4.586206896551724
7013504,5,B00TONMBRE,"This is a great dvd, Cassey keeps you motivated and makes you want to push yourself to keep going. If you are a beginner she tells ypu how to modify the exercises, but I would defintely say that this is for someone who works out reguarlly. You defintely feel every exercise from start to finish and you are outta breath and sore- in a good way!- by the time you finish.

Cassey talks to you throughout each exercise, making you feel like she is there with you in person. She keeps it lighthearted and makes you want to exercise everyday. After watching her on youtube, I bought her book and both of her dvds and I am happy with my purchase.",1458259200,2,640,4.289256198347108
7013505,3,B00TONMBRE,"I am a huge Cassey Ho fan, but this dvd isn't worth the money",1457913600,2,61,3.4285714285714284

7013508,5,B00TONMBRE,Great workout!  I was a bit skeptical but she is no joke!  Even if I only do one or two of the ~10 minute workouts I can feel the difference.  Winsor pilates has nothing on this workout!  Definitely recommend for the intermediate/advanced pilates lover:),1454544000,5,254,4.704545454545454

7013512,5,B00TONMBRE,"LOVE this workout! First video offers some fun, new moves I have never seen or done from Cassey's youtube channel. I would, however, recommend checking out Tiffany Rothe's video entillted, "" Steps on How To Work Out in 10 min Booty Shaking Waist & Shaking Your Hips!"" The candlestick method is not a very effective move for me. You should be able to find this on youtube. It really works!",1443571200,2,388,4.557142857142857

8702389,5,B00TONMBRE,I love Cassey's videos on youtube but hard to exercise to them when the computer is a different room. This video will make my life easier.

8702391,3,B00TONMBRE,Cassey Ho incprporates two many other muscle groups to make it a true ab workout. I don't care for her high pitched voice either,1514505600,,128,4.375
