8147390,3,B000IU35O0,"I had heard much about David Foster Wallace including the claim that he has written the great post- Borgesian novel. I expected to see and hear an enormously literate and reflective soul. I am not sure that I got it right but the feeling I had was of something different. A bright boy, the son of college professors who in the interview says in his wisdom that teaching can only be done in an enthusiastic way for five years- a trendy person looking to know and analyze a certain film and film- director as if the key to the universe was in this. A bookman perhaps but more a culture- man looking to find the line towards the latest most thrilling thing.
Off- the- wall - wild connections , a Rambo- like -Rimbaud.
