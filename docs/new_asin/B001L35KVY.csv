8317049,5,B001L35KVY,"A young man becomes possessed by THE ABOMINATION, unleashing unholy vengeance on the unsuspecting! His hyper-religious mum is the most memorable, blood-drenched victim of THE ABOMINATION!  Her preacher's death is equally marvelous, though too short. In spite of it's being mega-cheeeze-tastic, the ultra-low-budget, practical FX are nonetheless glorious! The monsters are (somewhat) reminiscent of the alien creatures in THE DEADLY SPAWN- Big, rubber mouths full of sharp teeth. Gorehundts will shout for joy! Blood spurts just about everywhere! The chainsaw / oozing brain scene alone should be enough to bring the love! THE ABOMINATION also sports a grim, cruel atmosphere of ultimate doom. The non-camera work, scatter-brained editing, and convulsive ""plot"", all help in achieving this miracle. This one is absolutely insane!... P.S.- As an added ""bonus"", all of the goriest, gooshiest bits are shown in a seemingly endless montage at the beginning of the film! Yep, the film's creators spoil their own movie for no good reason!...",1405209600,,1034,5.544303797468355

""An old woman coughs up what she believes to be a tumor. While asleep, the thing crawls inside of her son and reproduces inside him, then causes him to go on a killing spree to feed it."" [--IMDB]

As a fanatic of utterly ridiculous, gore-slathered horror movies, you can imagine my delight when I read this description [the quote above].

Like a Troma movie, Cody and his friends enjoy drinking and driving while racing on the wrong side of the road and drinking at work.  Shortly after being parasitized by his mother's coughed up tumor, he coughs up one of his own and keeps it under his bed like a pet.

""The abomination""--the Biblical demon of Revelations harbingered by Saint John--somehow compels Cody (Scott Davis; Ozone! Attack of the Redneck Mutants, Witchcraft III)  to kill people to feed it.  Considering the obvious budgetary limitations of this movie, an effort was made to show Cody slitting the throats of his victems.  Excessive quantities of fake blood more than make up for the poor execution of...well, everything else in the movie.  Cody ends up killing basically everyone he knows.

After the first ""feeding"" the baby abomination grows rapidly. It's awesomely gross and reminds me of the dog cage scene in The Thing (1981).  For the simplicity of the materials used, the creature looks pretty cool!  Before we know it Cody his choking up more abominations which colonize the kitchen cabinets and the laundry machine. They look like giant fleshy muppet mouths with tentacles.

This movie has lousy film quality, terrible editing, one-take cue-card reading in lieu of acting, and I think many of the scenes were dubbed.  However, the serious attempts at soulful scoring during Cody's narrations giggle me into forgiving these flaws.  I also loved the uber-hammed up (and long) scene when Cody watches his mother get eaten by them and when bloody cottage cheese is used as brains.

The end is a drawn out finale of blood and entrails.  If that does it for you, then you should see this ASAP.",1358899200,,2150,4.9222222222222225

It's either that or a bootleg copy of this flick; I wouldn't pay high prices for a vhs copy unless I was into collecting horror on vhs like some horror buffs do.  'The Abomination' is about a young man living with his highly religious mom, who by the way coughs up a nasty parasite, thinks her son desperately needs saving from the devil haha.  This parasite loves to eat!!!  That's all I'm gonna say about this flick!  Just know that this is loaded with gore and that the ending is unexpected!!!  If you enjoyed how the creature looked in 'The Deadly Spawn', than you will enjoy this!!!  Oh, and one more thing, after I saw this horror flick, I had to go out and buy a pear of Ray Bans and grow a mullet haha!",1259798400,4,769,4.232876712328767
