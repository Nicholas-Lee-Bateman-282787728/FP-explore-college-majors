1662469,2,B00005TPOO,"This nearly 10-year-old video has now gained new life and popularity as a result of 9/11. Originally produced in the aftermath of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing by journalist Steve Emerson, it does deserve some credit for maintaining that Islamist terrorists would again try to strike on American soil (although there was no shortage of such warnings before 9/11, only of people who were willing to listen to them), hence my two stars. But many viewers seem to miss the fact that in this film Emerson was 99% wrong in his diagnosis of the supposed Islamic threat against America. Only a small portion of the film deals with the WTC attack. The majority of it deals with pro-Palestinian groups which are active in the U.S. - Hamas, Islamic Jihad, etc. Without ever explicitly stating it, Emerson proceeds from the assumption that anti-Israel equals anti-American. Through a very subtle sleight-of-hand by seamlessly presenting videos of the WTC attack alongside pro-Palestinian rallies in America, Emerson convinces viewers that America faces one broad, united, terrorist front - Al Qaeda, Hamas, etc. are all out to destroy America together. Anyone who has paid any attention at all to events in the Middle East knows that this is nonsense. There can be no doubt that there is hostility toward America among Palestinian groups, given America's uncompromising support for Israel in the face of blatant injustices perpetrated by the Israeli government. But the fact is that there has not been a single act of terrorism on American soil that is attributable to Palestinian resistance groups. The ideology and goals of Al Qaeda are vastly different from that of the Palestinian groups, and there is nothing to indicate that any of them act in concert with Osama bin Laden. Their interest lies in the rights of Palestinians, not global jihad. Once one realizes that, this video reveals itself as little more than a subtle propaganda ploy which blurs the real issues. Until Americans realize that it is America's blatantly one-sided support for Israel, as well as its support for many other anti-Islamic governments around the world, that has resulted in the current situation, and not the beliefs and desires of Muslims around the world, there is little hope of resolving the crisis in any meaningful way. This video only perpetuates the problem, and offers no solutions.",1064880000,7,2371,5.082051282051282
1662470,5,B00005TPOO,"...to the so-called ""moderate muslims"", who have yet to muster enough courage to take responsibility for this theological gang-bang they call a religion.
Now lest they be concerned about the negative reviews below, informed readers would serve themselves ably in taking careful measure of what these reviews really are.
Note, for instance, that they offer absolutely nothing in terms of specific criticism of its content.  Rather, they reflect the same drearily predictable defensiveness from the nice, civilized islamists, who are probably just beginning to realize that they've been tricked.  Look, kiddies, don't kill the messenger, OK?
And, of course, for added entertainment at this very special olympics of literary criticism, you can also count on the vapid pubescent drones who so gleefully cry ""islamaphobe"", or stupidly compare the irritating habits of fundamentalist christians to the modern global Cult of Thugee that is Islam-- after all, isn't calling a teenage girl nasty names outside a clinic the same as killing thousands of defenseless people?  Whoa, I'll have to get back to you on that, dude.  I'll IM ya!
I do have to admit, however, that the frighteningly obsessive and pathological attack on Steve Emerson by the mongoloid from Va. does represent something unique -- even if that uniqueness is the aquisition of some no-so latent love-fear obsession.  I expect that whatever wrote that will soon be an imam.
Regardless, Emerson's video in just one more unsettling echo of the question asked every day, by millions, in silence:
""where are the moderate muslims fighting to regain control of their religion?""
My guess is that they're holed up in a safe house somewhere with Nicole Simpson's real killer.",1057622400,26,1724,5.254545454545455
1662471,4,B00005TPOO,"This is the notorious 1994 episode of Frontline about violent Islamic militants in America, bracketed by post-9/11 footage of that disaster and the U.S. attack in Afghanistan.  Hidden cameras inside *American* mosques reveal Islamic militants raising funds for Hamas, baying for the blood of Jews.  Even something so innocent as a summer camp for boys is turned into terror training by these apostles of jihad.  (Catch the little arab boy hissing ""Butcher the Jews!"" during that segment.) Evidence is also offered suggesting that the first World Trade Center bombing was plotted and funded inside the U.S.  At the end, the narrator assures us that Islam itself does not condone the violent jihad that American Muslims are being called to.  This is baldly untrue, based on the Koran and the Hadiths and a quarter century of painful experience, but that issue needs its own video, so it doesn't much matter here.
It's hard to believe that PBS once actually aired this mortal sin against multi-cultism.  Complaints against its creator, Steve Emerson, from well-funded American Muslim groups helped get him blacklisted from NPR's All Things Considered for a while.  Less subtle disapproval from less savory Muslims nearly landed him in the FBI's witness protection program.  In response to the (non-existent) oppression of Muslims in America, PBS this past year aired its infamous pro-Islam infomercial, in which American Muslims are portrayed as no different from anyone else save for headgear and cuisine.  It ain't so, and this film shows why.  As Paul Harvey says, it is _not_ one world.",1044748800,66,1587,5.1640625
1662472,5,B00005TPOO,"After viewing this crucial documentary, I was astonished at just how unsafe the American public truly is in relation to those terrorist groups who would like to see the downfall of the West at any, and all costs.
""Terrorists Among Us"" shows in plain detail the network of Islamic terrorist who have set up base in the United States with the intention of killing and maiming American citizens. On this video you hear their leaders, and the fiery declarations of war against the West, as well as many conferences which have taken place between Islamic militant groups, and their leaders (How is this allowed to happen?).
this documentary should be recommended viewing for anyone who feels that Bush's supposed ""War On Terrorism"" has somehow made the country a safer place.",1021334400,38,770,4.930769230769231

1662474,5,B00005TPOO,"When are we going to stop being politically correct and call this war exactly what it is...an Islamist attack and effort to destroy Western Culture. Until Muslim clerics operating in this country (enjoying the freedoms to they always decry) roundly and loudly condemn Islamic Jihad, Hamas, Hezbollah and Al Qeada, and the governments that support them, the Saudis, the Iranians, the Iraqis, the Syrians, the Lybians, and acknowledge Israel's right to exist, the United States should not worry or care about ruffling Arab feelings.

1662475,5,B00005TPOO,"After viewing this film I realized the harsh reality that America  has been under attack for a long time. None of us chose to belive that it could ever happen to us.
America is in a state of denial believing that no more attacks will take place, it is not a matter of if more attacks will take place it is a matter of when.
This film has been my alarm clock, it woke me up to the reality we all must face and eventually conquer. America let us all work together and do everything we can as a nation to battle terrorism and restore peace to our country.
Much thanks to the producer of this film Steven Emerson.",1008806400,23,609,4.117647058823529

It is an eye-opener and a MUST SEE for those who would like to see just how serious are those people who would destroy our freedoms, and send us (Americans) back into the 'dark ages'.

Steve Emerson presents organizations operating legally in American led by fanatics exhorting their members to kill Americans and Jews. Before the WTC tragedy, it was a wake up call which it seems was ignored by the very people who may have been able to protect us as well as almost everyone else.  I leant it to several friends and it wasn't until the WTC incident that they took the tape seriously.  One person didn't bother to look at it until the incident.  Americans have been asleep and Steve Emerson has been fighting a lonely fight to wake us up.  Will it be too late?  We can only hope that it is not.

1662490,5,B00005TPOO,"This is a must companion. Out of date certainly, but, it just shows, in 1994, we knew what was going to happen and Bill Clinton ignored it. Monica was more important, and all the other girls. Hillary must share the guilt of wanting her own ambitions more than taking care of her own home, so the president could take care of America. We knew then what was going to happen, just did not know when it would happen.

1662492,4,B00005TPOO,"Steven Emerson's ""Terrorists Among Us - Jihad In America"" is a great documentary, filmed in the last decade of the 20th century.  Emerson dedicated all of his time to investigation of terrorist Islamic groups that operated freely in the U.S.  Facts that Emereson uncovered are chilling and disturbing, and should have been an immediate and urgent warning bell for everyone in our country.

Emerson supports all his claims with video evidence - evidence that is hard to dispute.  He had such excellent foresight, that it is criminal that he wasn't taken seriously, but was instead discredited by Dan Rather due to a misunderstanding over the Oklahoma City bombing.  Emerson's documentary is clear and to the point.  There were no instances in which I was confused or wondered if something was cut so it could be presented in a light that would suit Emerson's agenda.  Throughout the documentary it is clear that the only agenda Emerson had was the safety of the United States.

The only reason that I didn't give this documentary five stars is because there was no update in the end.  The film stands as it is, almost as a ""I told you so!"" statement.  I believe that the movie would have a much bigger impact if Emerson emerged in the end (and above it all) with an updated information on the organizations and people he researched in the 1990s.  Even without that, I highly recommend this documentary to everyone who has America's safety on their minds.",1177286400,44,1453,4.795180722891566
1662493,1,B00005TPOO,"""The Terrorists are among us"" he is right and Steve Emerson is one of them because he is lying to create terror from peaceful American Muslims.  Many people already know that Israel and the US government are doing most of the terror and the killing around the world (hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians). Sept 11 was not the work of 19 Muslim guys, since several of them are still alive and this has been confirmed. Do your research and you should find the truth, the overwhelming evidence is on the internet. Don't depend on the US News media and the bigots, or so called experts like Steve Emerson for all your information, or you'll be in the dark and you would misinformed.",1165795200,3,685,4.569105691056911

1662496,5,B00005TPOO,"For the past four years, since 9/11, I've been on a personal quest to figure out why the terrorists thought it in their best interest to murder almost 3,000 Americans. I've read perhaps 30 books on the Middle East, Terrorism, Islam, the clash of civilizations and related topics. I am far and away the best informed person on Islam and terrorism I personally know. I have a definite opinion on the subject, but almost no one wants to hear about any of it, neither the subject nor my opinion. It's either so alarming they don't want to hear about it, or such old news they're not interested.

I even bought copies of some of the better books and passed them out to my friends to read so we could discuss them. Of the 15 books I passed out, one person read one of the books.

The typical attitude is it didn't happen to me. It didn't happen in the past day. It didn't happen here. I'm bored with the subject. Let's talk about the latest Oprah Winfrey show.

But this video is only an hour long. Perhaps my friends and acquaintences will have an attention span long enough to watch the video. It's alarming. It's simplistic. It doesn't really get into the crux of the problem. But it is short and easily understood.

The problem: For the past 1,400 years there has been a clash between Islam and the West that has been recently exacerbated by the shrinking of our world. Moslems claim Islam is the true religion, but the Islamic world is thrid rate. The GDP of all  Islamic countries, including their oil revenue, is less than half that of Italy. (Half a trillion dollars for the Moslems, 1.2 trillion for Italy. 12 trillion for the U.S.)Moslem poverty fuels Moslem rage. But Moslem poverty is not the fault of the West. Their poverty is the result of the laws, restrictions and customs of their society, and those laws, customs and restrictions basicaly come from the Qur'an. To solve their problem they've got to reintrepret their religion. But they don't want to. They'd rather lash out in anger.

This video won't tell you the details of the problem, but it will tell you there is a problem, and it's getting worse.

Best single book to read on the subject: ""Unveiling Islam"", by Ergun and Emir Caner. They articulate the problem and offer a solution.",1123200000,26,2252,4.5594059405940595

Ironically, what he found in his investigation during the early 1990s is still true today.  Ignore the anti-Emerson reviews and watch the tape.  Are all Moslems involved in terrorism?  No.  Do we have a problem with terrorist Moslems in the United States hiding behind the American right of freedom of religion?  Definitely.  The attacks on Emerson from the Moslem PR machine is typical and expected.  Those of us ""in the business"" know Emerson is correct and also know there is a serious problem within the American Moslem community.

Prior to viewing this film, I had regarded Steve Emerson as a person and an author who knew what he was talking about, and was worthy of my trust and my highest esteem.
