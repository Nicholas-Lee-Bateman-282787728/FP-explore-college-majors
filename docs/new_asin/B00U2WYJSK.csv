7027929,3,B00U2WYJSK,"Ever since the term grindhouse was pasted into the lexicon of movie genres with the release of the movie by the same name in 2007 there have been a ton of homage movies released. The term was a way of describing movies that came out that were low budget with violent themes, involved martial arts, horror, drugs, pimps and more while having a grainy look to them due to their screening non-stop for years in low rent movie houses based on the old 42nd Street location of New York. Those theaters were homes for junkies who wanted a place to crash after a fix or johns looking to find hookers willing to take care of them in the semi-private darkness of a theater. But 42nd Street got cleaned up, small independent producers stopped making those sorts of films and things changed. Until 2007.

Following the release of GRINDHOUSE, you started to see movies that actually played back in the day find their way to DVD. Some went as far as blu-ray. Along the way the tributes started to get made by young directors who thought they could make a name for themselves attempting to recreate what they saw being released. Some were good, most were bad and many are forgotten. Occasionally one makes its way back into release as is the case with this movie, made in 2009.

The movie harkens back to that combination of samurai film and western while at the same time bringing it into the present. Just where is anyones clue as there seems to be no location you can connect this with nor the need of the film maker to tell us. It just happens folks, deal with it. A blind man with a samurai sword is taken to the middle of a desert and dropped off. The driver is about to kill the man who defends himself and kills him, finding out why he was brought here before he expires. He then sets out to find the man he came to seek revenge on.

Along the way he encounters a fellow sword holder who helps him in his journey. Along the way he reveals that the man he is intent on killing, Nathan Flesher, a scumbag villain who killed the mans wife and child before blinding him, is to be released from prison that day at a particular time. His journey is to be there when he gets released to kill him for what he did.

But that won't be as easy as it seems. The Flesher has hired seven deadly assassins to prevent the blind samurai from reaching him. Along their journey the blind man and his companion face off against each of these killers with the hope of getting to Flesher at the end of their journey. So theres the story. Does the movie do a good job of telling it along the way?

Well yes and no. At first glance the movie is one of those terrible films that at face value leaves you scratching your head and wondering why anyone would want to see a special release of the film let alone pay the extra fees associated with owning it on blu-ray. It isn't until you look beneath the surface to realize that there are fans of the film who will love owning it this way and look forward to its release.

The martial arts action here is some of the worst ever put to celluloid.or digital storage. The motions are slow and choreographed for actors who move that way as to avoid killing or damaging one another. Then again that was just how many of the action sequences in tons of old classic martial arts movies were. We tend to forget that the fast paced martial arts sequences weve come to enjoy are more recent and done as much with special effects as well as athletically prone stunt men. Once you realize this they scenes offer more laughs than thrills and more memories than stunned appreciation of the skills involved.

The acting is wooden at best but then again, reference what this film is paying homage to. If you think those films contained Oscar winning performances think again.

The movie does include the things that made a grindhouse movie a grindhouse movie though. There are plenty of exposed breasts here, some used as weapons. Ive reached the age where these do little to draw my interest and feel pity for actresses who either feel the need to do this or have no options but to do so if they want employed. If I were 20 years old I might think differently. It has the scratchy look to the film stock being used. It has the sudden jump in image associated with poor film splices. Sprocket holes pop up along the side of the screen now and then. Do these things make this a good grindhouse film? Maybe not but they do make for a fun time for those who love the genre.",1433894400,,4468,4.355342136854742

7027932,3,B00U2WYJSK,"""Samurai Avenger"" is an obscure, cult-minded, modern take on the samurai genre with a lot of weirdness and gore to its name. It's the kind of movie that can be described by referencing any number of other films (the credits even list the filmmakers it's officially paying homage to), and personally, I see it as a combination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-String-Samurai/dp/6305297223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six-String Samurai</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;with a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>&nbsp;thrown in. It's more of an adventure film than an outright action flick, and definitely won't appeal to everyone, but despite a few moments of excess, I had an overall good time with it.

The story: seeking to avenge the murder of his family by a rich sadist (Domiziano Arcangeli,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flesh-Mannequins/dp/B006IRQUF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flesh Mannequins</a>), a blinded samurai (director Kurando Mitsutake,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-On-Rice/dp/B003VE9WME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White On Rice</a>) teams with a mysterious and lethal drifter (Jeffrey Lippold, ""Seducing Cindy"") to cut through a line of assassins to get to his bloody goal.

The movie's action content is surprisingly restrained. There's good amount of swordplay and a bit of shooting, but the intent here was surely to present a largely realistic rendition of kendo. This means that the swordfights are brief, methodical, and for the most part not very flashy. Their quality still manages to fluctuate: at times they're poorly shot, and at other times the choreography is kind of slow, but overall I walked away with a good impression. The performers certainly come across as convincing, demonstrating kenjutsu and iaido techniques with general confidence. Kurando Mitsutake's form looks good, and even Jeffrey Lippold - a newcomer to action who's already somehow at the center of a controversy regarding his real-life credentials - gives a strong showing. The fighting certainly doesn't try to slow down or overshadow the story, and in this endeavor it's successful...but the lack of a genuine back & forth swordfight still makes the movie feel like it's missing something.

Some things it's not missing, though, are blood and guts. The film is liberal in its depiction of violence: in the long run, it doesn't set any new records, but there are plenty of severed limbs, sliced-open necks, spilled entrails, and even a scene wherein Lippold slices open an opponent's pregnant belly to spill out the unborn baby (ironically, this is to save the baby's life: it actually lives through the film). Particularly this last scene was a bit much for me, and people more squeamish than me will certainly be alienated. However, a universally better thing the film has going for it is its writing: I like how almost all of the noteworthy characters are given their own dramatic backstory, as well as the writing's penchant for Clint Eastwood-esque dialogue. The editing technique of stylistically aging the flick (complete with inserts of ""restored"" footage) works better here than in many features that have tried it before and since. The movie is fun to watch (most of the time) and the story's definitely fun to follow - these are the feature's strong points.

(SPOILER) The after-credits scene promises a sequel; it's been three years since this one was released, but I'd still like to see that one made - I hope the money I spent to rent this went towards some sort of production fund. In the meantime, I'd recommend this one to both samurai and grindhouse aficionados, but not to anyone overly concerned with taste. ""Samurai Avenger"" will take some effort to love, but this one's perfectly capable of filling somebody's personal niche.",1353283200,3,4158,6.066326530612245
7027933,5,B00U2WYJSK,This film was a surprise hit and audience favorite at San Jose's Cinequest International Film Festival! It's was just as entertaining watching it at home with family and friends! A sure audience pleaser!,1297209600,3,203,5.181818181818182
7027934,1,B00U2WYJSK,"The trailer made this look like a lot of fun, and given the content, it should have been. But it wasn't. In fact, it was downright dreary. The film's pacing was terrible, with it constantly stopping and starting for flashbacks right in the middle of action sequences. This went on ad infinitum. Then there's the unexciting and badly shot fight scenes, the pointless pausing for unnecessary narration, the wooden performances by the leads, etc, etc. Each to their own, of course, but for me it was deathly dull.",1279497600,5,510,4.806818181818182
7027935,5,B00U2WYJSK,"Director Kurando Mitsutake dropped Spaghetti and Sushi into a blender, hit the liquefy button and poured out a spoof film of perfect consistency ... `Samurai Avenger: Blind Wolf.'

This is not a film for the faint of heart or should I say, not for the queasy of stomach. Those who like blood and guts won't be disappointed. Maybe some Intel 3-D next time?

The storyline did its job, which was to support the action scenes. The narrative gave intervals of relief from the gore with a laugh or with weapon (sword) education etc.

I asked Jeffrey James Lippold (Drifter/Lead) if the film's take on swordplay and the soul of the samurai was based on fact. He said that some may have come from myth and folklore, but that some might have been performed at one time.

I thank the Cinequest Film Festival for the opportunity to be among the first to view `Samurai Avenger: Blind Wolf.' A film destined to attract a huge world following.",1277856000,5,930,4.618181818181818

7027939,3,B00U2WYJSK,"Blu Ray Review: Synapse Version. This Blu Ray comes with an audio commentary, a ""making of"", bloopers, and other s#!+. The picture quality is intentionally crappy so it's good, and the audio is neat.

Movie Review: The movie is about some blind douche on a quest to kill 7 assassins and some guy for killing his wife and kid. I am in utter ambivalence with this one. The good things about this movie is bad acting, the Grindhouse feel, despite the sword play choreography being very old school like and we are talking 1950's samurai movie s#!+ it was still fun with all the dismemberment and blood gushy happiness and the characterization. The bad things about this movie are the STUPID FLASHBACK S#!+!!!!! Uh! They should of kept it to two flashback scenarios but nooOOOooo! We need 30 of them! F***s! Another relevance is when the action scenes are paused and this a$$#0|# does this meaningless narration on how these words or swords work or whatever. IT IS RETARDED!!!! And the pacing is slow. So the final result: I liked this movie well enough but the bad things sort of ruined what could of been a great tribute to Westerns and Samurai movies. And by the way, for those who cry about this one guy and not being a real army medic, I DON'T GIVE A F***!

Conclusion: 4 1/2 for the Blu Ray and 2 3/4 stars for Samurai Avenger: The Blind Wolf.",1442707200,4,1344,4.504098360655738

7027941,5,B00U2WYJSK,"This particular movie is just one very special mix of diverse genres, the choice itself for me it's making of it an instant cult movie: interesting to notice how much appreciation this flick has gotten all around the World ( i don't even know how many DVD or Blue Ray 's different versions exist, even with a slightly adjusted title : Samurai Avenger: The Lone Wolf), and often awarded, in very selective Film Festivals. But, strangely, American audiences have been very snobbish with it, and, while some of the same folks would praise some obscure, rubbish trash made in Europe back in the late 1960's or 1970's, just because Quentin or Eli Roth said so, or for mere exploitation's value, they call this  a boredom, badly acted, and directed, with poor fighting scenes, and so forth. Was amazed to read some of the other reviews! I am glad i bought the Blue Ray, had very low expectations, i was pleasantly surprised how terrific, and truly engaging this movie was for real, and if anything, truly resembling and paying homage to some of the greater film making of the old days, such as films as ""The Big Silence"" or ""My Name is Nobody"". I mean truly well produced movies, that like this one, are exceptionally photographed, include great action scenes, good location work, mystery, twists, gore, and professional acting: i liked especially Domiziano Arcangeli as the villain, psychopath Nathan Flesher: another great overlooked performance, pulled by the veteran actor with gusto, and leaving a certain ""Klaus Kinski's"" charismatic appeal. Many have even called him wooden: i think not. The lead was director Kurando Mitsutake, who's honestly greater as a director, with skilled professional visuals, and good storytelling, than he is as an actor. But, again, he manages to convey a good dose of mystery in his own characterization, that serves the plot just fine, while the other co-lead, Jeffrey James Lippold, whom i was not familiar with, delivers as the Drifter, thanks also to his handsome physicality which seems to be a key factor for the role. Supporting roles were all also well cast and believable, especially, i thought, the avenger's ill fated young wife, and the first killer in the truck, a very fine actor. There's a wild, never seen before, mix of witches, zombies, boobs, martial arts, Japanese art house's references, and retro Euro trash film making's galore that is somewhat puzzling at first, but that eventually, with the right dose of irony, succeeds to make of this flick, such an unique movie, enthralling and outstandingly visual, chilling with its own brutality, and final determination to kill, while amusing, when entertaining with the incredibly exotic mix of all the cult's main genres. Great idea, well made and professionally produced and presented, what else? I did enjoy and appreciated a lot of it, including some truly amazing ""old school"" and so real looking, bloody violent special effects, another true winning point in what i found to be a true movie to talk about, and deserving of the reputation of a cult film. And, for me, it truly delivered the goods. So i am actually perhaps overly praising it a bit, in purpose, since i find insulting such malevolent attitude toward inspired professional work as opposed to 'so called cult material', coming from the past, stuff that often is pathetically out dated and ridiculously bad to result embarrassing to behold. And don't get me wrong, i dig, of course, genre Movies,and i am myself a big fan, but again, strictly only of those strikingly made with top honors. Perhaps, 'The Blind Wolf' has its flaws, and some restrictions, but, especially when compared to most re-released dreary stuff, this is something, again, truly original, and very well executed and put together, that never fails to entertain the lovers of the genres it plays, or even mocks.",1441584000,3,3846,4.972049689440993
