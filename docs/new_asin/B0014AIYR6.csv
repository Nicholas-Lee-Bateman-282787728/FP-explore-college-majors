8254811,5,B0014AIYR6,"This is an excellent documentary on what is probably the most important spiritual event in modern times--A Course in Miracles.  If Jesus would have written the Bible, the product would have been the document that is called ""A Course in Miracles"".  Written in modern English, it leaves very little to doubt what the original intent of this man commonly referred to as Jesus.  The film does a masterful job of showing who were the keys players in the improbable events that led to its publication.  A Course in Miracles is a masterpiece on so many different levels--spirituality, pyschology, modern educational method, much of which is presented in the style of Shakespearean iambic pentameter.  It is a self-study course--powerfully directed at the individual.  Clearly stating that is not the only pathway to your higher self, it is this reviewers opinion that its methods are geared to a modern-day society and by far shortens the journey to one's higher self.  It is the quintessence of spiritual statment and thought.  There is really nothing else out there that even comes close.  Well worth the effort and time it takes to achieve its mastery.",1351555200,4,1148,5.0
