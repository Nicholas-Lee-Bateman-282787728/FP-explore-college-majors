3620515,5,B001GUL6BK,"I loved He-Man as a kid growing up in the 80's and this brings it back. Though a remake of the original series I do favor it overall as the original jumped around during there story telling. I can ignore this as I never noticed this as a kid, He-Man always defeated Skelator so the day was saved as far as I was concerned. This has not changed much though lol.

He still wins and knowing how each of the characters are connected to each other and became who they became is great as a adult though there is some discrepancies when comparing it with He-Mans twin sister Adora AKA She-Ra Princess of Power. This series is not She-Ra but I would of liked it to at least acknowledge her in the story line a bit as watching how Adora became She-Ra I was like ""Wait I thought the sorceress was the mother not the queen?!""

These are small and I don't put any major marks against it. It is a cartoon after all so it is to be expected a bit and if you don't watch She-Ra you will probably never notice as the story does follow its own well. I would recommend this series to anyone. For the price and enjoyment, By the powers of Greyskull, there is no reason to pass it up.",1261785600,3,1163,4.1415929203539825
3620516,5,B001GUL6BK,"This was truly a great deal. There is every episode from this series on this DVD. My son loves it. And, there is a powerful Goddess & some powerful females as well as the males. This is a great buy and a really fun show for kids.",1261785600,2,229,3.893617021276596
3620517,4,B001GUL6BK,I happen to be a huge He man fan as I grew up in the 80s and have seen every He Man incarnation cartoon show since then. This new He Man TV Series is well produced with great storylines and animation and although it's not as good as the original animated show from the 80s it still manages to be very enjoyable. Highly recommended for all He Man fans.,1260921600,7,351,4.101449275362318
3620518,3,B001GUL6BK,"The actual dvd set is fine, but there are packaging issues. The DVD's are packaged in paper slips/envelopes stacked on top of one another in a clam shell case. There is no paperwork or booklet. Definatley a bare bones release.

I actually think it is better than the originals...I know some will disagree, but you won't be disappointed.  The only thing that is missing is an episode list which is found on the DVD's themselves.  If you are reading this, just buy it.  You won't regret it.",1255219200,,403,4.223684210526316
3620521,5,B001GUL6BK,"There's no denying it: BCI Eclipse had some incredible animated titles that risked becoming forever lost to the archives of time once the company was forced to shut its doors this past year.  Fortunately Mill Creek Entertainment, which by the way is distributed by BCI's parent company, Navarre, has acquired the rights to bring many of BCI's titles to the home market once more.  Even more impressive still is that these sets will be packaged up and sold as complete box sets (rather than individual season releases).

In the case of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, this set represents the complete 2002-series release by Mike Young Corporation.  Coming in at a total runtime of 960 minutes, this set spans 4 discs and contains the same clear-plastic slipcase and artwork-style as the previous BCI releases.

The extras contained are only slightly less thorough than the individual season releases and include:
End of Episodes Morals
Interviews with Toyline Artists from Mattel and The Four Horsemen
12 audio commentaries
Scripts for episodes 1-40
A PDF Comic Book for unproduced episode #40

Notably missing from this set are the original art cards (a pair was included in each of the three season releases).

Now let's take a look at the show itself:

Fans are treated to what many consider the most accurate and exciting rendition of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe saga. Debuting in 2002 under the Mike Young Productions umbrella, this latest rendition of the He-Man source material closely follows the original Filmation standard set in the early 1980s with modernized animation quality and in-depth stories that further built upon the original characters and environments.  The first season consisted of the following 26 episodes:

The Beginning Part 1
The Beginning Part 2
The Beginning Part 3
The Courage of Adam
Sky War
The Deep End
Lessons
Siren's Song
The Ties That Bind
Dragon's Brood
Turnabout
Mekaneck's Lament
Night of the Shadowbeasts
Underworld
The Mystery of Anwat Gar
The Monster Within
Roboto's Gambit
Trust
Orko's Garden
Buzz-Off's Pride
Snake Pit
The Island
The Sweet Smell of Victory
Separation
The Council of Evil Part 1
The Council of Evil Part 2

Season two consisted of the following thirteen:

The Last Stand
To Walk With Dragons
Out of the Past
Rise of the Snake Men Part 1
Rise of the Snake Men Part 2
The Price of Deceit
Of Machines and Men
Second Skin
The Power of Grayskull
Web of Evil
Rattle of the Snake
History
Awaken the Serpent

In case you're just tuning in, no this isn't the Filmation version of the show so many of us recall with warm fuzzies from our youth. This is in fact the third (and most recent) animated iteration of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Produced for Cartoon Network by Mike Young
 Productions, this version ran from 2002 until 2004 where it went for two full seasons (26 in the first season, 13 in the second). Along the way it managed to snag a very well deserved Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing (2004).

While there are few who could argue successfully that anything could replace the original Filmation series, Mike Young Productions managed to capture all of the elements that made the original so successful and to bring them up to modern standards of animation quality, sound work, and script writing. As a result the mythos had been brought to an entirely new generation of fans while simultaneously pleasing fans of the original.

Without giving too much away (I hate spoilers personally), I will say that the origins of Snake Mountain will begin to unfold in the second-half of the first season in addition to the complete origin of the Dark Hemisphere which imprisons Skeletor and his minions. New characters are plentiful as well and contain some slick back-story efforts, which make even the original Mattel toys a lot more desirable. Among the notables includes the stories of Two-Bad, Cobra Kahn, Cyclone, Roboto, Moss Man, Zodak, and Stinkor. Many of these characters were never fully fleshed out in the original show (if they appeared at all) and would have remained only in the imaginations of those who played with the toys if not for the spectacular effort here. We are also treated to a couple of new looks for He-Man himself including an amped up version of he and Skeletor in combat and his ever impressive winter gear which includes a flowing fur cape and a heavy battle ax.

The Snakemen element introduced in the first season develops into sheer brilliance in the second (and unfortunately final) season! Not to insinuate that the Masters didn't have their hands full as it was with Skeletor and his minions, this time around the threats to peace and justice come in from all angles in the form of the Skeletor and company, the Snake Men, and the Evil Horde! Yes, you read that correctly- She-Ra's arch nemesis, Hordak, who just so happens to have been Skeletor's mentor, shows up in Season 2 within Skeletor's origin story that finally ties all of the loose threads of Mattel's franchise together once and for all.

I often like to wonder what ground Mike Young's team would have covered had the show continued.  Would they have expanded to include He-Man's sister (She-Ra's) story arc? Could have writer Larry DeTillio revisited some of his wise dragon influence?  A shame that we'll probably never know.

All in all, the show simply continued to build upon the foundation first set by Filmation in the 1980s and thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment, can be yours in its entirety for the cost of each of the single season releases.",1252195200,185,5572,4.856540084388186

3620526,1,B001GUL6BK,"I don't like it as much as i'd hoped to. I've been a MOTU fan since 1982. i didn't like the pseudo-anime at all. not even a little. i also really don't like the whole origin of Skeletor as being King Randor's half-brother. just plain stupid. Skeletor is a demon from another dimension. not some race of blue people. that killed it for me. Just like Darth Vader, if you give the ULTIMATE EVIL an origin as a whiny little brat, it takes all of their power away. i can't watch the SW prequels (awful). and the far too convenient soap opera in this He-Man cartoon ruined it. not quite ""michael bay ruined"" but ruined plenty. watch if you want, but know its a terrible translation. for those who don't know, He-Man was originally from a jungle tribe who left on a quest to save the land. Skeletor was a demon from another dimension, utterly ruthless. the early records, the 12"" vinyl, ""Power of Point Dread/Danger at Castle Grayskull, and the first dozen or so mini comics are the real thing. no purple and pink adam. NO Orko. just barbaric battles (some i'm shocked they got away with). He-Man used his battle ax more than his sword, and not for gardening. look up the the old toy box artwork. beautiful, grim, dark, dingy, violent! then everything was dumbed down for the  cartoon, which i understand. but my best memories of MOTU are the gritty ones. the 2002 cartoon is better than nothing (the toys were great, except He-Man), but you're not missing out on anything epic if you skip this entirely. like the Star Wars prequels.",1499299200,,1526,4.528985507246377

3620578,5,B001GUL6BK,"I was a fan of the original Masters Of The Universe action figure line & Filmation series back in the 80s, so one can imagine how overjoyed I was when Mike Young Productions and Mattel (along with former McFarlane sculptors ""The Four Horsemen"") released the updated animated series and actions figures back in the early 2000s.  I used to catch as much of the animated series as I could whenever I could make it over to the home of a friend or relative who had basic cable TV and purchased most of the action figures, too.  I knew there were a lot of episodes I'd missed, but I was determined to purchase the whole series when it came to DVD at an attractive, irresistible price.  After waiting slightly over a decade and thanks to Amazon, I got the entire complete series on four discs for under $13.  Even though there's a special place in my heart for the original, I preferred this updated version for the faster pace, more action & drama, and more unified, coherent storytelling.  I also enjoyed that this He-Man wasn't an indestructible demigod as in the Filmation series and that the enemies (particularly Count Marzo and The Snakemen) were truly legitimate threats to the hero and his allies.  It was also great to see that the different enemy factions (Skeletor's Evil Warriors and King Hiss' Snakemen) were at cross purposes and it wound up as a complete rout--which I won't spoil here.  If I have any complaint, it's that I was disappointed to see that Hordak & The Evil Horde didn't get to make an appearance.  They were shown in flashbacks and I do believe they would've returned to plague Eternia had MOTU existed for one more season.  Still, I'm satisfied that this series was given a chance to tie up loose ends and not end abruptly or on a cliffhanger.

I highly recommend this entire box set of Masters Of The Universe to MOTU fans, superhero fans, and anyone who loves the blend of Fantasy and Science-Fiction.

I was a bit young back when I use to watch the original and I did not understand much of what I was watching other than enjoying good action.  After many years later of reading on the differences, I realized the original did not have a well written out world/origin story.  This series clears many things up as well as introduces a few new things that make it much better.  With out going into too much, you see how Skeletor becomes  who he is, you learn about Castle Gray Skull, the Elders and pretty much how all things from the past tie into the current time.

3620591,3,B001GUL6BK,"I think they did some good changes with this He-Man. There's a distinctive difference between Prince Adam and He-Man this time around which explains how no one figures out they're one and the same. The characters have been redrawn alright. That being said, I find Castle Grey Skull is drawn oddly, and the Sword of Power is a lot more mechanical than I personally like it. Orko's voice is somewhat prepubescene-breaking for that matter. It's a little irritating. I'm still working through the episodes, but that's my opinion so far. For package delivery and the like, it arrived in good condition. The cd's and box arrived nice and quickly enough. The digital display and colour of the episodes are well-enough done, so the product is recorded well.",1405900800,,749,4.905511811023622

To bad they couldn't keep this going as far as a retro remake. If anyone is reading this in the entertainment industry. Please don't screw up the movie version of this ""when"" it comes out. Try to keep the humor in it without making it overly irritating like the G.I. Joe movies. Also as with the overdone CG in Transformers. It's like looking at a pile of scrap metal. Fingers crossed.

I'm looking forward to seeing all the episodes I didn't get to see. A must buy for a collector of 80's nostalgia.",1389398400,3,669,4.267716535433071

Anyways they do a great job at exploring the characters background and staying within the He-Man Universe. They even strongly hit at who Tyla's dad  is. You will be surprise I know I was. I recommend viewing the videos from the beginning the continuity is very good. I wanted to get the entire series, and since the price was so cheap even if it's just for storage and rarely watch them I like to have it so I get that nostalgic feeling of the past,  I like to say that this cartoon is not cheesy like the original, which was cheese all the way.  All the characters are updated and with a way better look.  I already seen the entire two season except for an random episode here and there.  If you were a He-Man, Masters Of The Universe fan, which would make as old as I am (cough, cough) the you will like this updated version.",1389139200,2,1098,4.204761904761905

3620615,5,B001GUL6BK,"I had been meaning to watch this series for a while now because I was working my way through the old episodes and wondered if there was a remake out there. Im kind of young but I love a lot of the old cartoons (Jem anyone?) so I wanted to finally get around to watching He-Man.  I did some digging and found out about the 2002 redux of series and then I found it here for really cheap so I figured why the hell not?

Right off the bat, the opening is flashy but also pretty funny with Adams opening line about his fabulous magic powers being cut off by ACTION.  The show is kind of cheesy and predictable but still really fun to watch.  I was mostly excited about seeing Skeletor and boy did he deliver.  Hes still such an ass and when it comes down to it you think hed just be able to take over Alternia with the snap of a finger but yknow. The good guys gotta save the day and junk.

Overall: Really fun show! Decent animation quality and everyones redesigns are really cool. Ill definitely waste a lot of afternoons watching it in the near future.",1384819200,,1050,4.173267326732673

3620620,4,B001GUL6BK,"Even though I did not buy this product from Amazon.com,I give this product 4 Stars. I grew up coming home from my last days in Kindergarten and early Elementary school ready to see the old He-Man cartoon. The morals at the end were influential about how to not let other people talk you into doing things you don't feel at ease about and how at times what steps to take or what to tell that person to get them off your shoulder. I also watched some of the She-Ra episodes,Knowing I liked the movie of secret of the sword. This series of today had more variety of voice actors and actress's. The old He-Man that was hand drawn was good back in the 1980's,but this series deserves the award winner. I brought my modernized He-Man DVD complete series from a local store in a mall near me. The first time I was able to notice it was when they showed it on Cartoon Network. Even my younger brother watched a few episodes of it and said it was a good updated version. The storyline makes more sense from what the old TV series showed,I had to rely on the toy line story to give me the information about He-Man's origin instead of the cartoon not giving it on why he had to go on a noble mission. This series also shows the information how He-Man is another image of the sorceress's former male spouse, King Greyskull,and how he tried to prevent both the Snake Men and Hordak from taking total control over territories knowing the castle contained all kinds of personal information of the planet's sources. The old He-Man with John Erwin running his voice had the Prince Valiant hair style,but I liked how King Greyskull's hair style looked with the pig tails on his left and right side coming over his shoulders. It reminded me of the old ancient or medieval viking period. I don't have any critical thoughts about the last episode of Awaken the Serpent. I thought it was a good way for the show to come to a close, even though some of your customers disagree for the series to come to a close. By the way, I am now seeing how She-Ra is going to be shown in her modern day version,DC Comic book wise. That's fine with me. I have all #1 and 5 of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe comic versions. I will probably keep waiting for the company to put out the Number 6 part of the comic book version to see how She-Ra get's unleashed unlike the old secret of the sword in the 1980's version. And how they have Adora working for the Horde,she's not a force captain, her name is Despara. I consider it a more stunning reintroduction to getting Adora modernized and her people of Etheria back in the series. If it never will get shown on TV,it's still okay with me. I consider this DVD set a must have for other He-Man fans.",1379980800,,2715,4.346456692913386

3620651,5,B001GUL6BK,"I grew up watching He-Man in the 80s. As an adult looking back at those 1980's episodes, they are extremely corny almost to the point that they're unwatchable.

The 2002 version of the show is a great new take on this classic story.  The creators stayed very true to the original canon, which will satisfy your nostalgia.  The animation is better, the story line has better continuity, and the character development is much more in-depth.  This whole series is geared toward the adults who watched the 80's version as kids.  They even kept the ""life lesson"" part at the end of each show.
The ""secret identity"" is a heck of a lot more convincing than the 80's version, as here Prince Adam is a teenage kid that lacks many of the admirable qualities of He-Man.  As such, he struggles with his role as Prince Adam when the fighting starts, which adds an adult layer to the show.

I don't usually submit reviews but I saw that there were a couple low-scoring ones.  Frankly, this shocked me enough to submit my own.  This series is outstanding.
Yes, there are anime-style action shots.
Yes, the overall theme of the show is slightly darker than the 80's version, but the old shows were too over-the-top happy anyway.
This discussion is all relative, of course; the 2002 series was a Saturday-morning cartoon and is very kid-friendly.

They managed to keep it kid-friendly while targeting the young(ish) adult audience.

3620655,3,B001GUL6BK,"As a child of the 80s I loved He-Man.  I watched the show every afternoon, and had a lot of the action figures.  I received this boxed set of the new recreation of He-man as a gift, and my son and I have really enjoyed watching it.

Here's what the show has going for it:
1.  The new He-Man stays true to the original story, and even explains a lot of the back-story of the characters.

2.  The Masters of the Universe play a big part in the show, as well as the henchmen for Skeletor rounding out a very interesting cast.

3.  The animation is good, and once again stay true to the original story, all the way down to the color of the speeders.

Here's what the show lacks:
1. while the story does try to stay true, they changed some things, like the animals don't talk(Cringer), and some of the characters don't play as prominent a role as they did in the original series(Orco)

2. Messing with He-Man is hard because all of us kids of the 80s have such good memories of the series, so to change any of it, even for the better at times, doesn't sit well always.

Then I caught some episodes just by chance when channel surfing in college and... well, I was impressed! I still enjoy animation and some kids shows to this day, especially dealing with superheroes, and this series felt very much like a superhero program. If you are familiar with the original series, it takes and is true to the same basic premise: the planet of Eternia is a fantasy realm with magic and advanced technology, with a colorful cast of characters fighting for both the side of good (Masters of the Universe) and evil (Evil Warriors), who all have their own unique abilities like any superhero team. What makes this stand out is they took that premise and added actual developed storylines, action sequences, and brilliant animation. It's not perfect, and is still more than a little cheesy at times (although it never begins to approach the levels of cheese of the original), and is clearly for kids, but it also is a ton of fun, especially if you fondly remember these characters.

I have owned somewhere between 500-700 movies and rented hundreds of others and have never encountered a case like this one. Instead of any kind of disc holder you get this little square tab inside the dvd case which houses 4 dvd's in sleeves and it's not easy to get the disks in and out without bending which may not be a huge concern for you but if you like to keep things nice it's a little annoying. The cover art and case itself is fine but it's the way the dvd's are housed that is absurd/cheap.

Second DVD arrived fast as well but again the Third and Forth discs were slightly scratch and with some fingertips impressions (less this time) and the discs again did not function properly. I haven't contacted Amazon again as it seems that this product is poorly produced (mainly the Third and Forth discs). It's a real shame.

Were as Filmation production team valued story telling and character development as most important features of the original series (which is the primary reasons the original series is considered a classic) with team Korea good story writing and character development are tied for dead last with this He Man incarnation. Instead we get more proof how ""drag your balls Z"" and Pukieman have corrupted and destroyed Asian anime studios creativity . Sadly every episode 5 to 20 minutes is wasted by lame, tired, hackney, cliched , boring Asian anime animation stunts, 2 minutes wasted power posing, 452 back flips then into another power pose , needless long power up then into a 5 minute running charge scene with a flashing backgrounds toward a enemy, a power pose with some quasi 3d back drop stunt,crap. It all adds up to detract from story telling and the characters and I find myself fast forwarding though on average 1/3 of every episode one episode serious only took me 4 minutes to watch. (this is after only two discs I've watch and I seriously doubt I be able to get thru all 4 depressing discs). Also the voice acting is a joke, who knew Stratos and Sean Connery were the same person ? W*F? seriously? The voice acting is really bad but its hidden by the lack of dialog most episodes have. This set is a massive bummer and might appeal to fans of really really bad Korean anime. Wow this was sad. Luckily in the same shipment I got all of the original He man series the full season sets of season 1 and 2 so Ive got the ""real"" He Man which I'm very happy with great sets with all the interview extras and Easter eggs . The only real positives of this set is that they didn't change motif adam is still the crown prince of Enteria.etc.... . And if your a fan of really bad over the top Korean anime devoid of story or characters with lots of flashy cunning animations stunts this could be for you. But what  think it best for is honing your after a six pack of colt 45 mystery science theater 2000 skills because what ever voice acting and dialog you create on the fly (G, Pg, R or XXX) versions will be more entertaining than the voice acting and the stories on this third sad incarnation of He man.

Granted there is a war of good vs. evil going on but in this version of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe there seems to be a civil war brewing within the Masters themselves that was absent in Filmation's version.

I've also noticed that this version seems less colorful, as in the picture itself, than Filmation's version. Yellow seems to be the predominant color throughout much of the episodes.

I don't regret getting this set especially at only $8 and as long as you can get for that low a price, it's worth getting and watching, but compared to Filmation's version I wouldn't pay much more than $8 for it.",1312329600,2,721,4.488549618320611

But the price was almost unbelievably low (still is as of this writing) for the entire series, so I figured I'd take a chance.  And I'm glad I did, because this He-Man is actually a very good series.  True, it lacks some of the lighthearted tone and cheerful optimism of the original, but the fact is, the animation is a LOT better.  Almost old the old characters are here, just with more modern makeovers.  I also like the fact that Prince Adam and He-Man really seem like two different characters, rather than the Clark Kent/Superman-style not-so-secret identity used in the original show.

As a hardcore fan of these characters, I'll always prefer the original series.  It was, after all, the last fully American hand-drawn animated series produced by a major studio.  Most every action cartoon since has been influenced by highly-overrated Japanese ""anime"" (this is apparent in the fight scenes of this series, though no where near as prevalent as it is in the 1990&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Adventures-of-He-Man-Vol-1/dp/B000JLTS76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Adventures of He-Man, Vol. 1</a>).

Contains a PDF comic, interviews audio comentaries and other neat stuff to look forward to, like the episode morals ( hehe and nknowing is half the... no thats another series. Nice! View all this for a nice bargain. I will be enjoying this allot! Just so you know there is another set out there that contains but only a few episodes, I believe its the first 10. Not hapy about that, but I am VERY happy about this.

If you like a remake of a series done properly , unlike the crappy new Voltron series where they blew production money on the CGI and not the bad 2d animation, watch this. I can compare the Eternin universe to ""Krull"", ""thundercats"", ""Thundar the barbarian""
where technology meets the dark ages... Dark Crystal maybe? Its a great show, that shows origins to it's main cast, even origins of a few of the masters. It features great fight scenes and truly evil villains, like in the original comics, not like how lame Skeletor was
being goofy and incompetent, here he is a real threat. I don't mean to rag on the original, but even as a kid I knew the little comic
was what I wanted and not a long toy comercial, I am being honest. vindication! I loved those comics that came with the first figures.
Sure the last ark was not as good as some other episodes, but it was allright. It's better than the new Voltron series which just feels like they blew their cash on CGI, wrote a fanfic, and later used cheap 2d animation for the rest... all remade shows should learn from this one.

3620683,2,B001GUL6BK,"I loved He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, but not THIS series. The original He-Man series had this element of lightheartedness, cheerfulness and optimism that for me constituted part of the essence of He-Man. (One of the things I loved the most about the original series is the theme music.) A later series in which He-Man was dressed in full-length leggings instead of a speedo and was whisked away to a far-future world named Primus managed to preserve much of that sunny spirit, even though much of the cast was changed (which I have to say I wasn't too happy about). But in THIS series that sunny spirit is gone. It now feels grim, serious and heavy. Admittedly the artwork is top-notch, but that doesn't help as far as I'm concerned. It's as if a familiar friend of yours had changed his personality from a cheerful, bright person into a brooding person who constantly pulled a long face. Sometimes this series tries to be humorous, but it just doesn't feel right. Neither does the quasi-Indian background music seem to fit in. Sorry, but I really regretted buying this.

There's honestly something to be said about the proliferation today of fantasy reading and viewing material with this sort of dark and serious content. Whatever happened to that sunny, optimistic type of fantasy? I really wish writers and film/TV producers can put a little more sunshine into what they come up with. If I wanted to watch or read about grim life-and-death struggles and emotionally over-heavy experiences on the part of the protagonists... heck, I wouldn't be watching or reading FANTASY anymore.",1308700800,4,1595,4.885608856088561

The show seems to try desperately to be epic, to be greater than the original 1983 He-Man. Grandiose and epic music, battles, larger than life villians. I couldn't help but feel the producers tried too hard to equal or surpass the original, and in my honest opinion fails at that goal.
Mix that with the less than stellar voice acting (quite frankly I found it terrible), a childish Adam (whom by contrast, even the older young adult Adam from the original was immature, but far more mature than this whiny brat), I have to say that I must pass on this series, and I am glad it cost me only $8 at time of purchase.

3620692,2,B001GUL6BK,"2002 presented the animation studio Mike Young productions with the opportunity to reboot the glorified toy commercial television series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.  This was an opportunity to take the disjointed, broken and generally boring lore of the He-Man universe, and flesh it out into something more meaningful and interesting.  However, it should come as no surprise that the opportunity was completely and entirely wasted, leaving instead an incredibly irritating cartoon with grating characters and contrived conflict.

For a show created to sell toys, you would think there would be an emphasis on the characters so that children would want to have toys of those characters.  It is unfortunate then, that almost every character is terrible, boring or just plain irritating.  Adam, the whinier half of He-Man, could have all of his dialog replaced with one of two sounds: a small child crying or a sarcastic giggle, it is all you really need.  There's Orko, perhaps the most annoying character, but don't worry because he plays a major role in nearly every episode.  Teela, the other character worth mentioning, is best described by some not-too-nice slurs involving female dogs, as her constant reminder to Adam of his cowardice not only get's old quickly, but also just paints her in an incredibly unkind light.  Beyond those three and Skeletor, we'll get to him later, almost every other character is boring and not even worth mentioning.  They appear to have tried and introduce every character at once, but that just makes all of them as paper thin in the original 1983 Advertisement series.

I'll touch on the story, though mostly it is just petty conflict after conflict with Skeletor enacting some other ludicrous plan to defeat He-Man and discover the secret powers of Castle Grayskull followed by He-Man winning because he is stronger.  This is perhaps the least offensive aspect of the show, mostly because the show plays itself off as something meant to focus on characters and action.  The problem with this is that, as I've already covered, the characters are terrible.

In what seems to be supporting the consistency of the bad quality of this commercial, the action follows suit of the characters and is also terrible.  The production values, though clearly higher than the 80's series, are a very deceiving thing.  The biggest problem is that the pacing of the show is almost too fast to keep up with.  Some people will be talking and then every character, especially the unintroduced ones, are spinning their weapons and backflipping their way into some incredibly disorienting action.  Too much nonsensical action happening at one time overwhelms the viewer and it all comes off as boring and thoughtless.  And that is a pretty good way to describe the 2002 ad campaign, boring and thoughtless.  With misused color palettes and some very strange staging, the show is a mess visually which very strongly translates to the action.

The DVD packaging could be described best as shoddy, with DVD sleeves instead of actually being placed in the case.  The sound varies pretty frequently in volume, and the video quality has frequent artifacting and is generally below expectations.  The extras and number of episodes of the show make up for that what with it being less than $10 at this point.

And finally we come to the single positive at a long list of negatives, Skeletor.  Skeletor is presented as the commercial's villain, though he is far too pathetic to ever be considered the rival of the strongest man in the universe.  This modern Skeletor continues the Skeletor tradition of having an insanely silly voice, making everything he does the funniest, and therefore best, part of the show.  As an example, the first time Skeletor faces off with He-Man he dramatically introduces himself, ""Surrender? To whom do you think you are speaking? I AM SKELETOR, OVERLORD OF EVIL.""  After some probably necessary staff twirling he slams the magic stick into the ground and summons forth a large burst of presumably evil magic.  This is quickly deflected by He-Man, hitting Skeletor and knocking him off of a nearby cliff where he would be lost for over a minute.  These pathetic beatings continue and Skeletor is reduced to an admittedly hilarious comic relief character.  If he were featured more the show would probably be pretty entertaining, but as it stands the bursts of hilarity are too far and few to salvage this.

Between this and the 80's ad campaign, I would say go with the 80's one.  In that show everything is terrible, but very consistently hilarious, the characters are blank slates but remain unoffensive and often deliver lines in a way that is funny to the point of actual laughter.  Skeletor is also better in that show, and more frequently appears, offering an overall funnier experience.

The biggest recommendations I can give to this show is that it is less than $10 and a number of extras are present.  If you think that the silliness of Skeletor justifies the $8 asking price then by all means go for it.  If you are expecting a good action fantasy show with a unique and interesting lore, then you are barking up the wrong tree.  In fact in that case you would do better with just about any other show that fits into a similar genre.  So don't buy it, or do I guess.",1297987200,3,5330,4.894209354120267

3620695,5,B001GUL6BK,"I often put things in my shopping cart, intending to save them for later, and I accidentally bought this along with other items - without remembering I'd purchased it!  It's the first time I've ever done that in all my years on Amazon, and I was rolling my eyes when it arrived instead of something else I had expected (it had just been a whim on a childhood memory).  Well, I finally popped in the DvD just to take a peek, and I ended up watching the whole thing.  What a great mistake!

Wow!  The art quality is wonderful and story actually has continuity.  Most of my favorite characters are back in action, and we get a lot of Evil-Lyn action (one of my faves) not to mention an incredible amount of backstory.  We see some awesome flashbacks and if you're a fan of the series I think you'll have a lot of ""ohhhh, that's cool"" moments.  The morals are even kind of fun... in a cheesy, wah wah wah sort of way (but it also made me feel good, like being a kid again).

3620696,4,B001GUL6BK,"The series was abruptly ended. They never got around to revealing Tela's purpose or introducing She-Ra or even wrapping up the storyline. The first couple episodes were cool, but the series got dumb after that until I reached episode 20 or so. Then, it started getting interesting again. Overall, the animation is very low quality, and the episode plots leave something to be desired, but the characters are very memorable, and this is a brilliant reboot of the He-Man story. When I bought this product, it was only $7.99, so I think it was worth the price. It offered many hours of entertainment and a little nostalgia.

Disc 4 includes a comic for episode 40 (show lasted only 39 episodes), but don't think of that as an ending to the story. Episode 40 was merely a continuation of the story from episode 39, but it was a very interesting comic (the art is good), so it is still worth checking out.",1296518400,,900,4.590062111801243

3620698,5,B001GUL6BK,"""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete Series"" (2002) is a real treat for longtime fans of this franchise.  Unlike the original series, which was primarily created to sell toys, this new He-Man series came into being after McFarlane Toys' famous designers, ""The Four Horsemen"", were commissioned by Mattel to redesign the Masters of the Universe franchise, creating beautiful character designs for all of the old favorites.  In accordance with the attempted relaunch, Mattel also commissioned a new television series, in which the writers really sat down and thought out the Masters of the Universe world.  Origins are expanded and make more sense, characters are more realistic and better defined, the animation is beautiful, and they use every single character ever created for Masters of the Universe, something that the original series didn't quite do.  At the same time, it makes many references to the original series, from basic story ideas to transitions, and of course, the base story of Prince Adam and the Kingdom of Eternia, with their imp friend Orko that all share the secrets of Castle Grayskull.  This is He-Man as we always wished it was, and as a result, I highly recommend it.",1295654400,,1210,5.060301507537688

This is non-stop entertainment and a lively animated He-man show that should have gotten more episodes during its run.  A clean, fantastic look to this show highlights the obvious upgrades to every character from the original Masters of the Universe.

Every episode is jam packed with heavy pathos and heart-wrenching developements.  Every twist and story thread matters, every character plays a role and real peril is at every corner.

3620715,5,B001GUL6BK,"This series is great and I thank Mike Young for his retread of it. Let me clarify here: I was born in the '80s and there is just no topping the original He-man/She-ra canon for me. Still, of the two retreads of the He-Man line, Young's MOTU is by far the greater.

In one particular aspect, this series even does a couple of things that the original series did not. First of all, it taps well into Eternia's history (something that Filmation occasionally did in one or two episodes) and the history of the council of Elders. More importantly, however, it takes viewers back to the time when Prince Adam had first learned of his destiny to be He-Man and, albeit briefly, before Skeletor had actually become Skeletor. Another thing that I personally owe this series is that it visited many of my favorite (underused) supporting characters of the original series and even gave them very important roles in their own episodes. Until now, Syklone (""The Mystery of Anwat Gar"") had appeared in two Filmation episodes and was given an approximate total of 45 seconds of screen time between the two. Now, he has an episode devoted to his joining of the Masters and his new character role (a samurai???) is well thought out. Two-Bad (""The Monster Within"") had also only appeared in only a handful of Season Two episodes before and, like many of the characters shy of He-Man, Teela and Orko, was hardly fleshed out in the '80s series. In Mike Young's reincarnation, we get to see Two-Bad in his (""their"") original form(s) as a pair of bounty hunters; only becoming one because of Skeletor's magic. Even Roboto (""Roboto Gambit"") was given a part of his moment to shine! A couple of villains in He-Man's rogues gallery outside of Skeletor's service, Count Marzo (""Mekaneck's Lament"") and Evilseed (""Orko's Garden"") even made their triumphant returns.

This new series even saw the appearance of Stinkor (""The Sweet Smell of Victory"") and King Hiss and the Snakemen; all characters whom, until now, had been characters in Mattel's toyline but had never once appeared on screen! Still, even with these new characters, my personal favorites, Mekaneck and Buzz-off, were still made one regular Master and one ally, respectively. In these aspects, we owe Mike Young a great deal for reintroducing this classic show and we owe Mill Creek a great deal for picking up where BTC/BCI would have unfortunately left off when they closed their doors. The DVD collection even includes the end of episode moral segments that I had never seen before when Young's MOTU was on television!

However, not even this (or even the '80s) gems are completely flawless and all that I can complain about this one is that it didn't last nearly long enough. For instance, it would have been interesting to see what Mike Young could have done with Granamyr and the Darksmoke-based dragon characters (they already had access to Larry DiTillo, the original writer of each of those classic episodes). Also, we caught a brief glimpse of the direction that Hordak's character was being taken and it would have made for a great extension of the She-ra canon. Unfortunately, this did not happen as of yet when the series ended.

Overall: a fantastic retread that actually dared to go in several directions that even the classic original would not.",1276992000,,3297,4.850799289520427

Having grown up on the original show and it's sequel/spiritual successor/spin-off, the toys, and the live-action film I can safely say the following:

This show blows the original out of the water, in quite literally every way. This show is more faithful to the original toyline's storyline. The writing actually forms cohesive story-arcs. The animation quality is top-notch, not only when compared to the low-budget Filmation original, but especially when compared to other 2002 cartoon contemporaries. A much more mature and fleshed out storyline is presented with sleek stylish action, wonderful voice acting, music, and steller production quality.

The title is poorly listed and should be ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002): The Complete Series"". The 2002 is not listed in the Title or Item Description, only in the Editorial Review and in Reviews/Comments. Not changing the title to be correct is misrepresentation and misleading advertising. Not many are even aware of or care for this knock-off series and think they are getting the original. Some probably even got it and don't remember the show well enough to realize they got the wrong one. People use tactics like this on Auction sites to get people to see their products that wouldn't otherwise see it and it is bad business for Amazon to do the same. Anyone searching for He-Man will still find it with 2002 in the title, so there is no reason they can't correctly list the item.

Now that being said,i will start by saying this version of he-man is very good also(the 80`s he-man is just such a strong character it`s hard to follow up after him,but they did an excellent job)i agree with the one perosn who complained about adam being whinny i felt this way too but now i understand why he was potrayed this way.the adam from the 80`s has been doing this for awhile and is a bit older than this adam. THE ABSOULTE BEST PART OF THIS SERIES HAS TO DO WITH 2 THINGS.1 ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS ARE AWESOME YOU GET ALOT OF ORIGINS,SO IT`S JUST NOT RANDOM PEOPLE APPEARING.AND ALL THESE CHARCATERS HAVE A GREAT BACK STORY AND DEPTH.IT`S LIKE THE IMAGES YOU MAY HAVE HAD AS A CHILD WHILE PLAYING WITH THE ACTION FIGURES.OUTSTANDING STORY TELLING.2 IS JUST A RUB OFF OF 1 IN THE FACT THAT THE STORY IS ONGOING AND NOT DISJOINTED LIKE THE 80`S VERSION,THE WHOLE 39 EPISODES(AND IT`S A SHAME THAT IT ENDED THERE,THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO COME.READ THE WIKIPEDIA)ARE CONNECTED.THE BONUS MATERIAL IS VERY GOOD.My only problem so far is the dvd case is cheap and is falling apart,close it gently.lol.and one of the episodes skips but it acts diffrently on diffrent players so it may be something i can fix.highly highly recommened if you grew up with it,if you have kids,or if you are a fan of good anime",1264982400,2,2508,4.43073593073593
3620729,5,B001GUL6BK,great show to bad it was canceled before it could really  find its place in the fandom. i still think it was better than the 80s  he man.. hopefully they will bring this version of he man back soon..,1264464000,,199,4.076923076923077
3620730,1,B001GUL6BK,"The product looks great, and fro the price seems unbeatable considering they're still selling the individual seasons for 20 dollars or more but I wouldn't know if it's all on there since when i try to watch it it won't go past the third episode of the first disk, i've tried different players and every time it freezes up at the same episode, slows down, and you can't just skip it or go to the next chapter.  I got so frustrated im not watching it and it doesnt seem worth sending back.  I'm probalbly not going to make a purchase from this seller again or any product the product maker has.",1263686400,6,592,4.324324324324325

3620732,5,B001GUL6BK,I actually also own the original series and I must say this is really a nice update. Unfortunately we never got this updated version screened in Singapore so I took a risk to buy it. It is really enjoyable and the CGI is really good.,1263081600,,233,4.2
3620733,5,B001GUL6BK,"This is the full series DVD set.  Includes the first 10 episodes that were released separately in a previous release, so you will NOT have to purchase both to have a complete set.  I have enjoyed this incarnation of the classic TV cartoon show.  The show does have a lot of action, and there are definite separations between the good and bad characters in the show.  The good guys are very good and the bad guys are evil.  The character profiles and morals (or lack of morals) are well defined.

I do have some warnings for parents looking to buy this for there kids.  The last 10 or so episodes are pretty violent, dark, and can be pretty severe for young children.  Some anonymous characters are killed or more specifically ""eaten"" by the main antagonist.  This seemed pretty gruesome to me but Judge for yourselves; watch them with your kids to evaluate the content or answer questions your kids may have.  There are some minor occult references and many references to mysticism.  I don't recommend this video for children under 6 years old.

Even with the previously mentioned violence, I'm pleased with my purchase and glad to add this to my cartoon collection.",1262649600,13,1166,4.689655172413793
8307198,5,B001GUL6BK,"This show definitely flew under the radar compared to the original, but was a fantastic adaptation which makes you wish the people who made this were put in charge of more of the remakes we've seen these past few years. They understood what was great about the original and gave it new dimensions, the characters were faithful to the original but made it cooler. And you gotta love the always optimistic Skeletor, constantly getting foiled but laughing it off at the end of each episode. We could all learn from Skeletor's example.",1525132800,,531,4.782608695652174

8307204,5,B001GUL6BK,"This was a great cartoon series. It was a fun sci fi fantasy action adventure epic with fun characters and great storytelling. The animation was really well done. It got to explain a lot of stuff like how Skeletor became Skeletor for example that the original series never got around to. It is sad that this series got canclled before it could be finished.
