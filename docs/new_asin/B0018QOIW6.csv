8270678,5,B0018QOIW6,I wish there were books available on Emile Norman's life and work. I saw this program on PBS a few years ago and his gentle spirit and  beautiful art left an impression on me. I am an artist myself and love to appreciate art of others as well. I had to purchase this DVD to watch again. It's a reminder there's a lot of good in the world and people in it who reached the best of themselves.,1458432000,,390,4.0
8270679,5,B0018QOIW6,"Emile Norman's art is nothing less than inspirational. One can see the depth of each of his creations even at a glance, but when you examine his work up close, the detail is breathtaking. That kind of care and dedication is what I strive to bring to my work as a singer/instrumentalist/director, where you could take a slice of the finished work and find that the beauty and quality go all the way to its core. He was very musical and poetic in his art, as he possessed a love of music, especially that of J.S. Bach. I was a choral singer for many years at the Carmel Bach Festival, and I remember seeing him in his purple beret at almost every performance. The DVD is very lovingly produced and succeeds in displaying his enormous talent, love for life and good friends, and the touching relationship with the love of his life.",1415750400,,828,4.453947368421052

8270683,5,B0018QOIW6,"Emile Norman attended art school for one day. His teacher told him he did his assignment wrong, and Emile quit.  Together with his partner Brooks Clemens, he went on to sculpt, create glass and wood mosaics and build and live in the mountains of Big Sur.

This film is a touchstone for those who swim against the tide.  Beginning in the 1940's, it follows Emile Norman through the art world, film sets and galleries of California, New York City and back to Big Sur and Carmel.  From mosaic zebras to marble statues to the 40 foot marble glass window on the Masonic Temple in San Francisco, Norman not only followed his own artistic visions, he invented many of his own tools, techniques and materials.

But a summary can't describe this film or this artist, or how much this film means to me as an artist attempting to create my own style and survive in realistic economic times.  I treasure my copy of this film and wish all people would see it.",1229990400,6,946,4.502923976608187
