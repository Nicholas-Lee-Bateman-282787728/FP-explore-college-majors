8086333,4,B000BFJM0S,"Here we have another Spaghetti Western driven by revenge this time utilizing the Django character in 'W DJANGO' aka 'MAN CALLED DJANGO'-1971 .  Although not  a direct sequel to director Sergio Corbucci's 'DJANGO'-1966 with Franco Nero, the name is utilized throughout and we have our anti hero searching for the four leaf clover gang, thugs who raped and murdered his wife and finally reaching a town which is hanging an accused horse thief who may know the whereabouts of the gang.  Anthony Steffen is excellent in an intensely, cold performance as he opens a music box which triggers the memory of each rapist before their execution reminiscent of the musical locket utilized in Sergio Leone's 'FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE'- 1965 .  There is also a nice surprise twist at the climax.  The direction is by Edward G. Muller aka Eduardo Mulargia who also helmed 'CJAMANGO'-1967 with Ivan Rassimov and here gives fresh overtones to many cliches already done to death.  With delirious photography by Marcello Masciocchi and an excellent music score by Piero Umiliani, this oater is a real hoot.  Alas, the transfer leaves much to be desired.  The company Dagored releases the film in its 1.85 aspect ratio but it looks like its derived from a second generation VHS transfer which had a splicy, well used negative in its original Italian language, we should be grateful for accurate English subtitles.  The film is so good that you seem to forget the condition and although the title is rare,  we have to be satisfied with this release till the good one comes along(if ever). Recommended for die hard Spaghetti fans, this film contains one of Steffen's best performances and shows he should be right up there with the best actors in the Western genre.  The four stars are for the film alone and not for the release by Dagored.  It also has a stills/poster gallery and trailers for other Dagored releases.  The quality of the trailers may show the viewer whats in store for them in purchasing from this company.",1315008000,2,2001,4.832844574780059
8086334,4,B000BFJM0S,"First of all the title: apparently ""W"" is an abbreviation for ""Viva"" in Italian; so read the title as VIVA DJANGO!, not to be confused with the Terence Hill film with that exact title. The disc, produced by Dagored, is in Italian with English subtitles. The print used is cut, running only 80 minutes rather than the 90 listed in most sources. There are several obvious, jarring jump-cuts where cuts have been made. Anthony Steffen stars as the mysterious stranger rolling into town to find his wife's killers, with Glauco Onorato as his sidekick. The pair is reminiscent of Eastwood and Wallach, in a good way, as they have great chemistry. Steffen, despite his rather inexpressive visage, is strangely charismatic and really pulls you into the action. (I first saw, and liked, him in BLOOD AT SUNDOWN). The story rolls along briskly, with a nice mix of action, drama, and humor. This is for sure a ""B"" movie, but the good kind: it has modest aspirations and nails them. Recommended, with bonus points for a fabulous theme song!",1267574400,2,1029,4.786516853932584
8086335,1,B000BFJM0S,"While not a exemplary example of the genre, 'A Man Called Django' (aka W Django!) you could do worse. What you may not be able to do worse with is this inexcusably bad transfer from Dagored. Dagored continues to put out what are some of the worst discs to date. The source quality is worse than a second generation copy of a VHS tape. The image is drastically cropped from the original 2:35.1 to 1.70:1. And it is also the cut version missing over 10 minutes of footage.

Dagored is a company to avoid at all costs. If you need to see this movie, rent it. To date, it is the only version available with English subtitles.",1134864000,10,621,4.3076923076923075
