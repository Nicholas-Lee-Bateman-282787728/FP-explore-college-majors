8236118,1,B000ZN805E,"Some new interviews by first Pantera band members (Not Terry Glaze) and other people. One thing that really bothered me was the music playing in the background, it's as if they are saying it's Pantera but any person that has heard Pantera knows it isn't AT ALL. Not worth your money.",1361232000,3,283,4.568627450980392
8236119,1,B000ZN805E,"I was cool seeing old Pantera footage, but they did fly by. No Pantera music. It was like a VH1 knock-off. Nice effort, bad result. I could of done one better on youtube. Waste of my money as well.",1230422400,7,197,4.076923076923077
8236120,1,B000ZN805E,"What a huge disappointment. The ""rare archive footage"" flies by a few seconds a time with no audio track. I can barely get through this. Insulting. I wasted my money.",1210723200,14,166,4.566666666666666
