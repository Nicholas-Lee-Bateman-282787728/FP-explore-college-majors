7987718,5,B00008WT65,"After 11 discs which crisscrossed the plot of the Gundam Fight and the Devil Gundam, the former is now finally over. One of the Shuffle Alliance has become the champion (guess who?) and it looks like life will return to normal...sadly, not so. After the revelations of the last disc, Rain has decided that it would be better if she and Domon never saw each other again. Domon avoids this issue until he receives an SOS from Dr Mikamura- the Devil Gundam is back and it's after Rain! Domon heads off to the Neo-Japan colony to rescue her but is attacked by Wong in the Walter Gundam. The former ruler has now been DG cell infected and is determined to take revenge on Domon and claim the Devil Gundam again for himself. Domon receives a final gift from Master Asia- Fuunsaikii, his noble steed. Domon returns and easily defeats Wong and then heads into space for his final battle with the Devil Gundam. Behind him are the rest of the SA and the other surviving fighters... G goes out with a bang. On this disc are some of the show's finest episodes. You'll see why us fans of the original version think Devil Gundam fits Domon's nemesis MUCH better then Dark Gundam and some of the best acting from the Japanese cast, especially Seki Tomkazu's incredible job as Domon.",1057795200,,1267,4.537117903930131
