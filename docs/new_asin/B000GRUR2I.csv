My question is... when will this show be complete on DVD?  There are only two seasons and everything else seems to get the attention except good and wholesome programming.  Won't someone look into this and make an effort to get these 2 seasons complete to dvd so that we may sit with our own children and be able to teach them how to be kind to others, say yes ma'am and no ma'am, and to have just good 'ol fashion manners to help shape their life-long character? It has to start somewhere!",1331510400,2,724,4.421052631578948
