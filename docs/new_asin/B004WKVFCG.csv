Bob mentions the snag John Browning had with Winchester buying his design for the Auto-5, but gets it a bit off. A man by the name of Thomas Gray Bennett, who I think married Oliver Winchester's grand daughter, and had became the president of Winchester, didn't want to make the new automatic shotgun, because it would take away sales for the 1897, and later on, the upcoming model 1912 pump shotgun. Plus, Bennett refused Browning any royalties, as this was the first time he asked for them. At this, John Browning broke ties with Winchester, and had an appointment with Remington, but their president dropped dead of a heart attack just before Browning could see him, and that left Browning to take his gun to FN in Belgium. Remington finally did start making the gun, along with Savage. The 11-48 Remington was based on the recoiling design of the Remington 11 later on, along with other manufacturers like Franchi. Its funny that now Browning owns what is left of Winchester, and that this was the biggest blunder that Winchester ever made.

Anyhow, Bob shows the guns operation with several cut-aways, and it is explained well. He also mentions how the brake works, and how the rings need to be set. Last, he shows why the Remington 11-48 was sort of a flop, and why they changed the design.",1363478400,,1424,4.624505928853755
