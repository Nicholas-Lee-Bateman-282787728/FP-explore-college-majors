7989453,5,B0000959MY,"For anyone who's been to Burning Man, this movie is a must-see.  The festival is so often misunderstood, portrayed in the news media as hippies on parade in the desert.  In reality, it is much more:  a radical, temporary community which arises in the desert for one week each year.  Burning Man is like a laboratory for creative people to discover new ways to interact outside of commericialized mass culture.  But least understood, as this movie shows, is how hard the participants work to put on each year's event.

""Burning Man: Just Add Couches"" is a hilarious account of four newbies who go to Burning Man for the first time and try to set up their own theme camp at the festival.  They aren't truly prepared, and they make just about every first-timers' mistake, but in the end, the festival changes them - for the better.",1107820800,3,828,4.63013698630137
7989454,5,B0000959MY,"The Burning Man Festival is a large, spectacular event held each year in the desert of Nevada.  Every year the news cameras air about three minutes of fire-breathing sculptures, the Man himself being torched, and body-painted San Francisco freaks running around.  But the event is made possible by a lot of work from dedicated participants, which this video documents like no other I've seen.
The four protagonists of ""Burning Man: Just Add Couches"" go to Burning Man to try and subvert the freaky, pagan exhibitionism with a wry bit of satire -- the ""Couch Potato Camp,"" where festival participants can go and lie around and do nothing.
The heart of this documentary is not, of course, watching people sit on couches, but immersing the viewer into the frenzy of preparation of putting it together.  Who knew it was so hard to set up a living room in the middle of nowhere?
For anyone curious about what goes on behind the scenes at a large festival like Burning Man, this is the video to watch.",1066867200,5,995,4.706896551724138
7989455,5,B0000959MY,"I've been to Burning Man a couple of times, and I've always struggled to explain it to my friends and co-workers.  All they ever ask me about is how many drugs I did while I was there.
I've also seen a few different movies made at the event.  Most of them are pretty good, but none of them I'd seen really showed what it was like to make art at Burning Man, which for me is what makes that event so beautiful.
When I watched ""Burning Man: Just Add Couches,"" I laughed and laughed, and immediately showed it to all my friends.  ""See, this is what we do at Burning Man,"" I told them. ""We work our butts off.""
The movie follows the filmmaker and three of his buddies as they prepare to go to Burning Man and build a ""theme camp"" there.  They have the idea to bring couches to the desert with them, and make a cozy middle-American living room for revelers to escape the heat.  To their eternal woe, these guys think ""oh, this will be easy.'  (How many times has somebody assured me that about a project!)
All sorts of things go wrong.  A shipping company damages one of their installations.  The truck they rented is too small.  The generator they've rented is too loud.  During the festival, they get lost driving across the featureless playa, which freaks out their cameraman, causing him to abandon the project and leave for home.  As they describe these misadventures, the guys remain deadpan and totally hilarious.
I do think that you can only really appreciate this movie if you've been to Burning Man, or are at least familiar with it.  Then you can relate to what the filmmaker and his friends endure trying to make art in the desert.",1065398400,9,1638,4.423333333333333
7989456,1,B0000959MY,"If you are curious about what Burning Man is about look elsewhere.  If you are interested in a boy scout style adventure, that spends 80 percent of the time off the playa, this video is for you.",1064620800,5,194,4.243243243243243
7989457,5,B0000959MY,"What happens when you return to Woodstock for the 90's to capture the experience again and everything goes wrong?  You shoot what you can and get your compadres to reflect on their disappointment.
This video once again gives us the exhibitionists, eccentrics and other bizarros first caught on Winston's 1997 The Burning Man Festival but it is perhaps best at capturing the strain of keeping up the act.  Shot through the filmmakers' and other festival-goers desire to ""get what they want"" out of the fest is the strain of disillusionment tunneling its way into the fun.  Everyone's older now and the discomfort of the desert environment eats away at their enjoyment like plague.  It's a manifesto on growing up and a brilliant expose of the weary hazards of eternal adolescence.",1052697600,4,779,4.969230769230769
