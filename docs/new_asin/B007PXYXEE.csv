5104582,4,B007PXYXEE,"The late 50's were loaded with sci-fi stories about space aliens doing nefarious things. What a delight to see a pleasant film about little kids making the ""powers that be"" look like idiots. I first saw this back in the 50's, released on a double bill with ""Kronos"" as a drive-in double feature. (Both are good films). This film resonated with me a lot, and I never forgot it. Glad to know it's on (a very good) DVD.

The Cold War was brewing, and the idea to lay low til you know what the hell is actually going on is a lesson well portrayed. I like this film a lot, more than just a ""guilty pleasure"". It actually has something to say.",1363651200,3,637,4.221311475409836

5104585,2,B007PXYXEE,"This is one of those titles I had seen in the movies originally on a theater screen, and then on television but hasn't been on in years...So I was overjoyed when it was released just recently by OLIVE FILMS on bluray for the first time in any video format. I must say aside from minor pleasures, the film is pretty silly and hasn't been given a proper restoration of any kind. There is some minor gatefloat in portions, some scratches and a bit more grain than should be too...Unless (as is the case with me for personal reasons) this film is one of your wants, I wouldn't waste your money. See when I was a kid myself and my long deceased younger brother Michael used to go and see double and triple features twice a week during summer...And THAT is purely why I wanted the flick.",1349568000,3,781,4.3561643835616435
5104586,4,B007PXYXEE,"""except ye become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.""
(St. Matthew, Ch. 18, v. 3)

This is a William Alland production. You remember his productions.
Such unforgettables as:
Citizen Kane
The Devil and Daniel Webster
It Came from Outer Space (one of my favorites)
Creature from the Black Lagoon
This Island Earth
Tarantula
The Deadly Mantis

And many more.

This one is a toughie to find.

There is a nice spooky movie credits however it's missing the obligatory sci-fi introduction narrative.

The U.S. is about to launch a hydrogen bomb satellite to protect up from the other side. The other side may already have done so. Someone or something has other plans and a unique ally.

Sandy Descher plays Eadie Johnson; here she gets to talk instead of just screaming ""Them!""

A little deviation on this review. Looking at the trailer that the family lives in on the beach I noticed the glass louvers on the door. Back in the 60s after school I had a job manufacturing the glass louvers. It brings back old times.",1342224000,,1041,4.686813186813187
5104587,5,B007PXYXEE,"Producer William Alland and Director Jack Arnold were responsible for some of the best and most innovative Science Fiction films of the fifties. Olive Films has released an underrated gem which happens to be Arnold's Sci-Fi swan song , 1958's 'THE SPACE CHILDREN' into the digital age.  A beautiful anti war statement made when this type of film was few and far between at that time, it emerges as Arnold's most personal film.  Never has his use of landscapes been more realized. Just as he used the desert as his tableau in 'IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE'-1953 and 'TARANTULA'-1956 , he surpasses his water and underground cavern settings of his masterpiece 'THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON'-1954 by placing his alien visitor in a cave within walking distance of the ocean causing the setting to be calm yet menacing in each frame brilliantly realized by photographer Ernest Laszlo.  The performances by the children are excellent and even the adults are shown in different lights by being shown the errors of their ways.  The icing on the cake is the eerie music score by Van Cleve who also graced Director Eugene Lourie's 'THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK' the same year.  It emerges as a poignant children's fable predating the menacing alien-invasion-by-children thriller Director Wolf Rilla's 'VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED'-1960 and its sequel, Director Anton Leader's 'CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED'-1963.  The transfer is stunning with a beautiful 1.85 transfer which is just as good as the BLU-RAY release and has an original trailer as its only extra. Highly recommended and kudos once again to Olive Films for excavating this underrated film to Sci-Fi Fans of all ages.",1341705600,19,1656,5.003636363636364
5104588,4,B007PXYXEE,"If you're read some the other reviews here, you may notice I was intially a bit skeptical of Olive Films, having not been familiar with them until now.  Well, I'm happy to report that the company (actually a part of Paramount, it turns out) did a fine job with this mostly-forgotten Jack Arnold drive-in sci-fi film.  While it is true that a 50+ year old low-budget film, even in 1080p, will never have the shine of a recent film shot in high definition, The Space Children is, for the most part, remarkably clear.

The film itself concerns an alien being taking possession of the children of some rocket scientists.  While the film's promotional materials played up the otherworldly menace, the story itself is actually fairly subdued.  This is science fiction that favors talking over action, and although there are some nifty effects, they are sparingly used.  The film's anti-war message places it in the company of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still-Special-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001G7PWYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still (Special Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] rather than the typical alien-invasion films of the period.

As the title of the review states, this is a ""bare bones"" video release.  All you get is the movie.  Which is a shame, because there is a great theatrical trailer that can be easily found on the internet.  And director Jack Arnold was a generally well-liked and prolific genre filmmaker, so a featurette or even trailers from his other films would have been a nice touch.  But as someone who collects and adores films of this type, I consider it a minor miracle that a Blu-ray release of ""The Space Children"" ever saw the light of day.  So for that, I am grateful.  And I'm most satisfied to see that Olive Films is a company that cares about these old films.

Bottom line: This is a must-have for fans of 50's science fiction.  And because this is the first official release of the film on video, there's a good chance that many genre fans haven't even seen it.",1340150400,26,2075,5.152238805970149
5104589,5,B007PXYXEE,"I really liked this movie. The picture quality was very good and so was the sound. I noticed a very familiar monster. It looked like the Horta in a Star Treck show. It was the usual 1950""s drive in movie. But I really love these movies.",1340150400,4,236,4.1521739130434785
5104590,4,B007PXYXEE,"This is not about kids in space, but Jack Arnold, borrowing a page about telepathy from Roger Corman, fashions a wonderfully poetic and atmospheric film; a visual delight that you seem to feel as well as watch. It made my day to discover this is slated for Blu-ray and if you are a boomer, you've got a smile on your face already. Do it right, Olive.

5104591,2,B007PXYXEE,"As a cultural artifact the movie IS... interesting. But to give it 5 or 4 stars comparable to The Day the Earth Stood Still... is silly.
Yet... their themes are the same... Cold War and Hollywood thought wether correct in their cases or not.

At the time of the movie and in 1952  when The Day the Earth Stood Still was made... there was an internal war of sorts going on in the West but specifically in America. Those who say that this period was the time of the ""Red Scare"" are lying... and very often... tribalist in their thought processes sublimated via Marxist thought, now magically after decades of propaganda and mass murder trauma... ""Neocons"" that is, pro Israeli dual citizen fanatics.

And... I agree with the ideas in both of these films that humanity in its technocratic development especially the ""military industrial complex"" and the Israeli Lobby in our period... are moving humanity towards total war and after onward to total control.

At the time of the movie... the opposition, largely communist in Hollywood were not in power, their critique worked because of the inclinations of a Christian culture whose ideal still echoed brotherhood for all humanity... but over the last 60 years... the roles have been reversed with America now under a power that no longer pretends to be about a better world through some form of socialism but is now about raw hegemony via ""terror"" psychic control through faux ""terrorist"" acts, that drives the West psychically, all towards world domination and a world state where freedom is being redefined as mass needs... in relation to a minority's prejudices and extremely dangerous 2000 year old semi psychotic vision of itself.

The movie is a low budget peek into the first stages of that effort that has indeed carried the day.

America is now a lap dog of more powerful groups. Here in Space Children we see one of the tools... propaganda bends our emotions. First start with idealism... using fear... then take control and flip the script towards anyone who dares to confront or stand up to the real psychopaths in the world, use greed and over time... the bureaucracy and military get the message.

The use of the New Testament at the end was typical of the time... and amusing since the group in control of Hollywood hates Christianity but is quite willing to use it for their group purposes. We see this today as Last Days movies and Zombie movies which create anxiety and align with the absurd idea that the Middle East is more important to the world's real potential than any other place on Earth. All to drive a willingness to send our children who like this movie are still idealists... in service of anther little country whose racial group ironically have nothing to do with the Bible's borrowed... ...  stories! Sad, pathetic really.",1462060800,2,2802,4.8108108108108105
5104592,3,B007PXYXEE,"I remember seeing this when it was new, so wanted to see it again.  It's your typical corny 50's ""monster"" movie, so if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.  Not the best, but not boring like so many of them.",1458000000,,220,3.977272727272727
5104593,4,B007PXYXEE,"BOTTOM LINE: You may enjoy this low budget sci-fi flick in its MST3K version more, as it is high on talk and low on action & monsters. Even so, I found THE SPACE CHILDREN an interesting diversion from the typical rayguns, spaceships & radiation-soaked monstrosities that occupy most 50's sci-fi. I cautiously recommend it for the curious and folks who enjoy collecting older, obscure films. 4 STARS

THE STORY: America is developing an orbiting hydrogen weapons platform as a means of leveling the playing field with other countries (friendly & foreign) who are working on the same idea. Project technicians & their families are sequestered at a remote seaside location adjacent to the rocket facility until the launch is complete. Shortly after arriving, the various scientists' young children witness a strange phenomenon near the ocean's shore - one the adults apparently do not see. Investigating along a rocky coastline the kids discover a glowing brain/blob thing, which quickly takes them over. Under its guidance the tykes work to sabotage the upcoming missile launch. What is the alien intelligence's true intention? Will it succeed?

THOUGHTS: Interesting sort-of variation on The Village of The Damned, only THE SPACE CHILDREN was actually released two years before DAMNED was. The kids are all pretty good, though the producer & director wisely let the most talented ones have the bigger parts. Michel Ray gets the lion's share of dialogue as the leader of the group. His younger brother is played by Johnny Crawford, (best known for his role as Chuck Conners' young son Mark McCain on TV's ""The Rifleman""). Sandy Descher plays the kids' second in command. (Just four years earlier she cemented her status in sci-fi iconography as the little girl who wanders the desert in a state of shock, before her big freak out scene in Warner's outstanding 1954 big bug classic THEM!) Among the adult players in the small cast are Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester from TV's ""Addams' Family""), and a brief turn by Russell Johnson (the Professor on ""Gilligan's Island""), playing against type as the drunken, abusive step-father to one of the kids. The plot is fast & straightforward, with a few neat twists thrown in. The short runtime is probably a good thing, in that the film is mercifully devoid of padding that often fills & kills these sci-fi programmers. I'd only heard of this film prior to buying the Blu-ray and was glad to discover it. It's not a great film but this little sci-fi flick has a few good moments and I think it's worth a look - especially for fans of such fare. While there are no scaly whatzits lumbering about, the glowing brain is kind of disgustingly cool. Thankfully, the kids are all fairly engaging as the dramatic center of this obscure sci-fi mystery.

THE BLU-RAY: Olive Films has established a rep for unearthing rare, older titles and giving them a decent hi-def home release. That trait continues with their Blu-ray offering of Paramount Picture's THE SPACE CHILDREN. The focus is good and the film looks rather nice, but it isn't without problems. Chief among these is a high level of dirt, debris & scratches. Too bad Olive doesn't have the money to affect a frame-by-frame restoration of these titles. It sure would be nice. There's also some crush (video noise) apparent, though mostly confined to the film's first reel. After that things settle down somewhat. The soundmix is level & strong. No bonus content sadly, but the film apparently wasn't important enough to warrant a large expenditure of cash to track down any living cast or crew members. I love that kind of stuff, especially for films that aren't as well known. But then I'm kinda weird that way, or so says my wife. ;-)",1451433600,6,3720,4.901587301587302

5104596,5,B007PXYXEE,"Okay, I love watching (Blu-ray, thanks folks at Olive Films) another religious-message movie featuring nearly all the beautiful movie cast children of the 1950's helping a growing blob brain from outer space put a halt to nuclear weapons in Earth orbit.  Stay in your seats for the wide-screen Bible quotation at the end.  The adorable Sandy Drescher [THEM] mentioned in an interview (Scream Queens Scream) that she did not like having to wear a bathing suit in this movie.  How innocent were the 1950s!  Just more evidence of the Hollywood Lolita Complex, but men who were about her same age at the time (me) would probably not mind.  They'll just have to turn OFF their pedometers while watching her and her little army endlessly run back and forth over and over beach boulders, some actual rock and some obviously lot plaster.  The director must have had trouble brooming away all the footprints between scenes in the beach sand.  The Brain itself seems to engorge and pulsate and glow and grow, never talking to us the audience but only to the innocent children.  We are left with many IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL Big Questions:  WIll it come back?  Was it a he or she?  How about a sequel?  Use the same kids all grown up in a sequel?  And why do the greedy rulers of Hollywood demand money-making sequels of such perfect originals?  Okay, just kidding.  My own brain is left pulsating.  My angel Sandy, wherefor art thou?

The running time suggests that it was part of a double billing with probably another S. F. movie. I saw this as a young child and don't remember the other movie.

It gives the viewer the chance to see much more than the cropped 4:3 image we've endured for years after it was shown on TV in 1986 and provided a source for gray market DVD-Rs which have been the only copies available until now.

5104616,5,B007PXYXEE,"Jack Arnold's last great 1950s b&w sci-fi desert opus. This one has children controlled by giant alien brain bringing destruction to coastal rocket site. The alien brain hides in a cave (not Bronson Canyon) and overtakes the minds of children whose parents (mostly fathers) are working on a rocket defense program. The mothers stay at home in their trailer park environment organizing weenie roasts for the children and evening get-togethers for the adults.

It's really pretty stark, the kids aren't too cute and it all measures up to Arnold's usual exceptional standards (TARANTULA, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, etc.) as this is one of those sci-fi message movies hinting at peace and global understanding (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOL STILL, THE COSMIC MAN) rather than all-out attack (EARTH VS FLYING SAUCERS, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE).

A BEAUTIFUL print from Olive Films, crisp, clear b&w photography, as though you were watching this film for the first time in a movie theater in 1958, most likely, even better. Glad to have this missing piece of Jack Arnold desert/seascape sci-fi available for viewing.

I really, really liked this release and urge all of those interested in such stuff to purchase this very exceptional release of what was considered a hard to find film.

Many found greater fame on television in succeeding years...Johnny Crawford, child actor of ""The Rifleman"" series, Jackie Coogan, Uncle Fester in ""The Addams Family"", Ty Hardin (as Ty Hungerford) in the western series ""Bronco"", Raymond Bailey, banker Drysdale in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and Russell Johnson, the Professor on ""Gilligan's Island"" in a drastic reversal of his scholarly television role.

The plot twist here is that the alien lands nears a military missile base and enlists the aid of a group of children from the housing project there to help it accomplish its purpose.  At first, it appears the alien is using mind control to manipulate the children, but as the movie advances it becomes clear it is simply communicating with them telepathically and helping them understand the dangerous path the world is headed down.  Director Jack Arnold of ""The Creature of the Black Lagoon"" and ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" fame considered this his favorite directorial effort.",1479859200,3,1400,5.136563876651983

8520889,5,B007PXYXEE,"Not bad b&w 1958 B-quality sci-fi flick with kids as the good guys who save the day. Two boys and their folks are traveling to an isolated military site so dad can help work on a nuclear warhead rocket that will save the world by destroying it.  On the way they are mentally contacted by a space brain that sets up a homebase in an out of the way cave.  All the scientists' kids from the trailer camp village become the brain's recruits.  In the end the kids and the brain save the day by destroying all the nuke super rockets all around the world.  Seems the brain wants to keep Earth safe, peaceful, and nuke-free.  The military and the adults are typically logic-blind by believing that nukes up the ying-yang and snarling at one's enemies is the way to live.  I particularly liked the trailer camp living quarters right above an isolated beach.  Seems like a peaceful way to spend a summer, except that there's no TV, no radio, no books, and one has to go MILES to the grocery store.  The film has nice eerie spacey sci-fi music and I like the astronomical still pictures.  The Olive Films DVD is excellent quality with a clear picture.  One minus is that there are no extras, not even the trailer.  Other than that highly recommended.",1467417600,,1239,4.4622222222222225
