1723017,4,B0000687L7,"I rented The Invisible Circus, thinking that I would be renting a sob-fest type of movie. Instead, I discovered a wonderful drama, during which I never cried. The movie revolves around Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) who's older sister, Faith (Cameron Diaz)commited suicide on the cliffs of a small town in Poturgal. Intent on discovering why she did this, Phoebe retraces Faith's journey through Europe, and on the way meets Faith's old boyfrend Wolf. One could say that this is a self-discovery movie. Haunted by her sister's death, Phoebe constantly thinks that she will return, but in the end learns to let go. It was nice to see Cameron do something else than the cute, ditzy blonde girl routine and I was pleasently surprised by Jordana Brewster. With breathtaking views of Paris, Berlin, and Potugal, I encourage you to rent this film.",1004400000,3,836,4.978571428571429
1723018,1,B0000687L7,"Not only is ""The Invisible Circus"" one of the most pretentious movies in recent years, it is also one of the most incompetent.  It plays like an art-house version of NBC's ""The 60s"" mini-series, which itself was very shallow.  This movie takes a variety of hippie cliches right out of ""Hair"" and mixes them in with elements of J.D. Salinger and Sylvia Plath (without the depth).  The plot is your typical troubled youth-longs-to-find-purpose-in-this-Godforsaken world.  This time, however, we have TWO troubled youths who happen to be sisters.  Cameron Diaz, who is arguably the most appealling and accomplished movie starlette of her generation, does not have a part to sink her teeth into here.  She more or less copies Robin Wright's performance from ""Forrest Gump"".  Jordana Brewster plays her younger sister who has naively worshipped Diaz since her apparant suicide in Portugal.  Neither of these characters do much other than hallucinate and mope about, all disguised as a ""looking for meaning"" trip (in every sense of the world).  Isn't it about time for a director to make a film about the 60s with three-dimensional characters and a plot we can care about?  It certainly isn't this recycled tripe!",1003968000,2,1207,5.081218274111675
1723019,2,B0000687L7,"The Invisible Circus must have looked great on paper. It's Jennifer Egan's successful and much-loved first novel adapted by proven screenwriter Adam Brooks (Practical Magic, Beloved, French Kiss). It had a promising variety of star wattage attached, including blockbuster darling Cameron Diaz, rising star Jordana Brewster, art house favorite Christopher Eccleston and the perenially excellent Blythe Danner. The drama moves from the coast of California to the streets of Paris to the cliffs of Portugal -- a potential visual feast of landscapes. And from a marketing standpoint, the story features a bit of everything -- family, rebellion, love, loss, guns, drugs, sex, world-travel, a 70s soundtrack, politcal intruige... even an old Volkswagen. A guaranteed hit, right?
Wrong. The Invisible Circus fails, and fails miserably.
The failure of this film can be blamed largely on Brewster. Her Phoebe is by turns annoying, cruel, selfish, ridiculous... you name it -- Brewster is almost unwatchable in her portrayal of a difficult character. I imagine an actress with more emotional sensitivity could have pulled it off and made the character a bit sympathetic, but Brewster fails entirely. From what I understand, she is studying at Yale... let's hope she's majoring in something other than drama.
Cameron Diaz fares better -- unlike Brewster, she's actually acting. But her character Faith is cursed by writer/director Brooks, who robs us visually and verbally of Faith's real struggle. He has the other characters inform us that Faith is upset, rather than give Diaz the chance to really portray the conflict onscreen. And so when we finally reach the point where we learn what really happened to her character, it feels like an anticlimax. Diaz tries her best, but she can't save Faith.
I'm a fan of both Christopher Eccleston and Blythe Danner, and why either of them chose to appear in this movie is a mystery to me. Eccleston, like Diaz, is given little to work with -- he's reduced to a series of broody stares at Brewster and a very bad hippie wig that makes him look older, not younger. Danner, as Phoebe and Faith's mother, is limited largely by poorly written dialogue and by the fact that all of her scenes are with Brewster.
Given the dramatic potential of the story, I think it could have been a better film in the hands of another writer/director. Though Brooks is a proven screenwriter and has even directed before (back in the 80s), whatever experience he gained in the past fails him here. He has given us the dismal Brewster in an uneven, poorly-written and emotionally lacking display of moviemaking. The Invisible Circus is a waste of time.",999475200,11,2661,5.05
1723072,3,B0000687L7,"I think ""The Invisible Circus"" was a good movie, but it could've been better.  Here are the facts:
Phoebe(Jordana Brewster) is an eighteen year old living in San Francisco in 1976 with her mother(Blythe Danner).  Her father(Patrick Bergin) died of leukemia nine years before, and her sister Faith(Cameron Diaz) killed herself six years before in Portugal.
Phoebe never got over Faith's death, so she decides to go to Europe to find out what happened to Faith during her year in Europe.  Phoebe uses the postcards Faith sent as a map, going everywhere Faith went(Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris and Portugal).
In Paris, she finds Wolf(Christopher Eccleston), Faith's ex-boyfriend.  Wolf hasn't gotten over Faith's death either, despite the fact he's about to marry another woman(Isabella Pasco).
With Wolf's help, Phoebe learns what happened to Faith and why she killed herself, and Phoebe finally moves on.
The performances were good enough, and the movie was somewhat interesting.

1723073,4,B0000687L7,"I find this film fascinating for its subtext. It begins with a San Francisco family torn apart: A father's untimely death and his eldest daughter's demise in some far off part of Europe during the politically charged 1960s.
Left behind are the mother and youngest daughter. When the daughter wants to answer the lingering questions she has about her big sib, she sets out to trace the path that her sister took, and to find out what she could about the events.
Of course, she is cautioned every step of the way, first by her mom, then by her sister's long time beau, who very reluctantly and uncomfortably begins to recount the story of their excursion across the continent and their involvement with the ""peace movement,"" and what he knew about his lover's death.
The ""Generation Gap"" I refer here is the elder ""Baby Boom"" daughter, played by Cameron Diaz, and her ""do anything"" free spirited ways, and her kid sis, portrayed in a very reserved performance by Jordana Brewster, who demonstrates how a few years can make a big difference in how you get treated. Here, seemingly trapped in her existence, she plays the part of a bird trying to find her way out of the cage she has been locked in for her life, and trying to get some answers from a world that seems intent on ""protecting"" her.
This isn't an action picture. I wouldn't even consider it a road picture, even though it takes place in Amsterdam, Paris and Portugal, beautiful locations all. But it is a psychological drama, about putting people's actions into a context, be it historical or just understandable. If you're born between the late 50s to the mid 70s, this film just might strike an important chord with you.
Wonderful performances from Diaz, Brewster, and Christopher Eccleston as the former boyfiend who plays tour guide to both Europe and his ex's final days.

1723074,3,B0000687L7,"The title is totally misleading. The 1968 revolution and its aftermath in Europe. An American girl gets involved in it but cannot either go to the end of it or assume what she puts herself into, the situation that leads to a catastrophe. But the film is definitely not fair as for what that period was. It is discovered through the eyes of a younger sister who cannot really believe it and who comes back without understanding. The film proposes no deep explanation whatsoever of this period and how young people could have believed into the necessity to change the world including with bloody violence. How could that post World War II period produce this generation of believers ? How could that generation lose faith in all human values to the extreme of killing blindly in the name of the values tbey advocated just as blindly without believing in them - really. The name of the girl, Faith, is totally ironical because she has faith in a faithless belief. The title of this film is a sham because it was no circus but a real trip beyond humanity. It could have been a good film. It is a self-satisfied vision of the present younger generation on a period we do not even try to understand. Maybe  Zabriskie Point  or  More  are more to the point on the subject. This film was done too late after the events and too superficially.

1723075,3,B0000687L7,"This movie is based upon a novel by Jennifer Egans. The main characters are Faith (Cameron Diaz) and her boyfriend Wolf.
Faith and Wolf are ebullient to go and join student protests for a better world (late 1960's) that were taking place in Europe and from there Faith writes letters to her younger sister Phoebe.
One day there's news that Faith was found dead at the bottom of a cliff somewhere in Portugalia.
Phoebe is absolutely shocked especially when she recalled that her sister had such a lively personality and it wouldn't be like her to decide on suicide. So she goes investigating for facts and soon finds herself madly in love with Wolf - her sister's boyfriend even though he's married now to another girl!

1723078,2,B0000687L7,"The Invisible Circus has probably piqued your curiosity because it really does seem like it would be a great movie.  It really COULD be a great movie, but it isn't.  Pheobe's (Jordana Brewster) sister, Faith (Cameron Diaz), goes away one summer with her boyfriend on a trip to a whole nother country, to explore, expand, and be free.  Everything was fine until the news came back that Faith had killed herself while on this trip.  Phoebe's sorrow seems to never mend, and eventually, once she turns 18, she decides to follow her sisters footsteps via the postcards that Faith sent her and try and find an answer.  While on this mission, she tracks down Faith's old boyfriend, Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), and begins questioning him as to any information that he may know concerning her sister, particularly her sister's final days.  At first reluctant, Wolf finally gives in, going against all of the promises that he made to Faith (""Promise me that no matter what, you won't tell anyone about any of this, ESPECIALLY my mom and Pheobe.""  ""Okay, I promise."").  As with any movie whose writers can't think for themselves, the inevitable happens, and both Pheobe and Wolf blatantly throw any respect they have for Faith out the window by falling victim to a romance that doesn't even really exist between the two (the on-screen chemistry between Brewster and Eccleston is barely believable, at times an insult to the viewer), as soon after, Pheobe returns home, leaving Wolf in another country after he cheated on his current lover with her.  This aspect of the movie really soured the whole for me, however, even without it, The Invisible Circus has a tendancy to turn your eyelids heavy.. you'll have a hard time being able to keep them open.  Try and hold on for a climax, a solution to everything that would make the unbearable beginning and middle parts of this movie worth it, and you'll be very disappointed.  For fans of Diaz, she does especially shine in this role, however, you'd better be a bigger fan of Brewster, as she is the main character in this film, and there aren't as many scenes with Diaz as you are led to believe.  This movie is definitely nothing to worry about missing.",1032652800,3,2194,4.759894459102902

1723080,2,B0000687L7,"Though Cameron Diaz's name will attract you, it is actually Jordana Brewster (""The Fast and the Furious"") who leads the story -- and that story itself is a good one.  A young girl Phoebe (Brewster) learns that her elder sister Faith (Diaz), whom she adored and even idolized, killed herself in Portugal after she left her family to go to Europe.  To seek for the truth behind her death, Phoebe too decides to follow her sister's path with ""Wolf,"" Faith's ex-boyfriend.  What will Phoebe see in the end?
This touching story is accompanied with good music and cinematography.  The picturesque location in Portugal and France is breathtakingly beautiful, and we have supporting cast including Blythe Danner (""Meet the Parents"") and even Moritz Bleibtreu (Mani of ""Run Lola Run"").
However, the director handles each character in a very wrong way.  As we are not given enough clues to relate to any of them, we do not just understand why Faith has to devote herself to radical political movements; we do not just know why Phoebe falls in love with ""Wolf"" (Eccleston) so suddenly; or most of all, why Phoebe has to chase her sister's image so desperately.  In one scene in Paris Brewster""s Phoebe sees her sister's vision on a door, and Phoebe, as if haunted by the vision, slams into the panel on which she thinks she sees her sister beckoning her to ""push.""  Probably the director intended to express Phoebe's state of mind, but we audience are simply left wondering what is going on.  Jordana Brewster, usually a good actor, is not particularly to blame, I think; rather, it seems as if she herself is at a loss how to act.
As a whole, ""Invisible Circus' is a watchable film.  Its acting is, if not memorable, not so bad, but Diaz and Eccleston sometimes look very uncomfortable in their 70 fashion.  Major stars' participation in a small film is always welcome, but in this case, I just regret the lost opportunity.",1009584000,4,1913,4.734939759036145

7963927,4,B0000687L7,"Some people don't like this film, since it doesn't fill in all the blanks for them, or simply because they don't like the 60's.

That's too bad, because in it's own way it's a little gem. I for one don't need my feelings and thoughts dictated to me, in the way that many 'popcorn' movies do. A way that many people have gotten used to it seems, and that made them lazy. And as for the 60's, this film is certainly not without its (implicit) criticism about the era...

This film challenges you to think for yourself, and make up your own mind. In my book that's a good thing.

We see how Faith gets overwhelmed by her fathers projections: in his view she's born in the right age to change things - unlike himself, a wannabe painter who's stuck in an office job. Faith and Phoebe believe that's what brought him to an early grave, and Faith sets out to fulfill her fathers dreams, which have now become her own.

Always looking for more, pushing further and further, Faith crosses the line  and ventures into violent and extremist circles. Too late she realizes she went too far, and there's no way back - at least in her mind.

One of many thing that this film shows 'between the lines' is how easy it is to stray too far, and how hard it is to take one step back after you've crossed a certain line. And I'm not (just) talking about the ending of the film. It's clear to see how estranged Faith is from her old hippie friends after she comes back from the extremist RAF circles. She's still on an adrenaline buzz when she comes back, thinking the extremists were the real deal and oh so very exiting, whilst she perceives her old friends as 'boring' and merely 'wasting their time with slogans and banners'. Misguided as she is, she sees the terrorists as the only ones who are really making a difference. She can't relate to her friends anymore, and that's one more reason why it all went so horribly wrong...

The younger sister Phoebe sets out to follow Faith's footsteps, be it just to find out how it could have been possible that her happy, fun loving sister suddenly committed suicide.

It's a 'coming of age' drama in a way, but in a sense that we all have to find our own way, not follow blindly in the footsteps of others. It also makes a point that violence is never the answer. The only way to ever really change things is by setting a positive example, reach out to others, and keep on struggling to find our own truth.",1195344000,,2433,4.355408388520972
7963928,5,B0000687L7,"It is 1969. Phoebe(Camilla Belle) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister Faith(Cameron Diaz). Faith is the doer, the truth-seeker, the fixer of all the wrongs in the world. Then one day, Phoebe and her mother Gail(Blythe Danner) receive word that Faith is dead. Faith has killed herself. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, Gail mourns. Phoebe can't let it go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened.

It is now 1977. Phoebe(Jordana Brewster) is 18 and decides to go to Europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth. When alive, Faith was inseparable from a man she called ""Wolf""(Christopher Eccleston). Though Wolf claimed not to know anything about Faith's last days, Phoebe convinces him to tell her everything. Within days, Wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins Phoebe on her pilgrimage to Portugal.

In the end, Wolf is able to tell of Faith's decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide. Although angry, Phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile Faith really was.

I liked this movie. I'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the Red Army and I was 10 in 1969. This story was familiar ground for me. I can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to Canada or not to avoid the draft.

The story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that period. Camilla Belle was perky, enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster slid easily into the role of the older Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the ever supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on American TV, unfortunately. I would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with.

Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. Though at times, her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel. Watching her dance on the wall, kind of made me cringe.

Of all the characters, it was Christopher Eccleston's Wolf, that made the most growth. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he is a worldly man. He is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices. In the end, he realizes the direction he and Faith are headed is wrong and begins to ""grow up"" deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. Eccleston's Wolf is the most real of all the characters.

For most of us, our idealism either dies or we adjust and conquer through other ways.  This is what the Wolf character did.",1164844800,9,2740,4.554878048780488

It lacks, for one thing, that amber-colored lens that so many filmmakers use, the one that colors the world in bright jewel tones and lush greens. It lacks Spielberg-esque background music telling you how to feel. It lacks glamour, fairy tales and phoniness.
Phoebe goes to Europe to track Faith's footsteps. There is no aerial view of the Eiffel Tower with accordions playing La Vie En Rose. There are no cutesy Europeans plying her with their wares, no breathtaking, overphotographed landmarks. She is alone in the dingy, drab, real colors of the real Europe. She finds out that Faith wasn't what she thought. She finds out that she, Phoebe, is OK after all. Not an atom-splitting moment; just an everyday kind of epiphany, wrenching nonetheless.
Diaz is at her best here - she proves that she's a real actress and not just a popular blonde.
Pay attention to the ending, if you didn't the first time. It's like a period at the end of a sentence.
