Such a talent, yet the color or his skin cost him dearly Tatum's longtime friendship with the late Marques Haynes was quite evident. And Haynes' appearance with Tatum's son at the so-deserved Hall of Fame induction of Goose was touching. A story of Goose Tatum that was long overdue. Kudos to ESPN for making it happen!",1436054400,,429,4.972222222222222

This film isn't all fun and games though. It's a trip down a road that many want to travel but few have the heart to.  It might be a heartbreaking tribute to a great performer and human being.  #30for30 #film #documentary #hoop",1413072000,5,402,4.378378378378378
