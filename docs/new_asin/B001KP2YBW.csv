Such a disappointment and total loss for all of us who enjoyed the genuine artists creation. Just another example of businesses mainstreaming art to fit the general public.",1434585600,,319,5.2745098039215685

8315745,5,B001KP2YBW,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) take notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1278720000,4,977,4.588571428571429
