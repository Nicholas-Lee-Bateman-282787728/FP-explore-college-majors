6867764,3,B00QHCKHHQ,"*Minor Spoiler Alert* I ended up finding this movie while I was browsing on Amazon, since I am always looking for new ""found footage"" horror movies. I bought it instead of renting it since it was only $3.00 more. Digging Up The Marrow wasn't a bad movie. It starts off slow with interviews and I tend to get bored with all the interviews that a lot of ""found footage"" movies have. I think they made the right pick with picking Ray Wise to be William Dekker, because he is a great actor. I think this movie had alot of potential and would of easily been five stars if they would of focused more on the Marrow and possibly going inside and looking for what was apparently Dekker's son. The monsters, affects, and drawings were great. I just wish they would of not done interviews for so long with various people and the film crew just explore The Marrow, with possibly no escape.",1424736000,8,877,4.419753086419753
6867765,3,B00QHCKHHQ,So if you don't know who Adam Green is you will soon find out as every scene in this movie has him wearing a shirt from a different project he has worked on - written/directed.  This movie was a cool concept but just spent way too much time exploring Adam Green's personal life and far too little time on the matter at hand - The Marrow.  Not a bad film but just felt a little drawn out for the ubiquitous punch line.,1424649600,3,417,4.073170731707317

Got to catch the screening in LA last night and got to really understand how much deep thinking actually went into this burrow.  Together they made an insane, abyss of horror-filled excitement that you'll find yourself looking into while seeing this. This movie will stick with you for a long time. Great use of concepts and leaves you thinking. Great job and great film. Also it is extremely scary. The Marrow is real.

This movie does not have a traditional horror plot, it really does feel like found video constructed with a beginning and a
 creepy resolution. The makeup effects were amazing and a little over the top, reminding me of 80's/90's horror or a comic book. The acting was good but the special effects are the best part of the movie.

6867784,4,B00QHCKHHQ,"DIGGING UP THE MARROW is probably one of the more misunderstood, underappreciated genre films of recent years. A lot of that fault belongs to Image Entertainment in misrepresenting the film with quotes like "" 'The scariest movie of the past two decades'--UK Horror Scene."" That quote built viewer expectations in the wrong direction, setting it up for a fall. Had Image been a little more honest and compared it to THIS IS SPINAL TAP or simply described it as a parody of TV paranormal documentary programs, DIGGING UP THE MARROW would probably have a better reputation.

Director Adam Green and cinematographer Will Barratt play themselves. Ray Wise plays a crusty old crackpot--or is he?--named William Dekker. Dekker approaches Green with the idea of filming a documentary about a community of severely deformed humans (or creatures) who live in an underground civilization called The Marrow.

A big monster fan himself, Green swallows Dekker's tale with great enthusiasm, even when There is good reason to doubt Dekker's claims. Dekker imposes restrictions on their filming that make it difficult to catch any footage of the creatures. Eventually they do get a shot of one of The Marrow dwellers and the movie shifts gears. It starts becoming a bit darker. Wise's performance also masterfully alternates between quirky-funny and disturbing. The last shot of Wise reminded me just how powerful an actor he truly is.

The film is a little bit slow through the middle of the film. For those with patience, there is still a bit of fun on the journey as everybody from Adam Green's colleagues to his wife try to convince him just how dumb it is that he believes Dekker's claims. For Green that is just the point. Like Fox Mulder, Green simply WANTS to believe. Successfully filming these creatures would validate a life-long interest in monsters. The dialog is very witty at times, but still retains a feeling of unscripted spontaneity. There are also a few nice cameos along the way.

The conclusion is ultimately satisfying. Probably a better payoff than I've seen on some of the ""true"" paranormal programs this film sends up. Some creatures are shown, but not so much as to overstay their welcome. For those who want to see the creatures more, there is an excellent extra detailing the process of translating Alex Pardee's moody creature designs into some amazing sculptures.

I am not well versed enough in all of the technical aspects of DVD mastering to comment on it in an informed way. I will say the presentation is really good. Contrast and color  are generally excellent, even if some of the night scenes seem a little too dark. However, I that that may have been intentional.

If prepared for what this film actually offers versus how Image misrepresented it, I think you'll have a good time with DIGGING UP THE MARROW.",1484697600,3,2830,4.920335429769392

odd note:
ray wise was great in this, essentially a one-man play for a quarter of the movie, but we did not see him eat, so that was a plus; but the people from that dinner table scene later incessantly interrupted ray while he was trying to speak, which doesnt surprise me as one can learn a lot from how people, and it pains me to use this word in relation to the movie, ""dine"".",1483142400,,958,4.662721893491124

6867790,4,B00QHCKHHQ,"For being a lower budget horror movie in the quasi found footage variety, this has enough interesting ideas to make it worth watching, even if things are not satisfyingly wrapped up in the movie. People have complained there is too much plugging of the director's other work since he's playing himself, but it didn't come across as any more intrusive than any other fictional portrayal of a real person who is promoting their business in a film... devoted to their business. It's a mockumentary, so it makes sense that he would be hinging on his role as an established horror director and use his real staff as well. The performances are good, it only suffers a little of that 'wait, why would they do this?' that you usually get in contrived horror movies, and it's worth the buy just for Ray Wise's performance and the extras on the Blu-ray that include a pretty nifty making of the monsters documentary. That the story is decent, has a lot of interesting threads woven into it, and is worth watching at least twice is just icing on the cake. I'm not a horror junky, this thing only has a few moments of actual creature effects in it, but it's worth your money.",1474848000,4,1163,4.569377990430622

Synopsis: A documentary filmmaker (writer/director Adam Green) turns his lens on an enigmatic conspiracy theorist (Ray Wise), who claims he's found the entrance to a vast underground city populated entirely by monsters. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi.

6867799,4,B00QHCKHHQ,"DIGGING UP THE MARROW has a simple, and for he most part, effective premise. In it, horror Director / monstrer-nerd-extraordinaire, Adam Green (FROZEN, HATCHET 1-3) plays himself. Green is approached by a strange man named William Dekker (Ray Wise- ROBOCOP, DEAD END, THE AGGRESSION SCALE), who claims to not only have evidence of the existence of real monsters, but to also know where to find them. Green is intrigued enough by Dekker's story to enlist his cameraman (Alex Pardee), and follow Dekker into what could very well be the fantasy of a madman. MARROW contains a few, spooky surprises, but is mainy a comedic look at Green's horror obsession, using a ""found footage"" / documentary-style approach. Thankfully, Green is better at this type of film than most, and his encounters w/ real-life horror icons like Mick Garris, Kane Hodder, Lloyd Kaufman, etc., at horror conventions, and in his studio, helps to keep things entertaining. Green himself is obviously having a great time, and his antics add to the movie's fun-factor. I did like the monsters, though, as a monster maniac myself, I only wish they'd had more screen time!

6867813,4,B00QHCKHHQ,"I'm not sure how he does it, but he does. Adam Green's latest outing, Digging Up The Marrow, shows that he can succeed where most would fail. The film, in theory, should not have worked. A ""found footage"" movie about monsters living under the Earth's surface sounds like a SyFy special and as Kane Hodder says ""found footage, that's never been done before"". But its not a ""found footage"" film, instead it's a fakeumentary and presented in such a way that you can't help yourself from believing in it.

The film is shot in perfect documentary form and opens up just like many of the documentaries that are out there. You have the quick montage of interviews at conventions all dealing with the topic of monsters and then you're tossed into the main story. Adam plays a more amped up version of himself while Will Barratt plays the role of the friend who is forced into a situation that he has no desire to be in. The two travel to meet William Dekker (Ray Wise) because he has sent Adam notebooks filled with notes and drawings of real monsters that live in a place he calls The Marrow. From there on out it is a hunt to find and capture on film these real life monsters.

Ray Wise is the only person in the film to play a character. From the moment he starts ranting about The Marrow you instantly believe he is William Dekker and not Ray Wise playing Dekker. Wise brings to the screen a sense of truth and range that only a seasoned actor like Wise can bring. The way he stares into the camera with a deadpan look on his face really puts you in a mindset that this guy has seen some s***. Having Wise play this character is hands down the best decision made for the film, because the performance he brings is award worthy.

Will Barratt pulls double duty in the film. Not only is he the cinematographer, but he is the third lead. Barratt is behind the camera most of the time, but you can always hear him talking and he delivers some pretty funny lines. I'm not sure what to give him the most credit for - his cinematography or his acting- because they are both exceptionally well done. Barratt made the most out of his single camera and he really worked it to his advantage.

Adam is playing a caricature of himself, but at the other end of the spectrum compared to his Adam from Holliston. He is more concerned with spending Will's money and proving the existence of monsters than anything else (there is a great line about spending all of his money on the project). Adam's comedic timing is on point and the back and forth between him and Barratt make for some funny situational humor. Also the sarcastic looks given to the camera just nail the tone of each scene........(What's tone?)

The creatures are limited with their screen time, but when they appear they own the film. I have no clue how they did it, but these were some of the best and original monsters I have seen in a long time. And you know it's a fake documentary yet you can't help getting hit with the jump scare when the monster rear their heads. Not only did I jump, but I jumped twice. That right there should attest to the monsters' awesomeness and the films ability to draw you in.

The movie really works in a way that I could have never imagined and Green deserves a huge round of applause for taking something old and making it new again. Yet I do have one gripe with the film and that's the ending. The film has so much steam moving forward to that final act, but somehow it loses a bit when it comes to the climax. Just when you think everything is going to play out and get explained your left with a weird awkward ending. Wise's character feels abandoned and left incomplete with no real resolution, but there is a silver lining in the last scene that I can't mention, because it would spoil the fun.

There was so much material to work with in this movie. There was so much that could have been done with this movie and it sees like Adam wasted it.  On top of that, he played the most obnoxious of characters.  He was such a horror film clich&eacute;.  He was rude, he was disrespectful, and he was just overall unpleasant.  More than once I hoped one of the monsters would take him out.  That's the character clich&eacute; he plays - The obnoxious guy you are actually praying for to get killed.  This movie would have been better off written and directed by someone like Clive Barker - the concept bears some similarities to ""Nightbreed"" - or someone like Guillermo del Toro - his films ""Hellboy II: the Golden Army"" and his film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" feature an underground society with strange creatures. The ending was also disappointing.  Sometimes an ambiguous ending is good for a horror film, but in this case it failed.  This movie explained so little and left so many questions unanswered.

His latest, (Digging Up the Marrow) maybe his most interesting film yet, but because of the budget probably not his best...

The film is made with a pseudo-realism, being about the director ""Adam Green"" who gets word that there is a crazy guy (Ray Wise) who believes that monsters are real and can prove it, and not being able to resist, director ""Adam Green"" and he's crew begins doing a documentary on the crazy guy in hopes that, albeit unlikely, could lead to actual proof that monsters exist.

The film overall is pretty good, being well written and acted, having a mixture of ""doc"" style as well as ""found footage."" Despite this, the main hangup I have with the film is at the end of the day it's a MONSTER flick and the monsters are...well...let me explain...director Adam Green, in a smart move chooses to only show the monsters for brief moments at a time. This works perfectly with the pseudo doc style, but because of that you can't really see them long enough to truly take them in, especially if you stream this movie. If you stream it you probably won't bother to rewind or look the shots  of the monsters over frame by frame like you would if you actually have the bluray, which I do. Having the bluray you can pause and look at the detail, and can tell that a lot of time an effort went into the monsters which you can't really tell just watching them in real-time in the film. When watching them in real time some of the monsters look down right laughable, and some still look not so great even when you go frame by frame.
With the indie budget they probably did the best job they could, but to really do this kind of monster film justice you really need more than an indie budget can provide.

With that being said the film is still well made, and a much needed breath of fresh air in the genre. The blueray also has a few good extras about the production and origins of the story with all of the players involved, but the standout special feature is the audio commentary that Adam Green always provides for his films which features the director himself, and actor Ray Wise, artist Alex Pardee, and DP Will Baratt. It is very informative and entertaining, as well, being mostly dominated by the directer, himself, with the highlights being actor Ray Wise being quick on his feet, turning something very sad into a laugh out loud moment, and also, a very personal confession by the director himself that, if you're a die-hard horror fan, you were completely unaware of and feels shocking when you hear it, feeling as though at any moment he will tell you he's just joking, but sadly, he doesn't.

This is a good movie, but leaves you with the feeling that if they make a sequel you hope that somehow it gets the budget it deserves to really flesh-out a story like this!",1440288000,,3008,4.461818181818182

6867841,2,B00QHCKHHQ,"While I thoroughly enjoyed myself for a good duration of the movie, it was overall rather disappointing due to the fact that FAR too much time is spent on the dialogue between Adam Green and Ray Wise and not near enough on the creatures and their world, The Marrow. The monster effects are awesome, BUT, there's only ONE legitimate scene of mayhem and that ONLY lasts about five minutes long.

The ending is also way too abrupt and leaves a ton of story arcs completely left hanging with none of the characters even attempting to address them.

This movie had a ton of potential, but it's nearly all talk, no walk. In film, you're supposed to show, not tell. One scene in particular was completely unnecessary as NOTHING comes of it. During said scene, the filmmakers fly to Boston to find out if their subject was a police officer. This five-to-ten-minute segment brings no new information to the table and the content it hints at is NOT ADDRESSED afterward. It should've just been a deleted scene.

Digging Up the Marrow constantly talks about the monsters and their underworld, but doesn't actually delve into it. I and the group that were watching it thought that the ending would culminate in the hybrids' world of the Marrow, but it ends on a completely typical and uninspired found-footage note in just Adam Green's house.",1433376000,,1329,4.744588744588745

Touting the designs of a talented illustrator for its creatures, which are wonderfully imaginative, and with an actual successful execution, you will be disappointed in that after the elaborate and decent set up, the payoff is woefully underwhelming.

6867876,2,B00QHCKHHQ,"Adam Green who has given us ""Hatchet"" which I praised and ""Frozen"" which was a bore, brings us a semi-documentary style film as his late entry into the hand held genre craze. Yes, even during the disco era, most respected rockers broke down and did a disco song.

In this feature, Adam Green played himself. He is contacted by retired detective William Dekker (Ray Wise) about a group of ""monsters"" or deformed humans who live underground in what he calls ""The Marrow."" They travel around with a camera getting a lot of pictures of nothing and then like all hand held genre films, things pick up in the last few minutes.

The monster make-up was excellent, however Adam Green in front of the camera was not. In fact most of the horror film crowd who played themselves in front of the camera were a yawn including Kane Hodder without a hockey mask.

Everyone else acted like they were reading their lines and maybe they were. I also wish there had been more focus on the Marrow and the creatures, because although it did sound a bit like Nightbreed, it had a couple of original ideas that they just threw away. It was more like the film was an ego trip for the filmmakers than a story. Do we really care about their personal lives? No. We want to learn more about Dekker and what's happening/or maybe isn't happening out there in the woods.

I would recommend this be shown to aspiring actors so they can see for themselves how a good actor can make the worst writing work. Ray Wise stole every scene he was in.",1428192000,2,962,4.404494382022472

For example: the crew wants to use lights to film their subjects but their source tells them the lights would scare them away. A night vision camera is the obvious solution but the ""professional"" camera man insists it just makes things look ""green like in a sex tape"". What the hell? And then, to prove it, he shows the exact same camera they've been using with a green gobo over the lens. Ridiculous. And that's just one of MANY.

And let's not forget to mention the constant product placement of brand spanking new shirts everyone wears emblazoned with the logos of films this guy has done before making the whole thing feel like a excruciating three hour commercial or that, of the only two female characters, one  spends her total of three scenes in a bathing suit, lingerie and then nothing but panties.

It has funny and creepy bits, and manages to get a bit scarier as it goes along.  The movie is not quite successful at pulling off a realistic feel to the documentary aspect though, and sort of alternated between campy comedy and attempted realism.  Adam Green was good, but didn't quite nail the character.  All in all, it's a bit confused, but interesting and well put together.

The movie definitely has a creep factor as you near the end and I didn't want to take my eyes off of the screen.

6867903,4,B00QHCKHHQ,"Digging Up The Marrow was much more fun than I had anticipated. Adam Green is hilarious as himself in what is basically a mockumentary about a strange man William Dekker played to perfection by veteran actor(Ray Wise) .Dekker claims to know of an underground world of Monsters called ""The Marrow"" that he has been keeping tabs on for years.

Everyone from Green's wife to Victor Crowley himself (Kane Hodder) make appearances in the film as themselves as well. I found it to be quite clever and fresh,but  was surprised that there was no gore seeing as it was an Adam Green film. Dekker enlists Green to document his findings but has very ridged and paranoid rules attached to the project.

It took quite awhile to get through the silly stuff to the horror aspect of the film. When it did it was quite chilling and left an quite an impression on me. I enjoyed this film very much.

It actually had a scare or two also, the cheap kind, but still... :) Mentioned in this show was some of Adam Green's other stuff, I immediately went looking for more information on those, I was really disappointed in what I saw, the series that he has was not for me. The humor and writing, the acting, all was pretty bad, too bad too, because I liked his acting in ""Marrow"", he seemed 'real' to me, and the writing was pretty good, as was the acting.

Add some quirky music between scenes and some pretty bad acting by Green the rest of the cast, you have a okay film at best. I truly felt  that I had just watched something that felt like a cross between a found footage film and Nightbreed.  I also have to say that I was not very happy with the ending.

There ARE good scares and thrills, but if a long sustained adrenaline rush is what you need, better to check out something like The Butcher Boys, Daylight, Hills Have Eyes. But this one will please you especially if you enjoy well told stories and novel approaches to the horror genre. What's so novel? For one thing, the way that director and writer Adam Green brings life to the found footage genre by putting himself in the movie, as himself, obsessed with following up on the claims of one William Decker (Ray Wise, who knocks it out of the park here in the meatiest role I've seen him play since Twin Peaks). Green keeps the movie from being a vanity project by making himself a comic foil. The story is full of the sort of delightful slice-of-life banter and low-key comedy that you'd get in a Robert Altman film, and there is also a very rewarding, well orchestrated build of suspense that really pays off. I enjoyed it very much; it's the first Adam Green film I've seen, though I'm certainly aware of him, and am definitely looking forward to seeing his other horror films like Hatchet and Frozen (no, not THAT Frozen).
Some other movies that are like this in that they give an interesting glimpse into the real world of the creators of independent horror are Silver Bullets and S&Man; if you like this you should check those out, too, because they're quite good.",1426550400,,1397,4.592

The mockumentary aspect of this movie works exceedingly well as its plausible and the reason behind its high quality works, as the people making it are real filmmakers. The acting is great, very natural, Ray Wise in particular does a monumental job. The direction is incredibly engaging and there is never a slump in the pace. As for the story, I see inspiration from Nightbreed but this is anything but a rip-off. The story is fresh, intriguing, and in my own little horror wrapped mind, realistic. And I think thats what he was going for. To give horror fans what they always wanted, proof of monsters. The movie is definitely satirical and many funny moments, but also manages to pull out the creep factor here and there.

6867949,5,B00QHCKHHQ,"Okit scared me!

Ive been putting off watching this movie ever since it came out on Amazon.  The reviews kept putting me off; so, I felt embarrassed to even consider watching it.  But I kept running into it in my searches for other movies and then I gave in my kid who loved watching cheesy sci-fi/horror movies at night and paid the outlandish price with the same humiliating feeling I got when I bought a Pet Rock back in the 70s.

I don't know what it was that made me love this movie but I did.  Maybe I watched it at just the right time, with the wind blowing hard outside and the damn dogs barking in the alley for no damn reason; and the moonlight trying to penetrate the dark clouds that covered the evening.  Perhaps, if I had watched this movie any other day, I would have been pissed off demanding my money back.  But tonight I liked it.  I really liked it!  There were a few moments when (despite being desensitized by watching way too many horror flicks) this movie actually scared me.  And the first time it did scare me, I found myself feeling anxious and at the edge of my couch for the rest of the movie.  I really got hooked by the premise of where monsters might really come from; and I thought, Okay, thats one I never heard of before.  For me a good horror movie has to have a ring of possibility to iteven a minute ring off the toll bell.

So, with that slight foundation it captured my imagination and there I became the storys bitch.  And I allowed it to hold my breath, to quickly look behind me when a noise caught me by surprise outside, and to nervously wonder what the freak are the dogs barking at?  Yeah, it scared me and I loved it!  No it wasn't the special effects (though I liked the fact that it wasn't computer generated) and there was no tension building music that usually comes along to warn you something evil is coming this way.  The story just made itself at home in my head and played with my imagination.  I won't reveal anything about the movie nor try to convince you to watch ityoull probably hate it anyway.

6867951,4,B00QHCKHHQ,"**NO SPOILERS**  First, thank you for giving me a moment of your time, I'll try not to waste it. I bypassed this one a million times because of the cheesy creature DVD artwork. It appears to have all the makings of a very bad, stereotypical b- or c-movie with yet another lame CHUD-like/Troma/foam-latex/Halloween-shop creature.

Frankly, having bypassed it so many times, it wore me down, and last night I rented it. OK, so where to start, as this review is going to take some explaining...

First off, if you're a seriously hardcore horror fan (esp of Adam Green's excellent work), this is actually part documentary (it's part of the film, the ""real"" Hollywood horror insider scene) and you might enjoy that aspect. Second, this one's not like any horror film I've seem before, for better or worse, it's novel. It's not quite ""found footage"" but it is shot in a first-person format using all manner of cameras, angles, etc.

Third, this movie is a practical special effects horror movie fan's dream. I think even fans of the SyFy Channel's Face Off might enjoy seeing practical special effects in an actual recent-release. Personally, I am a big fan of practical effects, especially with CGI's ongoing replacement of ""things"" guys like Tom Savini, etc., used to do by hand. There's something about these effects that CGI just can't replicate, and it's good to see it still not only has a home, but can be a key element in a modern horror film.

Digging Up the Marrow is a fairly slow film, from start to finish, so you have to accept that pacing - and, for me, it works. In fact, this film could not have worked without the hurdles and obstacles of all kinds, esp the real world's demands on Green's time for his very real Hollywood projects.

This quasi-doco horror film examines the idea that a very real world of monsters exists, and has existed literally beneath our own. What came to mind, for me, was a world like the Troll Market from Hellboy 2.

Whether or not it does, or if it's all one man's delusion... well, THAT is the question this very fun, unique, and exceptionally well made (shot/edited/sound, etc.) proposes to answer. I don't want to say more, as I promised no spoilers. So, I hope I've set the stage enough that you, like me, can see past the DVD artwork and make a more informed choice as to whether this one's worth your time and a small amount of money....

If you're a jaded horror fan, looking for something new, I think you'll find this experience was worth it.

Personally, I think this film, as many others have noted, could have been SO much more. It was like it set the stage really, really well, but the show itself stopped right as it was getting interesting.",1425600000,35,2695,4.609603340292275

Here u have that but then u have this story about deformed ppl in this world that start left humanity and created a metropolis under ground. This film is not creepy, scary, gory, nothing

6867953,3,B00QHCKHHQ,"I had very high hopes for this movie, I mean the premise of the story alone is original and engaging. This movie when I first saw the trailer just screamed the possibility of horror gold. But being the diehard horror fan that I am, this also caused me to really doubt that it would be. Many times, and Im sure those who frequent horror movies as I do, know that many times. Especially within the Horror Genre, movies that could have been great, look like they would be great, frequently fall flat.
Now I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie fell flat, it was still entertaining and definitely had some creepy moments. The special effects were top notch in most places. And the approach of the Docudrama/ found footage was nice. As well as for the most part the acting was solid.
The biggest issue with this film is how slow it is, we spend 70% of the movie, wondering if Mr. Detective is a nut job, and the protagonists are being strung along on a wild goose chase. I could have forgiven this is it delivered solid in the end but it didnt.
Also, when we get to the part where they have been flat out discovered by the ""Marrow Dwellers"" if you will, when Mr. Bag Head reveals himself. This actually ruined the creep and horror factor for me. (Minor spoiler alert coming up). There is a point where it is obvious that the Marrow Dwellers have discovered our protagonists, and we see this crazy, and unsettling little critter like a footed head go wailing by. Then the light shows on a very tall, creepy ass creature, which the special effects were absolutely awesome. But then as I mentioned above once they jump in the vehicle, and bag boy reveals himself, full on in the headlights. What the director intended to enhance the scares, in my opinion actually killed it. It was just too much of a reveal and the creepy creature we just see a glimpse of just before bag head, was much better done and way more scary.
There are many others things that I could say that I liked and didn't like. Overall it is an interesting, and creepy little film. But it just ended up not living up to what it could have been. This story idea could be done so much better. When I got to the end of the film I found myself thinking, ""Please revisit this and do it better!""
Sadly, Im quite a bit disappointed, but I do hope that the creators have another pow wow and take a better stab at it! Overall this is a solidly 3 star movie, worth watching, but sadly, could have been so much more!",1425340800,,2473,4.320430107526882

I don't know if everyone else saw a different movie than I did but it was one of the few times when I not only say ""Thats an hour and a half of my life Im never getting back"" but also ""That is 7.00 of my hard working money Im never getting back"" I, on routine, watch horror movies and not all of them are good, I accept that but this went beyond bad. Most of the movie was Adam Green joking around and self promoting, thats when he is not trying to give his wife a guilt trip. When it finally got to, I guess what you could call the point of the movie, it was ridiculous. First the monsters were not actually monsters but children that have deformities who ran aways to live under ground like ""normal"" people, work, marriage, divorce. Then they turned into really ""scary"" monsters who just looked like a 10 year old did their make up. Im still not sure what was happening with the ""openings"" to the Marrow but I will admit I fell asleep through most of it. I  have insomnia and the one good things I can say about this movie is it very well may be the nonprescription treatment for sleep issues!  This is my basic description weak story line absolutely juvenile looking monster's ( I could have done better makeup than that) and one of the worst docudramas I have ever seen!

6867958,3,B00QHCKHHQ,"***SPOILERS AHEAD***

This is a modern day NIGHTBREED (Clive Barker).  I admire the concept of this movie, and it's got some really great characters along with Adam Green himself and other cast members as themselves questioning the obsession Adam has in believing/finding monsters, and there actually being this hidden underverse of monstrosities beneath our feet.  The actors and characters themselves made this movie: great interactions and sharp balance between funny and freaky.  It's also an upgrade in the sense that it doesn't rely on objective unexplainable forces that power the creatures, but rather they are deformities that have reproduced and capitalized on their evolutionary, genetic ""mutations"".  I will be honest, the main reason(s) I don't want to give this film five stars is because it's just not scary and I have no idea what genre it is.  It has some creepy elements and the creatures concepts are great, but I didn't find it scary.  I honestly wanted to learn more of the backstory of the creatures themselves and wanted to see more of them than Adam Green's plight for others in believing him.  So thumbs up on creativity, thumbs severed on execution.",1425081600,2,1175,5.083333333333333

6867960,1,B00QHCKHHQ,"Terrible movie.  You sit and wait for something to happen, and it never does.  What's even worse, is when you watch the trailer, those are the only scenes in the movie that are even remotely scary.  Not worth the time.",1425081600,4,218,4.4

6867963,2,B00QHCKHHQ,"The monsters in this ""mockumentary"" are nifty, but you have to wade through a lot of filler to get to them. These portions will only be of interest almost exclusively to diehard fans of director Adam Green, who stars as himself. Green seems like a good geek so I don't want to ride him too much, but his acting inexperience definitely sticks out when he tries to go toe-to-to with the great, character actor Ray Wise. Overall, a noble effort to break the found footage mold that ultimately falls prey to the same trappings and deficiencies.",1425081600,,540,4.635416666666667

Adam Green also stars in this flick and I gotta say he's better sued behind the camera. The monsters are almost cool, but they aren't in it enough and when they are, they barely do anything. In short don't pay money to see this film!

Could they have gone a different direction in some key scenes, yes...but who cares.  It is a movie and it was entertaining!  Also, the movie stuck with me a couple of days after watching it.  Ray Wise was excellent in the movie.  You want to believe his character at times and then you hope he is just nuts because he gets a little creepy at times also.  Great cameos from the horror community especially Kane Hodder!  I will be buying this on Blu-ray.  Great job Adam!!!",1424736000,15,739,4.207142857142857

Unprofessional videotape shot at breakneck speed to hurry it up and get to punch lines. Everything is exaggerated and poorly done. Story is silly and primus is ludicrous.

Great story. Something very different.,1516579200,,408,4.927536231884058

It was very entertaining, but be warned that there is a lot of dialogue and suspense, but not a lot of monster showing. The monsters that were shown seem to be practical effects rather than CGI, which was nice. The movie is a documentary style with a bit of mystery, and I wish there had been more explanation about the ending. Way ching this reminded me of Troll Hunter, another fake documentary movie, but I personally think Troll Hunter is better.",1506556800,,517,4.51063829787234

8691298,5,B00QHCKHHQ,"Liked this movie ... and I'm a major cynic.  I hate most movies.  Three college degrees have made me a snob.  Or maybe just age has done it.  Anyhow, I loved this movie.  This is one of the few ""we're making documentary"" movies to actually pull it off.  The actor that plays William Deckor is great.  He makes the movie.

This movie has a great STORY!!  It's the kind of story to tell around a campfire.  Movie makers need to go back to basics, and this one does.  A movie with crappy special effects, but a great story, will still get a good review.  If you don't believe me, ask yourself why it was the old ""Dr. Who"" shows were so liked.  They had the worst special effects ever.  Yet, with excellent special effects, but no story, will still get a crappy review.

Why did I give this movie five stars?  You might ask how I could give this movie five stars ... how could I put it up there with all time great movies.  Simple ... I consider the category.  It's hard to make a good horror movie ... plain and simple.  It's a difficult thing to do.  And to make a ""Found Footage"" or ""Documentary Horror"" that is any good, is even harder.

I've rated hundreds of them, and have given most of them, except ""Troll Hunter"" one star.  This movie pulled it off nicely, in my opinion.

Incidentally, the ""Hatchet Movies"" were stupid, in my opinion.  This one was great.  Story.  It's all about the story.",1503878400,,1396,4.293436293436294
