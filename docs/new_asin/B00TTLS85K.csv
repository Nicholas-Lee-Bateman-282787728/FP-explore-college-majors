8703057,1,B00TTLS85K,"Worst movie of 2015. Not bad good but just bad horrible. Worst acting and sound quality of the year. Absolutely no story to speak or write of. I own a mom and pop video shop and I really hate bashing passion projects but this is atrocious. It's like a PG-13 borenanza. I get it, Bikinis is in the title but the funniest part is how they treat it like its an R rated late night soft core porn on Cinemax. But with no sex and no nudity. All these slow seductive shots of girls in bikinis over lousy cheesy music. Oh man I'm so mad at myself for buying this and wasting my life watching complete garbage.",1446940800,,601,4.145299145299146
