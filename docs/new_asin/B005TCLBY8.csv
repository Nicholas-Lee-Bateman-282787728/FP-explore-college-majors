4889026,2,B005TCLBY8,"My wife is a big fan of the History Channel, Military Channel and all things historical when it comes to dramas. So when this film showed up I figured we had a decent night of movie watching together, even more so when I noticed the film's running time at 191 minutes. While she found it okay I found the movie to be a tad excruciating but tolerable at times.

The movie takes us behind the scenes of the last flight of the infamous Hindenburg in 1937 that ended in it's explosion when it reached the U.S. Actually it opens with that explosion before taking us back 4 days to when it was starting it's last voyage. We meet several characters, most importantly Merten Kroger, an air enthusiast who accidentally meets Jennifer Van Zandt. Jennifer is the daughter of Edward Van Zandt (played by Stacy Keach, perhaps the only recognizable name in this mostly German cast), a wealthy industrialist who wants trade with Germany to open so he can sell them helium for their dirigibles.

When Edward falls ill his wife and daughter want to get home to him as soon as possible. Their best bet is the Hindenburg and they book their way home. When Edward hears of this he becomes upset and calls to get them not to get onboard. His assistant tries to get word to them but not before he confronts Merten in a men's room over information Merten has that there is a bomb on board. The end result of their fight is his death and Merten being told to get Jennifer off the Hindenburg. Not an easy task as the Nazis are now trying to prevent him from doing so.

Of course Merten does get on and in an attempt to find Jennifer is waylaid by an unseen enemy. When he wakes he frees himself and finds word has already gotten on the ship that he's a murderer and needs to be captured. He still finds a way to get to her and tell her what is happening which of course no one else believes. Not until several things happen in the course of the film does anyone think that a bomb is possible. From that moment on the search for the bomber and the bomb take center stage but that isn't until the last 40 minutes or so.

So what fills the rest of the time? The movie becomes almost like one of those classic disaster films from the 70s. We're introduced to numerous characters that have their own quirks and problems. One is a German family where the father wants to get them safely to Argentina while his family fights him all the way wanting to stay home in Germany. The obvious fact that there must be a reason he wants to leave is easily figured out early on, even more so when a German officer becomes attracted to the wife and attempts to bed her. There is the charismatic stage performer who does magic, offers speeches and reveals any and all secrets relayed his way. Then there is Jennifer's mother (another recognizable name in Greta Scacchi) and her entourage. We're also given the bickering between the captain of the Hindenburg and the company representative who go back and forth over who is in charge.

All of this makes for a relatively boring movie. At times it feels as if you are actually on a transatlantic flight when the pacing moves as slowly as possible. The action in the film feels forced into the story and the scenes in the dining room feel incredibly slow. There are moments where true plot development bursts forth, not only in the bomb story but the personal ones as well, but these are so spread out as to barely get your notice when they appear.

On the whole fans of dirigible, the Hindenburg or of pre-WWII Nazis might enjoy this movie. For the most though it is far too long and tedious. I don't see this being a movie that will elevate its cast to bigger and better things. Instead this seems like a movie that will hit bargain bins sooner rather than later.",1393372800,,3768,4.398852223816355
4889027,2,B005TCLBY8,"A Disaster Movie.

I'll save you a lot of time.

The 1975 Movie with George C. Scott and Ann Bancroft is a better movie.

The actual tragic crash of the real HINDENBURG was over in a few minutes and so, it becomes necessary to insert a story leading up to that incident in order to justify the making of a movie.

In any disaster movie, one has to care  about the characters portraying the real passengers in order for the movie to work. In this case, I didn't care one whit about anyone on board in this version. The ending is pretty spectacular as SFX have come a long way since 1975, but the improvements are not worth all the extra money that this DVD will cost you and the movie, as a whole, is not as interesting as the 1975 version.

It is interesting to note that the Hindenburg sets in this movie are not as interesting as the '75 version and the camera angles are not as varied. This movie looks like most of it was made on a sound stage and, although I'm sure the old movie was made on a sound stage as well, it has a much more realistic look.

As a footnote, I noticed that the lightweight wall panels in this version had a different covering than the 1975 version. I wondred about  this until Robert Osborne pointed out that the original plans for the real airship were destroyed during WWII. Save your money. Buy the 1975 version.",1392768000,12,1344,4.2637795275590555
4889028,1,B005TCLBY8,"I saw this film as a 'special' mini-series premiere on Encore Movie channel in the U.S. in March, 2013.  Like a horrific accident on the side of the road, I could not tear my eyes from it.  The acting and dialogue are so bad, it's laughable.  The directing is horrid.  The only people on the film that did a decent job are the production designers and the VFX people, but in this day and age of green-screen filming, how could it not look good?  I wish 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' was still on.  They would have a field day with this stinker.",1363478400,3,545,4.294117647058823
4889029,2,B005TCLBY8,"Achronistic rock music blares over the credits to Hindenburg. The score doesn't just fail to set the scene or add to the period feel, it completely takes one out of the pre WWII setting.

Ditto for the actors, who read their lines as if they haven't shed their characters from the last action movie they've done. There's very little period feel, apart from a few Nazi flags and uniforms.  Period NYC looks a little better.

The script fails to hang together very well.  One character hears there a bomb on board and witnesses a murder over it, yet flips a coin and then boards the airship without any explanation for why he would take such a rash step. A Luftwaffe officer has a shipboard flirtation with a married woman.  When she gently rejects his continued pursuit (odd since he's a Nazi and she's just been outed as Jewish), he exclaims ""But you kissed me!"" as if he is 13 years old.  Then vengefully goes after her family for leaving Germany with funds, which Jews weren't allowed to do.  A bomb is planted in an improbable place that requires two people and a rope to retrieve it, yet the one person that supposedly planted it is deathly afraid of even looking out a window.  The only authentic character and acting seemed to me to be little Gisela, a girl who both looks/dresses and speaks as if she were part of the period and background she's alleged to be from.

Also given this is the first Hindenburg movie in a while, it would be nice if we got a really good view of the ship, and the ship was allowed to be as much of a character as the similarly disastered Titanic often is, on its big budget films. They missed an opportunity there.

What works:  The special effects of the fire and the crash are not bad, but not exceptional.  It was exciting, but there wasn't enough detail on who escaped and how they managed it.  What we did see of the Hindenburg was very nice, but there wasn't enough.

The opening shots of the main character, a Hindenburg engineer,  flying a glider were nice cinematography, but why in the world were we watching a glider, and not seeing shots of him on/with the fabled Hindenburg pre disaster?  Who cares about a glider?  Probably a whole half hour was devoted to this, including a picnic with a supposed love interest we never see again. Another area where the script just fails to hang or exploit its subject. But the antique glider and the scenes of flying it, were lovely, if unrelated to the rest of the story. Maybe the producers/writers just like gliders?

Given there's not much to like, I have to put in a good word for the beautiful long-coated German Shepherd that appears early, and due to its master's Hitler spoofing before the Luftwaffe officers, gets put in cargo.  The dog survives. (No explanation of how it got out of a locked crate in cargo, though.)

So: implausible plot, failure to scene set the period, bad score,  failure for the script to hang together or make sense, generally poor acting, big fire at the end, fair CGI, nice dog.  Rent it, or catch it on TV, but not worth a purchase.",1363132800,9,3054,4.494565217391305
4889030,5,B005TCLBY8,"I found the Swedish film with an international cast to be visually stunning. The Blu-ray DVD works in USA machines. The audio is English with sub-titles in Swedish, Dane, Finnish, and Norwegan. It is a well-done thriller and in no way soap opera like in writing. Perfect for the 75th Anniversary of the disaster.",1338076800,12,312,4.796296296296297

8486060,1,B005TCLBY8,"Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of lighter-than-air, dirigibles in particular, so I bought this, hoping for a much more enjoyable movie..the story itself is shaky, the acting is terrible..special effects were passable, but not exceptional. In one sequence, a man gets the tar beat out of him by the crew as they seek information from him..he later washes himself up and emerges with only a small split in his lip..that`s all. As he & another crewmember search for a bomb planted outside of the airship, they miraculously know EXACTLY where to look on an immense 800+ foot long craft and find it within minutes. If I had acted in this dud, I would be ashamed to admit it. I`m thankful I didn`t spend a lot on it.",1440720000,6,748,4.467153284671533
