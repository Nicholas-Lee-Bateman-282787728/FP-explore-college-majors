8201166,2,B00000JKVS,"Billy Cobham is one of my favorite drummers, but unfortunately he wasn't the best speaker at the time he made this video. His speaking style is choppy and a bit long-winded. I was hoping for some lessons on how to do some of the things he does(beats, fills, etc.), but there really isn't much of that at all. It's really just Billy going on and on about things that aren't very interesting, and then playing a drum solo after every segment. Not worth the money at all.",1169424000,,468,4.390804597701149
