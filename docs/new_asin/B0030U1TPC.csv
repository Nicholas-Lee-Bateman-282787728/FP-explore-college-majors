8386078,5,B0030U1TPC,"The last installment of the Huntik series, season 4 contains their season finale which like a lot of Japanese anime doesn't exactly end the way we're used to.  Still it was a decent conclusion to the series.  I have loved it from the first episode.  It is designed for a younger audience so it is very kid friendly.  I would recommend it as a family show.",1393459200,,355,4.333333333333333
