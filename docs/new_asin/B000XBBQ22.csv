8227709,2,B000XBBQ22,"This DVD had very little if anything at all to deal with Canon equipment.  As far as advance techniques go, I did learn anything I didn't already know.",1407974400,,151,4.392857142857143
8227710,5,B000XBBQ22,"I have purchased 3 of Tim's DVD's on Canon and through the eyes of a pro, all 3 were great and I watch them over and over when I have a lighting question or what ever. Tim is very good with instruction, he uses words that everyone can understand. Great job I cannot wait until he puts out another DVD

8227711,4,B000XBBQ22,"Tim is a great teacher and very easy to listen to. When you watch this video, don't just look at the surface of what is there and whast he is saying. Learn from looking at whats in the background, his equipment, how he changes angles and settings. You will learn much more this way. I highly enjoyed this video. His website is well done as well.",1237248000,,345,4.242424242424242
8227712,1,B000XBBQ22,This video will not help anyone that has any real experience with photography.  Unless you are a beginner I would pass on this DVD.,1234483200,,131,4.458333333333333
8227713,1,B000XBBQ22,"Like one other reviewer, this DVD does not help with the use of a Canon Camera. The photograper uses a Canon in his studio but uses a Nikon while shooting outside. The DVD does not explain the different funtions on a Canon Camera, instead talks about how he takes pictures and explains how he took certain pictures that are being shown on a computer monitor.  They thank Tamron for the use of their lens instead of using Canon lens and explaning about the difference in ""L"" series versus other types of Canon lens. He mentions taking pictures using ""RAW"" format but does not go into detail of why you would shoot using this format. He talks briefly on tungston but does not get into detail.  All in all a very poor DVD for Canon users.",1233705600,,735,4.437037037037037
8227714,4,B000XBBQ22,"Same good product as volume 1. Tim has some great pointers about lighting, and overall about how to approach professional photography. If you are serious going into the pro-photography, this will be helpful to have in your library. I've bought volume 1 and 2 at the same time, and I am glad I did.",1202515200,,297,4.518518518518518
8227715,5,B000XBBQ22,"After having purchased and liking Blue Crane's DVD about my Canon 30D, I bought volumes 1 and 2 of Through The Eyes of a Pro and was not disappointed. I really liked the DVD about my camera and wanted to take the next steps in my photography. I thought these DVD's were full of useful information that I can try right away. I will have to go back and watch again though because there is too much to digest in just one viewing. I highly recommend Through the Eyes of A Pro for anyone wanting to improve their photography beyond knowing what the buttons on their camera are for.",1197936000,3,576,4.293577981651376
8227716,4,B000XBBQ22,"I found this and the 2nd video in the series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Through-the-Eyes-of-a-Pro-Advanced-Techniques-for-Canon-DSLR-Photographers-Volume-2/dp/B000XBBQ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Through the Eyes of a Pro:  Advanced Techniques for Canon DSLR Photographers, Volume 2</a>&nbsp;interesting and helpful. It supplied me with information and ideas, as well being easy to listen to.

I have begun putting into practice some of the ideas in the video..

Particularly good for new and interested amateur photographers.",1197763200,3,575,8.095238095238095
8227717,1,B000XBBQ22,"This video is OK, but I did not get much useful information or advanced techniques from it.  I think you would do much better reading a book.  This video is not very specific to Canon as stated in the title, and is mostly an Interview.  Portions of this DVD are in Volume 2, so there is some overlap.  I wish that there were some good techniqes or tidbits in this video, but I was very disappointed.",1196985600,2,399,4.2105263157894735
