I thought I was ordering two different movies, (""The Life of Christ"" and ""The life of Jesus Christ"") because of the titles, only to discover they were the same, with the exception of a longer running time on one of the DVDs (I think); however, the quality was poor on both...same actors same scenes, same-same.  The picture, in some sections, was so dark we thought the T.V. had cut off until we heard audio; however, fast-forwarding didn't help nor could we enjoy the movie so after a couple of hours we cut it off. Quality was just bad; the worst I've seen to date. The audio wasn't much better. No thanks to reordering either movie. These must have been recorded by the same company at the same time. I should have acknowledged the review written by one of the customers who inferred to order with caution... I know some of the reviews indicated the movies were old and not to expect a quality picture but I did not expect what I got.  I have purchased old movie DVDs in the past but none with such substandard picture and audio quality.  Nope, I won't be reordering either of these.",1516579200,,1132,4.449275362318841

8076169,5,B000A8AX90,"In an age when Christians are led, thankfully, into a profound personal relationship with Jesus Christ by a deeper reading of the scriptures following upon the Protestant Reformation, we need to remember too the holiness of God, and this production brings that awareness about - superbly - with the very fine portrayal of Jesus, himself, herein.  It is memorable, it is holy acting, and it satisfied my soul to see Jesus' spiritual divine life and dignity so finely portrayed along with his humanity in all his moments with his family,  with children, supplicants, lepers, ailing men and women, among his disciples, and before Pilate and the Pharisees.  The Crucifixion is magnified in pathos and passion by the spiritual dimension and holiness of the Man, Jesus.

The actor achieves this offering by a  glimpse of Jesus' perfection as the Son of Man and the Lamb of God, in his posture, gesture, vocal timbre and tone, grace of movement, and right 'reading' of scripture in his delivery - while conveying resonances with the Holy Spirit's vision of Jesus' whole life and purpose beyond the scope of the gospel, that accord with Jesus' other manifestations in the times before and after his life and death and crucifixion and resurrection - his prophesied visitations as the Lion of Judah, King of Kings, Victorious Saviour.  In portraying Jesus' manhood as rejected prophet, priest and king who willingly subjected his almighty power to man's judgment so that God his Father might use man's evil judgment for good - the actor bases his portrayal of the Christ's manhood upon Jesus' Godhood. (Credit for this presumably extends to the director, producer, and script writer.)

We loved this most of all after viewing five other very commendable versions of the gospel told in the context of Christ's life, death, and ascension.  The emphasis upon Jesus' holiness while in this world centers the narrative emotionally and intellectually upon the divine Truth, providing contrast with this present age as well as his own time then, and comforting us with His tenderness which is endowed with greater authenticity by this contrast of divinity and corruption.  Yours Truly treasures this production of Jesus' life.  t 'reading' of scripture in his delivery - while conveying resonances with the Holy Spirit's vision of Jesus' whole life and purpose beyond the scope of the gospel, that accord with Jesus' other manifestations in the times before and after his life and death and crucifixion and resurrection - his prophesied visitations as the Lion of Judah, King of Kings, Victorious Saviour.
