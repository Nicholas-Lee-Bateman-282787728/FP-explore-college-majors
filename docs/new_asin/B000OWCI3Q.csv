8186980,3,B000OWCI3Q,"Rich and pretty Deepa (Sharmila Tagore) comes to Paris to get away from failed relationships in India.  She meets Sam (Shammi Kapoor), who falls in love with her and tries to win her affection.  In the meantime, wicked gambler Shankar and his evil friends are scheming a way to get Deepa's money.  What follows is kidnapping, impersonation, and dangerous adventures.

Filmed in four locations outside India, An Evening in Paris is lovely to watch.  As for the plot-- the better part of the first hour of the is spent with Deepa in various locations, pretending to ignore Sam who is behind her, singing.  All the excitement comes in the last 30 minutes or so, and the climax occurs too quickly.  Kapoor is energetic and exuberant in every movement, which is entertaining.  Tagore, who shocked the public by wearing a bikini, does a nice job of playing a double role.  The music, and there is a lot of it, is catchy with a definite 60's feel to it.  Tagore's costumes were exceptionally lovely.  Overall, though the acting is great, the movie is somewhat dull up until the ""thriller"" aspect begins, and there just isn't enough suspense to make it better than okay.",1521417600,,1162,4.731343283582089

Ah, Bollywood in the sixties. Romance is in the air!

""Well, they've taught us a lesson.""
""What's that?""
""If a girl says no, kidnap her!""

Yes, that's actual dialogue from about halfway through this film. And, of course, it's greeted with laughter, though I assume that the laughter it garnered in 1967 was vastly different than the laughter (disbelieving and uncomfortable) it garnered in 2010. I saw this about a week and a half ago, and it's been brewing in my head ever since; I see threads of both the big, lush Bollywood musicals I love so much and threads of the darker, more (culturally?) inappropriate movies I run across every once in a while that make me wonder what the hell the people who made them were thinking. I think I got at least a partial answer to that question while watching this movie.

The basic plot begins with Sam (Prem Rog's Shammi Kapoor), an Indian expatriate living in Paris, being introduced to Deepa (The World of Apu's Sharmila Tagore), who has come to Paris, where no one knows her, to pose as a servant girl and find love. (She believes Indian men are all after her fabulous wealth.) As is usual with Bollywood productions of this style, rather than boy meets girl - boy loses girl, we get boy meets girl - boy woos girl - boy and girl end up together after the first hour. Well, what are we going to do then? In this case, we round the globe with Sam and Deepa as Deepa is also wooed by Shekhar (Bobby's Pran), who knows (unlike Sam) that Deepa is wealthy; he is the son of Deepa's father's account manager, and needs to marry Deepa to gain access to her fortune to pay off gambling debts. There's a great deal more to it than that, but I would be getting way, way into spoiler territory at that point.

But really, you don't watch big Bollywood musical extravaganzas for the plot. You watch them for the music, and the music here is dead on. Mohd Rafi and superstar playback singer Asha Bhonsle deliver some wonderfully catchy songs. Also on the movie's upside is Sharmila Tagore in a bikini; Samanta claimed to his deathbed that An Evening in Paris was the first Bollywood film to feature a lead actress in a bikini (and not just any lead actress, but one voted by Times of India as one of the ten hottest Bollywood actresses of all time in 2003). Amusingly, Tagore, who would later become the head of the CFPC, would express concern about the frequency in which actresses appeared in bikinis in Bollywood films. (One wonders if there even is a porn industry in India at times.)

On the down side, if you're going to invest two and a half hours in a movie, you can't really ignore the plot. It starts out ludicrous and gets worse from there. It's almost like a video game; our hero and heroine overcome one obstacle and another, bigger obstacle is placed in their way, all in very linear fashion (with the exception of Shekhar, who acts as the Snidely Whiplash of the film, always engineering the tricks and sniping from the shadows). It's all very silly, and after a while you just have to laugh at how silly it is, but it's still quite worth your time. If you're a Bollywood newbie, I'd suggest putting this one on the back burner until you've had some experience with more accessible Bollywood flicks (these days, the most accessible of the bunch is still 2004's Kal Ho Naa Ho, in my estimation), but it is one you'll want to come back and see eventually. ** ",1291161600,3,3447,4.488038277511961
