2290572,4,B0009H97JE,"The writers for this show must be psychopaths.  I can't imagine coming up with these compelling twisted stories, but thank goodness for british TV, because they obviously have brilliant, though possibly, deranged, talents to do this for a living.  Oh, great actors to bring it life, as well.",1218412800,2,291,5.041666666666667
2290573,5,B0009H97JE,I just discovered this show a few months ago on BBC America. I'm totally hooked on Robson Green. I've just ordered Touching Evil as well. This is quality adult television.,1211846400,,171,4.733333333333333
2290574,3,B0009H97JE,"""Wire in the Blood,"" another strong British television detective series, is based upon the work of prize-winning British author Val McDermid; it's based in her fictional Midlands city of Bradfield, which she undoubtedly based upon the very real Midlands city of Manchester, where she worked as a journalist for 16 years, and still lives.  It's filmed in the little-seen-here Midlands, rather than London, of which we see so much, and as such, it has a real background feel to it.  It's a crime drama/police procedural, dealing as a rule with the capture of serial killers (a theme some of us may find we've seen too much), and it is gritty, sometimes gory.  McDermid, of course, is considered one of the leading lights of the school of British mystery writing known as tartan noir -- rather more violent and bloody than the usual, and, thankfully, lightened occasionally by that dour Scots humor.  Written by a Scot, duh, which McDermid is. And all those English seem to whisper while they work: it could sure use subtitles.

The series advertises itself these days as ""based upon characters created"" by McDermid. Robson Green stars as Dr. Tony Hill, psychologist-academic-profiler, giving a wondrous performance; handsome, praises be, intense, intelligent, fallible and flexible.  He is ably supported by Hermione Norris as Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan, Emma Hardy as DC Paula McIntyre, and Mark Letheren as DS Kevin Geoffries.  And they all seem to whisper while they work: the series could sure use subtitles.

Unfortunately, McDermid hasn't written nearly enough to keep a series going, and the episodes collected in Series 2, which are written by others, are not up to her standard.  For those of you who've never had the privilege, she's a daring writer, breaking new ground with every step; and her best work is troubling, intensely gory and violent; frequently involving torture of a sexual nature.  Unfortunately, the four episodes that comprise this series just don't go there.

Disk 1, ""Still She Cries,"" is the strongest, involving Maggie Thomas, a troubled, convicted female serial killer in jail for life(many people would argue that, in fact, there never has been a female serial killer; the American, Aileen Wuornos, was not a proactive hunter, merely a reactive.)  It also involves a predatory, pretty blond student of Hill's, and a new serial killer preying on pretty blond girls.

Disk 2,""The Darkness of Light,"" concerns an overly religious young woman.  Somewhere on the internet, I noted a comment from a British crime scene investigator to the effect that the hotel room in which a murder takes place in this episode is, in fact, the hotel room in which a murder once took place.

Disk 3, ""The Right to Silence,"" opens on a particularly gruesome murder, body found at a slaughterhouse.  The work appears to be that of a local gangster, already imprisoned.  The story is made a bit stronger by father/son, and brother/brother arcs.

Disk 4, ""Sharp Compassion.""  Someone's killing very sick people in a hospital.  And somehow terrorists, and MI5 are shoehorned in.

The series takes its name from an early Dr. Hill book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire-in-the-Blood-Dr-Tony-Hill-and-Carol-Jordan-Mysteries/dp/0312983654/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire in the Blood (Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan Mysteries)</a>. That book was violent in the extreme, and considerably cleaned up for Series 1.  I recommend it whole-heartedly, but not if violence disturbs you.  I understand the title quote comes from a poem by T.S. Eliot, and rather meant an irresistible urge to kill.  At one time, while he was writing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Work/dp/0446690449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Work</a>; I believe, Michael Connelly, currently most popular American crime writer, mentioned ""Wire in the Blood,"" and said he was going to collaborate on the writing of it. (He had a habit of mentioning past and future books, in each book he then wrote.)  In the event, of course, McDermid wrote ""Wire"" alone.  Well, the current TV series is worth watching - watered-down McDermid is better than no McDermid - but don't judge the author's writing by it.",1210896000,4,4280,5.408132530120482
2290575,4,B0009H97JE,I liked the episodes but they weren't closed caption which was disappointing.  The English seem to speak softly and have the music loud over the talking.,1205798400,,153,4.884615384615385
2290576,4,B0009H97JE,"I love the series, and the videos are great. The quality is excellent.

2290579,5,B0009H97JE,"The second season is even more exciting and action-packed than the first season, especially the first DVD in this set, Still She Cries, where you get to see Dr. Hill's patient Maggie try to reconcile the haunted images of her victims by finding where she buried the bodies, Dr. Hill help DI Carol Jordan and the Bradfield police find their latest serial killer (very good bursts of analysis by Dr. Hill, very gripping.  It feels as if Robson Green is now comfortable with playing Dr. Hill and is starting to live the part).  There's the mind f*ck of one of Dr. Hill's post-graduates, and personally I think she should have really lost her lunch when DI Jordan told her who she'd been with.

The second, third, and fourth episodes are all as different from each other as the first season's were.  Yes, there are a core group of actors but I don't feel as if I'm watching a ""Crossing Jordan"" sitcom.  These all feel as if they are separate movies with full attention paid to script writing, location shoots, camera focus and background scenes, and sounds and soundtrack music.  They don't drag out the latest high-tech gadget to solve a crime which is so common in the US (though I'm sure the crew are working their butts off behind the scenes to give me this wonderful series); Dr. Hill's analysis is the primary tool, and I'm kept glued to the screen watching and enjoying the pursuit and the twists each case takes.  This is very high quality cinema that I hope will be come cult status.  If you enjoy this you'd also enjoy Christopher Nolan's Memento starring Guy Pearse and Carrie-Anne Moss.  Both involve your brain and your emotions in ways I'd thought the screen had long forgotten.",1122595200,33,1688,4.6375838926174495

2290581,4,B0009H97JE,"I like an occasional English police series. The main character, a psychologist, is quirky as one might expect. He doesn't fit the mold, but he works well with the police. I appreciate the dynamic between him and the lead police investigator. The male/female element is there. The supporting cast is strong. Stories are good. It is nice to see the contrast between American TV detectives and English. While the violence of the crime is present in both, the English as police are less likely to engage in force. As an American it is nice to see another setting and set of characters. I really enjoyed the first season and the second is as strong.",1470787200,,644,4.657894736842105

2290604,2,B0009H97JE,"Apparently, according to a commenter here,  this second series is 'written by others'. I have watched episodes 1:and 2 and found '2' weak in writing and directing. 'Tony Hill', the psychologist, spouts psychological rhetoric which veers very close to sophomoric ramblings about personality types in the question of 'who is the killer' and made my eyes glaze over.
An example of poor directing is when some people run out of a burning building, pause weirdly to look at each other, and finally finally get up and run. The little girl's bandana stays in place on her head although she has just been snatched up and rescued by her father.
I found this episode boring and was relieved when it was over.
The 'extras' are exactly the same as the ones from the 1st season.",1405728000,,765,4.708955223880597

2290607,5,B0009H97JE,"This show always works and given that it is formulaic and does resort to putting Tony in danger himself now and again (I can never believe that a cop or other professional would ever get caught by the serial killers they are hunting) it still works. The show provides working stories and a character who is believably so damaged that he only works within the confines of the working world he has committed to. He is a character that knows his limitations, continues to be eccentric without being stupidly quirky (I hate Monk for this reason) and allows enough humanity in now and again that you can believe his intimate relationships work. There is also enough variety in criminals to keep the stories worth watching and attention do dialogue is always obvious.",1400630400,,761,4.7727272727272725
2290608,4,B0009H97JE,"This has what American TV drama lost. That is, a degree of reality. Gil and the crew at CSI can find a partial serial number on a fragment of tail light lens and figure out that they're looking for a navy-blue '93 Chrysler. Bones has a 110 pound woman who can take on any 250 lb., 6'5"" professional boxer. Wire in the Blood has mysteries unfold without any such annoyances. When DCI Carol Jordan gets attacked by thugs, she drops with the first punch and spends a week in the hospital. For someone who's used to American police dramas, this can seem a little slow at first but, if you pay attention and let the story draw you in, it's worth it. The strength of the show is the great writing and acting. If you prefer the special effects and superhuman traits, watch Bones.",1386892800,2,772,4.368055555555555
2290609,5,B0009H97JE,Season two continues the intense drama and character development of Dr. Hill and his relationship with both DCI Jordan and his career. The psychotic characters reinforce what I can only describe as great writing and acting. Wonder why our networks cannot seem to produce anything of similar quality on a reasonable basis?,1377129600,2,321,5.1923076923076925

2290612,5,B0009H97JE,Absolutely love this series.  Found it by browsing on Amazon instant videos.  I have discovered that I enjoy English television.,1357171200,,128,5.35
2290613,5,B0009H97JE,"Wire in the Blood is a truly disturbing, and riveting British crime drama that delves into the darkest depths of the human mind. Clinical psychologist Tony Hill (Robson Green) plays the central character in this series and besides his day job as a university lecturer, he also helps the local police in the town of Bradfield solve the most horrific crimes. His counterpart (for the first three seasons) is the competent DI (later DCI) Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris) whose meticulous, analytic, forensics-based approach to solving crimes nicely complements the more eccentric methods employed by Hill. It is Hill's job to get into the minds of the most depraved and disturbed serial killers, and at times his methods are downright ghoulish (he experiments to see how he could choke himself on newsprint in one case), but his methods almost always yield the results needed to solve crimes.

The second season is even better than the first with four compelling cases to keep viewers glued to the screen. The episodes here are:
Still She Cries - Tony tries his desperate best to get Maggie, serial killer of children (and with whom he has worked for the past five years) to reveal where she hid the bodies of her victims. Meanwhile, there's a serial killer targeting young women, and Carol gets stalked by the killer.
The Darkness of Light - When the police discover an old burial ground dating 500 years holds not only the older corpses but also evidence of more recent victims, Tony comes in to help solve the case. The pattern of the crimes is very similar to the 500-year-old crimes, which leads Tony to suspect a ritualistic element to the killings.
Right to Silence - Carol is now a DCI, and works on a case involving the murder linked to a gang boss.
Sharp Compassion - A spate of suspicious deaths at a Bradfield hospital leads both Tony and Carol to suspect that someone working within the hospital might be killing off seriously ill patients.

Wire in the Blood works so well on screen mainly because of Robson Green's consummate portrayal of Tony Hill. Green has come to own his character, and viewers with an appreciation of how crimes are solved will be riveted by the conscientious method by which Tony works through a case until he solves it. Hill is not without flaws, and is very much a loner, and the only normal human that he connects with is DCI Jordan. The pair share a close bond and there's definitely some sexual tension simmering between the two. The stories themselves are artfully crafted and well-written, though at times the content does get too graphic and disturbing, enough to warrant a short break between viewings! Overall, an excellent crime drama that will appeal to fans of the genre.",1318377600,3,2717,4.791044776119403
2290614,5,B0009H97JE,"I bought this and other seasons of wire in the blood from amazon not to long ago and i just love this show it is the second time i bought this set and i keep comming back to it for more,Robson Green is at his best in this series and you need to watch this show all 5 season's thanks amazon for having such wonderful seller's and the product's i am looking for",1302998400,,359,3.9315068493150687
2290615,5,B0009H97JE,"At first glance, Wire in the Blood might seem as if it is trying to shock with graphic scenes and unnerving antagonists but this is simple window dressing. While the murder scenes can be over the top sometimes, the shock value is used to underscore and emphasise the mind behind it. The killers are frightening, but Dr. Hill's compassionate breakdown of the motive and mind help transform them from terrifying to pitiful... and all without making excuses or justifying behavior. The part I enjoy best is watching Tony discover and lay bare the mind behind the madness.

As an American this show can sometimes seem odd to me, as I have an involvement in the American law enforcement community and it's interesting to see how it's done differently ""across the pond"" (No guns! DCI Jordan has a brass pair since she takes on psycopaths armed with nothing but harsh words!). I also appreciate that more time and effort go into the creation of the profile (Criminal Minds here in America is fun, but ultimately boring after watching this show).

Tony Hill is quirky and intelligent, but highly human and empathic. Carol Jordan is an excellent character as well, and although I can't quite forgive her for not being Carol, Alex Fielding is a worthy successor.  Since I tend to go in for six hour marathons I've started to catch onto the little ""tells"" that let me know who the killer is before the end of the show. This is faintly dissappointing, but it makes the times when I'm wrong even sweeter (and really, can't be helped... the audience has to have something to ""remember"" that ""extra"" by, or the ending is harder to follow).

Bottom line: Good character development, excellent acting, engaging story lines. The longer run-time makes it far superior to anything we have in America. Highly reccommended for the mystery lover.",1300147200,2,1823,4.814696485623003

2290617,4,B0009H97JE,"The second season of WIRE IN THE BLOOD, based on the Val MacDermid Tony Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries, is much more assured than the second season. The episodes are shorter: (instead of two one-hour shows each of the stories is one episode that runs at roughly ninety minutes), and the mysteries are much more interesting. Though the serial killers Hill and Jordan track down in the Northern city of Bradfield are no less arcane than in the first series (one of the killers in this set of episodes takes as an M. O. the methods of heretic hunters and witchfinders in the late fifteenth century), they are more original. The true delight is again the fine actor Robson Green as the awkward but gifted criminal psychologist Tony Hill, who can accurately replicate the mindset of violent criminals with remarkable results. It is almost impossible to believe Robson has elsewhere played a handsome leading man, given his shambling nerdy walk and his general air of distraction here as Hill; his immersion in the character seems complete. One of the pleasures of this series is how different each episode from each other: the first concerns a cruel serial rapist; the second, the religious killings of the ""heretics"" (with some remarkable scenes of magic that are cleverly explained only by the episode's end); the third, a series of violent killings that mirror exactly those of a crime boss already behind bars; and the fourth, a mysterious rash of apparent mercy killings in a large city hospital. There is a strange habit in these episodes of shooting inexplicable situations for Tony Hill to be involved in that are only explained later in somewhat ridiculous fashion--an apparent sexual coupling with a student, a marriage in his garden, and a murder of a beautiful blonde woman in her bed--, but the ideas are fresh, and the acting terrific: Hermione Norris seems even more confident here than before as DCI Jordan, and she and Green have a nice gentle chemistry.",1263427200,,1963,4.9156626506024095
