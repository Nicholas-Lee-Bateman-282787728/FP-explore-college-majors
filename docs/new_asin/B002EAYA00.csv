8367261,4,B002EAYA00,"My mentally challenged son can watch this video over and over again, and never get enough.  Quality and information is excellent.",1374796800,,129,5.142857142857143
8367262,1,B002EAYA00,"We purchased this for our 3 year-old son, thinking they would be as well made as ""mighty Machines"" and the ""All About"" series with Backpack Jack and Hard Hat Harry. However, we found out they are not even in the same ballpark. It says it was an ""award winning"" video.  Apparently the contest was held in hell.  Poor production values, bad narration and music that make one yearn for fingernails on a blackboard. The main character looks and sounds depressed, but then again, we were too after watching this video. Do yourself and kids a favor, and stick with the Mighty Machines series. It is superior in every way. Unless your trying to punish your children, its best to avoid this collection.",1342742400,,694,4.680327868852459
8367263,5,B002EAYA00,"A very old production, but some things are timeless. My almost 2 year old son loves it. Can't beat the amazing price for 4 DVDs.",1327536000,,128,4.16
8367264,3,B002EAYA00,"These videos keep my 2 and 4 year old boys entertained and they love playing along with their own toys. The footgage is pretty old and the commentary is cheesy but as long as the kids like it, fine by me.",1307923200,,204,4.0
8367265,5,B002EAYA00,"I can't believe there are only 2 reviews for this video (and one's from the publisher so it hardly counts). THis is such a great video it deserves better, which is why I decided to write a quick review. My son is mesmerized by these videos. He started watching them when he was 2 and still watches them at 3. I suspect he'll be asking for them for a long time. There are 4 DVDs so you can take your pick of what kind of machines you want to see working (road construction, airplanes, boats etc.). They have tons of footage of machines at work. I've seen various other big machines types of videos and this is by far the best. It has the action the kids want, and lots of it, and it also offers well-scripted and well-presented information about what the machines are working on and why.",1294704000,2,786,4.281879194630872
8367266,5,B002EAYA00,"My 20mo doesn't sit long for many DVD's, but really enjoys these!  He uses his trucks and other vehicle-type toys in all kinds of new ways!",1265587200,,139,4.346153846153846
