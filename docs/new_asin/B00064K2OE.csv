2166482,5,B00064K2OE,"This is a complete workout program that fits perfectly into a busy schedule. Twenty minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the
evening and you will soon see a huge diffence in your overall body
tone. These exercises look tame but believe me they are not for the
meek! I would recommend this product to anyone.",1189296000,11,315,4.543859649122807
2166483,5,B00064K2OE,"I did this excerise back in the 80's when I was a teenager.  I think it is easier for me now in my 40's.  I don't split it up in am and pm because I'm not a morning person so I just do it all in the evening. I actually feel worse if I don't do this at least 5 days a week. But does it work?  YES! My husband even commeted and he never does that.

Worth every penny.",1179705600,14,365,3.525
2166484,5,B00064K2OE,"Easy to use.  After using the DVD for two or three times, I felt more energy and my body felt firmer.",1174262400,7,101,3.8095238095238093
2166485,4,B00064K2OE,"I first tried Callanetics for via the original 60-minute program. I liked the short, targeted, effective movements, but because it was difficult for me to find time to do the entire workout, I decided to give the AM/PM tape a try. The two 20-minute workouts on this DVD include a majority of the exercises from the original video (some have been left out). Although the workouts are designed to be used in the morning (energizing) and in the evening (relaxing), the inclusion of moves in either the AM or PM routine seemed arbitrary to me. In addition, I found the 20 minute format to be a bit TOO short for my liking; just when I was starting to feel like I was getting a good workout, it was over. For some people, however, this time period might be ideal, and these workouts do offer a good introduction to the Callanetics method. As always, Callan is a gentle, supportive, and encouraging instructor who constantly reassures her students that they can go at their own pace. Callanetics is a great alternative exercise style to incorporate into your fitness routine, and if you are pressed for time, these workouts offer an ideal solution.",1155081600,52,1142,4.715
2166486,5,B00064K2OE,"I was also disappointed that this DVD didn't have chapter selections but it really isn't that hard to scan forward to the PM exercises and rewind for a couple of seconds.  It's still a great workout - the best I've ever tried and sometimes I feel like I've tried them all.  Thankfully I already had a basic knowledge of the original Callanetics from highschool so this was just a condensed version.  A tip for anyone interested: I've learned it is easier for me to follow the DVD for a couple of weeks, write the exercises down, and then do them in my living room while watching whatever I want on TV.  This keeps the cheesy 80s costumes and hairdos from being annoying, keeps me from making excuses for not do the exercises since I can do them anytime, and keeps the lack of DVD features from bothering me since I now use the DVD only occasionally as a refresher.  This DVD may be a bit redundant if you have the basic workout but I like the way the exercises are broken up and believe me after the PM program I am very relaxed and more than ready to go to bed (which is heaven since I am a bit of a night owl/insomniac).  I probably wouldn't recommend this if you are just starting out though, it doesn't seem to be a program for whipping your body into shape so to speak like the basic program; but it is great if you are in okay shape and want to tone up or if you are in good shape and just want something like yoga that you can do every day or other day to keep you in shape and feeling good.",1154563200,22,1498,4.1482758620689655
2166487,4,B00064K2OE,I was disappointed that it does not have a root menu to select the program (AM or PM) that you want. That was the very reason that I got a DVD since I already had the VHS and was always having to fast forward or rewind to get to a specific prgram. I sent an e-mail to Callanetics but got no response.,1141171200,29,300,3.8548387096774195
2166488,2,B00064K2OE,I love Callanetics (basic?).  I bought the VHS original in 1986 and have used it off and on for almost 20 (!) years.  I recently bought the AM/PM Callanetics and the Stomach Callanetics DVDs but was disappointed to see that essentially there was nothing new in either of the DVDs.  I can recommend original Callanetics but don't waste your money on these retreads.,1114646400,69,364,4.746031746031746
2166489,5,B00064K2OE,"My dvd player allows me to stop and turn off the player and then that evening I turn it on, push play and it starts at the PM exercises.  I love these exercises and am finding myself getting out of bed to do them easily.  They seem to be working but haven't been doing them too long. The length is just right for regular weekday mornings for me, not too long.  I am feeling stronger everyday and more capable of doing the exercises just as Calen does them  (sort of )",1111968000,28,467,4.0989010989010985
2166490,1,B00064K2OE,"I am so disappointed in this DVD.  AM/PM is my favorite Callanetics tape, precisely because it is divided into two distinct workouts.  I wanted the DVD so I could skip immediately to the PM workout, rather than FF through my VHS copy.  I somehow just assumed the DVD version would chapter the two workouts separately.  Instead, just like the original Callanetics DVD, there is no chaptering whatsoever!  Given the price being charged for this DVD, there is just no excuse for such a shoddy production.  Save your money and get the VHS version.",1101945600,149,543,4.78494623655914
8038423,3,B00064K2OE,"It was okay. A variation of her other video. Her workouts are strenuous for sure, so if you're older as I am, take care as you are advised to do in the opening.",1454803200,,160,3.878787878787879
8038424,5,B00064K2OE,"This exercise program looks easy, but it is not!  It is easy to do the movements but the work out is a tough one if you do it right.
I am very pleased with the results, it really works your muscles deeply.",1311292800,,205,3.880952380952381

8038429,5,B00064K2OE,"If you want to see fast results, this is the program. In ONE week I could feel and see a difference. In a month I had gone from flab to flat. I highly recommend these exercises. I love this 25min version, because I have time do it before I have to get the kids off to school.  They are simple and easy enough, even my kids do them with me. GET IT. It's worth every penny.",1271980800,6,371,3.8815789473684212
8038430,4,B00064K2OE,"fantastic program - totally works. very 80s and very slow, soothing. not modern or 'fun'. but you WILL see results.

this particular cd is nice because it has two 20 minute work outs. Its not good though because its just the vhs put onto a dvd with no new formatting, so you can't 'skip' to the 2nd work out unless you remember the exact time you are forwarding to.

overall, its the same exercises as the regular work out. i would purchase the 1 hr original callenetics video, and if you have less time break it into 20 minutes chunks yourself.",1269302400,3,545,4.3861386138613865
