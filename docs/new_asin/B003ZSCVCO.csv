He makes us believe whatever he is feeling and takes us along for the journey of seduction of your soul ...I love and adore John have since Babarino days sawsomething special about this boy and knew he would be a ! !Big !star one day and a Great actor .Hehad this undeniable boyish charm and sex appeal and withumor that was so intense it made me fall n love with himover and over again  with every character he played it was so believable ..This is one of my favorite movies by John it's a live story about two people who were thrown together because of life's circumstances.  Thought it was a beautiful love story between to people from opposite worlds in every way.  T hat is what made it so special and beautiful .The age difference dissipated after you saw them together and how they melded and meshed together when they were Ali e with each other and away from outside influences.  I am so happy that in the end she chose to follow Her heart and not he head.  In truth the heart never lies..So always followyourheart when itcomes to love and life.

I think People's idea of a leading  lady is someone who is drop dead gorgeous not someone who does stand up I think that this movie was done before its time I think it would have done better at a later time I read the book and I think both are great
People's idea of what beauty is astounds me at time because the actress was Lily Tomlin and the actor was John Travolta the question is why would they pair those two I say why not both are nice looking and great actors I suppose that if the leading lady had been someone else it would have gotten better reviews which is really sad anyway I like the movie and the book if you have a region free DVD player I suggest you get this video judge for yourself oh and read the book",1467590400,2,807,3.950920245398773
