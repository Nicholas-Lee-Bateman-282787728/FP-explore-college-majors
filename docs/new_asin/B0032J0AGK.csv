8401799,4,B0032J0AGK,"This DVD is ""NASCAR Driven to Win"". The photo and description is misleading. Since I had already purchased this particular DVD directly from Biography.com, which is the ONLY NASCAR related DVD that it sells online, I wanted to avoid buying what I already had. The first time I called Amazon, the customer service agent assured me that this was a completely different DVD. So I logged on to Biography.com to check if they added another DVD and the only one they offered was ""NASCAR Driven to Win. When I called Amazon the second time, I was once again assured that this was a different one so I ordered it and was very frustrated since I did my part to make sure that I knew what I was ordering or so I thought.

Don't get me wrong. If you haven't already purchased NASCAR Driven to Win, it's a great DVD that I enjoy very much.",1313884800,,827,4.37012987012987
