My 3.5 year old son easily relates to this DVD and asks to watch it over and over. It's his favorite DVD at the moment. It's very appropriate for preschoolers, especially as they begin the new school year and as they encounter similar situations as Andy Applebutter.",1285459200,,369,5.065573770491803

8129321,5,B000G79SLE,"My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves Andy Applebutter. She asks me to play the video over and over again.

The lessons it teaches about being the new kid on the block and standing up for yourself are great for younger children.

I would definately recommend this video to parents!!

8129322,5,B000G79SLE,Jared loved the bullying episode --  We were able to openly discuss on how to handle friends that are not so nice.  It is a show that helped my kid understand real life situation that he may encounter.  I highly recommended it.,1164585600,,227,4.357142857142857
8129323,5,B000G79SLE,"Usually when I ask my daughter how's school, she usually responds fine. Well, today something amazing happened. She opened up to me after watching this dvd! There are two stories in this show. One is about bullying and the other is working together as a team. Apparently, my daughter was being bullied at school by a girl in her class. She never wanted to tell me about it. Which explains why her response to me about school was always fine. Well, that is until she watched this dvd. This show gave my daughter the courage to speak out about her bully situatuon. Thank you",1152403200,,572,4.509615384615385
