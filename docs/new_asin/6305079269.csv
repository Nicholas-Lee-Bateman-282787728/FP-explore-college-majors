961767,4,6305079269,Good movie with many popular actors from years ago.  I believe Farrah was the youngest.  I have to watch it again with no interruptions to give you a good review on this movie.,1246752000,,176,4.303030303030303
961768,5,6305079269,"It's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it doesn't make sense. I bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic TV show. Robert Stack plays the role of Captain Larkin, Hugh O'Brien plays the role of Detective Daniel Myerson, and the beautiful young women was Farrah Fawcett majors who played the role of Karen White. This was your typical airplane movie where it took about 15 minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight 502. After the jumbo jet takes off Captain Larkin gets a radio call from security in New York City. First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box. Next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases. All and all the weasel gives this movie 8 star. As far as Farrah Fawcett Majors goes, she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge.",1171324800,12,1236,4.197478991596639
961769,3,6305079269,"This is a good TV movie mystery. Sometimes it's just fun to watch a good mystery. Terrorists? I didn't see any. But I do have to comment on some knocks to this film's cast.

I read in a previous review about Had Beens and Almost Weres? Obviously someone under 25.

Ralph Bellamy and Walter Pidgeon are character actors with many years of expertise and are/were excellent actors, not ""Had Beens"". The same reviewer's ""Almost Were"" Fernanado Lamas was a sex symbol star a couple generations ago and is a veteran actor with a great deal of talent. The other Almost was, Polly Bergan, who co-starred in Cape Fear with Gregory Peck, is a veteran actor with many films under her belt and a former cosmetics executive as well. Sonny Bono was pretty good at several things before his untimely death, one of them being mayor of Palm Springs. Danny Bonoduce is just Danny Bonoduce, I'll leave it at that.

So what is the requirement to be a ""worthy actor""? Not to do TV movies? Then an awful lot of very skilled actors and former big stars are in trouble.

This film is an enjoyable mystery with a wonderful, talented and experienced cast. No more, no less.",1137715200,5,1147,4.553398058252427
961770,5,6305079269,"So barks iron-jawed Robert Stack at the end of this draining flight. This movie is almost more than a body can handle. Flight 502 leaves New York for London on a routine flight, routine that is until a letter shows up in the first class lounge. There will be murders on this flight.

But who is the killer? Who will be the victims? And why? Could it be the priest who wears fingernail polish? The Davy Partridge look-alike kid who likes to play with smoke bombs? The has been rock star? The bank robber? The mystery novelist? The doctor? Or could it be the lovely stewardess played by Farrah Fawcett-Majors?

I cannot give the ending away because it will blow your mind. Even Agatha Christie could not com eup with a plot with so many twists and turns. But I'll give you a hint. When the second stewardess spills her suitcase, look at the contents VERY carefully.",1104710400,10,863,4.490445859872612
961771,3,6305079269,"Okay, you know the drill - there's a killer on board the plane, a controller is sweating over the microphone and scouring the city for a psychologist, the plane teems with the suspicious.

  MURDER ON FLIGHT 502 is cheesy fun.  It owes its existence to the popularity of real movies like AIRPORT and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  Like those predecessors, this made-for-television movie (1975) is chock full of familiar faced guest stars.  Small screen stalwarts like Hugh O'Brien and Robert Stack, had-beens like Walter Pidgeon and Ralph Bellamy, almost-weres like Fernando Lamas and Polly Bergen, annoying gadflies like Sonny Bono and Danny Bonaduce.  Directed by George McCowan, who went on to direct television's ""Fantasy Island,"" which ought to be all the warning you need.

961772,4,6305079269,"I have read several plot analysis written by the ""pros"" and they seem to be all wrong. There is no terrorist on the plane. The story is about a letter that is found in the first class airport lounge after an international flight has taken off. The letter states that there will be murders before the flight lands. The best part is the ""WHO IS THE KILLER"" set-up. Farrah is in one of her first roles and just as lovely as ever. Adam Brooks talent was not shown enough.",985910400,15,467,4.258426966292135

961916,3,6305079269,"Murder on Flight 502, 1975 film

The movie begins with a view of an airport (JFK on Long Island). There is a flight to London. We see the passengers and their characters. One man is tense and nervous. These passengers wait in the First Class lounge. A man could carry a pistol on a trans-Atlantic flight. ""Didn't you used to be Jack Ainsley Marshall?"" This Boeing 747 is cleared for take-off. Back at the first-class lounge a package smokes, they call security. A bad joke? An unsigned letter tells about murders on Flight 502! They warn the pilot. The police sergeant is consulted: psychopaths can look like anyone. One passenger is a surgeon on a confidential mission. ""Do you want the truth?"" Who stole a serving fork? The passengers talk about themselves. Then one man suffers a heart attack. There is drama in the treatment. A life is saved. A mystery writer makes an observation about a passenger. This is confirmed back at JFK.

There is an attack on one passenger, we learn who stole that serving fork, and why. Why do kids use drugs? They get involved with the wrong people. Marshall shows his wisdom. Can getting a drink of water be dangerous? Is there a place to hide at 38,000 feet? ""Did anyone see anything?"" Someone is looking into suitcases. A flight attendant brings a tray to the flight crew. The captain announces the news to the first-class passengers. One man fears for his life. Then there is another surprise when the murderer reveals his identity. A shot causes a fire in the first-class lounge! They must make an emergency landing now. ""What a nightmare!"" The captain solves the mystery of the planted money. The murderer's talk tells of his mental state. ""A fine job.""

This seems to be made for television because of its low production values. It has some actors who are near the end of their careers, and some who are becoming famous. [I had a hunch before the murderer was revealed.] Parts of it reminded me of the 1934 film ""Mystery Liner"" or Agatha Christie's famous ""Ten Little Indians"". It's a good film overall, but one character seems implausible.",1482278400,,2081,4.695890410958904

961923,3,6305079269,"Of all aviation terror movies made in the 1970s, ""Murder on Flight 502"" is among the most preposterous. Don't get me wrong, it's plenty entertaining, but not necessarily in the way producer Aaron Spelling likely intended. I should open with the fact that I am an airline pilot, and as such I obviously can spot factual flaws in the film much like a professional mariner can see through the veneer of ""The Poseidon Adventure."" I will attempt to refrain from mentioning technical errors in the film (which are pretty much continuous) and instead dwell on the plot. The only exception is that I will mention that I laughed out loud when Robert Stack as Captain Larkin had to go to the flight deck to give the copilot (First Officer) instruction. This from a man who at one point leaves both pilot seats unoccupied during flight. We generally find that it's better to have someone flying the plane at all times.

If you don't know (or care) about things aeronautical you will be at an advantage here. The film opens by introducing a cast of stars all populating first class (coach is never shown) in a 747 going from New York to London. The backstory and dialogue is humorously dated, while the stock footage and flight deck set are equally dismal. Suffice it to say that everyone is cast to play a stereotype, and that ""Airplane"" apes almost all of these roles perfectly. Where to start? Danny Bonaduce appears as Millard Kensington, a spoiled brat whose present to airport security serves as the opening volley for the ridiculous plot distractions. Next up is Sonny Bono as washed up pop star Jack Marshall. With guitar in hand he has an inauspicious reunion with a fellow passenger brandishing an extra-large serving fork. The highlight of the film was perhaps when Bono actually says to an admiring female passenger ""the beat goes on!"" (Groan.) I don't want to get into the details of the loopiest medical drama in any airplane movie, but will mention that Ralph Bellamy (""Trading Places"") was made for the role of Dr. Kenyon Walker. To sum up: there are more bumbling criminals and loony personality conflicts than most any other aviation film I can think of. And then there's Farrah Fawcett (as Farrah Fawcett-Majors) as lead flight attendant Karen White. She sure was beautiful and actually does a decent job with her role here. I won't spoil the dramatic conclusion, but will mention that Walter Pidgeon, Fernando Lamas, Brooke Adams (as the world's clumsiest flight attendant,) and Hugh O'Brian (as Detective Daniel Myerson) are all suspects in the dastardly dealings on Flight 502.

What I learned from this movie: bullets can start a huge fire on an airplane, pop stars tote their guitars everywhere but when called to play them do so in a strangely unmusical way, murder mystery writers are very insightful and are helpful in solving real crimes, and customs is akin to a really good episode of ""The Dating Game.""

This film is impossible for me to rate as it is clearly a contrived drama with a cast of thousands. It is representative of B-movie aviation melodramas of the day but while it's wholly unrealistic is still oddly entertaining and endearing: I settled on three stars, but it totally depends on your perspective and reason for watching it.

The extras are just plain strange. They include biographies and filmographies of the actors. Well, that's only part of the story...for some reason only the careers of Bellamy, Bono, and Fawcett are featured. How odd that the rest of the cast (hello...Robert Stack) were not mentioned.

If you're a fan of the murder mystery genre from the era or are an aviation movie completest, this is a good choice, just don't expect to be blown away with the logic or realism on display, although the likes of Theodore Bikel and Polly Bergen chewing the scenery more than makes up for it.",1391212800,5,3837,4.790030211480363
961924,5,6305079269,"MURDER ON FLIGHT 502 shows just how dangerous it was to fly on a jumbo jet in the 70s. Within 90 minutes, two people are strangled to death, another is shot, and one poor schmuck is attacked by a maniac w/ a big meat-fork! This should come as no surprise, since the passengers include a bank-robber, a fake priest, an alcoholic crime novelist, and Danny Bonaduce! The stewardesses (Farrah Fawcett and Brooke Adams) are too busy smiling to notice the mayhem! Thank God that Robert Stack is at the helm, or this plane would go straight into the Atlantic ocean! I mean, what kind of an airline allows Sonny Bono onboard one of its aircraft? With a guitar! The next time the TSA has me spread-eagled next to the baggage carousel, I'll be thanking my lucky stars I'm not still back in those dark days of air-travel chaos!...",1389571200,8,819,4.54054054054054

961996,2,6305079269,What can I say? I had never seen this movie. Maybe I was expecting too much. The story line and acting were just OK. The quality of the film was rather poor.,1380672000,,157,3.9375
961997,4,6305079269,"I admit it. I clearly remember Robert Stack as the young man who walks out as Jack Benny begins his big scene as Hamlet,"" To Be or Not To Be"". He was going backstage to see Jack's  wife, Carole Lombard. It was a 1942 movie. Walter Pidgeon, was singing in the early 30's and playing Nick Carter in 1939,  then he was paired with Greer Garson and became a leading mature male star of the 1940's. Ralph Bellamy was Ellery Queen before he was FDR and a genuine star. Dane Clark, I saw in a stage show at the Strand Theater in NYC when he was still being groomed to be the next John Garfield but before the Black List and a series of films made in Italy. So, my judgment of this quite routine plot, threat of a murder on an airliner in a 1975 made for TV movie, cannot be what someone coming fresh to the film and the actors. Theodore Bikel, pushing 90, is still around, but not most of the others, you will be seeing.
So, if your film memory includes Leo Durocher's one time wife (and, you do not have to ask, who is Leo Durocher) and Sonny Bono means more than a one time husband of Cher, the renewal  of remembrances will lead you to enjoy this minor version of the very successful airliner films of the era. If you come to it as something new, you probably will find it a mild, perhaps interesting, TV emulation of the All-Star airplane disaster movie.",1377993600,,1351,4.2084942084942085

962004,5,6305079269,"This review is dedicated to Farrah Fawcett.

I will begin by saying that that the media shoud be ASHAMED of itself for virtually ignoring the death of Farrah Fawcett. Farrah Fawcett was a wonderful human being.

That said, this is a great 70s horror. Everything starts peaceful and nice, and even a bit comical as different characters board a flight to England.

Within a few minutes a smoke bomb is uncovered at the airport. (We later see that despite the possible dangerous consequences, the person only meant it as a joke and didn't want anyone to be hurt or too scared for that matter.) However, because of this, an airport security man finds a letter he wasn't suppose to find until the next day. (This letter states that he is plotting to murder more than one person on the plane.) GREAT SUSPENSE!

Robert Stack gets major kudos as the pilot who must keep his cool with the flying of course, and simultaneously figure out what to do. Farrah Fawcett also gets major kudos as the Stewardess who does her normal duties but may know more than she is letting on to.

It's hard to write much without ruining the movie. But we have several suspects. We have a doctor (Ralph Bellamy) who has been threatened by a man on flight. He feels his wife died because Dr. (Ralph Bellamy) couldn't be contacted or found. We have a man who feels the death of his daughter had something to do with Sonny Bonno.

Robert Stack finds himself in a realistic situation. His superiors seem to find out more about certain parties AFTER an incident has taken place, but they can't seem to do it before an incident. This of course frustrates the Robert Stack character, but it offers us (the audience) some comic relief.

Overall, it's a great movie with a nice normal start, meance, suspense, some badly needed comic relief, and a twist ending that I won't give away.

One note worth mentioning is that Robert Stack finds himself in a situation that happens quite often. Often when you uncover a crime, there were other branches involved. But often one has to 'let the branches go' for the sake of dealing with the worst threat. Also to Robert Stack's credit is that his character knows that with his authority comes the responsibility to NOT ABUSE IT or play God with it. His character knows that his authority is for the sake of people's lives and well being.

Overall, it's a great 70s horror movie as well as a nice tribute to the wonderful Farrah Fawcett who lived her life with dignity even when she had cancer.",1251331200,19,2495,4.576233183856503
