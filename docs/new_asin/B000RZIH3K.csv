8203371,4,B000RZIH3K,"This is an informative DVD for anyone interested in amphibious warfare as it was practiced in the 1990's. For other people, there's lots of good action footage of Marines making landings and moving inland.

I was a U.S. naval officer in the 1960's, serving primarily in the amphibious forces. Amphibious warfare has changed quite a bit since then, and this DVD brought me up to date.

The DVD seems to have been assembled by a British company from various military training and information films, and primarily features US/UK equipment and tactics. There's lots of good footage about seaborne equipment and armored amphibious assault vehicles. There's nothing from the 21st century in it, but there is some history from the 1940's onward.",1220745600,,738,5.090909090909091
