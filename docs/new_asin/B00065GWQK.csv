8038989,4,B00065GWQK,"The dozen NEW 3 STOOGES cartoons in this collection include their opening and closing wraparounds with the real Stooges. All here are well-preserved although colors in the ""live"" footage have faded. Intros and outros of just two shorts, ""Feud'n, Fuss'n Hillbully"" and ""Funny Fugitive,"" aren't washed out. Total running time of this dozen is 85 minutes.

An additional 37 minutes of animations bring this set to just over two hours running time. All of these are from faded and/or stressed film stock. A couple, including the classic ""Dover Boys,"" have hardly any color at all. Little kids probably won't care much either way.
