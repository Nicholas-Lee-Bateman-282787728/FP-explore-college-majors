6130375,4,B00H3WCT4I,"This video is cool. There is a lot some noise in the background, it makes it hard to hear Ellen and her daughter talking. Also, from a production quality perspective, the smoothness in transition from Ellen and her daughter is not as good. Over all, I think it would be good to make the exercise moves a little bit more diverse. It may make some people uncomfortable. It's more profitable when you cater to all cultures.",1479686400,,420,4.5394736842105265

I am now up to ""levels"" and omg it took me a few weeks to get there.  I am now able to touch my toe and get to the third segment.  I love running from the ""fat police"" .

I have looked at different results from their page all the the way to Youtube videos. For those saying that there isn't enough cardio I don't know what to tell you. I had sweat dripping from my eyeballs and could barely see the tv to mock their moves. So. With that being said.. Go purchase Black Girls Workout 2. I am going to try and keep with it and show my results so I can encourage others as well. Let's get it!,1470528000,5,566,4.4

6130410,5,B00H3WCT4I,"I really would just like to commend the two women who created this workout! I saw a lot of complaints about the ""quality"" of the videography...at the end of the day, it is a kick butt workout!

You can really feel the burn while doing it!",1458777600,12,351,4.318181818181818
6130411,5,B00H3WCT4I,"This DVD really makes you sweat if you do the moves as instructed. Concentrate and focus on getting a better body instead of just getting through the video. If it seems light to some, maybe you need to pick up slightly heavier weights, jump higher, and squat lower to get the best out of the workout. I am so glad I found this video and I am doing it without their meal plan. I may try the meal plan in about a month. But I already feel a difference without it. Thank you ladies!

6130413,2,B00H3WCT4I,"Not the best workout Dvd. Yeah I said it. These workout help with your butt(i guess) but what really makes a difference is the MEAL plan they use, which is ultimately taken from someone else. I did this for a month and the results were ok, I was able to achieve better results working out in the gym alone. Maybe this is ok for someone that wants a light impact workout but I wouldn't recommend it.",1457568000,2,398,4.25

I have tried several workout programs, including Insanity, P90X and Jillian Michaels 30-day Shred, but never had as much fun working out as I did with these two women. I work out regularly and really felt the burn while doing this program. I very rarely write reviews but had to write one for this video. I really enjoyed it. The editing wasn't much of a problem. I appreciated the 15 second breaks in between each segment. You will too, believe me!

I really like that they used real women and that all the ladies were shaped different. The only thing negative I could/would say about this DVD is the sound, but other than that this workout was everything. I have not used their meal plan because I already had one, but my start weight as of 10/21/15 was 172lbs.. As of today 12/31/15 I am 155lbs. I use this DVD three times a week Mon, Wed & Friday!

6130466,2,B00H3WCT4I,"This DVD is awful. The quality is garbage. It's shot on a stark white background and the production looks like it was done by a high school tv club. The DVD does not flow smoothly at all. I ended up turning it off about 15 mins in. I might be biased because I'm used to the quality if Beachbody products and even Jillian Michaels DVDs. For me it's a waste of money. You could find more effective and quality products on Amazon for a fraction of the price. Needless to say my attempt at trying to support black enterpenuers is a fail. The reviews I read on the DVD seemed more decent than not which makes me wonder if they are ""real"" reviews or not.",1434585600,,648,4.192

My only complaint is the inability to copy the DVD.  I understand it's to prevent piracy, but I put the first video in my Dropbox..I can workout with it ANYWHERE on my phone.  Hopefully they will offer a digital download.  Then I won't be limited to only using his video at home on DVD.",1432684800,,473,4.306818181818182
6130479,5,B00H3WCT4I,The best dvd!!! I've done Julian micheals DVDs and hip hop Abs and honestly the black girls workout worked way better than the other ones.

6130488,4,B00H3WCT4I,I absolutely love this workout dvd. This workout is challenging from beginning to end and you will definitely busy a sweat. I did this workout during the winter time in my living room three times a week. I did see changes in my body especially the butt area. The lower body workouts were no joke. I would definitely recommend this video. I don't think the price is expensive due to the time they put into making it.,1430870400,,415,4.402597402597403

6130491,5,B00H3WCT4I,I really love it. It's a great workout and my legs are sore for days afterward.

6130502,5,B00H3WCT4I,"After having this video for a couple weeks and finally getting through the whole thing without skipping a segment (but taking a couple pauses lol) I felt like I had to leave a review. This workout definitely pushes you, especially if you don't work out already. Honestly I didn't expect this video to be so rigorous. Being that it is all black women in the video they definitely motivate me to keep going, especially because they are all of various sizes. I am not following the meal plan simply because I know I don't have time to keep up with it but it seems to be detailed enough to easily follow. I definitely recommend this to all women of color, young and old, it may take some time getting used to but you can do it !!!! Oh and you need a set of 5 lb weights, a kettleball and a mat. I just use one of my weights instead of a kettleball but they do recommend a slightly heavier weight.",1428796800,4,892,4.222222222222222

I haven't seen the first one but im used to watching workout dvds this workout was great there outfits, there endurance and the girls behind them were keeping up. I definitely felt the burn in my booty, thighs, and abs. I liked the image editing, and the warm up and cool down was nice. I honestly haven't been keeping up but with dieting and the workout I already lost 3 pounds in a week and couple days. Amazing.",1428364800,3,514,4.202020202020202
6130504,2,B00H3WCT4I,I think this was an okay workout you can tell they are beginners at instructional videos. They just started moves and you had no clue how to do them and a beginner like myself needed the instructions. I won't use this as much my Jeanette Jenkins DVD although it was fun I requested to get my money back it wasn't worth the price plus if you go to their website it's  $14.95.,1428192000,,374,4.194444444444445

6130509,5,B00H3WCT4I,"I do love this DVD! The only improvement that i see is maybe a timer, therefore you can kinda pace yourself and not give up bc you see you're almost done. Secondly it's really long about 50 min which isn't convenient for someone looking for a quick before or after work workout... Other than that i love it ! Great squat workouts and the arm parts are killers too! Good buy",1427673600,,373,4.267605633802817

With that, I decided to order the video myself. I wanted it as a tool in my box (I.e., in addition to gym workouts and walking), so I'm not a daily user. The times I've used it, it has definitely challenged me which is what you need for results. So, I'd say it's good...boot camp in the comfort of your home for less.",1426896000,,492,4.135416666666667
6130521,2,B00H3WCT4I,"You will definitely lose weight, using this video 4 or more times a week. However, the video is not put together well.

6130522,5,B00H3WCT4I,"Bottom line is this program does work if you follow it. If your intent on getting this video is to scan through it, criticize it, hate on Lana's physique, start then stop, get tired just by watching it without actually exercising and eating right of course you won't get results. This workout has toned me up and flattened my stomach in the 2nd week. I plan on continuing to eat right and workout 4 times a week to maintain my results. This is and will be my only workout plan because it works. Good luck hating on a mother/daughter duo doing something positive for women. While you are busy hating you better believe me and thousands of women are getting results while you ""claim"" to be looking for the perfect workout DVD while snacking on chips and eating Mcdonalds.",1426464000,12,769,4.539568345323741

You are guaranteed results within the first week as along as you are following the meal plan and doing the workout everyday! One thing that I love is that they have workouts targeted for BLACK women and it is important to notice how the women in the video looks like various women that you see daily with all shapes in sizes.

They provide a great workout that can be challenging at times. They don't show you a lower level variation but that's easy to figure out on your own.
Some people complained about the transition but it was fine to me and the music was not too loud like one reviewer wrote .
I like that they have real women working out with them and not some model/actress who looks skinny since birth. They have real women on there with curves.

6130579,4,B00H3WCT4I,"I am prior service and personal trainer. I have seen the youtube videos of the first video but I didn't purchase because I had so other ways to workout. As prior comments about the volume, yes, it is low but the upbeat music more then makes up for it. Some people saw things about the cheap set (because it's not like the beach body videos) but I believe the Ector set is just fine because we can look at the things that matter, the women working out and not the weight bench in the corner of a set doing nothing. When people have to do at all these different things to sets it makes the price of the product go up. I believe this family is try to make their videos so that they are affordable for everyone.

As far as the workouts. They can be altered for your ability. You do not have to do everything that they are doing in the video at the same time they are going it. Its okay to move slower and build your intensity, it's okay not to do a jump squat because your knees can't take it, and just do a squat.  I do not think these ladies have the ability to come out of the tv and brow-beat you. But just DON'T STOP!!! If you are in shape, ramp it up, jump higher, move faster, get heavier weights. This video can work for everyone.

I do like the before and after pictures in the beginning because it shows realistic women and their results. But in order to get their you have to get the video and work at it.

The menu plan also has good tips on how to attain your goal weight/body. Believe it or not 85% of a healthy body and fit physic happens in the kitchen, not the gym. What you eat in private will be seen in public. So be careful of what you put in your mouth. You also need to believe that you can do it, because you can. The only difference between fit and fat is one letter, and you must say everyday ""I can do it"".

Lastly, I didn't give the video 5 stars because there is always room for improvement in whether someone has a limited or unlimited budget. I pray that you've found the review beneficial and I would suggest this video to anyone.",1421193600,7,2058,4.096774193548387

6130593,4,B00H3WCT4I,"I received this video about a week ago and just finished completing this workout for the second time.  So far I like it, the workout is broken up into eight sections that are about 5 minutes long (some more, some less).  You will need a kettlebell, a set of dumbbells and a mat.  There are 15 seconds between each section, which makes the workout go by quickly and I like that you can choose which sections you would like to do if you don't want to do the entire workout.  I use a heart rate monitor when I workout and I burned 462 calories without being able to do all reps, taking longer breaks in between sections, and using 3lb weights on the ""Grinding"" section instead of the recommended 5lb weights.  I used an 8lb Kettlebell for the ""Fat Police"" section.  After doing the workout tonight (minus the ""gym grown, no silicone (GGNS)"" section), I burned 335 calories.  Again I used 3lb dumbbells and this time I used a 10lb kettlebell.  The hardest sections for me are the ""Levels"" section and the ""GGNS"" sections, but the entire workout is challenging, especially if you complete it start to finish with no extra breaks.  This workout is high impact, as there are a lot of jumping jacks and jumping especially in the warm-up so those with knee problems or those that are looking for low-impact should buy this with caution.

I have not used the video very long so no weight loss yet, but I did work up a good sweat and got a decent calorie burn.  I definitely believe that if you were to follow their meal plan and do the workouts often that you can lose weight.  I think that almost anything will allow you to lose weight if you stick with it.  The key is finding something that you enjoy enough to do often.  I live in Atlanta, so I do plan to visit their gym.  In fact I just bought an unlimited one month membership and plan to visit for the first time on Tuesday.  I bought this video to get a preview of what their workouts were like and to use for the days when I cannot get to the gym based on my work/travel schedule.

While I did enjoy the workout, what some of the other reviewers have said are true.  I am not a fan of the all white background, the editing is a little cheesy, and they should have used a mic as the sound is pretty low, but overall for $20, I feel like this is a decent value.  I have seen this sold as low as $15 so if price is a concern keep watching for it to drop.  I did not purchase the first video so I cannot compare that one to this newer one.  But based off of the reviews this one appears to the be the better edited one.

The DVD also comes with a 30-day meal plan.  The meal plan starts off with a cleansing phase that lasts for one week.  In this phase you should avoid alcohol, coffee, meat, bread, cheese, fried foods, fast foods, avocados, white potatoes, red potatoes, nuts, soda, and desserts.  It is recommended that you have 4-5 meals a day with a snack (a piece of fruit, steamed/raw veggies, etc.) at least one hour before bed time.  You can have all the fruits and veggies that you would like, but you are restricted for the following foods per day:

2 cups of low fat/skim/soy milk
1 cup of oatmeal
2 6oz servings of yogurt
4 egg whites
4 tablespoons of low fat salad dressing per day
2 cups of brown rice*

*you can substitute the brown rice for 1 sweet potato (eaten plain) on one day only

These are maximums but you don't have to eat to the max on these foods.  It gives a few examples of meals to eat in this phase but that's about it.  After day 7 it gives you detailed meals for days 8-30 and instead of 4-5 meals per day with a snack, you move to 3 meals a day with one snack.  I plan to do the cleansing stage and loosely follow the meal plan after that, picking certain meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack.  Otherwise you would have to buy a wide variety of food to follow the meal plan exactly.  I have not started the meal plan yet, given that its the holiday season but plan to start the cleansing phase on January 5th.",1419638400,4,4000,4.21287779237845

6130630,3,B00H3WCT4I,"I have both the first and second dvd i LIKE not LOVE both dvds the workouts are ""good"" even though the count is off and the music sucks the transition from one segment to the next is off...the production and quality is bad i guess that's because the brother keeps producing the videos next time let someone do it I have seen better Youtube workout videos made from people  with no experience look and flow better then this crap  ....but for $20 what can you expect. Although i own many workout dvds i actually enjoy and prefer Jillian Michaels and its $9 and available at walmart and target i have more success with this type of video. I also follow both the mother and daughter on instagram they Delete certain ""negative"" comments never responding to questions and they pretty much post the same thing like if the mother post food so will the daughter and if the one does a workout video so will the other smh i figure why follow them both when you can just follow one . I find the daughter to be ""fake"" she is always saying ""shots no squats no trips to the plastic surgeon"" while she does look nice but not the nicest trainer i have seen she has gotten breasts implants. So i guess that means she lied. And while they continue to do these 21 day challenges they continue to upload old pictures of ""Gems"" you probably already seen and then they're own personal results don't look any better then the post or pictures before. I guess they are ""maintaining"" the results they have when they should of improved way more then where they are now .The workout is okay but there are way better workouts then this one but i guess i am a sucker for supporting black businesses. But if you're looking for an okay workout with and okay production and okay music then buy but if you want results Jillian Michaels (budget friendly and only 30 mins a day) or any beachbody video set i love TONY HORTON OR SHAUN T..... Oh and the meal plan is outrageous you will not be able to follow it is way to much stuff to buy well that's just my 2 cent.....and you can get the cabbage soup diet off youtubeand lose the 10lbs they claim you lose from ""this"" workout  and if you're smart you would just download this video off the internet and save your money. Any workout you do and eat right while doing it will work i guess that's all for now. DON'T BUY BECAUSE OF THE HYPE BUY A BETTER DVD FOR RESULTS.",1412899200,6,2379,4.329596412556054

If you came here expecting Jillian Michael styled workouts and a bunch of tubular shaped Caucasian women with tight abs, LEAVE NOW
And, if your leaving a comment without a verified purchase check next to your name, you shouldn't be commenting anyway because your lazy azz probably didn't even buy the dvd. I don't understand how people can suggest that these women choose someone else to shoot and edit their videos instead of keeping it in the family and making sure that their brother/son makes money as well as them. If your so interested in the way the video is produced then produce your own dayum dvd

That said, this is my second review, I purchased the first dvd as well as this one. I must say, when I started the first dvd I was motivated, I was ready and I was also going to the gym a few times a week. I lost about 14 pounds and then I just stopped. Started and stopped again a few times in between and then finally this time, 2 weeks ago I said eff it! Its TIME! I popped my dvd in and haven't stopped exercising since. Im down 5 pounds and my butt is starting to raise as well as look more rounded and firm. My oblique's are disappearing and so is my back fat!!! My starting weight was 198 and now im down to 193. If you are truly serious about changing your life and lifestyle, working out and being dedicated then this video and meal plan is for you. If you want to remain overweight, un-comfortable and insecure then continue to make excuses as to why this video hasn't worked for you when yet its worked for so many other women. Their IG page speaks volumes. 21 days and people have lost as much as 10-15 pounds. Its really up to you. Also, people who say the exercises are repetitive..umm..cant the same be said about most dvds?? When cardio bunnies go to the gym and ONLY use the treadmill for 2 hours is that not repetitive and yet effective for some?? okay then. You cant deny that this is EFFECTIVE, THAT IT WORKS AND GIVES RESULTS AND THAT IT HAS CHANGED PLENTY OF LIVES!",1406764800,195,2082,4.338461538461538

I knew it would be a killer workout by reading the reviews so I waited to ""start on Monday"" before I broke it open. This workout is amazing, these two ladies have definitely delivered! I love that they give you the option to either go through the entire 45 minute workout at once or choose which chapter(s) you want to do. I break a serious sweat no matter how many chapters I do, it's just that good. I was a little skeptical about buying it but they know what they're doing and it shows! When I used the DVD on Monday I thought okay this is cool, I can do this...but yesterday my entire body hurt so bad I could barely get through the DVD. Today was a better day because I created my own routine of sorts bby switching the chapters around. Ms Ellen is the truth with that ""Grinding""/arm workout and Lana is a monster with the ""Levels"" and ""Gym Grown No Silicone"" workouts! The only ""negative"" if you want to call it that is the mic could have been better, they do yell but you're working so hard that it isn't really an issue at the end of the day. All in all I don't think anyone would be disappointed if they ordered this. Fantastic job, I can see how this will get you #Snatched! Best of luck to everyone.",1403049600,12,1283,4.17741935483871

6130707,4,B00H3WCT4I,"This is the second DVD I have purchased from Gymnetics Fitness and I am pleased once again. I ordered Black Girls Workout Too two months ago and wanted t sweat a little more so I purchased the second DVD. I like this DVD because it helped me change my life style and the weight has been falling off ever since. The DVD is good to do before and after work. Its 40 minutes, but it goes by pretty quick. It could just be me, but Lana Levels squat workout is a beast! I would recommend fast-forwarding and doing that routine last because it will leave you sore. I didn't have that problem with Black Girls Workout Too. I think they listened to all the negative comments about the last DVD and incorporated a lot of those things in this DVD; such as a warm up, a nice cool down, and the transitions and sound are better. I could have done without the white background, but I like how the workouts are all in 5 minute intervals scenes. Its easy to skip back or skip a workout, or go to the menu and pick the workout you want to do first. I would recommend this DVD!",1402876800,5,1059,4.170731707317073

If you are looking at the quality of the dvd then you aren't concerned about losing weight so don't buy if you care about quailty. Overall i love this dvd. If you want a butt this will definitely get you something close to it or at least tone up what you have. Good luck!,1401580800,,423,3.9302325581395348
6130715,5,B00H3WCT4I,I liked this DVD way more than the first one !! I enjoy that they include a day to day meal plan for 30 days with lots of helpful tips for substitutes because everyone doesn't like to eat the same kinds of foods and or allergic to things. I really believed that they listened to all the critics from their last video and made major improvements. This dvd has become a staple in my work out routine !!

6130730,4,B00H3WCT4I,Good workout.  Not too hard.  I'm a mother of 2 infants that are home with me all day so 45 minutes of alone time is a bit difficult to get therefore I split my workouts.  This DVD has a menu section therefore I do 3 sections a day (there's 6 in total) along with the warmup n cool down and I still get a good workout.  I'm not doing the meal plan cuz I'm breastfeeding but I'm sure I will still see results.  I just started but I love it.  One critic is that I wish sometimes they took time to teach proper form of some of the techniques (mostly Lana's section) and they should also wear microphones which will avoid them from shouting.  The music is louder than them.  But the workout is great.  I'm feeling the burn!,1399334400,2,719,4.115107913669065

The workout is more intense (even though there are more breaks - 15sec between each session), the editing is WAY better and I think the workouts are easier to modify if you're a beginner.

6130818,5,B00H3WCT4I,"I have these ladies' first dvd and I think this second dvd is a great improvement. I'm not sure how to explain it, but the DVD seems to go by quickly and perhaps it's due to how each section is broken up...either way, I love it because of that. I also appreciate that this dvd has both a warm-up and cool down as well as fitness models that are still working on their bodies. Having realistic looking women makes the dvd seem a lot more doable...a couple of them throw me off a bit because they aren't in synch with everyone else, but that is just a minor issue. My biggest issue is that the music is louder than Ellen and Lana so it's a struggle to hear what they're saying.

All in all, the dvd works. I do not follow their meal plan, however, I still see and feel a difference in my body in just a few weeks of using the dvd. My butt is firmer and more shapely, my stomach is going down and I've lost several inches. I'll bet I would look even better if I actually followed their plan.

I haven't had any issues with the quality of the DVD, those that are having that problem may just have a defective one?",1394668800,2,1109,4.105990783410138

6130821,5,B00H3WCT4I,"ABOSLUTELY AMAZING!

First and foremost I'm not the type of person to believe everything I see on informercials or believe that everything I see be promoted on instagram will work. However; I was instantly drawn to this workout DVD mainly because the instructors looked like me, as in being woman not race wise. Most workout DVD's I've seen floating around the face of the product has been male I.E T25, P90X, etc. Im not sayin those products wouldnt work...

Now after being Drawn into the program because they were women, I loved the fact that they provided a meal plan. What would be the point of someone doing all they can working out and still eating the wrong things? I appreciate that Lana and Ellen too the time to add that in.

I recieved the DVD, extremely fast and went right to work.
The sections are quick and to the point. The music is upbeat keeps you interested and helps the time fly by. The transition from one segment to the next was smooth. The workout is intense but guess what? IT WORKS!! Well at least it did for me.

By following the meal plan and doing this DVD I started to see results in all areas. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.",1394582400,4,1154,4.429245283018868

6130824,4,B00H3WCT4I,"Great workout.  The lighting,  white background is a little annoying/aggravating to the eye. Definitely get your mat and kettlebell to truly get the workout!",1394496000,,157,5.5
6130825,5,B00H3WCT4I,This is my second DVD from this duo. I will say this one is a great improvement from the first. The sessions are challenging and I am looking forward to being able to make it through the entire DVD without breaks (in addition to the 15 second breaks they give you in between sessions). I have had trouble in the past with losing weight in the wrong places. I want to trim down but keep my curves and this seems to be helping with that. I am three weeks in and seeing slight (very slight) results but I will keep pushing forward. I think my expectations were a bit unrealistic after seeing pictures of the drastic results from other women who used the video posted online. I don't love that the background is all white and boring but that isn't a big deal. You will also need a kettlebell (a 7 lb one is used in the video) and 5 lb weights. I use 2.5 lb weights but I will work my way up to 5.,1394496000,4,892,4.073863636363637

I have not yet physically worked out,  I just wanted to get an idea of what it was like.  The dvd is organized into segments with the mother and daughter rotating.  The instructions are clear and do-able. You will participate in a rigorous workout routine that it guaranteed to burn calories/fat.  The meal plan for 30 days that is included with the dvd is very precise so you know exactly what to eat. This is a great deal for 30.00! I",1394150400,,573,4.504854368932039

Then I heard that there was a new video being released and decided to wait and order that one. I chose to order the 2 nd DVD because I thought any mistakes from the first would be improved in the 2nd one. I opened my package excited about working out with these ladies. The first thing I noticed was the meal plan and contract. Great. Then I pit the DVD in and the audio was very low I had to turn the volume up a bit. But the workout was GREAT. I completed e entire workout with weights and all and was sweating like its was 100 degrees in my house. I would like to say the workout routine is great. The editing and sound could have been better, but all in all the workout serves its purpose. Abs Omg!!!",1393977600,2,790,4.038216560509555

6130840,5,B00H3WCT4I,I highly recommend this DVD. You will feel the burn . I own both DVDs and the second one is a lot harder an intense . If you are just starting out I recommend the first one then purchase this one when looking for a change . I do not follow the meal plan I currently do WW. But this video is nothing but the truth. My bottom still hurts days later. It's so intense that I'm taking a break to do the 1st DVD for a few days. It's doable but will be difficult for heavier women like myself or those who are not active. I have been doing the 1st DVD  over a month. And I have lost so many inches. I have lost about 11inches total off body. Mostly in my lower body. It's worth the money. We spend this on fast food. It was my best investment . I do this DVD more than I do my nordictrac treadmill. It's all the workout you need .  I'm thankful for these two women for sharing this awesome workout. Trust me you will get results even if you don't follow meal plan . Happy Im snatching it back .,1393459200,2,987,3.9054726368159205

6130848,4,B00H3WCT4I,"I have to say this DVD is really good. I think it's beginner/intermediate for those who don't work out. I like the repetitions because that's what burns. My only issue is the sound seems to be a little off. I liked it because it's not too ""dancey"" I'm terrible with those types of programs. They don't go over the sets before you do them but it's pretty simple to catch onto and follow. There are eight segments which can be broken up into target areas or do the whole DVD. It comes with a meal plan inside but I haven't been following it I have had the DVD for a week now and I can def feel a difference in my body. I have to say for those looking for plump butts, I was cursing Lana out but she will get you there with those squats! : )",1392854400,2,738,3.9932432432432434

6130850,4,B00H3WCT4I,"Ok, so I got this DVD yesterday (picked it up at the post office) and I could not wait to try it out! I must admit, I was very hesitant to buy it due to the price; I am a single working mother and can't splurge whenever I want, but I figured this is for my health and wellbeing, so why not? So I got home and popped it in. I am not doing the meal plan because I am doing a mixed lifestyle (I prefer not to call it a diet) consisting of Keto (low-carb/high-fat) and the Carb Nite Solution (carbs every 5th to 7th night), plus the 30 day squat challenge and upper body strength exercise during the week. I was really excited to do it since I follow the ladies on Instagram and see all the wonderful results. I got through the whole workout but I did stop for a few seconds many times just to catch my breath and sip water. The most difficult sections for me were the lower body and core exercises done by the daughter, Lana. OMG!!! These were crazy hard for me. However, the DVD is sooooooo much fun to do that before you know it, it is all over. I work out in front of a very big mirror so this adds to the fun. I see myself working out and I love to see the muscles "" in action"". I am aiming at doing this workout at LEAST 4 times per week. Yesterday, 2/18 was my first day doing this workout. I hope to update in a month on my progress. I am a 28 year old Hispanic female, 5'3"" and 168.2 pounds. Overall, this workout is FUN. Which is why I can stick to it. I am also taking Vitamin D, fish oil, and CLA supplements, as well as waist training.

2/28/2014 Update:
Since getting this DVD last week (2/18) I have done the workout 6 times. This morning I weighed myself and went from 168.2 to 164.6 pounds with my diet (low carb, high fat). Looking forward to hitting at least 160 by the end of March! I bought 3 pairs of size 8 ""goal jeans"" that I want to fit in soon.",1392768000,32,1866,3.976
6130851,5,B00H3WCT4I,I like the first one but this one is definitely more polished and the exercises are more doable.  I like that the transitions are clear and there are a count down in between the segments to give you a chance to get yourself together...and as stated the workout is now broken up into segments that you can click on in addition to the much need cool down and warm up additions to the dvd ( the first one was lacking this)..you can clearly tell they re-evaluated this and listened to the fans...GOOD JOB KEEP IT COMING...will be sweating to this soon just got this tonight and previewed it.,1392681600,4,587,4.435185185185185
6130852,5,B00H3WCT4I,This a very intense workout! ! But they make it fun and it's very easy to follow. I just love Vitamin Ellen and Lana Gem!!,1392681600,2,122,3.92
6130853,5,B00H3WCT4I,I love Black Girls Workout Too pt 2. I think its better than the first. The only problem is the workout time is too long. But overall a good dvd to produce good results.,1392595200,2,169,4.0
6130854,4,B00H3WCT4I,"So, I sucked it up, bought it and I hope this helps someone. When you first get the DVD, you can tell they put more into it, which is justifiably why the cost is more. The included booklet starts with a pledge you can sign committing yourself to the program and to help you remember you are worth it. Then, the Gymnetics rules are listed.
Avoid white carbs
Get comfortable being uncomfortable
 Dont diet..eat
Water, water, water
Dont eat after 9
Red means stop (no red meats)
It will be worth it.

I cant remember if the 1st DVD had these rules listed as such. When I looked in my BGWOT 1st dvd the little card that came with it was gone. I must have put it somewhere else. But if anyone remembers, comment on it. I do remember that card had the recipe for the soup and I also think for the chilli, but this book oddly enough doesnt. Im sure you can find it on their site, or google it, but I do think they should have had it in there. What I do like about the booklet is how detailed the meal plan is. The 1st dvd it was a little card, not very detailedvery general. Here its broken down into week 1 the cleansing stage which lasts 7 days 4-5 meals w/a light snack. It has specific times and specific food suggested for you to eat and specific meals.so you don't have to struggle.

Weeks 2 consists of days 8-30. Each with specific meals. In this stage you introduce meat back into your diet. Here is a short example of a meal plan
BREAKFAST:
1 tblspoon natural PB,  cup mandarin oranges(no added sugar, strain juice),  banana, 6 almonds
LUNCH: time 4-5 hrs after breakfast.
4 ounces tuna steak,  diced tomato,  diced cumcuber, 2 cups spring blend lettuce, 2 tblspoons avocado,  slice yellow pepper, 2 cups fresh fruit.
SNACK: time 2-3 hrs after lunch
Any 100 cal fruit of choice
DINNER time 2-3 hrs after snack, at least 2 hrs b4 bed
1 lrge bowl veggie soup.

Everyday is like that, slightly different. Then in the end of the book it tells you what vegs and fruits are good to eat  and good sources of carbs and protein.

Now, the DVD
 the opening is cool, we got slow motion, serious faces, abs, getting down to business music, smoke, but most importantly, THEY HAVE A MENU!, the 1st one didnt. I didn't always do it straight through; some days I just did specific stuff. Also they have a 8 chapters with 15 seconds in-between each. In the intro, they introduce the women in it, real life Gems and tell us their backgroundI liked that.

WARMUP-Ellen & Lana
Fairly simple, about 5 mins long. It will get your heart rate up

FAT POLICE-Ellen
About 7 mins long. Youre working on arms, theres some cardio in between each exercise. and use the kettle balls.

LEVELS- Lana
5 mins long. Squats of different variations, butt lifts. These are done on different levels, meaning you get low or you're higher. Youre ass and thighs will die

GRINDING-Ellen
5 mins long. Upper body w/weights. I like it, you even get a little squatting here. Your arms will die, lol.

ROUND OF APPLAUSE-Lana
5 mins. Standing abs w/ some cardio. this chapter was cute and I like standing abs better then being on the floor personally. I do think her form was off on the oblique reaches. I believe she should have been upright, not bent over for a better range of motion and for it to be more effective.

TWERK-Ellen
5 mins.  Cardio

GYM GROWN, NO SILICONE-Lana
10 mins, you need the time to get that booty, lol. Its lana by herself and you need a mat. This is high intensity, there is some pulsing. Your ass will die. Some of my fav moves are in this and some Ive never seen.

COOL DOWN- Ellen & Lana
4 mins.  Stretching, encouraging wordsetc.

In all, its a good DVD. I would like to give it 4.5, but that doesn't exist. You will get results, like w/any DVD, if you do as they say. the reason it gets 4 is b/c while it is a far cry from the 1st one, there are some issues I havethe music is too loud; I don't think they had mics on this DVD. I think they really should have gone to someone else for filming besides their family member. His editing is kind lame and can be distracting. Just my opinion, a workout DVD is not the place to show what you can do with editing. On the flip side, I like how Lana doesnt stop during the exercises like she did in the first, she was doing it with you.

Its worth it to buy it. If you were to chose this over the 1st, I'de choose this one.",1392508800,391,4350,4.263990267639903

I'm what you would call a workout DVD  junkie. You name it, I've got it. They tend to be same after a while.

This video is great! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's almost too many special effects in comparison to the first one, but I love it and I appreciate the effort! It's still a GREAT, hard (but fun) workout as well and that's what really matters! This one is certainly worth the money.
The eating plan is pretty much the same as the first DVD, but this time around they supplied a very helpful sample menu for each day of the plan.  You can follow it, or tweak it to your liking but it gives you great ideas of what types of foods and meals you can put together and stay on track.

Editing issues were obsolete, the workout had me sweating and panting, and I had to stop and take a water break like twice.  What's even more, I saw someone's cardio watch that showed they burned almost 700 calories with just this dvd! My fitness pal was only giving me 353 calories for intense cardio.

Nevertheless this DVD is great! The editing is awesome and the workout routines are a lot more fun. The kettlebell workout was a nice surprise. Standing ab exercises were refreshing to see, as well as the squat variations, and the oh so challenging mat routine that Lana leads is sure to make you sore. The black outfits on a white background creates a great contrast and Lana and Ellen are very motivational throughout the DVD.

Because ""the music sucked"" or ""there is too many people on the screen"" ....dumb things. This 2nd one is an AMAZING DVD & these ladies are amazing for what they're doing .

6130905,5,B00H3WCT4I,"Ellen and Lana's team definitely read the reviews from Black Girls Workout Too and made a lot of great changes. The intensity was kicked up a few notches so if you're a beginner I recommend starting with the 1st DVD. Today was my first day back working out after having surgery in November and I was out of breath midway through the ""Levels"" segment! After taking a short break I finished the DVD with the exception of the ""Gym Grown, No Silicone"" segment because I cannot do much floor work. I did Lana's lower body segments from the 1st DVD as a substitution. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and look forward to getting back in shape!

Pros:
-Improved quality: no weird transitions and shortened workouts
-Plenty of time to cool down in between segments
-Heightened intensity
-Less floor work
-More thorough warm-up
-Cool down added
-More thorough meal plan

Cons:
None!",1389571200,5,879,4.776315789473684
6130906,4,B00H3WCT4I,"If you had the first DVD then you know this is a vast improvement! The first one had tons of editing issues (although I still continued to do the workout because it DID yield results) and it did not have a cool down section or any type of stretching. I can tell that Ellen and Lana really looked at all of our complaints and took that into consideration with this DVD.

There is a warm up and cool down, a break in between every segment (versus the one 10 second break you got in the first) and the AB sections is much longer than the first.

The first DVD gives you the recipe for the soup and chili and a list of DOs and DON'Ts as far as food are concerned but the second DVD gives you a meal plan for thirty days. (Actually the last three weeks - the first week you are to eat the soup and fruits & veggies). The recipe isn't in the second DVD but it's on their website (do your research!)

I saw someone complain that Lana thought she was ""too cute"" to workout as much in the first DVD. Well ladies, she works it on out the entire time so no complaints there.

All in all, I feel like if you don't want to workout you will find stuff like their spelling of ""shrimps"" to deter you from the DVD but it is a good workout and you will see results if you are consistent. 30 bucks was the price of the first DVD when it came out but it's not that bad because it actually works. You need weights and a kettle ball btw. If you don't believe me, go on instagram and look up #blackgirlsworkouttoo or #snatchitback.....then make your decision.",1389571200,35,1536,4.127090301003345

But I love the cover and graphics of this dvd, though I didn't see a huge problem with the first one. They really upgraded. The meal plan actually has a 30 day meal plan for a day to day basis.

6130909,4,B00H3WCT4I,"I liked the meal plan the most. It tells you exactly what you can and cannot eat, and it was easy to follow.  The workout video was a different story for me.  I'm 52 yrs old and I practice yoga twice a week.  I only made it half-way through the first try with the workout, and I was still so sore, i could barely walk for 4 days after.  My daughter (26 yrs old) had no trouble with the workout and completed it several times a week.  I stuck to my yoga and the Gymnetics meal plan for the 4 weeks, with only a few slip ups along the way and I lost 13lbs.  This program is an effective way to lose the weight and get fit fast.",1388966400,3,625,3.84375
6130910,4,B00H3WCT4I,"*** Firstly, please wait until receiving and using product to write reviews people!!! No one wants to read reviews based on your excitement at the possibility of getting product! Moving on...

I ordered this DVD the first day it was released and with Prime shipping had it within two days. Didn't use this immediately as I have a gym schedule and use this on colder days I don't feel like leaving the house.

For many people who complained about the production and editing (which didn't bother me much) of the first video I think you'll be highly pleased. I like how the all white contrast helps focus on the women and technique without being too busy. My only complaint with the overall DVD was the pop in/out and parallel screen which I thought reminded me too much of cheap effects along with there being too many girls in some scenes which just made the spacing onscreen look cramped. Kudos to adding a menu screen so you can skip to whatever your preferred workout is instead of having to work it from the beginning. Overall, you can tell that Ellen and Lana definitely worked on complaints received from the other DVD and invested in themselves to create a better product.

As far as the actual workout is concerned, it's great for those looking to get in a moderate workout at home. I use a HRM and I burn a bit more calories with this DVD than the first. I will note that when approaching these DVDs you shouldn't be concerned with calorie burn but overall technique. These ladies are targeting prominent areas that most women want to work on and I'm sure as long as you perfect that technique you will see results!

For those wondering which DVD will be better for them I will say it all depends on your exercise level. I do think that this DVD will be SLIGHTLY more challenging than the first so if you're on that beginner level go for the first DVD, save some coins and get this one later. In my opinion it's a good follow up DVD for those women who like BGWT but would like a little variety in moves. As always either DVD can become more advanced by doing something as simple as increasing kettleball/dumbbell weight or wearing light ankle/hand weights. I have never used the meal plan and I'm honestly not a big fan of it, especially the soup. It's just logic that you'll lose weight quickly substituting meals with soup. I believe the best way is to simply eat clean 90% of the time regardless of whether you follow this plan or not. I successfully lost 20 lbs and gained lots of definition by eating healthy and doing the first DVD everyday. I was looking for more immediate results but I am certain that anyone can successfully lose or tone with this DVD. In retrospect this DVD is not expensive at all. Ellen and Lana aren't media/tv gurus that can afford to sell a DVD for only $10. Support independent Black women and most importantly INVEST in yourself! It's $30, but can potentially be your sole workout for a substantial period and is nothing compared to how much many spend on gyms or supplement programs.  This is the real deal, real women, real results but you have to put in the work! Thank you to Ellen and Lana for another excellent product and good luck to the ladies out there!",1388707200,412,3207,4.5034364261168385
6130911,5,B00H3WCT4I,"I got the first dvd and got great results, so I was very excited to see they came out with a second one. I see a couple people complaining about the price & yes it is a bit pricey but you can't put a price on your health(besides I've spent way more on hair products & other silly stuff). It is well worth the price, its my 2nd time doing the dvd and I am SORE. The quality is much better than the first and this time includes a cool down. If your own the fence I say definitely get it.",1388620800,8,485,3.8118811881188117
6130912,4,B00H3WCT4I,"Today, was my first day doing it & I Loved it! I have the 1st DVD also and it's good But this one will get you Snatched! Thanks Ellen & Lana :-)",1388102400,41,144,3.53125
6130913,1,B00H3WCT4I,"It's always GREAT to see Black Women in a positive light, HOWEVER, it always must be done in the right way. The first DVD had it's glitches but the FACT that the second has the SAME glitches is sad. My BIGGEST pet peeve is the fact that the meal plan includes grammatical errors! AND says (see recipe) but the recipes aren't included! You can't assume everyone purchased the FIRST DVD. Please add someone to the team to CORRECT this. The plural of SHRIMP is SHRIMP not SHRIMPS. Come on my people!",1387929600,36,496,4.461538461538462
6130914,5,B00H3WCT4I,I received my dvd yesterday 12/23/13. & i watched it before i tried it out! & i must say it is INTENSE!!! once i did work out i wanted to pass out on the floor. This dvd is by far better than the first one. The editing is great and the music is better also! Lana segments are my fav! she now has longer ab section and those squats are unbelievable!!!! SHE CAME BACK FULL FORCE! she also has a section to get your booty nice and round. i know these routines will help me lose my stomach but also keep and enhance my thighs and butt. (we all know those are things we want 2 keep) as loon as they look nice! & this dvd will help you with that! at 140lbs i want to remain cirve but lose the fat & this dvd by all means will help me do that!!!,1387843200,16,738,3.8300653594771243
6130915,5,B00H3WCT4I,I absolutely love BGWT2 DVD!!! Excellent DVD. Vitamen Ellen and Lana did not disappoint with this installment. I broke into a sweat during the warm-up and didn't stop!!!! I wasn't able to complete each segment but that's to be expected in the begining. I'm sore all over but that too is to be expected. Excellent mix of cardio and strength training and focus on that booty!!! Standing abs was a great surprise(I hate doing abs on the floor!) I have the BGWT first DVD and I loved it as well. Much better than the first. I would definately recommend this DVD to every woman wanting to #SNATCHITBACK!!!! Best Christmas gift ever!!! Thanks Vitamen Ellen and Lanagem you did great!!!,1387670400,78,679,4.714285714285714
6130916,4,B00H3WCT4I,"I have purchased both dvds, despite hearing about the bad quality of the first dvd, I have read about ladies receiving great results from it. If we can spend 30 dollars or more on getting hair done and getting our nails every week/every two weeks then I have no problem spending 30 dollars one time on 1. supporting a black owned business 2. on a dvd that will aide in getting me healthier and the body that I want. If you have a problem with the price tag wait until the price drops just like the first one did. Gym memberships cost way more than this dvd, I can't wait to start working out with these and seeing my results while everyone else whines about the price. Only giving 4 stars because a star rating is required.",1387584000,16,723,4.2846715328467155
6130917,5,B00H3WCT4I,"The price is the same as the 1st one! This comes with a meal plan that i'm sooo excited about, cause i need structures and something to follow for my diet, as well with my workouts! I lost 20lbs from their first dvd...trying to get these last 10lbs off with this one, and i'm guarneteed, if i follow the program! I believe in them and their program! I recommend this for anyone thinking they can not do it alone, or need a jump start! I'll be posting my before and afters 2/3/14...starting 1/6/14!!!  So while those out here complaining on high it is, I'll be 10lbs lighter, fit, and in love with my results!!!!  30 days, is $1 a day to myself! Sometimes you have to love yourself more than other things, bet you paid $30 for a blouse without thinking or shoes!!  Lets get Snatched ladies, and show the world BLACK GIRLS WORKWOUT TOO!",1387497600,24,834,4.367741935483871
6130918,4,B00H3WCT4I,"There were many things said about the quality etc of the first dvd, however with all that was said thousands of ladies supported & actually transformed themselves & their lives.
Nothing is ever perfect & only a fool would expect this dvd to be any different. What the nay sayers should do is keep their negativity to themselves instead of taking time out of their day to gripe & complain. No one is FORCING you to pay $30 fir the dvd...
U do have options
- go join the gym
- continue with whatever your doing that (may or may not) be working
-stop the whining.. no 1 wants to hear it!",1387411200,9,584,4.223214285714286
6130919,5,B00H3WCT4I,"I really wish people would hush about the price! I used to pay 70/month for a gym membership fee. Now I can pay 30 and workout as much as I want and it is a one time fee. 30 bucks is not that much!!. The first dvd was the same thing 30 dollars in the beginning, which I paid with no problem because the results were well worth it. My waist line went from a 37 to 29, Well worth it for a one time fee. Any business has to bring in money to keep thriving, if it's too much wait a few months when everyone else is already snatched back and the price will drop. STOP COMPLAINING AND GET SNATCHED. These ladies are doing us a favor, we don't have to go to their gym and pay their fee, which I am sure is higher than thirty dollars. My concern is the results, I spent money on plenty of high quality dvd's that make you think working out alone is going to get you where you want to be. WRONG. Thanks for he meal plan and workouts, I love you guys and don't supporting you!!",1387411200,32,967,3.938775510204082
6130920,5,B00H3WCT4I,I purchased this and can't wait to use it. I can't stand when people complain about the price if it cost too much for you duh don't buy it it's not that hard of a decision the price only went up 10 bucks so what geez smdh.,1387411200,3,222,3.74468085106383

It helped me reach my goal!",1387411200,4,96,3.85
6130922,3,B00H3WCT4I,"I decided to purchase the 2nd dvd because of my results from their 1st one. And yes the editing wasn't the best but hey thats TRIAL & ERROR. As for the music you can blast your own personal music selection in the privacy of your home. The Ectors promote fitness & thats what they provided us with. A great workout + meal plan that provided results. So a one time fee of $30.00 is definitely more appealing than a gym membership that'll certainly cost more than that.

6130923,5,B00H3WCT4I,"The 1st DVD was also $30.00 when it came out and over time they dropped the price. As with anything in sales, the higher the demand, the higher the price. Although there were some quality issues with the 1st DVD, you can't deny the fact that their brand as a whole has come a long way and improved quite a bit. How about we give this one a shot before making assumptions that it's not worth it.",1387411200,38,394,4.12987012987013
6130924,3,B00H3WCT4I,"The price doubled from the last DVD :( that's a negative. That always seem to happen as soon as they get a lil publicity or get a lil big they jack up their prices. It seems like first they were trying to help us and now it's about them making money, The price was a major plus for the First DVD. I loved the first DVD yes the quality wasn't that great but the DVD served its purpose and it works! The fact that it works and I had great results tops the quality in MY opinion. Hopefully this DVD will deliver great results as well. I was disappointed at the price however...I guess it balance it self out because it's cheaper than a gym membership!",1387411200,4,648,4.150793650793651
