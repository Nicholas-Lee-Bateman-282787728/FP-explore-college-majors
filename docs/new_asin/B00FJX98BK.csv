5994062,5,B00FJX98BK,"Kanako is in the place of her dreams, she is going to the same school as her mother did in order to find her true love.  But unlike her mother who found the prince of her dreams, she is looking for a princess (she is afraid of boys to the point of hives).  But on the first day, she gets lost on the grounds and runs into one who she thinks is the perfect girl for her - until she gets a reaction from her.  Then the same girl ends up being her room mate with her live in maid - sounds good until she discovers ""her"" little secret.  So now Kanako needs to not only keep a secret that could shake up the entire school, fight off the anger of other girls when she gets the attention of the hottest girl in school (and she is sure she is female), and survive the constant nosebleeds she gets seeing all the other attractive girls in several states of undress.  School life is about to get interesting.

I watched this series in orginal dub and it was great.  One of the first series that has a alternate lifestyle main character and her wish to find that happy ending.  Now that it is coming out with an english track i do hope they can keep the same magic the original series had.",1384992000,5,1178,4.091304347826087
8616153,5,B00FJX98BK,I really enjoyed watching this anime.  It was pretty funny at times.  This anime is about a boy who dresses up like a girl and goes to a all girls school.,1489104000,,154,3.935483870967742
8616154,2,B00FJX98BK,"It doesn't say much when the opening credits of the 2nd season are the most entertaining part of the shows.  Kanako is a dim-witted lesbian who transfers to a Catholic girls school.  She accidentally discovers the secret of a rich and pretty freshman girl named Mariya and Mariya makes sure that they are set up as roommates so she can keep an eye on Kanako.  Mariya and her livein maid spend a lot of time insulting and tormenting Kanako, but she kind of has it coming.  About half of each episode is spent in Kanako's twisted imagination where she dreams of romantic encounters with the students and teachers or of seeing them naked.  She launches into a fantasy in just about every scene, so the actual plot of the episodes is hard to follow with the constant distraction.  The fantasies are accompanied by Kanako's loud, shrill, fast speaking, and non-stop commentary just to make them more annoying.  Oh, and the nosebleeds.  Just about every Kanako fantasy results in a big spouting nosebleed from her.  Her classmates constantly have to take her to the nurse's office due to blood loss.  She manages to turn both the swimming pool and the girls' bath red in a couple of episodes.  I didn't find the show to be all that daring, provocative, or even more than mildly funny.  After you've seen the same gag a couple dozen times, you just want to say enough already.",1451001600,,1369,4.634854771784233
8616155,5,B00FJX98BK,Its a little like Girls Bravo only yuri. Its season 1 should be named Kanako Holic in stead.,1435363200,,92,4.166666666666667

8616157,4,B00FJX98BK,"Let's get one thing clear from the start: I *love* Maria-Holic. It's easily one of my favorite anime. With that said, a lot of you out there will hate it intensely, and neither of us are necessarily wrong. As a helpful guide, let me provide the following checklist.

* Do you want to see things turn out well for your love-lorn, good-hearted main character?
* When non-heteronormative cast members (LBGT, cross-dressing, etc.) appear in an anime, do you prefer them to be sympathetic characters?
* Do you hope characters develop morally and emotionally by the end of the show?
* Do you expect a lot of forward plot progression leading to a conclusive finale?

If you feel strongly about a ""yes"" answer for any or all of these points, then do yourself a favor and stay the heck away from Maria-Holic. Don't touch it with a ten-foot pole! If, on the other hand, you're okay with ""no"" answers or can at least brush them aside in the interest of enjoying one of the funniest, most demented black comedies ever committed to animation, you owe it to yourself to give Maria-Holic a try.

It's also critically important that you understand what Maria Holic (MH) is *doing*, as that can make or break the enjoyment of the show. Although it keeps a straight face, MH isn't meant to be taken seriously, because it is a direct parody of the ""yuri (lesbian) schoolgirl romance"" genre. MH starts off looking like a by-the-book entry in that genre, sharing all of its major tropes. Sweet, likeable Kanako Miyame moves to an all-girl's Catholic school in the middle of spring with romance in her heart. We get an idea that something's a little off when she gets cursed out by a maid at the school gate, but then she meets a series of beautiful young girls of various types she's attracted to, and her heart is especially captured by the genteel, petite, and beautiful Maria Shidou. But then Kanako surprises Maria in the dressing room, and everything goes up in flames.

That beautiful girl, Maria, is actually a cross-dressing boy with a Luciferian temper and cruel streak eight miles wide. He declares himself Kanako's roommate (read: jailer/warden) to make sure she keeps his secret. The maid (Matsurika) is Maria's ice-cold familiar and minion. Their dorm leader is an ageless catgirl who fancies herself ""God"" and occasionally seems to be so. Seafood is used as a tool for bullying, some Lovecraftian terror has taken up residence in Kanako's bag... Oh, and Kanako herself? Well, although she's still likeable, it's gradually revealed that she's an insatiably lecherous ""Peeping Pam"" who could give anime's most robust male perverts a run for their money. All of it adds up to a never-ending train wreck of a yuri anime, and enjoyed in that sense, it's one of the funniest things I've ever watched.

Maria Holic also has production values that are out of this world in almost all areas. The art and animation by SHAFT are visually gorgeous and endlessly creative; the show mainly alternates between life-sized and chibi character designs but will swap to many others depending on the moment and mood, including ""action anime,"" stained glass, horror, etc. The music is very appropriate, with emotional piano music for most of the BGM and a fantastic ending song (and animation) in ""Ki Mine Mune Kyun"" that you won't skip often. The voice-acting is also excellent in both the Japanese subtitled and English dubbed tracks; I slightly prefer the sub (unusual for me), but both are very entertaining and well-done.

I really only have two negative things to say about Maria-Holic: it suffers from needless slow-down at points, and there is no plot progression whatsoever. MH catches crap for often being ""an anime about nothing,"" which I think is unfair given how that can be said of almost any cutesy slice-of-life anime on the market. It stays entertaining, but its lack of focus occasionally gets draining. For example, one episode was almost entirely composed of Kanako coming up with conspiracy theories about her seafood-related bullying, and by the time the credits rolled the joke felt thoroughly worn-out. The lack of forward movement in the plot was a bigger annoyance. MH *has* a plot structure, good characters, uneasy relationship tensions to be resolved, mysteries to be revealed... and it refuses to do anything about them. I get that it's a yuri parody, and its disinterest in resolving things may be part of the joke, but I see no reason the writers couldn't have ""had their cake and eaten it, too"" on this. MH would have been just as funny if the story *did* move forward and characters developed and changed, but that isn't the route they chose to go with it.

Again, this is not a show for everyone--*at all*! People of tender sensibilities who get no enjoyment out of watching a dumb main character suffer need not apply, and in fact, you may need to have a slightly demented streak yourself in order to fully enjoy it. If dark humor and high production values are your thing, though, by all means pick this one up.",1428105600,,5020,4.8032407407407405
8616158,3,B00FJX98BK,It was ok,1426982400,,9,2.3333333333333335
8616159,5,B00FJX98BK,"I first watched this years ago in Japanese with English subtitles and loved it. It is rather weird at times and is not an anime that one should ever take seriously. The stories and humor can be absolutely bizarre at times i.e. one of the characters has cat ears and looks like a little girl for no reason and one of the characters always has something that someone is in need of no matter how odd, cumbersome or obscure the item is. The comedy is whacky, slapstick and at times dark and all the characters are well done. I especially liked the maid Matsurika. The dubbing was also well done for the most part. The only characters who's voices I didn't love were Nanami, Sachi and Yozuru.",1410480000,,687,4.417322834645669
8616160,5,B00FJX98BK,"Maria Holic has always been a favorite of mine. When I heard it was getting a Blu-Ray release I was estatic Then I noticed it had a new dub with it and I rocketed through the roof while stars flew out my butt, but there is always that feeling of ""oh crap can the English dub pull through. Well I'm happy to say it did. Jessica Calvello's Kanoko is even funnier at times than Asami Sanada's version. even though Jessica has harder times with the serious scenes this show barely has any sdo it's hard to mark it down. Monica Rahl is brilliant as always pulling off a farily convencing boys voice as Maria and doing an admerable job  with the innocent persona that he uses to get by. But the real surprises are  Caitlynn French as Matsurika and Illich Guardiola as Father Kanae. Who honestly outshine thier Japanese dub counterparts. I implore you to pick this up, if you don't have a blu-ray player your a fool the PS3 has a great one and a stand-alone blu-ray is cheaper than ever. So, buy it... what are you doing BUY IT!",1395360000,2,1021,4.340314136125654
8616161,5,B00FJX98BK,"This show might best be thought of by anime fans as ""Excel Saga 2.0"" as it is just as zany, surreal and at least as fun.  Fittingly, the two main characters of this are voiced by the veteran actresses who voiced the leads in Excel Saga all those years ago and they, in this dub that has been a LONG time coming, hit it out of the park here; Kanako is eerily similar to Excel Excel and is a role that actress Jessica Calvello seems ""born to play"".  Depending upon how closely one follows Sentai dubs one might be wary of Chris Ayres as a dub director, and rightly so, but he delivers a more-than-solid dub here.  This is his best dub to-date.  While the support characters aren't quite matching the pace of the veteran lead actresses in this they aren't trailing by all that much.

(Due to odd circumstances with this release, this bluray has been out for over a month now (albeit not from Amazon) and the dub has been streaming on Anime Network)

This show is purely comedic at heart, though it is a somewhat dark comedy.  Despite the continued theme of light sadism the show always stays more comedic than dark.  In my opinion, the best part of the show was the continuing dynamic between Kanako and Maria.  Unfortunately as the show progresses Maria becomes a bit marginalized as a character (this is, in a 4th-wall-breaking incident, joked about by Maria) and that dynamic is lessened; as the Japanese actors point out, 80% of the lines in the show are Kanako's and that's pretty accurate for both dubs.  I think that the show suffers for it but not enough to warrant a loss of a star.

It should be noted that, in addition to featuring what are essentially a drag queen and a lesbian, this show espouses a narrative about homosexuality that does NOT jibe with the ""Politically Correct"" one that is prevalent in America.  If that might offend you, know that it really only comes up once in the English dub.  Additionally, the show does employ some ""epithets"" to, in a rather ""tough love"" manner, refer to the lesbian character and drag queen.  I commend Chris Ayres and Sentai Filmworks for having the guts to include these in the dub as the show would have felt cheapened had they censored them from the dub.

EXTRAS:
-----------
->Sentai Trailers (So I can't Play H,MEDAKA BOX Abnormal,Girls und Panzer, MM! ; except for the Girls und Panzer trailer, which is dubbed, the rest are just the Textless Openings of their respective shows )

->Japanese Commercials (nothing to write home about, several commercials are essentially the same. They do mention that the Japanese DVD of this features Japanese commentary tracks but they do not appear on Sentai's release. 02:37 runtime)

-> Japanese Promo Video (Slightly humorous but unremarkable.  runtime 2:05)

-> Amenokisaki Holy Night Festival (the Japanese booked a church on Christmas-12/25/08 @ Ivy Hall Aogaku Kaikan Glory Chapel-in a time slot right before an actual religious ceremony was to be held, to run a promo event for this show that involved the cast, series creator and a live rendition of the OP.  Humorous, but mildly sacrilegious.  Subbed, 22:03 runtime.)

->Club AT-X Interview (3 main actresses carrying on good-naturedly while answering stereotypical questions about the show. Offers some humorous insights from the actresses as to how they perceived their, ah, deviant characters. It also reveals that the Japanese recorded this show in group recording sessions.  Far more energetic and entertaining that the usual such Japanese extra but... Surprisingly high video quality for the circumstances and for 12/21/08. run time: 19:20)

The bluray menus are not animated.  The backgrounds are stock stills of the series and the most interaction that comes from the menu is that the menu choices are ""highlighted"" when the player's cursor hovers over them.",1393632000,5,3823,4.85362095531587
8616162,5,B00FJX98BK,"Maria Holic is a sadistic romp over your morals, that won't stop until they're six feet under.

A young girl goes to a Catholic all girls school, just like her mother, who found true love there with her teacher.  Only difference is she's looking for true love among the other female students. Like a shark in a fish school this little lady is is scenting blood.  Unfortunately it's hers, as she fires off gallons of blood from her nose at even the thought of anything sexy.
  She gets a roommate who appears to be everything a young lesbian could desire, beautiful, intelligent, and demure....but may in fact be devil (figuratively). Secrets, plots, and a maid (who might well be a descendant of the original iron maiden), quickly turn the dream of true love into a nightmare of forced servitude.
  Maria Holic despite its seemingly adult nature, is actually light on fan service, as every time something might occur, mount nosebleed erupts in all its fury.
  If your looking for ecchi, this is not for you. If your looking for a twisted good time with the joys of manipulation, and bottomless wells of inventive ways to make someone's life a living hell, this is a great series.",1390521600,6,1179,4.684466019417476
