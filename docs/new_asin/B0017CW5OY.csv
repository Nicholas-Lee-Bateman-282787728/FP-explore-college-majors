8265637,5,B0017CW5OY,"The stereotypical personas of the characters used in the 1980's is brilliant at best. The music in 200 Cigarettes is a great melody of different genres from this period. The film takes place on new years eve.
 Each of the characters cross paths in this mtv movie production. The drama and antedotes make this a feel good film. Some of the more popular actors in the late 1990's were a great asset. My favorite is Christina Ricci!
 Two movies for one is a great buy! To be honest, I haven't watched SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK. More in tuned with 200 cig characters and plot! Thanks, mtv!!! That's when Mtv was really something compared to crap on their station now. Music and video were everything!!!",1304726400,,694,4.588709677419355

8265639,5,B0017CW5OY,"200 cigarettes. 1 carton. Birthday present for Kevin. This movie has a great ensemble cast. It's like a Who's Who in hot young Hollywood. It feels like an 80's movie. It has Martha Plimpton, both Afflecks, Kate Hudson, and Courtney Love looking very 80's and sober. They even mention Reaganomics. Elvis Costello makes a cameo, Dave Chappelle, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Rudd, Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman (who do a pretty good Long Island accent, by way of Ronkonkoma). It's an MTV film, but a whole lot better than Dead Man on Campus.

If you lived through the 80's than I'm sure you'll get a kick out of this retro flick.

Oh yeah, The Sidewalks of New York is pretty good too.",1245801600,2,679,4.603305785123967
8265640,5,B0017CW5OY,"I love this movie.  A brilliant story, fantastic cast, awesome soundtrack...but the real star of the film is the East Village of Manhattan.  Anyone familiar with the area will appreciate the street art and relics like the old junk tower on Ave B.  I've watched this movie several times and enjoy it more with each viewing.  It's really too bad it's out of print because this is really a gem.",1241049600,,391,4.542857142857143
