8129632,5,B000G96ABS,"This is an excellent collection that I highly recommend. You get Deanna at her best in each of these four movies, Cummings is also excellent in ""It started with Eve"" and ""Three Smart Girls Grow Up"". One of my favorites is ""100 Men and a Girl"", here you can really appreciate what a good child actress she was. The acting in ""Three Smart girls"" is great by everyone in the movie.",1406419200,,378,4.338028169014085
8129633,4,B000G96ABS,"Deanna Durbin movies may be cheesy, but her voice makes up for all of it.  She was a beautiful singer.  ""Because"" still sends shivers down my spine.",1370131200,,148,4.444444444444445
8129634,5,B000G96ABS,"Received purchase in a timely manner.  I was a little nervous about purchasing video tapes (just not willing to hand over the bigger bucks for DVDs), but I've watched 2 so far, and they were fine (though one had not been re-wound).",1303516800,,231,4.5
