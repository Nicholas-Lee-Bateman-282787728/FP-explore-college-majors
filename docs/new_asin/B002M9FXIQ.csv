This release is a sampler of the AYNIL set. Personally I found the full AYNIL 5 dvd set a chore to watch. No coherent narrative, messy direction, albeit with some great footage. At least I know where Eric Idle got his ideas for the Rutles interviews in All You Need Is Cash.

But back to this sampler..... I sat through most of it. Certain sections still seemed to go forever, Liberace, Hugh Hefner, Ginger Baker to name a few. Others including the Beatles were given scant regard.

My final bone of contention.... why give this a similar title to the 1968 documentary that Tony Palmer did? I thought I was getting the 1968 film, and perhaps that frustrated me more than anything. Avoid!",1353974400,2,829,4.37012987012987
