4098154,4,B0039UU3KU,"Warner Bros. Pictures/First National Pictures presents ""TWO SECONDS"" (1932) (68 min/B&W) -- Starring Edward G. Robinson, Vivienne Osborne, Guy Kibbee, Preston Foster, J. Carrol Naish, Frederick Burton & Harry Beresford

Directed by Mervyn LeRoy

This early Warner Bros. First National Picture is all Robinson, there's really no other reason to watch it.  It's not a subtle performance by any means.  No, it's like someone zapped him with a cattle prod leaving us with nothing but total frantic energy. As over the top as this could have been I never found myself doubting Robinson, he brought it all off as natural and I don't believe there are many who could have carried this specific performance as realistically as he did.  If you were ever to meet this character then what Robinson gave us is exactly what you would have seen.

""Two Seconds"" is one of Edward G. Robinson's earliest starring films, and it's also one of his best. Robinson believably conveys the downfall of a basically decent, trusting man victimized by circumstances beyond his control, and how those circumstances ultimately destroy him. He commands your attention every inch of the way in this solid drama.

There's a scene at the end of this film that I think you won't soon forget. As La Salle describes Robinson's courtroom speech, ""The thinking is twisted. The passion takes him over the edge. He cracks before your eyes. This is Robinson, the great American actor, in the most intense minutes of his film career. He endows the speech with the shape and size of melodrama, but maintains the precision of a ballet dancer. Remaining true to his core, and so in control, he goes to a deep place, without fear, hesitation or bluffing, using himself unflinchingly. No film star ever looked like Robinson, and it's a beautiful sight to behold.

The great Mervyn LeRoy, who guided Robinson through his breakthrough role in ""Little Caesar"" (1931) a year earlier, handles the sure-footed direction here, and doesn't disappoint.  Edward G. Robinson overacts outrageously throughout Two Seconds, but that's part of the charm of this film rarity.

4098155,4,B0039UU3KU,Love this 1932 proto-noir - Robinson is great! - but I'd like to point out that the picture on the box is from an entirely different movie.,1297900800,3,139,4.185185185185185
4098156,4,B0039UU3KU,"I'm so glad these obscure films are available on DVD, but DON'T buy them at such a ridiculous price.  You can get them for much less by buying directly from the Warner/Turner archive website at a fair price or even do direct download.",1264032000,4,234,4.441860465116279
4098157,4,B0039UU3KU,"Released in 1932, ""Two Seconds"" is a Warner Brother's pre-code gem. Edward G. Robinson plays a nice guy who is set up in marriage by dance hall cutie, Vivienne Osborne. The title refers to the premise that a man's life flashes before his eyes prior to death. In 2 seconds, Robinson recalls the circumstances which brought him to the electric chair.

The film is chock full of nasty characters, sleazy situations and colloquial dialogue. The screenplay was based on a short lived play and the stage roots are evident but there is not a moment of wasted screen time.  Scene after scene contains memorable images - the dance hall where the leads meet, the marriage ceremony with Robinson drunk and Osborne's true nature emerging, the pick-up on the street of 2 prostitutes etc etc. The writing in this one is absolutely outstanding and while Mervyn Le Roy's direction is as featureless as usual for him at this time, the camera is at least on the move.

All the actors are great. Preston Foster plays Robinson's pal, apparently repeating his stage role and he never had such a dynamic part. Osborne was a very experienced stage actress who never reached stardom but she is riveting here. Part of the brilliance of the screenplay is that until the wedding ceremony, the viewer can't be sure that she is not on the level. When her true nature appears, Osborne's vicious outbursts are worthy of Bette Davis. Viewers may recall Osborne's last screen performance as the hypochondriac wife of Vincent Price in ""Dragonwyck"".  The range of these roles indicates that Osborne was a very talented, albeit forgotten, actress.

But towering above these great performances is Edward G. Robinson. His story is a masterpiece of irony and Robinson invests his role with such humanity, such gut-wrenching emotion, one can't fail to be deeply moved. His ""one take"" soliloquy towards the end of the film, when the man dissolves before our eyes, is outstanding. If the film had not been a no frills Warner's production, Robinson might have received an Oscar nomination. He's that good!

The Warner's Archive Collection are no frills releases with unrestored prints and no extras except maybe the original theatrical trailers (not in this case). They're very expensive too. The upside though is that many films are now available which otherwise may be not. Fortunately, in this case, the print, with the exception of one grainy scene in the boarding-house, is very good. In spite of the high price at which the film is available, don't miss it.",1262217600,10,2520,4.903755868544601
8392372,5,B0039UU3KU,"Not a great movie but it held my interest the whole way through.
Made in 1932 this is an early look at the side of Edward G that came through later on
as the psychotic ship captain in Sea Wolf and the gangster in Key Largo.
A very enjoyable movie.",1520294400,,247,3.96
8392373,5,B0039UU3KU,"Edward G. Robinson sets a pretty high bar for all actors who followed this gritty performance. The scenes toward the end of the movie (spoiler alert!) where his mind starts to unravel, and the courtroom scene, left me speechless. I've seen many of his movies up until Two Seconds but this one beats them all for the shear brilliance of his portrayal as a former riveter on the edge of sanity after his life is derailed by a heartless gold-digging tramp, beautifully played by Vivienne Osborne. Hands down one of his best performances!!",1482537600,,535,4.763440860215054

8392380,4,B0039UU3KU,"There's no chance a movie like this is coming out of Hollywood this decade or the previous decade or in the nineties or eighties. Two Seconds is the story of an unhappy steel worker and his squalid little life. At times, Edward G. Robinson is very over the top, but when it matters, his performance is crackling with authenticity and passion and it is clear why this small and unattractive man became a huge Hollywood icon. His fire is undeniable.

Unpredictably plotted in the way many pre-code B pictures were, this piece is always engaging and alive and perhaps a bit too short. It contains an absolutely searing monologue that you will never forget and overall the work is a dirty window through which the desperation of life for the lower class in 1930 American can be gleaned.

A good film and a rich portrait.",1382745600,,816,4.620689655172414
8392381,5,B0039UU3KU,"Edward G. Robinson is practically the whole show, and what a show it is. This is Warner precode drama at its best, and why I never heard of it until I saw it on TCM is a wonder. It's got everything, from the seemingly mismatched roommates, thoughtful John (Edward G. Robinson) and gregarious Budd (Preston Foster), talking about scoring on a date in the most unsubtle of language while riveting on a tall skyscraper, to a barracuda in high heels, Shirley (Vivienne Osborne), who has her eyes on John's $62.50 a week from the start and tailors her act to suit his highest admiration - education and books. She tells John she's working in a dance hall to help support her folks so she can have time to study at night, and even the audience is not sure about her at first, so you're sympathetic with John for him not knowing either. However, it's not just John's steady paycheck Shirley's after. There was one true thing she told John before they were married - she has ambitions. As she tells a broken John later on - in wallet and spirit - ""there are things a Mrs. can get away with that a Miss can't"".

With Mervyn Leroy you'd expect superb direction, and that's what you get. This is so stylishly shot too. Even though there are no expensive sets - after all this is 1932 WB we're talking about - a lot is done with a little. Take the scene in the courtroom with only the sound of a fan at first, Eddie G. in what looks like a spotlight with the rest of the courtroom dark except for the judge's face - we're talking prototype noir here both in substance and style. From the baby face of William Janney that we see in the first frame to that same face full of wonder in the last, this thing is expertly constructed as the flashback of a man about to be executed who has ""two seconds"" to live his life over from the time the electricity floods his body until his brain stops functioning. Highly recommended.

Best precode moment:Shirley has dragged a drunken - but now married - John back to his apartment. Her first act as John's wife is to kick Bud out for good. Before Bud even has packed his stuff and left, Shirley is stripping down to her undies. Mind you, this is a one room flat. You can only assume she is going to consummate this marriage pronto before John has a chance to sober up and cry ""annulment"". As a parting shot of regard Bud finishes a cigarette he is smoking and tosses it on to her already bare back as she is raring to go as soon as Bud is out of the room...that is, I'd assume she'd wait until he left the room! Hot stuff from WB.",1367539200,3,2555,4.276859504132231
