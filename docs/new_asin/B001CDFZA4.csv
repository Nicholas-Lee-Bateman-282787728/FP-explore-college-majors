8326303,1,B001CDFZA4,I bought this and my son never watched it - a waste of money.,1454112000,,61,3.4285714285714284

8326305,5,B001CDFZA4,I give this DVD a 5 rating just for the striking lessons and videos.  I have used this video with multiple teams and players and I have always seen dramatic improvements in their a bilty to strike the  ball with power.  I use the drills in the video and let each player take home the DVD to watch.  The players that truly watch the video then understand what really needs to happen to put power on the ball.  I was able to purchase this video through Amazon very inexpensively and the payback on the pitch has been fun to watch.,1290211200,,528,4.24
8326306,4,B001CDFZA4,"Purchased this for my kids starting soccer and thought it was well planned, easy to follow with several practice opportunites embedded in the video.",1259539200,,148,5.208333333333333
8326307,2,B001CDFZA4,The video was okay at best.  It was not helpful or useful to me at all.  The best information I found was through Google.,1227484800,,121,4.0
8326308,3,B001CDFZA4,"Bought this with ""Championship Soccer Drills"" (highly recommended) and this video is good when you have players still learning ball control (though they do get into some ""fake out"" techniques). Good for rainy day practices in the gym as they do a lot of example in the living room.",1191974400,,281,4.755102040816326
8326309,5,B001CDFZA4,"This is the greatest DVD I have ever seen in training your dribbling abilities. It is short but fun, and is very practical since you basically just need a space of 3ft by 3ft to practice in your living room. Being an amateur soccer player for 13 years with more than 1,000 games experience, I know those tricks will work and fool your opponents.

If you are really serious about improving your soccer control, get this DVD and you will never regret.",1165104000,11,449,4.475609756097561
8326310,5,B001CDFZA4,This video builds on the other series.  It is a short video 34 minutes but is very skill packed your the soccer player. We had to stop the video several times to get the moves correctly before advancing to the next challenge.  I would recommend this video for kids over the age of 10 because they need to have good control of the ball.  This video also gives the player multiple camera angles to watch the move being done correctly.,1165104000,,432,4.375
