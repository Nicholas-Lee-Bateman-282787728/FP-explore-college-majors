8014151,5,B0001LJCX4,"Duncan Renaldo is good, and Leo Carrillo alone is worth the price of admission.

Picture quality is as good as you're likely to find on this old TV show. Among the delights found in this material, the show shot much of its outdoor action at the Iverson Movie Ranch. The rocks and other features of the ranch are showcased beautifully here.

Leo Carrillo is a great historical figure too  and he spells his last name with two ""r's"" even though you see it misspelled all over the place with a single ""r,"" including in some of the Amazon listings. The guy has a famous beach and a bunch of other stuff named after him in Southern California  people should make an effort to get his name right.",1402617600,,690,4.409448818897638

8014155,1,B0001LJCX4,I was so excited to get a collection of Cisco shows I grew up with! And there the excitement ended.... Piss poor video quality (looks like a BAD VHS transfer) and poor audio coming out of the left channel only! Sad...,1279670400,2,217,4.317073170731708

8014157,4,B0001LJCX4,"One of the first to be filmed in color ""The Cisco Kid Collection 2"", featuring Duncan Renaldo as Cisco and Leo Carillo as Pancho, both actors been in the film business for decades ~ once again they fill the bill for a new Western Series for both kids and adults alike.

 Much like it's predecessor, this second collection has many half-hour episodes, from a selection of twenty, that have never seen the light of day ~ the two legendary pair have been on the screen since the early '30s and have sent a positive message on moral and fair play to every wrangler and buckaroo that sat in front of the Big screen and little screen ~ always for the little guy, once they have uncovered a plot or solved the mystery the action comes on strong ~ can remember all the kids in

 the neighborhood saddling up and riding the dusty trails right after watching the weekly program.

 The series star Duncan Renaldo was presented with a ""Special Lifetime Achievement Award from Nosotros"" ~ for providing a positive Hispanic role model for Americans that was certainly well deserved ~ Renaldo always held his head high in every way ~ O. Henry's famous Robin Hood of the Old West, a fictional western character ""The Cisco Kid"" came to life through a weekly series as they clean up a wild town, trailing cattle rustlers and always for the under-dog ~ take notice that all the episodes were filmed in the great outdoors.

 In summary, this classic Western ran from 1950-1956 featuring great action sequences climaxing each story that holds up today as one of our great western heroes ~ once again because of film preservation and this restored DVD, we can escape to the old west and family entertainment ~ was good to see one of my all-time favorite sidekicks Leo Carillo (Pancho), take the english language to another level ~ his famous one liners still ring in my head, and I loved every one of them ~ especially at the end, when both would sing out with ""Oh, Pancho"" and then ""Oh, Cisco"", they'll never be another like the two of them...gotta love it!

 Total Time: 4-DVD-Set ~ MPI Home Video 7570 ~ (3/25/2004)",1090281600,6,2096,4.580213903743315
