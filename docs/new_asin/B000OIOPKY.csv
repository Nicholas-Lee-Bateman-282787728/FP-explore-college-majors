2796820,2,B000OIOPKY,"I can't believe I bought this movie.  It is so retarded.
The kid in the movie is supposed to be this naturally gifted rider with a special bond with a horse.  Well, what you see of his riding skills is sloppy and he looks like he is about to fall off.  The actor is clearly not a rider and did not get very good lessons before filming this movie.
Another thing, if you are a horse person, you will notice all of the equestrian terminology thrown around in this movie, even when what they are talking about is totally unrelated.  For example, in one part the trainer tells the boy he is doing great in ""two-point.""  When they show the kid riding, he's plodding along at a walk, definately NOT in two-point.  This kind of stuff happens throughout the movie.  It's really annoying.
The events in this movie are also very unrealistic.  Who would put a novice rider on a professional racehorse???  That spells disaster, but magically worked out well in the movie.
Lastly, the kid rides a sorrel horse, but the stunt double rides a bay horse in part of the movie.  WOW.  Nice work movie-makers.  Retards.
This movie is okay for people who know nothing about horses, but for those of us who do, it's just a tad bit insulting.  Don't buy it.

And P.S.  Learn how to act people!",1182038400,8,1269,4.4094827586206895

2796848,5,B000OIOPKY,"I won this movie at bingo.  When I watched it, I cried when the old man died.  I'm not a crier at movies.

It was the last movie Billy Preston did.  They filmed near a hospital for his dialysis.  He wrote and preformed three songs, very well.

This was very well done and is for people of all ages.  The scenery is beautiful and there is no cursing or gore.

The extras were a lot of fun and very informative.  It showed there is more to Zac than meets the 'High School Musical' eye...",1329782400,,485,4.074468085106383
2796849,5,B000OIOPKY,"This movie was purchased for my daughter who is totally a Zac fan! She has watched this movie countless times.  This movie is based on Zac Efron's character going after his dreams and in the end, is parents support him!
This is a must see movie for ALL!",1325030400,,253,4.270833333333333
2796850,5,B000OIOPKY,I bought this video after seeing part of it from a borrowed one for my daughter. She was away at a friends and I watched it. Zac Efron is as sweet in this movie as expected and just as talented. Its my daughters movie but if you want a sweet feel good DVD to watch get this one for you. Its good for both kids and adults and that is rare.,1281484800,,338,3.7746478873239435
2796861,2,B000OIOPKY,"We find totally uninspiring characters, a weak plot and some self-conscious acting. It was shot well, but their was no driving force that kept my attention to the screen without reminding me of how much of a cable TV movie this is. I hope this was just made to give Zac Efron a film career because if the writer really felt depth in this script, I would start to lose hope in the future of film.",1277596800,,395,4.2105263157894735
2796862,2,B000OIOPKY,"I hated this movie from the start. The acting is so bad I can't stand it. And don't even get my started on the horses. They used a different horse in almost every scene, one moment the horse has a blaze face and the next, no markings at all. When the actor (zac) was riding it was completely unrealistic. A trained horse will not just buck you off for no reason. And overall it was just an insult to the horse world.",1277337600,,416,4.085365853658536
2796863,1,B000OIOPKY,"As a Zac Efron lover, this movie was a big disappointment.  Very low budget!",1264636800,,76,4.428571428571429
2796864,1,B000OIOPKY,"Sure this movie has a nice message about pursuing your dreams.  But as a lifelong horse show competitor, I was shocked at just how bad this movie was from a horse-knowledge standpoint.  The editing was not consistent... with shots of a bay horse intermingled with shots of a sorrel in the same sequence.  They didn't even really try to match the two sorrels they used for the primary horse, ""Rusty.""  Furthermore, Rusty is NOT a stallion, though that is never referenced during the movie.  The young man playing the arch-nemesis of the movie was a train-wreck in the saddle in the one shot that showed the kid on board an actual horse.

Riding instructions from the mentor ""Houston"" are contradictory.  At one point, he tells the young star to use his ""full seat"" while riding two-point.  NOT possible.  In addition, he refers to Zac Efron's character as the ""most natural rider he's ever seen.""  Efron wasn't completely terrible in the saddle, but it's pretty clear he doesn't have much, if any, experience riding.

The climax of the movie-- the steeplechase-- was yet another demonstation of poor and inconsistent editing.  There were shots of various horses, from various events, grouped together in a pitiful attempt to appear as though it is one race.

This movie reminded me of all those really bad horse movies that Hollywood made 20+ years ago.  If you have any knowledge of horses and riding, you may find yourself too frustrated by all of the inconsistencies and downright errors that you may be unable to enjoy the story.",1262908800,6,1532,4.819923371647509
2796865,5,B000OIOPKY,"very good, family film. It's good to see the chemistry between the actors come to life and make it more believeable. Good casting. i would recommend this film to all my friends and their family to watch it for a family night together.",1252800000,3,234,4.465116279069767
2796866,5,B000OIOPKY,"This is a very sweet movie. It is a simple story about teen years, but I think that it really delivered on how sometimes parents try to live thru there children.
  The music at the end is really a GREAT song.  I wish that they would have put it throughout the movie.  Billy Preston really was one of the Greats!!!",1252713600,2,313,4.166666666666667
2796867,4,B000OIOPKY,"I bought this movie for my Zac Efron loving 8 yr old and thought it would be watched once and forgotten.  Instead it's a nice story for young kids and you can see the budding talent of Efron, he's kind of a natural.  It's a lot like the other movie he made called Miracle Run that shows he possesses a nice persona on film, and even with the gap in his teeth was a nice looking young man.  My daughter enjoys this movie, though our version has a horse on the cover and not the smiling photo of Zac.  If your daughter is a fan of Zac Efron it's not a big investment for your child to see him in an earlier work with no singing, dancing or Sharpay.",1246233600,2,646,3.9844961240310077

2796870,5,B000OIOPKY,"If I walked into my house and moments later a wall of nuclear flame from an exploding star ripped through the walls and I could save only one DVD, it would be this one. I would quickly fetch the DVD, then enter a galactic hibernation chamber knowing full well that everything I knew and loved was about to disappear. Perhaps other survivors and I would congregate in a distant solar system after our computerized navigation systems coordinated a rendezvous.

A new world awaits for all of us. My new world may be in a space bubble far away where others and I try to remember what it means to be human. Why are we still alive? Has Linda McCardle had plastic surgery? Does Jim McCardle try to look like a dufus or is his appearance an inextricable part of his self? Is Randy's hairstyle absolutely stupid or are all perceptions relative? Is life in outer space worth living?

When you are done reading this review, you will probably watch this movie with your friends and family, eat popcorn and drink carbonated beverages. As you press play on the remote control, take a moment to think about exploding stars.",1232928000,3,1108,4.590909090909091
2796891,1,B000OIOPKY,"Just another Cheezy kid's movie.
Non realistic at all.
A boy does not learn how to race a horse let alone ride a horse in less than a week.
Crappy ending.",1232150400,,154,4.0
2796892,1,B000OIOPKY,"This was a really poorly-made movie.  We appreciate the fact that we only borrowed it from the library and didn't spend money on it.  We are also happy that we don't have to hide it from younger viewers.

Maybe it is just that we have sophisticated taste.  First of all, the movie was just poorly directed, as the story line was gentle and probably could have passed as a good film.  Some of the actors had potential, but the lines were weak, and in many cases, very random to the scenes.  The lighting was also very poor.  Often, the focus was poor as well, and many times it was hard to define the objects or people in the scene, or what was happening in the scene.  In certain situations, the words being said seemed to have been duped in, and would come after the character had turned their back on the camera.

Some examples of discrepancies were when the main actor, named Patrick, met the new girl named Jill.  He invited her to a barbecue, and she knew nobody else there.  However, as his parents are visiting with the actor named ""Houston"", Jill walks up and links her arm into Patrick's mother's arm--like they have been very close for a long time.  In various scenes, as Patrick is learning to ride, or even when he is just walking the horse on lead, the film is suddenly in slow motion.  In one particular scene, the camera switches between Patrick and the horse, and Patrick's father visiting with Houston, the scene being ""normal speed"" when they show Houston and the father, but then is back in slow motion when they show Patrick riding again.  As a viewer, I got the impression that the person filming (or possibly editing) is trying out new techniques with very little experience.

We actually found that we only kept watching to find out at first if it would get better, and later, just to laugh at the antics and attempts made by the actors, directors and editors.

Having said all that, I appreciate that they were trying to make a good family movie that eliminated the need to cover your small children's eyes or ears.  However, in most cases I find it hard to believe that it would retain the interest of a child over the age of 7 or 8 years old.  Our children range in age from 3 to nearly 20, so it is not a particularly interesting movie all of our family could enjoy.  Classics like ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", ""Sound of Music"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"" or ""Wizard of Oz"" can entertain our whole family.  This type of movie just can not.",1213488000,,2467,4.44
2796893,5,B000OIOPKY,"I haven't viewed it yet, but my 9-year-old daughter said it's her ""Favorite movie ever!""",1200182400,3,88,4.933333333333334
2796894,4,B000OIOPKY,"Bought this for our 2-year-old who is horse crazy, and turns out the whole family enjoyed watching it.  Just a feel good movie in which a boy endures trials and triumphs on his way to success.  Good messages for kids of all ages; even my 13-year-old said it wasn't bad, and our 9-year-old really liked it too.",1200009600,5,309,4.4035087719298245
2796895,4,B000OIOPKY,It's a cute family movie. It's gets predictable in places but still a good message for young viewers. I like this movie and it's a good family night movie for family's with young children.,1192060800,2,188,4.5588235294117645
2796896,1,B000OIOPKY,I would've given this 0 stars if I could have. If your looking for a solid low budget film you have found it. Don't waste your time on this movie.  The filming was comical for the fact it was so lousy!  I would've rather spent my time watching the grass grow in my back yard!,1191542400,,275,3.981818181818182
2796897,4,B000OIOPKY,"15-year old Patrick (Zac Efron) is new in town and has problems:  He can't please his jock father and he runs afoul of the local teen bully who likes the girl Patrick likes.  His only friend is a one-time horse trainer and long-time alcoholic (Bill Cobbs), who sees something special in the boy and gives him a horse.

There's no denying Efron's Tiger Beat-cuteness, and he does a fine job in an undemanding role, but if you want to see a real actor, take a look at Bill Cobbs.  He's been playing small character parts in TV and movies for years, but this time he's the star and absolutely owns the screen.  His craggy face and gravelly voice masterfully express the only real emotion in the film and he's a pleasure to watch.

Adults may find the story predictable and a bit bland, but the wholesome message about finding your passion and working hard for it makes ""The Derby Stallion"" just right for family viewing.",1186617600,8,917,4.527272727272727

2796899,4,B000OIOPKY,"With all the junk out there, it's nice to watch a movie with such positive values and one which can be shared with the whole family. Zac Efron is endearing -- it's not surprising he has soared to stardom in ""High School Musical."" And Bill Cobbs as the wise old horseman is great. I loved the mentor chemistry between them. There is a lot to like in this movie and I recommend it heartily.",1182729600,11,388,4.256756756756757
2796900,3,B000OIOPKY,"The Derby Stallion could have been done alot better. It appeared to be a very low budget film. Its about this boy who decides he wants to ride steeplechase and convinces his parents to allow him to. The riding was very sloppy and some of the sences of him first riding were un realistic and alot of it was put into slow motion, like when he was first learning to jump. The two horses that played in the movie were also two completley different colors. The movie idea was good, but they could have spent more time on teaching the actor to ride and handle horses instead of what appeared to be a very rushed movie. Not a good choice for people who know a thing or two about horses.",1182556800,5,679,4.230769230769231
8185267,5,B000OIOPKY,"This movie stands out as the most bizarre performance of Efron ever made, but mostly the story line being so far from reality that I consider it a Cult Classic.  I put this movie on par with any movie made today, that is pure insanity.  This is the Sharknado of its genre.  The greatest scene is the girl and the old mans pillow.",1481500800,,329,4.190476190476191
