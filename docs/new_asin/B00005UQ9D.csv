1667926,1,B00005UQ9D,"Both franchises are very different even though there has been times when both have dabbled in each other's space genre. Star Trek is about human history stemming from Earth. Our Earth. In the year 24whatever. Star Wars is about human's that are not from Earth but inhabit basically a parallel universe to ours where human's apparently never came from Earth (at least I haven't heard any story treatments of Star Wars addressing this). In Star Wars humans are every bit as alien as the weirdest alien George could come up with. In Star Trek humans are discovering their galaxy every year. In Star Wars humans travel throughout their galaxy far, far away in a time long ago. Apparently humans in Star Wars existed long before humans in Star Trek. And maybe someone could possibly come up with a story about how human history in the Star Wars galaxy and human history in the Star Trek galaxy are linked. But then again Star Trek has its own history all the way back to the Big Bang. And (even though I'm not an expert in Star Wars) Star Wars probably has its own too (all the way back to the Big Kablooey, or whatever its called in the Star Wars universe). Not only different galaxies, but different universes. Nay, different realities. So why compare them when they most certainly do not occupy the same space (literally and figuratively)? Yes, compare them to all the space franchises that take from them and existed before them. Compare Star Wars to Starship Troopers. Compare Star Trek to Alien, Aliens, et al. On second thought, compare Star Wars to sci-fi franchises that aren't set in Earth's past, present or future. I'm not sure what that would be though. But I'm sure it would be more of a fantasy type sci-fi franchise than something closer to our own reality.",1009584000,13,1768,4.669871794871795

7955328,4,B00005UQ9D,To me there is room for both in the sci-fi world.  All this bickering and fighting is irrational.  But it is good to see how they both historically have evolved and to learn some of the ins and outs of how both came to be the big draw that they are today.,1413936000,,255,3.8846153846153846

7955330,1,B00005UQ9D,"This documentary provided nothing new: no fresh interviews, no insightful information and no non-stock footage of the characters, directors and writers. I take that back. There were several original shots of long lines outside of movie theaters, taken by an obvious amateur videographer. Sadly, this is the only documentary that covers a very deep and worthwhile topic. For its lack of professionalism, the flick did raise some interesting questions, such as why hasn't Star Wars made it on the television and Star Trek has? That is very important now that George Lucas recently announced plans for a Star Wars tv series. Perhaps, a real documentary team will give this topic the attention it deserves.",1199318400,6,702,5.166666666666667
7955331,2,B00005UQ9D,Unless you are a true fan it's not worth owning. There are some redeemimg qualities but it is poorly done.,1197244800,3,106,4.35
7955332,2,B00005UQ9D,"Whether there is genuinely a rivalry between fans of Star Trek and Star Wars productions or whether they're actually mostly the same people, as I suspect, you won't get much of a sense of it from watching Star Wars vs. Star Trek: The Rivalry Continues.

I'm a fan of Star Trek and will watch anything Paramount offers that is even vaguely related to the Enterprise, Starfleet or Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future universe. I've never seen a Star Wars movie, although I admit to trying to watch one once. For me, there is no rivalry. Star Trek wins hands down. Still, I thought an examination of the perceived rivalry would be entertaining.

While the 50-minute documentary includes some interesting interview snippets and a couple of Star Trek bloopers, there is very little real content. A few fans of the two franchises are interviewed, but producers managed to gather no truly insightful or entertaining comments. The production's key question, ""Is there a rivalry between Star Trek and Star Wars fans?"", goes mostly unanswered.

The documentary's biggest problems are technical, however. Once viewers get past the stuffy announcer, very poor quality video makes the production look even worse than it really it. The images of Star Trek's original series are blurry bootlegs, while almost all other images are from trailers and press photos. Sloppy editors even show a nice head shot of DeForest Kelley to introduce an interview soundbyte from Star Trek guest actor Michael Forest.

On my DVD player, the documentary starts playing immediately upon inserting the disc. I only learned about the menu and special features later. Short additional interview material is unintentionally humorous, from a confused Carrie Fisher being interviewed in English and Spanish at the same time to an ultimately useless interview (from the late 1970s but strangely in black and white) with an arrogant William Shatner that fades away mid-sentence. Amateur footage from the opening of the Star Trek Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and some Star Wars fan footage that I didn't bother to watch are also included.

True devotees of either franchise need to see this DVD so they can write humorous and biting blog and message board posts about it. Otherwise, boldly go elsewhere.",1192492800,,2271,5.094086021505376
7955333,1,B00005UQ9D,"come on don't waste your time . being a fan is one thing,but this is too much.",1105574400,3,78,3.6470588235294117
7955334,2,B00005UQ9D,"If you're a fan of either series, then guess what? You're a geek, just like me. If you're arguing over which is better, however, you are a looser. Big difference.
To get into the nuances of either series would take forever, but the concept of compairing these two is silly. First of all, any preferece would be a matter of opinion. If you like big explosions and an almost western style of Good vs. Evil, you would tend toward Star Wars. If you like a more technical delivery of tougher moral choices, Star Trek is your game. Compairing them because they both have ""star"" in title is ridiculous at best, as they are in very different sub-genres. It would be like ""Star Man"" vs. ""Star Search"".
Star Wars is a space opera, and is comperable to Dune or Battlestar Galactica, two sources Lucas has admitted to drawing heavily from. Star Trek falls into a military sci-fi, and is best compaired to Babylon 5 or Andromeda. A clear case of apples and oranges, it makes as much sense as compairing ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" with ""Moulin Rouge"".
In short, get a life.",1064102400,65,1064,4.489690721649485
7955335,1,B00005UQ9D,"Anybody who wants to 'dis' either series needs to get a life. Both have major entertaining values and is just a matter of personal opinion. I personally prefer Star Trek because it is more scientifically acurate, however Star Wars is a lot of fun. The point being IT DOESN'T MATTER! But onto the review of this dvd, It is just some schmuck's way of getting a quick buck off of die hard fans of one or the other (just like this latest Jason vs. Freddie Movie). The technical side of this movie is just so bad, that unless your into home movies, I wouldn't have spent a dime on it (and didn't since I returned it and got a refund).",1061251200,21,629,4.25
