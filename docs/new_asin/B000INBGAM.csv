2659200,4,B000INBGAM,"This was surprisingly chock full of information about the Holidays.
I didn't want to stop watching it.
It not only tells about Christmas but other traditions associated for that time of year.
Hannukah, Epiphany, Kwanza, Etc....
I think its a good bye.",1201392000,,251,5.0
8146489,3,B000INBGAM,Add me to the list of people this DVD won't work for. My DVD player can't read it at all. I'm very disappointed! I'm giving it 3 stars because I rented it from the library and know that I love it. I just wish my copy would work!,1481846400,,228,3.7708333333333335
8146490,5,B000INBGAM,The stories are great! It is easy to watch each day and can be done in about 5 minutes a day. The other activities on the disc are a nice bonus as well.,1481760000,,152,3.6363636363636362
8146491,1,B000INBGAM,"I can not get it to play in any of our three DVD players, nothing will open when it's placed in any of our computers.  Not happy!",1480291200,,129,3.7777777777777777
8146492,1,B000INBGAM,"All it shows when I put it in to dvd players to play is Disc not Found. Sent it back and got another couple of weeks later, and it does the same thing. I was disappointed.",1458172800,,171,3.7777777777777777
8146493,5,B000INBGAM,Love all the information it gives in such a short time. It does seem to be over my 4 year olds head. He is excited to watch it and wants to repeat them all. My 7 year old loves it. They both would watch every single one every night if i let them. (Actually I probably would too if we had the time ) I love the short 3 minute segments.  Makes it possible to squeeze it in every night.,1449792000,,383,3.7875
8146494,5,B000INBGAM,This is the best programI have ever seen on Advent and Christmas.  It's for all ages!!,1446508800,,86,4.375
8146495,5,B000INBGAM,"Our family is enjoying this DVD calendar together this Advent season. All of our children (all boys) are grown - our youngest a senior in high school - but all still live at home. I wanted to find an Advent calendar like this one that would appeal to them, serving to bring us together as we prepare the Christmas season. These daily stories are very quick yet packed full of information that can be elaborated if desired. I have to smile... We've had longer readings together in the past, kids got anxious - sometimes it was hard to get everyone on board every night - including the years we used Advent chocolates or toys. Sometimes it took a bit of creativity to keep my boys interested. I haven't seen that at all with this Advent calendar. Everyone is ready and waiting promptly at 9pm in our family room every night. Sometimes our discussions have gone on until 10pm - bedtime at hour house. I've never seen my guys so involved and interested in celebrating Advent. Well done. I've found myself reviewing these and doing extra reading just to be more informed... Thank you!",1417910400,,1079,4.595854922279793
8146496,5,B000INBGAM,"I bought this video to use at an Inter- generational Advent Workshop at my church. It is broken down for daily use.  I chose the sessions that tied directly with the craft projects I  procured for the families and children to do.  The parents enjoyed the history and it was clear and interesting enough to capture the children's  interest.  I was so pleased that  I watched it myself even tough I do not have  children at home, and next year I will  use other segments and match craft to the them.  The Video is easy to use in this way as it comes with a full written script.  I would recommend this to anyone who does Advent activities with their family.  It would be great educational family time.",1389312000,,699,4.3828125
8146497,5,B000INBGAM,We've had this DVD for a few years now. Our boys are 10 and 7. We look forward to watching this every December! It's perfect for busy families (and for moms like me that never have enough time to prepare an advent lesson of my own!),1320537600,,232,4.065217391304348
8146498,4,B000INBGAM,"You'll get the history of the candy cane, the history of the wreath, the history of Santa Claus, history of Hanukkah, history of Kwanzaa, the story of how Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer was written and much, much more in the video presentations.  To hold a child's attention, I think it is better geared for maybe ages 6 and older clear up to ADULTS.  Although it has a definite conservative Christian bent to the 3 - 4 minute presentations, it is by far better than any ""candy"" advent calendars. I bought it for my two little nieces (ages 4 and 10 - one Catholic and one Jewish) and found it to be both interesting and educational, and my adult non-religious sister wants a copy for herself for next year.",1264723200,2,706,4.5078125
