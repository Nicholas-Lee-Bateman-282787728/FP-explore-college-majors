3171763,4,B0017HGHG6,"This film is a wonderful tribute to classic science-fiction films such as Fire Maidens From Outer Space, Prehistoric Women and countless other movies from the heyday of the Hayes Office. It was a glorious time when young men flocked to movies like this because seeing an animal-skin clad cutie with fully exposed calves was the biggest thrill a young man could expect, since sex would not be discovered until 1964 with the invention of Raquel Welch (citation needed).

As a piece of entertainment, the movie is amusing enough, but it is educational as well. Auteur Christopher R. Mihm is to be commended for his commitment to showcasing the monotony of long-haul space-travel and military service. The historical aspects of the film have not been neglected, with clear parallels between the two tribes of cave women and the conflict between Neanderthals vs. Cro Magnons vis a vis the relative advancement of their clothing and weapons.

The film's only real flaw lies in its failure to showcase any actual caves. There is not one bit of evidence that the ""cave women"" in this movie actually live in caves.

Seeing this film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it. The black-and-white cinematography has not aged as color would. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of Cave Women on Mars is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is that the government is protecting us.

Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that its a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both story and saga.

To watch it, is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, and gotten away with them.

3171777,3,B0017HGHG6,"Although I am generally a fan of Christopher R. Mihm's oddball sci-fi spoofs (my favorite is the truly hilarious ""Attack of the Moon Zombies""), this outing wasn't quite as enjoyable as most of the series. The film has a very simple plot: two astronauts from Earth land on Mars in the future of 1987 and immediately find themselves in the middle of a clash of two matriarchies (basically four women: two in white, two in black). Amid much drama love flourishes. That's it. OK, maybe that's a bit of a generalization, but you get the premise and why it's such a treasure trove for a Mihm spoof.

Captain Jackson (Mihm regular Josh Craig, seen here in a dual role!) is the steely commander with the Shatnerian diction, and Lieutenant Elliott (Daniel Sjerven) is the astronaut with eyes for a Martian woman. I absolutely loved the helmets the astronauts wore when they started exploring the landscape; it turns out Mars looks a lot like Maple Grove, Minnesota and has breathable air, which makes the astronauts get down to their jumpsuits in a hurry. There are some nice touches of parody here, like the ship's computer that says ""Working"" when it's processing. (Gene Roddenberry would doubtlessly be proud.) While out exploring Elliott hears a call for help and immediately gets captured by two hotties who are wary (""You will not enchant me with your black magic!"") There is a ton of exposition about the clashes of the Martian women, their lack of exposure to love (""A woman without love is an empty animal, indeed.""), and an unbelievably great monster that makes the entire film worthwhile. Ultimately there's lots of melodrama, some hilarious matte paintings of the galaxy to gaze upward at, and of course a bad case of love festering between Elliott and a Martian, even though she's technically human...look, it's kind of complicated: just watch the high priestess monologue for clarification. Will love prevail? I won't spoil the ending, but I bet you can guess.

The DVD, typical of Mihm, has a number of extras, and they are mostly entertaining. The commentary is very interesting and gives great insight into budget filmmaking; there were points where I actually thought the commentary was more interesting than the film, so maybe that's a mixed blessing. There are two separate introductions to the film on display, and the one I recommend to you is from Mihm himself, where he discusses sexism and sci-fi allegories in the genre. The blooper reel is very long and intermittently amusing, though it grows tiresome occasionally. The special effects feature was great, and well worth watching (low budget movies are marvels of creativity!) I especially liked how they shot the ""overlooking the valley"" sequence. There is an alternate scene which contains a huge load of even more exposition: feel free to skip it. There are also trailers, previews, and a photo gallery, all of which are worth seeing.

I had a hard time rating ""Cave Women on Mars"", finally settling on three stars. It's not without its charm and fun moments, but there is a huge amount of walking around in the woods, and the pace is plodding. It does summon up the feel of a 1950's sci-fi stinker, but not as well of some of Mihm's other films: if you are new to Mihm this is definitely not the place to start but loyal fans will feel rewarded.",1452470400,5,3317,4.815789473684211

8265951,3,B0017HGHG6,"This review is for the standard DVD version of Cave Women on Mars released in 2008.

A warning to anybody reading this. This movie is a parody of old movies and is a tribute movie. It is intended for fans of old science fiction movies who want a good laugh. I mention this because I've seen some reviews of other tribute movies that people buy and give one star because they don't realize this.

I'm giving this movie 3 stars because it is not as good as some of the other movies by Christopher Mihm. I started by watching 'The Spider' and that one sort of spoiled me. I thought that movie was terrific. But that is a later release and most likely had a bigger budget. This is the 3rd movie by the director in this series.

I love these tribute movies of old 50's science fiction. This movie does a great job of making fun of old movies. The dialogue and the acting is spot on.

The problem with this movie is not that there is anything wrong with what is here. It's what is not here that is the problem. At times it feels as if the whole movie was filmed in one place. Of course this is not the case. The movie opens in a rocket ship and the two astronauts land on Mars. From here we have a barren rocky are followed by the 'woods' and then more 'woods' and then more 'woods'.
I'm not sure if not having a cave in the movie was intended or not. In the movies that are being parodied there are caves with women. Perhaps this is a joke I'm not getting. There are only two astronauts on board which you don't see often. Most movies from the 50's have more than two. Off the top of my head the only one I can think of without more is 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars.' Since this is also on Mars, I suppose that could be the inspiration. Though they did have a monkey too!

Anyway, this movie could have used more variety. There are only two actresses in each of the warring tribes along with the two astronauts and one beast.

One other note. These movies should be watched with the subtitles on because there is some funny stuff in them that you would miss without having them turned on.",1515974400,,2078,4.1825

Mihm's CAVE WOMEN ON MARS (2008), it's 1987, and spaceship MARS 1 lands on the red planet, finding, in addition to a barren desert, an abundance of plant and animal life! While Captain Jackson and Lieutenant Elliott (Josh Craig and Daniel Sjerven) explore their strange surroundings, Elliott enters a martian forest area, and encounters the warlike females of the title. He quickly discovers that there are two rival tribes, and is captured by one of them. Tromping through the woods, Elliott helps Eina (Brooke Lemke), one of his captors, to defeat a go-rilla-like monster. This causes the first faint notes of love's sweet song to play for Elliott and Eina. Elliott is soon taken to the mystical High Priestess (Stephanie Mihm), where he is shown his true destiny!
