This is a sweet little movie for kids about siblings getting along, being honest with parents, and helping eachother acheive a goal....great for the family!",1384732800,,310,4.553571428571429

8470434,5,B005FQ1OP4,"We happened to catch this and record it in 2010.  My kids (then 6, 4, and 3) watched it over and over.  They begged to watch it again this year (2011), but I couldn't find it on TV.  We know nothing about Build-a-Bear, and you don't need to in order to love this movie.  It has appeal to both boys and girls, and doesn't have some of the scary elements (Winter Warlock and Abomibible Snowman) that some of the other shows do.  It also has a catchy song that our 7-year-old boy likes to ""perform.""  Fun for the whole family!",1323820800,5,523,4.18
8470435,5,B005FQ1OP4,"Really enjoyed watching this animated Christmas movie with the family.  It's a colorful, original story from the folks at Build-A-Bear Workshops -- the animal character plush retailer that kids just can't seem to get enough of! (I've got the credit card receipts to prove it!)  If you're looking for a fun, wholesome holiday-themed adventure for the kids to enjoy this holiday season -- Holly and Hal Moose will make the perfect gift!",1321401600,,434,5.013888888888889
