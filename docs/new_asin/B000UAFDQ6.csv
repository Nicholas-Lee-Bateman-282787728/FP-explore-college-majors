2918144,3,B000UAFDQ6,"The first thing that comes to mind with this movie is that gigantic spiders like the ones on the cover do not appear. The spiders are, obviously, gigantic by spider standards but they are smaller than humans.

A few things happen when people begin to encounter the spiders and something is usually happening in terms of plot. It's not the repetitive ""monster(s) appear, someone dies/disappears, monster(s) vanish, survivors have no idea what happened, repeat"" formula seen in a lot of other movies.

2918145,1,B000UAFDQ6,"What can be said about movies that deal with nature biting back?  Writers should seriously think about ideas before spending five minutes to write a movie and hoping that viewers won't want to demand their money back.  I'm a fan of science fiction.  Arachnophobia...original, Tarantula...interesting, Eight Legged Freaks...hilarious.  But mixing genetic research and spiders, just doesn't mix, unless you want to make another Spider-Man.  This movie is in a long line of straight to DVD releases about the ramifications of playing God with nature, and fails miserably.  The special effects of the movies about spiders back in the 50s and 60s were 10 times better as well as the acting.  I laughed more when I should have jumped with fright.

2918257,3,B000UAFDQ6,"Generally, I like this movie. However, every time I watch it I can't stop thinking about how good it COULD have been. I really like the spiders. They are obvious CG creations, but their bright colors are so garish against the snow covered backdrop that they really hold the viewer's attention and keeps one's interest. Because of their cool factor that somehow makes their toony appearance OK, even for someone like me who is not a fan of badly done digital monsters. Then again, despite being obvious, the CG is still better than a lot of stuff I've seen.

The movie has plenty of action, but the problem is that there's no energy injected into any of the scenes. Everyone just seems to be going through the motions without infusing the proceedings with any life. A major reason scenes seem rather flat is because the music present is one of the most drab scores ever committed to film. Not only does every piece of music sound like a loop that has been included with a music editing program, but it's very subtly played over the action without any bombast whatsoever.

Yes, the movie does plod along, but if the viewer just wants to watch a bunch of giant multicolored spiders attacking people, and can forgive the pacing issues and terrible score, then it's not a bad watch on a lazy day or night.

2918262,2,B000UAFDQ6,"This film stars Vanessa Williams, but not THAT Vanessa Williams. It stars someone else named Vanessa Williams and not the one who sang the ""Colors of the Wind"" song and was on ""Ugly Betty"". That little nugget of information aside, ""Ice Spiders"" concerns the goings-on at a ski resort that also happens to share property with a secret government facility that is trying to genetically engineer giant spiders for use in military applications (apparently, as many a bad sci-fi film will attest to, we have learned that the government is constantly spending money on trying to make giant versions of otherwise normal animals. The military doesn't spend money on lasers, bullets, missiles, tanks, planes or helicopters anymore - no, it's giant spiders, scorpions, snakes, alligators, sharks or octopi.) For reasons best known only to the highest brass in military intelligence, these giant mutations are guarded by the very worst the military has to offer and the biggie-sized creatures promptly escape and proceed to go on a rampage, thereby providing us with a movie full of inept reactions to giant CG critters.

No need to fear, though... When the military fails to reign in their wacky science projects, the resistance movement to the giant ""Ice Spider"" invasion is led by none other than Not-That-Vanessa-Williams (who does not get naked) and our other lead character: `Dash' Dashiel. Yesh, hish name ish `Dash' Dashiel. `Dash' is a former Olympic-caliber skier who, due to a knee injury, now teaches skiing at the resort (presumably, a fate shared by most has-beens and never-weres from the Olympics.) As is expected, his chance at redemption comes later in the film when he has to out-ski various renegade spiders that are out to make a meal of random resort-goers. Honestly, there's not much that happens in this film besides various resort-goers being terrorized by giant spiders that pick them off as they come down the slopes (apparently, no one seems too fazed by giant spiders on the ski slopes - judging by the amount of skiers that happen to just ski right into the maw of a giant spider.) Oh, and it's probably a good time to mention that this film features barely passable CG, so a good amount of laughter comes from seeing horribly rendered giant spiders jump on entirely clueless skiers.

Anyways, the hapless/hopeless army guys of this film proceed to not really control the problem despite superior firepower and it's up to the ski team -  led by `Dash' -  to save the day in a highly unlikely fashion. This little underdog moment could be the film's comment that sheer ingenuity and guts will win out over adversity as opposed to superior firepower and the full support of the U.S. military and science community, but that's assuming this film has some sort of purpose other than showcasing crappy computer animation. Mostly, I think this sociological comment is an accidental side effect from the writers spending only about 20 minutes crapping out this screenplay (after all, they say that enough monkeys locked in a room with typewriters will eventually type out the complete works of William Shakespeare. Personally, I don't really care for a monkey's regurgitation of the Bard - however, I am interested in viewing a simian's take on ""Ice Spiders""! Maybe some Giant Apes will show up and wreck shop on a few Ice Spiders... Maybe the Giant Apes win the war against the Ice Spiders by hurling feces, eating bananas and wearing cute little diapers that make them look a little more human... Who knows? I'm just saying it'd probably be more interesting than what they did end up going with.)

This film features a highly-annoying kid who attends the ski resort to practice for the Olympics. He's cocky and a real jerk, however, he is never eaten by spiders - which makes the movie kind of a wash, as these kind of characters only exist solely to be eaten by ice spiders. To have this type of character survive is a giant middle finger to the audience, but again, it's a movie about ice spiders. What kind of payoff can you expect that asks you to believe that a giant military research facility is right next door to a highly popular ski resort? It's like building an amusement park right in the middle of a former nuclear test site - sure, it's primo land and you can get it for a song, but having the bulk of your park attendance go home with radiation poisoning is probably PR suicide.... But I digress...

The ice spiders are eventually caught and/or destroyed, but not before several secondary characters get killed by them. The movie ends with no real logical explanation of what the spiders would be used for (according to the movie, they would be deployed in Iraq... but that's about as far as it goes towards an explanation. Adapting the spiders to the cold seems unnecessary considering the abundant lack of ice, snow and heavily-occupied ski resorts in Iraq. Really, it makes me wonder how much research the military does before blowing gobs of taxpayer money on ridiculous defense measures.) Also unclear is how the spiders escaped the military installation in the first place as well as exactly how they survive the immense cold. The movie also makes a big deal about a giant frost warning, but most of the characters run around in ski pants and t-shirts... except for the military dudes - they run around bare-chested in bulletproof vests (sort of like refugees from bad mid-80's power rock bands), so really, no one seems too worried about the bitter cold and it doesn't really seem to matter. The movie ends with some odd flirting between 'Dash' and Not-That-Vanessa-Williams and, even though more than half of the resort was eaten, everyone's in a good mood and our two main characters plan a romantic date. Many laughs ensue and the filmmakers wrongfully assume that there's a desire for an ""Ice Spiders"" sequel.

The End.",1302480000,,5859,4.847152847152847
2918263,1,B000UAFDQ6,"About 10 minutes in I was debating whether to keep watching and 15-20 minute in, I was this close to trashing it right there and then *shows the distance between index and thumb*.

The sole purpose of watching these kind of movies is because I'm curious when it comes to weird creatures and I'd like an interesting story to go along with it. Watching this movie is boring because the spiders are nothing new and the story and plot is nothing worth noting.

Plot and POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!

Large Killer Spiders....Bunch of Lame Brains Which Includes A Small Class of Kids That Use Words Like *Totally* and *Awesome*....Government Conspiracy with Mad Scientists for Profit....Death and Gore.

From the title ""Ice Spiders"" I actually thought the spiders were made out of ice and therefore thought it would be interesting to watch. HOWEVER, they're just your typical spiders blown up. It was just boring, there was no real humor to back it up nor an interesting UNIQUE storyline or twist to keep me awake. It was just a lame movie about people getting attacked by large spiders. There was no suspense, not much of a thrill, and my first purpose of why I watch movies like this totally dashed and trashed.

I don't care that this movie was a low budget movie or whatever it is, they could have easily made it up with an interesting story. This is what happens when things are created by people that have little or no motivation towards what they're doing. Settling on mediocrity will be the doom of us all, hence me not going to watch a movie in the theater for over 4 years now.

Like the others have said, it's filled with your typical B movie flaws such as bad acting, casting, corny lines, and cliche to the death. It had a really lame happy ending where all the survivors walk off in a happy, carefree mood, totally forgetting that they lost most of their friends and the people at the ski resort.

2918277,2,B000UAFDQ6,"It's probably my gamer roots, but when I think of ice spiders, I think of 1) giant spiders made of ice, 2) giant spiders that shoot ice instead of webbing, or 3) a synchronized ice-skating team made of spiders.  Ice Spiders contains none of these.

No, Ice Spiders is exactly what it says on the tin: spiders that happen to be in an icy climate, a ski lodge, to be precise. This is like calling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws</a>&nbsp;""Wet Shark"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator/dp/B003L16FAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator</a>&nbsp;""Swampy Alien."" The title's technically accurate, but it seems a bit lazy. And that pretty much sums up Ice Spiders.

Once it became clear that there are no actual spiders made of ice, shoot ice from their rear ends, or are otherwise ice-like, then one can only turn to the ski lodge itself.  I'm a simple man with simple tastes.  If giant monsters are going to terrorize people at a ski resort, I expect the following set pieces, in no particular order: a fight on a ski lift, a guy snowboarding away from a pursuing spider, and an avalanche.  Ice Spiders delivers on two of the three.

What Ice Spiders does not deliver is a coherent plot, good acting, or realistic spiders. Realistic, of course, being a figurative term since the spiders are dog-sized, survive in the frigid temperatures, and seem hell-bent on eating people. The CGI is almost uniformly bad. Vanessa A. Williams - not THAT Vanessa Williams, the other one -- is unbelievable as Dr. April Summers, but Patrick Muldoon as Dan ""Dash"" Dashiell is worse.  Muldoon is Keanu Reeves-lite: He talks like a Valley guy and mumbles his way through his lines.  There's a hilarious bit where Ice Spiders attempts to justify its genetically engineered monsters by having Dash verbally attack every silly plot point.

Dash: ""You created these spiders as bio-weapons...dude!""

April: ""No, we were harvesting their silk to make body armor and save lives!""

Dash: ""You grew them large so you could use them as bio-weapons...dude!""

April: ""No, we grew them so we could harvest lots of silk!""

You get the idea.  Ice Spiders seems awfully insecure for a movie that's embracing its B-movie monster tropes.

The spiders themselves are adorable. All six of them are each of a different type, brightly colored, and make cute little squealing sounds as they die. And just in case you're wondering, because I know you are, Ice Spiders employs MonsterCam (tm) but only for two of its eyes because showing what victims look like through eight eyes would be...well that would just be ridiculous.",1281398400,,2724,5.329439252336448

2918280,2,B000UAFDQ6,"""Ice Spiders"" is about giant government-spawned spiders versus the most annoying ski team in history. Essentially there's an evil government program to genetically engineer giant spiders for military purposes. You see, the government got a prehistoric arachnid from Afghanistan and spliced it with modern spiders to obtain their silk, which is bulletproof.

Vanessa Williams is Dr. April Sommers, a big-league expert on arachnid genetics, and is ignorant of the sinister overtones of the work at the lab. The male protagonist is Patrick Muldoon as Dan ""Dash"" Dashiell, a formerly great skier and now a has-been teaching a bunch of sniveling, elitist high school age skiers in preparation for the Olympics.

To say that Williams can't pull off the role of a brilliant scientist is a huge understatement, but she and Muldoon are actually the most likeable cast members. I was so ready for the spiders to eat all the teenagers, that every minute they were onscreen and uneaten was more and more agonizing (and made even more so by extremely ""cool"" dialogue like ""that was some nice carvin' by you, man"", and frequent use of words like ""gnarly"").

The box art is not representative of the film. The box shows gigantic spiders the size of an airplane hangar, but in the film the spiders are about the size of a golden retriever. The spiders are very poorly executed CGI and are about as realistic and scary of a science fiction creature as ""Alf"". The writing and acting are very amateurish, and the film is full of ridiculous situations that take away from the film. My favorite scene involves a school bus full of teenagers: it's completely ludicrous, yet entertaining. (The same theme was done much more skillfully with angry ravens in ""Kaw"".) Sadly some of the teens do survive the arachnid holocaust: hopefully, though, they will never be in another film.

I gave the film two stars, which is generous, because in spite of the cast, the film was sometimes quite entertaining, although in a way I suspect that the producers didn't intend.

The recycled plot is that scientists have been studying spider silk (stronger than steel and flexible) and, for some reason, one scientist genetically engineered the spiders, which grew larger and larger and then escaped.

8212597,1,B000UAFDQ6,"This is another one of those truly abysmal and why did it get made monster movies. This one involves spiders genetically mutated for research and military purposes that decide to have their human caretakers for snack and then decide the folk at a nearby ski lodge would make great desserts. The acting is bad and really overblown (though the owner of the ski lodge is actually intelligent and pretty likeable) and more the most part the characters are so annoying or leave so little impression that you just don't care about them. And the movie really makes no attempt to explain just how spiders are able to handle moving through snow and dealing with cold. There's more than a few plot holes bigger than the spiders in this one and there's no attempt to even make a token attempt to explain them. Those of you who've seen the much better 'Spiders' (about a spider on a space station that crashes back on earth), the ski instructor in this movie is the hero in 'Spiders'. If you've nothing better to do  this one might be some way to waste an hour but overall, not worth watching.",1492214400,,1081,4.543589743589743

8212599,5,B000UAFDQ6,"What are the odds that a ski resort and a top SECRET lab would share the same snowy peak?  AND!  Even though there are clearly people in the area, two hunters are on the same mountain hunting big game when they fall prey to GIANT spiders.  AND!  At the same time a bus full of snotty-teen-skiers show up bemoaning the fact that they cant get any cell phone reception on this mountain...........cue a cocooned hunter on the same mountain trying to answer his ringing cell phone.  Of course theres a conspiracy and secrecy and a shady lab guy who purposely messed with the DNA of spiders for his own nefarious purpose.  His clueless colleague swears they were just trying to collect webs to use for the betterment of mankind!  Naturally, theses GIANT spiders are smarter than everyone else and quickly escaped to eat everything they can get their legs on.  Its up to Dash (Patrick Muldoon) the almost Olympic skier to save everyone..............who hasn't already been eaten.

I found this movie funny.  Im not certain it was meant to be a comedy.  But I like movies about anything gigantic and on the rampage.  Plus, the spiders were pretty colors, like Easter eggs.",1476316800,4,1165,4.712871287128713
