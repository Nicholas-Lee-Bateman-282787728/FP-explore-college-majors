5277553,3,B0099115UU,Watchable but unremarkable legal thriller.  Matters aren't helped that Dean Martin is woefully miscast as a crusading liberal lawyer.  Dino seems bored and would rather be ogling the Golddiggers or schmoozing with Foster Brooks.  Not a bad film but not worth the price of purchase.  Wait for it for free on Xfinity On Demand or Netflix.,1360713600,3,336,4.946428571428571
5277554,5,B0099115UU,I enjoyed it very much as I enjoy to see Dean Martin as an actor and singer. One of the few actors I enjoy watching.,1356134400,,116,3.68
5277555,5,B0099115UU,Have been seeking this film on DVD to complete a DVD library of Dean Martin's films.  Quality is better than expected.,1356134400,2,118,4.619047619047619
5277556,2,B0099115UU,"One inquires about a Dean Martin movie called ""Mr. Ricco"" and three items show up. ""Mr. Ricco"" (maybe PG). ""Something Big"" (another Dean Martin film maybe PG also.

And thirdly ""Housewives Gone Bad"", a X movie about white housewives who long for black genetalia to enter their deprived lives. With an explicit film cover picture prominently displayed featuring three women displaying places to insert that longed for black genetalia.

The point here is not to criticize X stuff. Has it's place. Not here.

Get if off the Mr. Ricco search scope.

5277557,4,B0099115UU,"I have been wanting to see this movie for many years and it finally came out. It was worth wait. Dean Martin's last leading role is a fine-though dated-movie. Dean plays a lawyer who get a case thrown out on a technicality. Creating a lot of hard feelings with the police. Soon after, the freed man goes on a killing spree. Killing two cops-however he is seen at each shooting, leaving Ricco to wonder who is really behind these killings. The movie shows it's age, but it's only a movie and fans of Dean Martin will be very pleased with the rare serious Dean Martin movie. I also had to admit I was surprised at the ending, it makes sense but I did not see it coming. A final note, it's neat to see all the ""regular"" cars in the movie, Firebirds,Cameros,Mustangs,Cougars, Chargers, all just the cars of the day. Now consided classics.",1349568000,18,834,4.457516339869281

5277584,5,B0099115UU,"There was a glimpse of sadness and regret in Dean Martin's performance that I found very compelling in Mr. Ricco. This film has been given a bad rap by some Amazon reviewers and I just found Dean's acting to be very real and honest. I only wish that he and Jerry Lewis along with Frank Sinatra would have made that Peter Bodanovich gangster, hustler comedy back in 1976. It almost happened. It would've been great and different for Martin & Lewis as actors. It would have been wonderful. So sad and to bad it never happened but almost did.",1435190400,,539,4.454545454545454

5277590,1,B0099115UU,"I love Dean Martin, but this movie was terrible. I would rather watch his variety shows or Christmas special. Story is stupid and acting is bad",1388707200,,143,4.538461538461538
5277591,5,B0099115UU,Have always wanted a copy of this movie as I thought it a very good performance from Dean. Very Happy with this purchase.,1383091200,,121,4.304347826086956
5277592,2,B0099115UU,"Dean Martin's final starring vehicle was this OK crime drama that plays like a TV Movie of the Week. ""Mr. Ricco"" (1975) features Dino in a change-of-pace role as a San Francisco defense attorney. Competently made with a good supporting cast, but few surprises. Martin certainly made worse in his long career.",1379721600,2,308,4.9423076923076925

8537722,5,B0099115UU,"I'm a big ""Dino"" fan, so I was not disappointed. He made better films but if your a fan of Deans you ought to watch this one, if for no other reason,you can tell fellow Martinites you did see it",1499731200,,194,3.875

8537724,4,B0099115UU,"A film of its time but none the less entertaining, takes you back to those days.
 Well acted by all the cast. Dean Martin remains his calm self, manages to convince the viewer of his role. A versatile entertainer.",1489968000,,213,4.461538461538462
8537725,4,B0099115UU,"Dean Martin's last film as a leading man. This film is a time capsule of the San Francisco Bay area during the early 1970's.. A tightly wound suspense film with an excellent performance by Mr. Martin. Martin plays tough, experienced attorney Joe Ricco who spends his days defending people against the police machine. After he successfully defends a murder suspect against tampered evidence, someone suddenly starts taking shots at him....

It's a good solid movie reminding us why we loved Dino. He's always the right guy at the right time.",1480032000,,540,5.0
8537726,2,B0099115UU,"This one's for Dean Martin fans only. The quality is pretty low, and the movie has the look of a made-for-TV production. The plot is totally ridiculous. Made in the early 1970's, it was obviously trying to capitalize on the emerging ""Blaxplotation"" trend, with bad guy, white racist cops and thugs doing all the criminal work. Dino is rather miscast as a crusading attorney who gets a guilty man off, and runs afoul of the resentful cops. it stretches credulity that his best friend, played by Eugene Roche (probably best remembered for his dishwasher soap commercials), is a high ranking police detective. . Thalamus Rasulala  and Philip Thomas (later of Miami Vice) play a black radicals, and gorgeous Denise Nicholas (Room 222) provides some ""eye-candy"" scenes. Dino has a knock-down, drag-out fight with Rasulala that isn't half bad, by professional wrestling standards,that is. Martin was a professional boxer before he entered show business, but he'd obviously lost his moves. Dino was at the end of the resurgence of his career when he made this one, and sort of sleepwalks through the role. He just looks plain tired. The ending is so far fetched and ridiculous that it borders on being a parody. It's too bad this marked the final leading movie role for Dino, because it was not a good way to go out. None of the Rat Pack really did well in their later choices of movie roles, and Martin's best role was playing himself on his variety show. This one is for hard core Dean Martin fans only.",1473292800,,1498,4.7615384615384615
8537727,2,B0099115UU,"This film was the last nail in the coffin of Deans movie career. Man, even he doesn't seem to be into it. Lousy story not even as good as a 1970s tv cop movie!",1458086400,,159,3.7058823529411766

8537729,4,B0099115UU,"Not a great film, but it was a typical 70s crime drama  movie. If you're a Dean Martin fan it's worth watching because Dean looks great in this flick and it seems like he' s playing himself more than he's playing the character Joe Ricco, and because of that, I found some of the scenes pretty amusing.",1443571200,,301,4.280701754385965
