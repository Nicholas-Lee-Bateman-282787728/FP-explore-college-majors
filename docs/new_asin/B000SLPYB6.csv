8205791,5,B000SLPYB6,"This is the best NOVA ever produced.  The story itself is great, but on top of that, the NOVA directors tell the story with great suspense.  They also found great music that captures the majesty of the quest.  Then there's the fact that amazing things were discovered.  It happened between 2002 and 2012, yet most people don't know about it.

I don't know why this NOVA is so hard to find.  It should be on NETFLIX and PBS.org.",1431302400,,427,4.410256410256411
8205792,5,B000SLPYB6,"I really love this one. ""Saturn's Titan"" is another one of those great NOVA productions filled with information and understanding about a specific topic - the whole Cassini Mission. I don't usually like a lot of music, but this music in particular is just beautiful against all that ton of information - the details of the mission, orbital flight plan through the solar system, the scientists and engineers - it goes on and on and on - it's a complete documentary. When you have a documentary that's visually beautiful and is filled with detailed information and explanation, you can't ask for more.  This one is hard to beat.",1297728000,,626,4.796296296296297
8205793,4,B000SLPYB6,"This video was fascinating as it takes the viewer from the beginning to the end of the Cassini voyage from earth to Saturn and then to Titan, one of Saturn's moons.  It discusses in detail what the scientists were trying to accomplish and gives us insight into Saturn's rings as well as what the surface of Titan is like in comparison to the earth.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone, young or old, who is interested in any of the planets.

I also happened to notice near the end, although this was not credited, John Williams' music from Raiders of the Lost Ark -- The Map Room sequence.  The music was actually quite appropriate here -- mysterious.  I would have liked to have heard some excerpts of Gustav Holst's ""Saturn"" from The Planets during this video, but was a little disappointed that I did not.  Holst's music is eerie and would have made good background music, as this video is all about Saturn.",1297296000,,921,4.551515151515152
