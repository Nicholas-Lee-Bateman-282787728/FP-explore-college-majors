7902803,5,B000003KAK,"When Voyager first started I thought of two things for the Delta Quadrant; The Borg, and the stranded Ferangi.  For those of you who don't know, the Ferangi of this episode of Voyager became stuck in the Delta Quadrant in an episode of The Next Generation.
I assumed Voyager would forget about these Ferangi and move on to the Borg, but its good they paid homage to Star Trek history.  Though the episode itself isn't Voyager's best (see Caretaker, Scorpion, Think Tank, Year of Hell, and Equinox), I find it thrilling that the Voyager writers took the time to remember what was such a trivial episode of TNG, involving the Federation and others (including the Ferangi) bargaining for the rights of what they thought was a stable wormhole.",1057968000,,739,4.765625
7902804,2,B000003KAK,"Well, if you just LOVE the Ferengi, I'd say jump right on this episode of Voyager. But I certainly wouldn't call it among the best Ferengi episodes in Trek (those reside in the Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine series), nor would I call it a particularly strong Voyager outing.
In this episode, the crew of Voyager comes across a couple of Ferengi who have been in the Delta Quadrant for some time, scamming an entire civilization by posing as gods.  As in all Ferengi episodes, there are some humorous moments...but I honestly feel that at times, the episode drags.  The ending was pretty good, but that does not make up for the silliness during the mid-section of the script.
If you want Ferengi, go check out one of several DS9 episodes.  If you want outstanding Star Trek Voyager, look to one of the other episodes.",1008115200,3,813,4.586206896551724
