2501495,4,B000E6JH36,"ok for the price this set is good,but if you own many of these 50 movie packs check out what's on them because a lot of these are on oyer sets. if you don't own one then get this one i think you'll like it.",1148083200,2,206,3.6
8106684,4,B000E6JH36,good bargain.,1500508800,,13,6.0
8106685,5,B000E6JH36,I received the set in the mail today. I paid 5.74. I have only watched two films on it so far and both are great. The first film alone was the equivalent of the price. The two I watched are Beast of Yucca Flats and Swamp Women. Both movies are four out of 5 star material. Coleman Francis's narration in Yucca is wonderful. If you prefer picture quality to be above decent then you should know some pixels are present. This is cheaply made but worthwhile. Collection.,1494374400,,467,4.379310344827586
8106686,3,B000E6JH36,"Terrible quality. But that being said, I only paid 49 cents for a used copy. Well worth it even with shipping. They're very old movies, not remastered in any way, although I was expecting the sound quality to be worse than it was for a lot of the titles. What irks me the most is on disc 5, side A, the movie ""Dracula and His Vampire Brides"" isn't that movie at all. Instead it's ""Satanic Rites of Dracula"" (which can be found on disc 1, side B of this set) with a cheap looking homemade title card inserted in the film by someone trying to pass it off as the correct movie. It's slightly better quality than the one on disc 1, though, but still the same movie.  Again, I didn't expect much for 49 cents. Case had some slight damage, which was noted by the seller. I'm giving it three stars because even with all of its flaws, it was a heck of a deal for me.",1445472000,,858,4.107142857142857
8106687,5,B000E6JH36,If you enjoy B horror flicks from days gone by you will like this disk set. We loaned this out to a family member and they enjoyed it so much we had to get another one.,1420588800,,168,3.6944444444444446
8106688,4,B000E6JH36,"50 Horror Classics have been compiled in many different releases with different titles on each. This release is the version that was on a TV ad in the early 2000's with a number to call to order it. It is the best version of any of the compilation releases, but probably 20 out of the 50 films on here are not that good. Highlights include: Night of the Living Dead, Satanic Rites of Dracula, Nosferatu, Eaten Alive (watch out as the ending has been omitted), The Brain That Wouldn't Die,  House on Haunted Hill, Dimentia 13 (by Francis Ford Coppola), The Devil's Hand, Carnival of Souls, I Bury the Living, White Zombie, Maniac (1933), Count Dracula and his Vampire Brides (the best of the Christopher Lee Dracula films) and Last Man On Earth. This set is worth buying for these films at least. The DVD transfer is great on some films and terribly pixilated on other films. Not the best quality, but worth it for the films I mentioned!",1356048000,2,936,4.538461538461538
8106689,3,B000E6JH36,"Okay, I took a chance on this set, used, I mean, I paid like $3.50 and another $3 shipped, so I didn't spend alot.  I knew beforehand that having fifty movies compressed about five movies per side is over compression, BUT what I found out on the content, is that for instance, this set had ""The Severed Arm"" complete, not missing the last fifteen minutes of the movie like in a Mill Creek set of nightmare worlds, where I had asked the nice folks at mill creek to send me a replacement for that and two other scratched discs and they sent those freely immediately, they are a wonderful company and I have alot of their stuff(and compared to the transfers on this set, mill creek stuff would seem like premium stuff, ha), but the replacement movie didn't have the ending either, this set does, I always wondered what happened when the last man alive went to the mountains with the daughter of the guy who lost his arm, and no, I won't give a spoiler, you would be very surprised, I am very delighted I purchased this set, might have been worth it if I paid the full ten dollars new.  Also, I noticed that the movies are not disc copy protected, its rather obvious.
I also noticed these movies refused to play on my computer dvd player, but would my old sylvania regular dvd nicely, and of course my blue ray player, still with alot of pixelization.  For the cost of these, there are a few titles one can get a ""taste of"", and if so desired they can get better copies, and there were some I never seen nor heard of, a big plus, not to mention the ending to severed arm I was finally able to see, I mean, I was thinking the ending was lost everywhere or something otherwise mill creek sets would have had it, I was wrong.
I've seen this set other places new/used like Wal-mart website and ebay, and a 100 movie set obviously put out by the same company here.
ONE THING I did just notice, I played ""Nosferatu"", the silent movie from 1922, and it is in pretty much good watchable condition, I need to watch it all the way through, but its in comparable condition to my mill creek set copy of their horror classics(a set I highly recommend).
Another thing I did notice, that I played some of these movies on my cheap magnavox vcr/dvd player through my old ten year old philips 28"" tube t.v., and that with the image shrunk to about what they call ""1/2"" standard with a viewable area of 19""(in order that the t.v. does not crop the whole image), that these movies and their pixelations/texture changes are not very to not noticeable at all, its like watching my high quality movies then on my high def, its cause the higher def tv you have and larger the screen, the more pixelation affects viewing quality, its like when you zoom in a poor digital picture you have and you keep zooming in till you really can't make out things real well.  Of course, using the full screen on that t.v. was okay for viewing some of the poorest transfers as well.  This is because old t.v.s are 480P resolution, and they are just not going to be able to keep showing perfect little pixelations like a high def, but will just show lower resolution.  Ah sure, lower resolution is what the problem is with alot of these compressed movies, and the lower resolution t.v. or image(if possible with many high def tv's) is what you need to become more comfortable viewing some of these movies.  Low light in the movies is where low resolution gets ya with bad image.
So there you have it, the tricks of el cheapo movies, and what to do or what I've found out.  I say if you can get this set for around ten dollars, definitely less, there is alot to see if you just want to see for yourself, I mean, there are better sets out there, but they aren't always on sale, well....actually they seem to be, like I said, it seems you can get the Horror Classics by mill creek from so many places at the usual supposed sale price of $12.49, its just a matter of getting on the wal mart or ebay site if you can't get it right here which would be doubtful.  Ah, but you likely won't be able to get a full version of ""The Severed Arm"" like on this set, that is for sure, or some of the other minor titles.",1287014400,2,4158,4.300127713920817
8106690,3,B000E6JH36,I received my product in a timely manner and they were in very good condition and the price was just right.,1240185600,,107,4.142857142857143
8106691,1,B000E6JH36,"Like all of the above comments, the biggest drawback to any of these is the awful, awful, recording quality. Who cares what the cost per movie is? I guess people who like ""deals"" like this buy $1000 cars that barely run, leak oil, smoke, overheat etc. but its ok because they got a ""deal"". Pass on garbage like this!!!",1223942400,7,318,4.406779661016949
8106692,1,B000E6JH36,"Has a few OK horror flicks but it's mostly cheesy ""B-rated"" (or lower) horror movies of years past. Quality-wise, the transfer from film to DVD is terrible!",1199750400,6,156,4.814814814814815
8106693,1,B000E6JH36,"The recording quality on these movies is absolutely terrible, much worse than VHS.  Very fuzzy with what I would call ""digital pixels"" at times. Aside from the poor recording quality, I discovered after sitting through nearly an hour and a half of one of the movies that the ending had been omitted! I have almost made it through the first disc. What a disappointment this set has been.",1173312000,21,386,4.676470588235294
