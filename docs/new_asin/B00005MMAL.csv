1627975,4,B00005MMAL,"if you love irvine welsh, this is a MUST!!  trainspotting left a <few> details out to be desired, but the acid house follows every element of the short stories.  the scottish accent gets a bit thick at times, but you get use to it eventually.  definately a great experience for those of us who love to get lost in irvine's realistically twisted worlds.",994204800,4,352,4.555555555555555
1627976,4,B00005MMAL,"The Acid House is an exciting trilogy of stories that involve God, a possessed baby, and some disturbing sexual material.  The movie is a trip into the exotic and unexplainable.  Irvine Welsh wrote the screenplay, that he adapted from his book, and he did an excellent job.  Most people know him as the writer of Trainspotting.  If you like Trainspotting, then The Acid House should be right up your alley.  With twisted humor, intriguing characters, and twisted plot lines, The Acid House delivers a good time for the whole dysfunctional family.",992649600,2,546,4.956043956043956
1627977,4,B00005MMAL,"A collection of three films strung together with wildly different results.

The first film (The Granton Star Cause 8/10) is a pleasant surprise and high comedy. It is a take on Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis mixed with God, elderly S and M, and a football team. Outrageous and funny it is great black comedy involving a bloke named Boab who is having a very bad day indeed. And as God lovingly points out it is his own lazy incompetence that is basically responsible for his troubles.

The second film (The Soft Touch 10/10) is a top-notch drama that, for me at least, hit close to home. Kevin McKidd portrays a get along cuckolded husband with perfection while Gary McCormick, as Larry is stunning as the upstairs neighbor. American audiences are not used to seeing their protagonists pushed this far without pushing back but to this ear it rang realistic and very sadly true. The third film

(The Acid House 2/10) is a very overlong train wreck that may have worked on paper but fails miserably in film. It includes such Trainspotting regulars as that horrible mechanical baby (Like a demented Chucky) and brainless Coco who amuses for about five minutes before becoming tiresome. Add horrendous dialog, endless poop jokes and an acid trip left over from a Peter Fonda film and you have one great mess. As a five-minute bit it could have worked but time seems to stand still while it drags its bloated carcass on the screen.

God (who appears in all 3 segments wonderfully played by Maurice Roeves) may seem vengeful in the first film and carelessly sadistic in the second, but this viewer was praying to him during the third segment to make the pain go away.",1169251200,4,1658,4.706896551724138
1627978,3,B00005MMAL,"I heard about this movie a few years ago from a friend.  What mainly interested me was that it was based on a novel by Irvine Welsh who also wrote Trainspotting.  I loved the movie Trainspotting and so i decided to watch this, hoping it would be similar.  It's really not.  The film has its moments, but the camera work and the editing make parts of it very choppy.  The story is not one story, but three and there is only a loose connection between them.  It doesn't have near the drug content (or the drug related humor) that Trainspotting did.  If you're a fan of Welsh's books then this may be worth watching, but if you're looking for another humorous take on drug addiction in Scotland, this is not Trainspotting 2.",1126137600,2,721,4.416666666666667
1627979,1,B00005MMAL,"This film was a very bizarre characterization of the Irvine Welsh collection of stories of the same name. While Trainspotting was a spot-on adaptation of a similar kind of book (random stories and characters) and excellent on-screen, The Acid House is better left for the printed page, although the unusual Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting's unforgettable ""Spud"") is a stand-out here.",1111536000,5,379,5.440677966101695
1627980,2,B00005MMAL,"Well, It just so happened that i only ""stumbled"" upon this film.

It was on Foxtel recently and i flicked over, and it was already about halfway thru, but once i watched only even a minute of it, i could not bring myself to turn it off or change channels.

I have seen Trainspotting and that is not really my kind of film, and this film certainly isn't my kind either, but I can appreciate other people would like it.

I am quite converservative but like to think I have an open mind about most things, but maybe I don't.  One of the lines in this film (only being able to realise what it was saying, due to the subtitles) that i found absolutely appalling was ""lick ya mother's pi** flaps, ya c**t"".  I just couldn't not believe it.  I was in shock and disbelief.

This film, as did Trainspotting, certainly showed me how some people in the world really live, and their unfortunate circumstances, and as much as I disliked it, i could not seem to look away or change channels.  It saddens me to think that there are really situations like that and people living in an everyday hell.  Makes me realise how lucky I am.",1101686400,2,1117,4.331730769230769
1627981,3,B00005MMAL,"As I review more and more films they are slowly becoming more and more difficult to review.  Why?  There are just some films out there that are this solid mix of great and average that it is difficult to give a definitive answer.  Did I like it or didn't I?  The lines are getting more and more fuzzy as the films continue to pour on.  The only ones that I do not have trouble with are the uncreative lacklusters that Hollywood is notorious for releasing.  Thankfully, that is not the case with The Acid House.  Considered by some to be Trainspotting 2, I think that in actuality it is below Trainspotting.  While Trainspotting had a definite plot and characters, this one is simply random stories that have come together in the end.  There is no doubt in my mind that Irvine Welch's stories are superb.  The styles in which these are portrayed and carried out are very imaginative and realistic (in a surreal sort of way) which really kept my attention.  What they do lack is structure.  That is why I have added this collection of stories to my list of books that I would like to own, but not the film.  I cannot read the other stories that Irvine Welch has imagined for his home country, sadly, I am not interested in seeing anymore short stories theatrically released.

Don't get me wrong.  This was my type of film.  It was graphic, yet poignant, subtle yet powerful, and very brilliantly written with some interesting messages about life, it was just that I think it was too much for the director to handle.  This was director Paul McGuigan's first film, and you could tell that he was just a little rough around the edges.  He has transformed into a brilliant director since this film, but it just seems like this first film was pushed and again, rough around the edges.  For example, the child in the final story eerily resembled Chucky from the Child's Play films.  This cheap way of creating this character thoroughly distracted me from the story, but McGuigan was able to redeem himself with the final scene of this film when CoCo comes back to his body.  This was the type of ""give and take"" that you had to accept with this film.  While there were some horrible scenes, there were equally amazing scenes.  I almost felt that I was watching a rough-cut of a Guy Ritchie film.  There were just scenes that stood out that seemed like they were his classic moments.

I enjoyed the way these stories all came together.  I loved the second story the most because it was so brilliantly depressing that you just couldn't help but find a piece of you somewhere in there.  The first story was decent, but a bit too grotesque for my liking, while the third was surreally comical.  I loved the subtitles (that were random throughout my version of the film) that allowed me to fully understand what these characters were saying.  It was a good film.  Not quite the potential that Trainspotting had, but still a decent film.  I cannot wait to read the book and see what I missed from watching this first.

Overall, fun to watch the first time, but a continuous viewing will not be necessary.

1627982,5,B00005MMAL,"This movie is excellent.  I suggest you read the book before you see the movie though, otherwise you'll really not know what the hell is going on because its very difficult to understand what thoes goddamn people are trying to say even though it has subtitles.  This movie take three main stories from the book and recreates them into live action, following strictly to the written material.  It was cool to see the movie after reading the book because it gave me a new view on how to picture everything in my mind, from the way the cities looked, the way that the characters looked and so on.  This movie was dead on.  Everything that I imagined while reading the book is what I saw on the screen when i saw the movie. Irvine Welsh has done it again.  He is a literary god!",1022112000,8,774,4.340277777777778
1627983,4,B00005MMAL,"""the acid house"", reunites 3 different stories written by irvine welsh...(writter of ""trainspotting"" , and co-writter of ""dockers"")...about misfortune,football,drugs,god,neighbors and of course,coco!
these hilarious shorts are really bizzare!...the title says it all! it's very ""acid"".
the first segment of the film is called ""the granton star cause""...in this introduction, boab (stephen Mccole) an apparently mediocre football player is being rejected from his team, his fiance,his parents and to top it all,beaten by a bunch of cops and punished by GOD!(maurice roeves)...after a long arguement with boab.,god finaly decides to transform him into an insect.(what happens next is just too long to explain)
the second part of the film is entitled "" a soft touch"",it's the most depressive and detestable moment of ""the acid house""..johnny,(kevin mckidd) is married to catriona (michelle gomez),a self-destructive,dumb wife who sleeps with her neighbor,prostitutes herself and eventualy gets pregnant..the neighbor,larry(gary mccormack) uses johnny's electricity,he comes and goes in johnny's flat,sleeps with his wife..etc..the ending of this short film is very annoying!...but the acting in this segment is simply magnificent, and frightfully realistic!
...
the final, and 3rd part of the acid house...called ""the acid house"", and is without a doubt the best short of this trilogy. it's about coco (ewen bremner),who is struck by lightning and suddenly swaps his mind (or soul) into a newborn baby...the reslut is simply hysterical!...
the direction: the acid house was paul mcguigan's first film . after that,followed the exellent ""gangster number one"" and recently, ""morality play""...his style is very recognizable!,and works even better in ""gangster number one"",(it's a more mature work IMHO)...the same goes for andrew hulmer (his editor),who also worked on G.number1 and Morality play. his style goes pretty wild on the final segment of the film!
the acting and cast:
the best thing about the ""acid house"" is it's cast of incredible actors...from michelle gomez (who also played in michel blanc's ""the escort"" starring daniel auteuil & who  also was in the ""stage version"" of trainspotting), to kevin mckidd (also known for his part in trainspotting as ""tommy"", topsy-turvy, small faces) , there's also maurice roeves (beautiful creatures ,  last of the mohicans) , stephen mccole (orphans , band of brothers , my name is joe), garry sweeney (small faces) , gary mccormack (gangster n. 1 , gangs of new york) and ewen bremner or ""spud"" (trainspotting , naked , julien the donkey boy , snatch , black hawk down, morality play )
the music...if you don't own it already, make sure to buy the soundtrack of this film ,it features great groups such as ""primal scream"" , ""oasis"" , ""chemical brothers"" , ""texas"" , ""the pastels"", ""beth orton"" , ""arab strap""..etc......etc..
the acid house is not as good as ""trainspotting"" but it's worth checking!. (try fo find the dvd version of the film if possible, it contains interesting stuff such as irvine wlesh's commentary and interview,theatrical trailer,and of course a glossary (you'll need it!,some words have different and several meanings..)",1006992000,10,3189,5.466531440162272
1627984,4,B00005MMAL,"Well, ladies and gents. If you are a fan of Scottish cinema or Irvine Welsh or just strange indie flicks you should take a flight on the Acid House airlines. 3 sorted stories to make your skin crawl. The Acid House delivers yet another one of Welsh's great books. Nice, romatic, sweet people should stay away from this flick. But anyone who likes their movies full flavored should stop and pick up this masterpiece. If you are a fan of Welsh than the accents and slang should be no problem but for anyone else it will take some getting used to. This covers lots of cool things that people were afraid to put in Trainspotting. Thank Zeitgeist filmsfor delivering a fantastic new movie for a real collectors collection.

1627986,4,B00005MMAL,"The film expressed this atrocious resonance through-out the film. From the first story through the thrid one. It certainly showed lunacy with acid trips and switching of bodies and mind. Some satiric behaviors were inflicted upon two characters. One had a really awful day then meets a man that changed his life entirely. Then another, that was just fed up with his life and significant other's actions. I've yet to read the book but I think it's still too early to judge which is better. I'm guessing the book.",995500800,2,511,4.752808988764045

7946042,5,B00005MMAL,"I VERY MUCH enjoyed this, yes, was blown away by the orginality and vision of the filmmakers. You do not need to read the book before seeing this movie (I have never read the book). If you like psychedelic exploration, originality, twists and turns, well executed weirdness, and an existential viewing experience, watch this movie!

I would like to quote reviewer pappymccree, who accurately defined ""Acid House"" as ""an underrated work of madness""!!

By the way, this is an excellent movie to watch while ""altered""... But, just as that state is not for everyone, this movie is not for everybody. It's a classic example of ""love it or hate it"". To each his own!",1304985600,,660,4.780701754385965
