Overall a pretty entertaining set. This is more of a feel good dvd or a party dvd. Beer bashes, Rock promos, Spin-a-roonis, Stunners, feel-good matches, and hilarious promos. There's no commentary for any of the matches. The run-time is about 6 and 1/2 hours long. Segments run anywhere from 4 minutes to 45 minutes!

Quick thing to mention is that this is TV-14, there's a lot of foul language (mostly because of the marathon of Austin Beer Bashes and Rock Promos). Some of the segments do run a little long and a couple really drag. But overall this is a great set to watch of exclusive content and never-before-seen matches. If you're ever having a WWE-themed party this would be a great video to have playing during the party!",1398211200,4,3575,4.302395209580839

Overall: This DVD is jam-packed with dozens of Raw moments to happen over the years. We think the cameras stop rolling when the credits flash across our tv screens every Monday night at 11:05 but that's not to be. They kept rolling and for the first time ever are being delivered on a 3 disc set with over 30 of the most hilarious and unforgettable moments to take place after Raw went off the air. The Big Red People's Elbow, and Under-Take-A-Rooni are moments alone for anyone to buy this DVD set. Hopefully they make a volume 2 or a Smackdown Edition down the line",1395273600,4,3210,4.523893805309735

Thanks to [...] for the list

Overall, this is stuff filmed after the Raw show to send the crowd home happy. It seems it's mostly Stone Cold stuff but still looks interesting.",1394150400,16,2818,4.544715447154472

6202031,5,B00HRYH6DG,thank you so much for my order,1418688000,,30,3.4285714285714284
6202032,4,B00HRYH6DG,"I don't think the ""best of"" title is fitting for a collection like this simply Raw: After the Show would have fit better. I enjoyed it it was cool to see and being apart of some after Raw moments personally I know how cool and fun those moments are",1418083200,,248,4.081632653061225
6202033,5,B00HRYH6DG,It's a great DVD. You really get to know the superstars out of character. They have a lot of fun after the show is over and they enjoy sending the fans home happy. It's worth the purchase.,1414368000,,188,4.108108108108108

6202036,5,B00HRYH6DG,Lots of fun re-living the Attitude Era after the main show went off the air.  Good work WWE!,1409270400,,92,4.111111111111111
6202037,4,B00HRYH6DG,Very unique look at what goes on after the show is off TV.  A must see.,1407801600,,71,3.4375
6202038,3,B00HRYH6DG,"It's an okay DVD set. It isn't all ""never before seen"" though and WWE should really should've clarified this beforehand. Both of the Stone Cold Steve Austin segments can be seen on his ""Stone Cold Truth"" DVD, which was released in 2004.

Some of the material on this set is absolutely hilarious but really, the third disc was unnecessary. For me, anyway. I can watch a match without commentary if there are one of two things. 1.) It's pure wrestling or 2.) If I'm watching it live in the arena. These matches should've been saved in the memories of those who were there that night and the third disc should have been a continuation of the first and second discs, which were rather entertaining at points.

It would've also helped if the wrestlers who were involved in these moments actually did a shoot and explained it a bit but it was okay with Renee Young guiding us through each scene.

Overall, it's not a set I'd recommend spending money on because most of these moments are what I'd call ""YouTube moments"" and will never be watched again. And speaking of YouTube, I'm sure these scenes will be uploaded soon so kids, if you're reading, beg your parents for another DVD for Christmas and watch these moments when they arrive on the YouTube scene.

My favorites:

1.) Under-Take-A-Rooni? (on Disc One)
2.) Stone Cold's Music City (on Disc one)
3.) Stone Cold Steve Austin Salutes Cameraman (on Disc Two)",1406419200,,1408,4.661290322580645
6202039,4,B00HRYH6DG,"GOOD DVD SET, GETS ALITTLE BORING AS TIME GOES ON, DUE TO THE FACT THERE IS NO COMMENTARY OR MUSIC. ONCE THE MAIN SHOW IS DONE, THIS IS JUST COMMENTS AND ANTICS FROM THE WRESTLERS ITSELF....",1405987200,,190,4.305555555555555
6202040,4,B00HRYH6DG,It was a pretty good DVD if you ever wondered about what happens after the show goes off the air,1405382400,,96,3.85
6202041,1,B00HRYH6DG,Pretty boring stuff!  Segments drag on way to long.  Don't waste your money.  Better of buying A DVD with actual matches.,1403481600,,121,4.666666666666667
6202042,3,B00HRYH6DG,"this was a gift for a friend and he said it was a good watch but it was a lot of wrestlers walking to the ring and standing there while stone cold or ric flair give a speech, he said it got very repetitive after a while, it's best watched in small doses.",1402876800,2,254,3.811320754716981
6202043,4,B00HRYH6DG,Many never-before seen clips.  There was really too much of the McMahon family.  We know they own the business but they aren't the business and there are many deserving superstars who never made it to the DVD to make room for the McMahon family.,1402272000,,245,4.545454545454546
6202044,5,B00HRYH6DG,"Love it when business of Pro Wrestling give the fans what they want & go above and beyond. That is what this DVD is choc full of. The (for lack of a better term) after party. When it's all a shoot & the wrestlers cold kinda break character to make jokes, be real with the crowd & sometimes guzzle some Steveweisers!
Plus I just heard on Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast today that he & Vince got fined ($25,000 the first time) by the arenas a time or two because of the shenanigans keeping arena staff over an hour or so past contract agreements.
So the WWE sometimes paid extra out of pocket to please the fans with all the mischief & merriment in the almost secret shows you see on these DVDs.
Enjoy! Pop yourself a Steveweiser & laugh to what these modern day gladiators are cookin'!",1401321600,,787,4.324324324324325
6202045,5,B00HRYH6DG,"I'm so glad that the WWE had the foresight to archive everything they've ever taped because it brings us gems like this. I hope this sells well so we could get more releases like it.

I imagine their tape vault is like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.",1400544000,4,251,4.456521739130435
6202046,5,B00HRYH6DG,This is a pretty cool Dvd! You thank once Raw goes off air that is it! No way there are alot of pretty cool moments in this video! Its a must buy!!,1400112000,,147,3.625
6202047,4,B00HRYH6DG,"WWE has a catchphrase that goes ""anything can happen"" & that statement has never been more true than what happens after 11:05pm on Monday night where the show is over for the home audience but the after-party begins for the live audience as we get segments & matches that sends the crowd home happy as small amount of various moments have been released until now as you get a taste of what happens once the show is over on ""Best Of RAW: After The Show.""  This isn't a documentary with past & present superstars discussing the main issue or a match anthology but a different presentation featuring matches & moments that's just all about showing how much fun the talent have when it's just them & the live fans as Rene Young hosted this set while it should be noted that there was no commentary throughout the presentation since all of these matches & segments happened after the show.

At times you just saw things that were continuations of the angles coming off the air including Austin continuing to deliver multiple stunners on the McMahon-Helmsley regine, The Rock having a Rock Bottom marathon on Shane, Austin & The Rock's meeting before WrestleMania XIX, Eric Bischoff crashes Austin's beer bash, and The Rock & John Cena join forces together.  Some moments were just pure non-stop fun like Too Cool's dance party with the Dudleys & Chris Jericho & Big Show, The Rock-A-Rooni, Shawn Stasiak being welcomed to San Antonio by The Rock, The Rock questioning Kurt Angle, what a child at ringside said that made The Rock crack up laughing, Austin's birthday salute to a cameraman, Austin & Jericho going back & forth with the crowd playing off the ""WHAT!?!"" chants, who decided to make out with Fabulous Moolah on her 80th birthday, Hogan posing with John Cena & Batista along with a die-hard (and you'll see how I can say that) Hogan fan, DX getting a double dose of ""John Cena"", Triple H's special moment on ""Z! True Long Island Story"" with Zach Ryder, the reunion of The Rock & Steve Austin & Mick Foley, John Cena's birthday celebration, and the crowd Fandangoing after WrestleMania XVIII.  You also got some emotional moments including the roster celebrating Ric Flair's career in South Carolina along with Flair later thanking his fans of North Carolina.  One of the best parts of this is that you see the superstars outside of their normal characters & incidents that you would never see on television such as Austin telling the fans what ""the one thing I can't stand"" was, Undertaker & Rock talking about their favorite desert along with Kane giving The People's Elbow all before Triple H gave an apology to a fan that made the crowd speechless, the one man you wouldn't believe Austin actually gave a stunner to...BROTHER!, Austin & RVD & Booker T attempt to get Lilian Garcia to do a spin-a-rooni, and my favorite segment on this set where so many talents (babyfaces & heels) coming out including Vince himself to see Undertaker do a spin-a-rooni & tried to encourage him by doing their own.

The matches themselves include Shawn Michaels & Randy Orton vs. Triple H & Ric Flair that was definitely a match you wouldn't see on TV due to how Triple H stepped out of his ""Cerebral Assassin"" character by just having fun with certain fans at ringside & doing comedy spots that you saw his opponents get involved in & laugh at, John Cena vs. Edge in a street fight that went all around ringside & the stage area, Triple H vs. Randy Orton, John Cena vs. C.M. Punk in Cena's hometown of Boston that saw both men use some weapons around ringside along with Punk getting physical with a ""fan"" at ringside, and the infamous six man tag match after WrestleMania XXVIII with Randy Orton & Big Show & Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan & Kane & Cody Rhodes where the crowd made it perfectly clear who's the only person they wanted to see out of all six men.

Blu-Ray extras include Austin & Lilian riding an ATV, John Cena vs. Edge vs. Triple H in a Steel Cage Match, Sheamus in Las Vegas, The Rock giving Cody Rhodes a cajun greeting, Bret Hart Appreciation Night, and John Cena vs. Ryback in a Tables Match.  The only negative things I could say is that some of the segments get repetitive (Austin's beer bashes) & the segment with Austin & RVD & Booker T trying to get Lilian to do a spin-a-rooni in a short dress for close to 40 minutes when she made it clear she wasn't going to do it while I would have loved to see the six man Hell In A Cell that most people never knew happened.  Overall as I stated earlier, this was a different type of presentation of WWE as this was all about fun & watching this set was fun for a few laughs so I would recommend this.",1400025600,7,4653,4.536352800953516

It has some of the most hilarious footage that the WWE has never publicly produced before this release, and Stone Cold Steve Austin & The Rock are the stars of the whole set. The post-show improv sessions from the Attitude Era are mostly gems with a bit of the later stuff, while good, paling in comparison. So don't hesitate, just get it.
