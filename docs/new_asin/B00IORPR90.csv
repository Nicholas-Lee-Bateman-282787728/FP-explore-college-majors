6284461,3,B00IORPR90,"Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" movies came out almost fifteen years ago, and pretty much every high fantasy movie since then has shamelessly ripped them off. It's gotten so common that it seems almost pointless to even note it.

And that is the big pitfall of ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer,"" an RPG-style fantasy movie set in a mystical land cut off from its gods. It weakly copies a lot of stuff from ""Lord of the Rings"" -- and for some reason, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" -- but the story is actually pretty strong when it stands on its own and tries to tell its own tale, especially when the orc bandit takes center stage.

Elf bounty hunter Nemyt (Danielle Chuchran) hunts down and kills an orc bandit -- but as he dies, he transfers the mark of an evil death god onto her. Unless it's removed, it will turn her into a brainwashed zombie. Meanwhile, the cleric Keltus (Richard McWilliams) investigates followers of that same death god, on behalf of a divinely-guided prophetess whom he serves.

When he encounters Nemyt, he recognizes that she may be his best chance of hunting down the orc raiders who serve the Shadow. So he breaks her out of prison, and teams up with the ousted orc leader, Kullimon (Paul D. Hunt) to stop the god of death from coming to Earth. But Keltus' confidence may lead to his undoing, because anyone can be corrupted by the dark mark...

""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"" copies ""Lord of the Rings."" A lot. Orc prosthetics, weapon designs (is that a store-brand Hadhafang?), a vaguely Balrog-like death god, and an opening monologue that you can play Galadriel bingo with. Let's see -- ""whispers,"" ""Shadow"" ""alliance,"" ""darkness"" in a compass direction... you know, typical stuff. There's even a ""dark rider"" and a weird little creep who talks like Gollum, although these aren't supernaturally-warped creatures. They're just... weird guys.

There's also a oddly pointless scene involving carnivorous mermaids (which seems an awful lot like a certain scene from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"") trying to seduce Kullimon. It has nothing to do with anything, and is never mentioned again.

And yet... there's a certain charm to ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer."" It's made with an earnest enthusiasm and obvious care, unlike the slapdash fantasy movies you'll find on SyFy. Despite its flaws, it was clearly created with love by all the people involved.

Ironically, the movie works best when it stands on its own two feet and avoids Tolkienian material -- we have steampunk dwarves, an order of holy warriors (although they seem pretty uninspired), guardian deities and a secret cult of death. And if you can overlook all the debts to Tolkien, it's put together rather well, with a decent RPG-style storyline, some surprisingly good prosthetics and decent dialogue (Kullimon singing an orc song is hilarious). And it pulls off a pretty solid ending that makes logical sense.

Paul D. Hunt steals every single scene he's in as Kullimon, despite wearing enough prosthetics to drown in. He plays the orc bandit as smart, casual, and sometimes much more competent than his human or elven compatriots, since he isn't a loner nor is he the servant of a fickle goddess. Chuchran and McWilliams aren't quite as good, but they are decent -- he's a slightly stiff knight-errant type, while she is almost feral in her wildness.

""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"" would be a far better movie if it had dropped the crutch of ""Lord of the Rings,"" but it's a decent RPG-style fantasy movie anyway. For fantasy nerds, this is a better-than-average little indie flick.",1401494400,6,3602,4.85342019543974

6284468,4,B00IORPR90,"Eager for some new low-budget high fantasy, I ordered a Blu-ray version from Amazon's UK site for dirt cheap. Chagrintastically, I then discovered this film already in my collection under a different name, so...
As a public service announcement, let's clear up any confusion right here:

(original title) -- SAGA: Curse of the Shadow

UK (English title) (DVD box title) -- Rise of the Shadow Warrior

USA (alternative title) (English title) -- Curse of the Dragon Slayer

USA (alternative title) (English title) -- Dragon Lore: Curse of the Shadow

USA (English title) (new title) -- SAGA: Curse of the Shadow

World-wide (alternative title) (English title) -- SAGA: The Shadow Cabal

If I were feeling cynical this evening I would say a crafty filmmaker changed the name around to cause absentminded geeks like me to purchase the same flick twice. Maybe it was changed to have ""dragon"" in the title because ""dragon"" is a choice marketing term for this genre, but then they got sued by somebody and changed the name back to something about shadows?
Below, I'm just going to refer to it as ""Curse"" (short for ""SAGA: Curse of the Dragon Lore Slayer Shadow Cabal,"" or alternatively, ""Curse of the Many-named Movie"").

So is it worth watching? That depends on your viewing needs. Here are some details:

*Cinematography*
OUTSTANDING. Somebody cut their teeth with Curse, and Hollywood may take notice and scoop up the talent involved. Granted, Utah is intrinsically beautiful, but it still takes talent to scout out the perfect spot and to use camera angles that will make the most of natural splendor. The topography caught on film is lavishly varied, with forests, wetlands, and plenty of mountainous terrain. Going above and beyond the call of duty for a B movie, they even bothered to do some underwater scenes (featuring mermaids who curiously wear bikini tops made of synthetic material). On top of this, serious color grading during postproduction resulted in saturated landscapes and artificial darkness to provide for an otherworldly vibe.

*Actors*
""They cursed the wrong elf, and they're going to regret it,"" says Nemyt Akaia. Because she is just so damn telegenic that I don't want to imagine this flick without her, I'm reluctant to admit that Danielle Chuchran as the elf named Nemyt was perhaps miscast. According to IMDb, Danielle was ""born in Upland, California but moved to Utah shortly after."" Upland is dangerously close to actual Valley Girl territory, and at times you can't help but think of Nemyt Akaia as being a California elf. Anyway, she was competent in her scenes, and there's something oddly alluring about a girl like that who can spit so well (her elf spits at whomever she's currently disgusted with, which changes frequently). According to the final credits she had a body double, but humorously she also served as a ""Booty Double"" for the treacherous mermaids.
I will be seeking out Danielle Chuchran in leading roles elsewhere, and I selfishly hope that she doesn't gain fame and leave the B movie circuit.

Curse was Richard McWilliams' screen debut, and Richard did very well indeed as the protagonist Keltus the Wanderer.
Paul D. Hunt, who already had experience on the screen, also brings life to Curse as the frenemy orc Kullimon the Black, and he deserves extra credit for wearing what must have been uncomfortable facial prosthetics.

The stunning Bailee MyKell Cowperthwaite (she'll need to change her name if she wants to be a starlet) plays the prophetess, although by ""plays"" I mean she stands there looking solemn (nice work if you can get it) while another woman does her telepathic voice. Come to think of it, Bailee looks more like she belongs on the cover of Vogue than in a movie overflowing with orcs.

*Plot / Script*
Not mind-bending in the least, but if we're going to be charitable we can say it goes beyond simplistic and keeps the audience engaged. I'm just glad there was no actual ring involved, keeping Curse from being The Frenemies of the Ring (since it borrows so much from FotR already). The dialogue was written by two dudes who make it abundantly clear that Curse is concerned with genre and cinematography over launching the career of a screenwriter.

*Soundtrack*
A bit grandiloquent for a B movie, but I'd rather hear ambition than afterthought. Well done.

*Special Effects / CGI*
Hit or miss, but mostly adds to the credibility of Curse rather than detracting from it. There was a big fail in attempting to portray an undead minotaur (or demon or something) that had papier-mch hands, but that was the only disaster.

Family friendly? Well, if you are fine with your kid witnessing multiple decapitations but can't abide bare breasts on mermaids, then you've come to the right place. The mermaids are fully clothed and there are plenty of melee scenes that end with heads flying off.

Final thoughts: Somewhat superior to the Mythica film series, Curse is amusing if you're willing to overlook obvious but expected low-budget flaws... would have been a lot less fun without Danielle Chuchran as the valley girl elf.",1446422400,,5086,4.950704225352113

6284471,4,B00IORPR90,"This was a delightful surprise for me.  The three main characters, the Orc, the elf, and Keltus made a great team.  The story line was good and the special effects were very well done for a low budget movie.  The characters are likeable, the Southern Utah scenery was spectacular.  I recognized Goblin Valley, Zion area, and upper American Fork Canyon.  Danielle Chuchran as the sword swinging, arrow slinging elf was really fun, even if the supply of arrows in her quiver mysteriously increased as she needed them.

6284473,5,B00IORPR90,"This is a really great story! The film takes itself seriously and isn't stupid. If you can overlook the special effects (which aren't terrible) this is a really magnificent tale. It reminds me of  a LRP of D&D. For fans of the genre this is a treat. Serious and non-cliche movies of this sort are as rare as hens teeth!

 WARNING:If you cannot overlook the low budget or aren't a great fan of the genre then you will hate this film and think I am crazy.",1437955200,,453,4.244186046511628
6284474,5,B00IORPR90,"Another incredible performance by Miss Chuchran, she looked amazing as an elf and her martial arts skills were very good. I do martial arts myself and would love to have a sparing session with her, it would be entertaining.",1437350400,,223,4.743589743589744
6284475,3,B00IORPR90,"A complicated history of orcs, elves, dwarves, and humans is hinted at, but it's not made explicit.  It's kinda like a RPG where you're thrown in the middle of a story and you don't know what's going on other than the Shadow cult are up to no good.  They even have panoramic views of cliffs or deserts that reminds me of a loading screen.  I half expected to see written tips!

The movie feels like a labor of love, rather than trying to make a quick buck.  The special effects are very good for this kind of movie and the characters actually talk to each other!  Dialog isn't just used as filler between action scenes like other movies.  I didn't much like the Human cleric, but the orc steals the scenes he's in.  The female elf grows on you; and a big plus for me-- it looks like she does her own stunts.  I'm so sick of anorexic models making snarky comments after their stunt double does all the heavy lifting..

Towards the end of the movie especially, you got the sense that they were toying with turning this into a tv series.  I wish they would.  I'd love to see more with the dwarves-- they're very cool.  The main reason I'm not going higher than three stars is it feels a bit incomplete.  I'd love to see a new sword and sorcery series because everything since Legend of the Seeker (not counting GoT) sucks goblin balls.",1436486400,,1332,4.340080971659919

Well, that was the others....this was painful to the max. Just Bad. Richard was stiff but he was in the other one too so that is his thing, good to go! The support case were as wooden as end tables. The biggest offender to my sensibilities was this Danielle Chuchran....who and why did they dig her up!!!! Please let the word go forth throughout the land....don ont ever put her in a movie AGAIN. I grant you that the story was bad but it could have had some form of entertainment value.",1433808000,,702,4.366412213740458
6284478,4,B00IORPR90,"The story for Curse Of The Dragon Slayer is one that I am not familiar with but the company behind the film is also responsible for games and other movies in this ilk. I say that just to let it be known that fantasy adventure films are not my forte and although I find them entertaining they are not a world or mythos that I contemplate enough to have a personal checks-n-balances to validate what I the film intends. So my review is solely on this films value and merit alone. The good thing about Curse Of The Dragon Slayer is you don't really have to be that familiar with this world or they encompassing storyboard to enjoy the movie.

The quality of the acting, direction and story arch offer a pretty entertaining fantasy adventure with cool character dynamics that press beyond the clich that is this genres burden. The fact that the story combines unlikely characters as heroes is a plus. At times the burden of clich does hinder the concepts  plausibility (If you develop your characters to a set standard then they will hardly band together for a common goal-in my opinion). However that notion didn't stop me from enjoying this movie and guess what?, I found myself favoring the Orc more than the Elf and Human.

The special effects and creature make-up is pretty quality with an obvious attention to respect for the genre present from the creators. There are elements of CGI within Curse Of The Dragon Slayer but the film isn't co-dependent upon them and there are far more practical effects utilized. The atmosphere and cinematography for this one is pretty stellar with some beautiful scenes framed by awesome scenery and design.  The film took all the things I loved about the Tolkein films and combined it with a classic feel of one of my favorite fantasy films The Beast Master in a well crafted and nicely executed story. I found Curse OF The Dragon Slayer very entertaining and I think it works for all ages.",1432166400,,1927,4.642228739002933

Costuming isn't bad for a low budget film, FX are okay. I've seen a lot of movies with bigger name actors and more money poured into them that were much, much worse.

6284490,4,B00IORPR90,"Let's make one thing clear: this is a low budget, direct to video D&D inspired fantasy film. Judging it across budget boundaries, this film might only be a solid 2 of 5 stars. However, judged just within it's genre and budget range, it's one of the best of the B-movie fantasy films I've seen.

The visuals are good, especially for the budget. Good costuming, sets and makeup effects. Most of the CGI effects were lacking, which was a shame in an era where even a low budget film, with the proper CGI people and relatively low cost software/hardware can make some amazing effects. Still. production values were good for an obviously low budget film.

The acting, I felt, was better than average for a b-movie. Sometimes in these films the acting is unbearably bad, not so here.

The story and writing were, once again, above average for the low budget fantasy genre. Not perfect, but competent.

Overall, I found it enjoyable and I was definitely pleasantly surprised by how well they did with an obviously very low budget.

I always hate seeing low budget films that completely suck. I mean, you manage to get enough money to put something to (digital) film with a reasonable crew and cast, at least make some effort at decent writing, acting and directing. Maybe that's why I felt so generous with my Amazon rating score for the film. The film makers here at least tried to make a low budget fantasy film that didn't suck and they succeeded. I'm always willing to give low budget horror/sci-fi a shot, but low budget swords and sorcery flix are usually so horrible I don't even give watching them any thought.

I've watched a lot of independently developed fantasy/sci-fi movies, and this one is really quite well done. The plot is a standard, but that's not a problem. The character development was good, and the acting was pretty well done. The production values were excellent, I thought.  The characters were somewhat compelling, and the stunts were good, too. Had a terrific opening sequence as well. I would watch this again for sure. And if you buy the dvd, the extras are good.

If the movie started to suck or get boring, I would have turned it off without hesitation, but I kept watching. Mainly because the elf girl at first. When the Orc character shows up, I thought he would be cheesy, and he totally was, but it was a likable cheesy that was more enduring that what I thought it would be. The plot is nothing special, in fact, it seems to come out of every 90's era fantasy novel. A group of unlikely heroes, including a noble human male warrior and a sexy, mysterious and lethal elf warrior woman. I think I've read eighty, eight billion novels with that plot intro.

The characters are distinct with Kullimon being the most distinct character not just in this movie but in the genre considering orcs aren't cast as heroes in the same manner. I do hope to see another story take place in this world so it can be explored more but some of that is undoubtedly due to what was lacking early on because it does become fascinating and raises some intriguing questions. So I recommend Curse of the Dragon Slayer if you're willing to be patient with excessive fighting without a story, and this is coming from someone who loves action movies, because it is rewarding and will have you looking at the usual arrangements in the genre differently.",1406764800,,862,4.603896103896104
6284499,2,B00IORPR90,"Curse of the Dragon Slayer was one of those movie titles that caught my eye on a lazy summer afternoon.  Sadly, the title was the most exciting thing to happen to this movie.

Mediocre acting topped with pathetic attempts at make up and special effects draw the attention away from the story to the problems of the movie.  Several times I felt like calling it a day and giving up watching this film.  It took four different attempts at viewing in order for me to get beyond the bad and just watch the flick.  I should have stayed away.",1406678400,2,535,4.363636363636363
6284500,4,B00IORPR90,"Considering the low budget, I actually thought this was a pretty good movie. The special effects were probably the worst thing about it. Obviously it's not on the same level as Lord of the Rings but it's a hell of a lot better than many other fantasy movies I've seen over the years.",1406160000,,283,4.3584905660377355
6284501,4,B00IORPR90,"As a fantasy genre fan, I saw this in passing at Walmart (knowing it was a low(er) budget production), and took a chance as I occasionally do.

Though in honesty, a majority of the time these gambles rarely play out favorable to my taste.

This film was QUITE a welcome surprise, and really shows that a good entertaining fantasy offering can be produced on a small budget with strong direction and a talented staff.

If you're open to fantasy film or television offerings, definitely check this film out. It deserves some purchase applause and financial success recognition.

I would love to see films like this influence small production studious interested in similar projects, there is just entirely TOO MUCH time & money spent on movies that could offer much more with the right creative staffing, and this release proves it.",1406073600,7,830,4.9071428571428575
6284502,2,B00IORPR90,"I won't judge this film based on the fact that it is a low-budget independent film with many handicaps in comparison to other larger budget movies. Clearly the creators had access to some really nice cameras, some acceptable film locations, the vault of cast off Lord of the Rings costumes and makeups and some pretty decent actors. The potential for something great and message sending to the billion dollar Lord of the Rings franchise and big studios was all there, it just wasn't realized.

Fine, make a fantasy movie, but if you're going to use all the costumes and makeup from the Lord of the Rings vault at least alter them to make them unique. Fine, make a fantasy movie, but if you're going to use the Lord of the Rings costumes and makeups, how about trying to avoid things that reek of the Lord of the Rings.... like a crazy cave troll.... an elfish-female type character who speaks to other characters... with her mind... in nearly the exact same voice as Cate Blanchett from the Lord of the Rings.

How about making a film with some personality instead of being so convoluted that I can only compare it to ""Dune"". They should have issued a manual with the movie just so you can keep everything straight or know what people are talking about when they say stuff like this:  ""The shadow agent has the ashes of Amenkah (or something like that) and the blood of Gotha-Zool (?). He took the canteen I collected at the bleeding stone. When they are mixed together at the entrance of the underworld, they will raise a avatar of Gotha-zool lord of the dead. With him at their head, their legions swelling with the corpses they'll reanimate... etc. etc.""

All of the dialogue is like this. In fact, everything is over-acted and over-staged. Fight sequence are edited so loosely, you can actually see the actor for a split second waiting to hear 'action' before moving. The music plays through the film as if they want you to love this movie like the Lord of the Rings with such drama and importance, but you can't. They want you to care, but all you can do is watch mindnumbingly as they talk about things like you should know who and what they are talking about.

Movies should let their audience play along. It doesn't have to be dummied down until it is stupid or simple.... but it doesn't have to be ""DUNE"" and it should NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER make you think of another movie as you watch it at any time. Especially one as epic and memorable as the Lord of the RIngs. There are some good things about ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"", but movies like this disappoint me. It's 2014 and this is something that Roger Corman would have made in the 1970s. That's fine if that was what the creators intended, but it is obviously NOT what they intended.  They intended to be a more adult version of ""Lord of the Rings"" and while they certainly succeeded, they also succeeded in making a bad movie despite having all the right tools to make a good one.",1405814400,,2948,4.51123595505618
6284503,5,B00IORPR90,"Excellent film and story! The budget was well spent on visual effects and costume,  the acting is well done with some new faces!!! Warhammer instead of Tolkien.",1405296000,2,160,4.925925925925926
6284504,4,B00IORPR90,"I don't know what the deal is with Richard McWilliams movie titles.  This one is called both Curse of The Dragon Slayer and Saga: Curse of The Shadow.  His 2011 film Dawn Of The Dragon Slayer was also called Paladin.  At any rate I liked this one better.  I thought at first this was a sequel to Dawn Of The Dragon Slayer but it is not.  It is very well done, good fight scenes, good acting.  McWilliams plays Keltus the Wanderer who joins forces with an elf and an orc  to bring down the evil Shadow who is planning on bringing forth Goth Azul the Undead God.  The makeup is great and Paul D. Hunt is great as Kullimon the Orc and those bright blue eyes on Danielle Chuchran, Nemyt Akaisa the elf huntress, really makes her look hot.  While he does a good job, I still haven't warmed up to McWilliams yet.  This is a very good fantasy and well worth watching.",1405209600,,860,4.220858895705521
6284505,4,B00IORPR90,"Nicely done fantasy movie, from an independent producer. Though you don't have the type of CG effects from a Hollywood Blockbuster, it's still a decent movie. It just shows you don't have to have a major studio to make and produce a decent movie. I have a feeling once this overseas made movie circulates in the US, we will have a ""sleeper"" hit movie that will generate a good fan base.",1405036800,2,386,4.450704225352113

6284510,3,B00IORPR90,"Mainly for hardcore fantasy fans that don't mind trading a little production quality for some shmultzy fun and adventure.

This low budget fantasy manages to overcome some poor writing or dialog to create a modest story and some interesting visuals that can carry the show for the right fan.  Don't worry about reviews that try to draw too many comparisons with other epics.  This movie happens to have orcs, elves and dwarfs, but the quest is really not specifically like any other movie.  The dialog borrows a few devices briefly reminiscent of other shows that probably wasn't even necessary.  I took a chance on this show with low expectations and felt it was a terrific upside surprise.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  The flow is really quite simple.  Not particularly inventive, but absolutely not a knock off of any other show in my opinion.  It centers around a conflict of light and dark.  The Order vs. The Shadow.  The hero Keltus teams with a beautiful, butt kicking bounty hunter elf named Nemyt, and a deposed Orc leader to search out something called the vessel.  This small carved ivory looking device holds the power to resurrect an evil entity and enslave their world.  This is the goal of The Shadow.  A special mark is placed on recruits (or conscripts) to The Shadow and after time they succumb to a curse which makes them convert.  Nemyt is cursed with this mark after hunting and killing an Orc shaman for bounty at the very start of the show.  It is transferred to her unwillingly.  Part of the conflict in this story is her resistance to the curse and completing the quest before she succumbs.

Special effects are limited to a small amount of CGI and the entire movie is shot through a tinted, filtered lens (yea, that's about it).  That aside, they compensate with make-up and costuming that aren't too bad, along with some very nice locations and aerial shots you normally don't see in this low budget of a production. Some pretty nice scenery to be honest.  Also, some very nice artistic images such as the stark white backdrop with the Prophetess (oracle type figure) with light blue flowing robes.  The action isn't bad either and Nemyt quite frankly has some great moves!  A tiny bit of MMA combined with nice sword play on her part.  The hot warrior outfit, long platinum hair, and glowing blue eyes didn't hurt either!  Fight choreography was definitely above par - for the budget.

The acting as you would expect is a little second rate, but not so bad that it can't be enjoyed as long as you fit into the category of viewer I mentioned.  There will be a lot of people who won't make it through the movie and will hate it.  Their gripes are also valid.  This movie just isn't for everyone.  My intent is just to describe so the reader can decide where they fit in.  I suggest a rental.",1402963200,12,2815,4.605633802816901
6284511,4,B00IORPR90,"I just saw this movie on Netflix, and will be buying it. Considering the low budget, I really wasn't expecting much, but I found myself enjoying ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"" much more than I would have anticipated.

Honestly, as a D&D player, it felt like watching a campaign unfolding on screen. Orcs, clerics, old gods, undead, curses and an unlikely band of adventurers joining forces... everything an interesting campaign has to offer!

Bearing in mind that this -is- a low budget film, I would recommend it heartily to fantasy lovers, LARP-ers, and D&Ders.",1402876800,6,561,4.957446808510638
