8529686,4,B008QOXG58,"These reviews can be misleading. There are really 2 parts; the technical quality of the movie (sets, location, viewing quality, sound quality, video, transfer etc., and then the actual movie itself; directing, acting, story, staging, etc...I gave this offering overall (both parts of the movie) 4 stars because it is one of my favorite Randolph Scott movies which is hard to come by these days. A good, somewhat unique story, good supporting cast and well put together for it's time. The story was derived from a Zane Grey novel so it had a good start as well.  The technical quality is a different issue; It just not very good at all, just ok at best. Mostly because the transfer was not high quality so the sound and picture are not as good as could and should be these days. But if you like Randolph Scott and have not seen this movie, it's still worth a view.",1455753600,5,863,4.532051282051282
