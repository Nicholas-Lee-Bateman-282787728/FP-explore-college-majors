5552651,5,B00B1W0BQE,"I started doing Chris's workouts on Exercise TV and loved them!  This series is also great.  The half hour flies by and the exercises are not complicated, just effective!  It's a workout that gets you motivated  and when you are done you are sweating and feeling great.  I highly recommend this product.",1373673600,2,303,4.75

5552654,5,B00B1W0BQE,I Love Chris Freytag! I have EVERY WORK OUT at this point she has done!! She kicks my butt! I always think....I Can't do this ..in the beginning. BUT she gets me in shape and sweating right with her within a few weeks! I am 60 and have worked out with Chris's DVD'S for 10 years! No One Does it Better!,1366502400,26,302,3.9672131147540983
5552655,3,B00B1W0BQE,"Chris is one of my favorite exercise instructors.

You get a good aerobic workout - but not muscle.  If you want to burn alot of calories in a short amount of time and build stamina this is it.

 If you want to do interval with good muscle work out THIS IS NOT A GOOD WORKOUT.

You work each muscle group for 20 second intervals - while doing an aerobic portion.  Four sets of 20 seconds with 10 second recovery.

I love interval workouts which combine muscle work and aerobic but this series moves to fast through each set to really give your muscles a good workout.",1360108800,14,567,4.2924528301886795
5552656,5,B00B1W0BQE,"This is a nice set of varied Tabata interval workouts. Disc 1 has 4 Tabata interval workouts: upper body, lower body, total body, and core. Each workout is structured with a warm up, cool down, and 5 Tabata intervals. Chris guides you through the intervals which have 4 exercises each, combining plyometrics and weights. Each interval repeats the set of 4 exercises twice. There is a short 10 second rest period between exercises and a 45 second recovery period between intervals. I like these workouts because they come in at about 30 minutes. Also, even though they are difficult and challenge you, they are do-able. Chris offers low impact options throughout, but I've found I can do some of the plyometric exercises without switching to low impact. The second disc offers a few bonus workouts: one for core and one for glutes and thighs, and a yoga workout. My only real complaint is that the cool down on some of the Tabata routines feels a little rushed.  Overall, this is an excellent set for the price and provides solid workouts with lots of options.",1359676800,40,1059,4.755434782608695
5552657,5,B00B1W0BQE,Great dvd.  Good workouts for an intermediate exerciser.,1485907200,2,56,6.0
5552658,5,B00B1W0BQE,"These workouts do not use extreme moves that an average person cannot do. I was able to do all of the exercises; however, I do have a sore boots. Lol",1481155200,,149,4.0
5552659,5,B00B1W0BQE,"I love this DVD set. Chris Freytag is energetic without being annoying. She's motivating and has a great personality. The workout itself is good for intermediate exercisers with intervals that are pretty challenging, but not as hard as a super intense interval workout. The intervals are not all cardio, like I'm used to, but instead a mix of high/lower intensity moves, some being with weights or on a mat. I like the great variety of workouts to choose from, I don't follow the calendar or do this workout every day (I own hundreds of exercise DVDs) but instead throw them in for some variety from my harder workouts, but that's not to say these workouts are easy! They are not! I also really like the second DVD that has the buns and abs workouts. I don't really do the buns but I do the abs quite often, even when I do a different cardio workout. It's probably my favorite core/abs routine. It's 10 minutes long, but 10 effective minutes. This is definitely a good, fun workout for intermediate exercisers, but there are also low impact modifications for beginners. This is definitely a worthy addition to my DVD library.",1476662400,,1125,4.686868686868687
5552660,5,B00B1W0BQE,I really like Chris Freytag's videos. She is encouraging and easy to follow. This series gives me a great work out and variety without spending an excessive amount of time.,1468540800,2,172,4.766666666666667
5552661,5,B00B1W0BQE,"I have been doing at-home workouts for a couple of years now (left the gym), and I always like to try new DVDs to mix it up a bit, while keeping a group of DVDs in a regular rotation.  I have tried Jillian Michaels DVDs but not doing them anymore, as I don't care for how she sequences moves, and she talks too much and it gets annoying.  I am new to HIIT workouts but have been a fan of Chris Freytag's, and this collection of workouts really fit the bill for me!  I like her sequencing, she does all the workouts WITH you, and she is great at instructing each move.  I felt the workouts were a perfect  fit for me time-wise and challenging as well -- but without feeling like I'm killing myself and hurting my body.  NOTE: The warm up is longer than other workouts I have done (about 4-5 minutes). but I think this is due to the nature of what is required for these HIIT workouts  The only negative I will say, is that the cool down seems a bit short, so afterwards I do feel the need to continue to stretch out a bit more.  Give it a try!",1462752000,15,1041,4.04390243902439
5552662,5,B00B1W0BQE,"It is great to move your body around in different ways and directions other than the same old forward-linear direction. Running is my go to exercise and I needed to give my body a break and change the daily pounding. The variety in workouts keeps the boredom at bay, and the 30 minute time frame is just enough to give a workout but not take up too much time from your day. since I am a bit more masochistic, the workouts serve as a pre-run ""warm-up"" on weekends.

5552666,5,B00B1W0BQE,"Excellent narrative with great exercises.  Chris Freytag gives modifications to make it easier or  more difficult.  I think the cool down stretching could be extended, but in reality, I do my own stretching afterward anyway.  I would highly recommend this series.  Save the money on going to classes and do it at home!",1437177600,,318,4.9245283018867925
5552667,5,B00B1W0BQE,"Chris Freytag is one of my absolute favorite trainers. She's every bit as hard as Jillian Michaels, but unlike Jillian, Chris seems to be enjoying herself. Don't get me wrong--Jillian is fab, but if you're someone who needs a little extra motivation, a trainer who's having fun really helps. The thing I like about HIIT is that not only is it an hour-long workout crammed into thirty minutes, but it stays hard even when you're past the beginning stage. Add extra weight and one or two of the mini-workouts, and you're good to go. I've been doing Freytag's HIIT series for over a year, and have had to start buying smaller clothes because my old ones are too baggy. Yay! I hope she puts out a second volume of HIIT, because this is AWESOME! :-)",1436572800,11,744,4.518518518518518

5552673,5,B00B1W0BQE,A very good way to mix up work outs. You can push as hard as you want or she modifies. I could tell a difference in my muscles and stamina in 2 weeks. I also do Jillian and several others so this dvd is a nice addition!!,1419033600,,220,3.702127659574468

5552675,4,B00B1W0BQE,"I really enjoyed this workout dvd.  I am prone to injuries and found that it was presented in a safe way (although the modifications could have been better shown).  I found the workout effective and doable and Chris Freytag is motivating.  I gave it four stars because I just wished there was another full length whole body workout to alternate with.  There are shorter target area workouts, but I prefer whole body ones best.  So good...wished there was more.",1412121600,3,460,4.772151898734177
5552676,5,B00B1W0BQE,I work out 5-days a week and I love a challenge. This workout is wonderful. The CD has a series of options to choose from and they are all hard! I am always sweating after this workout and after having it for over a year it still challenges me. I love the fact that you are doing things with weights as well as cardio so your heart really starts pumping. Great Video!,1411948800,5,367,4.111111111111111

5552678,5,B00B1W0BQE,"I never get bored with these workouts. I started with very light weights and as the exercises are getting easier I am upping my weights so it is always challenging. The hardest workout is the lower body one in my opinion, when I finish that last exercise I feel so accomplished and STRONG! Chris is so motivational and easy to follow!!! Five BIG stars!!!",1406505600,2,354,4.546875
5552679,5,B00B1W0BQE,"This is my new favorite workout DVD along with Chris Freytag's 10 LB Slimdown.  Each HIIT workout is 30 minutes and there's a bonus DVD with 10 minute lower body and 10 minute abs plus a 20 minute vinyasa yoga segment.  The time seems to pass quickly with these workouts because the segments are short and difficult but then you're on to something else, so no single muscle group is too exhausted to do the next segment.  Chris Freytag has to be my favorite workout DVD instructor.  She's encouraging, motivating, and pleasant.  I do her DVDs more often than any of my others because of her personality along with the excellent workout.",1404259200,11,636,4.642857142857143
5552680,5,B00B1W0BQE,"I'd love to get this workout, but why is it still soooo expensive here?  I think the price came down awhile ago, and I've been waiting for Amazon to price match!!!!  Not yet!!  Boo!",1394582400,3,181,4.264705882352941
5552681,5,B00B1W0BQE,"We really love this DVD, due to the choices of workouts- 4 hiit ones, plus another bonus DVD. These workouts are intense, and push you to keep correct form while performing the exercises and breathing hard. Chris is a great instructor, who lets you know what's coming, shows you modifications, and does the whole workout with you- no walking around and just showing you moves. I have done many, many exercise DVDs over the years, and Chris Freytag may be my favorite instructor, for her down-to-earth, real style.",1383177600,3,513,4.840909090909091
5552682,3,B00B1W0BQE,"I love Chris Freytag. This work out kicks butt but it is not for someone with bad knees and/or a bad back. I have both and was unable to fully do all the moves, even with modifications. I still think it is a good workout and you will be tired and sweaty by the end of it.",1381708800,5,271,3.7719298245614037
5552683,5,B00B1W0BQE,"This is a tough but manageable workout DVD for those who enjoy HIIT workouts. There two DVDs in the case. One DVD has the four HIIT workouts (upper body, lower body, total body and core) and the other has the bonus workouts. Weights are recommended for all four HIIT workouts, but you can definitely do the workouts without weights. Because these exercises are done at a fairly quick pace, you may need to lighten up on your weights. If you are not familiar with Tabata sytle HIIT, this means you go full steam (and I mean push yourself to your limit) for 20 seconds and then rest for 10 seconds, then you do it all over again for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds until you reach 4 minutes. I have done other Tabata workouts, and these workouts are not as intense/fast paced as some others. That doesn't mean I walked through these with any ease though; I sweated..a lot. I also felt that lower body workout for a few days after.

What I really like about this workout is that you cycle through a series of exercises twice to hit the full 4 minute interval. It makes it less boring than other Tabata workouts where you do the same exercise 8X in a row. I also like the 30 minute time frame -- actual workouts are probably just over 20 minutes. Chris Freytag is still her fantastic self -- motivating and cheerful without being annoying or overly talkative. My one complaint is the cueing of interval stop times. Chris is not always clear as to when the 20 seconds are up and in many exercises, you shouldn't crane your neck to keep an eye on the timer. Now I know doing these exercises in such quick sessions is not easy to cue, but having a beep go off at the end of the 20 seconds would have been helpful. I guess you can supplement with your own timer if you wanted to be more precise. Chris offers modifications for most, if not all, the exercises so there are options for those who want to keep the impact low. I probably wouldn't recommend to someone who is just getting into exercise, but someone who is ready to take their workout up a notch may enjoy this quite a bit. The cool down segments for all the HIIT workouts are too short in my opinion, especially after such intense exercise. I usually take some more time to bring my heart rate down before I go into the stretches.

As a side note, I am not sure why this DVD is being sold at such an outrageous price on Amazon. As of this review, the price was showing up as $45.99! These are still available a fraction of the price from other sellers.",1381536000,24,2509,4.313559322033898
5552684,5,B00B1W0BQE,I love this DVD.  Chris is tough and very motivating.  She does the whole workout with you.  You can pick and choose the length of your workout or the area you want to focus on each time.,1381104000,,187,4.0

8561135,5,B00B1W0BQE,"This is a great workout! There are some high impact moves, but she shows you modifications (and even if you modify, you still get a workout). You will definitely sweat and I can see and feel a difference when I do it regularly! My only complaint is that I don't care for the Core HIIT DVD. It focuses too much on the sides of your core and not enough on the middle. Otherwise, great purchase and the other 3 workouts are fantastic!",1529366400,,431,4.2682926829268295
8561136,5,B00B1W0BQE,"Very challenging workout and efficient use of time. There is one spot where the audio has a buzzing noise to it, but otherwise a very good quality video.

8561140,1,B00B1W0BQE,"I am such a big Chris Freytag fan, that it's hard for me to write a negative review of one of her dvds.  But, despite Chris' delightful and motivating personality, I found this workout just sooooo repetitive and boring.  Yes, I suppose that is what Tabata style workouts are all about.  But I hated doing this dvd.  I have over 250 exercise dvds, and know that I will never include this one in my rotations, because of the dread factor for me.  When I am exercising, I have a smile on my face most of the time.  Chris had a beautiful smile on her face, but I just couldn't join her.  Sorry, Chris!  I do hope that you will come out with more dvds in the future, because I remain a fan!!!",1500336000,,687,4.151515151515151

8561144,5,B00B1W0BQE,"I like Chris' personality, as I have one of her Prevention (abs) DVDs.  I saw this HIIT series got a great rating from others, so I was excited to try it.  I really like having several different HIITs to choose from and the DVD is set up so that you can easily switch between workouts. I also love the 10 minute Belly Blast bonus.  It's only 10 minutes, but the exercises are intense and challenging and I really feel as though I worked my abs when I'm done. I do wish that the workouts were a little longer (I typically work out for an hour in the morning), but I just do 2 of them instead of one.
