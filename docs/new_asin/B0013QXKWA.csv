8252656,4,B0013QXKWA,"Muchachas, Muchachas, Muchachas - Girls, Girls, Girls and the Boys who chase them!!! This is a very light humorous sexy-comedy with enough PICARDIA (spice) to keep the laughs rolling. Of special mention the ULTRA-SEXY MEXICAN ACTRESS Ms. ROSA MARIA VAZQUEZ (El bom-bom) THIS YOUNG WOMAN LOOKED REEEEAAAALYYYY GOOOOD WEARING BIKINIS!!!! ONE OF MY ALL-TIME BEAUTIFUL FAVORITE ACTRESSES!!!!!! Nothing offensive in the story of a group of young women stranded in the middle of nowhere when their car breaks down and are rescued by the ULTRA-HANDSOME SHIRTLESS MUSCLEMAN Mr. ANDRES GRACIA who drives the girls into town to a hotel. The people in town mistake them for STRIPPERS since a different group of women were supposed to arrive there earlier. The movie manages to be sexy, funny and all the young ladies true eye candy without being explicit JUST PLENTY OF PRETTY WOMEN PARADING IN BIKINIS!!!! The movie was made in the late 60's before Mexico's cinema was transitioning to more grossout comedies. Too bad because with the advent of VHS home video the movie industry in Mexico collapsed. No english subtitles. The color & sound are of acceptable quality.",1424995200,2,1156,5.121693121693122
