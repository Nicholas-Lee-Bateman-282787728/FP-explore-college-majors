8408223,5,B003XKKSII,"I am a fan of Angela Bettis . This movie surprised me . It was very different from what I expected .It reminded me a little of Truly Madly Deeply, which is one of my favorite films .I also enjoyed the music by Califone. It's a little of beat for everyone but I do enjoy off beat and obscure movies that are done well .",1428710400,,318,3.9076923076923076
8408224,3,B003XKKSII,"One thing that people will never grow tired of speculating about is death. What happens to us? Where do we go? What is waiting for us?

""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" never really asks those questions. Instead, this delicate, dreamlike film focuses on a house full of ""funeral ghost"" ghosts, and a young lady who lives alongside them. The first half is a meandering, messy nonplot, but it later gels into a haunting meditation on

Zel (Angela Bettis) lives in her late grandmother's old house, but not alone. For many years, she has lived with several ghosts, including a suicidal bride, a flapper, a randy priest, an embittered actor, a blind band that plays music all day, and a silent little girl. By day, Zel works as a psychic and a medium, while the ghosts meander about their own business.

Then one day, the ghosts see a bright light outside, and attempt to go into it... you know, the way dead people are supposed to. But they're unable to leave the house. They jump to the conclusion that Zel has somehow trapped them inside the house, and decide to make her life a misery until she releases them... but the truth is rarely so simple.

The first half of ""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" is kind of a mess -- everybody just meanders around aimlessly, chitchatting and occasionally doing little dances. And while the direction is lovely, we have these interludes where we just see the ghostly musicians diddling around on various instruments.

But once the ghosts demand their freedom, their story quietly gels together with Zel's, blossoming into a soft, bittersweet little finale. Director Tim Rutili wraps the entire movie in a sort of blurry twilight atmosphere, with wobbly camerawork and little superstitions that pop up between scenes. The haunting direction fits the story, and adds the feeling that Zel's house is its own little world.

And Angela Bettis gives a brilliant, understated performance as a young woman who, because of the ghosts that form her ""family,"" has never really gotten to be a part of the living world. She can't even make out with her boyfriend without the dead crowding her, and mortal dangers don't seem to register. We see Zel when she's frazzled, when she's sad, and eventually when she is embarking on a new life.

If there's a problem with the characterization, it's that the ghosts feel underdeveloped -- the actors are quite good, especially the suicidal bride, the stately muttonchop-wearing man, and the languid flapper. But we don't hear much about them except their deaths.

""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" drags for its first half, only to blossom into a dried white rose in its second half. Worth seeing, if you like experimental films.",1280966400,4,2704,4.837662337662338
