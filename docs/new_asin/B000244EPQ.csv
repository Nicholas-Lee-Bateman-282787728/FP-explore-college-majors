Just the fact that it was produce by Madacy is all you need to know about its abysmal quality.

If you look that program  up on amazon.com you will see the poor reviews that it has...",1304553600,4,269,4.115384615384615

Ditto everything the other reviewers have written, with the addtion of this note:

For a collection featuring the SR-71 Blackbird on the cover, it is not even mentioned on any of the four discs.

What a disappointment.",1167696000,10,262,5.046511627906977
2061565,2,B000244EPQ,"Had I realized this was a Madacy production before I bought it, I would have made a different decision. I learned long ago to avoid Madacy titles because of their poor production quality, but there was nothing on the box indicating Madacy involvement (it is there but almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass). The packaging was quite spectacular, unlike Madacy titles I had purchased in the past. Metal case with color printing and there was even a wonderful full-color book inside outlining many of the great pioneers of aviation and their aircraft with superb production quality. So, I was unprepared for the poor quality of the video content inside. I own many of the videos from disc 4 in VHS format, and could not believe how badly these have been reproduced on DVD. I can do a better job of transferring the VHS to DVD using my analog-to-digital converter! As other reviewers have pointed out (too bad I saw these posts after my purchase), the documentary is not organized in any meaningful pattern and fails to deliver on its promise of describing the history of aviation.",1167004800,10,1092,4.8138297872340425
2061566,4,B000244EPQ,"With some minor flaws, for less than $ 20, this is a good collection of aviation history.

Going from the orginal, which has probably been copied several times, to DVD some quality has been lost, but still preserves the history of aviation and the type of movie photography for that time.  Even though some main events of aviation history are not covered.

Anyone wanting a basic knowledge of aviation, and how it developed, this collection, you can't go wrong for the price.

2061567,2,B000244EPQ,"I had great hope for this 4-disk video set. It was beautifully packaged in a well-designed plastic 4-disk folder which was placed in a beautifully illustrated metal can case. Unfortunately, the contents fell far short of my expectations.  While it was reasonably well produced and showed much interesting footage, it suffered from a number of faults, the principal being its predominant emphasis on warfare, some of which, particularly the coverage of the First World War, was only loosely connected to aviation.  During the first 100 years of aviation, major warfare entailed perhaps 10 of those years, mostly the two World Wars, yet, the first two disks are almost entirely devoted to those two conflagrations with relatively minimal coverage of the period of initial development and the development that took place between the wars, to say absolutely nothing of the post-WWII era. There always seemed to be a sense of hurry to get back to one war or another. In general, there was a lack of depth, skimming over many significant events, in the rush to get back to battle. There were errors in presentation that any aviation buff would be sure to catch, such as discussing one aircraft while showing another, sometimes even from another era.  With the many thousands of hours of historic film available it's hard to understand why the producers felt it necessary to show many of the same cuts repeatedly during several of the discussions. The sequencing was disjointed often leading the viewer to ask, ""how did we get here?""  The third disk was devoted to space exploration.  Moving from the second disk to the third suffered from some of the same sense of disjoint leaving one to think that not too much went on in aviation during the period after WWII ended. However, of the four disks, this one was, nevertheless, by far the best.  With the exception of a somewhat incongruous insertion of a segment on Chuck Yeager's historic flight beyond the sound barrier, the disk followed a timely sequence from Goddard to the moon landings, giving all of the appropriate nods to the Russian accomplishments along the way (they were, after all, first, if not best, in many areas - first satellite in space, first man in space, first woman in space, first space station - where most other U.S.-produced histories of space flight have tended to gloss over those embarrassing facts).  The final, fourth ""bonus"" disk was a hodge-podge of films and clips ranging from another mini-doc of Chuck Yeager, to a copy of the famous original WWII film Memphis Belle (which, inexplicably, while originally shot in Technicolor, was reproduced here in black and white).  Lacking depth and continuity while being obsessed with warfare did not lend itself to my finding it particularly entertaining.  But that's just me. Overall, on a scale of one to five, I'd give it a two.  Moderately interesting, a bit more frustrating.  But, hey, it was only $29 bucks - waddya' expect?",1144108800,7,2952,4.943434343434343

2061569,1,B000244EPQ,"An aviation buff, I thought I could not go wrong getting this 4-DVD documentary for less than $20.  I was wrong.  This is far from the documentary quality one can find on the History and Discovery channels, in fact it actually reminded me of the murky and dull 16mm films seen in school (half a century ago) as a feeble gesture toward audio-visual ""education"".

Most of the early archival film clips didn't look as good as similar clips seen on TV, while the newer clips were almost uniformly unsharp or in bad color.  The narration was half-decent, but overall the visual quality was so lacking this entire production seemed a distinctly amateur project done on a shoestring.

I had been fooled into thinking this DVD set might be a quality item because of the packaging in a neat metal case.  I might as well keep the case and throw away the DVDs.  The DVD publisher Madacy is one I DEFINITELY will try to avoid in future.",1104278400,24,924,4.530120481927711

8021809,1,B000244EPQ,"I actually mistakened this DVD set for The Century Of Flight made by Time Life Video in the late 1990s. (Please make THIS series in DVD format!). When you look at the two, there is virtually no comparison. Madacy's A Century of Flight covers very little about the history of aerial warfare. It has a brief segment on World War I; World War II takes up a whole disc but is told only from the American point-of-view. Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War are not covered at all! The series only covers the history of U.S aviation, exempting of course the topics listed above. My verdict: the series seems like something an elementary school class might find interesting (only because they'd rather watch TV than do written assignments) but to someone seriously interested in aviation; like the previous review says: Avoid at all costs.",1307145600,8,828,4.756944444444445
