7885962,5,6305251525,"From 1967 an animator named Ralph Baski did the first few entries in this series. More than any other cartoon at the time; with the exception of Hanna Barbera's Fantastic Four cartoon, these cartoons followed the comics more than not.  I love the scenes where Spidey swings through New York City.  It is primative by today's standards but brings back lots of memories for me because I loved those cartoons. I can only wish that Marvel makes a complete DVD set of this classic.  Only thing is I don't believe so because no one is interested.  This one was ahead of its time because it tapped into the superhero in all of us.",1022284800,,623,4.486725663716814
7885963,4,6305251525,"Not really being a big fan of cartoons, Spiderman is a rare exception.  Even though the animation isn't ""Walt Disney"" quality, it is still very enjoyable to watch.  The only criticism, which has been mentioned before in other reviews, is that the tape is too short.  It would have been nice to have 8 episodes on a 2 hr tape instead of just 2 episodes making it only have a runtime of 35 minutes.  20th Century did a nice job on the clamshell case and the artwork.  Also, offering it in SP mode, and not in EP, like most of the tapes of TV shows seem to be recorded in, was nice too.  Even though the tape isn't that long, it's still worth the money to have as a keepsake for fans of Spiderman.",1002672000,2,694,4.141791044776119
7885964,4,6305251525,"It has become increasingly rare when a movie or television version of a character of literary descent (particularly of comic book origins) remains even remotely faithful to its source material. This video is a rare exception to that trend. If you are a lover of the Stan Lee/ Steve Ditko comics that established the entire Spider-Man world this is a real treat of a video.  Despite some limited animation (it was the sixties remember), this video compilation shows what Spider-man is all about. Watching the origin episode made me wonder why the whole ""with great powers comes great responsibility"" angle was removed from all the subsequent screenings of this tragic hero.  I would like to see some follow-ups to this release. The theme song alone brands it as a classic. My only reservation on this video is its short length, only two episodes. otherwise five stars",995328000,2,866,4.924657534246576

I LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF THIS TAPE.
BUY IT!",978998400,,83,4.6
7885966,4,6305251525,"I bought this video last year. Its about 45 minutes long.  It faithfully tells the story how Peter Parker became Spider-man. He goes to a science demonstration. Check's out an experiment and get's bitten by a radioactive spider. Later, he goes for a walk to get some air, and finds that he can cling to walls just like a spider."" Kiliwatt Kaper"", is the return of Electro. He want's to drain all of NY cities power, and hold it for ransom. Can Spidey stop Electro in time!  Watch this episode & find out!",969494400,4,504,4.408602150537634
7885967,5,6305251525,"Except for THE THING, SPIDER-MAN UNLIMITED, and X-MEN: EVOLUTION, Marvel  Comics animation from the late-1970's (THE FANTASTIC FOUR) to the present  (THE AVENGERS) ranged from fairly good to really great. However, the best  shows always lie in the Silver Age. My (20th Century) Fox home video picks  are THE INCREDIBLE HULK, IRON MAN, THE MIGHTY THOR, and---still my all-time  favorite---SPIDER-MAN from Grantray-Lawrence and Krantz Animations.  Speaking of Spidey's first series, ""The Origin..."" was the true,  classic adaptation of his first appearance in AMAZING FANTASY # 15 that  could put that SPIDER-MAN: CHAPTER ONE ""revamp"" to pitiful shame,  and ""..Kaper"" was a lightning-fast, ""Electro-fying""  battle with his archfoe ever seen. I definitely recommend the video  collection to every Marvel-ite out there because---hey, let's face it---the  old school's the true school. Now, how cool would it be be if the Fantastic  Four's first series from Hanna-Barbera Productions was released on Warner  Home Video? 'Nuff said, true believers!",960249600,4,1042,5.638709677419355
7885968,5,6305251525,"Stan Lee was certainly proud when the Marvel heroes made thier animated TV debuts in the mid 1960's. Spider-Man remains the best of this series which ran two seasons on ABC.This video is a  treasure to me! the two episodes are  in comic-book style form. The cartoon animation wasn't flashy, but good for  it's time. Excelsior! Stan Lee!!!",934761600,4,338,4.793103448275862
