3698181,5,B001MM3AZM,"I saw this today on DVD after not being sure if I should bother to see it in theaters, and I gotta say that I liked it.

The story is about these two high school seniors that don't know eachother but meet up one night by chance. Then story elements from Nora's drunk friend and Nick's prying bandmates to a creepy older guy who's into Nora and Nick's interfering ex-girlfriend end up getting Nick and Nora closer together as the night in New York progresses and everyone searches for a secret performance being given by everyone's favorite band, 'Where's Fluffy?'.

The real reason to watch this movie is for the relationship between Nick & Nora. I enjoyed the banter between them and the fact that they seemed to have realistic chemistry. For that matter all the character's had very realistic and relatable chemistries with humorous banter that was always derived from character. It was also nice to see two teens that actually had some sense of moral and head's on their shoulder's. These character's are very down to earth rather than the over dramatic and foolish character's we are used to seeing teens portrayed as lately.

This movie does a great job of not pandering to one audience or another and seems more like it is just showing us the events that took place between these particular people on this particular night, allowing everyone to find humor where they want to see it. To me this movie tread the line of reality and heightened reality better than most seeming very grounded and realistic. I enjoyed this movie letting you laugh when you wanted to, and taking time to let scenes and dialogue play out without ever letting it play out too long or be boring or pointless. Also instead of jumping all over the place plotwise like certain other movies in this genre do this one actually had a coherent overall story and every plot turn made sense while it moved along at a brisk pace. Like most movies you can see where this one is going but it's the journey not the destination.

I really enjoyed this movie and hope others wondering about it will take a chance on it. The character dialogue is very well written, especially the scenes between Nick & Nora, the ones at the recording studio and when they meet back up in the third act and walk through the city being among my favorite. The music is aimed, like so many other movies lately, at the Indie/College Coffee Shop crowd but seems more appropriately placed here. The character's are cast perfectly and the wonderfully chosen location of New York City at night feels like a character on it's own and looks amazing. If you've been wondering about this movie give it a shot. Just My Opinion. Thanks For Your Time.

The DVD has two commentaries. One by Michael Cera, Kat Dennings, Ari Graynor, and the film Director. Another by the people who wrote the book this film is based on, along with the movie scriptwriter and again the Director. There are also Outtakes, Deleted Scenes, A 'Nick & Nora Puppet Show' by Kat Dennings, A Playful Interview of Dennings and Cera, a short Behind The Scenes Video Diary from Ari Graynor and a Music Video for ""Middle Managament"" by Bishop Allen.

""The World Has Been Broken Up Into Pieces And It's Our Job To Put It Back Together Again."" ""Maybe We Are The Pieces.""",1233619200,3,3268,4.625862068965517
3698182,2,B001MM3AZM,"The entire time I was watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, ""What am I missing?"" This critical darling is cute, but beyond predictable. There is no new ground broken here. Nick pines for his shallow ex-girlfriend while Nora stays with her shallow ex-boyfriend because it's comfortable. They are pushed together by Nick's friends (the only characters in the movie of any interest were the three gay friends) while they all search for a secret concert by their favorite band, Where's Fluffy.

Nick realizes the ex-girlfriend isn't as awesome as Nora, and the happy ending comes when they realize they'd rather spend time together than see Where's Fluffy. Yawn.

My one enduring memory of this movie won't be the performances or the story. It will be the ongoing ""joke"" where several characters share a piece of gum that has, amongst other things, ended up being fished out of a toilet at the Port Authority after one character has thrown up, and popped right back into her mouth.

If you are a teenager, this movie is right up your alley. Otherwise, you'll probably find it's better than the average teen fare, but you'd be better served by choosing a better movie in the genre (anything by John Hughes will do).",1233532800,12,1219,4.822966507177034
3698183,3,B001MM3AZM,"Following his role in the successful independent teen film, Juno, Michael Cera tries for a hit movie again in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.  He stars as Nick O'Leary, who is nearly the exact same person as his character in Juno, Paulie Bleeker, except less interesting. The rest of the film has the same feel: mundane.

 The story begins with Nick and his attempts to get back his hot but shallow ex-girlfriend, Tris (Alexis Dziena), by making mix tapes of his favorite songs. But, Tris is disinterested and tosses them in the trash. Along comes Norah (Kat Dennings), a friend of Tris who digs in the trash for Nick's CDs. Later that night and by pure coincidence, Tris and Norah come to the same club that Nick's band is playing at. After being ridiculed by Tris and her new boyfriend for being single, Norah asks a guy she thinks is cute to pretend to be her boyfriend for five minutes. However, to Norah's surprise the boy she chose is Nick. The convoluted plot soon adds in a drunken friend, the homeless, a band called Where's Fluffy, and a cringe-inducing restroom scene. These varying story lines somehow are able to combine ridiculously clichd scenes with numerous non sequiturs.

 This PG-13 movie attempts to be a Judd Apatow film for preteens while still having a heartfelt message of finding your ""true love"". It fails miserably on both accounts. Throughout the teens' escapades in New York City, the characters make explicit joke without being explicit. And when they do use the occasionally off-color humor, it usually falls flat.

 Another missed opportunity is the film's soundtrack. With a title like Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, it's almost a given that it will have great bands and songs throughout. Sadly, the filmmakers used independent bands that are based in New York to fit the theme of the film. These artists are independent for a reason: they aren't good.

 For all its faults, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist has one positive aspect: its stars. All the female leads (Dennings, Dziena and Ari Graynor) are able to keep the film watchable and sometimes humorous. Cera has a few great moments, as does newcomer Jonathan Wright, who plays Lethario. The actors look genuinely happy doing their parts and seem like there are having a good time, unlike the viewers.

 Whether you should watch this movie or not is purely up to your film tastes. If you're in the mood for just a relatively mindless popcorn flick, it's a good option. Other than that, give it a miss.",1233273600,6,2502,4.808857808857809
3698184,5,B001MM3AZM,"I actually dig this film a lot!  And the Blu-ray just made me love ""Nick & Norah's INFINITY PLAYLIST"" even more!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in 1080p high definition (1:85:1).  The picture quality was great!  A lot of the film is shot outdoors during the night but everything looked very good, no low light noise or fragmenting.  In fact, I didn't really pickup on much noise at all, considering a lot of the footage was shot outdoors.  There are really cool uses of color throughout the film and the colors were definitely vibrant.  You get a lot of nice blues and ambers, in certain scenes.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and the film is dialogue-driven and music-driven.  Dialogue was very clear and understandable but the music plays a significant part of this film and the music definitely comes alive on film.  Because music plays a prevalent role in the film, your front speaker channels definitely comes alive with the Dolby True HD soundtrack.

Both video and audio on Blu-ray for ""Nick & Norah's INFINITE PLAYLIST"" was fantastic!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Nick & Norah's INFINITE PLAYLIST"" is fully loaded when it comes to features.  I was very impressed of how much was crammed into one disc and definitely stoked!  It's one thing to really enjoy the film but to enjoy it even more because of the special features.  Included are:

# CineChat - If one has BD Live (the able to connect your Blu-ray player to the Internet), you can send onscreen instant messages to your friends around the world while watching the film at the same time.
# Interactive Playlist - Also, you can create and share a playlist of your favorite songs from the film via the Interactive Playlist.  Also, with the Interactive Playlist, you can see the song being played ala a music player one one side and then tidbits on the film on the other.  The sharing of songs requires BD Live but the player and info. segment of the film will load on normal profile 1.1 Blu-ray players.
# Telestrator Commentary with Director and Cast - The commentary with director Peter Sollett, Michael Cera, Kat Dennings and Ari Graynor was probably one of the wildest commentary I have ever listened to.  Also, you can watch the director and cast draw and point to items.  The group really wanted to keep the commentary fun and enjoyable and really discussed interesting tidbits about the film and things that happened afterwards, reshooting, etc.  Especially knowing that a lot of those outdoor scenes, despite looking as if it was during the fall, in reality, it was freezing and the talent were freezing as well.  The sense of humor of everyone was just surprisingly fun!  And this is one commentary you won't be disappointed in.
# Director and Writers Commentary - This commentary featured Peter Sollett with novel writers Rachel Cohn, David Levithan and producer Kerry Kohansky.  This was an interesting commentary because both Peter Sollett and Kerry Kohansky would ask the writers about things they were curious about the book and vice versa in terms of its translation from the book on the screen.  Another fun commentary track.
# Deleted & Alternate Scenes - There were a good number of scenes that were cut in the film for pacing.  But all of them are presented on film.  One example that is discussed heavily on the commentary track is the janitor who discovers Caroline near the toilet (in the infamous scene).  This would have been a cool scene to have in the film but nevertheless, glad they included it in this portion of the special features.
# Outtakes - Quite a bit of bloopers during the filming.  Always entertaining to watch!
# A Nick & Norah Puppet Show by Kat Dennings - This featured drawn, colored paper puppets of each character and Kat Dennings just having fun with them and improvising her own storyline with the characters using parts of the story from the film but then adding a killer bear into the mix.  Imaginative mind but yet a fun featurette.
# Ari Graynor's Video Diary: A Look Behind-the-Scenes - This was pretty fun to watch.  Pretty much Ari Graynor with her video camera filming everyone on the set and everyone having fun.  A good showcase of the chemistry among the cast.  They all gel'd.
# Storyboard Animations with optional commentary - This is a segment which filmmakers will enjoy.  The film was shot back in Fall/Winter 2007 but because there were so many questions during screening, the crew reshot certain scenes to answer those questions and thus the storyboard animations proved to be quite helpful to Peter Sollett.  A very informative segment with optional commentary.
# Faux Interview with Michael Cera and Kat Dennings by Eddie Kaye Thomas - This segment was quite interesting.  Actor Eddie Kaye Thomas pretends to be interviewing Michael Cera and Kat Dennings.  His character only has a few minutes to ask questions so he tries to get them to talk but cuts them off when he doesn't like the actor and seems to put most of his attention towards Cera.
# Peter Sollett's Photo Album - Cool photography by Peter Sollett of the cast and during the filming.
# Music Video: ""Middle Management"" by Bishop Allen

And you get a digital copy of the film on the second disc.

There is a certain cool and adventurous atmosphere about ""Nick & Norah's INFINITE PLAYLIST"" that I really enjoyed.  The film is more or less about finding something.  Finding Caroline who is missing.  Finding where Fluffy will be having its live performance.  Finding oneself and finding the person that may be right for you.

The characters are not overly Hollywood, they are not perfect, they are young adults with flaws and even when listening to the commentary, you start to realize that some of the characters are very much akin to the talents behind those roles.  Michael Cera has become one of those rising stars that defines a new generation of youth where in the 80's and even the 90's, many characters in romantic comedy focusing on youths were defined by characters such as the cool preppy, the nerd, the jock, the stoner, etc.  But this film, Cera as Nick is just a normal guy.  He's just a guy who plays bass guitar in a band (does not fit the image of a rock star), his delivery of Nick's lines are just delivered perfectly and believable, that I don't really see many young actors who would have been so convincing portraying the role of Nick.  A wonderful job and you can see why he's becoming such a popular actor of late.

Kat Dennings as Norah is the same.  She was fantastic in this role and really suited her perfectly.  And watching both Cera and Dennings together, they obviously do have good chemistry onscreen.  Typical young adults with their own personal flaws and insecurities that anyone can relate to.  The supporting characters in the film also lend to the believability of the film. Everything just works.

And you also have to give credit to director Peter Sollett and his crew.  The film was his maor directorial debut since his success with the Indie film ""Raising Victor Vargas"".

From originally completing the film in the Fall/Winter 2007, then a test screening it, receiving the feedback, reshooting the newer scenes in the Spring of 2008, Sollet and his crew had to make sure that they sync everything from the newer footage and the older footage of the movie and coming up with the final cut.  That whole opening scene before the band starts performing is all the newer footage that would help establish both the characters of Nick & Norah which definitely made a difference.  Without that whole opening segment, the film could have really sucked.  So, what could have been disastrous was averted.  So, they crew did a great job!

""Nick & Norah's INFINITE PLAYLIST"" is a pretty fun and enjoyable film.  For a romantic comedy featuring youth love, from the various cool locations of New York featured in the film, the adventurous but yet enjoyable romantic storyline, the musical playlist of the whole film, having the main character driving a Yugo, everyone having late night or early morning munchies for hot dogs, a piece of gum that is shared from who knows where it came from, various musical gigs and of course, the mix CD's...  You never realize how much is incorporated into the film.  Again, everything works.

I really enjoyed this film and enjoyed it even more on Blu-ray because the disc was fully loaded with special features and also showcasing really good picture and audio quality.  For the release of ""Nick & Norah's INFINITE PLAYLIST"", they really went all out to give the fans of the film a lot.  And really happy with the final Blu-ray release.

It's a no brainer, if you enjoyed this film, then you're going to have a great time with this Blu-ray edition and probably, like myself, have an even greater appreciation when you learn how much was put into making it.  Highly recommended!",1233273600,3,8858,4.743790849673203
3698185,5,B001MM3AZM,"Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist is a fun coming-of-age story in which Nick (Michael Cera), in the process of getting over his devotion to an awful ex-girlfriend, meets Nora (Kat Dennings).  The pair embark on an adventure throughout New York City (which is forced upon them by Nick's bandmates.)  They bond through their common musical taste and the search for the ultra-secret venue at which their favorite band is staging a surprise concert.

Nick and Nora are surrounding by a lovable cast of friends and the movie is filled with hilarious situational moments that teens and adults alike can relate to and appreciate (remember when...?).  The sountrack only adds to the excitement throughout the movie.",1231459200,5,707,5.121739130434783

3698198,5,B001MM3AZM,"the plot

Nick is barely hanging onto his doomed relationship with Tris, his ""girlfriend"" that he has been with for the past six months.  Tris is the private school, beautiful-yet stuck-up nasty type of girl, who for the whole six months has been cheating on poor Nick.  Still, Nick sends her mixed CDs in an attempt to win her back with his creative form of self-expression.  His heart goes into each of the 11 mixes he sent her, but she never even listens to them, instead she tosses them in the trash after making fun of him behind his back.  That's when Norah comes in, she attends the same private school as Tris, and she usually grabs these mixed CDs from this unknown Nick after Tris discards them.  Norah gets Nick, and seems to understand what Nick is about just from these CDs.

Nick is a bass player in a band called The Jerk-offs.  Tonight he has a gig with his band in the city even though they still lack a drummer.  He doesn't want to go, but when he finds out that his favorite band Where's Fluffy is playing somewhere to be announced in the city tonight, he agrees to play the gig in hopes to see them.  The Jerk-offs are a militant gay band (except for Nick) with songs that include I Wanna Screw That Man.  Tris shows up to the gig with her new boyfriend, and Norah is also there with her friend Caroline.  When Tris kind of ribs Norah that she is at a club alone without a man, Norah lies and says that she is here with the bass player from The Jerk-offs, and she walks up to him and kisses him.

This kiss sets off Tris who now shows a jealous side and wants to win back Nick's adulation by the end of the night.  Meanwhile the two gay members of The Jerk-offs try and nurture this potential relationship between Nick and Norah, and so their night's agenda besides finding out where Where's Fluffy is playing tonight is to make sure that Nick and Norah end up together.  Nick is still confused about his feelings for Tris, and Norah is interested in Nick, but not in being second choice to Tris.  Caroline is the drunken friend who gets plastered way too early and needs to get home, but even this is a challenge as she disappears very early in the night.  What we have is just another magical night of adventure and love that could only be created in New York City.

the breakdown

What is there about the very affable Michael Cera that's not to love?  He's the ultimate underdog in just about every role he's been in, a shy, introverted youth whose real qualities are hidden just below the surface.  What is the main quality you find out about the characters he plays?  That he's just as horny as every other kid his age.  The Nick' character is slightly different from that same mold he casts in every film.  Although his character is just as withdrawn, here he hides a quiet, musical poet that seems to stir up the waters of Norah (Kat Dennings), a girl who searches for this quality in her men.  Norah is the complete opposite of Tris, Nick's current girlfriend.  Tris seems to search for males with the quality in them, which would fill her need to be appreciated, while Norah searches for the boys who will fill her need for inspiration.  In short, Tris needs to feed her ego, and Norah needs to feed her soul.  Nick seems to fill this role effortlessly, but it's not without the stumbling block, which is Tris.

The intimacy that Nick and Norah share is kind of magical.  For instance, the scene when Nick and Norah are in the  Electric Lady Studios, and she tells him about a small yet very personal conviction she has about Judiasm, and when Nick not only compliments what she says but then adds to it, she needs to be closer to him, even touching him.  When he made this intimate part of her even better, she had a need to show him how she feels by physically being intimate with Nick.  It's poetic, almost a tangible entity.  This of course is my own interpretation, but what I'm trying to get across is that at the heart of this film, there's a powerful love story that incidentally feeds my soul.

Living in New York, it was easy to identify with this film.  The fact that the city is relatively small, yet so much to do, and so much could be done without driving all night and wasting half the night to get to all of these destinations in one night is plausible.  Of course, no one here had trouble parking their car or van in front of any place they needed to go, including Penn Station is something you have to overlook.  NYC looks so inviting here, and is truly portrayed as the ""city that never sleeps"".

The worst thing to do is check out all of the extras on the blu-ray.  It very nearly diminished some of the enchantment of the finished film watching the scenes that were cut from the movie.  Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is one of my favorite films of all time, but if even two of these dopey cut scenes were left in, it would have easily been an annoying crapfest.  Nick and Norah would have ended up feeling more like a gay indie film instead of this more relatively easily digestible finished version.  One blu-ray extra I enjoyed is Kat Dennings puppet show version of the movie, very funny.

I'm not sure if I got this point across to you, but I loved this movie.  The casting was spot on, the cinematography is realistic and flattering, the amazing soundtrack compliments each and every scene, and the story is filled with magical dialogue.  In fact, Nick and Norah may have the best last lines in a movie that I could remember right now.  I recommend that you buy this movie on Blu-Ray or DVD right away, but maybe stay away from most of the extras.

3698202,1,B001MM3AZM,"A ""nice guy"" obsessed with his vapid ex-girlfriend meets a ""smart girl"" in a relationship with a guy who's obviously using her to advance his music career. And through the course of a single, incredibly mundane new york night, this superficial nice guy and this naive smart girl fall into some sort of relationship, maybe (it takes place shortly before they head off to college, so who knows)?

Over the course of a single night, the two leads, a drunk friend, and three stereotypically wise gay-best-friends look for a band's secret show, then look for their lost friend, then dinner, then maybe the show again, and when they find it, they walk out because their exes are there. So, yeah.

Nick and Norah bond by constantly insulting each other's insecurities and making music-related small talk, with witty banter like ""why are they called the cure? what are they the curing? they should be called the cause!""

I guess it's supposed to pass for romance, but it makes all the characters feel two-demnsional. And even with the flatness of Nick and Norah, somehow, even with that level of superficiality, the supporting characters feel like props in comparison.

Norah's drunk friend seems like she was pulled directly from a 90s anti-drug PSA. Somehow, she gets so drunk over the course of a single band's set (and remains drunk) that hours later, she vomits into a public toilet (without losing her gum) then drops her phone into the toilet, then her gum, then decides to fish both out. The phone works fantastically, and she decides to keep chewing the gum.

And despite the other three supporting characters being gay (a fact that the film constantly reminds you of), the inclusion of a christmas themed drag show that takes place in the spring (as one of the characters explains ""when has a queen needed an excuse to sing?""), a walk-by from a lesbian couple as part of a gag about Nick being uncomfortable holding his gay friend's hand, and countless other references to homosexuality, the movie never shows a homosexual couple do anything more than hold hands.

All of this reduces their characters to a plot device-- there's the gay guy who can help Norah dress better, the one who gives Nick relationship advice, the one who steps in to beat up a jerk then starts crying. But it all feels really gross, as if they're only there to undermine the possibility of Norah being attracted to any of Nick's bandmates. And the drunk friend feels written to be a ridiculous personification of the dangers of drinking (and something to add 20 more minutes to the film).

If you wanted a version of Before Sunrise that's full of cliched small talk and an ensemble cast of stereotypes or an updated Adventures in Babysitting that eliminates any sense of adventure, this is definitely the film for you. But if you want a movie with characters that consist of more than a list of band names, don't waste your time with this.",1487808000,,2916,4.75098814229249

3698294,5,B001MM3AZM,Sure it's not romantic like titanic or hell even Romeo and Juliet but it's really nice.

In comes her somewhat friend as she discovers it and loves the music (Norah). Eventually Nick performs with his band in a club and Norah and Nicks ex girlfriend are there. Eventually Nick and Norah meet and it's an instant (awkward) connection. Don't want to spoil it but it's worth the watch!,1428969600,,554,4.663265306122449

3698336,4,B001MM3AZM,"I had no idea what this movie would be about but I did enjoy it, for the most part. I am in my late fifties but I could relate to the journey of a young person in modern times living in a busy city and trying to find love and excitement. I thought the movie authentically captured the difficulties of modern young love (in a more realistic world) and gave a viewer an opportunity to peek in on a world that I for one would never enter, especially at this age. The two main characters/actors also portrayed the insecurity of youth and the reluctance to take a chance on love very well. Although my adolescence was over forty years ago, the young characters/actors reminded me that going through that stage has many timeless challenges and it is not an easy one by any means.

While some of the language and scenes were somewhat crude, the overall movie seemed to authentically portray the sometimes crazy and difficult choices one makes when young. For example, although the scene at the bus station bathroom was pretty revolting and completely uncomfortable, unfortunately it demonstrated how low one can get in life when trying to navigate adolescence. (The further theme of reintroducing the gum was quite unnecessary and very uncomfortable for the viewer.) But, overall, this was a nice story of young love wrapped up in some unusual and sometimes uncomfortable packaging. I did enjoy most of it.",1404086400,,1399,4.757201646090535

It's a very emotion-driven film, depicting the independence of these kids wanting to see their favourite band and getting all caught up and tangled in this burrito of a rom-com drama.

Guy gets dumped by girl so he makes these mixes on CD's to give to her. Girl's friend gets them and loves them. One night by chance dumped guy meets ex-girlfriend's friend that loves his ""playlists"" and they ride around NYC all night looking for another friend of his ex's that got drunk is wondering around on her own.

Comments:
Total waste of time. This movie is gross. It is disgusting. I couldn't finish watching it. It was all about losers. It was set in Loserville. If this is how America's youth behaves it is no wonder we are having a national debate on importing low skilled workers to work at McDonald's as well as high skilled ones. Who gets so drunk that they just wonder from place to place vomiting? Putting themselves at risk of being sexually assaulted or killed, and thinks that is ""fun""? Who wants to watch people behaving this way? And the friend ""looking out"" for the drunk just trips over herself in pursuit with this vapid dumb look on her face like she is stoned out of her mind while touching her hair constantly.

Then there are the 3 gay characters who run around with the boyfriend. Openly gay. Talking in vulgar terms about what the band's name should be. And the straight guy . . . talk about liberal propaganda . . . says ""I perfer not to use labels"" when asked if he is straight since he is running around with these gay guys. Totally unrealistic. Total Hollywood pot thought.

Lastly you have the loser boyfriend who ""takes a mental health day"" as he is sick because his gf broke up with him. He creates these CDs of playlists/mixes for her and ends them with him sobbing and crying for her to come back. What a loser. All the while she cheats on him and buses him.

Anyway I wouldn't want ot know these people let alone watch them. And I can't even say the ""scenery was good"" for this movie--who wants to look into a toilet bowel of vomit that came out of a loser alcoholic--an actual scene.

3698357,3,B001MM3AZM,"This film has its moments, but overall feels to me like yet another blissfully hipsterish take on teens who find a connection through music. I don't think that N&NIP really adds much to what we've already seen many times before, and honestly its really not that remarkable as a film in its own right.

The biggest strength here is the sheer likability and genuinely sweet charm of the two leads, played by Michael Cera and Kat Dennings. Their scenes alone together are really nice, with good dialog, and again just really sweet.

The cinematography and music are pretty well done, but beyond Cera and Dennings, there just isn't much going for this film, either in plot or in the other characters. We have the cliched, evil ex-girlfriend, the comedically sleazy gay band mates, and the one-dimensional drunken ditz blonde friend. That blonde's story arc is really off-puttingly disgusting in fact, almost enough for me to bail on the film. Yeah. That bad.

I find this type of film (teens+music)  in general to be kind of unbelievably fantastic relative to my own adolescence, but part of that is just me, and I enjoy a little what-if escapism. N&NIP isn't really all that great; it has some disgusting attempts at humor (out of place in this film) and doesn't really go anywhere. But on the other hand, that is kind of the point. It does have a great title, and it the last image in you head is of Nick and Nora together, then it wasn't without some redeeming value.",1368662400,2,1466,4.670542635658915

3698377,2,B001MM3AZM,"This movie swayed from the story-line in the book, not by much, but enough to notice. They left out many major scenes that reveal character growth. I'm not really fond of any of the actors in this movie, I am tired of seeing Michael Cera only play one character, who does he think he is, Kristen Stewart? and Kat Dennings voice just does not fit with Nora, her voice is deep and masculine and lacks the emotional trauma that her character is supposed to be feeling. The actress who plays Tris, Alexis Dziena, looks like she is still 14 (and still in that LifeTime movie) which gives Nick appearance of being a Pedo and the actor who played Tal just didn't seem to meet the ""stereotypical Jew"" image portrayed in the book. The poor casting didn't help my opinion of this movie. I guess the music in the movie is good (although I thought it was a bunch of noise), mostly obscure bands that no one outside New York City has heard of. I really only bought it for a friend who is obsessed with the book, but to be honest, the book is lame. I find it hard to believe that a story this simple actually took two people to write, its not a unique story but I guess if you just need to waste away for a couple hours it is perfect for you. If you like watching the same ""awkward-romance on a roller coaster"" movie that has to take place in New York City, then this is definitely the movie for you.",1336089600,2,1386,4.233962264150944

Without giving to much away, the casting was perfect bar maybe the ex-girlfriend of Michael Cera who comes across as way too vacuous and not remotely the alt girl type. Anyway, the chemistry between Nick and Norah seems pretty spot on as does the chemistry between the guys in the band and how they interact with each other. The ability to cast gay characters without making them flaming stereotypes was a good move.

There are other nice touches--the Yugo Nick drives, the clubs they hit in NYC, the goofy late night corner store owner and the empty Port Authority bus terminal all just work to create the feeling of ""oh, yeah, I remember being 20 and doing that and being there at 4 a.m."" without all this urban angst and fear that movies seem to want to portray New York as having.

On the extras I enjoyed Norah's puppet show version of the movie. Other than that the outtakes, video diary, etc., are just filler.

In the end, Kat Dennings is a star period who knows how not to overact and Michael Cera finally plays a role more suited to his emo-ness.

I've always quite liked actor Michael Cera in the TV series Arrested Development and in other movies such as Superbad, so I thought I'd give it a go.  I had never heard of the other actors in the film but they all play their parts really well as does Cera who granted does play a very similar nice and a bit nerdy guy character to his one in Superbad and other movies. This is a nice simple story, based on the same titled young adult novel by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rachel-Cohn/dp/0375835334/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rachel Cohn</a>. We have a depressed Nick (Cera) not quite facing reality that his ex girlfriend Triss (Alexis Dziena), has dumped him, isn't a very nice person and isn't interested in the latest mixed burnt CD he has made for her.  His best friends who he also plays in a band with are as loyal as any friends can ever be and want him to come play a gig with them to get over Triss. Oh did I mention the band has no drummer.  Anyway by pure coincidence Nick's favourite band Where's Fluffy, an underground band that only ever plays spontaneous secret gigs is rumoured to be making an appearance in a club somewhere in New York. So with the enticement of tracking down and seeing the elusive Where's Fluffy, Nick decides to play the gig.

Unbeknownst to Nick, Norah (Kat Dennings), a fellow student in his ex's school and victim of her bullying, has been saving those burnt CDs Triss has been ridiculing and throwing in the bin.  She is also a fan of Where's Fluffy and hopes to track down them down with her friend Caroline (Ari Graynor), who's putting it nicely a bit of a drunk.  What follows is a film with a lot of funny moments, and demonstrations of absolute loyalty and friendship amongst Norah and Caroline as well as Nick and his band/friends.  Where Nick and Norah's relationship ends up is a bit predictable yes, but the fun is in getting there! The drunk Caroline provides quite a few laughs as well, and incidentally if you don't think the gum thing would happen in real life then you're probably not old enough to be in nightclubs and such where you often see drunks do a lot worse and stupid things than that.  A great character who doesn't have any lines but provides a lot of funny moments and is also the often mistaken for a taxi by drunks, is the yellow Yugo which is Nick's car.

Peter Sollett (""Raising Victor Vargas"") directs this unexpected, super-sweet teen comedy based on the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan.  It disappointingly flew under the radar when released last year, but a deserved cult following is steadily growing for NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST.

Nick (Michael Cera from ""Superbad"" and ""Juno"") has just broken up with his cheating girlfriend, Tris (Alexis Dziena).  Norah (Kat Dennings), one of Tris's schoolmates, has never met Nick, but already considers him a ""musical soul-mate"" based on Nick's outstanding mix CDs that she manages to salvage after Tris tosses them.  When legendary indie band Where's Fluffy? announces it will be playing a mystery location somewhere in New York, Nick and Norah set out with their respective groups for a wild night...

There isn't much more to the slight storyline, but this merely adds to the charm.  Playing like a Gen. Y cross between ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""After Hours"", NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST is the most refreshing teen comedy I've seen in a long, long, looooong time!  Michael Cera and Kat Dennings are adorable in the lead roles, Ari Graynor is hilarious as Norah's drunken best friend Caroline; and Aaron Yoo and Rafi Gavron are solid in their support as Nick's colourful bandmates.

The Blu-ray comes stacked with bonus features, including Cinechat (an online BD-Live facility which allows you to ""chat"" with friends and compile your own favourite songs from the soundtrack as the movie plays), a ""Nick & Norah Puppet Show"" performed by Kat Dennings, deleted scenes/outtakes and on-set video diaries.

Their nocturnal misadventures are driven by Nora's search for her hard-partying best friend Caroline, who escaped in a fit of paranoia out of a van, while gay-band bassist Nick is nursing a broken heart over Tris, the shallow, man-baiting ex-girlfriend who continues to play him.

If the movie simply limited itself to the odyssey, it would have been satisfying enough for its intended audience, but what director Peter Sollett and screenwriter Lorene Scarfaria have done to transcend the genre is make the lead characters' mutual passion for music the focal emotional point of their growing attraction for one another. Nick keeps sending Tris idiosyncratic mix CDs (like ""Road to Closure, Vol. 12""), which she tosses into the trash only to provide Nora an opportunity to retrieve them and listen to reflections of his broken heart. Neither is able to articulate their feelings otherwise, as shown by their comically bumbling conversations, so the music plays a vital part of their burgeoning relationship. I still don't find Cera terribly versatile, but he has been resourceful in using his now-familiar screen persona of a dweebish sad-sack in suitably well-turned material.

The alt-rock music is appropriately underground to fit the story. There really isn't that much more to the movie since the fate of these characters is clear from the outset.

It's simply that the film has good energy fueled by the constant barrage of music and smart dialogue to fill the love story that emerges from their long night's journey into morning.

3698407,4,B001MM3AZM,"I really enjoyed this movie and was really very surprised.  Lately I've been so disappointed by movies that look like great love stories or romance/comedies that turn out to be vulgar, pathetic, no plot, can barely watch the whole movie disappointments (Knocked Up,Good Luck Chuck etc) that I wasn't expecting much at all - figured I would never last through the whole movie so I waited for cable to air it.  It's a cute, romantic, comedy/love story with good acting, an actual story line and some great humorous moments.  Although one girl was drunk and puking the whole time, teenagers roaming around NYC all night, all of the guys in the band (except the main character) were gay, the writers/directors/producers kept all of it on point with the story and kept the main characters loveable and people you could identify with.

 They could have made it over the top vulgar with too much of the unnecessary ""shock"" factor stuff that seems to take over so many movies these days. There were plenty of places in the film where others would have put in all kinds of scenes that make you not want any teen to watch the movie and wouldn't want to watch it yourself as an adult either but they didn't - they stuck to the story with enough to make it seem realistic for today's teenagers but not so much to overtake the plot.  There were a few scenes I could have done without, that weren't necessary for the story, that were probably put in just to b be able to have someone say something or do something ""cool"" (""Cool"" seems to be all the things that would have made teens blush with embarassment just a decade ago and would never have been in a teen film) but it was only a few and can easily be overlooked because it didn't happen often enough to ruin the movie, and was probably realistic for today.

Thank you for a decent romance/comedy without all the unnecessary trash.",1250553600,,1872,4.537091988130563
3698408,2,B001MM3AZM,"Let me state right upfront that I'm not the target audience for this movie. I'm middle aged with kids a little older than the ones in this movie. Having said that, I've enjoyed many movies about teens and their issues including ""Juno"" which starred Michael Cera who also appears here.
Cera gives a more or less identical performance. He doesn't seem so much to act as to project a specific persona, laid back to the point of being almost catatonic. It was refreshing the first time out but it quickly gets tired. If he's really an actor, I'd like to see him act.
Kat Dennings, the other lead, is better. She projects her character's intelligence, although it's obviously considered socially unacceptable to be intelligent in the milieau in which she moves.
The pairing of ""Nick and Norah"" clearly refers back to the famous ""Thin Man"" series of the 1930s which exuded wit and sophistication along with copious consumption of alcohol. We get the drinking in this version but little of the wit and sophistication.
I supposed it's obligatory for this genre of movie to include a ""gross-out"" moment and this one provides such a moment in spades. I doubt even a girl as drunk as the one in this scene would reach into a toilet full of her own vomit to retrieve a piece of gum and them stick it back in her mouth. Some may find this hilarious. Sorry, not me.
There is a running joke with a Yugo car which might have been funny in 1989.
The two main characters are obviously ""made for one another"" and spend the movie figuring this out after Norah asks Nick to be her boyfriend for five minutes to avoid humiliation at the hands of a catty rival. Their relationship is the one sweet thing in the story, when the movie gives them some time and space to express it -- which is rarely.
The secondary characters are without exception caricatures, including the members of the ""gay"" rock group.
I was hoping for an updated ""American Graffiti"" but I didn't find it here.",1249430400,2,1956,4.5754985754985755
3698409,3,B001MM3AZM,"The Bottom Line:

There are some sweet moments in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist and the casting of two likable leads certainly goes a long way towards making the film a success, but there are also some inexplicably bad moments (the vomit and the gum--why?) and a feeling that more could have been made of the film; I left the theater reasonably pleased but it didn't hold up well in retrospect so exercise caution before plunking down any cash for this one.

3698410,4,B001MM3AZM,"""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"" is a fun, sweet, and predictable movie that has just enough heart to separate itself from all the recent teen dreck (the innumerable ""American Pie"" sequels, ""Van Wilder,"" etc.).  While it is far from a great teen movie, it's well worth a slot in the family film library.

Nick is played by Michael Cera (""Arrested Development,"" ""Juno""), a good actor who has been accused of playing the same character in every movie and TV show:  a smart, sweet, socially-befuddled romantic with a heart of gold and a slightly stammering delivery.  Yes, Cera has yet to show much range, but it's hard to say anyone is better at what he does than he is.  Nick has recently been dumped by his hottie girlfriend, Tris (Alexis Dziena) and has been reduced to making her mix CDs in an attempt to win her back.

Tris gives these pathetic missives a dismissive snort, but they catch the ear of Norah (Kat Dennings).  Norah hangs with Tris because . . . well, it's not entirely clear, as the two girls hate each other.  But she's impressed with this lovelorn, mysterious Nick who creates such amazing mix CDs.  As we will learn over the course of the movie, it pays to pay attention to the music Norah likes (and it pays well).

Nick's gay friends try to snap him out of the dumps by telling him the famous underground band Where's Fluffy? is playing somewhere in NYC that evening.  WF is one of those bands that drops hints as to where they will be playing, and half the fun is finding out where they'll be - you're the coolest kid in school if you can track them down and see a show.  Norah, as a music devotee, is also on the prowl.

The movie tracks these two teens over the course of the evening as they work through standard teen crises, try to track a drunk girlfriend lost in the city, and realize that they are perfect for each other.  This well-worn plot demands that the stars be on their game, and both Cera and Dennings give solid performances.

The movie also features a good soundtrack - perhaps not at the level of ""Grosse Point Blank"" or ""Swingers,"" but still worth a listen.

A relatively tame film for teens these days - no gratuitous T&A and the screenplay aims for true humor rather that Stiffler-esque raunch.  All in all, a good movie.",1247875200,2,2270,4.484184914841849

3698415,5,B001MM3AZM,"NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST is a treat for film lovers of all ages.  It has gotten mixed reviews from the critics and I really don't understand it.  I loved this film.  It is a warm, tender, very funny and endearing story of one night in the life of a group of teenagers.  Led by Michael Cera and Kat Dennings this superb cast does the awesome task of making these teen characters believable, pertinent to the current times  and relatable to people of all ages.  I am a 46 year old man and related as if I was one of them.

The basic beginning plot has Michael Cera still pining over his old girlfriend who dumped him.  He keeps making her burned cds which she tosses and come into the hands of Norah aka Kat Dennings.  Thus Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.  Nick is in a band with his best friends and all the guys are again believable and quite funny.  Norah's best friend is the greatest comedy lift.  The film is a teen film in the age of SUPERBAD and other such films.  It even has Michael Cera who is in SUPERBAD as well as JUNO.  Here his witty style of acting is intact but his character is also very different from his other films.  He seems to reach a deeper level of vulnerability.  Bottom line, this one night journey is one you will be very happy you took.  This film is a love story, a friendship story and a general feel good film for the ages.  You will care about these people and want to revisit them again.  This film is a definite one to own.

And the blu ray version takes full advantage of all blu ray has to offer.  I had just seen it in HD on cable and then purchased it in bluy ray.  I watched it soon after and the oomph both the video and audio got from the transfer was exsquisite.  The 1080p video transfer is crisp, colors are vibrant and the night scenes are striking.  The true hd 5.1 audio provides the best accompanying soundtrack.  Dialogue is strong and music is well utilized.  The full presentation of this film in blu ray is of the highest standard.

3698417,5,B001MM3AZM,"Directed by Peter Sollet, here stars Michael Cera (Superbad, Juno, Arrested Development) and Kat Dennings (40 Year Old Virgin,The House Bunny) in this cute romantic comedy.

Based on my favorite book by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan...Nick (Cera) is the bassist  an all gay band and is depressed over his ex lover Tris(Alexis Dziena) leaving him, so he occasionally makes her mix CD's. Meanwhile, Norah (Dennings) coincidentally gets ahold of Nick's mix tapes when Tris throws them out and falls in love with the music. This draws in these two mysterious teens to each other and they coincidentally meet at the Nick's gig where Norah ask Nick to be her boyfriend for five minutes to save herself from Tris's bitchy mouth. Norah and Nick then agree to spend he night with each other looking for their favorite band called Where's Fluffy and they end up finding each other...

Ok, I'm 15 years old, so you can say I fit the film's demography, but even if I was an old man I still would have enjoyed it...

First of all, I loved the performances. Michael Cera rocks tight skinny jeans, which makes him look pretty metrosexual and cool, and a tight green hoody. Both the pants and hoodie are from American Apparel, so I guess he really wanted to fit the whole hipster-rock fashion style in this movie. Also, just like in the book, he wears the jacket (it's basically a charcoal Dickies Unlined Eisenhower jacket) with the words ""Salvatore"" stenciled on it. Sure Cera does the same role in this one, but it suits his character. Anyway, Cera's character here is more funny and confident such as not being nervous during an erotic scene unlike Evan and wearing tight clothing. However, his character can be a bit too stone-like and boring sometimes such as when his friends tried to get him to do the ""sandwich"" (basically dancing and rubbing their body on each other at the same time) with Norah, but he tries to move away. With a girl that sexy, I would do a double cheeseburger on her. Moving on... Dennings is a great actress herself. She is so pretty that you may not believe or follow the whole ""I think I'm unattractive"" gag. However, she makes you feel and understand her character. Norah does have her times of being annoying and unlike-able such as when she punched Nick hard in the neck when he called her ""jealous"" because even though I'm a boy, if a girl did that to me...I'd maybe have to do that back to her to let her know it feels. In Contrast, Dennings' chemistry with Cera is amazing. They have many great scenes together such as in ""Electric Lady Studios"" when Norah makes a reference to the ""Tikkun Olam"" causing Nick to say ""maybe we're the pieces"" which was so sweet.

Dziena does good in her part as playing a pretty but cold hearted snake, but I felt they could have made her character more understanding, like in the book,  where it shows her having a caring side. Norah's friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) has many funny scenes as a drunk teen out of her mind, but some scenes with her are annoying and makes you want the scenes to go back to Nick and Norah. Disturbia's Aaron Yoo and rising stars Rafi Gavron and Jonathan B wright star as Nick's gay, funny, and helpful friends. Usual geeky Jay Baruchel (Knocked Up) plays Tal, Norah's ex or not boyfriend, who is the best rival for Cera. I love the cameos of Devendra Banhart, Andy Samberg, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and many others.

Other than the performances, the soundtrack is awesome and I am going to add it on my Ipod. The scenarios are beautiful and fits the movie. The movie has many funny moments like Nick's facial reaction to Tris putting her feet on his face while he's driving and funny gags like the whole gum being passes around thing.

In Conclusion,  the movie does have some awkward moments though, but its one of the best hipster rom coms ever. It breaks out of the usual teen comedy traditions and does its own thing just like in ""Juno"". This movie may not be better than ""Juno"", but it sure comes close and is more fun.

3698419,3,B001MM3AZM,"The fundamental problem with the movie is that not enough interesting things happen. There are simply too many stretches where the film just goes flat and not a great deal happens. And insufficient time early on is spent making the two main character especially likable.

It isn't that there aren't some nice moments. There are numerous funny and memorable moments.  But there are few standouts.  The person who pretty much steals the film is Ari Graynor as Nora's drunken friend.  Most of the movie's best moments center upon her.  She looked instantly familiar to me but I couldn't quite place her.  Eventually I realized that she played Olvia Dunham's younger sister on FRINGE.  I haven't seen her on much else, but I very much hope to in the future.  She is a very funny woman.  I also enjoyed Alexis Dziena as Nick's ex-girlfriend Tris.  She was pretty loathsome, but also undeniably cute.  Finally, I loved Kat Jennings as Nora.  She is one of those people who the first time you look at them appears to be forgettable.  Then the next time she seems cute.  Then a few more times incredibly beautiful.  While Ari Graynor is the best thing in the movie, Kat Jennings is the most adorable.  The one person who really disappointed was Michael Cera, who I have loved since the first episode of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Perhaps it was how his role was written, but he just seemed to sleepwalk through much of it.  He usually supplies a host of wonderful moments in his roles, but not in this film.

One odd twist about the film is that given that ""playlist"" is in the title and the posters of a lot of great rock acts on bedroom and other walls are on display throughout, you would expect an awesome soundtrack.  Not so.  This is a remarkably average soundtrack.

Finally, there was surprisingly little reference that I could find to the Thin Man, which you would expect given that the title begins ""Nick and Nora's.""  For anyone who needs an explanation, Nick and Nora Charles are one of the most famous married couples in the history of movies.  Yet the film did make any references to that.  Odd.

So, this movie isn't a waste of time and it is as times enjoyable.  But it isn't all that memorable and certainly anything that I would recommend someone seeking out.

With his roles in mainstream hits such as ""Superbad"" and ""Juno,"" Michael Cera catapulted himself to the head of the class as the modern-day geek of choice for teen comedies (he`s sort of to the 2000s what Molly Ringwald was to the 1980s, a figure average adolescents can relate to).  In ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,"" Cera continues in that mode, playing a straight member of an otherwise all-gay rock band who can't get over the fact that his pretty but snooty girlfriend, Tris, has dumped him for another guy.  One wild night, while in the city with his band mates, the lovesick Nick hooks up with Norah Silverberg, a less pretty but far more authentic girl who attends the same Catholic girls' school as Tris and who discovers, much to her delight, that, in Nick, she may have finally found her ""musical soul mate.""

With a screenplay by Lorene Scafaria (derived from the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan) and direction by Peter Sollett, ""Nick and Norah`s Infinite Playlist"" is an amiable but scattered little comedy that never seems to completely find its footing or to come up with any kind of purposeful meaning or direction.  Filled with jokes and comic concepts that either don't lead anywhere or that simply fall flat, the movie fails to do justice to its youthful and exuberant cast that includes, in addition to Cera, Kat Dennings, Alexis Dziena, Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron, Ari Graynor and Jonathan B. Wright.

The movie does an impressive job not overly stereotyping its gay characters (though a little of that sneaks in anyway), and there are fleeting moments of tenderness and charm as Nick and Nora work on cementing their relationship, but the movie's lack of a clear-cut focus proves yet again that ""niceness"" alone isn`t enough to guarantee a quality movie.",1240099200,7,1793,4.8431372549019605

Why not just say she dumped him cause he was a whiny drip, but she can't just let him go. I could have liked the new girl Norah, but after she karate chops him in the larynx very early on, we're supposed to accept this as just a playful tap. If some chick did that to me I'd karate chop her right back in the face, assuming I could still function with a broken trachea. She might as well have kicked him in the nuts. Norah came across as a self absorbed pouty brat. Her instant orgasm scene was so stupid and tacky, they didn't even have time to undress. Why couldn't they have left it up to your imagination. I forced myself to watch it right to the end, hating the Norah character and watching it go nowhere.

The plot centers around one magical night in the lives of 2 teens who barely even met. Both are into the NYC indie rock scene and are on the search for the secret show of the legendary indie band ""Where's Fluffy"". But this is nothing more than a MacGuffin(look it up), as the real focus of the film is to be on the quickly developing relationship between Nick and Norah; after meeting, they go through trials and tribulations and revelations in the span of one night that real couples take years to go through, which I guess would destroy the realism of the film......but really, who cares.

There are complaints and revelations on how this is nothing but a product or cash-in on the growing indie teen film genre, as in a big studio making a movie that's supposed to have the feel of an indie. I can't argue with this, but none of that would be a problem for me if the film is entertaining, which it is.

I guess you can call it a John Hughes film of today, though it's not nearly as endearing as a film like The Breakfast Club or even Ferris Bueller. It's a fun little film, and I think that's all it's meant to be.",1239753600,,1229,4.334782608695652
3698427,3,B001MM3AZM,"I am not quite sure where all these 5-star reviews come from. In my opinion, it was an OK movie that tried very-very hard to be cute, romantic, and ""trendy"" (in a music sense), but failed. It was just good enough for me to finish watching it.

The reasons why didn't like this movie very much are:

1. Very little chemistry between Nick and Norah. While I liked Michael Cera's character (by the way, I can't truly call Cera an actor, so far he's played the same type of a guy - cute, emotional and nerdy), Norah completely disappointed me - whiny and insecure to an annoying extent. I didn't quite believe in their ""love."" Plus the sex scene after 5 hours of knowing each other felt totally unnecessary, in my opinion.

2. The supposed 17-18-year-olds act like they are 25. Hopping bars, drinking, having sex, staying out till 5 am. Where are their parents, I wonder?

3. I could have done very well without Norah's friend story line. This girl annoyed me enormously and wasn't funny at all.

4. Finally, while this movie is supposed to be about the music (at least that's what the title implies anyway), music played a very small part in the movie. It didn't feel organic to the story, just a background noise.

I am not sure why this movie came out the way it did. Maybe something got lost in translation from book onto screen? I can't answer that, simply because I am not interested enough to pick up the book to compare.",1239580800,4,1424,4.457692307692308
3698428,5,B001MM3AZM,"When you think about it, nothing much really happens in this movie. NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST takes place in the course of one day and night, with the crux of the story occuring in the wee hours of the morning. So there's a bit of an energetic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/After-Hours/dp/B000286RNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">After Hours</a>&nbsp;vibe in this movie, but catered towards the sensibilities of hip teenagers who prowl the New York streets way past their bedtime. But then it also has echoes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-in-Babysitting/dp/6305428050/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures in Babysitting</a>, with Ari Graynor's awfully wasted Caroline subbing in for Penelope Ann Miller's nervous Brenda. Going into this one, and me being a huge fan of one of the most fabulous romantic couples in cinema, Nick and Nora Charles (of the Thin Man series), I was already favorably predisposed towards this quirky teenage romantic comedy.

Norah has never met Nick. But she knows about this guy who makes the best break-up mix CDs, most of which were pieced together for his ex-girlfriend Tris (his latest opus being titled ""Road to Closure Vol. 12""). But Tris just pokes fun at the poor sap and then promptly discards these mixes, with Norah then un-discarding them and putting them in her I-pod. Because Norah absolutely digs these mixes. So, no, Norah has never met Nick, but she's probably halfway in love with the guy anyway.

Now Nick may not look like he's all that (in fact, he looks kinda dorky), yet he plays in a rock band, plays the guitar although he doesn't quite know how to work the drum machine. And dude drives a broken-down yellow Yugo which people often mistake for a taxi. But being in a band has to count for a couple of cool points, right? The plot MacGuffin is that the legendary rock band Fluffy is scheduled to put on a secret show somewhere in NYC, the rub being, of course, that the time and location are kept a mystery, leaving Fluffy's fans scouring the city for clues in the form of little white rabbits. Nick and Norah happen to be such fans, and, during this evening, they meet by chance and then are thrown together by circumstances (circumstances being the misplacing of Norah's unholily inebriated BFF and a half-hearted quest to find Fluffy). And, somehow, someway, it turns out that Nick and Norah just may be perfect for each other.

Segue alert. The special features in this dvd are pretty righteous: two cool audio commentaries - one with Director Peter Sollett, Michael Cera, Kat Dennings, and Ari Graynor (fun!); the other with Peter Sollett, authors Rachel Cohn & David Levithan, and screenwriter Lorene Scafaria; 4  minutes of outtakes; 9 deleted/alternate scenes; an awesome ""Nick & Norah Puppet Show"" by Kat Dennings (she pretty much recaps the film but also throws in a savage bear); Ari Graynor's excellent video diary; storyboard animations; a fake interview with Michael Cera & Kat Dennings; Peter Sollett's photo album; and Bishop Allen's music video ""Middle Management."" All worth checking out.

I really like this movie. See this one especially if you like movies in which two people just mostly hang out and come to find that they're awesomely sympatico. Michael Cera (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno (Single-Disc Edition)</a>) and Kat Dennings are terrific together, showing off an easy, natural chemistry. The low-key Michael Cera, with his not-quite-male-model looks, is likeable because he's so relatable to nerds like me, but he's also got his act together, not to mention that Cera has that wonderfully dry delivery. Kat Dennings is amazing in this film, with her vibrancy and spunk and wistful vulnerability and just her girl-next-door realness. How can you not pull for her, especially when you find out that her ex-boyfriend was mostly using her to get in good with her influential music producer dad? And don't discount the supporting actors. It's cool that Nick's gay homies aren't portrayed stereotypically, but more as regular dudes and who really are looking out for Nick. And credit to Ari Graynor for being a good sport in some pretty humiliating haplessly drunk scenes (that scene of Caroline sifting thru a soiled toilet for her bubble gum is funny, but in a really gross kinda way).

Do they ever find the legendary rock band Fluffy? It doesn't really matter, because this movie isn't really about Fluffy. There's no dumbing down here, and there are many moments of great appeal, mostly generated by the two leads. Set in the gritty neon backdrop of the Big Apple at night and with a playlist of cool indie-rock tunes to serenade things along, NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST, funny and romantic, wistful and unconventional, should please both teens and adults, the night owls and even those who like to turn in early - and thus will never know the delights of experiencing a live Fluffy concert. Although, again, it's not about Fluffy.",1239321600,10,5141,5.30958230958231

3698430,3,B001MM3AZM,"Light, fun teen-romance comedy. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that the leads are supposed to be high-school students, but talk and act like they're 10 years older. I mean, how do 17-year-olds go clubhopping in NYC on a regular basis, at least often enough where they know everyone and everyone seems to knows them? Not to mention the loser musician that is dating the jailbait-aged Norah. Despite these questions (and others), if you don't think about it too much, and just sit back and relax, it's an enjoyable movie to watch, and it was the perfect flick to watch on an airplane, as I did.",1238198400,,605,4.559633027522936

3698433,4,B001MM3AZM,"There are any number of reasons why ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"" will be frequently compared to 2007's indie hit ""Juno"", chief among them the presence of Michael Cera, the male lead in that film, again opposite a peppy brunette who isn't quite sure what she wants in life (neither is he, for that matter).  While not in the same league as ""Juno"" in terms of character or story (though possessed of a far less annoying soundtrack), it is worthwhile for anyone looking for an entertaining film about teens.

The titular Nick is the depressed guitarist for a queercore band (meaning, all the other members are gay), and thoroughly depressed over being dumped by his girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dzienza); at the urging of his bandmates, he goes to their latest gig, largely because he has learned that his favourite band (`Where's Fluffy?') will be playing at an undisclosed location (which seems counterproductive to selling, to me, but what do I know about hipster music?).  Norah, meanwhile, is a nominal friend of Tris' who has never met Nick, but knows of him through the CDs he is continually making and sending to Tris (""Road to Closure, volume 12"" the most recent example), which she picks up after Tris discards them.  A chance encounter leads to them meeting cute and pretending to be together, sparking a multiplicity of sideplots involving a jealous Tris, Norah's drunk friend Caroline (Ari Gaynor, who deserves some kind of prize for playing one of the least appealing drunks in recent memory), and, of course, the question of ""Fluffy"".

This is the sort of production that (like ""Before Sunrise"") hinges on the main actors' performances and chemistry, and Michael Cera and Kat Dennings succeed wonderfully in that regard.  Cera, as most reviewers have noted, is basically playing the same character that he played in ""Juno"", ""Arrest Development"", and ""Superbad""; it's a popular persona, one that he has honed to smile-inducing precision, and, in his defence, he is nowhere near the first actor to develop a schtick (indeed, most of the greats refined a persona and either played to or against type).  Cera might try something different in the near future just to give a better idea of his rang (serial killer!), but I won't hold that against him.  Kat Dennings, meanwhile, strikes a very individual note; Norah is extremely well-characterized.  Dennings does a good job of showing her uncertainties and conveying her frustrated attitudes towards the still-hung-up Nick.  The rest of the cast does a good job in small parts.  The crew makes the New York nightlife look tremendously appealing.

Recommended as a light entertainment.",1237852800,,2644,5.025171624713959
3698434,2,B001MM3AZM,"So I actually became interested in reading this book after seeing the previews for the movie but I was never interested in seeing the movie until I read the book. Confusing, I know. I found the book to be much better than the movie. I can appreciate where the movie is trying to go but there was much less substance than the book. I did like how the movie portrayed the character of Norah. She seems just as genuine as her character in the book; however, I feel Nick's character got short-changed in the movie in favor of focusing on the supporting characters who played very minor roles in the book but were giving more screen time than necessary. Overall, if I saw this movie without ever even knowing about the book, I would have found it cute and endearing but having read the book, I was left wanting more.",1237334400,4,811,4.413333333333333

3698438,4,B001MM3AZM,"Okay, so the rise of `Juno' probably paved the way for films like `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist' to get major attention.  That said, `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist' is deserving of that attention whether you're a fan of `Juno' or not.  It has the same charm without the almost over bearing dialog, and the performances are just as cute and spunky (although Page was a wonder far more wonderful than anyone here).  `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist' knows what kind of film it is, and so instead of trying to be something else it just works hard to be the best at what it does.

The film is pretty much about a search mission.  A group of teenagers start out searching for a concert, wind up searching for a lost friend and then realize all along they were searching for new beginnings.

Nick has been dumped by his two-timing girlfriend Tris and so he spends his days creating mix tapes for her to proclaim his love.  Tris is discarding these tapes, only to have her schoolmate Norah scoop them up.  Nora, having never met Nick, is falling in love with him based on his musical taste alone.  Nick belongs to a band where he is the only straight member, and his band is obsessed with another band named `Where's Fluffy'.  The `Fluffy' band has a habit of making their fans go crazy following clues in order to track down their hidden concerts.  So, Nick and his buddies go out in search of
`Fluffy'.  Nora and her friend Caroline do the same.  Next thing you know Nora is kissing Nick, Tris is trying to win Nick back and Caroline is suddenly lost in the city.

Let the search mission begin.

The film is equipped with dialog that feels fresh without feeling overdone.  I love me some `Juno' and in the end I may consider it a better movie (as overbearing as the dialog was, it was hilarious) but it was nice to see a film that didn't try to overdo it.  It was hip, it was young and it was witty without being too much.  The film also sports some really nicely crafted performances by the cast, especially Cera (he is so big right now) and Dennings (watch this girl, she's going places).  They have such a genuine sparkle in their eyes (especially Dennings) that you can't help but adore them.

The film is not perfect.  As my wife pointed out, parts of the film can feel a little stupid, but I think that it all comes together rather nicely in the end.  I actually thought that Nick's closing comments were rather poignant (see my review title) and found the films overall grasp of what true companionship means to be quite profound.  Like I mentioned, this is a film that knows what kind of film it is.  It is a teen romantic comedy (as in, this is not targeted toward the adult crowd) and so instead of trying to please everyone it works very hard to please the teenager in us.

It does that very well.",1236556800,,2814,4.406976744186046

3698443,5,B001MM3AZM,"For those old enough to remember, this week's film is not a recreation of the classic Thin Man series. Instead, it is a refreshing romantic comedy that takes place in New York among a young generation living for the moment and for music. It is about the perfect combination of songs laced together with affection and adoration. It is about finding love in the most unlikely place. It is about NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST.

Nick (Michael Cera) is a struggling musician in just starting band. The film open's with Nick making his umpteenth CD mix of music for the girl of his dreams, Tris (Alexis Dziena) who has dumped him several weeks back. Nick is hopelessly in love and blind to the fact of how he's been treated.

Cut to Norah (Kat Denning), walking the halls of the all girls school she attends where she is friends of a sort with Tris. As Tris receives Nick's mixes she tosses them into the trash where Norah recovers them, entranced by the music Nick has chosen and jealous of the romance that Tris ignores.

Word gets out among this late teen set that Where's Fluffy, a hot band with a penchant for playing gigs without telling anyone until the last minute where they are, will be playing that night. Nick and his band mates have a gig to play following which they plan to go. Norah and her best friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) plan on going as well. What are the chances they will all meet?

Norah and Caroline show to hear Nick's band, not knowing that Nick is the same guy who's been sending mixes to Tris. When Tris shows up as well with a new guy on her arm and taunts Norah, Norah lies she has a boyfriend as well. Who does she choose out of the crowd? Nick of course who is clueless.

Nick, Norah and a now drunk Caroline hop into Nick's Yugo (a humor filled vehicle if there ever was one) to head out. When he can't get the car started, his friends come to the rescue, jumping the car and offering to take care of Caroline because they saw the glimmer of something between Nick and Norah.

As the film progresses, the pair spar back and forth ranging from interest in one another to bickering to eventually realizing there might be something there. As the cruise the streets and musical clubs in search of the location for that nights Where's Fluffy gig, they get closer. At the same time, Nick's friends lose Caroline who wakes to think she's been kidnapped and escapes.

Now the film runs back and forth between the pairing of the leads and the search for Caroline. One scene in particular will have you swearing off chewing gum for years. The predicaments the groups find themselves in as they pair and split range from touching to hilarious.

Along the way, Tris decides that she doesn't like the idea of Norah taking her ex, even though she cheated on him the entire time they were together. It's a territorial thing that makes he do anything to get Nick back if even for one night.

Will Nick see through her plan? Will Nick and Norah realize that there just might be a spark of something between them? Will the entire group ever find Where's Fluffy? Watch and see.

I've not been a big fan of Michael Cera but he does a stand up job here, never going too far over the edge with the nerdish touch to his character and playing the wounded pup to perfection. Kat Denning has become a treat to watch this past year between her roles in CHARLIE BARTLETT, THE HOUSE BUNNY and now this film. She's a smart and believable actress and one to take note of.

The movie offers young people finding love, falling out of love, searching for love and all with a touch of humor to wash it down. It never takes itself too seriously or gets too intense. It is a romantic comedy that delivers. And that's something we could use more of these days.",1236124800,,3754,4.426086956521739

Of course, Michael Cera is comedy perfection and Ari Graynor who plays Kat Dennings' best friend Caroline pretty much helps make this movie! This movie's genius is that it celebrates what it is to be young. But it also highlights those awkward moments that often come with adolescence. Dennings (one of my favorite new young actresses) and Cera have great chemistry, the music kicks butt, and the story is pretty accurate when it comes to the young guy/girl dynamic that seems to have taken control since my generation (as my dad would say: ""I don't know what is with your damn generation. When I was younger, if a guy liked a girl all he had to do was look at her and she knew. There was none of this 'going-out-as-friends' nonsense."" - side note: I love my dad).

I will agree with others who say that `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist' is this generation's `Almost Famous' and if so, it lives to the standards.  But this movie is so much more than a typical romance, comedy, or romantic comedy.  It's a story about love, without all the gimmicks and perfectly synched love connections.  It is exactly what high school love, and yes, even love in general, can often become: a series of smoothing out awkward, rough communication barriers and blunders.  Nick and Nora don't fit perfectly like a puzzle, but they form a bond through shared struggles.  Much like most anyone we meet.  Their romance is as real as Hollywood gets.

Michael Cera and Kat Dennings play their roles wonderfully, and along with a good supporting cast, an intense screenplay, and just the right amount of lighting and editing, this DVD is the best releases of 2009 thus far.  Specifically, I want to put its superb quality and excellence on not only the soundtrack, but also the score, which sets the mood perfectly.

Other reviewers are correct, there is crude humor.  It lies on the higher threshold of a PG-13 movie, and some scenes have intense, stomach-churning puke scenes.  Nora's best friend Caroline is grotesque, but like a dark backdrop, it makes Nora shine all the brighter.

Buy this movie.  At least watch this movie.  If you enjoy the `Juno' and `Superbad' era of teenage angst, you will enjoy `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist'.  Even if you don't, you'll probably find at least some aspects of it highly enjoyable/entertaining.",1235433600,,1609,4.947761194029851

This is a typical teenage romance story, but with some new twists. The male lead (Michael Cera) is the only straight member of his rock band, and after a performance the band decides to search for the top secret Manhattan venue of a concert by their favorite indie group ""Where's Fluffy?""

Along the way he encounters a girl with similar musical tastes (Kat Dennings), her ditsy best friend (Ari Graynor), and her ex-boyfriend (Jay Baruchel).  Naturally, there are also several encounters with his ex-girlfriend (Alexis Dziena), leading to some awkward moments.

I can't help mentioning the nauseating scene, a reminder of which keeps popping up during the movie, but otherwise this is a surprisingly sweet romantic comedy with a good soundtrack.  I wouldn't buy it, but recommend it as a rental.

When his friends are able intervene and convince him to come to a club with them because their band has a gig to play.

When Trissa embarrasses Norah into producing a boyfriend Norah picks Nick out of a crowd and convinces him to pretend he's her boyfriend with a kiss and because Nick realizes Norah knows Trissa and wants to see if Trissa talks about him. The audience is let in on the fact that that Trissa is fine with breaking up, as long as you play by her rules and still want her and don`t really move onto a new girlfriend. When Norah finds a clue as to where the HOT underground band Where's Fluffy is playing they all head out into the New York night where they separate and come together in their adventures and quests in the night. Nick and Norah go off in Nick's taxi cab yellow Yugo, Nick's friends go in search of Caroline, and Caroline wanders the city until she literally finds Jesus. And a piece of gum has its own adventures that none of the chewers of the gum would want to know about.

Nick and Norah really works as a movie because it doesn't betray its innocence or the innocence of it's characters. One character puts it succinctly that The Beatles got it right with the sentiment of I want to hold your hand and the movie sticks to that premise of innocence. It also treats both characters equally. Most of these types of movies are adolescent male fantasies in which women are only the object of desire. While Nick and Norah is a teenage fantasy, it is a shared fantasy of finding someone you really like and who really likes you for the person you are.

The DVD is chock full of bonus features that includes two commentary tracks, deleted and alternate scenes, and my favorite a 5 minute puppet show by Kat Dennigs, who plays Norah, which is a quick parody of the movie and adds a resolution that maybe the movie should have added.",1235088000,2,2306,4.408450704225352
3698449,1,B001MM3AZM,"This movie at first reminded me of JUNO, but JUNO was much better. This seems to be directed at a younger age, so maybe younger people might like it. Even though it says PG-13 and I wasn't very fond of the language.

Okay, so what really bothered me about this movie is the PUKE scenes. I mean, this girl gets drunk and goes to the bathroom to puke. They show it and then she drops her cell phone in the toilet. After she drops her cell phone in the puke infested toilet, OPPS there goes her GUM! Now this next part you won't believe.... she STICKS HER HAND IN THE TOILET TO GET THE GUM and puts it back in her mouth. Also gets her cell phone out of the toilet too. THEN....... this single piece of gum goes traveling between the mouths of all of these characters.

I don't know about you but.... that makes me want to go vomit but NOT stick my hand down in it.

Not only that, but the drunk girl pukes in a ice cream freezer at the store, and they show the puke in the ice cream freezer!

The whole movie....... this drunk girl is puking and burping like she is going to puke. I didn't like that AT ALL. There should have been a warning on the back... ""Contains puke scenes.""

If you have a weak stomach like me, then I say don't watch it!",1234742400,6,1240,4.08641975308642

3698451,4,B001MM3AZM,"(The Film ****1/2)
Trouble ensues when a group of music loving hipster teens have a night out on the town (NYC) desperately seeking their favorite band, Where's Fluffy?. Like many people my age, I had little to no interest in seeing this PG-13 rated, dubbed teen comedy in theaters. So I didn't. I thought, better leave this one to the kids. Boy was I wrong, and I am sorry, okay?

First off, I want to express how much I enjoyed and appreciated the filmmakers (and I suppose the writers of the novel, too) for incorporating  true non-stereotypical homosexual youths corresponding with heterosexual teens without the homophobia of it's lead characters.

""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"" is one of the most fun and enjoyable films I've seen recently. This is a film I can watch over and over again and not be bored or bothered. The entire cast is excellent. I especially liked Ari Graynor who played the hilarious lush, Caroline. She was definitely a highlight of the film-as was her chewing gum. What I think made ""Nick and Norah"" so accessible to me was its idea of love and music. Being an avid music lover, mostly indie, I could easily identify with these characters. They love music just as much as they love wanting someone to share it with. It's a great idea that frankly I haven't seen in a teen comedy or any other romantic comedy-well, maybe once if you count ""Once"" as a romantic comedy.  So I say, put your grievances aside over the PG-13 rating and give Nick and Norah a chance. You might be surprised as to how edgier the once mild rating has gotten. Finally.

Blu-ray features (*** 1/2)
Grain haters beware because there's plenty of it here. About 97% of the film takes place at night so grain is everywhere. However, the picture doesn't suffer because of it. In fact, the picture looks quite authentic and real. It's still a wonderful transfer to the blu-ray format-just don't expect something mind blowing. The audio on the other hand is great. The special features are nice but could have been better. The star-studded commentary is enjoyable. There's an outtake reel, a video diary behind the scenes filmed by, I think, Ari Graynor, deleted scenes, a music video by Bishop Allen (yawn), and a puppet show by Michael Cera and Kat Denninngs?  Enjoy.",1234396800,,2269,4.717171717171717
3698452,5,B001MM3AZM,"This is a great little gem of a movie. There is really a great deal going on in the dramatic developement which takes place over the span of less than 24 hours.  I have seen this film 3 times and each time found more. It has its crude moments and I won't call it a perfect film but it expresses something so true about how people find each other: Not through some grand event or accident but through living their lives, including the parts that do not work well or are impractical. I really liked it.",1234224000,,500,4.208333333333333
3698453,5,B001MM3AZM,"So today i rented that movie Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, and i have to say i REALLY liked it. I suggest you all watch it. I did, twice in a row, I liked it that much. Then I went and bought it!
I like romantic kinda Stuff when It's simplistic and sweet, and also the most important thing: BELIEVABLE! Michael Cera and Kat Dennings have UNBELIEVABLE chemistry! Seriously man, watch it!",1233964800,2,392,4.458333333333333
3698454,4,B001MM3AZM,"""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"" is a cute teen rom-com with some funny moments, although it is a bit self-conscious at times.  Michael Cera plays Nick, a sensitive emo who is the only straight guy in a queercore band.  He was dumped on his b-day by Tris, a mean girl who ignores the romantic mix tapes Nick has continued to send to her.  The mix tapes end up in the trash, where Tris' friend, Norah (Kat Dennings) retrieves them and muses over Nick's excellent music taste.  Nick and Norah finally meet when his band plays a gig in New York City, and they find that they have a lot in common.  When rumors begin to fly that their favorite band (Where's Fluffy) are playing a free late-night show, Nick and Norah set off to figure out where the show will be.  During the night, they get to know each other, separate several times, come face-to-face with their exes, and figure out whether to end the night together.

Fans of recent hip teen comedies, such as ""Juno,"" will probably find much to like about this movie, although there are some forced plot situations that undermine the overall movie.  Fortunately, there are some funny lines, and the tone is good-natured.  Michael Cera plays pretty much the same character he did in ""Juno;"" at times, he's a bit mumbly and flat, but he plays befuddled sensitivity well.  I haven't seen much of Kat Dennings before, but she comes across as likeable and bright here.  Music plays a central role in the budding relationship between Nick and Norah; however, we get only snatches of the music, not an infinite playlist.  The movie is surprisingly sweet and relies more on clever dialogue than on expletives.  Well worth a look.",1233964800,3,1673,4.649659863945578
3698455,3,B001MM3AZM,"I loved the movie in the theaters , but the video quality on this BRD was awful.  We played this on a calibrated 46"" Toshiba Regza 120Hz via Sony PS3 over HDMI.  Almost all of the scenes shot at night were VERY grainy.  Great movie, just don't expect a high-quality transfer.",1233878400,,275,4.352941176470588
8321474,3,B001MM3AZM,"I don't like when a movie ignore the reality of an action in their own movie.  For instance, one teenage female character gets in a taxi and tells the driver to follow another car.  This went on for awhile.  How did she pay for it?  Or the other guy that was with her?  It was just ignored.  And, at least in this particular movie, Michael Cera was really ""all that"" to have two beautiful girls show interest in him.  I just wasn't buying it.  And this movie takes place during one night and it was apparently the longest night ever.  They really got around.  Again, not very believable.  It was half decent hence my 2.5 stars.",1526169600,,627,4.318965517241379
