8756236,5,B01DKXHEH0,"Currently, this show is readily available via many streaming services, which is how I have seen it most often. Which is a good thing since the home video versions are so hard to come by for one reason or another. But I've already written a full review of the show itself on another edition so I won't get into that here. It's not like anyone will buy this edition without having seen the show already, not at this price. While there is a far more reasonably priced region free Asian DVD edition, which I have seen, but it is far from an ideal edition for enthusiasts of the show, or first time viewers. Plus it can be hard to get in the U.S.A.
  Which leads us to the specifics of this particular blu-ray edition. Granted, it is insanely expensive, I had to save up for it myself. Perhaps all the music royalties drive up the price. Or perhaps they were anticipating very small sales in such a culturally bankrupt nation as America. So they had to charge a lot to justify making it all. Regardless the reasons, is it worth it? With the 22 episodes spread over 6 Blu-ray Discs, the picture and sound is quite rich and vibrant. Much better than streaming or that over compressed Asian DVD edition. Which is important in a sensory show such as this. The subtitles are well timed and placed, the best I have seen of all editions I have come across. They distinguish dialogue spoken over each other well, in some cases on opposite sides of the screen. Rather than sloppily lump it all together like they do on the Asian DVD edition. On screen text translations are placed right next to the text in question rather than run it inline with the spoken word subtitles, for greater ease in following along. The Asian DVD edition doesn't always bother with translating text, including some critical points. In all honesty, I haven't experienced too much of the English dubbing. What I have heard seems to diminish the dramatic punch, but I'm sure that isn't much of a surprise. With the audio commentary consisting of the English cast, I find that extra completely unnecessary. The textless opening and closings are subtitled as well. So you can see how well the theme songs fit the show. The included soundtracks are actually score material. Not the classical performances featured in the show. Which is kind of cool, but not what I was hoping for. The collector cards contain some lovely artwork. In short, this is the edition to have, and I am glad to have it. I love this show that much. Or perhaps I should say I'm obsessed with the show that much. Obsessed enough that I gladly paid the price for the best quality edition currently available. The real question is, how obsessed are you?",1491609600,4,2681,4.571725571725572
