8676008,5,B00N3DQ8BG,"This is a super fun and challenging workout.  It's 6 sections that are each 10 minutes long and it includes a warm up and cool down.  3 sections are cardio focused and the remaining 3 are bodyweight toning.  You can sequence the segments as you'd like.  I often do the cardio sections for a great 30+ minute (including w/u & c/d) workout.  When I'm feeling really energetic, I'll do the whole workout.  However, I find the bodyweight sections more challenging b/c I can't go at the pace the participants do in those sections.  However, I can keep up during the cardio portions.  (I consider myself an intermediate-advanced exerciser.)

What makes this workout challenging is that it's mostly nonstop, there's a few (much needed) seconds of rest between each section.  Also, it's got a lot of challenging moves.  What makes this workout fun is the instructor, Patrick Goudeau.  He's high energy and encouraging.  Additionally, he's great at cueing.  The music is upbeat and motivating.

While there are some tuck jumps in one cardio section, I usually just don't jump as high - need to protect my knees.  There are hops, leaps, scissors, etc. during the cardio sections, but you can easily make smaller movements and be ok in terms of impact.  There isn't a modifier, but outside of the few jumps, it's mostly a low impact (although high intense) workout.  I like this workout way more than I expected I would.  I recommend it to anyone.",1440374400,2,1436,4.7877551020408164
8676009,5,B00N3DQ8BG,"Great instructor fun to workout with, you will burn a lot of calories and time flies by and you do not really need any equipment other than your body and a jump rope for one of the segment but you can go without the jump rope because you can pretend you have one and just jump. I have a lot of exercise dvds and I know when I find a good workout and with this one you can customize your own workout so you can workout from 10 minutes up to an hour if you have the time.  Patrick is great,  worth every penny!",1423267200,2,508,3.875
8676010,5,B00N3DQ8BG,"A really tough, fun, creative workout made up of six 10 minute segments. It left me really breathless even though I am quite advanced. You need no equipment apart from an optional 2 minute jump rope segment. Very highly recommended to exercise junkies for those cardio days.",1413417600,2,274,4.851063829787234
