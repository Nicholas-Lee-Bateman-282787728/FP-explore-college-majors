2899200,5,B000TGJ8DA,"I've become addicted to this crazy little series. It's a little corny is some aspects but it's also rather entertaining. I also let my neice and nephew watch this series as it's good clean animation that I don't have to worry about them picking up bad habbits for language from, it's nice not to have to worry about them picking up bad language from the cartoons they watch.",1193270400,,374,4.514705882352941
2899201,2,B000TGJ8DA,"I bought both complete sets of seasons 1 and 2 and couldn't wait for Season 3. But Season 3 seems to have strayed off the subtle, multi-layered epic approach to plot movement and character development that made it appealing to viewers of all ages.

Previously Avatar generally developed the characters without resorting to shallow teen soap-opera style techniques. This season seems to be focused on teen-age angst. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there's a real point, but it's not working for me yet. I keep hoping it will get better.

The Awakening: This was a good start for the most part. Love the silent Iroh.

The Headband: Interesting. Not really sold on the ""have a dance, find your inner rhythm, & we'll all be friends"" idea.

Painted Lady: Really great episode. The series seemed to be back on track.

Sokka's Master: Another great episode. Good job of developing Sokka's character and adding some intrigue (the white lotus piece). Love the peek into Hiro's resolve and ""crazy like a fox"" act. Iroh adds so much depth to this show.

The Beach: I liked Zuko so much more before this episode. This episode made him more shallow and flat. There were flashes of the old class. I was intrigued by the dialog between Mai and Zuko (when he throws the family portrait in the fire). And a few of Ty Li's lines to Zuko helped to bring some depth to her character. But over all the episode fell flat for me. I wish they'd taken more time to subtly add depth/reveal the character of these 4 instead of trying to do it all in one episode. It didn't work for me.",1192924800,24,1562,4.580645161290323

The drama unfolds as we wait with abaited breath what becomes of Aang and his comrades of life.

2899210,2,B000TGJ8DA,"ACK!  Bought this to catch up on a few Season 3 Episodes and after the first one on the DVD they Cut off the entire intro and intro scenes on the rest of the episodes.  There was SIGNIFICANT story info completely lost.  I own the first 2 Seasons and they are great. I WILL NOT BUY another season 3 DVD is they are all like this.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?????  The TV episodes for season 3 are good, but you would think they were awful if you only had this DVD to judge by.  Wait until they are on Reruns on Nick, then record them.  Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1195257600,,567,4.008928571428571
2899211,5,B000TGJ8DA,"After the long 9 month hiatus that nick forced by providing fans with no new avatar news, Avatar makes it long waited Season 3 debut. Though the first five episodes seemed disappointing to fans, there was a purpose. Avatar is a  little kid's show, intended for the 6-10 demographic. In war, there is always a certain amount of propaganda. Propaganda that generates hate towards the enemy. In order to provide moral ethical values into the show, Avatar must show that though there is an ongoing war, not all people participating in the war can be considered ""evil."" The first five episodes shows the fans and viewers of Avatar that Fire Nation citizens are not all bad and evil. Overall, the majority of them are just ordinary people who have the same problems as everyone else. The first 5 episodes of Avatar does the job of uncovering what the fire nation is all about brilliantly as it does so in a comedic and playful way.",1194739200,3,925,4.640243902439025
2899212,4,B000TGJ8DA,"This is not only the best animated show on television, but one of the best shows period. The DVD's are lame, with low-def transfers, no widescreen presention, no surround sound. They are dark, washed out looking, especially on a HDTV, even with 1080p upscaling. I couldn't be more disapointed wiht the presentation or sound. I just watched ""The Clone Wars"" DVD and it reminded me of how brilliant animation can look on a 16:9 HDTV, then I watched an episode off of this dvd and realized how I had wasted $12 on it!

I hope the do a delux, HD version of all three seasons at some point, this one is not worthy.",1194652800,,609,4.389380530973451
2899213,5,B000TGJ8DA,"I love this show above all others. I started watching with my 10 year old and was captured enough to buy season 1 & 2. I struggled with anticipation for season 3 and have been a little disappointed with such a long wait and hum drum set of episodes, but I do understand how difficult the creators have it to keep such a wonderfully developed story going. I am so sorry to hear of the death of Mako the voice of Uncle Iroh. He was truly a gifted actor.

The best seen so far has been episode 5, the Avatar and the Firelord. It put so much into perspective. I truly enjoyed episode 3, Sokka's Master. I hope and pray that the people who are creating the show know how much people really identify with Aang and how much we look forward to the completion of his journey. All the characters are strong and need to stay that way.

Zuko is a wonderful character because of the struggle he finds within himself of wanting to please his father but also wanting to please his uncle. Sokka is great because he provides comic relief and yet guides with inner strength. And Uncle Iroh has great wisdom and gives such good advice with patience in his voice. I hope that we do not have to wait as long for season 4 as we did for season 3 because I do not think this will be the end.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Book-3-Fire-Vol-1/dp/B000TGJ8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar The Last Airbender Book 3 Fire, Vol. 1</a>",1193443200,10,1471,4.7421875

Aang wakes up on a Fire Nation ship with a full head of hair after being knocked out for a few weeks. He finds that his friends, Katara, Sokka, and Toph, and the first and second's father's war troop are just weeks away from invading the Fire Nation. From there on the kids continue on adventures throughout the Fire Nation. Some of the best on this disc include ""The Headband,"" an Avatar dance special, and ""Sokka's Master,"" a Sokka-focused episode that's got plenty of action and good old Sokka humor. Plus, you get some audio commentaries and Part 1 of the ""Private Fire"" comic book story.

8209216,5,B000TGJ8DA,This DVD book is just the same as the others...very good!  I love these stories & I am over 40!(I watch them w/my younger daughter).  A great series of shows to make a collection of.,1336435200,,182,4.171428571428572
8209217,5,B000TGJ8DA,"I'm a 42-year-old mother of a 7 1/2-year-old and I love this series in my own right.  I have every next DVD pre-ordered.  The story line is psychologically intricate and interesting.  The martial arts are well done - particularly with the isolation of one particular type of move to represent the different nations.  The focus is not even on the fighting but on character development and interactions and plot development.  This is a great series not just for children but for adults as well - even adults without children.  In fact, I like the story more than my son, who would put pokemon and some others ahead of Avatar.  Avatar is more complex that other stories of its genre and done very well.  The first 2 books were indeed spectacular but I can barely wait for the next DVD to come out in this exciting 3rd season.  I guess the first 2 seasons have done a great job of building up the story line to make each dvd of the 3rd season awaited with intense anticipation.",1217030400,2,973,4.482954545454546
