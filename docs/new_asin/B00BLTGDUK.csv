5646893,5,B00BLTGDUK,"The fourth season of ""The FBI"" was as good as it gets.  The show was well formed at this time.  Its formula was well developed.  The stories work well.  Efrem Zimbalist Jr. was the idealized FBI agent.  William Reynolds was the stalwart sidekick partner.  The stories taken from the files of the FBI make for great drama.  The guest stars were a veritable who's who from that time.  This set was great as you get the entire season for one price.",1368316800,8,445,4.407407407407407

This product is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play only"" devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives.""

WHY ON EARTH is a DVD player than can also record on blank discs unsuitable to view DVDs that we have bought and paid for like everyone else? The DVD recording device is not able to record or transfer from any of today's universally ""copy protected"" discs. In this case we are to pay $50 for each season of a television show at least 50 years of age, and for this price are forced to use this product we BOUGHT in only the single, limited manner as has been dictated to the consumer by the manufacturer. Our pricey DVD recorder initially allowed us to re-record our pricey discs in such a manner as to put out-of-sequence episodes back in proper order, in some cases we were eventually able to reconstruct episodes in complete seasons rather than being limited to someone else's idea of ""best of"" (re: always INCOMPLETE) collections; all capabilities removed one at a time, while at the same time the cost of the continually less and less useful DVD collection discs continues only to go higher and higher. Fifty years ago I could have bought a pretty decent TELEVISION SET for what I would now be charged for one season of only one program, with so much fine print on the box one feels if they pause the program to use the toilet, the piracy police will kick in the door and arrest us all.  Yeah technology!!!  :~(

For what possible reason should this be the case? Apparently the DVD-recorder machines, proving too convenient, are now being phased out of production to yet again force customers into purchasing new and, you guessed it, more expensive technology, namely so-called Blue-Ray, at least for now, which in so far as we are yet aware, does not include the capacity to record at home (I have a feeling being able to record onto digital discs at home was ""too"" good, allowing too convenient a manner to bypass too many total rip-off additional purchases, and may not be returning anytime soon). The benefit of purchasing DVDs for complete, uncut episodes is no longer considered a sufficient lure, I suppose, even though any broadcasts of vintage TV one might be able to burn onto their own DVDs at home are so ludicrously butchered for additional commerical space it hardly even compares, not to mention the work of wet-behind-the-ears geniuses who now consider ""vintage"" TV to be mid-l990s reruns. Even burning recordable discs of unedited broadcast movies, such as are broadcast on (and only on) Turner Classic Movies unedited and without commerical interruptions and language ""edits"" - where one hears ""shoot"" and ""dang"" while still being able to clearly read the explicit language issuing from the actors lips, is a highly limited resource to record films with no bonus features or packaging art. Whereas, oddly enough, roughly fifty years ago with the advent of the home Video Cassette Recorder, we could (and can) tape whatever and whenever we wanted from television, and with two machines one could copy virtually any tape that could be rented at Blockbuster...tell me what multi-billion dollar Hollywood entertainment concern went broke from that? They made money when they sold the tape to Blockbuster (or any other home rental agency), who in turn made money when they rented it to their customer, money they would not refund even if it turned out they had rented them a wrong or broken tape. But why settle for those armored car arrivals of eight-figure buckets of cash so long as there yet remains a way to further squeeze dry your customer base as though they are uneffected by an abominal economy and/or possessed of unlimited patience for continually new and more thorough ways of being hosed at every turn?

This constant up-teching midstream is ultimately going to backfire, losing far more consumers who are tired of being shafted and ripped off again and again until they just decide to make do with their collections as is and stop flushing away money on temporary technology that is only destined to be replaced soon by more expensive less capable alternatives.",1363564800,11,4376,4.828
5646897,5,B00BLTGDUK,"This is one of my favorite shows from the past to watch, as it is a Quinn Martin production, and they always bring out the stars. Even in the minor roles they use my favorite charactor actors. With this release, they finally brought it out as a single set. It still comes split into two cases, but they are bundled together. If you read the reviews from season one, the ones that got the most favorable votes complain the program is too pricey. Well, the price has been dropping with the last two releases. Picture quality is in the eye of the beholder, and considering the age of this show, I find it to be acceptable even though it has not been restored. That would probably drive up the price anyways, and I'm content with what I got. Enjoy the show!",1362441600,8,753,4.347517730496454
5646898,5,B00BLTGDUK,"Very pleased with the quality and the packaging. One of my favorite all time cop shows! In fact, all of Quinn Martin's productions were good!

Amazons editorial description does not warn you that the majority of these episodes are the ones hacked for syndication.

5646903,5,B00BLTGDUK,Good old TV show but i don't understand why this series cost is so high. I was really into TV back when I was younger and I am 56 now but I never watch this series that much boy wow when i heard the theme song it brought back memories. It was a great TV series with a great cast and great actors in every show. I give it a 5 star for the series itself and a 3 star for the price.,1376524800,3,379,3.5783132530120483

5646905,5,B00BLTGDUK,"This was our first CD set in the series, and the show scripts held up so well. It has been a joy to watch as the guys who are supposed to protect the public work as a team to get the job done. Each set lists the guests who appear - but be prepared to see your favorites in the role of the villian - even little Ronnie Howard! But, it all ends as it is supposed to end, or at least the way we expect it should end.",1375315200,5,413,3.651685393258427
5646906,5,B00BLTGDUK,"I gave this boxset five stars because it arrived promptly, was in great condition and the episodes so far have been first class with top notch guest stars.
I haven't been watching the episodes in order, but my favourites so far have been: 'The Cober List' (written by the great John D F Black), 'The Nightmare' (guest starring the wonderfully quirky Bruce Dern), 'Wind It Up And It Will Betray You', 'Out Of Control', and 'The Maze' (with great performances from Steve Ihnat and Simon Oakland).
I'm glad to see the dvds are now packaged in clear plastic dvd cases, which has eliminated the problems I experienced with the Season 2 boxset.
By the way, I live in Ireland so I'm delighted that these dvds play over here as I had given up hope of ever seeing this series on tv again. And I now realise that it was never properly shown over here in the first place, ending prematurely with ""Caesar's Wife' in September 1971.
So, I urge all you fans of 'The FBI' series, to buy this boxset. You won't be disappointed!

8570619,2,B00BLTGDUK,"SEE BELOW ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES: - Bought Season 3,4, 8 and 9 from 2 different resellers - all Seasons had MOD Discs with circular markings, scratches and dark blemishes if you buy inspect all your discs

Though there is no remastering or cleanup of any kind (to the best of my knowledge although one season shows Dolby mono but not the others best I can tell), the plain film transfers are quite good. Our Blu-ray/DVD player did a great job on the output presentation with very minimal if any noticeable noise or artifacts even on a 78"" screen where just about every anomaly appears . The picture format was also set to 16:9 vs 4:3 ratio which also maintained very enjoyable (albeit slightly stretched) watching quality. Optimally we set our audio receiver to ""Mono"" which is a match for the audio output on these discs. The audio was not muddy and rather clean but of course it lacked much dimension. Both the music score and voice could be heard clearly without strain (we have a Denon receiver 5.1 sound). Additionally I had also performed an additional satisfactory test by playing one DVD (disc 1) on our computer (non Blu-ray) to a 50"" plasma TV screen and it too appeared quite good as well as the audio which was listened to via good quality closed ear (non ear buds) headphones.
Setting the performances and episodes aside (which I would rate between a 3.5 and 5), all things considered, this would get a 5 star on the straight film transfer to digital on Warner Brothers part. Perhaps for the small ransom they are asking though, surely something else could have been included such as bonus material, interviews, outtakes and so on as with the Quinn Martin ""Invaders"" series where Roy Thinnes has multiple introductions and the unedited pilot was included. The FBI film transfers show minute bits of dust, scratches and other anomalies only on rare occasion. The color prints held up quite well without any noticeable fading or color degradation overall. If you have an audio receiver I'd suggest flipping through your sound modes and check out the mono option if it exists. Overall I would certainly recommend this Season 9 except for the MODS - continue reading.

UPDATE: The packaging itself is a different story. Since we all don't play the disc right away I opted after a few days to inspect all the discs and found markings on Disc 1,2, 5 and 6. Well it gets worse from here. I ordered Season 9 with two damaged discs. Season 4 all seven discs had fine small scratches, two had blotch stains. Season 3 all but one disc had markings. one was acceptable, the others all had small scratches and or circular markings. These MOD discs are unacceptable especially at this price. It's hard to blame the reseller. Season 3 and 4 I had ordered from deepdiscount.com, a different vendor though they resell here on Amazon also. It's difficult to buy another FBI disc until WB remedies this issue. I have written to them with my receipts and evidence of purchase and photos. They have agreed to replace season 8 and 9. Awaiting a reply for Season 3 and 4. I've included a sample image of what you can expect with these discs. I am confident this is clearly a handling issue at the WB plant where they are burned and packaged.",1471046400,,3232,4.648601398601398

8570625,5,B00BLTGDUK,"It is so good to see these shows again. Season 4 is great and although I don't remember many of the episodes because it was so long ago, the nostalgia of those shows, the quality of the acting back then and the story lines along with the familiar actors of yesteryear  are great to watch again. I watch one episode a week because that is the way they originally aired and I am putting my library together so once I have watched the entire season I will get season 5. It is still good, clean television.",1409788800,,502,4.229166666666667
