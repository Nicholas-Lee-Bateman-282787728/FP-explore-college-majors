On YouTube I just watched the video of the theme from that series and nearly fell off my chair!  I still think that is the best crime show ever aired!!  Of course in the 80's I had a small crush on Mike Torello.  Now I have met people who actually knew him in Chicago.  What a Trip!  I loved especially the music and the old cars in every epsode.  Whoever picked the music deserves an award..",1256428800,,564,4.110091743119266
