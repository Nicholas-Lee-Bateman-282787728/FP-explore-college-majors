8219934,3,B000VTQL4Y,"We're in the middle of the dreaded fourth-grade California Mission project.  I bought this because I really wanted my son to get the most out of the project and thought this would add another dimension.  The video is pedestrian -- the narrator literally sounds like she's reading the text for the first time, with difficulty -- but conveys something of what life at this Mission was like.  (This is important because, unlike many of the other missions, it was completely destroyed, the replica that's been rebuilt was based on a since-discredited postcard, and the town of San Rafael has grown up around the site, making it impossible to visualize what must have been there 200 years ago.)

So -- if your child has difficulty absorbing information from books or if you want to try to round out his/her Mission experience, this is worthwhile.  If you're looking for an absorbing, well-made documentary, this is not it.",1232582400,,917,4.890322580645162
