8107032,4,B0001FTD84,"Appealing for the audience interested in cross-cultural issues and the problems of children of Asian 'foreigners' growing up in America. At best, these children grow up with East-West blend of culture and understanding, but the growing pains can be difficult. The value systems of their parents constantly clash with what these children experience outside their homes.

This is the story of an Indian-American college student Kris (Krishna), his mother who is a professor working in a US University, and Leela, a Visiting Professor from India. Kris lives with his mother, a divorced woman, and Leela is in an unhappy marriage with a professional musician play-boy. Leela's husband is in India. The women are colleagues and become close friends.

Krishna is a confused second-generation American who is uncomfortable with his very identity as Indian. He meets the newly-arrived-from India professor Leela, and she opens his eyes to a whole new world of the Orient, with its dignity, simplicity, spiritual wealth, art and science.

Leela and Kris meet often, and there is a one-time sexual intimacy. This is forbidden in any culture, but particularly in the Orient, and all the hell breaks loose. Leela eventually decides to take time to think and find herself, be herself. Kris goes to India with his mother for a visit to see his grandfather. He has new respect and reverence for India.
