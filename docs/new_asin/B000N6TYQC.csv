2758761,4,B000N6TYQC,Even though its probably the worst season ever I'd rather watch this than watch a whole lot of other things so i say if you're a true Survivor Fan than u will buy this season even though its one of the worst so CBS please release the rest of the Survivors please !!!! GO ALL SURVIVOR SEASONS !!!!!!!!!,1323129600,4,301,4.206896551724138
2758762,5,B000N6TYQC,I would love to watch this survivor never seen it so it would be great if it was released on dvd. Also my mother is from fiji so it would make a great gift for her. I'm really disappointed that I didn't get a chance to watch this survivor because of work. I would be working when it was shown on tv so I missed out on probaly a great survivor season. I remember when survivor season 1 came out I was still at school at that time in my life come home and at night it would be on tv. Great times but because I work afternoon shift I miss out on pretty much everything on tv. please released this on dvd and please release the rest that haven't yet been put on dvd thank you bye...,1287964800,2,678,3.920289855072464
2758763,5,B000N6TYQC,"I know that a lot of people didn't like this season and even though it wasn't one of the strongest, I would still rather watch this season as opposed to MOST of the other crap on TV today.

Not only did this season introduce us to some memorable characters, but also some memorable moments. Yau-Man and the hidden idol was one of the greatest scenes in the shows history. My heart went out to Alex, Ed, and Mookie after they got double crossed by Dreamz.

I just wish it would be released on DVD, with all of the other stuff being released, why can't the top reality show of all time get some love as well.",1221091200,4,606,4.2155172413793105

2758906,5,B000N6TYQC,"I enjoy watching all of the Survivor seasons.  What I don't enjoy is the terrible quality of streaming from Amazon Prime.  Constant shut off of every episode.  While viewing most of the episodes, even if I am only 10 to 15 minutes into one, it will stop and the next episode comes up on the screen to be viewed.  I get tired of back tracking and resetting.  I get many messages from Amazon about too little band width, however I can switch immediately to Netflix and it will be working great.  I go back to Amazon, more complaints from them about band width.  Sick of it!!!!",1464652800,,574,4.3584905660377355

2759070,3,B000N6TYQC,"For the third time in a row, a season of Survivor turns out to be quite different from what I thought it would be. I saw this season when it first aired and not much stuck out to me despite the obvious stuff/moments. On the rewatch despite remembering the boot order almost perfectly, it proved to be an interesting season to watch. I actually enjoyed the castaway's forming their alliances and adjusting to changes the game threw at them. This is espically prominant, as this was the last season in a transition phase for the show. While not fast paced all the interactions made the game enjoyable and the merge left me with a good feeling. Having a good winner also helps.

Now the bad stuff, obviously the main twist for the season of haves vs have nots didn't work, without the hidden idols being on Exile Island I feel there is much less purpose to the twist although if these people were a little smarter it could've mattered a lot more (I personally say the show's better without it but whatever). Also the cast did act more along personality lines than strategy, while still keeping quite a lot of strategy in the game. I can definutly say more gameplay happened here than Exile Island.

However I do need to state that I believe a good amount of the bad hype this cast gets should not be happening for two reasons. One, I feel the hype comes from a lot of minor remarks that I feel are always going to happen on reality shows like this, doesn't excuse the remarks but it should be accepted that these remarks take place (having seen 25 seasons of this show and every Big Brother season I've ran these remarks many times). Two, in hindsight I'm seeing a lot of people use the same dislikes for this season that they do with more recent seasons, and given how different the edit for the show is now (no focus on the elements, shorter episodes and a different generation of fans) I think people should throw this seasons a couple more props. If you still dislike it fine, but I think most should agree there is worse than this season.

So ultimatly, I'm glad I rewatched this season. Not the best season ever but better than it was the first time.",1434672000,,2153,4.445569620253164

Many of the eliminations this season were rather obvious, and the big twist (one tribe gets luxury, the other gets nothing) was a massive failure because the tribe with luxury never lost an Immunity Challenge. Most of the eliminations were fairly obvious, and no one really made any big moves. There were a few big personalities that kept things interesting (Rocky, Lisi, Alex, Yau Man, and Dreamz), but from a game standpoint, it was rather slow. Another downside was that, due to political turmoil in Fiji, family members were not allowed to visit, and on a season that already lacked character development, this was an unfortunate part of the show to be excluded. Among the Final Three, the right player definitely won, though I'm sure most fans would have preferred to see a certain someone else take home the title and cash.",1389225600,7,1079,4.837837837837838

The tribe that was stranded in a poor camp with almost nothing, competing with a tribe that had every advantage physically at camp, basically laid down and gave up.  It could easily have gone the other way, with the adversity strengthening and toughening them as they overcame obstacles, but they never overcame any obstacles.  The poor tribe essentially laid around in a cave, not working together to solve any problems or build anything.  They resented, and voted off, anyone who tried to motivate the group to think, plan or get up and do things.

So with an odd number of people they let them choose there own tribes and send 1 person to exile island. When the survivors arrive at their island they build a great shelter before dividing into tribes. When they divide into tribes only 1 tribe can live there. Basically the tribe that lives with the great shelter wins every challenge. There is a tribe switch up and it benefits Yau Man and Earl. These are the only 2 people that you root for. Yau Man is by far the better competitor and should win the game. Dreamz mom was a crackhead so that should tell you how he plays the game. Dreamz makes the most big moves in the game and screws over a bunch of people. Cassandra is one of the most worthless players ever to play the game and its amazing that she gets as far as she does. The winner is unanimous because the two other people at the end pissed everyone off or were just totally worthless. Fiji is probably the coolest location survivor has been and nobody fishes or knows how to use the spear.

2759259,5,B000N6TYQC,I have been a big Survivor fan from Season 2.  I have not finished viewing yet but fully enjoy the antics of the players.,1358380800,,121,4.041666666666667
2759260,4,B000N6TYQC,I really like how they're releasing all the Survivor seasons on DVD. It was a pleasure to purchase and finally own Season 14 of Survivor.,1357948800,,137,4.52
2759261,5,B000N6TYQC,Poduct arrived very quickly and was pacjaged great. The product met all my expectations. I would highlyrecommend to all. I have enjoyed watching.,1357948800,,145,5.3478260869565215
2759262,5,B000N6TYQC,"This is another great season to go into my Survivor DVD Collection.  I hope CBS will make EVERY season available on DVD for us junkies.  The one thing that is missing on the DVD's is the Ponderosa.  These are available on the internet during the season, but it would be great to have one DVD or at least one episode dedicated to the Ponderosa.

2759263,4,B000N6TYQC,Season was only problem. I wanted a different person to win. Otherwise a good seasom. Cant wait til more seasons are available.,1357862400,,127,4.818181818181818
2759264,5,B000N6TYQC,My wife and I love Survivor. We have every DVD available and look to buy more when they can be purchased,1357516800,,104,4.0
2759265,3,B000N6TYQC,"Found this season to be a bit boring...watched it right through, but the contestants were not all that interesting, except Earl & Yauman.",1356825600,,137,5.0
2759266,3,B000N6TYQC,I love Survivor and I'm really glad Amazon is putting these out on dvd.  My only complaint on this one is where are the opening titles on the episodes?  So far this is the only season they have put on dvd missing the openings and I hope it's the only one they do this way! I'm hoping it's an over sight on their part and would be nice if they corrected it and offered an exchange like happens on several dvd's where there is a mistake made and something left out or has a glitch.,1355875200,,479,4.031578947368421
2759267,4,B000N6TYQC,"I forgot about the early plot twists in this season.  It was some of the most interesting that the show has thought up.  I've always said, the game is the invisible player.  Although the players were not the most memorable, there were some amazing moments in the season.

Yua-man selflessly giving up his prize to Dreamz was one, Dreamz showing he was little more than gutter water was another. It actually turned my stomach to watch.  He had the opportunity to look like a man of character, but took the low road instead.

Overall a good season with some memorable moments. A good addition to my Survivor DVD collection.",1355875200,,621,4.651376146788991
2759268,5,B000N6TYQC,"Viewing SURVIVOR on DVD has the advantage of hindsight (I know already who will win).  I can pause to take notes, to track names to have an accounting of who is on which team, who voted for whom, as well as the extras on the DVD not seen on the TV persentation.  The beauty of this DVD style presentation is - no COMMERCIALS.",1354147200,3,325,4.142857142857143
2759269,5,B000N6TYQC,"I really enjoyed watching 'Survivor Fiji', not sure why so many people rank it as one of the worst seasons.  I've been watching Survivor for over five years now and went back to watch this season.  I think it's one of the best.  Yes, there are some double cross, and back stabs - but that is what this game brings every season.",1353801600,11,327,4.241935483870968
2759270,5,B000N6TYQC,"This was fun to re-watch the whole season for 9.99.  You forget what you watched 5 years ago and it was interesting watching when you already know who wins.  I am at the point of the final six and the winner still looks like he could be voted off any minute.  I like it!  They should reuse some of these challenges.  I wish I could see them at Ponderosa too, but I don't know what year Ponderosa started.",1353628800,2,404,4.128205128205129
2759271,5,B000N6TYQC,"I love every episode of Survivor.  This one is no exception.  I'm hoping they'll release all of the seasons but for now, I'll just watch the ones I have over and over.",1353542400,,167,4.1875
2759272,5,B000N6TYQC,"unfortunatley, I seem to be watching the seasons out of order (i can get several seasons on amazon, other ones from different places) - but the season is great - good twists & change-ups - now just get amazon to make all the seasons available...",1352678400,,245,4.466666666666667
2759273,5,B000N6TYQC,"Out of all the 24 seasons of Survivor that have aired so far, there is only one that I never wish to sit through again and that would be the travesty named Redemption Island. I'd have to get that on DVD anyway for completions sake. But anyway, Fiji is considered by many to be one of the worst seasons of Survivor.

Whilst I by no mean think it's up there with the greats, it certainly still has a lot of redeeming features that make it somewhat entertaining and worth a rewatch. It had a lot of big personalities who created drama and some moments of TV gold. Whilst it also had a rather predictable pre-merge and one of the worst twists ever to set of the post-merge, what happened after was an amazing end game with some quality episodes that more than make up for the few weak patches along the way.

So all in all, there is still a lot here for Survivor fans to look forward to because even your lesser seasons of Survivor make for great TV. Except for that one mentioned earlier. I shall be eagerly awaiting my copy, hopefully complete with the official Tightie Whities music video. Fiji wasn't that bad and will be a welcome addition to my DVD collection. Now hurry up with China and Micronesia!",1348531200,2,1202,4.385650224215246
2759274,5,B000N6TYQC,"I love Survivor.  I never saw this season when it originally aired.  I read the other reviews, and even though they claim it was not a really entertaining season, I still want to see it.  Good or bad, I love Survivor.  I am trying to collect all the seasons on DVD.  Hurry up and release this season, please!!!!!!!!!!",1323388800,,317,4.396551724137931
