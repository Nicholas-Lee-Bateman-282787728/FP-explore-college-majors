7153855,4,B00WTHSKMC,"It was a good movie.  I think the point being repeatedly driven home about abuse women suffer was overkill, but overall it was a thought-provoking film.",1439164800,,152,4.846153846153846

7153858,5,B00WTHSKMC,"Excellent movie. A very stirring story of a woman struggling to be respected and raise her children while trapped in an abusive marriage that is enabled by the tribal traditions in Camaroon, which her people uphold. Her husband is a very poor tenant farmer who is abused by the landowner, and his anger and helplessness is then directed towards his wife, whom he considers chattel by dint of having paid her bride-price. One day, a friend comes to tell her that her father is dying and he wishes to see her. Nineh's husband refuses to let her go see him, and she now has come to fear for her life. She makes it to her family home, and later decides to not return to her abusive  husband, even though her children are still there. The ensuing story is gripping and full of unexpected turns.

I would not at all dismiss this film as merely a depressing story, as a previous reviewer claimed. It is full of rich, developed characters and a story that pulls you into itself. And despite the ages old traditions they live under, you can see that others understand the injustices, but are unable to buck those traditions. Not all marriages are like Nineh 's, but you see a few men and women who are hurt from observing her, and yet the viewer can understand the weight these traditions carry. It is heartbreaking to observe the effects on children, as they mature and come to adopt -even reluctantly - those cultural ""rules"". The story ends with a new beginning, but I will not indicate in what way. The characters are full-bodied; and even her abusive husband  engages us emotionally, and we ""get"" where he is coming from and his underlying frustrations. This is an excellent movie and should not be missed. A gem.  It does have English subtitles for about 2/3 of the dialog, and is very unobtrusive. The characters speak a mix of Camaroon/English, mostly English, so you can hear and understand the words, but they have such a heavy accent that the subtitles just help to make it clearer. Don't let this put you off. The cinematography is excellent, and the fierce raw beauty of the setting -- along with its lush dangers, is yet another important character to the story. Please don't pass this movie by.",1432684800,5,2200,4.604591836734694

7153871,2,B00WTHSKMC,"It had some very sad moments to know that in other places in the world women are still just property. That men can use and abuse them and bring up their sons to do so as well. Makes me very grateful that I'm from a very big and loving Italian family and God forbid any man raise his hand against me, my father and long list of brothers will make sure that wouldn't happen again.",1466208000,,378,4.053333333333334

7153878,5,B00WTHSKMC,"A year and a half ago I left an abusive marriage with the help of a local women's shelter, so I could not watch much of this movie because my experiences were just too recent. I will watch more of it at a later time, when I feel I can handle the emotions. The only thing I would say is that abuse is not always this visible in public. Only in a place where social conventions uphold this type of treatment does it seem like a man would be able to demonstrate his abuse in public (though as one reviewer noted, some do not approve of his behavior). Where conventions have changed, abuse goes on in secret. My heart goes out to Ninah, and to every woman her character represents. It seems like a well made film. I hope other viewers will pardon my writing a review after having only watched a short amount.",1440892800,9,804,4.2272727272727275
7153879,5,B00WTHSKMC,"This movie was harrowing. It simply and so vividly tells the tale of an abused woman by her husband; a story and a tragedy being experienced by women worldwide. The pain and the perseverance Nina had to make a better life for herself and to simply survive to be there for her children was felt in every scene. The way woman are treated as inferior, treated as property and nothing more, was heartbreaking. The actors were phenomenal in telling this tale that I'm sure is a reality not only in Africa. It was hard to watch in many scenes but it has made me emphasize more with those who are hurting and living in a culture where women are treated as the least. Nina's dowry was paid in the price of life and $100 could never amount to the blood she shed and the pain she lived through.",1439769600,,784,4.304054054054054
8714194,4,B00WTHSKMC,"The film was inspired by African filmmaker Victor Viyuohs own cousins story and those of thousands of other Cameroonian women.  Ninah (her name here), impressively played by Mbufung Seikeh, is subjected to horrific abuse at the hands of her barbarous husband Memfi (Anurin Nwunembom).  And as many times as she attempts escape, she keeps being forced back, not just by his violence, but, significantly, by the bride price her father was paid when he, in essence, sold her at 14.  She must repay that sum to secure her freedom.  This is an important biopic, shining a powerful light on a long-held cultural and societal norm.  It is well-written and directed, solidly filmed and performed. Sobering is the neglect and disdain Ninah experienced by her own neighbors and community.  Though not a documentary, the film has clear historical importance.",1511049600,,847,5.101449275362318
8714195,4,B00WTHSKMC,"I cant agree with the rave reviews and the 8.4 IMDb rating and would think those are to draw attention to the subject matter of the film. However, after someone is beaten a few times you don't have to repeat it constantly for the audience to get that her husband is abusive and she wants to get away from it all. Its more about what the husband owns and how little its really worth to him and that makes for a pretty depressing film. If you need a movie like this to inform you how some cultures and men view and treat their women then perhaps its worth a view but most should not be surprised by it. The ending is worth the watching and although its based on a gruesome fact its the only thing that motivates anyone to help this poor girl and thats why I gave it 4-stars.",1506211200,,772,4.119205298013245

8714197,4,B00WTHSKMC,"Good movie showing the indomitable spirit of a woman who didn't want to be subjugated. Many scenes were uncomfortable to watch because of the cruelty of her husband's, & indeed, some men's treatment of women & were also downright cruel. However, it shows women that although you might feel alone in a cruel & inhumane male/female relationship,  the will to survive & leave that situation is possible.",1478390400,,400,4.970149253731344
8714198,5,B00WTHSKMC,"As heart breaking it is to watch the movie is well made.....You find yourself wondering where Ninah finds so much strenght to continue to fight for her freedom from such a helish exsitance seeing her strugle shows the power of a womans mind, and spirit when faced with little choice but to move toward better, great movie.",1477008000,2,322,4.666666666666667
