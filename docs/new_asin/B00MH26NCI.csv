8672181,5,B00MH26NCI,Really enjoyable documentary about moonshine and the beginnings of NASCAR. It has the story of early moonshiners (like my grandfather) and how moonshine sales helped feed their families. The story of the moonshine runners and their souped up cars shows how it trained future stock car racers. It progresses into modern whiskey production by small distilleries and then into how organized crime got into the moonshine business.,1419033600,4,426,5.373134328358209
