4237787,4,B00402FGH6,I enjoyed 2 of the movies and those were the ones I especially wanted Chato's Land and Duel at Diablo.  The other 2 movies were okay but not what I expected. The quality of the movies was fine.  I am hoping to enjoy them for some time.  If there is nothing on TV then I go to a good western.  Both of the above mentioned movies fit this bill.,1364774400,,342,3.9130434782608696

4237789,5,B00402FGH6,All 4 of these movies are worth the time of any fan of westerns. Each different in its own way but all are well above average.,1327708800,4,126,3.8846153846153846
8411801,4,B00402FGH6,"I need subtitles -- my hearing has worn out -- and these do NOT have any.
The movies on here are typical good westerns.
I am a real western fan, having seen nearly all of the Gunsmoke episodes beginning with those the the 50's.",1486771200,,227,4.181818181818182

8411806,5,B00402FGH6,"If you like Westerns than this is the one. Holds your interest. Love the first one Chato's Land, but the others were great",1393372800,,122,4.3478260869565215
8411807,3,B00402FGH6,"Picked this disc up because I wanted to see DUEL AT DIABLO as it was filmed in Southern Utah. I'm working on a class dealing with films shot in Utah and this was about the only DVD  obtainable with this title. DUEL is better than average Western. CHATO'S LAND was better than I expected while ESCORT WEST is low budget that's okay. THE RIDE BACK is a minor film but was quite enjoyable. If you like Westerns this set bought at a low price is just fine. The weakness is that disc is old enough that its not really formatted for today's 16x9 sets so some of the films are window boxed. Fortunately ESCORT WEST, which was shot in CinemaScope is in a non-window format. I would have preferred seeing DUEL AT DIABLO in a more current pressing.",1392422400,,738,4.3478260869565215
8411808,4,B00402FGH6,"There are 4 movies on this dvd, 2 out of the 4 were pretty good the others were a bit slow. If you like slow you will love the movies! Shipping was fast and te price was right!",1388707200,,176,3.6578947368421053
8411809,4,B00402FGH6,"Chato's Land has been cleaned up a bit. Chato's wife is wrapped in a blanket to hide the quick glimpses of nudity in the original. I liked Duel at Diable, but the Ride Back should be rated a ""B"" movie.",1386633600,,201,4.05
8411810,5,B00402FGH6,"First of all it's 4 for the price of 1. Second James Garner & Sidney Poitier are magic together along with Bill Travers & Dennis (McCloud) Weaver in the calvary epic Duel at Diablo. The musical score alone is worth the price. Second there is Charles Bronson as a half-breed Apache warrior vs. 13 killers in Chato's Land. The bonus movies boast great stars. 2 time Oscar winner Anthony Quinn battles sheriff William (Cannon) Conrad. And Victor (Samson) Mature, legendary character actor Slim Pickens & Harry Carey Jr. star in Escort West.",1385856000,4,537,4.8478260869565215
