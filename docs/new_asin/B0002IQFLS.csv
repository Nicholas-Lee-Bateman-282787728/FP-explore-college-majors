8471922,1,B0002IQFLS,I have not seen the series but I don't doubt it will be decent. This review is for the outrageous prices some of the sellers are asking. Upon trying to complete the series I realized two of the DVDs are selling for ridiculous prices (Vol 8 & 10) and are used! Two are unavailable (Vol. 11 & 12). It's sad that ADV films went under. I doubt I'll ever be able to complete the series due to these factors as well as they other collectors of the series.,1476835200,,449,4.113636363636363
