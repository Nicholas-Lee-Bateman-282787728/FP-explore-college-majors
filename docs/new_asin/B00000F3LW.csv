A wonderful English production that doesn't shy away from male to male kissing or a very small amount of incidental nudity- how do the Brits get things so right ?",1189296000,2,338,4.136363636363637
7907053,5,B00000F3LW,"Forbidden Passion is a biography of the life and times of Oscar Wilde, a playwright and poet, and an advocate for the Aesthetic Movement in England.  He believed strongly that art should be appreciate for the beauty of art.  He also discovered his passions ran deeply in his personal life with loves of many forms for his wife, two boys, and many male lovers.  However, one lover was the end of his career, and this is what the movie focuses on.  Although this movie highlights certain aspects of his life and the beauty of his own contribution to art, I was left wanting more.  I wanted more not because the movie was lacking, but because it encouraged my thirst for more information about Wilde and his published works.  Any fans of Oscar Wilde will enjoy the movie for the eloquent betrayal of his views and pose as an aesthetic.  But this is not a movie for those with strong beliefs against love in all forms and all people no matter race or sex.  This is a movie for Oscar Wilde fans and those who believe in aestheticism.  Although anyone with an open mind may find they thoroughly enjoy the movie.
  While Forbidden Passion shows the accomplishments, and passion Wilde had in his life, it doesn't zone in on the mistakes or negative aspects he had during his years.  To do that, would take away from the point of view the movie sends out.  However, they do show his strained relationship with his wife and society, which allows us to see the choices he made (whether the audience considers them right or wrong).
  Fans of this movie will also find the movie 'Velvet Goldmine' interesting, for it is based on the aesthetic beliefs and writings of Oscar Wilde.  He is loosely mentioned in this movie, but his ways, beliefs, and literature are used with a new generation.
  This is a movie that is joining my collection, and will be viewed often.",1075766400,,1851,4.557575757575758

I have two related reservations: Oscar Wilde was a person not an emblem of a cause. To use him to demean homophobia is to fail to see the total person warts and all. Wilde was a man of great courage and nobility--and a wonderful writer. That said, he ignored and finally left, I suppose one could say, his equally couraguous waife Constance who, ill and humiliated, really had no where to go in those sexually toxic times.
Second: Wilde took no interest in the Dreyfus case which is shameful of him. Worse he loved to drink with Esterhazy (the real spy) in London. This is worse than shameful. Wilde could have been an heroic person but these moments descreetly cut out of the film prevent us from calling him other that courgeous.
I could have done without the sexual explicitness which I find with rare exception(Schindler's List) never does anything to help a film and is a cheap way of making a sensational point--script and carefully crafted production should do.
See this movie by all means to understand this noble man. Keep in mind that any person has failings. The film would not have sufferred from dealing with them. Above all read his work!",1048118400,5,1279,4.688888888888889
