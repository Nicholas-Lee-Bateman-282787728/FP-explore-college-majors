8518398,5,B007JMG2SG,"When I bought this DVD, I had watched lots of online videos on Zhineng Qigong practice available in Chinese and in  English as well as attended a local weekend workshop with an instructor from China. Still, I learned a lot more from this DVD than I have done elsewhere. It is worth the time  to watch again and again periodically to maintain a more accurate practice. I experience greater effects from my practice when I follow the detailed instructions of the DVD. Since I am setting aside time each day for Zhineng Qigong, I want to do it right.",1428537600,7,547,4.515151515151516
8518399,5,B007JMG2SG,"I got the 101 Miracles of Natural Healing DVD by L. Chan about a year ago and started practicing 1 - 2 times a day.  It is good, but only covers the basic movements.  I figured if I was going to invest this much time every day into a practice, I should get it right.  I am so glad I purchased the ""Do's and Don'ts"" DVD.  Sure enough, I was doing a lot of the movements wrong.  I did not realize the ""push-pull"" movement was so complex.  This DVD is well worth the investment and is highly recommended.  Not crazy about the background music, but you can mentally tune it out.",1424822400,4,574,4.117117117117117
