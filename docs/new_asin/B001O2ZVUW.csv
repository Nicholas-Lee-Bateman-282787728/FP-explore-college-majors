It's a pretty long DVD. There are a few songs that are in their full version as well, so it isn't all just clips. What's cool is that you get to see a lot of concerts from different countries. It would have been nice to have a real concert, but this is basically the ""best of"" concert moments. For the price, it is worth buying. I actually enjoyed watching this and think if you don't have any other Dir en grey concert on DVD, you will enjoy this as well.",1247011200,,614,3.9596774193548385
3726552,2,B001O2ZVUW,"The release date was set for Feb 3rd, then it got pushed up because of a ""Manufacturing Error,"" well I finally got my hands on the DVD (bought it for $13 at Hot Topic), watched it all the way through... let's just say, it left ALOT to be desired. Nowhere on the box is there an actual tracklisting of the SONGS (which would've been helpful in determining whether or not it was a worthy purchase).

Excluding the 3 extra and UNNECESSARY repeats of ""Dead Tree"" (and the 30 second teasers) there are only 11 full songs on this DVD. It also focuses mainly on their album ""The Marrow of a Bone,"" (with a little Vulgar and WtD thrown in) but it stupidly omits the two BEST songs from it; The Pledge and Namamekashiki Ansoku. Also, Obscure is on there, but it's just a snippet. The sound quality varies from GREAT to ""omfg, the distorted fangirl screams are going to destroy my effing speakers and my eardrums!""

Oh well, what can you expect of a DVD that is mainly composed of Fan Club material? My advice (unless you're a srs bizniss hXc Diru fan who absolutely must have EVERYTHING they put out or you'll feel like a failure as a fan) is to save your money and wait for The End Records to sell a cheaper U.S. re-release of Diru's ""The Rose Trims Again"" japanese tour DVD, it has 25 songs on it, plus 2 bonus discs.

Oh what's that? They're only releasing it through TheOmegaOrder as an $80 import? Well that sucks, maybe someday they'll get around to recording an actual U.S. concert DVD with a good setlist and good sound. I'm not going to hold my breath of course.",1236211200,5,1562,4.379310344827586
3726553,3,B001O2ZVUW,"I was excited to get a tour dvd by Dir en grey that wasn't $90, and it came with a STICKER!
But my excitement quickly diminished when I watched this dvd. It has poor audio quality and video quality. A lot of the clips I can hardly hear Kyo singing (or screaming) over Shinya's drums or the guitars.
The other two tour dvds I have are packed with more backstage footage, which makes the DVD worth buying. In this DVD, very little footage backstage was provided. There was a clip of when Kaoru and Toshiya was on tv, but it was only 10 seconds long!

Very disappointed. I kept it to support the band, and have some lulz at Kyo's tantrums on stage (even if you can't really hear him)",1234569600,,680,4.230769230769231
3726554,4,B001O2ZVUW,"I just finished watching my DVD of A Knot Of, and boy is it a beast. If you've ever wondered how Diru sound/look live, now is the perfect time to pick up this DVD.

The DVD chronicles concerts from all over the world, from numerous tours starting in 2005 and ending in 2007. The songs used in the DVD are their albums Vulgar, Withering to Death, and Marrow of the Bone, but I noticed a majority of the songs came from the first two albums I listed (which is a good thing for most). The footage is intense, with Kyo running the gamut of his wide range of emotional antics and vocal styles. You'll also see Toshiya, Shinya, Die, and Kaoru rocking out hard, but of course most of the antics belong to Kyo.

The content itself is 85 mins, so it's not that long of a DVD and obviously doesn't show entire setlists (sometimes even songs get cut off). This would be a major problem if the footage was boring or uninteresting and more expensively priced, but the majority of the fans who will buy this DVD will already know what they're getting into with this purchase.

My only two complaints about this DVD are the varying qualities in both video and audio. I obviously can't fault them too much for this, since the footage is from dozens of shows and obviously it will all look and sound different. I'd be lying though if I said the changes in audio and video quality weren't noticeable, because they definitely are.

In the end, if you're a big fan of Diru and have never had the chance to see them live then please support the band and buy this DVD. If you're a fan and have been lucky enough to catch a live show as I have, I would still recommend this DVD because you get to see the various ways they have performed throughout their years as a band (at least a tiny glimpse, through the VK-style of Vulgar to the industrial style of Withering and the grunge of Marrow).

Overall a 5-star DVD that I unfortunately will knock to 4 due to the varying audio and video quality. Everything is still audible and easy to see, but it does become a distraction.",1234483200,4,2050,4.342036553524804

8329186,4,B001O2ZVUW,"It was a bit uneven in the beginning, like it had some difficulty deciding just what movie it wanted to be.  For example, there were a couple of spots of ""gross out humor"" that didn't really fit the tone of the rest of the movie.  It really got going about halfway through though and from that point on I loved it.",1404432000,,314,4.131147540983607
