2047341,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys had many wonderful seasons; however, season four is my favorite, and likely their best! There are just so many great episodes to enjoy in this season; far too many to name. It's enough just to have these episodes at my convenience, but added are the extras! I love the interviews; it's wonderful to hear what the people who made the show thought of their work! I highly recommend this set for all action fans!",1089072000,3,442,4.67948717948718
2047342,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Season four of Hercules is a great season! There is so much to love about it! My favorite aspect of this season involves the crossover episodes with Callisto and Hope, and Xena and Gabrielle. There are so many great episodes to enjoy over and over again! This is a must have for all television fans!",1088726400,3,299,4.454545454545454
2047343,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Season 4 is hitting American stores! Time for us British to storm your barricades! At least, as far as this store goes..! :
Season 4 of Hercules is released on 13th July... OK, so it's not UK Region, but if you have a DVD computer player or a multi-regional, (which I'm working towards!) it's worth having a look at..! The UK release'll take a thousand years - By then, Ancient Greece will be beyond pre-historic!!!
I can't be without every opportunity to see my darling Iolaus, personally... But there is always the lovely Mr. Sorbo to catch up with, 'cos thanks to Wolf, a month later, he's coming over to meet us all..!! (THANK YOU AGAIN, WOLF!!!! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)
Read farther, into the Extended Text, it'l be worth it..!!!
I do love Kevin, but Dylan does for me what Herc doesn't - I'm too busy looking at Michael Hurst!! That having been said, I have the same problem when GMW appears next to his leading man..! I always turn to these shows for Kevin, and end up falling for his blond side-kick... (You boys'll know what I mean with your alternative, Lisa Ryder!)... Actually, Lexa had a lot to do with my tuning into Andromeda after SG4, so it's also her fault I'm here, advertising Season 4 of HTLJ, cos she led me to see what else Kevin had been up to..!!!
Oh, and another thing, this season contains episodes such as 'Reunions', and 'Top God', which guest stars Roy Dotrice, recently seen playing Wesley's father in ANGEL... He and Anthony Quinn are my equal favourites of all the Zeuses to choose from, AND, in this episode, we see one of those COOL brother on brother fights between the 2 Kevins: Sorbo, and another man I'm utterly in love with, (!) KEVIN SMITH..!!! Starring alonsgside them both, would be Meg Foster (Hera) whom is recognisable to DS9 fans, from the Season 4 Jake Sisko episode 'Muse'....
Enough reasons to part with your cash..!?? No?? Well, Scott Michaelson, (Brad from Neighbours!) the man whom once snogged Natalie Imbruglia for a living, makes his presence known as Apollo in 2/3 episodes..!!
Season 4 has EVERYTHING that makes H:TLJ GREAT...!!! It has IOLAUS, it has ARES, it has HERCULES... It has fun, fantastic fight choreography, the continual return to the HERO mythos, and morals... It also allows for the telling of some heartfelt family stories. Beginning with Twighlight, in which we see the inception of the YOUNG HERCULES series, (option: do you prefer Ian, the first, or Ryan..??? They're lovely, but personally, I prefer Dean & Chris! Don't let the teenage label put you off - These younger boys can kick ass, and in TWIGHLIGHT, they do just that!)we are told the tale of Hercules most sorrowful separation, that from his mother, played by Liddy Holloway... Alcemene whom saw him through all else that cut deep in his life, lives on in the Elysian Fields. The acting of Kevin Sorbo, Michael Hurst, and Jeff Thomas, (esp.) when she has passed over, it is of worth in their field... TOP GOD furthers this. REUNIONS furthers it still... IOLUAS is reuntied with his flesh and blood mother, after being told by Jeff Thomas' Jason that Alcemene (Liddy, Herc's Mom/Mum!) thought of him as her son also... The only thing missing from this trilogy of stories is the on-screen appearance of a young Iphicles. I'd've liked to have seen whom they picked to be Kevin Smith (Any such pre-desposed person of that preference would at least be curious to imagine the man whom would grow to be the Iphicles we know - Would he look like Kevin Smith did in Desperate Remedies!? - Oh, please, God, I hope so!!! Beautiful!)...",1088726400,,3554,4.706260032102729
2047344,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Season Four of HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS is going to be great! Not only is it a season we've never seen before on either DVD or videotape but it also features such great episodes like ""Web of Desire"" (Introducing Nebula), ""Heroes Heart"" (Are Hercules and Iolaus really parting?), ""Stranger in a Strange World"" (Introduction the black clad ""Sov"" as well as alternate Iolaus), ""And Fancy Free"" (Introduction the Widow Twanky) and the classic ""Armageddon Now"" with guest stars Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor as Xena and Gabrielle. And if that doesn't grab you, how about Kevin Smith playing both Ares and Iphicles (""War Wounds"") this season? There is so much to look forward to! I can hardly wait!",1088640000,,701,4.9491525423728815
2047345,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Hercules returns with his best friend, Iolaus, to face the those who we have never seen before. The season 4 dvd set is a really thrilling episode. Humor played a major role in the adventures of Hercules and Iolaus. The new characters are amazing and take you through a lot of fun and wild adventures.

 These myths and legends of Hercules include a selection of reality in the episode, ""Yes Virginia, There is a Hercules"" which was a very humorous one. You will not get such an argument from the story either. The suspense will not leave you unsatisfied because the story and the scripts written in the play are unforgettable. I really enjoyed the lines from ""Stranger in a Strange World"" from the evil Hercules, the Sovereign, in which there are two worlds and everyone on this opposite side of the world behave with opposite character traits.

 I must say that this is where the real fun begins. For the first time, we see Hera in full human form and a flashback of the young hercules is given an appearence. One of the best parts about viewing the dvd content is the video and audio commentary, along with interviews with the cast and the crew. Its exciting to hear about that the actors feel about the episode, what they think of the other characters and how they feel about them.

 Bruce Campbell is a plus in this series as well as the comedy that goes with it. I don't think he is the only reason that made this series funny, some of the episodes like Stranger in a Strange world were funny because stars like Kevin Sorbo were Fancy Free. As Kevin Sorbo would like to put it, this season of Hercules is a HOOT! The MSN chat of Kevin Sorbo which took place recently on Monday, July 12th revealed to us that Kevin's favorite season of Hercules was season 4 as well as mine.

 The fighting scenes and hero's actions draw much attention quickly to the the fans, but to even out the odds, there are always dramatic scenes as well. The stars of the show enjoyed shooting this series the most and its worth your money to purchase the set while it comes with exclusive bonus features. Xena Season 3 DVD set is really good to go with the story line of these 22 episodes, because it really puts a mark on what Rob Tapert is producing in the shows together at the same time. Altogether, this season is definately going to be added to my Hercules dvd collection, and you don't have to be a Hercules fan to purchase the set. Any SciFi-Fanatic would love to watch the episodes of season 4 over and over again.",1088640000,11,2503,4.426086956521739
2047346,5,B0001ZX0CY,"I loved the Hercules series. I already purchased the first 3 series and can't wait for the 4th to be in my collection. The suspense is killing me. If you are a true fan of this series, you need to get that bad boy!!",1088640000,,215,3.909090909090909
2047347,5,B0001ZX0CY,"I can't waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait until Hercules Season 4 comes out July 13th. I've already purchased Hercules Season 1, 2, 3 and now I'm waiting for season 4. This season was one of my all time favourite seasons from hercules. I especially loved the episodes such as Stranger in a Strange World were Herc and Iolaus find themselves in parallel worlds, each saddled with lookalikes of the other who act very differently. Men in Pink were on the run from phony murder charges, Autolycus and Salmoneus change their names to Autolyca and Salmonella and join Widow Twanky's all-female dance troupe. Armageddon Now Part 1 were evil Hope frees Callisto and sends her back in time to keep Hercules from being born and Part 2 Hercules is trapped in the nether world with his evil double, while Iolaus tries to prevent Callisto from killing Alcmene. And how can anyone forget this one...drum roll please...Yes Virginia, There is a Hercules were The writers and producers of ""Hercules"" panic when the star of the show is nowhere to be found following an earthquake in modern day Los Angeles.",1088121600,4,1086,4.939890710382514

2047349,5,B0001ZX0CY,"I have already got Seasons 1,2 and 3 and have not been disapointed and can't wait for Season 4 that's commming out on the 13th June. Season 4 has everything you would want and more, new gods and a young Hercules.  So if you are a Hercules fan, or not this DVD Box Set is a great addition to your DVD library.  Buy Seasons 5 and 6, they are worth it and will also make a great addition to your DVD library.  I have already pre-oreded Hercules Season 4 from Amazon, and can't wait to see what extras have been included.",1082937600,2,517,4.099009900990099
2047350,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Hercules Gets better in this season because they introduce different gods like Discord, the full body of Hera, the evil daughter of dahak(hope) and we also see more of Areas and Strife.
The season is also great because Hudson Leick(Callisto) guest stars on two episodes, and also xena and gabrielle are on an episode. Heracles' mother Elcemeny dies and Heracles becomes a full god. Other great things about the season was the alternate dimension, where there is an evil Heracles, and there is an episode about Atalanta. This should be bought with xena season 3 and people who are fans and non fans.",1082592000,7,598,4.815533980582524

2047369,4,B0001ZX0CY,"I used to watch this show when I was a kid. I'd stay up until 3am over the weekend to watch the reruns on TV because we didn't have the original channel they aired on. Rewatching this series all these years later sure is different! The stories are still fun but the dialog is a lot more corny than I remember it being.  The only episode I really can't stand is the one where he's dancing. It has it's funny moments but even when I was a kid, I remember not liking that particular episode.

The product itself was decent quality. Arrived new and factory sealed like it was supposed to with no damage to the case or discs and everything played okay.",1463616000,,647,4.252032520325203

I was wanting Season 4 anyway (Lucy Lui and Corey Everson are guest stars in that season), but still would like to order Season 1. Wonder what I'll get next time I order Season 1? But as to the series, hey, I love it. Kind of campy, but some good messages to the stories, lots of fun action, some nice comedy, some nice jokes and puns relating to other movies, and, uh, ahem, the women. Thank the gods for the women. And lady viewers have plenty of eye candy as well.",1457827200,,526,4.166666666666667

2047494,4,B0001ZX0CY,"Been very happy with Universal's re-release of the Hercules and Xena tv shows. I don't mind 5 episodes per disc, but I do lament the loss of the special features that were on the original sets, particulary commentaries and bloopers. Oh well. As to how this season of the show went....It isn't as awful as I had recalled nor as bad as it's reputation. Sorbo, as we all know, had a blood clot and had to take it easy for a bit. Not so great for a stunt heavy show. Cue the creativity. Porkules.....was not that bad. Thankfully, the Xenaverse has great supporting characters, namely Autolycus, Iolaus, and Salmoneus. Autolycus (The legendary Bruce Campbell) takes over the show whenever he's own. Widow Tanky is quite hilarious. And the Xena crossovers are always fun. However, I was a bit dissapointed with the Herc vs. Hera throwdown in the season finale. Luckily, she'll be back and doing so more deliciously evil things. Overall, not bad at all. Whatever Hercules season 4 may be, it's at least very entertaining.",1402358400,,1014,4.767045454545454

I have found no aid so great as that of making the mind follow the body movements.  The motion of an awning  mind are not only very jerky and wasteful but they are exceedingly quick.  Such a mind vibrates with the speed again destructiveness of lightning, and the owner simply cannot compel it to be absolute be quiet.  But he can direct as well as to a very great extent.  By directing the mind to follow the body motions, which are infinitely slower than mental motions, he can accomplish great things to ward quieting the line.  By a little practice the mind catches a slower, more regular vibrations of the body, after which it is quite possible still further quiet it to a complete standstill as in making the mind a blank.",1397865600,,948,4.47093023255814

2047566,4,B0001ZX0CY,"Update: This particular Season 4 boxed-set was published quite a few years ago. As of 2013, another Season 4 set has become available. I prefer the 2013 option. It's more compact & easier to store; it's more conveniently formatted; all the episodes provide subtitles (whereas subtitling was omitted from one of the episodes in this older edition)... AND the newer edition is currently less expensive.

If you're viewing this for the 1st time you can count on season 4 to continue to provide the action, drama, comedy & melodrama of previous seasons. Added this season are: Hercules' past; even a little music & dance; some new characters to cheer & to hiss.

Aspects of this season are a departure from previous seasons. While some episodes are hilarious, others seem to reflect a new need to be heavily meaningful. Of course, the show was evolving, and perhaps Sorbo's health crisis was a large factor also. I don't know.

Whether due to health or promotional tours or whatever, Kevin Sorbo is perhaps on screen less in this season than any other BUT season 4 episodes are as entertaining as any - in some cases, more so. The writers came up with extremely creative ways to deal with less on-screen Sorbo time. I actually didn't notice it until it was pointed out to me.

I'm sure Hercules enthusiasts will enjoy season 4, but may prefer the newer edition. While this older edition provides lovely pictures within the old style packaging, the old-style menus are pretty awkward - cycling you through a series of choices before each episode, then automatically returning you to the main menu (to be ""re-cycled"") after each episode.

Overall, I was happy with this purchase, but happier with my subsequent purchase of the 2013  release of Season 4.",1336176000,,1747,4.845637583892618

I also always appreciated the fact that they stayed clean with this show, making it okay for the younger crowd to watch.  I think that was a lot of the appeal to me.

2047586,5,B0001ZX0CY,"I've enjoyed all the seasons of Hercules and this one is no exception. As with the other seasons, the audio and video transfer to DVD is very acceptable.  It may not be the best season of Hercules ever, and we don't have anything that compares to the Golden Hind episodes from Season Three. However, this season is still highly entertaining with plenty of creativity and humor from the writers.  I even liked seeing Hercules as a pig in Porkules!

I always like seeing Lucy Lawless  come back as Xena, and she stars in two episodes, as noted below.

1. Beanstalks and Bad Eggs: Hercules sets out to find the kidnapped Lianna, and finds her caring for the Harpies' three golden eggs.
2. Hero's Heart: The goddess of luck, in an effort to erase one painful incident, erases all of Iolaus' memory.
3. Regrets... I've Had a Few: Death comes for Jaris, an old friend of Hercules.
4. Web of Desire: While burying a trunk of stolen jewels, a pirate captain is attacked by Arachne, half woman and half spider.
5. Stranger in a Strange World: gs: Lucy Lawless: A vortex into a parallel universe reveals different roles for Hercules, Xena, Zeus, Iolaus, and the Sovereign.
6. Two Men and a Baby: Nemesis leaves her six-month old son with Hercules, and tells him that he is the father.
7. Prodigal Sister: Hercules frees a blind boy from slavery. When they find his sister, they find her to be an Amazon warrier who believes she was abandoned by her parents.
8. ...And Fancy Free: Hercules volunteers to be Althea's partner in a dance competition.
9. If I Had A Hammer: When Hercules poses for a museum centerpiece, the resulting sculpture comes to life.
10. Hercules on Trial: When a Hercules impersonator is killed, Hercules is blamed and put on trial.
11. Medea Culpa: On a quest to kill one of Hera's deadly pets, Medea falls in love with Hercules and Jason falls in love with Medea.
12. Men in Pink: When accused of murder, Salmoneus and Autolycus hide out by dressing up as performers in an all-girl dance troupe.
13. Armageddon Now (1) Gabrielle's daughter frees Callisto and asks her to kill Hercules. Callisto goes back in time to kill Hercules' mother.
14. Armageddon Now (2) gs: Lucy Lawless: Iolaus goes back in time to stop Callisto from killing Hercules mother but fails.
15. Yes Virginia, There is a Hercules: Kevin Sorbo, the star of Hercules is missing after an earthquake in Los Angelos. The staff have an emergency meeting to decide how to replace him.
16. Porkules: Hercules is turned into a pig and is befriended by a female pig, Katherine.
17. One Fowl Day: Katherine is turned into a woman by Aprhodite.
18. My Fair Cupcake: Autolycus introduces his former girlfriend, Cupcake, to Prince Alexandros. Actually, Autolycus wants to steal a jewel from the prince.
19. War Wounds: Hercules' brother's wife is killed. Hercules' brother, the king of Corinth, blames Ajax's warriors.
20. Twilight: As his mother is dying, Hercules remembers when he, Jason and Iolaus fought the Parthans invading Caylan territory.
21. Top God: Zeus asks Hercules to help him rule the gods of Olympus.
22. Reunions: Hercules learns the real reason that Zeus asked him to join him on Olympus.",1100304000,57,3177,4.7481884057971016
2047587,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Hercules The Legendary Journey's was continually one of the best shows on TV during it's run. Season 4 stayed true to the show and true to the things that made it a smash success.

Season 4 contains all 22 episodes. The DVD doesn't really contain all that many extras, but there are some. There is commentary by directors, Kevin Sorbo, and William Hurst on some of the episodes. The DVD is spread out over eight discs.

I loved the episode ""Beanstalks and Bad Eggs."" It had a nice Jack and the Beanstalk tale to it and it has the King of Thieves Autolycus played by the master himself Bruce Campbell. It's a great funny episode.

Stranger in a Strange World is another great episdoe. It was the first time to my knowledge in the series that they did an alternate universe episode and they did a good job on this one. They did it more as a comedy and they do a good job with it. All the characters are the opposite to the who they normally are. It's also a good episode because Aphrodite is in it who is played by the lovely Alexandra Tydings.

Yes, Virginia, There is a Hercules is another good episode.  Porkules is another great episode where Hercules is turned into a pig by Discord who is doing it to impress Ares. The episode also has Autolycus in it.

The follow up to Porkules One Fowl Day is another great episode. Discord is turned into a chicken by Iolaus and Autolycus. Ares promises revenge against the two and chains them together. It's a funny tale as the two are running through Greece together trying to get away from each other. In the meantime Hercules is escorting the pig he met in Porkules who ends up getting the body of Aphrodite. It's a great funny episode.

Disc 8 is a special CD Rom disc that is packed full of extras. It contains Chronicles, Trivia, Bios, and Mythology on all the characters mentioned in the show. There is some nice stuff and you can really learn a lot about the show. Disc 7 contains some extras about the show including how they brought all the monsters to life on the show.

This is one of the best seasons of the show. It's equal to the previous three and I'm glad to say that I own all of them. If you loved watching this show when it was on, you have to pick these seaons up. If you love mythology you will also want to pick these up. You won't regret it.",1094515200,7,2307,4.299539170506913
2047588,5,B0001ZX0CY,"Hercules Season 4 delivered once again with its thrilling episodes. In this season, Hercules returned with his best friend, Iolaus, to face new characters and greater obstacles. For a change, humor was a major element in the adventures of Hercules and Iolaus. The audience is taken on a journey of fun and wild adventures with the main characters.

The adventure began with ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" in which the writers brought an updated version with its usual wacky humor. In this episode, Hercules and Autolycus, The King of Thieves (Bruce Campbell), paired up to fulfill the request of an old woman. Autolycus brought a lot to this episode and allowed Hercules to play off him.

The myths and legends of Hercules also took a new twist with, ""Yes Virginia, There is a Hercules"" which again was a very humorous episode. The script was well written and will surely leave the audience with enough suspense to keep on watching to see how the following episodes develop.

In ""Stranger in a Strange World,"" Ares and Hercules fought as Zeus interceded to stop them by throwing a powerful series of lightning bolts that open a dimensional rift to a parallel universe where all the characters have doppelgangers to the usual universe. This was one of those episodes that were designed to be a comedy, but had serious overtones. The audience is treated to some familiar characters and exciting plot lines.

In ""Porkules,"" the writers drew their ideas from the movie Babe. Autolycus stole the magic bow of Artemis and it fell into the hands of Discord, who promptly changed Hercules into a pig. Then Autolycus and Iolaus fought to save the day with hilarious results. I enjoyed watching more of Bruce Campbell as his spiced up the episode with even more humor!

The season ended with ""Reunions"" as Hercules decided to accept the offer and managed to help some people before Zeus's true motivations became clear. Hera finally got to fight him head on and the results were pretty interesting and eventful. This was a good ending since the audience was brought full-circle, but is urged to continue the journey with the return of Hercules.

Season 4 DVD has awesome video and audio commentaries with the cast and crew. I really enjoyed the fun and insightful interviews with the cast and the crew. It's exciting to hear about what the actors felt about the episodes, what they thought of the other characters, and how they worked in the production. In each case, they outlined some of the problems and some of the funnier moments shared on the set, as well as background information on the episode.

There is also a CD ROM that includes Director and cast biographies, a trivia game, and a database of trivia called The Hercules Chronicles. The other extras included are a photo gallery and an interesting featurette. I definitely recommend any fan to purchase this DVD box set because of all the bonus features made it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the video and audio are of great quality for this set. This is probably one of the best Hercules box sets!",1090713600,8,3041,4.825335892514396
2047589,4,B0001ZX0CY,"In the tradition of  Hercules The Legendary Journeys,  that was established after  it became a regular series as opposed to a run of two-hour  made-for-tv movies, humor plays the largest role in this season.  Improperly done, this would have fallen horribly flat but, as it stands and taken for what it is, this is easily the wittiest and most creative season of the series as Kevin Sorbo comes into his own as a  comedic straight man/action hero.
  In the season opener, ""Beanstalks and Bad Eggs"",  Hercules and Autolycus (played brilliantly by Bruce Campbell) are out to rescue Lianna, who had been kidnapped by the giant Typhoon and taken to a castle in the clouds.  Upon climbing a giant beanstalk, the two unlikely partners find Lianna in Typhoon's castle, caring for three golden eggs that belonged to the Harpies.  Without spoiling the rest, the high points to watch are Autolycus' explanation of the art of love and one of the classic lines of the series concerning the harpies.
  The usual mixture of Pop Culture references, legend, myth and fairy tale which, though strange bedfellows are somehow a great combination, permeate this seasons episodes.  In ""Hero's Heart"" we have a standard episode where Iolaus (Hercules' sidekick played by the very talented Michael Hurst) loses his memory and ends up fighting his best friend.  Although this has been done to death in the science fiction/fantasy genres, it plays well in the Hercules universe.
  There are three homages to modern cinema in this set.  ""...And Fancy Free"" is Hercules The Legendary Journeys' answer to ""Dirty Dancing.""  ""My Fair Cupcake"" is obviously based on ""Pygmalion"" which later became the musical ""My Fair Lady"" from which the title is derived and centers around the character of Autolycus and his former girlfriend.  Thirdly, the high point of the season in movie rip-offs, ""Men in Pink.""  A completely undisguised send-up of ""Some Like It Hot,"" is worth the price of the set by itself.
  In what becomes in later seasons a reoccurring event, the episode  ""Yes Virginia, There is a Hercules"" introduces us to ""reality"" as some of the many regular stars of the show take on the interesting task of playing the crew and production staff of  Hercules The Legendary Journeys.  It seems  that after an earthquake in Los Angeles, Kevin Sorbo has disappeared and chaos insues.  There are in jokes we only now as casual viewers become privy to in an incredibly enlightening commentary on this one.
  There are no lack of continuitous episodes and guest appearances from the sister series/spin-off Xena Warrior Princess but, at this point  I felt the two series had diverged in respect to tone.  Hercules, and rightly so, will always be heavily influenced by Sam Raimi and his unique sense of humor which is shared by series regular Bruce Campbell who directs a large portion of this seasons best.  There are very good reasons that ""cross-overs"" were rare soon after these episodes though.
  When all is said and done, this is money well spent and I just watched them all on a lazy summer day and have no regrets about time spent.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the series while it was on or even want a little taste of the action and humor of the Spider-man movies.  This is the same creative staff.",1089676800,22,3280,4.845045045045045

These actors are so great, they are fun to watch, and they are wonderful. The story writers are superb as well. The stories written for season four are the best. The writers and actors are great when it comes to drama, and when it's about the comedy! I love how versatile everyone involved in this show is; it's truly a pleasure to watch over and over. Out of season four there are numerous episodes I consider to be favorites, but I think the comedies are the best.

The extras are also a wonderful incentive, I love to listen to the cast and crew interviews and to watch the extra features!

2047594,4,B0001ZX0CY,"Once again, it's time to relive the adventures of everyone's favorite hero, Hercules.  As said in the title, despite a few setbacks this year, season four has its masterpiece moments.
However, the setback mentioned is the aneurysm Kevin Sorbo suffered in his left arm, which not only limited his effectiveness for half of the season, but almost killed him.  As a result, TPTB decided to revolve the episodes around the surrounding cast, and ended up with some of the strangest shows ever put on television (i.e. PORKULES - just watch it, believe me).
Anyhoo, major events that happen this season (I'll try not to give away too much):
Nebula joins up, Discord comes, Strife goes, Alcmene jumps off the moral coil, Apollo makes a flashback appearance, Herc and Iolaus find a couple of strange versions of themselves, Iphicles finds out what a pre-historic Vietnam can do to an army's morale, Zeus comes to earth in a third form, and Hera's eyes actually acquire a body, not to mention a massive crossover story arc where almost everyone that had a special guest star credit at some time strut across the screen.
