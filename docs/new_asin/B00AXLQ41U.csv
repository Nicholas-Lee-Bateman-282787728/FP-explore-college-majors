Nikte could be compared to a classical Greek myth.  In that a human relative of a god has to take a journey to do a heroic deed.  Nikte is set in the ancient Mesoamerican Olmec culture.  Nikte is a girl who is not content with what her average family has to offer.  She literally stumbles upon some information about a prophecy.  After a comet appears in the sky, Nikte makes her entrance as the ""Celestial Princess"" of the prophesy.  Royal privileges come with a price.  Two priests inform Nikte that as the ""Celestial Princess"" she has to retrieve something hidden somewhere in order to save the town from a looming pestilence.
