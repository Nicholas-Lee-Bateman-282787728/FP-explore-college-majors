8521572,4,B007RZA678,"I bought this DVD because I heard the Meghan Arbogast uses it. So I figured it must be good. To add to the bona fides, McMillan Running is a very well respected coaching enterprise. I like it very much. It's a simple and effective workout, presented in follow-along format.

The video is well produced with good video and sound quality. The coaching is simple and effective. There are good cues as you follow along. This DVD has three workouts, which are basically the same routine, with increased difficulty. The Core 1 workout only takes about 10 minutes, so it's easy to fit in.

I'm happy with the purchase, although I am surprised at the cost. I have seen them on sale at mcmillanrunning.com for less when purchased as a set.",1351123200,11,730,4.607692307692307
