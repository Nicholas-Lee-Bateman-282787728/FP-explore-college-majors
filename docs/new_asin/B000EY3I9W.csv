8115718,5,B000EY3I9W,"Marvin Schwartz is marvelous as the nutcase serial killer,
in a film that is both hair-raising and hilarious.
This is a very low-budget film that proves you don't need to
spend much to delight an audience.",1358208000,,205,4.722222222222222
8115719,5,B000EY3I9W,"Very interesting ""documentary"" about a serial-murdering stand-up comedian. We are taken along as he goes through his routines, both on the stage and while creeping up on his latest victims. Extremely black humour sure to please funny-boned sadists or those w/ a warped sense of hilarity (like me). This low-low-budget, B+W gem is also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...",1258848000,2,379,5.333333333333333
