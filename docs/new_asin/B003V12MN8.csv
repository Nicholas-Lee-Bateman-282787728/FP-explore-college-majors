8406326,4,B003V12MN8,"This version is a bit longer and more involved, with somewhat more nudity. The movie is about shared nightmares which the dreamers discuss in an online forum. The main character, Priya, played by Angela Tropea, is often naked in her dreams and, when worrying about them on her sofa or in bed, she is half-dressed. So, this movie delivers on T&A. Tropea is full-bodied and doesn't look at all like your typical ""nude model"" type. The story is a bit jumbled, shot with a lot of ""scary"" editing and ""creepy"" scenes of rituals involving hanging, smearing blood on people, weird old characters, etc. It seems portentious and interesting but doesn't make much sense. To be honest: I didn't mind.",1342483200,,689,4.798319327731092
