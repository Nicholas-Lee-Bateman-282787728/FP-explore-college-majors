7935649,4,B00005ASOT,"Groes deutsches Kino, wie man es seit der Machtergreifung der Nazis nicht mehr erlebt hat, weil hier nicht nur innovative Techniken gezeigt werden, z. B. eine Kamera aus einem fahrenden Auto, sondern weil man sich hier nicht scheut, direkt zu reden, und Charaktere auch ein wenig an der Wirklichkeit vorbei zu zeichnen, um aber ber die bertreibung an Dramaturgie zu gewinnen, die dann wieder realer wirkt, als es mit einem ""groen Verstndnis"" fr den Einzelnen gelungen wre. Eine freiwillige oder unfreiwillige Zensur aus kommerziellen oder aus Grnden des Mainstreams, der glaubt, sthetische Kategorien vorgeben zu drfen, gibt es hier nicht, P zieht mit all seinen Macken und politischen Naivitt seinen Film durch, auch auf die Gefahr hin, beim Publikum anzuecken. - In der Geschichte stt eine Brgerliche auf die Seiten der Bolschewiken, zeitlich 20 Jahre vor ""Rien ne va plus"" von Sartre, der eine solche Liebe zum Scheitern verurteilt, ist das hier mglich, es gibt nicht das Verbot von utopischen Gedanken und denen, die im Namen der Freiheit ihren Einfluss geltend machen, um jeglichen Reflex von Brderlichkeit zu unterdrcken",1505001600,,1126,5.29608938547486

7935654,5,B00005ASOT,"After the Russian Revolution, Civil war raged in the Crimea, bringing in its wake chaos and misery and unscrupulous men.

It is after the revolution Jeannie and her father are recording the events. Looks like her father is on the losing side when the Red Army arrives. He is dispatched and she is sent to Paris. That is where the story of the revolution ends and good old fashioned mystery begins from the loss of a diamond to even possibly murder.

I always knew that the movie was a classic but other than G. W. Pabst (I have quit a few of his films); I just realized that this was from a novel by Ilja Ehrenburg. Looks like I have some reading to do. And I was surprised to see Brigitte Helm (Metropolis - The Creative Man/The Machine Man/Death/The Seven Deadly Sins/Maria). This film has many facets.",1362614400,3,804,4.462585034013605

7935656,5,B00005ASOT,"First, the important stuff..
sound and image are very good, although the restoration could have been better.
Still, a most satisfying visual and audio experience. I will enjoy watching this movie once a year along with other Pabst movies. I found the pace of the narrative most brisk and it nicely carries you along through the quality sets and visuals. I especially enjoyed the quick, succinct, and suspenseful, train compartment conclusion. I highly recommend this for the libary of all those who enjoy classic silent cinema that has very good visual and audio quality.",1184371200,4,571,5.085106382978723
7935657,5,B00005ASOT,"While not one of German director G.W. Pabst's most famous silent films today, ""The Love of Jeanne Ney"" might well be one of his finest in many respects such as cinematic styles and characters, and the excellent picture quality on this DVD, together with a fitting orchestral score, enhance this film even more.  It is essentially a beautiful love story set in a tumultuous time; first in Russia after the Revolution where French girl, Jeanne Ney, is caught up in the Bolshevik take-over, and then in Paris where her uncle is murdered and her lover framed for the crime.  The story is interesting and often unpredictable, but I was even more impressed by the characters and the way Pabst brought out the best in them, often with some evocative and poignant scenes.  Although Jeanne is the key figure, it is in fact the villain who steals the show, in my opinion, and who better than Fritz Rasp to play the part, with his exquisite talent for depicting the most despicable characters, and with a face you just want to slap.  (He effectively played a similar despised character in a later G.W. Pabst film, ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" starring Louise Brooks)  Another impressive role is by Brigitte Helm, who played Maria in the famous silent classic, ""Metropolis"", and in this film quite brilliantly portrays Jeanne's blind cousin who falls prey to the villainous Fritz Rasp character.  There are quite a few stark and memorable scenes in this film, thanks to Pabst's discerning eye and sense for subtle yet effective and sophisticated drama, making ""The Love of Jeanne Ney"" a particularly satisfying viewing experience.",1156896000,8,1612,4.886446886446887
7935658,5,B00005ASOT,"""The Love of Jeanne Ney"" is a glorious complex love and suspense story that has murder, politics, one loved one responsible for the death of another, and a hateful scoundrel. Jeanne Ney is the daughter of a man stationed in Russia immediately prior to the Bolshevik revolution. Before he can effect their return to Paris, her young lover and a comrade confront him over a list of Bolshevik leaders and her Father is killed in a gunfight. There are many great characters, from the conman who sold the worthless set of names to her Father, to the kindly official who tries to ease her pain after her Father's death, and on to her mercenary uncle and blind cousin in Paris. The cinematography is gorgeous and inventive, the street scenes are magnificently detailed, and the screenplay by Ilya Ehrenberg is outstanding.",997920000,14,815,4.828571428571428
