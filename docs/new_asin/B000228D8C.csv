8072908,2,B000228D8C,"A tale of existential desolation, it has moments but is self-indulgent and scattered.

I bought this because I was impressed by Thom Hoffman in ""Black Book,"" and because Mr. Hoffman could apparently move from a ""brave"" perfomances in films like ""Fourth Man"" to ""ultrabrave"" (soft-core at least) stuff like this to touring the Netherlands as Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady.""",1179619200,,373,5.114754098360656
8072909,3,B000228D8C,"A weird movie to watch. Not a piece you want to see, if you're used to Titanics and Dances with Wolves. Yet: a very melancholy tone runs through the whole film, leaving you dreamy and unpredictable. Which proves interesting, because I am not a person who likes pornography to be 'thrown at her face' as a 'piece of culture'.

Actually: judge for yourself! You won't be disappointed.",1129248000,,382,4.701492537313433
