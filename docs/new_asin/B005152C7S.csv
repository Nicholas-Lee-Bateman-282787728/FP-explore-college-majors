4519512,5,B005152C7S,"Jean Vigo...the man who influenced the French New Wave post-humously.

Jean Vigo...the legendary filmmaker who died of a young age of 29, only directed four films which didn't do well in the box office but yet, is highly regarded by filmmakers and critics.

Jean Vigo...the filmmaker who directed the adaptation of ""L'Atalante"" considered by filmmaker Francis Truffaut as the predecessor of Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless"" and considered by Truffaut as one of his ten best films of all time.

So, who is this man... Jean Vigo?

The filmmaker was the son of a famous, anarchist militant named Miguel Almereyda who died of mysterious circumstances in prison (it is believed that authorities strangled Almereyda during his sleep, while the prison wrote it down as a suicide).

So, Vigo as a young man lived a life full of pain.  Living from one orphanage to the next.  His descendants were afflicted with tuberculosis, his grandmother was institutionalized, his siblings died at a young age and the only thing he had to his name was a photo of his grandfather with the inscription ""I protect the weakest"".

And as a teenager, he fell in love with cinema, established his own film club in Nice and wanted to work in cinema to the point that he wrote to as many companies asking if he can be an assistant.

But when Jean Vigo met his girlfriend and wife (from a good family), his father-in-law gave him the opportunity to make films by giving him a camera and this would begin Jean Vigo's career as an independent filmmaker and lead him to the road of creating his four films "" propos de Nice"" (1930), a commissioned film titled ""Taris"" (1931) and his two films  that he is known for: ""Zero de Conduite"" (1933) and ""L'Atalante"" (1934).

And to celebrate the career of Jean Vigo, the Criterion Collection is releasing ""The Complete Jean Vigo"" on Blu-ray and DVD in Aug. 2011.

The first short featured is a silent film titled "" propos de Nice"", a short documentary that includes real life footage of the rich and the working class via hidden camera in Nice but also staged elements.

Vigo said of "" propos de Nice"" that it is a ""last gap of a society so lost in its escapism that it sickens you and makes you sympathetic to a revolutionary solution"".

Vigo pokes fun at the rich showcasing them with their expensive outfits but also showcasing gag elements such as a man getting a suntan and his face is burned black to the man getting his shoes shined to the point where the shoe is shined to the point of disappearing.

The 1930 film also showcases special effects of the time as Vigo utilizes slow motion to showcase the vibrant dancing girls (which he makes his own brief appearance dancing) to using reverse footage.

The second short is a commissioned film titled ""Tardis"", in which he was hired among other newer filmmakers to create educational film.  In this case, a nine minute film about champion swimmer Jean Tardis teaching people his style of swimming.  Vigo could care less about the character but wanted to experiment with shooting in water and while Vigo was not so fond of the film (as the company brought in another filmmaker to complete it), Vigo's interest in shooting in water would be showcased in his final film ""L'Atalante"".

The final two films featured on the Blu-ray disc are films that Vigo is best known for.

""Zero de Conduite"" is Vigo's 1933 film which many say is a predecessor to films such as Francois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" and Lindsay Anderson's""If..."", while the film can be seen as being inspired by Jean Renoir's ""Tire au Flanc"" (1928) and Charlie Chaplin's ""Shoulder Arms"" (1918).

The film revolves around a group of boys wanting to revolt against the system at their boarding school.  The authority of the school are painted as imbeciles and in terms of the style of the film, ""Zero de Conduite"" can be seen as Vigo's experimental film but also a film that draws from his own experience of attending boarding school and having to endure a repressive educational establishment.  Showing Vigo's maturity, as well as inheriting his father's anarchistic view during his childhood and demonstrating his artistic flair, the use of slow motion, camera angles and a bold storyline for its time showcasing realism and revolt.

An audacious film for its time, ""Zero de Conduite"" was banned by film censors due to its content and would never be released until nearly a decade after his death in 1945.

The final film on the Blu-ray is Vigo's last film and his defining masterpiece is ""L'Atalante"".

Directed while the young filmmaker was sick from tuberculosis (its important to mention that ""Zero de Conduite"", Jean Vigo was also ill and directed scenes wile laying in a cot).  Filmmaker Ingmar Bergman once said ""One must make each film as if it were the last"", perhaps Jean Vigo knew through his illness that if ""L'Atalante"" was to be his last film, you go out with a bang.

A film ahead of its time, ""L'Atalante"" was a failure in the box office, misunderstood by theater owners and the final cut that Vigo made was butchered.  But through restoration and efforts to try to restore the film, it is what the filmmakers of the French New Wave would watch and be inspired by Vigo's work.

Francois Truffaut who first watched the film at the age 14 said in an interview about the film, ""When I entered the theater, I didn't even know who Jean Vigo was. I was immediately overwhelmed with wild enthusiasm for his work.""

VIDEO:

Each of the films presented on ""The Complete Jean Vigo"" Blu-ray release are presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio for "" propos de Nice"" and ""L'Atalante"" while ""Zero de Conduite"" is presented in 1:19:1) and look absolutely fantastic.

First, for the first three films, the condition of these films are in very good condition especially for the 1930 film "" propos de Nice"", a silent film which you would think would have major problems with its overall look, the film actually looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  And this goes for every other film in this release, blacks levels are nice and deep, contrast is fantastic as grays and whites do pop! and for anyone who has watched ""L'Atalante"" and have only seen bad copies of the film, once you watch it on Blu-ray and see how good the film is, fans of this classic will be surprised.

While some of the films have white speckles, by no means are these a distraction.  Trust me on this one, these films look very awesome on Blu-ray, especially considering the condition of the previous video versions I have seen of these films awhile back.

According to the Criterion Collection, these new high-definition digital transfers were created on a Spirit Datacine from the following elements: "" propos de Nice"" and ""Taris"" are from 35 mm fine-grain master positives, ""Zero de Conduite"" is from a 35 mm fine-grain master positive and a 35 mm duplicate negative and L'Atalante from the 2001 Gaumont 35 mm restoration negative.

Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, flicker and instability were manually removed from each film using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Complete Jean Vigo"" is presented in French LPCM monaural.  According to the Criterion Collection, the monaural soundtracks were remastered at 24-bit from 35 mm positive and negative optical soundtracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

For "" propos de Nice"", a score was performed by Marc Perrone in 2001.

For the most part, each of these films feature a clear soundtrack which I detected no noticeable hiss or any problems whatsoever.  Dialogue is clear for ""Zero de Conduite"" and also L'Atalante"".  Once again, this is the best I have heard from these films and fans of Jean Vigo's films should be happy with the overall soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With releases from the Criterion Collection, I tend to be quite grateful for the films they bring out to the US and give special treatment, but there are times when a title comes along and literally puts this big smile on my face throughout the day and just waiting and anticipating its release because I want to watch it so badly.

This is how I feel about ""The Complete Jean Vigo"" Blu-ray release.

And there are not many filmmakers with a short oeuvre that really catch my attention but for Jean Vigo, this is an exception.  Afterall, if you love the work of Eric Rohmer, Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Jim Jarmusch to name a few, these filmmakers were pretty much inspired by Jean Vigo.

Afterall, this filmmaker in the 1930's, not only went against traditional cinema with his poetic, artistic style, he also faced critical attacks from critics and theater owners because his films were not like other films of that time.  You can say that Vigo's films were ahead of its time and to think that with the four films that he worked on, if he lived a long life, one can only imagine the possibilities of the types of cinema that would have been created by him.

I think Francois Truffaut was correct when he compared another French filmmaker of that same era, Jean Renoir, who was a humanist but in Truffaut's words, ""Renoir's heart never bled"".

Vigo was a man who drew from his painful experience and it was that drive that brought him to cinema and to create the films that he did.  From "" propos de Nice"" and showcasing the rich and the poor and also mocking the rich.  And then getting the opportunity to film a champion swimmer in ""Tardis"" but caring less about creating a film about a swimmer giving instructions but to use the time wisely to learn about doing the kind of film he wanted to do, but this time in the water.  While ""Zero de Conduite"" is Vigo's chance to let out his frustration of boarding school through the boys featured in the film.

His artistic expression with the use of reverse film, slow motion and as Truffaut had said of Vigo, the use of two major tendencies of cinema - realism and estheticism.  ""L'Atalante""  has a theme that focuses on the journey of a couple from marriage, their difficulty of trying to adapt to each other and one having to go through love, pain, reconciliation and acceptance.

""L'Atalante"" is a love story first and foremost but its efficacy lies in its realism.  This is no love story that lies within the confine of the typical love story banality.  These are human emotions that anyone can feel but the way its portrayed, as the word Truffaut used ""estheticism"", bringing art to daily life.

The inclusion of the other Vigo films in this Blu-ray release is a way to understand Jean Vigo and how it applies to ""L'Atalante"".

"" propos de Nice"" towards society, as the character of Jean already has some contempt towards city life and that is probably why he is somewhat of an escapist, preferring to live his life in his barge instead of living in the city with his wife.

""Tardis"" as a way for Vigo to reconnect with his passion of filming ala the aquatics and provides one of the most beautiful scenes in ""L'Atalante"" and ""Zero de Conduite"" as a way to showcase Vigo's rebelliousness and to ensure his drive to create anything through non-traditional means.  Sensual scenes where we see both husband and wife, miles apart, dreaming of each other sexually and the way it was filmed was bold yet artistic and poetic.

It's hard to believe that the film was so ill received but at the time, no one dare try anything outside of traditional cinema.  Granted, the Germans were known for their expressionist cinema but even Fritz Lang's 1927 ""Metropolis"" didn't do well in the box office.  But you look at 1934 and romantic films were driven by romantic comedies of MGM's ""The Thin Man"", RKO's ""The Gay Divorcee"" and Columbia's ""It Happened One Night"" which dominated not just America but also international cinema.

""L'Atalante"" was nothing like those films that year.  Fast forward to 2011 and watching ""L'Atalante"" today and I still feel that why this film is still loved was because it is a film that was done the way that Vigo had wanted.  The theaters owners and the movie studio Gaumont obviously didn't feel the same way and butchered the film (and ironically, would many decades later work to restore the film).

But the beauty of Jean Vigo's work is that he remained true to himself, to his work and died at a young age, but yet managing to give everything he had to what possibly saved him from his own destruction.  Cinema provided the outlet, and Jean Vigo used it well, even though he was ill with tuberculosis, which would claim his life at the young age of 29.

""The Complete Jean Vigo"" is a magnificent release.  For many years, cinema fans have wanted this release for America but the only way to watch these films was the 2004 Artificial Eye European release or bad copies that existed in terrible condition.

So, watching these four films on Blu-ray and seeing how great they look in HD, I was ecstatic.  And then to watch them with in-depth commentary bundled with lengthy special features and once again, the Criterion Collection has released a magnificent Blu-ray release.

Criterion Collection fans, those who are curious about this release and of course, the die-hard Jean Vigo fans, ""The Complete Jean Vigo"" is absolutely wonderful and is a must-buy, must-own 5-star release.  Highly recommended!",1323993600,5,14850,4.8005507474429585

With the wonderful documentary A Propos de Nice, that feels like a cross between the filmmaking of Dziga Vertov and Luis Bunuel. Then there is the short but brilliant documentary Taris about the French swimming champion that now seems like the prototype for all sports documentaries. Then there is the film Zero for Conduct, about a rebellion among young males in a private school that seems like a prototype for the Lindsay Anderson film If... Then there is the beautiful L'Atalante about newlyweds beginning their marriage on a canal barge. Truly great filmmaking with touching and heartbreaking sequences that show how masterful Vigo was.

For anyone who has seen the work of Jean Vigo (preferable of film screened in a theater with an engaged audience), I do not need to tell you what a master and early innovator he was. He was a great story teller and his influence has been far reaching to every generation of great directors after him. Even those young directors who don't know his work were influenced by his followers.

4519518,5,B005152C7S,"Sight unseen.... the Blu-ray DVD has not yet been released. I have however seen all of these films, and own l'Atalante on DVD--which improved the quality of this very old movie. In Blu-ray it will probably be further improved, but I cannot speak to that.
For me there is no movie more romantic and heartfelt than L'Atalante. It's story is simple enough, a young couple is married in a small town and then begins married life on Seine River barge heading for Paris. The deck hand is Michel Simon, (Boudu Saved From Drowning -Jean Renoir) in another funny role. They arrive in Paris, complications ensue... L'Atalante inspired the French New Wave, especially Francois Truffaut, Claude Lelouch and Jacques Rivette. It's one of the great treasures.

Zero de Conduite - is about a rebellion in a boarding school and established that genre. Luis Bunuel's Los Olvidados and Truffaut's the 400 Blows, quote directly from it.

A Propos de Nice and Taris are a City Film and a study of a swimming champion. They will seem very dated, but if you love movies, city films-films about cities-are interesting, both historically, and for the film techniques they used. The qualities of these short movies led directly to Vigo being allowed to make his two feature films.

I can't say enough about Jean Vigo and especially L'Atalante and Zero de Conduit.",1306540800,68,1337,4.881057268722467

I couldn't be happier. The prints look clean, almost new. L'Atalante has been restored to its original version. A second disk and booklet provide critical perspective and a wealth of information on the makings of the films and the subsequent reception of the films. Vigo was way ahead of his time and so, of course his films were met with condemnation and scorn. When they were later discovered by a new generation in the 1950's they became the main inspiration for a new esthetic as realized by the Auteurs of the French New Wave. Vigo's films are celebrations of freedom, the sensual and noble grace of the human body, irrepressibly romantic; witty, satirical and playful; yet firmly grounded in real life.

Still, these films seem so fresh, so radical in their content that they could be a documentary filmed today exposing inequalities and asking many difficult questions.

The world, light, people, water, even loss are seen through fresh eyes.  The whole film is suffused with a kind of awe at existence.

4519533,5,B005152C7S,"""The Complete Jean Vigo,"" consists of three short, early silent works of the French filmmaker, ""A propos de Nice,""""Taris,"" and ""Zero de conduite,"" along with ""L'Atalante,"" (1930),thankfully a talkie, a romantic drama that is considered one of the lesser known glories of early French cinema, which is a shame, as it is a masterpiece.

""A propos de Nice"" is a rhythmic view of life in that bustling tourist city; it occasionally rises to unexpected absurd heights.  ""Taris"" is a portrait of a swimming champion.  ""Zero de conduite"" is an inventive, charming tale of rebellious boarding school students, a topic on which Vigo can be presumed to know a lot: It has been endlessly influential to other film makers world wide over the years.

""L'Atalante""is in black and white, runs a tight 89 minutes, and is the greatest achievement of Vigo, a too-little known but greatly respected and influential film maker, who died of tuberculosis, shortly after its completion, at the shockingly young age of 29.  The film is now generally available only on this disk that constitutes the entire oeuvre of the director's short, turbulent life.

Vigo's master work opens as Juliette, a young girl who has never set foot outside her village, marries Jean, mate on a French river barge named ""L'Atalante,"" and sets up housekeeping aboard.  Also aboard are a cabin boy, and the colorful old sailor Pere Jules, played by the inimitable Michel Simon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Port-of-Shadows-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00026L74U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Port of Shadows (The Criterion Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Train/dp/079284047X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Train</a>).  When the barge reaches Paris, Juliette, who has never seen that great city, slips off to take a look at it.  Jean awakes, discovers her gone, and leaves her to her own devices in the French capital.  She knows no one there, has no money, does not know the city at all, and will have a very hard time there.  But so will Jean, on his own again, until Pere Jules goes to find her.

But this simple, engaging plot isn't the reason the film is so loved.  It was restored in 2001, making Boris Kaufman's brilliant cinematography and Maurice Jaubert's lovely score accessible again. The picture is legendary for its sheer, sparkling beauty: the waterways of France, and of Paris - the movie was filmed in that city's ""Bassin de la Villette, Paris 19""-- among other locations, have never looked more evocatively beautiful.  The characters are full-blown, their actions unpredictable, confusing, true to life.  The film is wildly imaginative, inventive, surrealist, and has been compared to the daring early works of Vigo's contemporaries, the better known Jean Cocteau and Luis Bunuel.  It remains fresh today, with scenes that still have the power to surprise and absorb us.

Vigo was the son of Miguel Almareyda, a notorious anarchist, who died mysteriously in jail when Vigo was 12.  The young boy was always in poor health: he was abandoned by his mother and sent from boarding school to boarding school.  Lucky for us, he took up film at age 23. Just because Vigo is little-known today, doesn't mean his work is not accessible.  You want to see what we're all talking about.",1327104000,4,3340,5.3742802303262955

If you enjoy the films of Terry Gilliam, Wes Anderson or Tim Burton you'd do well by yourself to take in the work of Jean Vigo.  It's arguable that he wrote the book that they learned from.  Surreal, full of fantasy moments and equal parts dreamy romanticism and harsh honesty about human nature with an outstanding sense of environment.  To tell you more about the films would be to spoil the discovery for you.  Just sit back, watch them and get used to the dropping of your jaw.",1379635200,3,585,4.481132075471698
8452341,4,B005152C7S,"It is truly amazing what Criterion has done with the main course of this blu ray release which has been massacred by censors and clueless distributors so many times from the very beginning of its release.  I'm talking of course about ""L'Atalante"" which is the jewel in the crown here and is sadly the last work of its director Vigo before his early death from consumption.  When I watched this blu ray release I had the impression I was back in time watching in the old movie theatres where you would get a cartoon or two, a newsreel or two and then the main course.  Here we get the 23 minute silent ""documentary"" of Nice in "" Propos De Nice"" to start us off followed by another 9 minute documentary about a top French swimmer in ""Taris"" and then a comedy of sorts which in the day was actually considered scandalous by the French public in the 44 minute ""Zero de Conduite"" which showed to me the quaint sense of humour of Vigo especially with the midget school principal; the scene where he struggles to put his hat on the ledge where a mirror is strategically placed to give the optical illusion that he was much taller is priceless!  Without any words Vigo tells us exactly the character of the principal and how he sees himself as being more substantial/important than he really is or at least is perceived by everybody else.

While so far we have fairly entertaining fare for me at least ""L'Atalante"" is the masterpiece here.  I have watched it 3 times already and I can't wait to watch it again which to me spells classic film in any language.  I find myself surprised at the way this otherwise very simple story of newly weds embarking both figuratively and literally on their journey of marriage and some of the usual problems that such couples encounter albeit compressed in 87 minutes what in real life takes months or even years is told by Vigo.  His at least to me strange choice of camera angles and framing of shots gave me the distinct impression that he was purposely trying to surprise me at every turn.  It was as if Vigo knew what I was expecting to see and so he deliberately did things differently just to spite me; the result was not anger on my part but pleasant surprise that makes me want to watch this over and over again just to make sure that I actually saw what I thought I saw.

I can count on one hand how many films make me want to watch them over and over again and now I can count ""L'Atalante"" among these.  As mentioned at the start, this film was subject to many indignities being so far ahead of its time that this restored version in blu ray appears to be the best that can currently be done unless someone miraculously discovers a better master print somewhere.  Imperfections abound but not at least for me to be too distracting and I have seen a lot worse such as the very poor treatment by Kino of ""Les Vampires"" for example and so while the picture quality isn't perfect it isn't that bad either.  The sound quality is also quite good and as is usually the case with the magnificent Criterion the special features are indeed special with great documentaries and interviews about the film.

This is the first time I've seen Michel Simon and his performance as Pere Jules must rank among the greatest acting of all time and for me ranks as highly as Walter Huston's in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre""; it is that good.  It is his character that becomes the unlikely hero throughout the film that suggests whether they like it or not the youth still depend upon the experience of their elders to get them through.  This is a highly enjoyable film that deserves to be in any film buff's video library and although not perfect is still a very worthy Criterion blu ray release.

Highly recommended!",1374451200,8,3739,4.466960352422907
