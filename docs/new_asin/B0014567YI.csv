Who needs a story when you got non stop gunshot wounds, impaling, decapitations, eviscerations and even fetal stomping! This film is just plain old fun.

German underground splatter films is just that, German Underground Splatter.

Wow.

I have seen a lot of REALLY bad movies over the years, but this is truly in a class of its own.  To call it a ""film"" would be inaccurate.  There is no plot.  It seems to have been shot in a single take on a VHS camera using recycled tapes, as I've seen far better resolution from cheapo camera phones.  The ""blood"" isn't even red -- it looks like coffee, either being splashed from a cup or squirted out of a tube.  The ""intestines"" hanging out of an abdomenal wound appear to be constructed from blue sweatpants.  The makeup f/x seem to have been handled by autistic jr high students with ADD . . . either that, or they just didn't care.  Oh, and the story sucked too.  Some nonsense about, ""Your uncle was killed by a drunk driver, and if you join our gang we'll kill the drunk's whole family for you.""

I struggled to endure this ""film"" until about 5 minutes into the first fight, where the fellow who just received serious gunshot wounds through both thighs proceeded to chase the shooter around and kick him -- then the gun was taken away and he shot the shooter -- whereupon the shooter pops open the hatchback of his car and pulls out a small chainsaw (already running) to counterattack -- and his victim then proceeds to grasp the bar of said chainsaw (as well as the sharp spinning chain) with both hands, sustaining not so much as a papercut . . . after watching a few more minutes of this stupidity I realized that I couldn't even fast forward through the remaining 90% of the ""film"", so I instead pressed the ""chapter advance"" button repeatedly and saw that it was pretty much the same throughout.

To add insult to injury, the perpetrator of this cinematic dog dropping actually had the audacity to add ""Special Features"" to the disc, in which he pontificates about his vision and philosophy . . . for which he should be beaten with a large stick . . . even though there were no subtitles for the Special Features and I can't understand German.  I see this ""film"" was released in 1999, and I wonder at which fast food franchise the Writer/Director now toils?

This is the Worst Movie Ever Made.  And it isn't even funny.  I skipped through most of it AND got a full refund, yet I still feel as if I've been wronged.  I would rather get kicked in the groin repeatedly than be forced to watch this ""film"" in its entirety.  Beyond awful.",1208736000,3,2618,4.295315682281059

8254475,4,B0014567YI,"First off, if you pop this film in your DVD player expecting to see a film that will explain the meaning of life, go elsewhere, because you won't get that here. What you will get is an insane plot filled with all kinds of inconsistencies, wild gore effects including a super glue head surgery/brain transplant, and if anything else, a fun time. And why else watch something like this for any other reason but to have fun? In the vein of Olaf Ittenbach and Andreas Schnaas, Heiko Fipper gives us an overlooked German gorefest with all the craziness you would expect from the underground.",1507075200,,586,4.644230769230769
8254476,3,B0014567YI,"The no-budget amateur chaos that reigns in Das Komabrutale Duell is of a kind that suspension of disbelief must be constantly employed. In addition, all rules about what ""good filmmaking"" or even ""good horror filmmaking"" are must be thrown out the window in favor of total anarchic energy. But once that is done, this movie lives up to expectations and delivers with a completely over-the-top bacchanale of violence, horror, gore and back-and-forth revenge for its full running time.

There is so much bloodshed in this movie that some look at it as one of the most violent of its kind anywhere on earth. Others will say that they see it as a budgetless joke. Still others might call it an ingenious satire. But most everyone will have an opinion and few will be ""blah"" about it, and that is the sure sign of a movie doing something different - regardless of what it is!

With the backdrop of warm-weather public parks in Germany as their only ""sets"" for the most part, the filmmakers nonetheless deliver a seemingly endless chronicle of vengeance and violence as the participants rage back and forth at each other with hand to hand combat, guns, ""chain saws"" and arterial sprays of blood in a bid to be the ones who will at last come out on top.

Along the way there is plenty of cheap ""scary"" music, nice no-budget scenery and entertainingly bad acting, so much so that it is all compelling somehow, and certainly interesting at least in my oddball estimation.

The ""special effects"" here are sometimes ridiculous, but they are always excessive, and they seem to be making a comment on both the absurdity and the maudlin, repetitive nature of violence, whether the filmmakers intended this or not!

The film also has its own original atmosphere, its own special weirdness, something that big-budget Hollywood productions can rarely claim. An absolute must-see for low-budget gore afficianadoes!",1490486400,,1896,4.894080996884735

8254479,1,B0014567YI,"Okay, I am sorry to say this, but it is time for an intervention, people. Someone has to travel to the heartland of Westphalia or Niedersachsen or wherever, and sit down Heiko Fipper and tell him that neither he nor his friends are allowed to make movies anymore. Seriously, this is just a step up from public onanism. 'Nuff said.",1402358400,,330,4.516666666666667
8254480,4,B0014567YI,"Silly. Outrageous. A tale of revenge. A man, Heiko (played by the director) hits another man while drunk driving. Stefan, the deceased's son, vows revenge and hires the Eightlets Mafia (Mexican octuplets) to kill Heiko and his family. His parents are slaughtered and Heiko beaten so senseless he's left in a coma. Upon awakening, he meanders about almost as if nothing happened...until he is attacked again, this time by Stefan personally, and the coma-brutal duel begins, involving Heiko's two brothers and the Eightlets Mafia.

The plot is thin. The filmmaking, garbage. The splatter levels high. The entertainment through the roof.

Heiko Fipper is one of those ""one man band"" directors. Here he handles the scripting, lighting, directing, effects, music, sound, and a whole assortment of other duties in addition to being co-star. His craft isn't exactly refined (unlike Shinya Tsukamoto when he made ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man""), but it's good enough to create an enticing thrill ride, and aspects that stand out are the low-key music and insane gore effects, the latter of which being where the movie really shines.

Violence in ""Das komabrutale Duell"" is off the wall. Practically nobody dies, though when they do it takes a barrage of attacks (fists, cars, chainsaws, drills, bullet wounds, split craniums, crucifixions, faces ripped off, etc.) to get them there. The characters are superhumans. There's a glorious amount of bloodshed and gore, and the players just keep coming back for more--thanks in part to sewing up gaping wounds and various revival techniques, one involving injecting mass amounts of blood from others (with no concern over blood type or where the blood travels through the body; ""injecting"" isn't exactly the right word, as they both drink and pour the blood back into large holes in their arms). There's an extremely cartoony, comic bookish quality to the action, violence, and humor in this flick, and from watching the outtakes during the end credits, you can tell that all involved were having a fun time bringing it all together.

One of the highlights in the film is when two brothers take their dead brother to a ramshackle operating room in somebody's attic, where they figure their brother needs a new brain to resurrect him. His head was completely blown out, you see. But one of the brothers says there's no time to fetch someone else's brain and volunteers half of his own. Heiko rips off his brother's head at his request and proceeds to saw the skull in two. Half the brain is applied to his other brother's head (an empty bowl of blood soup) which is then put back together using a hot glue gun. Both brothers function fine each with half of one man's brain and behave no differently than before. Inspired storytelling.

If you're a gorehound and someone into absurd humor and bottom-of-the-barrel budget filmmaking, this one is not to be missed. The bloodshed and gore is near endless, and while not as fun and varied and skilled as something like ""Dead Alive"", there's much enjoyment to be had. And just remember: if you ever get a large bullet wound to your cock and balls, just staple the skin together and you'll be OK.",1340236800,,3166,4.932457786116323
8254481,5,B0014567YI,"Any of you supposed gorehounds hungry for a ridiculous serving of mayhem, filth, chaos, destruction, and insurmountable violence and human suffering? Do you crave an abundance of horrific flesh rippage and eviscerations and decapitations spiked with non stop brutality? Well you sickos better grab a bib and pull up a chair. This is some underground German gourmet! Thrown down your vulnerable little throats, low-budget horror at its absolute most vile. You better have a strong stomach to handle this non-stop barrage of nastiness. This is just flatout awesome. Dig in!

Okay, fair warning...the story here barely serves as a tablecloth. The characters barely make for an appetizer. No pretty cinematography to set the mood, no CGI to amuse the children, no clever writing to stimulate your mind...heck the budget is so low it can't come close to covering the tab. BUT!...I just don't give a darn. This is seriously one of the GREATEST FLICKS EVER MADE. Yep, I said it. I totally love this flick. Watched it three times this Halloween season.

It's a revenge flick like you've never seen. The Eightlets Mafia have a vendetta and will seriously jack some people up. Pain and misery will be dished out in spades. Only problem is...the victims won't freaking stay dead!?!?!?!? They are invincible? WTH!?!? Chainsaw to the face, skull fractureage, bullets buried in the temple...their victims just keep coming back! No clever explanation here, that's just the way it is. Deal with it.

Some people will understandably hate the cheap effects. Some of the deaths look horribly fake, I admit. When one head gets chopped off, I honestly thought the effort could have easily been better to make it look more authentic. But some of the murder shots look very good imo. Plus they are all super bloody!!! Granted sometimes the blood looks like coffee for some strange reason. But it's flowing heavy and frequently. Plus seriously, the best thing about this movie is THE ACTION NEVER STOPS!!! Fighting fighting fighting yes yes yes!! The blood flows constantly. Its crazy stupid brutal, I love it.

One example of the awesomeness--A guy gets both legs shot but can still stand up and fight. Then he gets a chainsaw to his neck with blood flying everywhere--but strangely he can grab the razor sharp vibrating blade as it shreds him apart and his hands don't even get a scratch?!? Go figure.

Need more details? We get a severed arm reattached with a nailgun. Bowling ball sized holes blown in peoples faces. Twin babies ripped from the womb and stomped on. A bucket of blood brought out to the battlefield so the wounded can get a homemade transfusion. Slicing, dicing, hacking, punching, blasting...plenty of gooey bloody insanity, just so freaking amazing it should be illegal. In fact, is is. Banned in Germany, deemed unfit for domestic viewing. Can you handle it?

Seriously, I'd rather watch this than SPLICE or H2 remake or plenty of other Hollywood ""hits"". I found this more entertaining than the Vomit Gore trilogy as well, although I did like those also. That's just me though, obviously this isn't for everyone. Bravo to Heiko Fipper, the writer, director, producer, and actor plus eveyone involved. I watched the special features, and they all had alot of fun making this movie.

If Death was a sport, this flick is batting a thousand! Step up and take a swing.",1320278400,2,3362,4.939823008849557
8254482,1,B0014567YI,"Das Komabrutale Duell is a homemade movie about killing.  That's it.

From the intro on, it's a steady barrage of ultra-violence.  I'd normally find this endearingly entertaining, but the effort became recycled by about the half-way point.  Chance encounter, fight, gunshots, punch-kick-punch, spraying blood, screaming, cut scene to butcher room in house, spraying blood, screaming, more spraying blood, rinse, repeat.  I had a good time watching the crew's blooming ingenuity under obvious budgetary constraints, but then realized said ingenuity was producing the same results over and over and over again for a LONG time.  With the exception of some unique kill-scenes peppered randomly throughout the film, this was as repetitive as a car alarm in the middle of the night.

Oh, and the blood is brown like diarrhea.  Copious amounts of spraying diarrhea.

Seems to me this would be a great shock-movie to put on a repeat during a Halloween warehouse party, maybe?  Either way, the only way I'd recommend ordering this was if you were being paid to own it.  Free is too expensive.

8254483,5,B0014567YI,"I am inclined to agree with Mr Biro's previous comments on this title. I mean come on guys, what they hell did you expect from a film made with pocket money, shot on a digital camcorder, made by gore fans in Germany?
I hate the way people put down movies like this. At least the filmmakers had the balls to go out and make it, rather than sit around bitching about how crap no-budget movies are.
I expected very little from Das Komabrutale Duell and ended up loving every second of its outageous insanity. Two thumbs up to Mr Biro's Unearthed Films for making this look as good as it ever will. Sure its a camcorder flick but it looks excellent on DVD considering its humble origins. Keep up the good work Unearthed...how about seeing those Violent Sh** movies or unearthing something like David Blyth's gory Death Warmed Up (uncut version only of course).

If, however, you are looking for something that is filled with outrageous scenes of ridiculous bloodletting, over the top gore set pieces, and no moral point, than this is for you.
