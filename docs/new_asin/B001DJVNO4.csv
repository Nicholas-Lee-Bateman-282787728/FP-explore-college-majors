8293862,4,B001DJVNO4,"Great performance, well recorded audio and video from an extremely underrated lineup. As other reviewers have said you get it all: Ozzy/Dio/Martin-era songs (and if you don't know those you are missing out). This is a great show, it seems like a complete performance from an under documented Sabbath lineup with plenty of Iommi guitar - stretching out on certain songs. The audio is mono (- one star for that) but video quality is excellent. The mono audio does not detract from the performance experience - so this one's a keeper! Tony Martin does a great job here! The band is energized and Iommi actually smiles...this maybe an unofficial release but it is professionally done.",1331769600,,680,4.921739130434783
8293863,5,B001DJVNO4,"If you are a fan of the Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath you'll love this DVD, It was recorded in Moscow on the Headless Cross tour in 1989, It was professionally done and as good a quality as the Cross Purposes Live VHS tape in 1994..
