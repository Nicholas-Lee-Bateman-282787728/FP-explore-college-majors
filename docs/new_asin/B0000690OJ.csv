7965280,1,B0000690OJ,"I would like to say that this video didn't help me in any way and I didn't find it very informative.

First, I am not of diminuative size, so that didn't help. Dorf should really focus on the average size player.

Second, this video taught me nothing of the rules of the game, I STILL slice the ball...

All in all, what I HAVE learned from this video is: Dorf knows S%*T about golf...",1129507200,,385,4.175675675675675
7965281,1,B0000690OJ,"My husband and I both love Tim Conway and always laughed at his antics on the Carol Burnett Show.  Since my husband loves to golf, I ordered this DVD for his birthday and we eagerly awaited its arrival, sat down with birthday cake and played it.  WHAT a disappointment!  It is simply NOT funny, very predictable and other than the sight gag of Dorf's short legs, the usual Conway brand of madness is totally missing here.  Save your money.  It is not a very long DVD but seemed long as we kept hoping it would be over.  A disappointing birthday gift to be sure.",1052697600,9,561,4.346153846153846
