6388953,5,B00JPWZYQE,"If you are familiar with bad taste films and revenge flicks you can say you've seen just about everything. From my point of view though this also means you don't mind seeing some of it again. Though Time to Kill may not be everyone's choice if you are looking for a thick plot that keeps you in mystery and suspense, the movie packs a pretty good punch for being a low-budget indie film.  It won't take you long to learn that this movie is clearly a director's love-affair with the grindhouse/exploitation/nudie cutie era of film but from the perspective of someone who probably frequently enjoys Beavis and Butthead and writes their own music.  What is most remarkable about Time to Kill is the editing and cinematography.  For an independent feature, it's really impressive how well it turned out.  Everything flows very well and with so many nice looking women and funny things happening throughout the film, I think most people will want to have this in their collection just to pop in at a party or get together with your friends.

Actress Ellie Church who plays Sarah is the films main focus and it's no mystery why.  She is certainly eye candy and her acting is at times intense but also controlled.  Debbie Rochon makes an appearance in this film and her presence will most definitely be felt by fans of hers.  I think the two actors in this film that really shined through it for me though was Charlie Moon (Lailah) and Jason Hignite (playing himself).  With a story at times that seems to glamorize the sins of life, it's nice to have that character in the story to remind you of the innocence that still needs corrupted out there.  I sure hope to see Charlie Moon in more films because she really made this one for me.  Jason Hignite was the perfect devil.  He had the intensity of Donald Pleasence and the stride of Gene Simmons.

After purchasing this disc, I was pleased to see all the extra's on the disc.  And I'll tell you, it's hard to press play because the opening screen is so tantalizing and mesmerizing.  Cheers to Mostly Harmless Pictures for making this film and packing the dvd full of goodness!",1400630400,,2121,4.588859416445623
6388954,5,B00JPWZYQE,"I bought this directly from the filmmaker and I wasn't disappointed. Plenty of nudity and gore, not to mention attractive women. It's very well done for independent cinema. It's grindhouse the way grindhouse is supposed to be done. Add Brian Williams to the list of directors to keep an eye on. It may not be for everyone, but if you are the type that enjoys bloody, nude fun, then don't hesitate to pick this one up.",1400544000,,417,4.5
6388955,5,B00JPWZYQE,"This excursion in do it yourself grindhouse horror, the first feature length flick from Mostly Harmless Pictures, is ultra low budget PERFECTION! Boobs, Blood, Boobs, Random Lesbianism, Revenge!!....This film screams true labor of love from the kick ass soundtrack, to the brilliant cast of pin up worthy actresses, and the perfectly cast devil...This movie is an absolute BLAST!! I predict awesome things from this studio and with this film, they prove their hearts are in it for the right reasons!",1400544000,,499,5.25
8653176,2,B00JPWZYQE,"I guess if you like that fake hipster-esque wannabe Grindhouse thing you may like it, but this is barely a movie.  Two girls kill a guy, then strip, then go to a strip club where we see strippers, then one gets a ten minute long lap dance with a stripper, then the other girl kills a bunch of strippers for some reason.

Again, it's barely a movie.  It's hardly an hour long.  Completely pointless, steep in fakeout psychotronic trappings but it all seems to just be empty garbage, like the director, as a lot of these dudes do, worship 70s movies and want to emulate them but have nothing to add.

I guess it was shot well enough, and the lead actress is good.  So I'll give it two stars for that...it's poitnless and stinks, but I've seen worse, I guess.  It had one good scene where the lead and her friend both strip (of course) and take a bath.  So that was good.",1440201600,,868,4.25
8653177,5,B00JPWZYQE,Fun and entertaining. Also pretty hilarious,1415750400,,43,6.333333333333333
8653178,5,B00JPWZYQE,"Bought this directly from the filmmaker. This is everything that Hollywood horror isn't. That meaning it's not a regurgitated story/plot, it's not pandering to a PG 13 or R rating, and it's proving why indie horror is necessary. This has everything you want in a film, nudity, gore, humor, violence. Quit reading reviews and just buy it already.",1414540800,,345,4.9655172413793105
8653179,5,B00JPWZYQE,Awesome movie!,1414540800,,14,6.5
8653180,5,B00JPWZYQE,"Sleazily the best Grindhouse inspired Independent film of all time! The Characters are well developed and the editing is flawless. Fun to watch alone but WAY better with a few friends and a few hundred drinks. If you love, blood, boobs and puns, this is a must see film!",1409011200,,270,4.530612244897959
8653181,5,B00JPWZYQE,"A grindhouse type flick that stays true to that vein- meaning hot chicks, nudity, more chicks, blood, murder, more nudity... Basically it rocks!",1406073600,,144,5.304347826086956

8653183,5,B00JPWZYQE,"The best independent movie that I've ever seen. From the boobs, booze, and blood it WILL NOT disappoint. I bought this in the collectors VHS, The DVD, and have seen it screened numerous times. Simply put it never gets old!",1405555200,,222,4.575
8653184,5,B00JPWZYQE,This movie kicks serious ass!! Hands down the best independent film Ive picked up this year! This movie has it all!!!,1401408000,,117,4.619047619047619
8653185,5,B00JPWZYQE,"The tagline on the back pretty much sums it up.  This movie is my favorite of 2014.  It has all the bloody action of a good revenge film interspersed with some amazingly hot sex scenes.  This film successfully emulates a 70s grindhouse film from its grainy look to the fantastic soundtrack.  Last but not least, it is important to point out that the movie is absolutely hilarious.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",1401408000,,449,4.620253164556962
