Very disappointed.",1377907200,,135,4.913043478260869
8195384,1,B000QCLV2I,"This item is very disappointing.  First of all the project sweater is for children, sizes 4-6.  The instructions simply state if you want to make the sweater for an adult use larger needles. I did not find anything about the knitting lesson helpful. This product is useless and I would not recommend that anyone purchase it. The DVD that I received was sticky and has a label on it that reads ""Carroll County Public Library."" Needless to say I am returning this product asap.",1288051200,,475,4.642857142857143

I didn't have any reviews to go by when I bought this, and I wish I'd waited, but then that would have been someone else's tough luck.

I'm posting this review on ALL of the disc sites I can find.

I ordered the set of 5 videos and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!

First, each DVD contains MAYBE one hour of instruction, so these could have all been put on one video & been a much better deal.
Secondly, altho the teaching is fair, this doesn't teach anything you couldn't learn yourself from a product called ""I Taught Myself How to Knit!"", which comes with needles & the basic necessities you need to start knitting.
The Fair Isle DVD doesn't actually teach you two-handed Fair Isle color knitting, which is what I really wanted to learn. It teaches you how to knit right-handed with two colors, laying one down & picking the other up - THIS IS NOT 2-HANDED KNITTING!

All in all, I'm very disappointed in the set of DVDs; I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, unless you find a used set of all 5 DVDs (probably mine!), here or at a garage sale; and I wouldn't recommend you spend more than $5 for all of them.",1236211200,6,1163,4.296803652968037
