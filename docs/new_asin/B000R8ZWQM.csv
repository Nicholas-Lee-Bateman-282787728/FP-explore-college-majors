8199548,5,B000R8ZWQM,The graphics are dated but Mr. Christensen clearly knows his stuff.  I had bought his book first and wanted the videos for additional information.  I highly recommend it!!!,1432512000,,172,5.107142857142857
8199549,5,B000R8ZWQM,"Christensen carefully explains the subtleties of each technique he presents.  He's a nice guy with a sense of humor.  Watching the videos is relaxing and easy.  A must for professionals, and a good addition for the average person interested in self defense, who must also learn more violent techniques - and know how to choose the appropriate moves for the situation which presents itself.",1353369600,,389,5.046875
8199550,5,B000R8ZWQM,"When I first saw the price tag, I groaned inwardly; I was afraid that Paladin Press was going to start gouging its customers the way other companies do when it comes to books and videos on rare info. However, I was able to justify it like this: Paladin seems to charge according to value, and the videos of lesser quality have consequently lower price tags.
  Well, I say that ""R & C Strategies"" fits into the Self-Offense"" category: worth it. Let me tell you why.
  The video set already assumes a base level of knowledge in police tactics like the armbar, centerlock, etc., but where it really shines is how Loren shows you how to take them and actually make them work. Not just with the kind of ""ho-hum, we're in the dojo and you're being a good uke"" sense,"" but in the ""Here's a 300-lb crackhead who's been looking for a cop to eat ever since his parole from penitentiary"" sense.
  How to do the technique in an attack. As such, it is truly useful in comparison to other ""joint-lock"" videos you might've seen, where you just know that the way they're being done simply won't work. The real highlight was that he showed you how to transition into a cuffing position without giving up the pain from every technique, which is especially helpful. This
is all in tape 1.
  Tape 2 builds on the knowledge already presented and shows you some basic principles on how to make alternate techniques work when the armbar, wrist twist, etc. gets [messed] up somehow. I wish he'd spent a little more time on those sections, but my favorite was the lengthy section on pressure point
control. I didn't know much about it, figuring it was that kind of mystical kung-fu stuff that Dillman made popular.
  Loren Christensen prefaces the whole section by telling you why it might and why it might not work, and then proceeds to show where the points are.
They're definitely not things you'll find in a real violent struggle, but when you need to control someone, Loren's info is dead-on.
  My partners and I tried 'em out, and some hurt like the dickens. Just imagine taking an ASP point behind the ear. Brr. I give Loren's uke credit for taking all that abuse. Loren also covers things like proper striking,hair grabs, and getting the subject into a good handcuffing position.
  Lengthy review sections definitely helped to reinforce the material, as did the slow-motion photography and overhead camera angles. It's clear that they put a lot of work into the production, and it shows in every aspect.
  I think Paladin wanted to produce a police tactics video that you could watch over and over again and get something new from each time, and they succeeded.",1018828800,16,2644,4.641630901287554
