8746472,5,B01A590FDC,"A great dramatic re-enactment movie, historically accurate and thus quite shocking at times.  So many wonderful actors in key roles!  Glad to see what was happening in those critical times.  Honest to the limits, if there are any in true history.  English subtitles are fast, so using PAUSE is very important.",1454371200,6,309,5.0
