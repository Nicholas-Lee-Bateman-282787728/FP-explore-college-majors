8270399,5,B0018OU7SW,"This is a great video for learning bluegrass harmony singing. It demonstrated and explained clearly and gave great practice exercises. We loved it. Very practical if you are beginning bluegrass harmony singing. I would have liked her to demonstrate on traditional bluegrass songs, rather than her own songs. Her songs are beautiful, though and the teaching is great. You can rent it for $2 through Vimeo.",1436054400,,404,5.136363636363637
8270400,5,B0018OU7SW,"Bluegrass harmony is ""close"" harmony (closest harmony notes above and below the melody). Jenny's video is an excellent and easy to use method for developing your ability to sing bluegrass harmony. There are two slow songs that are re-played many times where Jenny sings the melody, then demonstrates how to find the harmony notes. She has two helpers that demonstrate each harmony part on individually so you can hear it, then they repeat it several times so you can sing along. Jenny then sings the songs with just the one harmony part so you can sing along or sing the ""missing"" part, then she sings it solo so you can practice both harmony parts. A great way to develop your ear for harmony. In addition, Jenny gives some great tips. A must-have for any serious student of bluegrass vocals.",1383436800,3,793,4.712230215827338
