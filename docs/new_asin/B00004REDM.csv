7920983,5,B00004REDM,The process was impressive. The cost of the rare product was a bargain and the item was received earlier than expected. What's there not to like?,1303862400,,145,4.615384615384615

7920985,5,B00004REDM,"Johnny really brings home the basics to every golfer. We all need a tune up once in a while and I enjoy this video more than most of the ones I own. He's a good person that explains what it takes to hit good shots. I especially enjoyed the slow motion high speed film of his swing. Like he says ""all that matters is impact"". I watch it over and over.",1227312000,,350,3.943661971830986
7920986,5,B00004REDM,"I agree with Mike above in that the content of this video had a huge impact on my going from a 12 to a 2 handicap over the last two years. Each time I watch it I feel more connection with what I am feeling in my golf swing and the feelings that Johnny does such a good job of explaining on the video. I believe learning golf is more than trying to get into specific positions - it's learning the ""feel"" of a good golf swing. Johnny helped me understand what it should feel like and as a result, much of my swing mechanics are just a natural reaction to this feeling. I know that it may sound korny but if you're a 12 now then I can tell you that this is probably what you have to do to be a 2 someday - you must understand the relationship between the (path and clubface angles) and the resulting ball flight and then you have to learn what it feels like to hit a variety of different shots. This is exactly what Johnny covers in the video. I also highly recommend that you check out his other video, ""tricks of the trade"".",1197244800,,1023,4.044334975369458
7920987,5,B00004REDM,"This with One ""Move to Better Golf"" are the best videos I have and I have many.  The part about what to do at impact you won't find anywhere else.",1171324800,3,146,3.8666666666666667
7920988,5,B00004REDM,"This video has made a huge impact on my game.  I went from a 12 to a 4 handicap in about a year, due in no small part to the information on this tape. And this is after having at least 30 lessons from golf pros over the last 16 years. Johnny says ""I'm telling you things that haven't been discussed before"", and it's true.  His explanation of what happens in the hitting area is especially useful.  He goes to great length to explain ""covering the ball"", or the ""heavy hit"", describing exactly the movements one has to perform to properly strike a golf ball.  That being said, this is not a tape for beginners IMO.
  I've also been using the Momentus weighted golf club, and the combination of Johnny's tape and that club can put you on the path to swinging like the pros.",1018396800,14,772,4.289655172413793
