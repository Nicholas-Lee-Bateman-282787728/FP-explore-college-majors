7825518,5,6302427320,"I have been working out with Margaret Richard since the early 90s, and as a result, am still in great shape.  If you sit on the couch and watch, her moves look deceptively simple, but if you jump in there and join in, you will find the moves incredibly challenging and effective.  One thing I really appreciate as I get older is that Margaret will never hurt you.  She designs the workouts to protect your joints, while still offering a challenge.  I hope to still be doing these videos in another 20 years.",1279670400,5,507,4.419354838709677
7825519,5,6302427320,"This is an excellent 5-part workout.  I have owned this VHS since 1992, and I keep coming back to it to stay in shape.  I know there are a lot of new excercise videos, but this one is really fun, and it targets every area women want to target.  I especially like the arm work.",1165881600,14,276,3.981818181818182
