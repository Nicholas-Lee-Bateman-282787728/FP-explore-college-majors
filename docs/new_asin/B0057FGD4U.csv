8460624,1,B0057FGD4U,"This movie is horrible. The acting and writing are horrible and the plot seems very scattered. I wonder how much these people are paid to be in movies like this or do they volunteer, or perhaps they have to pay for screen time. It seems like an extended  acting school or community college movie. I take that back I have seen better community college production than this. The lead actor and actress are horrible, maybe they should try a reality show, or music video their acting is perfect for those formats.",1358985600,,509,4.593406593406593
8460625,1,B0057FGD4U,"This movie was terrible. I forced myself to watch the entire thing only b/c I didn't want to waste a rental. Robin Givens was in it for about 10, as was Miguel. The male/female that played the two leading roles SUCKED. They should both win awards for the worst acting ever. The entire movie was about ""Thea"" trying to hide the fact that she had planned to propose to her boyfriend.
I am a movie fanatic (watch at least 2 or 3 per week) and this ranks in the top 5 on my bad movie list.",1331856000,,485,4.0625
8460626,1,B0057FGD4U,"terrible movie,robin givens barely appears. bad acting, terrible dialouge, not a play as advertised, instead a very, very, low budget film.",1327881600,,139,5.666666666666667
8460627,1,B0057FGD4U,"I just bought this piece of trash today and already I am looking for some poor sucker to pass it off to. I agree with the other reviewer, the DVD cover of this movie was very deceptive. I am a fan of Robin Givens and THAT is the ONLY reason I picked this movie up. Had I known she was BARELY in it, I wouldn't have bought it. How did this movie get made? How did it end up in my reputable video store? These people can't act for crap. I've seen my three-year-old niece give a better performance. I did not laugh once. That is not an exaggeration, people. I feel so ashamed for buying this crap. Why, Robin, did you EVER see fit to star in this hot mess? I am so angry at myself. In this recession my hard earned bucks could have been put to better use. Robin, a bit of advice, call Tyler Perry up and do some other movie. Don't do this foolishness again. You're killing your career.",1318636800,6,882,4.074712643678161
8460628,2,B0057FGD4U,"First of all, the movie started off deceptive because Robin Givens & Miguel Nunez are on the cover, which leads the viewers to believe those are the lead actors when they are not, they actually had small roles in the movie.  The lead actors are ""2"" unknowns named Tigra Guthright & Trell Woodberry who cannot act. Bobby Valentino also appeared in the movie and he did a decent job of acting, definitely better than the ""2"" leads and that's a damn shame.  The man who played the grandfather and the male friend at the BBQ with the hazel eyes did an okay acting job, but the acting of the other extras, the ex-boyfriend who was the health care worker and the friend of Tigra who looked like Beyonce was very amateurish at times.  They pulled off some good lines a few times but overall they were a mess.  Tigra sometimes seemed as though she was acting in a school play and reading her lines from cue cards, and Trell was overly dramatic with his facial expressions and some of his lines, and he seemed as if he was reading cue cards also instead of speaking freely & naturally.  What was ridiculous and not funny at all and actually considered more buffoonery than funny was the singing telegram man who was a white, fat man with a gray raggedy mustache & beard, wearing a pink tutu. WTH?  Who would request such a mess when proposing to someone, especially a female proposing to a man because no man wants to see that?  Do better people.",1317600000,10,1437,4.44106463878327
8460629,5,B0057FGD4U,"Funny and such a cute story line! Great acting by all and especially by Tiara Gathright who plays the lead role.
