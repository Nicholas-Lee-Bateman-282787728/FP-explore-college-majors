7788485,5,0764000446,"This great video showcases some of Gilda Radner's greatest moments during her time on ""Saturday Night Live"".  There are two great rants with Roseanne Roseannadanna (`The Fish Diet' and `Breast Feeding & Bo Derek'), Lisa Loopner's prom night and the very clever `La Dolce Gilda' skit.  There's also the hilarious send-up of ""Dancing in the Dark"" with Steve Martin,  and two of Emily Litella's mixed-up editorials.

One of my personal favourites is the commercial for Patty Caldwell's ""Stretch-Marks"" album (with such numbers as ""Vantage Blues"", ""My Songs are My Children"" and ""My Niece is Such a Drag"").  The `Jewess Jeans' commercial is cute too.  Also hilarious is the impressionable girl on the ""Aunt Jane Creeley's Vegetable  Soup"" commercial.  And let's not forget Radner's masterpiece, the ""Lucy's A-Bomb"" skit.

There are also appearances from her fellow SNL-ers:  Bill Murray, Madeline Kahn, Chevy Chase and Jane Curtin.

A talent taken from us too soon.  Gilda Radner, wherever you are, thanks for the laughter.",1115683200,10,1019,5.260869565217392
