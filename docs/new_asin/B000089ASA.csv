8213169,5,B000089ASA,"Let me immediately say that today I have again watched the ballet DON QUIXOTE in this super-emotional 2002 production of the Opra National de Paris  also to forget what I saw last night with the recent production of DON QUIXOTE from the Wiener Staatsoper where even the stage floor with all those little white pieces seemed dirtied by waste garbage  but, BUT here its a total joy, from the beginning to the end, with sets, costumes & lighting that are very nice, just comme il faut, the corps de ballet that seems as it had done anything else in all their life but dance this Minkus ballet with love and perfection. All enacts sympathy, fun and beauty. . Les toiles are all adorable and la Dupont and Legris make an extra formidable pair - body and soul translated into superb dance and poetry. A real merry party where every second is a joy thanks to artists that have given their love to the profession they live. Thanks to all of them",1525737600,,937,4.473684210526316
