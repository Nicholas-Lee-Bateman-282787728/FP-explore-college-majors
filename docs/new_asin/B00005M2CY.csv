1623925,2,B00005M2CY,"Dated disaster flick with stereotypes for characters. As usual, villain has his own agenda. Didn't care if the stranded people got rescued or not. Found them all whiney or annoying.",1436832000,,181,5.066666666666666
1623926,3,B00005M2CY,"DAYBREAK has it's heart in the right place, and Ted McGinley (Happy Days, Married with Children) is always fun, as he belies his leading man looks and brawn with a childish innocence and awkward macho.  However, looking at this movie on the whole:
*Roy Scheider has succumbed to playing roles that require a toughness and in charge kind of person, but he lately seems rather bored with it all;
*Ken Olandt, who usually plays a good guy, is really very bad as the villain;
*Ursula Brooks as the rape victim starts out bitchy, then unexplicably becomes McGinley's soul partner;
*The rest of the cast including the man who plays Griffin are overwrought and unconvincing, and even the young nerd who plays Newton is derivative of other nerdish characters;
*the special effects are very amateurish, and the earthquake scenes, which are very brief, are filmed at night and nowhere near as effecive as those in the tv thriller AFTER SHOCK.
The movie seems long, and while it concentrates on character development, the action scenes are unimaginative and dull.
Not a bad movie, but not great either.  Rent instead of buy, though.",1078185600,3,1121,4.894736842105263

7944863,3,B00005M2CY,"Moments of great drama mixed with mediocre acting.  Although an 80's style movie, could have been written, acted and directed better.  Not bad though for free prime movie.",1521676800,,171,5.071428571428571

7944865,3,B00005M2CY,"I streamed it for free as I am an Amazon Prime member. Truthfully, I would not pay to see this movie. They took some pretty decent actors in Roy Scheider and Ted McGinley. Including a bunch of still working actors who had some success about 20 years ago, and came up with an ok film. Just enough to keep my attention while I was doing other things. It's pretty low budget. The set looks more like it was a rehearsal set. There was really no tension, no suspense, no real sense of danger. But it did what it was supposed to do, occupy my time. Sometimes it's good to watch a movie just because you like the actors and just need to chill.",1513296000,,636,4.178861788617886
7944866,3,B00005M2CY,"This movie was alright, for a 1980's type movie, which this seems more like than the 2001 date it is given.  It's obviously a tv movie with some of the familiar faces of the time, and a familiar storyline with the usual mix of characters, some of whom you like, one in particular was an absolute jerk from beginning right through his ending, which didn't come soon enough as far as I'm concerned, while another should have met his same fate but didn't, one can only hope that he gets exactly what he deserves. Don't expect any spectacular special effects or death defying thrills, this is low-budget, but it is a nice little movie to kill some time.",1512345600,,649,4.5
7944867,1,B00005M2CY,"Good grief.  What a bunch of whiny, nasty, unpleasant ungrateful bitchy little characters.  If it was me I'd leave them there on their own.  I'm halfway through and already so sick and tired of their behavior that I'm fixing to just shut the dratted thing off.  I may try to soldier on through but it's not looking good.  Oh yeah, the acting is horrendously bad.  Don't be fooled by the Roy Scheider ""draw"", it's not worth it.  He can't make the movie worth watching when the other characters are so horrible.",1508025600,,509,4.527472527472527

7944869,1,B00005M2CY,"Very bad movie, it seemed like it was a college project with a script by someone who used to write commercials for dog food ads. Had to fast forward it to get through it but really a waste of time.",1501632000,,197,3.95
