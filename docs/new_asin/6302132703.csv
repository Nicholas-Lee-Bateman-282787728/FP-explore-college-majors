429729,5,6302132703,"Gary Busey is a disturning individual...this is well known. What happens when you put him in a movie about a man obsessed with a family, well you get a darn good movie!
Busey shines as a recently released mental patient in search of a family...the perfect family. As his dreams go astray, the Busey-man goes wild. Mimi Rogers and Michael Mckeon round out a steller cast in this early 90's straight to video classic.
A true thriller, with a great ending. Highly recommended.",1020902400,11,473,4.710843373493976

429731,1,6302132703,"From the cover, you imagine cape fear, but with Gary Busy and Mimi Rogers.  No.  This is much stupider.  Busey is just released from a mental hospital and sneaks into his old house and makes a room in the attick.  The house is  empty, but Mimi and her family move in that day.  He spies on her and the  family, rumages through the house at night, and tries to put moves on Mimi  and fails.  Thought Mimi does look good, she is not naked at all in this  flick.  I have seen a lot of Busey's films and though he's a good actor,  this is his worst film.  Stupid cast, screenplay, and story.  1 star.",955411200,,596,4.069565217391304

429887,5,6302132703,"This is one of my favorite Gary Busey movies. His plotting and planning while living in the attic of these people's home is fabulous. To watch him silently claim this family as his own is beyond scary. If you are a fan of Busey, you simply have to add this to your movie collection.",1380931200,,282,4.2407407407407405
429888,5,6302132703,"When it comes to being weird and creepy there isn't a soul who does it better than Mr. Gary Busey. The man is an on screen legend whose best defined as an insane genius. He has blown us away with his incredible acting prowess on more than one occasion, most notably in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-the-Tiger/dp/B0006TPDR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of the Tiger</a>. While continuing a nice vacation week the search for fine quality B continued. When we stumbled upon Hider in the House we were intrigued by the creepy cover. Upon further inspection we realized that the freakshow in the window is non other than the elusive, giant toothed Busey. We were thrilled and immediately cued it up without any doubts. The one question that circled our wagon was ""how have we never seen this movie before?"" We have found so many incredible B movies over the years and find it troubling to have never heard of this. It's honestly the role Gary Busey was born to play. At this point in his life the plot may be more of a reality than a fictional film. There's no doubt that Busey has or currently dwells in somebody's attic living off of Hostess snowballs and canned beans (an actual meal he ate in the film). A meal in which he ate with a combat knife. It is as good as it sounds people, trust us!

Hider in the House starts out with some graphic dialogue of a young boy being abused by his parents. Turns out this boy was in fact Gary Busey who plays Tom Sykes in the film. We catch up with Tom years later as he is being released from a mental institution he's lived in for many years. Due to his frequent violent outbreaks the staff is hesitant to release him into civilization, yet they send him on out anyway. While creeping through a nice neighborhood he finds a newly renovated house he likes. Despite the fact a family already lives there he decides to call this place his home. He achieves this by securing a cozy spot behind an attic wall where he dwells like a common field mouse. In typical psychotic fashion he listens to the families every move and starts to consider himself part of the gang. When everyone leaves for the day he wanders around the house and goes through their things, snacks on their food. Yeah it's that creepy, but oh so hilarious. Gary seems way too comfortable in his performance. Eventually he finds out the husband is having an affair and sets him up so the wife kicks him to the curb. This now gives Busey the in to stroll on by and make his move. He pretends to be a neighbor, despite squatting in her attic, and puts the moves on her. When she turns him down he elevates the insanity to a whole new level, which one couldn't imagine as a possibility. He starts having panic attacks like the Big Guy after a Brett pick returned for a touchdown. Eventually she finds this secret spot in the attic and is attacked by Busey as he hides in the shadows. A huge fight ensues and Busey gets shot dead, leaving the attic spot vacant for Don Swayze to eventually move in.

Hider in the House is by far one of the best B's we have ever seen from Busey. The man has an acting range that couldn't be met by anyone else in Hollywood. It's incredible to think when this film was made, Gary was still considered to be a sane human. This is the reason there is no doubt at this stage in life he really does live in someones attic. After watching this, anytime you hear some rustling in your attic you will wonder ""oh no, what if there's a Busey in the attic."" Good luck finding an exterminator to take care of that problem. In fact in the movie they suspect the attic rustling is rats and have an exterminator lace the area with toxic gas. Watching Busey behind a wall getting dosed with gas fumes is one of the funniest things you may ever see. Of course he flips his lid and kills the exterminator with a flashlight, which was also hilarious. Just when you'd think this movie couldn't be any better, we come to find out it was released as a made for tv movie on the USA Network. Not even direct to video but direct to tv. You're not getting any better than that. Hider in the House has just about everything you could ever want in a B with absolutely no lulls. It even has an understated ""To Catch a Predator"" vibe at certain points, just minus the Hansen appearance. Is that a yes? So without a doubt we strongly suggest watching this film as soon as possible. Do it now!",1369958400,4,4446,4.46068796068796
429889,3,6302132703,I was upset to see the disclaimer of possibly not being able to play due to european recording. Should make that more clear on sale previously,1365724800,,142,4.5
429890,5,6302132703,"I really enjoyed this flick. A new family moves to this beautiful home. Home is your privacy. Or is it? You don't know whos watching you. I chose this rating of a film to be very suspenseful,unprdicting,and very quick minded .How a strange off beat man had to use his quick thinking all the time. Yes I would recommend this dvd to a friend. It is another region (2 ) If your player is a universal dvd player to play this movie your set to go. good scary momments in this movie .",1359936000,2,478,4.150537634408602
429891,5,6302132703,"I LOVED this movie because it reminds me of the plot of ""Bad Ronald"" and it is a good movie to watch while it is raining and if you have ever been in a secret passage in a house.

Busey's portrayal makes it excellent as he always appears to be contemplating something new and he makes it a PLAUSIBLE story as he is CLEVER in the things he does to delay and prevent his discovery. If it is funny in parts, it is because you see the human side and kindness of a man.

But you also see rage welling up inside him and his decline & development to more violent acts. The progression of his childhood at the beginning and his falling through the cracks with the psycho-analysis, makes it particularly interesting from a criminal psychiatry standpoint. The drama is intense, especially when an exterminator sprays his area and nearly kills him!

The pace is perfect, as his feelings for the wife develop and he eavesdrops enough to cause trouble for the couple he is observing.

Great innocence & love for family shown by Mimi Rogers.
Excelllent affectionate coupled with desperation acted by Busey.",1206489600,3,1092,4.584615384615384
7821698,2,6302132703,"Age-Old cliche's used in a very sloppy. This by no means compares to something like ""Bad Ronald"" or ""Crawlspace"" (Arthur Kennedy) which are mega-creepy. HITH is just plain bad. Busey has his moments, and he is a great actor, does his best to save this flick but to no avail. Way too many scenes that make you go ...""OMG, no way ANYONE would ever do or say that crazy or not, it makes no sense!"". I really tried to enjoy this movie...I gave it a few chances but just too many mistakes and holes....all over the place. Good luck, maybe you'll like it.",1526083200,,549,4.339805825242719
