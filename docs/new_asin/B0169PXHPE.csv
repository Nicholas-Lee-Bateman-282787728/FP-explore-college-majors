7465418,1,B0169PXHPE,Way over priced.  I was looking at picking up the series as I had not seen them and a couple of friends recommended it.  5 seasons for 139.00 or the individual season for a total of less than 90.00.  Not bad for 5 season until you look closely and the seasons are less than half seasons.  Only 4 seasons had 10 episodes and 1 had 12 for a total of 52 episodes.  At that point even the 90.00 seems high.  I cannot imagine I would pay more than  60.00 for 52 episodes.,1456272000,22,466,4.0
7465419,4,B0169PXHPE,Great Show! My only negative concern is the distance of time between Seasons u don't get to see. You only see the resulting issue or conflict.,1456099200,2,142,4.5
7465420,5,B0169PXHPE,"To those who love the show then it is cool to get. If you have them Season by Season that is also cool.
I would like to Correct that their is more than One Disc which it Explains in what it said about.
Sometimes you have to add up each Season to see which is better and it is up to all to see what you want to do.",1454457600,2,313,3.550724637681159
7465421,4,B0169PXHPE,"Falling Skies only ran 5 season
While it was a once great series the final 5th season is cheap garbage
With that being said if you want to get the complete Series of Falling Skies on blu ray just wait for when they are on sale and buy them piece by piece you can usually get season 1-3 for less then $12.00 a pop
This box set has no new exclusives that make this worth getting (There is a gimmicky fake coin aka prop coin i doubt it's a real prop though)
Even the box that houses the cases looks very cheap
This box set is very much like the NBC Heroes blu ray box set has no real point in being made
If this hits the price point around $60.00 or less it might be worth it (Keep in mind if you watch Season 1-4 then get to the final Season you'll be super disappoint in every possible way (If you want to be spoiled my review of Season 5 is on here with lots of Spoilers and such) Terrible season
The way season 4 ends should've been the real ending",1453075200,20,949,3.9479166666666665

7465465,5,B0169PXHPE,"Falling Skies is a unique 5 year series with awesome aliens and cast. I saw 5 years worth in 2 days! Couldn't stop watching it. Loved that there was no cussing, just really good writing. Amazon had the best price.",1517443200,,213,4.35

7465467,5,B0169PXHPE,Great on my new 4K tv and Blue Ray player,1516838400,,41,3.2
7465468,5,B0169PXHPE,What a great series! With so much trash on tv these days I'm truly surprised this series only lasted 5 seasons. Nothing about it is over the top and it is kept in the realm of the believable. I love the camaraderie of the Second Mass (Second Massachusetts). They are like a family. The characters have a great caring for one another and always seem to have each others backs and best interests no matter what. If I were in this situation these are the people Id like to be a part of. I hated seeing this series come to an end!,1516838400,,526,4.166666666666667
7465469,5,B0169PXHPE,A great sci-fi Show with good development and fthe characters Interesting with many side stories that do not send the show off the mission to defeat a aliens against overwhelming odds,1516233600,,183,4.935483870967742

7465471,5,B0169PXHPE,"I watched this wonderful series on APrime and love it. Amazon, please bring it back to Prime!
The 5Star reviews say it all. So unfortunate that the powers ended the show after only 5 seasons...the good always ""die"" young, I guess.
Thanks to Noah and cast for a superb job.",1515974400,,272,4.46
7465492,4,B0169PXHPE,Corner was a little crushed --- not real pleased with that aspect of the purchase.,1515024000,,82,4.533333333333333

7465494,5,B0169PXHPE,"This series is: Epic.  While I did not care for the increasing use of bad language, the story lines and character developments were great.  You grow to care about the characters.  You also learn lessons about what really matters in life, caring for one another, and helping your fellow humans survive under the most unbelievable conditions you could imagine.",1509840000,,358,5.033898305084746

7465532,5,B0169PXHPE,"Having only seen season 3, I was compelled to watch seasons 1, 2, 4, & 5. The boxed set of Falling Skies is incredible. Uniting a future alien invasion through the lens  Colonial History of the U.S.A. was a brilliant creative idea. This cinema journey says so much about the times that we are currently living in.",1498435200,,313,4.491228070175438
7465533,5,B0169PXHPE,"So well done. As a sci-fi fan, this show is more plausible than most. More realistic than most shows because good people die (spoiler alert).",1495065600,,141,4.68

7465535,5,B0169PXHPE,"I'm not much of a sci-fi fan but I loved this series.  It was interesting, the characters were well developed over time and much of the alien stuff was well done -- looked ""real.""  One of the creatures looked and behaved like a 6th grader made it up but the rest was all well done.  Who's to say what an alien creature might look like.",1490659200,2,335,4.123076923076923

7465539,5,B0169PXHPE,"Found the show quite interesting when I was working afternoon shift, when at some point they changed time slot and I couldn't find it. So I missed part of last season and had been looking for it on Hulu and Netflix...no joy. Was very excited to find it here at Amazon and just HAD to order it and find out how it ended. Loved it.",1485993600,2,329,4.076923076923077

7465593,1,B0169PXHPE,"If I could give it a zero I would. If you're thinking about picking this up because you've never seen it before or maybe you started watching it and life got in the way... don't. Spoiler alert: THE ENDING STINKS! I was an avid watcher of this show until the very end and all I can say is that's 50 hours of my life I'll never get back. It felt like the producers or the network or somebody said ""wrap this up quickly, we're running out of money!"" 49 episodes of buildup for a one episode ending that was the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Not only was it full of stupid conclusions  (like organic life forms will simply explode when you kill their leader) but it just insulted you like someone coming into your house and pooping on your couch. I realize that you have to suspend disbelief in some shows like most adventure and science fiction shows of late, but this was too much. Run in fear science fiction fans, run in fear.",1475280000,26,926,4.291428571428572
7465594,5,B0169PXHPE,Best series of all time!!! What a great program and was so disappointed when it was abruptly cancelled!!!! Hope they go to the big screen!,1475280000,,138,4.56
7465595,2,B0169PXHPE,"A poster child for a promising show that went bad quickly and reaches levels that were laugh out loud funny before the end. Once the show decided to make the professor into a war hero, and made Col. Weaver into a goober, it was over. So much promised wasted. This DVD set should be free. Or maybe they pay you to buy it.",1475280000,2,320,4.095238095238095

7465597,2,B0169PXHPE,"Four and five stars for a collection that's at least half mediocre at best?  By the third season this show was done--the writers didn't know how to sustain the characters at all.  Season three was mediocre at best, four was worse, and five, well. . . .  If you want the truly interesting seasons, just get one and two and stop after two.  The last few seasons were simply milking the sympathy that the first two seasons had developed for the characters--they really did nothing to develop them and they resorted to a lot of cheap and easy plot ""twists"" that were really awful and forced many of the characters to turn into completely different people.",1475280000,,651,4.586206896551724
7465598,5,B0169PXHPE,"I loved this show. the storyline,actors to the actress's. i am not a big fan of the walking dead to me that is cheaply made. i have always been a fan of aliens and space. it was nice to have a show do it right. them helping and taking over earth. if you have a love for aliens and space. this show is for you.

just have an open mind of this show. give it a chance. for me. there was a story inside a story. story line was kinda like the walking dead but with a few things different. they didn't kill people off. aliens just took them. they came back next season changed.

this is a great price for all the seasons. i see a lot of people saying the 5th season sucked. well all the seasons of the walking dead suck! the  series was amazing start to finish. take it from me a real fan. i watched this show when it was on tv every night it was on. so in the end if you like aliens awesome story, love,drama,gun fights, blowing up space ships, this is the show for you. i hope this helps!",1475280000,6,984,3.95959595959596
7465599,4,B0169PXHPE,The only inconsistency is that the package does not include DVD versions. It only has Blu ray and the digital HD. The set is still great and I'm very pleased.,1474070400,,158,4.3
