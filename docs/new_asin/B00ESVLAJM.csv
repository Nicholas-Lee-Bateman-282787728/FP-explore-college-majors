8609060,4,B00ESVLAJM,"Author/director Diane Kurys created this important little film in 2013 and it has not had the exposure it deserves. It is a contemporary story that reflects n World War II, the Holocaust, marital infidelity, and the strength of sustaining love struggling against the vagaries of time, memory, and courage of surviving the atrocities of war.

Very simply, FOR A WOMAN (Pour une femme) is the story of the marriage between Michel (Benot Magimel) and Lena (Mlanie Thierry) as told by their daughter Anne (Sylvie Testud) with reflections on the mystery of abiding love. Michel and Lena escaped a Nazi death camp under the guise of being engaged. They married, had children, separated, and died. The time frame is between 1947, shortly into the marriage, and the 1980s, when the mother has died and the father is ill. Anne, the younger of the couple's two daughters, is a filmmaker going through her mother's mementos and reconstructing the events of the early marriage. During the period in 1947, the husband's brother Jean (Nicolas Duvauchelle) reappears. Thought to have been killed in the war, his reappearance creates many questions and triggers stresses in the marriage  among which is Jeans alliance with an anti-Nazi group (with Sacha - Clment Sibony) and the effects that has on his relationship with Lena.

The acting is outstanding; the messages about the Jewish/Nazi conflict, and the ability of love to survive almost every obstacle are important and well portrayed. Recommended. In French with English subtitles. Grady Harp, April 18",1525046400,,1542,5.135458167330677

Diane Kurys does an extraordinary job depicting this semi-biographical account of her mother and her father, and the events involving her profoundly dramatic family history from 1942 and into the post WWII years, after the Nazi Party was finally exposed for what it  really was. It's also a wonderful romantic story of true love.  This is further proof that you do not have to spend a 100 million dollars to produce an extraordinary film. Members of the Academy should give this film a serious look. I am absolutely sure this is one of The Best Foreign Films of the year.  This film was more moving than Schindler's List.
