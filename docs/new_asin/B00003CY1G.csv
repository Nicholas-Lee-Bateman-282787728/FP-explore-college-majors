1293854,4,B00003CY1G,A very under rated movie....good story line.....I would rate this movie up at the top of gang like movies.....not anywhere near Blood In Blood Out but very good in it's own right...I am buying this one to add to my growing DVD collection,1034121600,,237,4.534883720930233
1293855,4,B00003CY1G,"The only reason I'm not giving this a five is because it had a practically non-existant soundtrack.  The film reminded me a lot of ""A Bronx Tale"" not in plot, but in storytelling style.  Despite everyone saying that they would rather have their face bounced off of a telephone pole rather than wacth this, I found it to be better than what the critics said.  In any case, rent it first.",1033948800,,386,4.408450704225352
1293856,1,B00003CY1G,I would rather be injected with the Ebola virus than watch this monstroscity of a movie one more time.  The only redeeming factor is Adrianna from the Sopranos and she doesnt even get naked.  This wanna be West Side Story/Outsiders scriptwriter should be taken into an alley and shanked in the liver with a screwdriver. Rack the Glock and keep a bullet handy when watching this flick~,1033430400,4,384,4.7164179104477615
1293857,4,B00003CY1G,"I found this to be an excellent movie.  As soon as it ended, I rewound it and started watching it again.  I am a big fan of the 1950's and I like the street gang lore, so perhaps I am a bit biased.  If you're not a fan of the 50's and you're not interested in movies about street gangs, don't bother. Otherwise, purchase this video!  You will definitely love it.  The cast is wonderful and the scenery really takes you back in time.  The soundtrack is great too, with goodies such as Dion and Ritchie Valens.  What are you waiting for?  Get this movie!",1031270400,,552,4.190476190476191
1293858,4,B00003CY1G,"Deuces Wild is about a gang war between the Deuces and the Vipers. Things get complicated when Fairuza Balk's character, the leader of an all-girl gang, falls in love with a member of a rival gang.
My bet is on Deuces Wild for the most underrated movie The plot kept you interested These kind of street gang movies catches my attention but Deuces Wild it wasn't as good as (A Bronx Tale) or (Carlito's Way) but it was a movie worth seeing.",1031011200,,439,4.365853658536586
1293859,5,B00003CY1G,My favorite movie of 2002. I wrote Norman Reddus and told him he did a great job as Marco and he wrote me back...Cool guy. Great Flick,1027036800,,134,4.0
1293860,5,B00003CY1G,"I was blown away by this movie!  It is so realistic, and the historical view of gangs in the 50s is dead on.  Me being a second generation greaser from a big city, I could really appreciate and identify with this movie because there were things in the movie that were similiar to what my dad always told me being a greaser was like back then.  I have always been into these films because they represent the culture I grew up around.  I would recommend this film to anyone into the 50's,or greaser
gangs.",1022112000,,503,4.319148936170213

The plot was weak and for having such a great cast, with a couple exceptions, the acting wasn't believable. A good film transports you to the situation, place and time. This film just never did for me. Grease had more believable 50's gangs than this.",1465344000,,423,4.578947368421052

Once Stephen Dorff (Leon) and James Franco (Tino) do their porch buddy, buddy scene I could no longer watch the movie.  It became more of a hey look at me I am in a movie type vibe after that; you know movies that stuff as many cameo appearances in as they can to list an ""amazing"" cast.  Well, ruined the movie for me.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was they did the period piece, okay.",1464220800,,542,4.133333333333334

1294577,4,B00003CY1G,"Steven Dorff is great as the gang leader and Walking Dead fans who haven't seen this will also love Dorffs enemy and rival gang leader Marco. There are quite a few well known people in this Matt Dillon etc, as well as supporting actors you will recognize.

The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is the absolute horrible character that is Dorffs younger brother. I am not convinced for even a  millisecond, that this s a tough guy whatsoever. He looks like someone I took lunch money off of when  was a kid.

Besides that poser, the movie is pretty good.",1462838400,,561,4.41747572815534

1295189,4,B00003CY1G,"This is enjoyable period piece set in the 1950's as rival youth gangs vie for control of a block or two in Brooklyn.  The cast is very good including Matt Dillon, Stephen Dorff, and for you Walking Dead fans a young Norman Reedus.  If there is anything really wrong with the movie is that the pace is not consistent, side stories distract but are never given meaning, and you don't get a chance to really like some of the characters before they are put in jeopardy.

Two rival gangs, one who wants to expand the drug trade, the other who wants to eliminate drugs from their street gear up to do battle.  Not many gang members have guns so they resort to clubs and baseball bats (guns make fighting too simple, apparaently-real men fight man to man).  The end result is tragic but if it is possible for a movie like this to have a happy ending, this manages to pull it off.  A wheelbarrow full of concrete blocks pushed off a roof onto a car is one way to kill a rival that no other director has thought of yet.

1296138,2,B00003CY1G,"Are the ""Deuces"" a true violent gang, or does MTV just portray them that way?  As I sit here struggling to connect my words for this pathetic attempt of a ""gang turned Shakespeare's tragedy"" film involving the ever buff Stephen Dorff and the slowly decaying Brad Renfro.  This is a story, not unlike others that we have seen done better, about violence, drug problems, and falling for the girl that you least expect.  It is ""Romeo & Juliet"", fixed up like ""West Side Story"", with fights that would no doubtably see the award ranking at that year's MTV Movie Awards.  I cannot say if that is what made this film at times unbearable to watch, or if it is what pulled me into watching it a second time to see what the director had to say about his actions.  Either way, I made it through two viewings of ""Deuces Wild"" and before I hear usurped ""gasps"" from the peanut gallery, I must say, this is definitely not a film that get better with age.

Using whatever leftover table scraps ""The Sopranos"" wanted to throw, coupled with a storyline recycled from every Hollywood recreation of this genre, ""Deuces Wild"" begins haphazardly and continues along the trend for the next 96 minutes.  Is it brother's vengeance?  Is it due to rival gangs making sure that their territory is never advanced by the other?  Is is because of money?  Is it because of love?  I mention these questions again because I believe these random unanswered questions, which lead into a convoluted violent ending, are what hurt the overall picture of ""Deuces Wild"".  From the beginning, we do not know the true motives of our characters.  Dorff, the obvious leader, seems more like the lover instead of the fighter, but when it is time to do what is just, he apparently turns into a machine with fists that could take down a passenger train.  Renfro, the hard-boiled little brother, doesn't seem like the obvious choice to swoon the possible leader of the all-girl group.  His second-grade reading and interpretation of the script, makes him seem more like muscle instead of brains.  I believe that if Dorff would have taken control of Renfro's character and vice versa, perhaps a better film would have come from this conclusion, but alas, we were stuck with what was the final product.  Balk, who plays Renfro's love interest, is annoying and void of emotion.  Her true nature is never revealed, and it is up to us to realize that these two lovers happened to be at the right place at the right time, the action surrounding them is just static.

I have to continue with the characters for a bit more because they were the failing glue that could not keep this film stuck together.  Norman Reedus, the weaselly-villain-esque character had angry eyes and an obsession with power ... why?  I have no idea.  He liked drugs and wanted to distribute, or did he just want to make trouble for Dorff and Renfro?  This continues my theory that no true character development occurred, which dumbstruck this viewer from beginning to end.  I don't want to repeat myself for Balthazar Getty's character of Jimmy Pockets.  Again, nothing seemed set or hardened with these guys.  They did what they want, whenever they wanted.  That works in most gang films, but when empathy needs to be felt for someone, it is probably better not to just let the fists do the talking.  Was that Johnny Knoxville in there as well?  Nothing like James Franco playing the same character of James Dean for this role?  This transformed into nothing more than pathetic over-use of similar moments.  It was sad.  It was recycled.  It was unoriginal at best.  It was a gangster film married to ""West Side Story"" for the fast-paced MTV generation.

For 96 minutes we were stuck with these characters, so I watched, hoping that perhaps the cinematography would take me to a far away land - perhaps the language would reintroduce me to the genre, or maybe the story would sweep me away.  Well, I wanted something to distract me from the characters, but alas, it never happened.  The story, as mentioned before, was recycled.  The visions seemed like they belonged on stage instead of on screen.  After listening to the audio commentary, the director seemed to agree as well since most of the budget couldn't take them to an actual location, but instead a sound stage in LA.  The angles seemed short and the people seemed tight in every scene.  I am surprised that we didn't seem cameras in every shot.  I felt claustrophobic in every scene, even when the gang was fighting.  I have to pause and laugh now, because the fight sequences were possibly the lightest element in the film.  Does lightening have to spring into the scene just to make those known that the air has grown angry?  Lightening and fight sequences, is it the match-up that we have been waiting for all of our cinematic life?  In this film, the answered question is: yes.

Poor acting, poor cinematography, cheap dialog, why does this film rate so high among film watchers?  Some claim that it is the darker side of ""West Side Story"", which I could argue against.  There wasn't a dark undertone to this film at all.  The choreography to the fight sequences made me laugh, the themes of which the characters drew themselves upon were simple, never quite the complex characters that we anticipated.  There was no logic to this film, just remake followed by recycling, followed up by further cheapened cliche's that can be found in any other film of this genre.  This is not ""Goodfellas"", so let us not try to make the comparison.  Did this film accurately depict the era that it attempted to represent?  To me, the answer is no.  Well, I have officially become to bitter to continue this conversation.  I wasn't happy, nor can I suggest this film to anyone with a straight face.  Nothing was put together well, the voice of the film seemed amateur at best.  Skip it - you will be happier!

1296139,2,B00003CY1G,"Stephen Dorff (Blade, Entropy) stars as the leader of the gang called the Deuces and he was stricken years ago when one of his brothers died from an overdose that his enemy on the otherside of the street, the leader of the Vipers, played by Norman Reedus (Blade 2, Gossip) gave him. Now, Reedus springs out of prison and wants to take revenge on the Deuces starting a club on their side. Brad Renfro (The Jacket, Tart) plays the second older brother of Dorff who falls madly in love with a member of the Vipers sisters, played by Fairuza Balk (Almost Famous, The Craft) but his brother Dorff has his suspicions about her and doesnt want Renfro to be going out with her. Then things heat up as both gangs go head on in fights and brawls to see who comes out on top. Sometimes boring, nothing that can bring it up to be a good movie.

1296232,4,B00003CY1G,"when i heard about DEUCES WILD back in late 1999 early 2000,i was elated at the prospect of there finally being another 50's/early 60's type of street gang melodrama on the horizon.
yet,of course,because of the 9/11 incident in new york,the a-holes in hollywood decided to push back its release for quite a while,so i had to be content with the occasional promo photo in random movie magazines.
finally the movie came out without much fanfare,alas it was also the 'spiderman' weekend,and also the innocuos 'lord of the rings' was in theatres as well that weekend,but luckilly that meant i was in the movie theatre with just myself,my girl and about ten other people.
i thought the movie was excellent,great costumes,great cars,great period music,great locations,good yet hammy acting,gorgeous leading ladies,stylized violent rumble scenes,cheezy yet touching overacted scenes between familys,decent period detail.
yet then the reviews started coming in,and everybody who had ever had freshmen english or drama class compared it annoyingly to west side story,a 1961 singing and dancing musical,when they should have made comparisons to another tho far superior 1961 gang film,john frankenhiemer's black and white opus,'the young savages',or even to photographer bruce davidson's late 50's photo essay,'brooklyn gang' or even the short comic story in the late 70's underground comic,'50's funnies',called,'turf',about a gang in the 50's fighting with another gang who wanted drugs in the neiborhood and who had mob backing and a character was even named marco.....awfully convenient don't you think?
anyways,while this movie wasn't as good as 'the young savages','lords of flatbush' or 'the wanderers',to name but a few,but it was a hundred times better than the wimpy 'west side story' could ever be.
i don't know if this review helps,but the leads in this film were really good,stephen dorf,brad renfro,drea dematteo,faruiza balk,matt dillon,normon reedus and james franco putting in good performances......also i liked the fact that they did,nt over saturate the film with to much music from the past,it was just the right amount,very good choices of songs by 'dion and the belmonts','jerry butler and the impressions','the valentines','dee clark' and a few others.
and of course,faruiza balk and drea dematteo,tho a little long in the tooth to be playing teenagers,looked absolutely scrumptiuos.",1108857600,2,2397,5.5340599455040875
1296233,5,B00003CY1G,"Scott Kalvert did an outstanding job directing this movie and making the time period as realistic as possible. The similarity between this and Westside Story is the gang rivalry. In Westside Story, you have The Jets vs. The Sharks and in this movie you have The Deuces vs. The Vipers. I didn't see all of Westside Story though but  it seems like its less intense than this movie. This movie has some Rebel Without A Cause as well but I didn't see that movie either. I compare this movie to Rebel Without A Cause because of the gang element and Stephen Dorff is The Jimmy Dean of this movie. Stephen Dorff does a great job as 'Leon', the noble yet violent leader of The Deuces. Brad Renfro also does a great job as Leon's younger brother Bobby. He is easily influenced by his brother's hatred towards The Vipers and his life-style is even more chaotic when he meets 'Annie', who is played by Fairuza Balk. Drea DeMateo was so so as 'Betsy', Norman Reedus does a great job as 'Marco', and Matt Dillion does a great job as 'Fritzy'. Overall, its a powerful and intense movie and a must see for movie fans. You'll be pleasantly surprised!",1101513600,6,1134,4.478260869565218

1296235,3,B00003CY1G,"This movie has many, many flaws. Fairuza Balk is way too old to be playing a teenager dating (portly) Brad Renfro; the dialogue is totally corny; and the camera work is awful. Other than that, it's not a bad movie. The story is very, very much like many movies you've already seen that were better: The Outsiders, West Side Story, A Bronx Tale, etc., etc. The soundtrack is excellent; the scene with Fairuza and Brad in a steamy pool is hot. Definitely worth watching for any one who likes movies about the 1950s/Italians/gangs/teenagers. My favorite BAD line is when Brad Renfro says it's 115 degrees outside, even though HE is the one wearing a leather jacket!",1068249600,,662,4.7155172413793105
1296236,5,B00003CY1G,"I loved Deuces Wild. The cast was out-standing and it was well-written. It didn't leave out the little and most important things that most movies do. It really captured the street gangs of the 50's. It left me on the edge of my seat at times and other times I wanted to cry. The only thing I would've changed is made some of the bad guys, good guys because you never want a cute guy to be a bad guy. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!",1059264000,4,446,4.079545454545454
1296237,5,B00003CY1G,"My father was a gang member in 1956 Queens, New York. He told me stories about Zipguns and bats he used for protection. He also told me how realistic this movie was just by taking a look at the way the gang members wore their belts. The belt buckle was always worn just above the left front pocket! I wish I could have been there to back my father up! Forget about Hollywood's  Outsiders & Rumble Fish brat pack, that was fictional bull! Also recommend Blackboard Jungle.",1052092800,11,471,4.413793103448276
1296238,2,B00003CY1G,"If you have seen ""The Basketball Diaries"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio (and Mark Wahlberg aka ""Marky Mark""), and imagine the storyline like ""West Side Stories,"" then you get the rough idea of what ""Deuces Wild"" could be.  You get an impressive cast showing good acting, and awfully flashy camerawork, given by the director Scott Calvert, hwo came back to the job of directing a feature film after 7 years of his previous ""The Basketball Diaries.""
The film, which in itself is nothing original, tells a story set in 1958, but the more important is the cast.  Two groups are fighting over the blocks of Brooklyn, New York: they are  Deuces and Vipers.  The leader of ""Deuces"" Leon is played by Stephen Dorff while Brad Renfro is his younger brother Bobby, who falls in love with a girl (whose brother happens to belong to the enemy group Vipers ... sound familiar?).  Vipers' leader has been doing time in jail, but now he is coming back as Norman Reedus, who happens to be Leon's ex-sweetheart.  Now you know what is going to happen on the street, festival at night, and the like.  And you will be watching that all the grown-up females (including Deborah Harry of Blondie) are either drunk or listening to Christmas songs (in summer); and Matt Dillon, directly from his days of ""Rumblefish"" made 20 years ago, is still playing a local mobster.  The last thing makes me sad.
Sure, it's fight after fight, using knuckles and blocks and blades, and you know in the end somebody must be gunned down.  It is regrettable that this banal story tends to obscure the fact that production designs re-creating the streets of New York in the 1950s deserve much praise.  Even though the soundtrack music is just a bunch of usual line-ups (like Dion and the Belmonts), the film surely gives some atmosphere that is lost forever.
Except for the merit I mentioned last above, however, ""Deuces Wild"" is a hugely disappointing piece of work, and director Calvert's MTV-like showy camera, which clearly betrays his origin, is doing great harm to the materials which are good in themselves.  After all, he is guilty of turning Jim Carrol's rather poetic nature of the original book into a terribly dismal account of a drug-addict in ""The Basketball Diaries.""  So, what can we expect?",1046822400,4,2261,4.784061696658098
1296239,2,B00003CY1G,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie because of its all-star cast, but I was disappointed by the film's poor writing. The storyline was extremely cliched and predictable, as was the dialogue. It seems like the writer of Deuces Wild took every greaser movie cliche you've ever seen and rolled it into one script.
On top of that, the attempts at New York accents were not very accurate.
Renfro and Balk are the film's one bright spot, their characters seem to have a little more depth than the others, and they have good on-screen chemistry. Renfro is believable and sweet as a well-meaning guy who is torn between loyalty to his brother (who is leader of the neighborhood gang) and asserting his independence by courting the girl he loves (who just so happens to be the sister of the gang's rival)
Balk is charming as a sensitive girl pretending to be a ""tough city chick"" meanwhile she is watching city life destroy her family and all she wants to do is escape.
It is a shame that this big name cast didn't get a better script and a more original storyline to work with.",1044230400,9,1076,4.523076923076923
1296240,4,B00003CY1G,"Deuces Wild is quite an entertaining film.  The plot is simple with two rival gangs at each others throats in Brooklyn.  Though this film is not what you would call a masterpiece, it is enjoyable and dreamy Stephen Dorff is a pleasure to watch.  He is the only reason why I would see this film over and over again.  Fairuza fans will find this film enjoyable.  Balk plays a significant role and her character is an important component to the film's plot.  She does a good job and looks pretty as always with those stunning blue eyes.  A surprisingly good film!",1036800000,,560,4.485148514851486
