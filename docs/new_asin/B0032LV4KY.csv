4061501,1,B0032LV4KY,"I was disappointed in the movie for 3 very important reasons:
1.  Adoption was not shone in a favorable light.  This bothered my 5-year old daughter who is adopted.  She wondered why somebody who can't have children would not want to adopt.  The movie makes you feel like adoption is ""not the same"" as having a biological child.  I have both.  Let me assure everyone that adoption is every bit as special as having a child biologically.  I understand that the male star of this movie does indeed come around to being willing to accept an adopted child, but to a young child such as my own, the quick reference at the end that adoption is okay, did not register with her after the bigger movie scene where adoption is not favorable.
2.  The man takes God's name in vain.
3.  If you are a strong Christian (not Catholic) this movie is not for you.  It has way too many Catholic beliefs such as the power of saints.  As for me and my house, I want my children to grow up putting their faith in their creator and His son, not someone that others have deemed a saint.  I had to discuss the errors of this movie with my children.  I wish I never would have watched it with them.
It has a cute storyline, so if you don't care about adoption, taking God's name in vain, or teaching non-Biblical principles, then you will think this movie is cute.",1285372800,31,1338,4.325301204819277
4061502,1,B0032LV4KY,"Mexico gets the usual stereotypical US world view - donkeys, third world, quaint peasant generosity, etc.  A serious issue (marital stress through inability to conceive) is reduced to a shallow story line and a desperately-labored Damascus episode.  The only mystery or tension is how the actors kept a straight face.  It was so bad I had to watch it all!  Leaves me anxious about the state of US entertainment and values in the 21st century.  We must, surely, have better things to do with our time?",1283472000,5,500,4.767441860465116
4061503,3,B0032LV4KY,"This was a cute story line, but it left you feeling a little short-changed because they didn't go as in depth into the story or characters as they could have.  I never felt like I connected with the characters.  I would recommend renting it over buying it.",1281312000,5,256,4.425531914893617
4061504,5,B0032LV4KY,"Great touching movie about love and courage.  Cheech Marin is always a joy to watch and the story line, though simplistic, is enjoyable.",1278633600,3,136,4.913043478260869
4061505,4,B0032LV4KY,This was very good.  It showed the healing of a family relationship.  We need more of such encouraging portrayals today!  I would recommend it to all!,1273276800,5,150,4.6923076923076925
4061506,4,B0032LV4KY,"This is another good movie about love & marriage and in today's world. This movie makes a strong suggestion about ""hanging in there"" in a ""complicated"" marriage. (What loving marriages worth keeping is not somewhat complicated)?
The story brings up suggestions why a couple should remain married and not the quick and easy out because things don't go ""quite right"".
Again it is touched by Christian/Spirituality and interjecting a connection that belongs in a marriage rather than--""we can always get a divorce""....
Regarding the see through night gown---I played this movie in slow motion more than once and never saw the 'see through' part. I did see a woman's slip or other type of of cover up under the blue night gown. Never was there any offense to what she was wearing, nor did I see anything that a child or an adult watching this movie.",1272153600,97,845,4.794520547945205

4061636,4,B0032LV4KY,"""A couple facing difficult marital issues tries to escape for a few days in Mexico, only to have their SUV break down, stranding them in the town of Dommatina. However, as the couple and the town residents warm to each other, it becomes apparent that they' "" is all the Editorial blurb says. The description just leaves you hangin'.

The stars IN the ""FAITH'n'FAMILY"" movie stars people---one of which is one of Cheech'n'Chong---you wouldn't expect to see in a FAITH-
based movie, but it didn't exclude this from the FAMILY-category.

THIS man---IN his sixties---that actually remembers portions OF the 'sixties, enjoyed this film, as did my youngish, 59-year-old wife. I'm
sorry that ONE reviewer hated it because THE PREIST never used the word J=E=S=U=S in the course of the movie. Jesus! Give me a break...
there!
===> I <=== used the word TWICE, okay?

There is nothing offensive in this movie; no nudity; no violence; no kidding!",1435276800,4,934,4.936305732484076
4061637,5,B0032LV4KY,I really like this Hallmark movie it's good it's clean got low romance low comedy the actors was really good would I recommend this one yes if I have to give it a rating of five stars I would give it five stars rating.,1434585600,,218,3.977272727272727
4061638,4,B0032LV4KY,"Donna (Teri Polo) and Pete (Jason Priestley) Stanhope, a young professional couple, are going thru a very rough patch in their marriage. Turns out, the biggest saint in this movie may well be Pete's boss who senses something is wrong with his employee and promptly puts him on holiday and offers him the use of his time share beach house in San Marcos, Mexico. Enroute to San Marcos, the Stanhopes take a wrong turn and end up, lost and irritated, in the sleepy town of Dommatina. And because this is a Hallmark movie, it's only natural that the town's annual festival looms near. Donna and Pete rapidly learn that the townsfolk of Dommatina are the sort who provide services out of kindness and who adamantly refuse tips. That's my kind of town, and one that I doubt exists outside of the Hallmark universe. Oh, cynical me.

Expecting A Miracle (2009) is a faith-based movie, but don't let that scare you. It's a good movie and a touching movie. It presents a story where, early on, you're guessing whether the happy ending will manifest courtesy of an actual miracle or of natural events. Anyway, in their stranded week (give or take) in Dommatina, the Stanhopes are impacted positively by the community and soon land smack dab in the middle of the town's preparation for the impending fiesta. And, gazing at that shaky aerial-harness that's so pivotal in the town festivities, maybe Pete's engineering background will come in handy (and maybe it won't).

It's a  narrative that wears its heart on its sleeve. It spits at the cynic's heart. Who would've thunk it thirty years ago that Cheech Marin would be playing roles like this and getting away with it? He plays Dommatina's beloved priest, Father Arturo, whose awesome quote I jotted down with a full intention to recite to folks whenever I want to show off my sagacity: ""At first, do what is necessary. And then, do what is possible. And, suddenly, you will be doing the impossible."" That's truth, babe.

Priestley still looks young enough that you may have to jerk yourself away from thinking of him as Brandon Walsh from Beverly Hills, 90210. He and Teri Polo (a personal fave of mine) make this improbable story work. And I say ""improbable"" because these people in Dommatina really are too good to be true. And the stuff that happens in the end... Listen, by then, the movie had gotten to me, and I was too wrapped up in what was happening to try to punch holes in the story. I was just happy that, at least in this one case, good things do happen to good people. But, okay, really, only Hallmark can pull off trotting out a peppy crippled little boy (Kevin Hernandez) who hopes to walk normally again, courtesy of the local saint. But maybe he should talk to Pete's boss.",1433635200,,2732,4.650103519668737

4061681,1,B0032LV4KY,"This movie did not meet my expectations at all. It is clean without bad words and the main characters are really sweet and likable. However, this is NOT a Christian movie. The miracle that takes place is by a Saint and the name of Jesus is never used at all. I was not able to let my children watch this because I didn't want them confused. Even in the Bible when saints performed miracles it was always in the name of Jesus. This is a feel good movie but has no real impact for Christ. We always try to spend our time on things that honor our Lord and I did not feel like this movie did that. I was disappointed that none of the other reviewers mentioned this and that I wasted my money on this DVD so I'm putting this review on here to help other Christian parents. For Christians I highly recommend Facing the Giants, The Encounter, Courageous, Fly Wheel,  Fireproof, In the Blink of an Eye, Brother White, Hidden Secrets, WWJD, Seasons of Gray, What if, God's Not Dead, Road to Emmaus, Secrets of Jonathan Sperry, Lukewarm, I am Gabriel.

4061796,4,B0032LV4KY,"This 89-minute Hallmark movie from 2009 is based on Ira Avery's short story ""The Miracle of Dommatina,"" but changes the Italian setting to a Mexican one. Jason Priestley and Teri Polo play a Los Angeles couple in their late 30s whose marriage becomes strained when they are unable to have children. Accepting an offer from his engineering boss to take a week at his time-share in Mexico, they get stranded in the tiny village of Dommatina, where they get involved in a festival honoring the local saint. Cheech Marin plays the Catholic priest who organizes the annual festival.

Like most Hallmark TV films, this movie is a feel-good program romanticizing the goodness of people and the intervention of God in their lives, sometimes excessively so. These people don't live in the real world, but in a strange paradise where everyone is kind and generous to fellow human beings, and all the usual cliches are in evidence. Nevertheless, the sentimental style works really well here, and it's one of the better-acted films from this genre. You might find yourself enjoying it more than you might expect.",1400112000,6,1100,4.945945945945946

4061812,5,B0032LV4KY,"Shown on British television as the Miracle at Dommatina, this movie is essentially an essay on the need to preserve the good things in your life, by taking time to focus on what matters. It is a charming story about a stressed out couple of young L.A. executives whose vehicle breaks down in the middle of Mexican nowhere on the way to take a holiday that they've been sent on to restore themselves.
They wind up in a small, fairly cut off Mexican village where the pace of life forces them to slow down and re-evaluate themselves. They are taken in hand by the village mechanic and his family, and by the Priest, (Cheech Marin) who, when unravelling their emotional problems, has a slight air of Columbo about him. Kevin Hernandez will steal your heart as the boy at the centre of the ostensible miracle of Dommatina.",1391558400,17,818,4.571428571428571

4061816,4,B0032LV4KY,I purchased this movie since I like the actors in it. The story was cute but lacked any depth. The characters sometimes seemed like their hearts weren't in it. I will watch it again. It will be a once a year movie for me. It does have a happy ending.,1389139200,,250,4.02

And the thing we liked best was ""visiting"" a Mexican village and having an adventure there. It was one of those places you'd love to be yourself. Highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy these things. And, as expected, the ending was not completely predictable.

Worlds cleanest city is a rural town in Mexico that Jason presley hacks his emotionless face through to sacrifice his car repair to let a crippled boy pretend to fly.

4061896,3,B0032LV4KY,"Although this movie has a lot of big name actors, and they are normally pretty good in other films/shows, their acting was not up to par in this one. There wasn't a flow to it, they weren't convincingly portraying their charactes and they didn't mesh with each other.  This movie really felt like they were trying too hard to make it a good movie.  The movie was middle of the road in both storyline and acting.  The story went in many directions and often left some things out that might have contributed to the flow of the story.  The plot is pretty easily figured out quite early along in the movie.  The overall theme is taking life slowly and enjoying the moment and what you have.

The main couple are having a hard and disappointing time getting pregnant.  They each blame themselves, and sometimes each other, until they are at the breaking point.  They take a vacation during which along the way they break down and never reach their final destination.  However, it is the time they spend in this sleepy little town that brings them closer together in the end.  The title ""Expecting a Miracle"" comes from the yearly celebration of the St. who grants miracles and the little boy who thinks it is his turn to receive that miracle.

The movie didn't really impress me.  Cheech was not cast as a funny comedian, but in a more serious role this time. The story took forever to unfold and there were too  many unrealistic and obvious things happening which detracted from the storyline.  The movie dabbles with infertility, pregnancy, getting pregnant, having children, adoption, etc.  There is also discussion of miracles taking place and a child relying on a miracle of his own so that he can walk normal again.

As far as having a clean movie to watch without the language and sex, this one will fit the bill.",1307923200,,1815,4.607476635514018

It does have a ""Hallmark"" feel to it but the acting by both of the leads is quite good. I was a big Beverly Hills 90210 fan during its heyday and when I read that Jason Priestley was starring in the movie my curiosity was piqued. Teri Poli, whom i'd never heard of before, gave a wonderfully believable performance of a frustrated barren wife. Overall it is a good, bordering on great, family movie that is appropriate for all ages. Tell Hollywood we need more movies like this one.",1291161600,31,575,4.383177570093458
