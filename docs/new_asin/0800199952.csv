8078889,1,0800199952,"I want to love this film, but I don't speak fluent French, and there is no option for English subtitles on this DVD. It's misleading as the Amazon editorial review is in English and the synopsis and review quotes on the DVD box are in English, too.

REALLY WISH I could view this film with subtitles. As it is, it is mostly lost on the non-French speaker.",1344556800,3,355,4.298507462686567
8078890,2,0800199952,"This seems to be a typical French movie: not very much substance, but lots of seeming complexity and sexual deviation treated pretentiously. Lesbianism, transvestitism, suicide, talk of loneliness and fate, philosophy, a policeman who lets off a murderer for no explained reason: you got it all here. Don't the French have normal people? The jumps in time through flashbacks and the many closeups of actors contribute to the effect of trying to look more profound that the movie is. The high point of the movie is the Arab-sounding song played when Nabile drives the car.",1334188800,,571,5.021052631578947
8078891,1,0800199952,"Unfortunately this DVD-R apparently does not come with subtitles. As this is a french-language production, and I understand few French words apart from place names and food references, this creates a bit of a problem.  I contacted the manufacturer (Columbia Classics Video) with this problem, and I was told repeatedly that this was available in 'French only'. I really am not sure that the person I was corresponding with understood the concept of subtitles, but at this time I am left with the conclusion that English subtitles are not available with this.",1302739200,14,558,5.065217391304348
8078892,5,0800199952,"`Les Voleurs' is a film so layered you really have to watch it a few times in order to understand and fully appreciate it.

Some have called director Andre Techine `uneven', but of the three films I've seen from him (`Ma Saison Preferee', `Les Roseaux Sauvages' and `Lew Voleurs') I consider all three to be stellar, all three would make my personal ballots for Best Picture in their respective years, and `Les Roseaux Sauvages' (`The Wild Reeds') would land on my `Top 100 Films of All Time' list (currently compiling).

I think it's safe to say that I really like Techine's work.

`Les Voleurs' is probably the most intricately constructed of the three films I've seen, but all together it is probably my least favorite (which isn't saying a lot, since, as I've stated, it would make my `best of the year' ballot).  The film has facets of many different film genres (the noir, the family drama, the crime thriller, the romance) and it uses them all to construct a tale that twists and unravels at a pace allowing for a gradual build of suspense, which works beautifully for the film.  As layers are stripped away and intentions and motives and actions and relationships are uncovered, developed and shattered, `Les Voleurs' maintains its hold on our attention marvelously.

This is thanks in large part to the cast, all of which are outstanding.  Daniel Auteuil is (once again) a standout for me.  As Alex, the black sheep of a pretty `black' family.  I love the intensity he brings to his character, a full sense of disilutionment as he tries to grapple with the actuality of his current situation.  Being a cop in a family steeped in crime, Alex finds himself the social outcast so-to-speak, the one that everyone looked down at because they could feel his subconscious disapproval.  When Alex's brother is murdered he finds that his presence is not welcome because no one really wants his murder solved, at least not by Alex.  When Alex's father winds up dead as well, speculation flies, and Alex's own interests get tangled in a lover named Juliette and her lover, an aged professor named Marie (yes, a woman).

As Alex develops a relationship with Marie the films tone shift slightly to allow for a philosophical spin on the proceedings, which in my opinion only add another layer of masterful delivery to this wonderfully crafted film.

With so much going on, and so many obvious directions taken, `Les Voleurs' is surprisingly grounded and thus brilliantly executed.

It feels complete.

Like I said, this is a film you really need to see multiple times to fully appreciate.  The way Techine layers the film by jumping through time to build the story gradually makes it pertinent that the audience pay close attention.  This is not just your typical crime story or murder mystery; this is a multi-faceted character study that weaves pure tension and suspense into it's tightly woven structure.  With stunning performances by Auteuil (I wish I could rightfully claim this an ensemble and give him the `Supporting Actor' award this year, but a large part of me feels he is undoubtedly `Lead'), Deneuve (brilliant performance), Cote (stunning, intoxicating) and Didier Bezace (creepy in that `he's my brother' kind of ways), `Les Voleurs' is a journey worth taking...

...again and again and again!",1260144000,5,3304,4.887096774193548
8078893,3,0800199952,"Deneuve is in a subdued role in this film.  She's also in a supporting role so the film cover is a bit misleading.  The story is not as strong as others that she's chosen.
Daniel Auteuil is great as the cop who is entangled in the life of a trouble-making young woman.  Extremely sexy in this role, he plays the role of a strong yet conflicted law enforcer well.
The film is a bit weak in its flow.  It's not the worst film but it's also not extremely good either.",1084924800,7,464,4.122222222222222
8078894,5,0800199952,"Les Voleurs is an excellently acted, directed, and written film.  This is Auteuil's finest acting to date.  Furthermore, the film is the best example  of the use of deconstructivism in film making.  Les Voleurs is the reason  why I believe the French are still the best film makers today.  Just a  warning to younger viewers.  Some scenes can be disturbing.",941241600,10,357,4.833333333333333
