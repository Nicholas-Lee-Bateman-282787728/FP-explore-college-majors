7733215,1,B01E8432BC,"This is the second time that I had to write how outrageous the videos are.  One story is how Oscar is a prince and the story line goes into a joke based upon the Gospel of St. Matthew 7:6  and by this Oscar is making fun upon a statement that Our Lord made.
Sesame St. advertises that it helps kids to be kind; but when you get down to it when one makes blasphemy against another's religion that is a hate crime. Into the garbage this goes.  I wish Jim Henson was alive, he produced higher class videos.",1467849600,2,503,4.112244897959184
