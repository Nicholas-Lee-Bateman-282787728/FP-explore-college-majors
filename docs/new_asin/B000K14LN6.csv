8153757,5,B000K14LN6,"The only problem with the Davenport films is that there are only a handful that are appropriate for children.  Rapunzel, The Frog King, and Hansel and Gretel are wonderful.  However, Ashpet has the stepmother using profanity and there is a squeamish relationship between one of the stepsisters and the stepfather.  Snow White has a dark scene where the faithful servant stabs himself to please and serve the stepmother.  There are just too many dark adult moments in many of these interpretations. The tellings are well done and no doubt authentic to versions of the original- in plot rather than setting- but they are not for young children.",1349481600,,642,4.97196261682243
