8502650,4,B006P7R74E,"I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one Luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1397260800,,2213,4.508728179551122
8502651,5,B006P7R74E,"As good as the first season. Maybe even better because the charcters evolved, thus the intrigue . You discover what ""democracy"" means for the Danes, how much a damage such a position for a woman may do to her family life, you learn what balancing government duties and family obligations mean and you continue to ask yourself if power is not the grain of distruction in the name of a ""great good""",1372032000,3,396,4.513888888888889
8502652,5,B006P7R74E,"Hard to compare this with anything I have seen. Sophisticated, really wonderfully acted, complex and beleivable story, quality from start to end. Want to spend quality time with your tv this is the way to go.",1370131200,3,208,4.805555555555555
8502653,5,B006P7R74E,"... you'll love 'Borgen'!  A truly fascinating fictional account of Denmark's first female Prime Minister, 'Borgen' has wonderful characters and excellent plots.  It is worth buying a region-free DVD player to watch this terrific series.",1363737600,2,237,5.742857142857143
8502654,5,B006P7R74E,"I've been watching this series online in the U.S. and it is AMAZING.

After Season 1 I didn't think it could get better but it did. I thought the opening episode of Season 2 (the Afghanistan episode) was a bit disappointing --  clich'd, which this series rarely is. But after that it hit its stride. The actors are all marvelous -- so believable in their roles. I have heard this called a Danish West Wing. Well, I love West Wing and always will, but Borgen is far more sophisticated and believable.

I really really hope Season Three will make it to the U.S.",1362182400,2,559,4.407766990291262
8502655,5,B006P7R74E,"Riveting, is the word used for the first season of 'Borgen'. Season Two of 'Borgen' is just as riveting, only better,so much better.  Sidse Babett Knudsen as the Prime Minister of Denmark has learned the tough lessons for a first term, now,she is tougher, better prepared and an about to be divorced woman. This second term is a tough year.

Nyborg has learned how to take power from a bunch of male politicians who refer to her as ""Mommy"" whenever she leaves the room. Nyborg, does a lot of brilliant things, and it seems she is at the top of her game. Nyborg and her husband have separated, her children feel alone, her daughter develops an anxiety that is difficult to control, and Nyborg has no one to talk to. Her close mentor had a stroke and she had to fire him. Her spin doctor, Kasper, played by Pilou Asbaek is meeting his devilish childhood head on, his off and on girlfriend, Katrine Fosmark, played by Birgitte Hjort Sorensen, moves from one job to another to find her ethical boundaries. Everyone seems to be in flux, everyone has an edge, everyone is trying to find themselves.

However, each episode finds that Nyborg is becoming stronger, more able to meet her detractors head on. She is still alone, her daughter in trouble, but things are about to come to a head. What we learn is that life is about compromise, political, personal, public and private. Nyborg blames herself for her daughter's problems, the marriage issues, and is now trying to look to the future to see what lays ahead. She has proved her mettle, and shown her colleagues that she is a true Prime Minister, in word and deed.

This is one of the best political series on either side of the big pond. It is a must see for everyone.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-30-13",1359504000,10,1756,4.576433121019108
8502656,5,B006P7R74E,"This is a nice series with a intelligent plot, good cast and beautiful scenes of Copenhagen. It has interesting and well developed characters who are also appealing people.",1355443200,3,172,5.178571428571429
8502657,3,B006P7R74E,"Bought this political drama series through the second season largely based on recommendations that if I enjoyed the Danish crime series Forbrydelsen I would enjoy this as well.  Also, it received some good reviews across The Pond.  While the first season was good, and the acting and and production values excellent, the second season devolved quickly into primarily a relational melodrama, as do so many initially well done series here in the US.  Some, as with an earlier reviewer, will enjoy this, but for me, the series has already lost its interest, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for genuine political drama or meatier fare than the bourgeois plights and gripes of this series protagonists in season two.",1351468800,2,726,4.983471074380165
8502658,5,B006P7R74E,"The second season (episodes 11 to 20) of Borgen screened between September and November 2011 in Denmark and commanded an average 53% audience share for DR1. Borgen revolves around Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg Christensen (Sidse Babett Knudsen), her media adviser Kasper Juul (Pilou Asbk) and journalist Katrine Fnsmark (Birgitte Hjort Srensen) and the struggles in their private and professional lives.
Sidse Babett Knudsen is even more astounding than in series 1. Hearing her character Birgitte speak in English from episode 11 was an absolute joy. As the series commences with episode 11, we see Birgitte in Afghanistan and debating whether or not Danish troops should remain in the country. More backstabbing back in Copenhagen follows with the selection of a new European commissioner. There's infighting at the very top of the Labour Party leading to a swift removal of their leader. This particular storyline had traces of actual events in UK politics involving Jacqui Smith's husband's viewing habits and the downfall of Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.
For those who have seen The Killing - Season 1 and Borgen - Season 1 you'll be happy to see that Sren Malling is back as TV1 news editor Torben Friis, although his appearances are less than in the first series. Bjarne Henriksen also returns in his role as Defence Minister. The Killing - Season 2 fans will be pleased to see Mikael Birkkjr continue his role as Philip Christensen as well as Benedikte Hansen returning as journalist Hanne Holm. Birkkjr's appearances are less than in the first season.
Borgen Series 2 ensures that DR's (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) tradition of making quality drama continues. There are fine performances from all the regulars and guest stars too. Lars Brygmann is one of Denmark's finest actors and he is fantastic as Labour minister Troels H&ouml;xenhaven. For me though Sidse Babett Knudsen really is the star of the show. Luckily series 3 is already in production in Denmark.
Stand out episodes for me included episodes 11, 13, 17 and 18. As with series 1, the episodes contain many different political strands which seem to have me always wanting the best result for Birgitte.
Similarly to The Killing, Borgen proves that it is not only the UK and USA as the only countries that can produce decent quality drama, Denmark is certainly up there with the big boys.
Looking forward to season 3!!

Enjoy!",1327190400,25,2413,5.07808564231738
