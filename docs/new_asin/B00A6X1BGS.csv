I was born in South Dakota, and ""educated"" in SD and Minnesota, and this is the first I had ever heard of the 38+2 that were executed in Mankato.

5390708,5,B00A6X1BGS,As a Native American I cried through the whole movie. Tears of joy that we are seeking healing and hope for our Native family and tears of saddness for our ancestors that had to endure such atrocities. May the Creator bring healing to all those who watch this movie. Thank you to all who make this ride each year.,1387584000,11,313,4.322033898305085

5390730,5,B00A6X1BGS,"So much has been hidden from us,about the real history of this country,much of it very shameful.
If it was all turned around ,makes you wonder how we would all react?

5390733,5,B00A6X1BGS,"Excellent documentary of the origins of the ride, the history behind it (sadly something I've only recently become aware of even though I only live about an hour from the site) along with the personal stories of some of the riders and those who helped them along the way. I'll definitely be looking for ways to help for a future ride.",1445817600,,334,4.491803278688525
5390734,4,B00A6X1BGS,Wonderful film documentary. This shows how people coming together can make something meaningful happen. This moving film needs to be seen by many more. Very healing.,1445644800,,165,5.384615384615385

5390736,4,B00A6X1BGS,I liked the fact that this was a true story.,1442361600,,44,3.5
5390737,5,B00A6X1BGS,"Something every white and red person should watch. It was stunning to find out Mr. Lincoln wasn't as concerned about the red man as much as he was for the black man. True the black man was brought here without his consent. However this was the red man's land and we, the white, took it from him without his consent, done through lies, broken treaties, wars, where many good people of both races paid a high price. Their lives.  This story is one very few knew about. Me for one. It's an eye opener.",1441929600,,498,4.297872340425532
5390738,5,B00A6X1BGS,A very moving documentary and how the healing is started for members of the tribe during the ride. I loved it and if you're native american or a lover of history..buy this.,1441843200,,172,4.40625
5390739,4,B00A6X1BGS,"This is an interesting movie about a real event. I live in Minnesota so learned much about the history of the events in the 1860s and why it was so important to participate in this modern day trek. I was impressed with how well planned the trip was and how the participants overcame the problems of weather, logistics and dealing with their own feelings.",1435363200,,354,4.546875
5390740,5,B00A6X1BGS,A friend let me watch her copy of this film and I was blown away. I am a member of the Cherokee Nation and I knew nothing about this. If you want to see humanity at it's best and want to learn the truth of what the Native Americans really went through and still go through watch this film!!! Be sure to have a tissue near by. I rarely give any movie 5 stars but this is truly deserving!,1430784000,2,386,3.8987341772151898
5390741,5,B00A6X1BGS,A beautiful memorial that many more people should watch and be aware of.,1430524800,2,72,4.615384615384615

5390744,5,B00A6X1BGS,Inspiring cultural response to the misdeeds of the powerful. A quite different window on President Abraham Lincoln.,1427587200,2,115,5.823529411764706
5390745,5,B00A6X1BGS,I enjoyed this documentary because it was about the true history. I don't agree with how the US punished 38 Native americans at one during the late1800s the things you don't read about in the history books in school.,1425427200,2,216,4.564102564102564
5390746,5,B00A6X1BGS,After finding out about some of the history that was not covered in the text books I was curious to see what the Native Americans had to say. This was inspiring and uplifting. I gave the DVD to a Headmistress from France after we viewed it together. She wanted to share it with her family and students in France. I met a couple of the young riders...girls under the age of 11. I would like to think I am that tough but not sure I could endure what they do on the ride.,1424649600,2,468,4.043010752688172

5390749,5,B00A6X1BGS,"The movie was very informative and it happened to arrive on December 26th. The shipping and handling price of just 2,92 is a good deal. I was wondering if they could do an actual re-enactment of the events in the form of a drama rather than just a documentary.  I also wonder why the group who was victimized has to be the ones to initiate forgiveness.",1419638400,2,352,4.333333333333333
5390764,5,B00A6X1BGS,Very informational and sensitive,1418601600,,32,7.25
5390765,5,B00A6X1BGS,"This really a great documentary. I would highly suggest reading the book ""Over the Earth I Come"" and then watching this film. I grew up in Mankato Minnesota, and while at the University, lived within sight of the execution grounds where 38 out of a planned 303 met their end. Its sad that we didn't get more than a passing mention of the Dakota Wars in our history classes growing up. For good or bad, my home town played a huge role in it,",1418169600,5,440,4.25
5390766,5,B00A6X1BGS,"Ive seen the Dakota 38 documentary three times now. Each time its stirred something in me that has no words, but much emotion. This film is about the Dakota Wokiksuye Memorial Ride first undertaken December 10-26, 2008 and held at the same time each year since.

In 2005 a dream vision came to Jim Miller, a Dakota Vietnam Veteranone so terrible that he tried to forget it. He said you have a sense when something was real and it wouldnt go away. What he saw was a dark occurrence in the name of justice, largely hidden in history and unknown to Jim at the time.

On December 26, 1862 at 10 a.m. in Mankato, Minnesota, 38 Sioux warriors were hung in the public square, the largest mass execution in the history of the US. President Abraham Lincoln ordered it so on December 6. Two more warriors were executed the following year.

With the influx of more whites and military, the Sioux had been herded into a narrow strip of land, not allowed to leave the enclosure or hunt. As part of the treaty they were supposed to receive rations. They didnt. They were starving. To defend themselves, they fought back rather than starve. Atrocities were committed on both sides.

In the opening lines of the film, Jim Miller talks about what it means to be Dakotato walk in harmony with every living thing. Feeling directed by the Creator, he organized a ride on horseback over 330 miles, leaving on December 10, 2008 from Lower Brule, South Dakota to arrive for ceremony at the hanging site in Mankato on December 26. The Memorial Ride was meant to honor the ancestors and as resolution forgiveness. This was not an easy undertaking. There were blizzard conditions to be endured. Participants faced conflicting emotions related to racism, something openly discussed. There were many poignant moments when the riders disclosed why they were riding: for ancestors, family, to lay something to rest within themselves. Communities along the way heard about their mission and helped out, unbidden, by providing food and shelter for the riders and their horses, especially in extreme weather.

The film lends hope, portraying people pulling togethereven in emotional discomfortattempting to heal and overcome horrible tragedies that never should have happened. We need so much more of this today. And such things kept in the dark must be known.",1417478400,13,2327,4.866161616161616
5390767,4,B00A6X1BGS,"Sad, but uplifting at the same time. Please donate to keep this movie free, and spread the word.",1416960000,,96,4.388888888888889
5390768,5,B00A6X1BGS,"Bought this for a Diversity and Incusion event at work. It was a hit. Team members can't stop talking about it. We're in Minnesota and no one knew of this tragedy that occurred right here in our own state, but they were in awe of the bravery of the Native community to apologize for their ancestors parts in the war and  forgive the other side for their wrong doings. This is a lesson we all need in all the tiny wars we face everyday!",1416700800,6,435,4.178571428571429

8547284,1,B00A6X1BGS,"I love history but this video was soooo boring. It was informative for about ten minutes.  66 minutes of it was random people riding horses on a highway, music and a bunch of people reciting jibber jabber. It went from my dvd player strait into the trash.",1521244800,,255,4.425531914893617

8547286,5,B00A6X1BGS,"This was on last night on FNX (First Nations Experience). What a beautiful, emotional and spiritual journey this was. I never heard this story until last night, it made me very angry at first and after I came to peace with it. I was in tears as I watch and listen. I have some Apache blood and this documentary made me feel so much prouder and thankful for my heritage! We are all the Creator's Children and We Need To Stand Together And Be Proud Of Who We Are! Thank you to Jim Miller and the vision you had to make this documentary to be heard and seen. Thank you to everyone who was involved in making this beautiful documentary. To the men, the 38 + 2 who lost their lives. Also at the end of the credits the men and young men that have passed on.
Thanks again for teaching us this story and having this live on for generations. Keep it alive!",1474761600,,847,4.170731707317073

8547289,5,B00A6X1BGS,"This is part of American history that isn't taught in schools along with anything else that would make our government look bad.  Abraham Lincoln ordered the largest mass execution in United States history.  He approved the complete genocide on a scale that makes Hitler look like a sweet little schoolboy.  Why is his face proudly displayed at Mount Rushmore?  Build in the sacred hills of the Lakota Nation it is nothing but a cruel slap in the face!  Why aren't these events taught to our children in History class?  Because the truth would be too traumatizing for them, that's why!  And Columbus Day should be abolished because he never discovered America.  He never went further than the Carribean, that's why!  And how can anyone discover a country that already has millions of inhabitants that lived there for hundreds of years.  Our country tries to paint a pretty picture of our past when it was really a horrific slow torture and starvation of millions of our Native American brothers and sisters, human beings just like us and why?  GREED!!!  The same thing that's driving our country to this day.  I love and respect all of our Veterans from all wars but I'm not proud to be an American anymore forever!  My heart is with my brothers and sisters trying to revive their old cultures and languages.  The fact that it's 2016 and they're still fighting to make our government honor land treaties that were broken and their refusal to return the land to their rightful owners. Lakota, Apache, Cherokee, Choctaw,Sioux,and on and on and on is nothing but a disgrace!  No, after studying the true history about how we stole this country like a pack of greedy crazed animals I respect it no more.  God bless us all",1453248000,,1716,4.723905723905724
