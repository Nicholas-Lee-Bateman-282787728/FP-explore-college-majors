8672520,5,B00MIA0IEI,This is a great movie. It gave me tons of information on Huntington's disease.,1521331200,,78,4.642857142857143
8672521,4,B00MIA0IEI,"definitely a greatly moving film; i really wish they would go more into what Huntington's IS and the science of it (i know not much is known but we're basically told it's a genetic neurological disease that is incurable and devastating ... which I feel like anyone who comes to this film probably already knows?) and perhaps where the research on the illness currently is. I am terrible with names (my apologies to the many heroes in this film!) but the former news correspondent who decided to devote his life to the study of the disease while maintaining positivity was particularly inspiring to me - not only because it actually gave me/us a glimpse into the actual research on the illness but because he offers so much hope in doing so and in being so hopeful and that actually affecting his health in a positive way. I have a terribly difficult time with the many people on here who have decided to have children despite knowing the odds that their kids will have this disease (or the woman whose husband had it and their son died and she is complaining that her husband is not the man she married?? no no no!!!); I know this is not ""PC"" but having a genetic condition myself, I do feel that it is your responsibility as a human being not to inflict suffering on other human beings - my disease is literally NOTHING compared with this and I would never make the CHOICE to even chance inflicting the suffering I've encountered on my worst enemy ... I can't imagine being so selfish to choose to do so with your own children. Adoption people. Adoption. At any rate, the current statuses of the people documented in this film at the end of the film was also really great - it's amazing that so many of them are doing such amazing things with their lives and I cannot say how much respect I have for those who choose to take something so ""negative"" and turn it into a ""positive,"" especially for others who may be facing this illness or who may face it in the future.",1490486400,,1967,4.4515235457063715
8672522,2,B00MIA0IEI,"It was a very interesting subject but it was filmed poorly. The audio sounds like it was recorded in a tin can and they run music over almost everything. It was emotional enough, it didn't need any sweetening for emotion with music (they blare it over conversations sometimes too, making it distracting). My wife and I were pretty astonished about the second story where a woman and man KNEW that the husband had the disease and still had children. We were so annoyed that we stopped watching. The fact that someone would do something just because their 'heart' told them to do it, and just because their heart wants it, is just selfishness. That wasn't the filmmaker's fault, they were just documenting a true story, but it tipped the scales enough to change it to something else.",1485648000,,781,4.708029197080292
8672523,5,B00MIA0IEI,"When Huntington's Disease comes into a family unannounced like it did to my family this documentary really brought light to the subject. Its hard for families dealing with this horrific disease!! Must watch for anyone affected (or not). Nobody understands how this disease works or even that it even exists!! Very great watch, but also brought many tears to my eyes!!",1483315200,,367,5.032786885245901
8672524,5,B00MIA0IEI,"Great movie about Huntington's Disease victims, hard to watch when it effects your own family, but very good.",1426809600,2,109,5.111111111111111
8672525,4,B00MIA0IEI,"This eye-opening documentary is fascinating and hard to watch - often at the same time. Huntington's Disease, once referred to as ""Premature Senility,"" seemed to only be talked about in books or badly portrayed in films (Tony Scotti's laughable turn in the classically bad ""Valley of the Dolls,"" is a good example). ""Alive and Well"" provides much better information - including the frighteningly high chance of inheritance (50%). There are several stories of those affected by the disease: a daughter looking in on her incapacitated Mother, a young woman hoping to start a family, and a drummer in a Country band. The most emotional story is that of Katy Bradley and her family from Washington State. Ms. Bradley's husband Scott (who died in January 2015) inherited the disease from his Father but did not want to get tested. As it turns out, both Scott and his oldest child  are positive for Huntington's and Katy alludes to the possibility that one of their other children may be heading down that road. I was a little taken aback by the Bradley's  bringing 3 children into the world before Scott finally got tested, but that evaporated as the closing scenes of their story show them burying their 6-year old who succumbed to the disease.",1422144000,2,1240,4.872037914691943
