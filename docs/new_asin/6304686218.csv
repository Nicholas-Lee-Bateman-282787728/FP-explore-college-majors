For all the true ""YARDIES/REGGAE FANS"" out there I encourage you to see this  movie, it will bring you a step closer to what some of us have forgotten  over the years. While you are out shopping buy ""Harder they Come""  also.",954547200,,361,4.042253521126761
914763,5,6304686218,I Have seen this movie on cable a few time then i had to buy it on DVD. This Movie to me was not some raunchy reggae movie.  The dancers Danced with some class. They didn't remind me of strippers. I am not a Reggae fan  but this movie got my attention.  The story line was Interesting. It was  kinda supensful to see the outcome. it was kinda hard to follow the dialect  for someone who don't understand the rasta lauange. but after watching the  movie a few time I was able to follow it. So my over all review is its a  GOOD MOVIE :),951523200,,534,3.981132075471698

915103,5,6304686218,My daughter and I love this movie we were hooked the very first time we watched it on cable tv and I knew we had to own it. This movie is funny and exciting it's almost a riot to hear the accents because they are so thick but you can understand them well. The main characters fit perfectly and the story is written and directed perfectly. I love the drama the dancing is fantastic and the music oh my goodness the music is so good you feel like there is a concert in your living room. I sang and danced with Marcia and Olivine I practiced the dance moves and I got pretty good.when I saw Lady Sawin this movie I lost my Mind with joy she is awesome and beanie man was the bomb just to see the singers again in this movie would make me buy it again.

915173,5,6304686218,This was my favorite movie when I was little (clearly a Jamaican). So it's really the nostalgia that got the 5 stars. It's soooo low budget and I love it.!,1359331200,,155,4.2
915174,5,6304686218,"Sometimes, the Jamaican dialect was difficult for me to understand, but I had to give this movie 5 stars based on the plot, the message, and the inspiration. The main character is a single mother/street vendor who starts out as a very unlikeable woman. She's loud, obnoxious, and guilty of practically prostituting her 15-year old daughter to a horny older man who takes an interest in her. Her daughter tells her she hates her, going so far as to accuse her of not caring about her children.

This seems like a turning point in the mother's life. To earn extra money for her family, she begans dancing in the local dance hall. At night, she transforms herself into a dancing diva. Nobody has a clue that she's the sloppy looking street vendor selling beer in the neighborhood. To add to the conflict, she has two evil men who have wronged her (I won't spoil it by saying why).  She shrewdly plays them against each other and uses her charms to eliminate both of them from her life.  In the end, her daughter finds out her secret identity, and she cheers her mom on. This was a story of transformation, redemption, and second chances.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a story with a different twist.",1357862400,,1239,4.5675675675675675
915175,5,6304686218,I love this movie. A jamacia classic. If your into different movies than u just might enjoy this one. Buy it,1355097600,,108,4.190476190476191
915177,5,6304686218,"What more can be said....this an exciting and entertaining look at a cultural phenomenon.  It's got drama, comedy, dancing and a great soundtrack.  We all love a story about a girl next door that breaks out of her familiar to improve life for her home and kids.  We first saw this film on COMCAST ON DEMAND.  And couldn't wait for it to come again as they play it Jan/Feb ever year.  We bought it from Amazon recently and watch it at weekly.

915211,2,6304686218,This movie was definitely produced under sub-standard conditions.  The determination of the main character is admirable but the plot tends to be a bit unbelievable.,1275955200,2,164,5.56
915213,4,6304686218,If you can get past the Jamaican slang and accent then you can get into this movie. The dancehall scenes are hot and made the movie for me. The movie is dated since it came out in 1997. You will laugh when you see the cell phones. However it was pretty fun movie to watch.,1272240000,,272,3.963636363636364
915214,5,6304686218,"This movie was so much fun. It contained several themes like the loss of innocence, the psychological effects from bullying, and the escape from oppressive spritis. What was must amusing to me was watching the main character transform herself from a struggling street vendor to a queen to better herself and her children's lives, momentarily. The music is great, the cameos by reggae artists are great, and the evil character with the red top... oh I just wanted to mash 'em.",1271203200,,475,4.8765432098765435

It's a rags to a little riches movie;-) or a Jamaican version of Cinderella without the prince haha. Anyway, I'm a Jamaican, live in US now but I rate this movie high! You won't be disappointed, just listen to the messages. The quality of this DVD is great, no problems. The packaging isn't as fancy as more higher budget movies.",1261526400,,471,4.363636363636363

915217,5,6304686218,I liked the story line. The character that played the mother of two young girls and raising them the best way she could without a father and having her teen age daughter sleep with a man she knew was too old for her so that she could get an education and was able to change things for the better for her and her children was enlightning. This was actually a movie I wouldn't have watched but it wasn't so bad.,1215129600,,409,4.125
915218,5,6304686218,"As a Jamaican American (born and raised in JA), I can safely say this is one of the best Jamaican-themed movies ever!

This movie touches on many issues that exist in Jamaica up until today.",1188086400,,367,4.140845070422535

915220,5,6304686218,"I love Dancehall Queen!  I lost my first copy (VHS) so I replaced it with a new copy in DVD.  I never get tired of watching this movie and I consider it a Jamaican movie classic right up there with Harder They Come, Rockers and Smile Orange.  It is a nice twist on the traditional rags-to-riches story.  Although her character's morals are somewhat questionable (she practically ""sells"" her daughter to a high-paying local don), you can't help but root for the protagonist Marcia!",1169769600,2,480,4.746987951807229

915351,5,6304686218,"Wow!! Yes, mon. One of the best films to come out of Jamaica, seen. Obviously made by the same folks who gave us THIRD WORLD COP. Some of the same great actors are in this too. I liked that film, but this one is better. A single woman named Marcia with two kids and her brother, Junior get mixed up with the rude bwoy element on the tough streets of Kingston. The only way this woman can free herself from the hopelessness of poverty, murder, revenge, and pedophilia is to become a scantily clad Boogle dancer. To win a man? Or to win fame and money? I'm not quite sure. You see, this flick is filled with fast talking heavy Jamaican Patois which makes it hard for a 46 year old white bwoy from Cali to get all in one sitting. Even though, I've been a reggae fan for over 35 years and a dreadie for 12 years. Now, jus' a bal'head.

You might be asking, wha a gwan? What a Boogle, mon? Picture da tall hot black gal dressed inna next-to-nothin' gold lame and a purple wig doing obscene pornographic strip club pole dancing and you get da picture, seen. What next? Full insertion on the dance floor? Rude bwoys gwan luv dis. This film is not for the batty bwoy.

The film is billed as a comedy. And it is funny. But in a demented way.

What a gwan, Star. Audrey Reid as Marcia. Carl Davis as da blood clat rapist. And da great Paul Campbell as da wicked Priest. Also da great Mark Danvers as Madman Junior. Some Golden Bwoy performances, ya know.

If you've never been to Jamaica and want to see how the other half lives, dis film a must see. This is the Third Otherworldy. And if you want to see what's become of Marley's beloved reggae culture, this is a must see. What used to be a music of respect and love has been taken over mostly by slackness(naughtiness), gangster hierarchy, and gun culture. Like misogynistic gangster rap in the States. Only more fun. If you love dancehall reggae, you're gonna love this movie. The music is the cream of crop. The soundtrack and performers are some of the best. And Bennie Man is featured in the film. Him a burn tha place down. If you like this movie you're gonna want the soundtrack. I'm gonna look for it now. I hope it's as good as the THIRD WORLD COP soundtrack.

One thing that did surprise me is that there are no spliffs or hard drugs potrayed at all in this movie. Unusual and not quite reality.

Jamaicans are some of the greatest people on the face of this planet. But this film will show you why Jamaica is not the safest place to take the kids on vacation anymore. A lot of hedonism and bumba clat cocaine don business taking over. Big time!! This is what happens when the poor can't take no more. The movie is pure entertainment and a blast for adults. But, I wouldn't show this to the kids. Me no know if it subtitled. Me jus' a seen it on Black Starz. And it had no close caption.

ENJOY.

915352,5,6304686218,"Violetta was born and raised in a shack in the Australian outback. She never has worn shoes and she talks with a funny accent and odd vocabulary (to no one in particular) because she has always lived alone so she speaks in made up words. She has a slightly broken front tooth, too,(an old bar fight injury that traumatized her and causes her to seem ""simple"")  She wonders what the rest of the world must be like.  One day, a crew of fashion photographers from London show up in the outback with some high fashion models, etc., the whole 9 yards.  Tony St. Swithens Dove (Hugh Grant)is the famous jet setting head cameraman.  He catches a glimpse of violetta squinting at him in the bush while he searches for a spot of necessary privacy for a few minutes.  She thinks he must be an angel, he in his Tommy Hilfigger color-blocked oversize rapper's jacket, pierced eyebrows, anemic chest, and plastic yellow pants (now down around his knees).  Well, I guess the story is sort of predictable from here, but I loved it anyway.  It was so sadly romantic, so depressingly sweetly weepy.  (The first time I saw it I cried so hard that my nose ran all over my tub of extra large jumbo popcorn.) Tony, as you have probably already guessed, ""discovers"" Violetta and brings her back to London, his new discovery that sets the fashion world's teeth on edge.  She becomes the last word in haute couture and makes women all over the world want to have a chipped tooth, too. She also makes Tony's old girlfriend, actress BiBi Wensch, to go completely postal. It becomes de riguer for androgynous males as well as models, to seem ""simple and shoeless, speaking in made up, gutteral sounds.""  Violetta lives with Tony for 364 days and experiences all life has to offer a young sophisticate such as herself.  But, alas, Tony has a short attention span.  I won't get into the gory details, but they get separated at the disco during wet beer bong nite, and never see each other again.  She, well dressed now, kicks off her shoes in the middle of a snowstorm and wanders the earth in search of him, but to no avail.  All kinds of people come up to her and offer her money, houses, cars, food, roller skates, bagpipes, a kitten, some pipe cleaners, themselves even, but alas, she only wants her ""angel"" Tony.  The actress playing Violetta, Audrey Tottingham Hillyard, gives a brilliant performance as an inarticulate model going over the edge in a long soliloquy about ""My Tony Dove, my Tony Luv-Dove, Tony Rub-a-dub-dub-luv-dove, dovey-lovey tone-man, ""me eat off spoon"" and the plaintive, heart wrenching ""...dude?"" Her inarticulateness is stunningly convincing.  In the very last scene, we see Tony, now an old man reminiscing with his young grandson about his travels and his loves.  He squints up at the sky, now quite symbolically cloudy and overcast, and mutters to no one in particular, ""What ever happened to old...unhhh... what's her name?"" They heavens suddenly open up, the rain pours down with a rare ferocity, and the old man gets drenched.  The end.  Incredibly meaningful. Laden with enough symbolic weather changes to make a meteorologist weep like a little girl. I highly recommend this film.",1084492800,,3190,4.746376811594203
915353,5,6304686218,"Unlike most other depictions of Jamaican life and culture, Dancehall Queen is 100 percent pure and authentic Jamaica.  The characters, the dialect, the style, the rhythm and pace of the story are all very real.  If you are of Jamaican heritage or just interested in getting some insight watch this movie.

This is a lighthearted movie that west-indian people can relate to on many levels. It is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them. I have seen this alot. All in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain. There is good music, dance and jokes cant done. Latah.",988848000,,612,4.572727272727272

When a seemingly unrelated incident sets off a tragic chain of events  that leaves her good  friend Sonny dead and her  brother Junior scared for his life, Marcia realizes that she  must take matters into her own hands.
Set in the fascinating  world of the Kingston dancehall scene (with a side trip into the  go-go racket), the movie is truly a girl-power fairytale  with a West Indian edge.
