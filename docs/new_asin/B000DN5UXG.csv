2475014,5,B000DN5UXG,"The concert grooves pretty hard.  A big negative is its too short.  There should be a lot more footage and songs than whats in the DVD, but it's a lot better than not having anything at all.",1370908800,4,190,4.108108108108108
2475015,5,B000DN5UXG,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS CONCERT DVD. LOVED NILE RODGERS COMMENTARY ON IT & HIS PLAYING WITH & TRIBUTE TO BERNARD EDWARDS. THE CHIC GIRLS, SISTER SLEDGE  & SLASH WERE HOT.  THEY TOOK US BACK TO THE DAYS OF GREAT ARTISTS, PERFORMANCES & MUSIC.  GREAT VIDEO & SOUND QUALITY.  WE PARTYED HARDY ON THIS ONE.",1364169600,2,300,4.60377358490566
2475016,4,B000DN5UXG,"This concert is LIVE! Nile Rodgers & Bernard Edwards weeve funky guitar fueled classics like Good Times, Freak Out, We are Family & He's the Greatest Dancer (w Sister Sledge), and other Chic classics. These guys sound better than the actual recordings & most of the songs performed are the 12in versions. Sad note but this was the last concert performed by Bernard Edwards, whom passed away a few days later from an illness. If your into disco/party/dance music, this is a classic!",1296432000,5,481,4.807228915662651

8102482,5,B000DN5UXG,"Purchased this for a very good friend of mine who is a big fan of the group. This particular dvd was very special to him because when this was recorded, Bernard Edwards the bass player was literally dying. True to his love of the music and to the group, he played his guitar for the whole concert with very little movement but unfortunately went to his dressing room afterward, laid down and passed away. He had never let on how really sick he was. So this dvd is priceless. My friend still thanks me every time he watches it.",1480118400,,526,4.3232323232323235

8102486,4,B000DN5UXG,"It's Chic, what can I say ? Actually it's Chic, Sister Sledge and Steve Winwood puts in an appearance. As does Slash. I could have done without Slash, not my favorite guitarist. Up until then it's what you'd expect, exquisite vocals, great guitar and bass, the whole band is rather wonderful. Worth every penny. Yowsah Yowsah Yowsah !",1410480000,,334,4.775862068965517
