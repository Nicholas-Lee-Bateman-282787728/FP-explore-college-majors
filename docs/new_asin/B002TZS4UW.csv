3986704,1,B002TZS4UW,Artie must be trying to milk every dollar while Stern is still on the air. There's nothing new here same old stuff we all heard time and time again. Sorry Artie but this is getting old.,1260403200,12,185,4.166666666666667
3986705,5,B002TZS4UW,"I love the Stern show and Artie.

This was a riot to watch, very natural comic.",1259971200,4,79,3.9375
3986706,1,B002TZS4UW,Dont bother with this dvd. I love the stern show and arte but this was a miss. i think i chuckled once or twice but thats it. i was hoping to be hystericaly laughing but this didn't do it. arte is better in the stern show. i couldn't even watch the whole dvd cuz it was just so painful. sorry art.,1259884800,4,297,3.8852459016393444
8380811,5,B002TZS4UW,Artie Lange's best recorded concert. Hysterical! This is a must-have for any Howard Stern or Artie Lange fan. One puzzling thing: why the hell is Bob Levy on the cover? This is Artie Lange's CD and Levy is not even one of the featured supporting acts in the bonus features...Whatever. Just ignore this fact and enjoy.,1377475200,,317,4.678571428571429
8380812,3,B002TZS4UW,"Artie is somewhat funny in this video.  Don't expect to be rolling on the floor though.  The production value is very low and the choice of locations, being a tiny club, to do the video is questionable.  Perhaps a little more thought into the making of this video would have been good.  That is a lot to ask, knowing that Artie's main concern was his next hit of heroin.",1368576000,,370,4.318840579710145
8380813,5,B002TZS4UW,Artie has fun picking on himself and others and keeps you laughing. Highly recommend this if you are a Stern fan or not.,1357689600,2,120,4.260869565217392
8380814,1,B002TZS4UW,"I wouldn't love Artie if I didn't buy this and this was the worst waste of money I've ever spent. I don't think there was one joke that wasn't heard and at better length on the stern show or ""The whiskey talking"" I cant believe they even released this. Watching is depressing and I haven't finished watching it since seeing it one time.",1281744000,3,336,4.349206349206349
8380815,1,B002TZS4UW,"Artie is funny, but if you have ""It's the Whiskey Talkin"", then you have seen this.

Bob Levy is an AWFUL comedian, awful awful awful.  He is bad bad bad.",1273190400,7,154,4.1
8380816,2,B002TZS4UW,"I am a big Artie fan. I loved his It's the Whiskey Talkin' dvd and his book, Too Fat Too Fish. Those were great, you got the feeling he really enjoyed doing both. This, well, it's old tired material, and it looks like he is battling depresion and urges to use drugs the entire time. He is way off here. It's too bad, Artie is a talented guy when he has his act together.",1271289600,2,370,4.013513513513513
8380817,1,B002TZS4UW,"I have seen Artie just a few times but have heard every joke here multiple times. Dated material, painfull to watch at times.",1267315200,5,125,4.478260869565218
8380818,1,B002TZS4UW,"Artie is such a talented guy, as evidenced by his stint on the Howard Stern show, yet this DVD is a complete clunker.  It feels like he's just going through the motions, jumping from flat joke to flat joke.  And, frankly, if you've been listening to the Howard Stern show, you've heard most of these jokes before, which makes the DVD feel like even more of a rip-off.

Although I'd love to, I can't give the DVD any more than 1 star.",1263945600,5,433,4.2560975609756095
8380819,2,B002TZS4UW,"I've been a fan since Dirty Work, listen to Stern everyday, like Beer League, bought Too Fat To Fish, etc.

So I am a fan, but I didn't enjoy this. I've heard about 90% of these jokes before on Letterman and Stern over and over. This DVD felt rushed. Like he just wanted to get something out quick, so he compiled his go to list of coke/whore jokes.

He's such a witty guy, I'm surprised he didn't write much new material for this special.

I'll be on the look out in the  future for new material.

Oh, and Levy on the  cover struck me as bizarre.

Check out It's The Whiskey Talking, Too Fat To Fish, or listen to Artie on  Stern. I love him in those forms.",1262390400,14,658,4.0859375
8380820,1,B002TZS4UW,Listen to Stern and youve heard these jokes a 1000 times....very BORING.....many in the audienece with just a grin or such on their face......BAD,1261785600,8,145,5.083333333333333
