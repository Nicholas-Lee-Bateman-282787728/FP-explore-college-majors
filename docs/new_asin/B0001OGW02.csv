2021490,5,B0001OGW02,a truly tragicocomic tale of a displaced traditional sister adrift in the tumultuous epoch of changes which overtook many American Roman Catholic religious communities in the raging wake of Vatican II. Ms Pleshette is a veritably peripathetic protagonist searching for a relevant and conventual identity amid the vicissitudes of her fluid circumstance.  the technical parameters of this dvd are remarkable.,1091404800,6,406,5.766666666666667
8015526,5,B0001OGW02,"Cute movie, even with Suzanne Pleshette, who I don't care a bunch for. It's pretty clean despite the initial career of Dixie, though it has the requisite scene of bikini stuffers for the shot of skin some seem to need in their entertainment. The acting is good. The dialog not too bad. The scenery is pretty. It's a nice story revealing our connectedness as community and world citizens, i.e., what hurts or diminishes one hurts or diminishes all.",1517702400,,447,4.743589743589744

A story of love, grace, and forgiveness, how the two minds come together for the good of the convent.  The setting New Orleans and the Louisiana country side.

8015528,3,B0001OGW02,"Were it not for Suzanne Pleshette and Cloris Leachman, this would be a lame excuse for a movie.  Acting is bad.  Plot is on the absurd side.",1490400000,,140,4.148148148148148
8015529,5,B0001OGW02,"loved this old movie.  I saw it when it first came on to TV and never had the chance to see it again.  These two women were made for their parts and sorry they never made any other films together.  Really good clean story, and funny in parts, but has depth throught out.",1456617600,,270,4.056603773584905

8015535,3,B0001OGW02,"Nuns and hookers -- the perfect combination for this silly TV comedy movie about Dixi, owner of a bordello who is convicted by a judge to be in the custody of Sister Eugenio and Sister Agnes at the convent. Of course, lifestyles clash and lessons are to learned by all before the sentence is up.

The cast is good, and the DVD offers a few laughs in this escapist comedy.",1198800000,9,371,4.3
