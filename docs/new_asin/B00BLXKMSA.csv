8570656,5,B00BLXKMSA,"Why Time-Life didn't put this disc in The Ultimate Collection I'll never know. Three more first-rate episodes. If you have all the other Burnett Show releases and you overlooked this one, get it. If you don't, get it anyway. You'll be glad you did!",1412208000,6,248,4.659090909090909
8570657,1,B00BLXKMSA,"I was quite disappointed.  There was a minimum number of skits.  Much of most disks were talking and variety shows.  It seemed that I was paying about $10.00 per skit.  I would not. Purchase any more DVD ,s of this nature and would not recommend them to others.",1390867200,2,261,4.375
8570658,5,B00BLXKMSA,I liked this disc as well as both 'Carol's Favorites' and 'This Time Together (the larger set)'.  The skits are a really funny and the music is good... I watched them with my family and we all had a good time laughing together...  I recommend them wholeheartedly...  :),1381104000,6,269,4.5625
