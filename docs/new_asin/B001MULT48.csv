8321837,5,B001MULT48,"As proud grandparents of a little boy with Down Syndrome, we have been told from before his birth that he will be a blessing that will forever change our lives for the better.  It is hard for the general public to either say or think that they feel sorry for us, for they do not understand the blessing he is.  Yes he brings more work.  Yes we need more patience.  He has accepted his challenges and fights with all his strength every day to move forward.  Our hearts are elated at every little triumph along the way, as his smile penetrates us to our core.

The Child King brings this blessing to life.",1387756800,,603,4.292035398230088
8321838,5,B001MULT48,"I watched this movie with my wife and three kids (ages 14, 12, & 8). We all enjoyed it tremendously, and I highly recommend it as a great addition to any family's holiday movie collection. One of the great things about it, is that while Jeremy has Down Syndrome, his disability is not a central part of the film at all, and is only alluded to a couple of times. Instead the movie is simply about one brother's love for another. Also, like any good fantasy film, there are parts that are clearly ambiguous and not fully-explained and left to the viewer's imagination and interpretation. Despite the fact that the movie was made on a low budget, you'd generally never know it. This is a far superior to most of the big budget ""family entertainment"" at your local megaplex.",1230854400,,770,4.546762589928058
8321839,5,B001MULT48,"I wasn't expecting a lot from the movie, The Child King.  I knew it was made on a shoestring budget, and the only known actor (Lenny Clarke) had only a cameo.  But alas, like Christmast magic, the film quickly grabbed me and my two 6 year old twins and didn't let go until the very end.  The story was funny, heartwarming, and yes, even inspirational.  The older brother in the film, who has Downs Syndrome, was spectacular.  His facial expressions and his sincerity were fantastic.  The little brother, who stops believing in Santa, is a kid who looks wise reminds me of Kevin in the first Home Alone movie, but even better.  He is sure to be a teenage heartthrob some day.  I recommend this movie to everyone.",1229212800,,711,4.5
