1379855,1,B00004Z1FZ,"This has to be the worst production of a movie I have ever seen.  The dubbing is horrible, the sound does not match the characters lips and the voices do not sound like the characters should.  After reading this classic to our children we decided to buy the movie, and boy what a mistake we made with our choice.  I believe the cartoon version would be more realistic and easier to follow.",993168000,4,389,4.375
1379856,1,B00004Z1FZ,"It may be the most accurate version yet filmed, but accurate doesn't necessarily mean entertaining. This very cheap production looks like it was made for Dutch television in 1953. Horrendous dubbing, muddy grainy picture and atrocious editing make this one nearly unwatchable. At a ponderous 135 minutes, you'll wish you were dead long before it's over. The complete lack of any familar names in the credits should be a tip-off; despite the so-called ""co-production"" with MGM/UA, no American studio would ever release this. Don't trust the 1999 release date; it truly appears to have been filmed on 16mm in the 1970s.
***Addendum:  A check of the Internet Movie Database reveals this to be a cut-down version of a 1981 Soviet TV Miniseries, which explains the dubbing, grainy 16mm picture, choppy cutting and lack of any recognizable names.  ""Fred Stack"" is actually Fyodor (Fedya) Stukov.  Some people may think this is a fine production, but you should know what you are ordering.
If ""accuracy"" and faithfulness to the book are what you're after, this one may have some value as a curiosity, but if you want to be entertained or to introduce the kids to classic stories, skip this one and read them the book.",992044800,4,1210,4.921568627450981
1379857,5,B00004Z1FZ,"I purchased this DVD to help my son with his American Lit class. This film follows the book so close that it was a great help for him to better understand the material. The film has wonderful production values and one can see that this is a major motion picture epic. Our entire family enjoyed the film, my son obtained a top grade in his class, and we have a wonderful addition to our DVD library.",988588800,6,398,4.25
1379858,5,B00004Z1FZ,"This wonderful motion picture tells Mark Twain's classis tale of two young boys, Tom Sawyer and his best friend, Huck Finn in the 1840's. Tom and Huck witness the murder of Dr. Robinson in the graveyard at midnight. Scared, they run away to become pirates on the mighty Mississippi, swearing never to reveal their secret.
But when a man is wrongfully accused of the murder, the boys know they must come forward with the truth to clear him.
As a librarian who knows the story, it is a joy that the producers stayed true to Twain's story. This is the best film version I have seen. It should entice audiences to read this great American work.",980553600,11,640,4.525862068965517
1379859,5,B00004Z1FZ,"As a teacher, I love classic stories when they are faithfully brought to the screen. The director here has been true to Twain's story of Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huck, showing us life on the Missippi in the 1840's.
Not just for kids, this film can be enjoyed by the entire family. There is the famous fence painting scene when Tom tricks all the other kids to do his work, the intrige of the murder of Dr. Robinson, the hunt for buried treasure, trapped in the caves and young puppy love.
Majestically filmed on the great river, the director paints a tale of adventure that has thrilled readers for generations. This is the type of film that your family will watch a number of times, and all will hail as what great films are ment to be.",976406400,15,743,4.35251798561151
7927951,1,B00004Z1FZ,The reviews here have nothing to do with the Ken Burns PBS production. They all refer to some movie version of Tom & Huck. I would really like to read the reviews pertaining to the show by Ken Burns.,1521072000,,199,4.128205128205129
7927952,2,B00004Z1FZ,"For those who saw the original version of this great film, do not purchase this adaptation.  Many scenes in this film have been cut, the voiceover is all in English with no original soundtrack.  I wish I knew this before I bought the DVD.",1209772800,,238,4.386363636363637
7927953,3,B00004Z1FZ,"It is vital to understand why this version doesn't work and why the original film itself is not this.

Herein is a butchered version of an otherwise good film.  It was badly dubbed and butchered outright for an American release.  The director Stanislav Govorukhin had nothing to do with this cut.

The original film is in three parts - each about an hour and five minutes.  It's lengthy but this makes sense in context, because tv was the dominant medium in Russia for many years (and may still be so) in terms of movie watching.  This would be shown every summer, but not all episodes would be televised for the purposes of one sitting.  Usually an episode a day.  The pacing of the film makes sense when one considers the way we used to watch movies and particularly the way Soviet viewers would watch tv in the past.  With about four channels available one's attention was fixed to whatever was on.  It's a completely different mentality.

This deserves a proper subtitled version that is faithful to the film's original form.  I watched this on a Russian DVD and it's quite lovely, although not the best of Govorukhin films.  Nonetheless one can tell that a lot of love and care went into the production and when Govorukhin takes his time it means that he truly wants to immerse the viewer into the atmosphere of a world so dear to him.

I give this three stars, which is a compromise of sorts.  Meaning that the original film itself is five stars, but this version is one star at best.",1206489600,,1490,4.52808988764045
7927954,1,B00004Z1FZ,"Terrible, awful, impossible to follow!  The characters would burst out into maniacal laughter for no reason.  The dubbing was the worst I have ever seen (and my husband is a Godzilla fanatic, so I have seen a LOT).  There was no continuity to the story, it jumped all over the place.  My daughter had to see the movie for a school report, I thought I ordered the 70's version with Johnnie Whitaker and Jodie Foster.  Couldn't have been more wrong!!  DON'T BUY IT!",1125878400,10,463,4.518072289156627
7927955,2,B00004Z1FZ,Unsatisfactory production.  Dialog was not performed well and was poorly dubbed.  The story remains excellent but was produced badly.,1093910400,10,133,5.947368421052632
7927956,1,B00004Z1FZ,"I can hardly believe MGM/UA would be a part of this messed up production. The acting was barely passable. The audio is so horrible you cannot understand anything being said by Huckelberry Finn who, of course, is a major character. There are no subtitles available on this DVD so good audio becomes even more important. I would not recommend this version of Tom Sawyer to anyone under any circumstances. What a shame that this wonderful work of Mark Twain is not available in a decent format.",1073692800,12,491,4.72093023255814
7927957,5,B00004Z1FZ,"This is a wonderful film for the entire family. A well told tale of Mark Twain's beloved book. It has all the big sets that only MGM could do, and the costumes set the perfect tune for this family epic.
Two young boys gorwing up along the Missippissi River in the days of riverboats and minstrels. Young viewers will be entranced as they watch Tom and Huck Finn ponder what to do next after they wittness the murder of the town's doctor at the graveyard.
This is a film that will be watched again and again. FIVE STARS !",1008892800,5,520,4.262626262626263
7927958,1,B00004Z1FZ,"I can't say for sure, the DVD was messed up.  I hope I can find one that is not.  Are all of them messed up or can I buy another one and not have to worry about it being messed up.  I never had a DVD do what this one did.",1007078400,5,221,3.2941176470588234
7927959,2,B00004Z1FZ,I do not recommend this movie. Of all the non-animated Tom Sawyer movies that I've seen this one's the worst. (The 1938 movie was the best.) The acting (both visual & audio) should have been better. I was disapointed with some of what was left out of the story -even though this is quite a legnthy movie. Some of the background music sounds Europian. And now the clincher: I suspect that this movie was dubbed into English from Russian from the 1981 Soviet Union TV movie: Priklyucheniya Toma Sojera i Geklberri Finna. The names of the director & lead actor were also translated. Stanislav Govorukhin became Stan Govorkin. FYODOR STUKOV became FRED STACK. Is this really so. If it is then I feel that it is dishonest not to disclose this movie's origin.,994982400,5,753,4.669172932330827
7927960,5,B00004Z1FZ,"This is truthfully a period motion picture that your entire family can enjoy. It is devoid of senseless and vulgar language so common in many of today's films. I was gratified to see that MGM did not deviate from Mark Twain's original story. The film begins with the famous fence painting scene where Tom tricks all his friends into doing his work and then follows the adventures of Tom and his friend Huck as they go about being boys in Hannibal along the mighty Mississippi.
There are values that young viewers can learn. Tom and Huck witness the murder of Dr. Robinson. The know the the man accused and jailed of the murder is innocent. The two boys though scared, bravely testify and reveal the true killer's identify.
Fred Stack plays Tom to perfection as the young adventurer, and Lipton is well cast as the endearing but delinquent Huck. All in all a great story, well filmed that our family thoroughly enjoyed.",993340800,16,918,4.672839506172839
