5571852,5,B00BBZDVQS,I absolutely recommend it to everyone!!!! This locations of the movie and the tools offered are a wonderful compliment to each other.,1377734400,3,133,5.090909090909091
5571853,5,B00BBZDVQS,"Lots of Eckhart Tolle quotes throughout the movie.  Bruce Lipton shares some great info, as well as Barbara Marx Hubbard and Eric Pearle and many others.  If you're interested in the Law of Attraction or need instruction meditating (nice meditation exercises in the bonus material) and tapping into your source of inner strength and power, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  Lots of beautiful imagery and scenery sprinkled throughout the movie.  In between the interviews the film maker inserts the story of her own personal journey from frustration, doubt, worry and lack (which many people can relate to) to peace, wholeness, love and happiness.",1370649600,10,652,5.240384615384615
5571854,5,B00BBZDVQS,"I have been reading about the essential topics of life! Starting from the bible all the way to bhagavat gita. Seeking the wisdom from our contemporary sages like Eckhad Tolle or Jack Kornfield. Brilliant minds - no question! But after having seen the film AWAKE by Catharina Roland, I was absolutly stunned! She brought it to THE POINT - just by a very simple and comprehensive approach: starting from a simple question her son asked her at the beginning of the movie! And at the end of this film, or lets better call it a journey, the most complex questions seem to be answered in a way, that is absolutly understandable! Catharina seems to be a practical person: she provides the viewer with tools that enable her/him to put this valuable knwoledge into practice - to use it right away in every day life!
I run 2 yoga studios and give teacher trainings to people who seek deep knowledge. I think I have found a very valuable source of this knowledge right here with this DVD!
A MUST for me and my students!
Thank you!",1365811200,92,1019,4.513513513513513
5571855,5,B00BBZDVQS,"When all is said and done, it comes down to the loving or the lack of loving relationship we each have with ourselves.  ""Awake in the Dream"" empowers that loving relationship with depth, balance, beauty and heart.  The experience of 'stillness' with Arjuna Ardagh is profound.",1361491200,40,276,4.978260869565218
5571856,5,B00BBZDVQS,"Dies ist eine multidimensionale Reise mit einem erstaunlichen Ziel. Du landest bei dir - und hier in deinem Herzen. Du erwachst und siehst: All das bist du. Ein grandioser Film von Catharina. I love it.

This is a multi dimension journey with an amazing goal. You will meet yourself in the center of your heart and you will awake and realize: It's all about you. A marvelous movie from Catharina. I love it.

5571857,5,B00BBZDVQS,"We travelled all over the world and met a lot of healers, shamans and holy places. What Catharina Roland brought together in her movie is amazing. Take it as a gift from the highest source to bring You more and more to YOUR REAL SELF. Awake.
God bless You all. Shanti Omkara",1361491200,38,274,4.288461538461538
5571858,5,B00BBZDVQS,"The variety and offers on the spiritual movie market become bigger and bigger. What Catharina Roland succeeded to offer with her movie AWAKE goes beyond the scope of movies up to date.
In 100 minutes she does not only bring to the point the essence of the most evocative themes of humanity within the interviews of the most well-known spiritual teachers, scientsits and visionaries, but she offers also her personal life story, embedded in beautiful, magical images. The movie also offers very helpful and easy to apply tools, which are supporting the awakening of consciousness in a fascinating easy way.
This movie lives up to it's name AWAKE - for me it is one of the most remarkable, all-embracing and heart opening spiritual masterpiece of present age.
May this wonderful movie also enrich your life and have a lasting effect.

5571860,1,B00BBZDVQS,"This film was a huge disappointment on many levels.  It is more like a marketing video than a personal development video trying to convince the viewer of multiple speakers points of view which contain many inconsistencies.  Some of the speakers quote well known sources of spiritual teachings but give no credible evidence of how that relates to their points of view other than ""love is the answer"".  I felt that some of the featured speakers talked down to the viewer, treating the viewer as inexperienced and ignorant of spiritual maters.  It would have been much better if featured speakers had been more transparent about their own life experiences and let the viewer draw their own conclusions.

This film is not even in the same league as such films like ""I Am"", a quality film that offers much more insight into following a spiritual path.",1497916800,3,846,4.847222222222222

5571862,3,B00BBZDVQS,"The ending meditation is awesome. I agree with some of the theories presented. Unfortunately, three distractingly egotistical effeminate german men monopolized a large portion of the discourse. It seems those who wanted to get their names heard and advertise themselves did the most talking.-this also included a self-proclaimed  hyper shaman.:D Lichtenstein and Pearl are shamefacedly advertising and unenlightened, both horridly and distractingly effeminate as well. Lichtenstein did tell a very poignant story though and I got a lot out of it fighting through the annoying effeminate and self-agrandizing surface. I got nothing ftom the weird german who states ""so am i"" he was just so narcissistic and effeminate and says something so misogynistic i could not obviously get anything he does not have. They obviously paid a lot for their air time-who would listen to them or pay to have them help towards enlightened thinking?

I think if the film were remade with the truly altruistic teachers, it would be a great film. Those who do the most talking in this film are the furthest away from enlightenment. Isn't that always the way it goes?
It was pretty clear who was bankrolling the production given the amount of airtime.  They should have been a little more selfless and let the truly enlightened spread the message.",1492214400,6,1324,5.148837209302326

5571883,1,B00BBZDVQS,"OK for beginners. Very basic. I dozed off in the middle... Very disappointed overall. Title is very deceiving. Nothing about waking up in the dream. Very little new info here. First 5 minutes, I thought I was watching a Goldman Sachs commercial for carbon credit trading - because ""we're"" destroying the planet and all that... then there was some decent info about how ""YOU"" interact with ""the universe"" - the world view is wrong but lines up nicely with new agers... then we get into the power of thoughts, and the fact that you are a ""co-creator"" of your reality - now this is GREAT INFO, but it's also very basic in my opinion, and the last 15 minutes is a remake of ""the secret""... be a co-creator, thoughts are powerful, manifestation, etc. So not without value, just no value to me at all, and very misleading.

I bought it as a gift for my mother, but it would not work in her player. It made a noise like a jet plane and would not play. Took it home and tried it in my player, which is identical to hers and it made the same noise, but I finally got it to play after messing with it for 20 minutes. It was a Mother's day present and by the time she tried it, it was too late to return it.  If you are at all familiar with Neale Donald Walsch and his CWG books then the message and information provided are beneficial if somewhat repetitious.

5571911,5,B00BBZDVQS,"An outstanding presentation! This documentary is pointing many of us in the right direction: to awakening. The freedom from self- identification: believing that the body and mind are our real identity, is the root of human suffering.

The message I walked away with is that once we see ourselves as divine beings playing on this planet, (instead of identifying ourselves as bodies that will one day die),  our connection and perception to the world will change radically. We will truly be free to express our life force without the heaviness of ego's fears, doubts, and attachments.

My collection includes, I AM, Finding Joe, Thrive, Home and Back, Peaceful Warrior, Conversations with God, The Shift and 100's of others but this one is unique. I would like to thank its creator, Katharina Roland ,for being so honest, humble and courageous to share herself so openly and intimately with the world through this film. There are some very fine films in the world, but for me, this one is at the top of the list. If I had to pick only one film to watch for the rest of my life, the choice would be easy because of this film. I personally own three copies, two to share with others.

take on non-duality, spirituality and psychology.  It's the type of movie you need to see a few times due

movie talks about taking 100% responsibility for you life though and not blaming it on some god or external
circumstance or someone else.",1399852800,12,569,4.65

5571947,5,B00BBZDVQS,"I loved this movie. The scenery was stunning and the messages were reaffirming and positive.  I watched it at the perfect time in my life: after the loss of a loved one and feeling such crushing sadness, this movie left me feeling reassured and uplifted. It's something that I think would touch anyone searching for insight or just needing a lift from loss or wavering confidence in your beliefs.",1398297600,28,396,4.739130434782608

5571949,5,B00BBZDVQS,"I watched Awake in the Dream with 2 friends. We all received messages to assist our spiritual growth. The way to move out of judgment resonated with us and the segment on forgiveness was very helpful. When I ordered the video, I thought it would be about life after death or possibly reincarnation. We were pleasantly surprised. I loved the way the messages were delivered and the scenes along with the story line, instead of a group of visionaries/teachers sending bullet points. This is a video to be watched over and over again.",1395360000,31,531,4.720430107526882
5571950,5,B00BBZDVQS,"Simple message here, but sometimes we overcomplicate things, and it takes awhile to soak in. Loved it- highly recommend for anyone who wants peace, love and harmony (not to mention HEALTH) in their life.",1390694400,5,203,5.0
5571951,5,B00BBZDVQS,"Visually stunning, this documentary will completely shift how you view your place in the world, your interactions with others and how you react to circumstances, that appear to be, beyond your control.

It is an intuitively insightful gift, should you choose to apply its principals to your life. I am so grateful that this lovely young woman took the time to go on this quest and share it with the world.

Appropriate, no matter your age, but I think it would be an especially useful ""emotional tool box"" for high school seniors, as they embark on what will become their journey with the world.",1389052800,8,595,4.711538461538462
5571952,4,B00BBZDVQS,The film helps those who are seeking for meaning in life.  We are only AWAKE when we are AWARE of the present moment.  Thinking of the past often brings regret and thinking of the future often brings anxiety.  Many authors convey the same message but this producer does it with passion.  Well done.,1386806400,38,298,4.566037735849057

5571958,1,B00BBZDVQS,Awake takes us through a journey of a woman that goes from distress to some sort of joy.  The film tries to convince us that seeking and wanting nothing is the way to go and the way to joy and peace.  They must have forgot that mankind gets board very easily.  Just sitting or a rock meditating is not part of reality and gets us no where.  We are creators and builders that is what makes us happy and peaceful.  I thought the movie was full of old out-dated beliefs that if someone with half a brain should be able to figure out.,1378771200,20,530,4.106796116504855

8565533,5,B00BBZDVQS,"This woman is a miracle in my life. I am so grateful. She told my story. My Mother abandoned me and told me it was all my fault. I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders and have always felt responsible for everyone else's happiness. In the process I neglected my spirit and my body has and still is suffering. And now I understand why I have had so many health struggles. So, I am now 50 years old and on a journey to self-healing. There is still a tremendous amount of pain in my personal life but this will help me get through it. This helped me a tremendous amount. I have already practiced Buddhism off and on for several years and although that fulfills a part of what I need, it hasn't fulfilled all. I've also tried to practice the Law of Attraction for several years. NOW I understand how it works because of this documentary. I plan to watch it again this week. I love this woman and the people in her documentary. What beautiful people they all are. I am so very grateful for her and very happy for her healing.",1499212800,3,1031,4.238578680203045
