8217656,3,B000VA3JDE,Not as great as the previous seasons. Catherine introduces some new characters and doesn't perform others. There are some cast changes which made this season a little disappointing.,1493942400,,181,5.5

8217660,5,B000VA3JDE,"Don't pay attention to the dumb review that gave it one star because of the region availability. It's really not that difficult to convert your dvd player or laptop to play region 2 dvds. The series itself is wonderful and hilarious as can be expected from Catherine Tate and there are old favorites like Nan and Lauren as well as some brand new characters. Too bad this was the last season that they did, but I commend them for going out on top and finishing strong. And at least we have the dvds and Christmas specials.",1356480000,,521,4.4375
