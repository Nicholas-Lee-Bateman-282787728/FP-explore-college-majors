4514901,5,B0050KD700,My daughter saw a portion of Furious Love at a youth service and pulled some of it up on YouTube.  We couldn't wait to get both DVDs and we were not disappointed.  We have become so complacent as believers and only pick and choose WHAT we believe from the Bible.  This in my opinion was beautifully done.,1321228800,3,304,4.298245614035087
8451319,5,B0050KD700,"Darren Wilson paints a picture that few Christian documentaries have ever come close to delivering.  The Lord never just stopped performing miracles, they are just not reported or dismissed as religious fringe fables.

8451323,5,B0050KD700,Truly inspiring and motivating.  I highly recommend these movies to see.  It will change your perspective and expand your thoughts.  If you haven't watched the 3rd one - Father of Lights - get that as well. You won't be disappointed!,1344816000,,233,4.775

8451325,5,B0050KD700,"I am changed. I am praying to be more open minded of the things of God, and hoping more and more to walk in His love. Love and forgiveness is what motivates Jesus, and it needs to be my motivation as well. I'm grateful for this film, and believe it or not, actually was healed watching ""Finger of God"". A man was praying in the film for various things for a certain woman, and I got so tickled at her reaction to how God showed him all these things about her. The moment he told her ""sinuses"" I yelled ""Oh my goodness, I can breathe better!"" I couldn't believe it. Our family has already loaned out our dual set, and I just told my Mom about both films. Something is seriously wrong with American Christianity, we've allowed self righteousness and politics to swallow it up, but where is sweet Holy Spirit? Can't wait for ""Father of Lights""!",1329264000,,841,4.3630573248407645
8451326,5,B0050KD700,"An interview with a man raised from the dead?  Amazing!  I was gripped in my spirit even just hearing what was contained in this DVD, and I was not disappointed.  My greatest fear was that it would come across too unbelievable (and pushy) like a magic show... and unacceptable to the skeptics among us.  Not so.  It is done with humility and grace. It's full of love.  It is impossible to turn it off once you start watching. This is a wonderful story of the miraculous being revealed in a way that draws you in.",1329177600,,512,4.336842105263158
8451327,5,B0050KD700,"It is a great video which shows what GOD is doing with ""ordinary people"" just like you and me, the only ""request"" is To Believe and GOD will do it.",1323734400,4,147,3.933333333333333
