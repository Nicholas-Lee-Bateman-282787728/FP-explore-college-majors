8663062,5,B00L1D5LL8,This DVD really helps explain the politics in the military.  Politicians pulling the strings of the military higher command and then letting the lower echelon (lower ranking officers and enlisted men to take the entire blame),1427587200,,225,5.25
8663063,3,B00L1D5LL8,"Interesting and worth watching/hearing, but I did expect much more. Most the information provided I was already aware of.

8663064,5,B00L1D5LL8,A very good and well though out documentary by Terry.,1407715200,,53,4.4
8663065,5,B00L1D5LL8,"Exciting story about Special forces action on the border during the Vietnam War.  Interesting connection to a matter of some public interest stateside.  Good to see names and faces of people endangered and harmed by the treason of the interpreter in question, since according to what I have read the widow of Chuyen made a big fuss in the media at the time.  Sometimes we civilians forget that spies cost lives.

Will Williams made for a good interviewee and I especially enjoyed his contribution.

Thanks for this documentary.",1405382400,,527,4.943181818181818
8663066,4,B00L1D5LL8,"Terry was one of my  Communications Sergeants at Thanh Tri, a Special Forces camp located along the Cambodian boarder during the Vietnam War.  He contacted me and several members of A-414 where the incident originated for our take on the story which became known as ""The Green Beret Affair"".  Terry and his wife Susan were guests in my house about a year ago where I was interviewed on camera. He did the same with other team members and sprinkled in news footage, photos and commentary.

 He has done a good job exploring behind the scene details when a double agent was terminated and General Creighton Abrams, who had a well known disdain for Special Forces, threw 5th SFGA Commander Colonel Rheault and several members of his staff in jail. This incident dominated national news for several weeks and fueled antiwar efforts. It also signaled the beginning of the end of Special Forces involvement in Vietnam.  Most camps were quickly converted to regular armed forces use. The concept of Special Forces as a US Army organization was even brought into question. If GEN Abrams had not become sick and died soon after Vietnam, Special Forces might have been relegated to the ash heap of history.

Additional details about the incident can be found at  https://sites.google.com/site/specialforcesa414/  and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_GAMMA",1405382400,7,1350,5.208333333333333
8663067,5,B00L1D5LL8,"As a former Green Beret Captain of A-camp 414, I am grateful for Terry's film about the history of Than Tri.  In an even voice, Mr. McIntosh delivers the special forces viewpoint of what went down in 1969.  Up until now, the only part of the story the public has heard was what the CIA and higher paid grades wanted the public to hear.  He tells our story and how men whose lives depend on their decisions must make difficult moral choices in an ambigious war.  Thanks for telling it the way it was, Terry.",1404691200,7,506,4.294736842105263
8663068,5,B00L1D5LL8,"I have watched this documentary two times.  I find it quite interesting and the narration is easy to follow and quite believable.  It is unfortunate, but after serving 20 years in the armed forces, many of the actions take are really quite predictable.
I strongly recommend that it be seen by those who were there, and by those who were not.",1403654400,8,341,4.573770491803279
8663069,5,B00L1D5LL8,"This documentary addresses several heretofore unanswered questions about the famous ""Green Beret Affair."" It should be picked up by a TV network and given wider exposure. Purchase, view, and join discussion. This is a great format for vets to tell of their experiences first hand.",1403222400,6,280,5.2444444444444445
