8490239,2,B0060ANNP8,"I chose this movie on recommendation of my little niece.  Maybe she got something out of it, but I was still waiting for the plot, the point of the story when it finished.  I ended up saying,""What was that all about?""",1368662400,,217,4.2682926829268295
8490240,2,B0060ANNP8,"The film is a low budget production, but about what you would expect... I wasn't particularly impressed with the script or the production values, but overall, acceptable. The problem is the DVD transfer. It may be the worst I have ever seen. Reel changes remain visible, the color is washed out, and the audio becomes garbled to the point where one can barely follow the plot in the last scenes of the film. Amazon should drop this product until the distributors remaster the DVD.",1341360000,6,480,4.726190476190476
8490241,2,B0060ANNP8,"This film is poorly directed and acted. It's maudlin. The DVD transfer is the worst I have ever seen.

The scenes of Jerusalem are interesting and quite beautiful, however.",1335830400,,172,4.931034482758621
