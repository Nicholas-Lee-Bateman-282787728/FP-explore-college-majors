8499833,5,B006JVT58W,"When we last left ""Sorakake,"" the Kirkwood colony was under Nerval's icy control, forcing the refugees to flee to Leopard; Nami's recklessness had gotten her into serious trouble; Honoka-chan was on a desperate mission to retrieve Professor FON; and Akiha was trapped inside one of Nerval's boxes.  Now, in the final volume, there is sacrifice, betrayal, redemption, and (semi-spoiler alert!) a happy ending.  Of course, there will always be those who won't learn from their experiences, and by now you can probably guess the character that doesn't!
  It's interesting to me how -fast- everything happens in Volume 4; by the end of the series, I was having to back up the DVD to catch all the dialogue, and some of the action sequences needed my Zoom button to make out what was happening; but it may just be that I'm getting old and slow.  I am sure the younger audiences for whom this anime was intended will catch everything right away.  Which brings me to my one complaint about this series: the English subtitles are -yellow,- and they often clash with the surounding scenery. Green subtitles are used for PA announcements and any off-screen voices, while white is for the Japanese lyrics in the opening and closing songs, and both are much more visible; I wonder why Bandai did not choose one of the other colors for the English dialogue?
  But that aside, I still enjoyed this final volume, and even more so as there is an extended version of the final episode as well as the standard version; and if you watch the ending animation during the closing song, there is a chibi-style whimsical wrap-up of some of the loose ends (like, what happened to everyone on the Moon after Nerval deep-froze it?).
  And that's it...a most fitting end to ""Sorakake Shouju."" As Honoka-chan would say, ""Mission complete.""",1346803200,3,1810,4.828478964401294
