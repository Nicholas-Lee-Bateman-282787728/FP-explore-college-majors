8422916,4,B004CD1TRY,"This is a region 3 DVD and will not play on the standard U.S. players. It will play on my laptop.
The movie itself is fun. The situation is a little unreal, but this movie makes it seem believable that two teenagers can run away and survive on their own for a year (the amount of time the movie covers.) The teens are not lovers, nor even boyfriend and girlfriend when they run away, they are just friends. Each is running away for their own reasons and simply run away together. They find a place to live, and the boy gets odd jobs to support them. Slowly them become lovers, and eventually get married (well at least in their own minds).
The tone of the movie is light, and even funny in places. As far as nudity in this movie, the boy is clearly seen nude from the rear a couple of times and the girl's breasts are seen several times. She is also seen completely nude in low light once, which is full rear nudity and turns to where she is almost seen from the front before covering herself. There are also a couple of sex scenes, which are tactfully done showing them only from about the chest up or neck up.
There was only one scene which I felt was too unbelievable, and before explaining it let me just say that it might be considered a little bit of a spoiler. Near the end of the movie when the child is born, I felt that Paul was much to calm during the birth.",1388707200,3,1369,4.169811320754717
8422917,1,B004CD1TRY,It is not compatible with any of our dvd players.  We are returning this dvd to the owners this week.,1384732800,,101,4.05
8422918,5,B004CD1TRY,"So glad to find this film on DVD. It is a movie about first love, and the consequences that come from being young, and idealistic.
The seller was very prompt, and I had no issues. I would buy from them again.",1381104000,2,208,4.097560975609756
8422919,5,B004CD1TRY,"This is one of two movies, the other called Friends, and both are just awesome.  My mom saw this when she was young and so she rented it, you know ... back when you could still rent movies, and I got to see it as a teen.  The other movie is called Paul and Michelle.  I love both of them, bittersweet endings, but all in all awesome.  The bad part is that you can buy this one, but not the other on DVD.  And this one is not region 1.  But if you have a region free player, then get it.  You will love it if you like movies from that time.",1371600000,4,539,3.7589285714285716
