8441527,5,B004UFKVAU,"The last of the Irwin Allen gems of the 60s, Land of the Giants ran for 2 seasons, and tells the  story of the marooned crew and passengers of the first suborbital craft Spindrift. Noteable for the special effects (I. e. The giants) this series was well received but faded out as the decade closed. Now I should tell you that these discs are region 2 PAL. You will need a region free player, or a multi-region player. (they are not that expensive any more) and you can find them on Amazon.com. Any of these will allow you to enjoy this last gem of a series.",1471824000,4,557,4.254716981132075
8441528,4,B004UFKVAU,"Never liked the whining character that was portrayed in this Syfy flik but purchased anyway; however, the other characters were great and believable.

You have to have a player that will play this series.  U.S. and Canada players will not play it.",1331769600,,247,4.857142857142857
