8546038,4,B00A1AU68U,"Merchant-Ivory films would later explore the clash of Western & Eastern cultures in more weighty terms; but in the early to mid-1960s, their films had a looser, more comic style, a product of the times that really captured the tone of those times. Inspired by the stories of real-life musicians (such as George Harrison) who went to India in search of both musical & spiritual teaching, here we follow pop star Tom Pickle (Michael York) as he goes to study the sitar with master musician Ustal Zafar Khan (Uptal Dutt). The dedicated guru soon discovers that having Pickle as his guest & student has landed him in a pickle as well, with star-smitten hippie girls showing up to disrupt what should have been a serious apprenticeship. Or is Pickle really all that serious in the long run? One hippie girl in particular, Jenny (the always delightful & irresistible Rita Tushingham), may well be more than a mere distraction. Meanwhile, the guru's own family & household also suffer the effects of Pickle's visit.

This alone is a fascinating premise for a film. But there's so much more going on as well. Khan isn't a pasteboard sage, dispensing dubiously thin slivers of ""wisdom"" to the materialistic Westerners. He's a three-dimensional human being: divinely gifted as a musician, but as flawed & sometimes vain, jealous, and driven by ego as any other man. Jenny sees only a holy man whose mere presence makes the world a better place; what she can't see for a long time is that she's projecting her own innate goodness onto Khan, because she's utterly unaware of what a basically good & decent person she is herself. And the bond of respect & affection between Khan & Pickle often turns into a real struggle of wills, complicated by Khan's own personal entanglements.

Clearly this is a film set quite specifically in a fleeting time, one that's long since been homogenized & packaged for popular consumption by later generations. But it does capture something of the atmosphere then, when many people really were searching for enlightenment in places like India. All too often their interest turned out to be superficial, incapable of staying the course & doing the hard spiritual work. Even so, there was a magic to it all, however brief & ephemeral, that deserves better than the one-dimensional media caricature that it's been reduced to now. Impossible to find for decades, the red-headed stepchild of the Merchant-Ivory stable, it's finally available as a made-on-demand DVD. A lesser film to be sure, but an enjoyable one, with some lingering food for thought -- recommended!",1358640000,5,2582,4.933333333333334
