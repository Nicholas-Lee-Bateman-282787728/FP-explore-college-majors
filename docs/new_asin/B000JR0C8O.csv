8152682,4,B000JR0C8O,"Stone The Crows in their final days, live in a German TV studio. Jimmy McCulloch has replaced the late Les Harvey on guitar, and does a fine job of filling big shoes. Maggie Bell is in great voice. The band choogles away solidly. This performance is more-or-less the ""Ontinuous Performance"" album live  - an excellent, bluesy record which was my introduction to Maggie Bell after first hearing her backing Rod Stewart on ""Every Picture Tells A Story"". A highly underrated band and a singer who never got the level of success she deserved.
Sound quality is very listenable considering the source, and the picture quality is pretty reasonable too.
Extras are sparse, but include a good latter-day interview with Maggie which (briefly) covers her career to date.
The cover picture is from a completely different performance.",1265846400,3,821,5.036764705882353
