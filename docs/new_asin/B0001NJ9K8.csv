8015314,3,B0001NJ9K8,"I bought this DVD on amazon (Feb 2017 @ $44.00, it's now around$27.00). My comments do take in consideration the price I bought this DVD at because my expectations were accordingly quite high. I bought DVD 4 (and for the value) I was very happy about. It looks like this is a transfer of a video to a DVD and the resulting quality is far from being HD (DVD4 transfer looked better from my point of view). I think this DVD is a mix of too many things that are shown without a proper (in depth) explanations / descriptions. I find the title ""grappling technics"" a bit misleading compared to the content. Now, I need to mentioned that if I had bought this DVD/CD around $27.00 my deception might not have been that high... There is still good content and good examples for people of no or little knowledge of Judo throws or chokes. This DVD is not bad but compared to the others it's just OK.",1488758400,,889,4.3293413173652695

Grappling Techniques

By Wally Jay

 This volume starts with Wally Jay reviewing his small circle techniques as applied to Jujitsu.  The small circle technique is followed by a demonstration on how to fall.

 Demonstrations of seven throws and a variable number of variations of each throw as they might be applied to actual scenarios of self defense are demonstrated three times each followed by demonstrations of other grappling techniques and procedures including knee locks, hook sweep, Leg block, double and single leg take downs, various arm bars, arm locks, and leg holds and locks.

 Wally Jay demonstrates a few choke revival techniques before concluding this volume with demonstrations of several choke holds.

 Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujitsu is available on VHS or DVD.  He has also authored a book by the same title name, which can be used to reinforce the video lesson.  The book and the DVD or VHS lessons complement each other well and contain a great deal of information for beginning thru intermediate level students.

 I have all the volumes of videos and his Small Circle Jujitsu book.  I never get tired or bored of watching them.  Rather, the more I examine the work in them, the more I appreciate having them.  I think that you might enjoy them as much as I if you enjoy demonstrations of intelligent fighting systems.
