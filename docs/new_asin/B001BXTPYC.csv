8285213,5,B001BXTPYC,This show was one of the cooler shows I've ever watched. Competition plus cultural immersion equals riveting T.V. I wish this show would have gone on for more seasons than 2 because I could seen years more of quality T.V. like this. A really amazing show!,1422403200,,255,4.565217391304348
8285214,5,B001BXTPYC,"This series is amazing. Fun to watch, and you learn about cultures all around the world. Viewing these sacred rituals in these tribes is an honor. And it doesnt hurt to have all sorts of men competing!",1287878400,,201,4.45945945945946
8285215,5,B001BXTPYC,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  We watched this when it originally aired on TV with our grown son.  This show is a really fun
show to watch.  The contestants have great personalities and rapport
with each other as well as a healthy competitive spirit.  It was fascinating learning about the customs and people who they visited.  I look forward to our son coming to visit so we can watch it again with him.  We also were able to catch a couple episodes which we had missed.  We are hoping that they have a second Last One Standing on TV.",1232409600,,549,4.323529411764706
8285216,5,B001BXTPYC,"I watched the show when it was originally brodcast. Lets say I was waiting by the television at the time it aired every week. This is one the best shows that came on television it is too bad it probably will not have a second season. It took over a year to film. So add this to your collection, because you probably will not see it again.",1229558400,4,338,4.059701492537314
8285217,5,B001BXTPYC,"I have been waiting for this show to become available.  I came across it by accident, and wow, this is probably the most memorable show ever.  To watch these six young men embrace different cultures and test their mental and physical limits was something to watch.  The best part is seeing how each of them changed during the experience.  Rajko was my eye candy on this show, but I did get an opportunity to meet the Jason during a BMX race here in my hometown.  He seemed so untamed and almost arrogant in the first few shows, but the experience gave him a maturity and a better sense of self.  It was a joy to go through these experiences with these men, and I will always remember this unique show.",1225411200,3,701,4.3538461538461535
8285218,5,B001BXTPYC,"I have to admit, what first drew me into the show was the super-hyped advertisement of a few extremely fit,(and one particular, not to beat around the bush, tall, dark haired, gorgeous British guy), sporting tribal wear, fighting passionately, raw, in all sorts of exotic landscapes and cultures, all set to the infectious, adrenaline infused beat of Saliva's ""Ladies and Gentlemen.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Stained-Love-Story/dp/B000KJTFD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Stained Love Story</a>

When I started watching, it was all that, but so, so much more. That show had me so inspired and pumped, I was in the best shape of my life from the first episode to well after the last. As for the six very unique young men, they were real, extremely likable characters that drew you in each on their own, you root for them all. Okay, I lied there, I never thought Corey belonged in the show, in fact I insulted him a lot through my t.v., and I adored Rajko above them all. But five amazing characters out of six, you can't get better than that, and I've watched a lot of reality shows! Don't get me started on the cultures, the connections they made, the injuries, or the mental, physical, and spiritual highs and lows they all faced.

I have searched for other shows like this one, and none has ever come close to Last One Standing.

From day one, I spouted this show to every single person I knew like I was getting paid for marketing, and I definitely recommend it to you.",1214870400,7,1531,5.019685039370079
