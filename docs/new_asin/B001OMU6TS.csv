8330842,5,B001OMU6TS,"If you are someone who loves Yosemite you need to buy this dvd...Tom personally narrates and introduces  the songs,,,each song is layered with the historic photos and moving pictures of times in Yosemite valley from early 1900s to the 1970s.....there is something for young and those older folks that remember how it used to be in Yosemite where you could pull into camp 7,14,2,4,,,and pick your own campsite without having to reserve everything,,,,no restrictions on how close to the Merced you could camp,and a fire in the campfire was going from morning till time to crawl in the tent for the night......but best of all,,there are vintage movies of building the campfire on top of Glacier Point,,,the call from Camp Curry on the valley floor to Glacier,,,and the most beautiful sight you will see of the Firefall and the stream of orange and red coals falling 1500 feet over the cliff...anyone who was in Yosemite before January of 1968 will never forget how magical that was every nite at 9 pm........as you can see,,,I love this dvd,,,,there is nothing out there about Yosemite as good as this one..the last thing to say is Thank You Tom Bopp for editing and putting this dvd together for all of us that have a little age on us and have loved Yosemite National Park since we were little kids. ...Bryan C",1378252800,,1308,4.7368421052631575
