8167368,5,B000BVNS7K,"WOW, what a treat. I had never seen some of the early shows, including the opener. Now it all makes SENSE!!!

Its nice having this series on DVD, but there was no remastering done in the transfer. Thats a shame cause some of the blips on the screen are a little distracting, they could have at least cleaned up the Dallas intro for crying out loud.

But this show has stood the test of time and the characters are just as interesting today as they were 30 years ago. Very entertaining, nice boxed package with some extras like commentary by Larry Hagman that is worth checking out. Maybe some day this will get a proper DVD redo.",1165622400,3,629,4.367521367521367
