7907058,5,B00000F473,"(Same review for the Russian version. Due to ADHD I was on wrong video. Right movie. Just wrong version, especially since my dasbidanya is nyet too good! Oh well.) I recently watched this video off of YouTube with English dubbing, which was actually done quite well.  I can only tell you that it was a most interesting story of, as best as I could follow it, an android (humanoid) woman found in an abandoned spaceship or something (I apologize for my ADHD...I get to watch my favorite movies 20 times & still catch something I missed...always keeps me on my toes). She has no memory.  As time goes on she has little bits & pieces fall into place, realizing she was made for a purpose but  not sure what.  The one thing that kept my attention was the eyes of the starlet who played the humanoid. Large irises, large eyes period, compared to her head size. There are many little surprises like her abilities to stop things, transmit herself from one place to another (I think it was mainly in close quarters, like standing in front of someone & suddenly being behind them), etc. I wasn't sure if her ability to jump long distances was due to her being a humanoid or if the planet of the people she was found by (earth? I am not sure b/c they seem to have powers as well-again, I apologize for details, but I only saw it once, by a random act of chance) has a lighter gravity. She was created by someone who was trying to save their planet. She begins to hear things, which she feels is the others calling to her (I think a total of 14 were made, but it could be 43 or 74 for all I know). Flashbacks of her creator w/his explaining to her & the others their reason for being. There is someone who of course is evil & tries to destroy her & her saviors as they come to help rescue her dying planet, as they want to control their world by fear.  All in all it was a very interesting little feature. I hope to see it come out on DVD, if possible, with the English dubbing I saw online. I realize it is not Academy quality per se (albeit there are many so-called Academy pictures that I feel have no business being there & seem to be there more out of the PC movement that enslaves Hollywood rather than actual credibility...but alas, what do I know? I'm just a silly old man w/ADHD who still believes in God, moral absolutes (for you kids that haven't been taught what that is, it's what's called right & wrong...something evolutionists can never explain b/c...well, maybe you can still find out what that is at the library...).  Sorry. I digress on occasion. I haven't taken my morning meds yet. Anyways, bottom line is, this is a wonderful little film from what I was able to view once so far. I may change my mind later. However, I don't think so. There are a lot of little things going on including, yes, a love story. But alas, I've told you too much. Try & watch this if you can get a chance.",1327708800,4,2893,4.299082568807339
