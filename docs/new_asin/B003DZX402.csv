4112483,4,B003DZX402,A nice review of the later part of the season and in depth review of the Playoffs.  Well photographed.,1284768000,,102,4.368421052631579
4112484,3,B003DZX402,Read the bottom of the back side of the case.  350 minutes for 5 games over 5 discs.  That's roughly 70 minutes a disc/game...not enough for the full games.,1284076800,,156,4.344827586206897
4112485,5,B003DZX402,"A great finale to a terrific season is captured in this dvd.  It is a
welcome tribute to all long suffering Chicago hockey fans. The excitement
provided by the 2010 Blackhawk team rivaled the Chicago Bear Super Bowl
team of 1985.  This dvd reflected the highs and lows of the past season.
Very highly recommended for all hockey fans in Chicago.",1283040000,,344,4.622950819672131
4112486,5,B003DZX402,"Great Blu Ray - As a life long Blackhawks fan, i could not wait to get my hands of this. Well produced and gave the flavor of the Hawks Season. The video has interviews with most the players and management and nice game highlights especially during the playoffs. The Disc also has special features such as Behind The Scenes With The Stanley Cup
Extended Locker Room Stanley Cup Celebration
Extended Chicago Parade Celebration
i do wish the blu ray had more extras though (maybe more interviews with former players on what this stanley cup meant?) I do know though there is a special edition coming on later this year so i am excited/ must have for any blackhawks fans",1282348800,2,667,4.61344537815126
4112487,5,B003DZX402,"After reading some good and bad reviews about this dvd, I was skeptical. I received it, played it, and am completely happy with my purchase. It recaps the season well, obviously focusing on the playoffs.

Simply put, if you're a Blackhawks fan, you need this to reflect on the year of history.

Also, the blu-ray is AWESOME.",1281484800,,324,4.666666666666667
4112488,2,B003DZX402,"If I could sum up this DVD/Blu-Ray, it is the Washington Capitals in the 2010 Playoffs.  So much is expected, but there is immediate disappointment.  I watched the main feature and 3 of the bonus sections (there are perhaps 10 or so), and had to stop to write this.  My comments are from my experience thus far:

This feels like a disheartened overly commercial feature, through and through.  No drama, no excitement, no nothing.  I got goosebumps watching random Blackhawks TV online over the season.  This main ""feature"" never comes close once.  They went as far as using what must be a History Channel commentator with a sleepy voice instead of Olcyzk or Foley.  Instead, they gave those 2 pros boring interviews instead.

Want to see/hear players?  They feature a few.  And I mean a few.  I guess 80% of the team was unavailable.  For the game action, they used such short sequences that it makes Versus look like Golden Globe winners.  There was no setup, no buildup of impactful events.  Instead, they talk about it briefly, show 3 seconds of what happened, skip the next 2 goals, and repeat.

No mention of the rocking United Center anthems on this disc.  In fact, there is little to hear at all.  The audio, which decodes as DTS, is in fact stereo.  I checked my system 3 times.  Yes, this is the first stereo Blu-Ray I own.

Positives?  The first 2 bonus parts I watched were personal, insightful, interesting, and something I haven't seen before.  Frankly, it made up for the last hour I frowned.  The 3rd bonus came on, and the visual presentation was awesome.  This is why I buy Blu-ray.  But the audio choice?  Horrendous.  If you want powerful music, well, they missed by a mile.

I am hoping the rest of the bonus features makes up for it.  The main feature is not worthy of any cup team.  Yours truly, a Hawk fan of 20+ years.",1280534400,11,1842,4.538226299694189
4112489,5,B003DZX402,"This is the playoff games set NOT the celebration set. Dee dee dee... THIS set will be the playoff games not a mash up of highlights. The celebration dvd and bluray were awsome. Jesus people its been 49 years coming. Be happy with it. It was better than any dvds for teams before this. Hater canuck fans, I swear!!!",1280448000,5,315,4.3559322033898304
4112490,1,B003DZX402,"I just received my Blu-ray copy of this product.  Amazon's description claims two discs, but the packaging is obviously only designed for one disc.  I'm disappointed.",1279670400,3,166,5.346153846153846
4112491,4,B003DZX402,"I bought the Blu-ray version, thinking I was getting a bit more, when in fact the DVD is like 1 30min or so long, with a few extras, Towes, Kane being drafted a little recap of the parade. It was good, but I would of liked a better recap of the season, not 10min, then focusing on the playoffs for the rest. I found it funny, with the extras, Tallon saying when Kaner was drafted, we like him, he is willing to go into the trees and score, meaning he doesn't care about defensemen, I was thinking where is that Kaner?!? It is worth buying, just wished there was more than 2hrs of overall footage.",1279584000,7,596,4.191304347826087
4112492,5,B003DZX402,"A great dvd for any fan of the Black Hawks as it is a great recap of the marvelous Stanley Cup Championship. It has a wondeful recap of the season including many highlights, but the playoff coverage is splendid. In particular, the highlights of the Stanley Cup Finals against Philedelphia is marveous. It is a blast to watch it over and over. A must have.",1279584000,8,355,4.476923076923077

4112517,3,B003DZX402,Very informative dvd but I was hoping to see at least four FULL games. I was very disappointed that there were none. I won't be buying 2013 dvd.,1396656000,,144,4.178571428571429

4112520,4,B003DZX402,"The DVD has a good review of the lead up to the 2010 season, plus good highlights of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs.  The DVD should have included more of the championship celebration in the main program, rather than as an extra.",1376006400,,228,4.428571428571429
4112521,4,B003DZX402,"Game 5 Quarters against Nashville -- Kaner's shortie ties game with seconds remaining, Hossa emerges from the box after serving a 5-minute boarding major to win the game is often overlooked -- losing that game would have created two must-win elimination games.  Everything else is basically the NBC coverage of the four Chicago victories -- the first trip to Philadelphia for Games 3/4 is simply dropped.

4112553,5,B003DZX402,"Did a great job of telling the story in a way that did not drag on, although would have loved if they spent more time on the road to the Stanley Cup and the parade afterwards, which was pretty special. But well done and a great way to re-live a great fan memory.",1364947200,,262,3.9622641509433962

4112560,5,B003DZX402,"I love this DVD for the 2010 Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks.  It includes the regular season, post season run to the cup and of course all the Stanley Cup games.  It included great features like the Stanley Cup parade highlights Towes and Kane being drafted and much much more. I recommend this DVD for Die Hard Blackhawk fans",1346889600,,335,4.661016949152542

4112562,4,B003DZX402,"For any Blackhawks fan this would be an optimal gift. I bought a copy for my dads 61st b-day and it cost me less than six bucks including shipping. Came in the mail in about 3 days in perfect condition. Being so cheap, I thought the case would be junk but the disc is easy to pop out and snaps back just as easily. About the film itself...It covers every playoff game that involved the Hawks leading up to the Stanley cup and then (obviously)all six games against Philly to take the cup. The reason I gave this a four out of five is because although the film does a good job of capturing the hardships and triumphs of the playoffs, it isn't very in depth. Just kinda skims the surface of all that went on during the playoffs, but i would have liked for more background on the organization and interviews with more than just a couple players. All in all though I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it to any Chicago Blackhawks fan.",1336435200,,935,4.318181818181818

4112574,2,B003DZX402,"Don't get me wrong...all the games are there. It was obvious to me, however, they put next to no effort into the production of this set. There is no extra footage included, no pre-game analysis or interviews, the editing seems to favor saving time to the extreme...it cuts out most replays and shows the face off immediately following a play stopping whistle. I understand this may be what some people are looking for so they don't have to skip forward past the stuff they don't want to see, however I would like to at least have the option to see some of the stanley cup hype that brings me back to this awesome season. Don't expect anything but game play with this set and it will be what you expect.",1309651200,2,702,4.407692307692308

4112576,2,B003DZX402,We were disappointed in this purchase. The video content was uninspiring and rather flat considering the exciting year that the Blackhawks had. Would not recommend. Buy the book instead.,1299542400,,186,5.448275862068965
4112577,1,B003DZX402,"It's funny how this DVD seems to have been crafted with a generic audience in mind -- apparently 12 and into MTV -- the NHL made this vid, but as a souvenir of a belated title it's awful. I rented it from Blockbuster, and even then I feel ripped off. Schizophrenic camera angles, context-less montages . . . this is an awful DVD. I feel bad for people who've paid for it, even if it's a gift for someone else. I just hope my memory lasts awhile, because this DVD is horribly insufficient.",1294444800,,488,4.258064516129032
4112578,2,B003DZX402,"The NHL site sells the Warner Home Video Chicago Blackhawks 2010 Stanley Cup Champions Special Edition DVD - Roar to the Cup for just under $50 bucks so of course we all come a hunting elsewhere.  As I looked I found a load of sites with the SAME DVD picture as the Shop NHL site but all said FOUR DISKS!!!!!!!!
The Shop NHL clear states what is on their FIVE Discs:
Number of Discs: 5
Disc 1: April 24, 2010 - Kane's shorthander ties it with 13.6 seconds left and Hossa's goal 4:07 into overtime wins Game 5 of the Western Conference Quarterfinal
Disc 2: May 29, 2010 - Stanley Cup Finals Game 1 - Tomas Kopecky's third-period tally is decisive in a wild, 6-5 'Hawks win
Disc 3: May 31, 2010 - Stanley Cup Finals Game 2 - Antti Niemi's 32 saves and goals 28 seconds apart by Hossa and Ben Eager give Chicago a 2-0 series lead
Disc 4: June 6, 2010 - Stanley Cup Finals Game 5 - 'Hawks reclaim series lead with first-period explosion and clutch goals galore
Disc 5: June 8, 2010 - Stanley Cup Finals Game 6 - Kane scores in OT and the Chicago Blackhawks are Stanley Cup champions
This was an officially licensed product.

I tend to agree with the rest of the critics here, that the video breakdown, done at the PARADE site,and again at the convention, going game by game of the 16 game journey is an exciting way to memorialize this 49 year drought.
As much as I loved the Finals, the road traveled through Nashville, Vancouver and San Jose before ever reaching the dirty tactics of the Flyers in the final games.

I think the think-tank at NHL offices needs to re-think and re-market this last year's March, and I bet they sell a couple million of the DVDs IF they show game by game highlights.  The REAL Wiz",1292198400,4,1708,4.311526479750778
4112579,1,B003DZX402,"I'm a Blackhawks fan, and by the overall appearence of this DVD, I'd say it was put together as quickly as possible and on a shoestring budget! Production values were awful, choice of highlights poor to average, narration just so-so. I'd rate this DVD a waste of money, a waste of time, a waste product!",1288396800,,303,4.527272727272727
4112580,5,B003DZX402,"I don't know what some others are reviewing for this particular product, but this set of dvds is just the 4 Cup wins against Philly, and 1 win against Nashville during the playoffs (pivotal game 5).  That's it. No more, no less.  These are the games as they appeared on TV, with the original network commentators.  There are no extras.

Plain and simple, this set is only a replay of the Blackhawk's wins.  So if you want to re-live and rewatch the games themselves, this is an excellent purchase.  If you want more, you'll have to look at another set. Hope this clears up some of the nonsense others have posted about these particular dvds.

4112581,2,B003DZX402,"I bought the ""5"" disc Special Edition set that has Game 5 of the Nashville series and all four (4) wins in the Finals against the Flyers from NHL.com.  The DVD video quality is very poor, even when playing on a BlueRay player that does a great job of upconverting the image.  The games look like those 1970 football games they show on the NFL Network.  Very poor video quality when they show the long distance shots, like poor VHS quality.  Close up images are not too bad.  I am keeping it because they have all four wins showing the compelete game (with no commercials and no intermissions) and I want it until the package comes out on BlueRay HD format.  Guess having teh wins in poor quality is better than not having them at all but if I would have know they were this poor of quality before I bought it, I would definitely NOT have bought it.
