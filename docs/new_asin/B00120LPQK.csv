3071284,5,B00120LPQK,"Hell in a Cell has been called the most dangerous match in the WWE since its debut in 1997. The cell has definitely shorten and ended not only susperstars's careers but also referees and managers. This 3 disc set shows you the best remembered Hell in the Cell Matches over the past 10 years of it's exsistence. If you have seen the Ladder Match DVD set then you will really love this set as well. This set is just as good as the Ladder Match 3 disc set is.

Mick Foley hosts the presentation and he starts off the program by giving a brief back story on why and how the Hell in a Cell Match came to be. The Hell In A Cell Matches that are not included in this set are Undertaker Vs. Big Bossman from Wrestlemania XV, Kennel in a Cell Match: Al Snow Vs. Big Bossman from Unforgiven 1999, & Undertaker Vs. Edge from SummerSlam 2008.

Bad Blood (October 5, 1997)
Undertaker Vs. European Champion Shawn Michaels - In the HIAC's debut match, Michaels and Undertaker sets the bar for future HIAC matches to come. Undertaker just really dominates HBK for mostly all the match. Once the two made their way out of the cell, Undertaker and Michaels would just fight each other around and on top of the cell. Michaels soon falls from the side of the cage & through the announce table after trying to escape from the Underaker. After Kane makes his debut and Tombstones the Undertaker, HBK becomes victorious in the first Hell In A Cell Match. This match is something to see if already haven't. 5/5

Raw (June 15, 1998)
Kane & Mankind w/ Paul Bearer Vs. WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker - This was more of a segment than anything else. Stone Cold leads Mankind and Kane outside the cell to leave the Undertaker and Paul Bearer all alone inside the locked structure. Inside the locked structure, Undertaker just beats the holy hell out of a bloody Paul Bearer while leaving Stone Cold fighting Kane and Mankind on the outside. Kane trys to climb the cell to get in before Austin meets him up there. They do not show us the after math once Raw went off the air and it aint really worth rating.

King Of The Ring (June 28, 1998)
Undertaker Vs. Mankind - This is probably the most known and memorable Hell in a Cell match of all-time and mainly because of Mankind being thrown off the cell. After being chokeslammed and thrown off the cell, Mankind and Undertaker delivers a pretty brutal match. Thumb tacks, steel steps, and chairs all gets involved. After being chokslammed onto thumb tacks, Undertaker Tombstones Mankind to pick up his first ever Hell In A Cell victory. Foley certainly gets a well deserved standing ovation after the match. 5/5

Raw (August 24, 1998)
Mankind Vs. Kane - Just like the match from King Of The Ring, Kane and Mankind starts this match off on the outside where Foley gets beaten up by both Kane and the Undertaker and also falls from the cell through the announce table. Kane and Mankind both takes some hard chair shots to the head. Thumb tacks also gets brought into this match. After Stone Cold Steve Austin interferes from under the ring, the match gets stopped. A match that's worth a watch. 4/5

No Way Out (February 27, 2000)
WWE Champion Triple H Vs. Cactus Jack - Not only was this match for HHH's WWE Title but Mick Foley's career was also in jeopardy if Mick Foley lost this match. The match itself was just as brutal and punishable as Foley's & HHH's Street Fight was from the Royal Rumble a month earlier. After Foley and the Game got out of the cell, the match would only get more violent around and on top of the cell. After once again falling from the cell and through the announce table, Foley brings out his famous barbed wire 2x4 and sets it on fire. After setting the 2x4 on fire, Foley gets backdropped through the cell and crashes through the ring followed by a Pedigree from HHH. Just like from the KOTR, Mick Foley gets a well deserved ovation after the match. And for the trivia buffs out there this is the first Hell in a Cell match where a WWE Title was defended in. 5/5

Armageddon (December 20, 2000)
Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle Vs. Triple H Vs. The Rock Vs. Rikishi Vs. The Undertaker - This has to be the wildest, craziest, & most action packed HIAC match of all time. There is action everywhere in this match. McMahon comes out and frees everybody from the cell and then all hell breaks loose everywhere. We even see a Wrestlemania X-Seven preview from Austin and the Rock. This was just a huge and tremendous match. Awesome Hell in a Cell match. 5/5

Judgment Day (May 19, 2002)
Triple H Vs. Chris Jericho - HHH and Jericho by far made up for their lousy match they had at Wrestlemania X8. Jericho takes one of the most brutal beatings ever inside a Hell in the Cell Match. Jericho tried to be tough but I think the cell got to him in this match. A ladder gets briefly used along with a steel chair, ring steps, & a sledgehammer. After being let loose, Triple H & Jericho battles all around the cell and soon make their way on top where HHH brings up with him a barbed wire 2x4. The match ends on top of the cell after Jericho gets Pedigreed by HHH. Watch out for Tim White getting up close and personal to the cell. 4.5/5

No Mercy (October 20, 2002)
WWE Champion Brock Lesnar Vs. Undertaker - Get ready to see a bloodbath because that is exactly what this HIAC Match is. Undertaker & Brock Lesnar shows everybody how violent & sedistic a Hell in the Cell Match can be. Just as brutal and sedistic fighting only inside the cell and not out. Undertaker bleed buckets in this match. Lesnar & Undertaker both uses the cell and other things around them very effectively on each other. Possibably the best Hell In A Cell Match in history. 5/5

Bad Blood (June 15, 2003)
Kevin Nash Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Triple H - Kevin Nash wasn't really getting over with the fans as WWE thought he would so they brought in Mick Foley to be the Special Guest Referee for this HIAC match. This isn't as bad as people say it is. I felt this HIAC is very violent and brutal. All men bleeds in this one including Foley. Not the best Hell in a Cell Match but definitely not the worst. 4/5

Bad Blood (June 13, 2004)
Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels - You better get ready to take a deep seat because Michaels and HHH tears each other to shreds for nearly one hour in the sedistic Hell In a Cell. HBK and HHH both takes a lot of punishment and a bloody beating from each other. This was a fantastic way to end this feud. Arguably the best Hell in a Cell match ever. This match was just off the charts. 5/5

Vengeance (June 26, 2005)
World Heavyweight Champion Batista Vs. Triple H - HHH and Batista told anincredible story here in this HIAC match. HHH is a guy that brings out the best in Batista and HHH did an fantastic job here in doing so. Everything you expect in a Hell in the Cell match and more takes place. Batista gets very physical in this match. He uses everything HHH brings out against him and more. This is a sedistic match where HHH has to take time off from afterwards. This HIAC match could also be the best ever. 5/5

Armageddon (December 18, 2005)
Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - Other reviewers point out that this HIAC match resembles more of a No Holds Barred than a true Hell in the Cell Match but I disagree with that. Undertaker and Orton provided the fans a sedistic and a very harsh match to watch. A lot of physicality is apart of this HIAC match. Orton pulls off some impressive counters to the Undertaker. Orton also takes one of the most vicious beatings from the Deadman along with two of the most hardest steel chair shots I have ever seen. A table gets introduced as well and so does some steel steps in this match. The interference from Bob Orton wasn't really needed but I felt this Hell in a Cell match was great. Another big time HIAC match. 5/5

Unforgiven (September 17, 2006)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince, Shane McMahon, & ECW Champion Big Show - A new Hell In A Cell structure was introduced for this match. Great usage with the cell and the weapons that were used such as a sledgehammer & steel chairs are used very effectively in this HIAC match. It has a vicious and sickening ending with HHH breaking a sledgehammer on the back on Mr. McMahon. This is another hellacious match. 5/5

Survivor Series (November 18, 2007)
Undertaker Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Batista - The new amplified version of the Hell In A Cell continued here as the Undertaker & Batista ended their nealry year long feud. Undertaker is another guy that brings out the best in Batista and this was a tremendous match. Not a whole lot of weapons used but the ones that were, Undertaker & Batista uses them very effectively. They could have used the cell more but it was still good. The ending and the post-match beat down from Edge is something to check out and it really added more to the match. 5/5

Hell In A Cell is called the Devil's Structure and every match from this set displays why. This is an awesome set to add to your collection and is HIGHLY recommended.",1224028800,43,9062,4.397971360381861
3071285,5,B00120LPQK,"Just like Shawn helped make the ladder match a gimmick staple of WWE, he did the same when it came time to have a cage match with Undertaker during their classic 1997 feud when he suggested to Vince to have a cage match with a roof on it. Shawn had remembered a match from the NWA that featured a cage with a roof on it, thus his suggestion became ""Hell in a Cell"".

I won't list the matches, there are enough reviews like that already. Instead, I want to review the actual product. First, the 3-disc collector's package is arguably the best designed packaging WWE has ever released. It's full of stunning high-resolution images that get pretty graphic. When you open the set, you're greeted by 2 gory full panel photos of Triple H and Batista respectively from their battles within the HIAC.
The DVD is hosted by the now departed Mick Foley (he's now on the mess of a promotion called TNA) who does an excellent job introducing the matches and giving informative analysis of HIAC's most memorable moments. On a side note, it's a real shame that the way Vince would rattle Mick in his Smackdown headset during tv tapings lead to his departure from the promotion he played a major part in helping to make Vince the undisputed top promotion in the US during the Monday night wars. Here's hoping Mick will get to come back and get the respect he deserves.
Each match also includes a video package recapping the events leading up to the match. I love this, because these packages bring back a lot of memories for me personally and give the context needed for new viewers to understand the reason why these matches were booked in the first place.
As for the matches, I can't imagine anyone having anything to complain about here. This is the best of the best. Most of these matches I already have on other DVDs, but decided to buy this for 4 rare HIAC matches, 3 of which are making their DVD debut. You get two HIAC matches from Monday Night RAW that most fans may have forgotten about. One is pretty much just an angle and not a real match ( Stone Cold Steve Austin and Undertaker vs. Mankind and Kane ), but the second, Mankind vs. Kane, is actually pretty good. Some people may find it odd that RAW aired these matches, instead of saving them for PPV, but they took place at the height of the Monday night war when ratings were king and hot-shot booking was common for both WWF and WCW. During his match with Kane, Mick takes some sick bumps on free tv. I'm talking about the kind of bumps that make you shake your head in their excess and risk. Although nothing like his infamous HIAC match with Undertaker, Mick's HIAC with Kane is worth seeking out. Another rare match, making it's DVD debut, is the six-man battle inside HIAC from Armageddon 2000. At the time, the match didn't get over very well because people didn't think it's stunt bumps measured up to previous HIAC matches, but now that WWE has conditioned fans not to expect cage dives in HIAC anymore, the match can be enjoyed for what it was, an all-out action packed match from bell-to-bell. Kurt Angle, The Rock, Triple H, Steve Austin, Undertaker and Rikishi (of all people) put on one hell of a match. Austin and Rock in particular get to shine in this one. Finally, the last rare match worth seeking this DVD set out for, is the hard to get Triple H vs. Chris Jericho HIAC match from Judgement Day 2002. The Judgement Day 2002 DVD was quickly pulled after it's release I think because of legal issues over the use of the old WWF scratch logo which partly appears in the event, even though the company had already changed their name to WWE by the time this event aired on PPV. The DVD was later briefly released by a Canadian distributor called Koch and copies of this event were selling for outrageous prices both here and on rival auction sites. So, finally this great match from that event is available on DVD again for a reasonable price. This match marks the end of Tim White's ref career, when he took two hard bumps and was never physically able to referee again. Both Triple H and Jericho give it their all and it marks the first time a HIAC match ended with the decision taking place on top of the cell!
As for the rest of the matches, if you haven't seen them they're worth going out of your way to see. I was glad to see my favorite HIAC match included here, which is Brock Lesnar vs Undertaker. In my opinion, no other HIAC has been able to top this one for both it's storytelling and athleticism. The action is brutal, stiff and believable. Taker also does one of the sickest blade jobs I've ever seen in WWE during this match, surpassed only by Eddie Guerrero's graphic blade job where he bled buckets during his title match with JBL from Judgement Day 2004. Both Lesnar and Taker deliver a classic match here that if you've never seen it, is guaranteed to blow you away.

So, if you're a long time fan like myself, and have seen most of these matches or own them on other DVDs, you may want to skip this release, but I think it's worth picking up for the rare RAW HIAC matches and the six-man match from Armageddon, all making their DVD debut here. If you're a recent fan and new to wrestling, then this is a must buy that will leave you speechless numerous times, by the sheer brutality that the HIAC matches are famous for.",1223942400,,5306,4.429887410440123
3071286,2,B00120LPQK,this wasan't the best wwe DVD I've seen at all I mean yeah they did include all of the Hell in a Cell matches from 1997-2007 but however there was one Hell in a Cell match that they left out and that was Undertaker vs edge Hell in a Cell match from this year's SummerSlam pay per view overall I wouldn't reccomend this DVD to other people maybe my favorite wrestler Randy Orton should have a profile DVD from his life growing up to where he is right now Randy Orton deserves to have a DVD out one about his life that is and I would've wanted to know if the Hell in a Cell match between undertaker and edge was included in this three disc set but it's not included in this three disc DVD set at all I really hope they do a Randy Orton DVD.,1223596800,2,738,3.9932432432432434
3071287,5,B00120LPQK,"but i really wish that the Hell in a Cell match that Edge and Undertaker had at the Summerslam 2008 PPV somehow makes it in the collection. If not this collection, i hope that it at least makes on the upcoming Edge dvd (which i'm ecstatic over).",1219017600,,245,4.23404255319149
3071288,5,B00120LPQK,"It's the most demonic structure in WWE and careers have been permanently altered by its unforgiving steel. Some of the biggest Superstars in WWE history, including Shawn Michaels, Mankind, Undertaker, Triple H, Batista and more, have had signature moments in the Cell. Now, for the first time, fans can watch the greatest Hell in a Cell matches in WWE history in this collector's set, hosted by Mick Foley.

This match listing is accurate and I hope that I helped.  Have a good day!",1217980800,18,2418,4.644549763033176
3071289,5,B00120LPQK,"This match has shorted careers & eventually ended them for not just wrestlers but anyone around including referees. Relive the memories of the infamous Hell In The Cell match on DVD.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Due to how out of hand their previous match got, Undertaker once again made history by being the first participant in a new innovative match...Hell In A Cell. This set the standard for future Cell matches & for being the first one, this was really something to watch. They dished out heavy punishment like never before & used everything they could get their hands on such as the steel steps & chairs to the point where Shawn was bleeding so much that his face would be what Gordon Solie called a ""crimson mask."" Shawn's fall towards the end would later be heavily overshadowed by Mankind's fall less than a year later but still one of the biggest highlights in Cell history along with the debut of Undertaker's brother, Kane. This was something to see for that time...and still is something to see to this day.
In Your House: Bad Blood 97
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Kane & Mankind - This was more of a segment than an actual match as Austin brawled on the outside of the Cell with Mankind & on the top with Kane while Undertaker took his liberties with Paul Bearer locked inside the cell.
""RAW"" June 98
[Best Of RAW: Vol. 1 & 2]

Undertaker vs. Mankind - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.
King Of The Ring 98
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Best Of King Of The Ring; OMG: Top 50 Moments]

Mankind vs. Kane - This is the most unusual setting for this type of match as Kane & Mankind were the Tag Team Champions at this time but earlier in the night, Kane revealed his alliance with Undertaker & turned on Mankind in the process.  Mankind tried to climb to the top of the cell right from the start & throwing chairs onto the top of the cage (with some missing & landing on J.R. & King at the announce table in the process) but referees kept stopping him based off what happened last time before Mankind still tried to climb only to Taker to pull him down through the spanish table.  When Mankind finally got back in the match, it was all about him taking punishment as his head was heavily attacked from it being slammed in the door to various chairshots & even taking a tombstone on the chair.  However in the end, it was all about a promise made earlier in the night being fulfilled.
""RAW"" Aug 98

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match.  Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen.  Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process.  Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board.  From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall.  This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who take take the punishment as well as dish it.
No Way Out 00
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H vs. Rikishi - This was the first (and to date, only) time that we had a multiple men competing in a cell match with Kurt Angle making himself the odd man out by attacking everyone at some point in the week leading up to this match.  This match was exactly what you expected with all of these men here in that it was absolutely all over the place with all four of these men but things got even crazier with Mr. McMahon (who didn't want this match to happen) coming to ringside with a truck attempting to take down the cell piece by piece but only got as far as ripping the door off the cell.  Other various highlights & moments happened throughout the match like Triple H's head bring grinded across the all four sides of the cell causing him to bleed, everyone escaping the cell & brawling all over the set with Triple H having ""the boom"" dropped on him & catapulted onto a car while Austin went headfirst through the a window, Taker & Angle brawling at ringside with the ringbell hammer being used, and fighting on top of the cell with someone getting a stunner while someone else took the fall off the cage, and action in the ring that really picked up when Rock & Austin locked eyes in the ring.  This can be perfectly summed up with Lawler's comment at the end, ""Look at all this carnage!""
Armageddon 00
[The Attitude Era]

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Almost a year later after Triple H injured his quad in a match against Jericho, they meet here in Jericho's first cell match.  They started off wrestling against each other before Jericho got more aggressive using the steps to catapult Triple H into the cell while also using the cell & ramming a ladder into Triple H's face in & out of the ring to bust him open.  Triple H was finally able to fight fire with fire as he used weapons like a chair, the steps, and his own sledgehammer against Jericho resulting in Jericho bleeding.  The match started to get so brutal that nobody was safe as referee Tim White was knocked off the apron into the cell at one point before bring thrown into the cell again, assaulted, and bleeding thanks to Jericho to the point where he was heavily injured & didn't referee another match for close to two years later.  Both men eventually made their way outside of the cell with both the cage door & even a table coming into play before the match got taken to & finished at the top of the cell complete with a barbed wire bat that ended up getting stick to one of the heads.  While Triple H & Jericho have had various encounters over the years, this one is definitely one of their best.
Judgment Day 02

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker - Undertaker came into this match with a cast on his hand & wrist due to an injury Brock caused weeks earlier by Brock & used it as a weapon right away against Lesnar to the point that Lesnar was bleeding but Taker also hurt himself in the process. Taker used whatever he could get his hands on against Brock such as being thrown into it various times while his face was grinding against it along with throwing Brock against the steel steps while Heyman tried to get involved on the outside only for him to pay the price to the point where he was busted open as well. Brock came back in a vicious manner using the ringpost & cell to ram Taker before busting him open while also using a chair to eventually break the cast over which effected Taker as we saw later when he tried to lift the steel steps. Both men kept trading momentum beating each other into exhaustion while still being able to counter each others signature moves throughout the match as this overall was a physical war to say the least to the point where everyone involved (including Heyman on the outside of cell) paying the price.
No Mercy 02
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Due to the out of control nature of their previous match, they met in the cell here & due to the career ending injury that referee Tim White had in the previous cell match, Mick Foley returned to the WWE to referee this match.  Nash was dominate here focusing on Triple H's back ramming it into the cell & using a chair before Triple H gained some momentum using his sledgehammer on Nash's knee & head making him bleed before Foley had to forcefully take it away from him.  Triple H continued to dish out the punishment on Nash's head using whatever he could get his hands on from the cell to the steps, a screwdriver, and barbed-wire bat before Nash would later get his receipt using the weapons as well before Triple H continued to use more weapons including a wooden crate & a chair.  This was one of those matches where the environment of the cell made this match way better than it ever could be on it's own as it's no secret how Nash has a limited moveset while was heavily injury prove during this time of his career and the element of Foley being the referee & getting involved at times only added here in a positive way.
Bad Blood 03

Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Triple H heavily focused on Shawn's previously injured back in the early stages with hard whips into the turnbuckle & elbow drops & stomps & British Bulldog's delayed vertical suplex while later also using the environment around him such as a side slam on the chair & backbreaker on an open chair while one moment he rammed Shawn's back into the post & cell & apron back to back.  Triple H continued to punish Shawn causing him to bleed before Shawn got his reciept using  chairshots to bust open Triple H while bring in a ladder & table to beat & inflict punishment like his elbow drop off the ladder onto Triple H on a table.  This was the most unique performance in this type of match as it wasn't one that heavily played on hardcore violence or ""Oh My God!"" moments more than it was just about two men beating each other in physical exhaustion for over 45 minutes.
Bad Blood 04

World Champion Batista vs. Triple H - Their third & final encounter for the World Championship with Batista being in control early before hurting his shoulder hitting the post with Batista being knocked off the apron into the cell shoulder first.  A biker chain came into play with both men on the end of being whipped & choked with it before Batista got real aggressive delivering a spinebuster between the cell & post busting Triple H open as well.  Another weapon was brought into the match in the form of as steel chair wrapped in barbed-wire causing both men to bleed from various parts of the body like the back & face from moves like chairshots, face grinds, powerslam onto it, and even a DDT.  Triple H's sledgehammer was brought into play with both men using it to their advantage while the steel steps were also used to punish.  This was definitely a brutal battle as both men not only dished out physical punishment but also used the various weapons to not only inflict more punishment but tell a story as well.
Vengeance 05
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - After trying to end the WrestleMania streak & involving his father & trying to end Taker's career twice including burning his casket, it all ends here inside Hell In A Cell.  Taker dominated from the start punishing Orton's head & face via chairshots that busted him open, ramming it into the cell, and using the steel steps.  Orton had to resort to an RKO out of nowhere to finally get the advantage & used the steps himself to have Taker bleeding while also using other weapons like a chair & the chair.  Both men traded momentum including Taker using the cell to perform his version of ""Old School"" & even attacking Bob Orton through the cell while Orton was able to use a table & even counter Taker's tombstone into his own.  This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match as it wasn't as brutal, high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.
Armageddon 05
[Undertaker's Deadliest Matches]

D-Generation X vs. Big Show, Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon - This was the first (and to date only) handicap match in this environment while also the debut of the newer & larger Hell In A Cell.  DX was able to keep ""neutralizing"" Big Show in the beginning in order to focus on the McMahons using anything they could get their hands on from the cell itself, which busted them open, to even a screwdriver.  Show was able to help the McMahons get their advantage as they were able to make DX bleed while focusing on Triple H's previously injured ear with moves like the coast to coast with a trash can.  Vince made it clear that he was out to punish DX more than win the match which would only come back to haunt them as Shane would end up having his neck damaged to the point where he was showing internal bleeding, Show being knocked out, and Vince getting a ""taste"" of his own medicine.
Unforgiven 06
[New & Improved D-Generation X]

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker - After each man winning one match in their series while also going to two draws, this is set to be the encounter to determine who's the better man.  Both men started off with impactful moves right out the cage trading clotheslines while Batista executed the spear & Taker with his big boot.  Taker then went on the attack with a chair causing Batista to bleed from the mouth before he recovered with a running powerslam.  They traded momentum with Taker being tossed into the cell followed by a clothesline while Batista was thrown into the steps, the cell & busted open with a chair before Batista made Taker bleed ramming his head into the steps repeatedly.  Both men went back & forth with counters & reversals from the superplex into the triangle choke, the Batista Bomb into a backdrop on the steps, another Batista Bomb through a table, Tombstone on the steel steps, and both men continuing to kick out of each others signature holds.  In the end however, it was the one ""wild card"" in regards to both men & the World Championship that would be the difference maker.  Just like their entire series of matches, this was an awesome encounter.
Survivor Series 07

The only match they left out was the Undertaker/Big Boss Man one from WrestleMania XV but you really aren't missing anything there as that has gone down as the worst one of them all the point where they never showed highlights of that match when doing the video features on the Hell In A Cell Match.  So out of 14 Hell In The Cell matches on here, only 2 of them are ones that would be considered flops & this would be considered an ultimate collection for those who are fans of this match & love violence & brutality. This is one collection I would highly recommend.",1200873600,27,15636,4.416058394160584

3071316,5,B00120LPQK,"Of all the gimmick matches that are in WWE, Hell in a Cell has to be my favorite one. It is a match that never fails to impress me. Nearly all the matches are brutal as they are incredible. This DVD sets lives up to every expectations I had for it. It has almost all the HIAC matches (well not Taker vs. Boss Man) up to 2007. Hardcore Legend Mick Foley hosts this set along with the promos for the feuds for each match.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels- Bad Blood 1997
This was the very first HITC ever. It is a very fast paced match that sets the bar for future HITC matches. Both Taker & HBK take a ton of bumps in this match. A funny bit in this match includes HBK attacking a camera man so the refs can unlock the door so HBK can escape which leads to both men fighting on top of the Cell. Taker gives HBK a big beating in the final moments of the match with some of the hardest chairshot shots ever. Kane makes his WWE debut by breaking down the door and giving Taker a tombstone to cost him his match. This was a fantastic match. It was truly a defining moment for both men.

Kane & Mankind w/ Paul Bearer vs. WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker- RAW IS WAR 1998
As one reviewer has stated already, this was more of a segment than an actual match. But it's still very entertaining nonetheless. Kane & Mankind go outside the Cell to attack Austin. Paul Bearer locks himself in the Cell to protect himself. Boy was he wrong because Undertaker was under the ring waiting for that. Paul Bearer gets a big beat down while Kane tries to find a way in. It's just a fun moment to the DVD.

Undertaker vs. Mankind- King of the Ring 1998
I don't think this match needs any intro. If there is any word to define this match, it's LEGENDARY! It was an intense & brutal match. Mick Foley takes what might be his worst beating in his career! Falling off the 16 feet high Cell is a sight to see. But that doesn't stop him from coming back, only to get chokeslamed THROUGH the cell. But EVEN THAT DOESN'T STOP HIM! Both men truly put on a Hell (no pun intended) of a match. It ends with a crazy thumbtack spot. This match proves two important things. One is that Mick Foley has one of the bravest hearts out of many wrestlers. The other is that Undertaker is the ultimate badass in WWE history!!! A must see match for anyone.

Mankind vs. Kane- RAW IS WAR 1998
A forgotten HITC. This was a fun match, but nowhere near as good as the others. Mankind tries to climb the Cell AGAIN before Undertaker pulls him down which results in Mankind landing on the tables and hitting his head on the floor which looked like it hurt. Both Kane & Mankind pull off a good main event on RAW. The thumbtacks appear again, this time Kane lands on them with his butt. Stone Cold Steve Austin appears in this match and gives Kane a beat down. This was a short but sweet match.

WWE Champion Triple H Vs. Cactus Jack- No Way out 2000
This was not only Triple H's first HITC match, but also the first time the title was on the line in HITC. Both men give us a great main event. A 2x4 wrapped in barbwire makes an appearance and is later set on fire. It is also the first time both wrestlers left the cell through a broken cell wall of instead of the door. There is a nice table spot and Foley falls through the cell again. This time with a more safer landing. It seemed to catch Triple H by surprise too, look at his reacting afterward. This match is what Foley considered his swan song of a match and he got a good send off by the fans. A great match worth seeing.

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Undertaker vs. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H vs. Rikshi- Armageddon 2000
This was the first time ever that Hell in a Cell had not two, but six men fighting each other. It was a truly fantastic match for the attitude era because it has six of the best wrestlers ever in that era. This is one of my all time favorites. It was a wild and crazy match with everyone out to get one another. Some of my favorite parts go from everyone using their famous finishers on each other in 5 minutes, Vinny Mac trying to tear the Cell down, to Undertaker chokeslaming Rikishi off the cell. It's an epic match that never gets boring. A must see!

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho- Judgment Day 2002
The Hell in the Cell had been gone for almost a year, so it was about time for it to make a come back. What better way to bring it back by putting it in the feud between HHH & Y2J. Both men put on a great bout and remains to be one of their best.  A ladder & steel steps come into play. Y2J bumps into ref Tim White and beats the shit out of him. It's a crazy moment with Y2J yelling ""You SOB! You cost me the match!!"" to him. Both Triple H & Y2J go up to the top of the cell where they finish the fight. This makes it the only time where the pin fall happens on top of the Cell.

Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar- No Mercy 2002
This was a very bloody bout. Both men bleed, but Taker gets the worst of it. Heck, even Paul Heyman bleeds. The Cell is used a lot in this match.  But this is the first time neither of them go outside of the Cell to fight on top of it. The whole match takes place inside and it's still fantastic. But Paul Heyman's yelling could get annoying after a while. The ending was great and it was fitting to this match.

Triple H vs. Kevin Nash w/ Mick Foley as the referee- Bad Blood 2003
Many people hated this match for some reason. I thought it was a great match. Both men beat the crap out of each other.  Mick Foley adds more to this match as he's always ready to count the pin fall on Triple H. All three men bleed in this match and its ending was unpredictable.  Not the very best cell match, but still a great match nonetheless.

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels- Bad Blood 2004
This has to be the longest Hell in the Cell match ever, because this two beat the hell out of each other for an hour. This was truly one of their best bouts behind their last man standing match at Royal Rumble 04. A ladder gets used in this match and as does the Cell. The ending was truly emotional and it was a great way to end their feud. Check it out.

World Champion Batista vs. Triple H- Vengeance 2005
This was the final encounter of this men starting from Wrestlemania 21. It was a brutal match for the World Heavyweight Title. Both men bring a ton of weapons here and both bleed a lot. This match was made to truly put Batista over and it did it well. The ending was epic as Triple H attempts to hit Batista with the sledgehammer as he's being power bombed. Great match!

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton- Armageddon 2005
After being attacked for the whole year by Orton, Taker had enough as decided to finish at in the match he made famous. This might be their best match together as it was brutal and fast paced. Randy Orton takes some very nasty chair shots by Taker and a table comes into play. It had a ton of reversals like Orton giving Taker a tombstone.  This match also had the door open since Triple H vs. YJ2 in 2002. Randy's father gets involved only to get beaten down by Undertaker.  The ending is also an epic way to end their long ""Legend vs. Legend Killer"" feud that started at Wrestlemania 21. Don't pass this up, it's a great match.

DX (Triple H & Shawn Michaels) vs. Big Show and the McMahons (Vince & Shane) - Unforgiven 2006
This match famously introduced the new 20 feet tall Cell which is still being used today.  This has to be the best of DX's matches together since they returned together. This bout was brutal as Vince, Shane & Big Show dominated DX for a good portion before they came back. The ending to this match was funny as DX shoves Vince's face up Big Show butt. I'm serious!!  This was a great bout and a good way to end the feud between Vince & DX.

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker- Survivor Series 2007
Anytime these two men were paired together, it turns to gold. This was a great way to end their year long feud. Both men really beat the crap out of each other and they were always on the same page. There were many close calls and it was an unpredictable bout.  Edge makes an appearance which adds to the match but might disappoint some because it didn't end clean. But this was still a great match between these two forces of destruction and it might be their best match.

I feel like this DVD should have included Undertaker vs. Edge at Summerslam 2008. That was also a damn good match and would have been a great way to finish this DVD. But you can get that in Undertaker's Deadliest Matches DVD, so it's ok. I also wish there was more special features like in ring segments that involved the Cell.  Mick Foley's comments on each match are fantastic and he seemed like he had fun with it. This is a must buy DVD from WWE and Hell in a Cell is one of the best. Don't pass it up, get ASAP!!!!",1346025600,4,8813,4.151817116060961
3071317,5,B00120LPQK,"This match has shorted careers & eventually ended them for not just wrestlers but anyone around including referees. Relive the memories of the infamous Hell In The Cell match on DVD.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Due to how out of hand their previous match got, Undertaker once again made history by being the first participant in a new innovative match...Hell In A Cell. This set the standard for future Cell matches & for being the first one, this was really something to watch. They dished out heavy punishment like never before & used everything they could get their hands on such as the steel steps & chairs to the point where Shawn was bleeding so much that his face would be what Gordon Solie called a ""crimson mask."" Shawn's fall towards the end would later be heavily overshadowed by Mankind's fall less than a year later but still one of the biggest highlights in Cell history along with the debut of Undertaker's brother, Kane. This was something to see for that time...and still is something to see to this day.
In Your House: Bad Blood 97
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Kane & Mankind - This was more of a segment than an actual match as Austin brawled on the outside of the Cell with Mankind & on the top with Kane while Undertaker took his liberties with Paul Bearer locked inside the cell.
""RAW"" June 98
[Best Of RAW: Vol. 1 & 2]

Undertaker vs. Mankind - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.
King Of The Ring 98
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Best Of King Of The Ring; OMG: Top 50 Moments]

Mankind vs. Kane - This is the most unusual setting for this type of match as Kane & Mankind were the Tag Team Champions at this time but earlier in the night, Kane revealed his alliance with Undertaker & turned on Mankind in the process.  Mankind tried to climb to the top of the cell right from the start & throwing chairs onto the top of the cage (with some missing & landing on J.R. & King at the announce table in the process) but referees kept stopping him based off what happened last time before Mankind still tried to climb only to Taker to pull him down through the spanish table.  When Mankind finally got back in the match, it was all about him taking punishment as his head was heavily attacked from it being slammed in the door to various chairshots & even taking a tombstone on the chair.  However in the end, it was all about a promise made earlier in the night being fulfilled.
""RAW"" Aug 98

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match.  Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen.  Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process.  Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board.  From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall.  This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who take take the punishment as well as dish it.
No Way Out 00
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H vs. Rikishi - This was the first (and to date, only) time that we had a multiple men competing in a cell match with Kurt Angle making himself the odd man out by attacking everyone at some point in the week leading up to this match.  This match was exactly what you expected with all of these men here in that it was absolutely all over the place with all four of these men but things got even crazier with Mr. McMahon (who didn't want this match to happen) coming to ringside with a truck attempting to take down the cell piece by piece but only got as far as ripping the door off the cell.  Other various highlights & moments happened throughout the match like Triple H's head bring grinded across the all four sides of the cell causing him to bleed, everyone escaping the cell & brawling all over the set with Triple H having ""the boom"" dropped on him & catapulted onto a car while Austin went headfirst through the a window, Taker & Angle brawling at ringside with the ringbell hammer being used, and fighting on top of the cell with someone getting a stunner while someone else took the fall off the cage, and action in the ring that really picked up when Rock & Austin locked eyes in the ring.  This can be perfectly summed up with Lawler's comment at the end, ""Look at all this carnage!""
Armageddon 00
[The Attitude Era]

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Almost a year later after Triple H injured his quad in a match against Jericho, they meet here in Jericho's first cell match.  They started off wrestling against each other before Jericho got more aggressive using the steps to catapult Triple H into the cell while also using the cell & ramming a ladder into Triple H's face in & out of the ring to bust him open.  Triple H was finally able to fight fire with fire as he used weapons like a chair, the steps, and his own sledgehammer against Jericho resulting in Jericho bleeding.  The match started to get so brutal that nobody was safe as referee Tim White was knocked off the apron into the cell at one point before bring thrown into the cell again, assaulted, and bleeding thanks to Jericho to the point where he was heavily injured & didn't referee another match for close to two years later.  Both men eventually made their way outside of the cell with both the cage door & even a table coming into play before the match got taken to & finished at the top of the cell complete with a barbed wire bat that ended up getting stick to one of the heads.  While Triple H & Jericho have had various encounters over the years, this one is definitely one of their best.
Judgment Day 02

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker - Undertaker came into this match with a cast on his hand & wrist due to an injury Brock caused weeks earlier by Brock & used it as a weapon right away against Lesnar to the point that Lesnar was bleeding but Taker also hurt himself in the process. Taker used whatever he could get his hands on against Brock such as being thrown into it various times while his face was grinding against it along with throwing Brock against the steel steps while Heyman tried to get involved on the outside only for him to pay the price to the point where he was busted open as well. Brock came back in a vicious manner using the ringpost & cell to ram Taker before busting him open while also using a chair to eventually break the cast over which effected Taker as we saw later when he tried to lift the steel steps. Both men kept trading momentum beating each other into exhaustion while still being able to counter each others signature moves throughout the match as this overall was a physical war to say the least to the point where everyone involved (including Heyman on the outside of cell) paying the price.
No Mercy 02
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Due to the out of control nature of their previous match, they met in the cell here & due to the career ending injury that referee Tim White had in the previous cell match, Mick Foley returned to the WWE to referee this match.  Nash was dominate here focusing on Triple H's back ramming it into the cell & using a chair before Triple H gained some momentum using his sledgehammer on Nash's knee & head making him bleed before Foley had to forcefully take it away from him.  Triple H continued to dish out the punishment on Nash's head using whatever he could get his hands on from the cell to the steps, a screwdriver, and barbed-wire bat before Nash would later get his receipt using the weapons as well before Triple H continued to use more weapons including a wooden crate & a chair.  This was one of those matches where the environment of the cell made this match way better than it ever could be on it's own as it's no secret how Nash has a limited moveset while was heavily injury prove during this time of his career and the element of Foley being the referee & getting involved at times only added here in a positive way.
Bad Blood 03

Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Triple H heavily focused on Shawn's previously injured back in the early stages with hard whips into the turnbuckle & elbow drops & stomps & British Bulldog's delayed vertical suplex while later also using the environment around him such as a side slam on the chair & backbreaker on an open chair while one moment he rammed Shawn's back into the post & cell & apron back to back.  Triple H continued to punish Shawn causing him to bleed before Shawn got his reciept using  chairshots to bust open Triple H while bring in a ladder & table to beat & inflict punishment like his elbow drop off the ladder onto Triple H on a table.  This was the most unique performance in this type of match as it wasn't one that heavily played on hardcore violence or ""Oh My God!"" moments more than it was just about two men beating each other in physical exhaustion for over 45 minutes.
Bad Blood 04

World Champion Batista vs. Triple H - Their third & final encounter for the World Championship with Batista being in control early before hurting his shoulder hitting the post with Batista being knocked off the apron into the cell shoulder first.  A biker chain came into play with both men on the end of being whipped & choked with it before Batista got real aggressive delivering a spinebuster between the cell & post busting Triple H open as well.  Another weapon was brought into the match in the form of as steel chair wrapped in barbed-wire causing both men to bleed from various parts of the body like the back & face from moves like chairshots, face grinds, powerslam onto it, and even a DDT.  Triple H's sledgehammer was brought into play with both men using it to their advantage while the steel steps were also used to punish.  This was definitely a brutal battle as both men not only dished out physical punishment but also used the various weapons to not only inflict more punishment but tell a story as well.
Vengeance 05
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - After trying to end the WrestleMania streak & involving his father & trying to end Taker's career twice including burning his casket, it all ends here inside Hell In A Cell.  Taker dominated from the start punishing Orton's head & face via chairshots that busted him open, ramming it into the cell, and using the steel steps.  Orton had to resort to an RKO out of nowhere to finally get the advantage & used the steps himself to have Taker bleeding while also using other weapons like a chair & the chair.  Both men traded momentum including Taker using the cell to perform his version of ""Old School"" & even attacking Bob Orton through the cell while Orton was able to use a table & even counter Taker's tombstone into his own.  This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match as it wasn't as brutal, high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.
Armageddon 05
[Undertaker's Deadliest Matches]

D-Generation X vs. Big Show, Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon - This was the first (and to date only) handicap match in this environment while also the debut of the newer & larger Hell In A Cell.  DX was able to keep ""neutralizing"" Big Show in the beginning in order to focus on the McMahons using anything they could get their hands on from the cell itself, which busted them open, to even a screwdriver.  Show was able to help the McMahons get their advantage as they were able to make DX bleed while focusing on Triple H's previously injured ear with moves like the coast to coast with a trash can.  Vince made it clear that he was out to punish DX more than win the match which would only come back to haunt them as Shane would end up having his neck damaged to the point where he was showing internal bleeding, Show being knocked out, and Vince getting a ""taste"" of his own medicine.
Unforgiven 06
[New & Improved D-Generation X]

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker - After each man winning one match in their series while also going to two draws, this is set to be the encounter to determine who's the better man.  Both men started off with impactful moves right out the cage trading clotheslines while Batista executed the spear & Taker with his big boot.  Taker then went on the attack with a chair causing Batista to bleed from the mouth before he recovered with a running powerslam.  They traded momentum with Taker being tossed into the cell followed by a clothesline while Batista was thrown into the steps, the cell & busted open with a chair before Batista made Taker bleed ramming his head into the steps repeatedly.  Both men went back & forth with counters & reversals from the superplex into the triangle choke, the Batista Bomb into a backdrop on the steps, another Batista Bomb through a table, Tombstone on the steel steps, and both men continuing to kick out of each others signature holds.  In the end however, it was the one ""wild card"" in regards to both men & the World Championship that would be the difference maker.  Just like their entire series of matches, this was an awesome encounter.
Survivor Series 07

The only match they left out was the Undertaker/Big Boss Man one from WrestleMania XV but you really aren't missing anything there as that has gone down as the worst one of them all the point where they never showed highlights of that match when doing the video features on the Hell In A Cell Match.  So out of 14 Hell In The Cell matches on here, only 2 of them are ones that would be considered flops & this would be considered an ultimate collection for those who are fans of this match & love violence & brutality. This is one collection I would highly recommend.",1334880000,3,15636,4.416058394160584

3071319,5,B00120LPQK,"This is quite possibly the best DVD product WWE has ever produced.  I have a collection of over 40 events and collections, and this is easily my favorite.  The 3-disc set features all of the great HIAC matches over a decade, with the exception of a few.  Mick Foley is quite possibly the only person qualified to host/present the matches. The matches on the set are:

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels (Bad Blood- 1997)
Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Mankind & Kane (Raw- June, 1998)
Undertaker vs. Mankind (King of the Ring- 1998)
Mankind vs. Kane (Raw- August, 1998)
Triple H vs. Cactus Jack (No Way Out- 2000)
Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi vs. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H (Armageddon- 2000)
Triple H vs. Chris Jericho (Judgement Day- 2002)
Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar (No Mercy- 2002)
Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (Bad Blood- 2003)
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels (Bad Blood- 2004)
Triple H vs. Batista (Vengeance- 2005)
Undertaker vs. Randy Orton (Armageddon- 2005)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels (D-Generation X) vs. Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon & Big Show (Unforgiven- 2006)
Undertaker vs. Batista (Survivor Series- 2007)

Every match in this set is brilliant, with of course a few standouts: Taker/Michaels, Taker/Mankind, HHH/Michaels.  I'm going to keep this brief and just mention that this video speaks for itself.  Relive all the great HIAC moments of the past, and save yourself from the present ""family friendly"" product, and the ridiculous HIAC gimmicked PPV.",1318809600,,1496,4.983935742971887
3071320,5,B00120LPQK,"The Hell In Cell. It's been called Satan's Structure, The Devil's Playground & The Deadman's Playground. All names appropriately describe the Cell. And this set has every IAC match that ever took place with the only 2 exceptions being Al Snow vs Bossman in the Kennel From Hell match & Taker vs Bossman at WM15. IMO, while this is a very solid set, they should have waited. I'll explain why later.

Host: Appropriately enough, Mick Foley.

Bad Blood (October 5, 1997) - Taker & HBK made history here. Taker himself said in 2003 that this is the favorite match of his career. Has that changed since then? I don't know. But this was a damn good match. This was also the debut of Kane. Worth multiple viewings.

Raw (June 15, 1998)
Kane & Mankind w/ Paul Bearer Vs. WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker - This isn't a match though it was supposed to be. What ended up happening was after Paul locked himself in the casket & Taker's music played (he never came out so SC had to fend for himself), He (being Paul) stood in the ring & Taker popped from underneath & just beat the hell out of him. He even used the steps on him! Kane tried it but couldn't so he climbed to the top. SC shortly after went there & just attacked Kane.

King Of The Ring (June 28, 1998)
Undertaker Vs. Mankind - History was remade here. This is still a talked about match after 13 years. They really set a new bar here. This is worth multiple viewings as the first one is.

Raw (August 24, 1998)
Mankind Vs. Kane - I wished this had a true winner. But this was made to further Kane & Mankind's separation to further SC's storyline with Taker. SC said he'd get one of them before the night was over & he interfered, as his target was Kane, which ended the match. Taker responded to this. That should have been an extra.

No Way Out (February 27, 2000)
WWE Champion Triple H Vs. Cactus Jack - A memorable match. Foley's career was supposed to be on the line. I say that because at this time, it was. But since he competed many times following this, that stipulation doesn't mean anything. I remember this for the backdrop that sent Foley crashing through the ring. Great match.

Armageddon (December 20, 2000)
Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle Vs. Triple H Vs. The Rock Vs. Rikishi Vs. The Undertaker - This happened at a ppv that was appropriately named Armageddon because that's exactly what this was. All men bled, Rikishi went from the top of the Cell onto the back of a truck, action everywhere. What more do you want in a match?

Judgment Day (May 19, 2002)
Triple H Vs. Chris Jericho - Not my favorite match. The effort was there though. Probably didn't like this or their Wm18 bout because to me, their best matches happened in 2000.

No Mercy (October 20, 2002)
Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar - Man, Taker really & I mean LITERALLY, he REALLY SOLD here! Never have I ever seen anyone with so much blood on them. He had a broken arm, bled like crazy & still seemed like he could win yet at the same time, he managed to put Lesnar over. After the match, Lesnar stood on top of the Cell with the Title & Taker looked on & when I saw those eyes, I thought he'd retire. So glad he didn't. Not only because if he did, we wouldn't see his awesome year long feuds with Orton, Batista & Edge, but more importantly because Lesnar doesn't deserve the right to retire Taker. No one does.

Bad Blood (June 15, 2003)
Kevin Nash Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Triple H - I was excited to see Nash return. That is, till I saw this match. Their match at Judgment Day was ok as was his match. I guess since WWE felt Nash didn't get over & wasn't really the man he was when he was Diesel, they brought in the right guy to referee a HIAC match, Mick Foley. Foley made this match for me.

Bad Blood (June 13, 2004)
Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels - A great match. I still think the first 2 HIAC matches are the best even to this day. But this was very good. They really took it to each other. And I thought their Last man Standing match at the Royal Rumble couldn't be topped. Well, maybe it wasn't. And if not, this ties with that match.

Vengeance (June 26, 2005)
World Heavyweight Champion Batista Vs. Triple H - I was never a big fan of HHH after his DX days & was never a fan of Batista till his feuds with Edge & Taker. But I'll credit both men. They told a great story here. Worth a watch.

Armageddon (December 18, 2005)
Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - Wow. I haven't seen Taker this way since the first 2 HIAC matches & I don't think I've seen him this way since this match happened. If you wanna see a sadistic, bloody HIAC match, then this is for you. Not only was the Cell used as a weapon. But a chair, a table & the Urn were also used. It's said that Taker was upset that Bob Orton didn't tell him he had Hepatitis. I think Orton was released afterwards & Taker took off till he appeared at the 2006 Royal Rumble to challenge Kurt Angle for the WHC.

Unforgiven (September 17, 2006)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince, Shane McMahon, & ECW Champion Big Show - Can't say I was a big fan of this. SO much so that i don't remember it since watching it for the first time when I first watched this dvd.

Survivor Series (November 18, 2007)
Undertaker Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Batista - I really enjoyed this. Taker just seems to bring something out of Batista that not even HHH was able to do. Everytime he faces Taker, Batista just gets this new unexplainable life. That's just a testament to the asset Taker is. The aftermath really adds to this already great match.

Like I said, while this is a very solid set that's worth the purchase, I wish they waited to release this as the HIAC matches are still going. They left out the SSlam 2008 HIAC match with Taker & Edge which was the standout for me as I was there live, front row to witness Taker's return. It sucks i had to buy the SSlam 2998 dvd just for that. Cena vs Batista was a great match too. But Taker/Edge was the real highlight for me & had that been on here, I could've saved.....don't remember exactly but between $20 - $30. Still, buy this set if you haven't yet along with the Elimination Chamber set which I'll review soon.",1310169600,,6187,4.284246575342466
3071321,4,B00120LPQK,"With nine hours of matches on the DVDs, it's hard to go wrong.  Of course there is the classic Foley vs. Mankind match, and the first HIAC match with Taker and Michaels.  Personally, I can't stand Triple H so his ridiculous DX match did nothing for me.  It just reminded me of a horrible era in WWE, which continues to this day.  However, his match with Nash is surprisingly decent.  Another surprisingly good match was Batista vs. Taker.

Not all of the matches are classic, but none are terrible.  It's too bad that WWE ran this gimmick into the ground with the unnecessary Hell in a Cell pay per view, as it was hands down their coolest match for a few years.

Would have been nice to have some special features, but Foley does a good job at hosting.  If you like Hell in a Cell, don't see any reason why not to pick it up.",1297468800,2,826,4.243589743589744

3071325,5,B00120LPQK,"Hell in a Cell lives up to its nicknames, out of every variation of a cage match, this match is truely demonic and brutal. I mean look at its track record, or careers shortened. Its the only cage match with no stipulations, its just a very hardcore match within a 25 ft (or so cage).

Now as for the dvd. Its on 3 discs and includes almost every Hell in a cell from Michaels/Taker to Taker/Batista. The only ones in between that were left out were Taker/Bossman and Snow/Bossman (although it technically wasn't and it was one of the worst matches ever). Before each match, Mick Foley does an intro within a mini hell in a cell enclosed in a studio and they show clips of the events leading into them.

The Hell in a cells that are included are:

Taker vs Michaels (Bad Blood 97): Possibly one the greatest HIAC matches, this set the bar for all Cell matches to come. 5 out of 5

Taker/Austin vs Kane/Mankind (Raw 98): Wasnt really a match, all it was Austin fighting Mankind and Kane outside of the cell and Taker beating the living hell out of Paul Bearer. The bell was never even rung. Was really a filler for the dvd, half decent since Bearer got bloodied. 2.5/5

Taker vs Mankind (King of the ring 98)- Now this was the greatest, since it was really brutal for Mankind, this match gave Foley one of his distinct looks...his missing front teeth. It possibly had the biggest ""Oh My God"" moment in wrestling history. 5/5

Kane vs Mankind (Raw 98): Like the tag team match, this is pretty much a filler, although unlike the tag this did officially start and was an actual match. It did however end in a no descion and had its moments. 3.5/5

HHH vs Cactus Jack (No Way Out 00): This was Mick Foley's last HIAC he would wrestle in and was it memorable. Sure it wasn't no where as impact as the one he fought at KOTR but the match did have its moments, this was HHH's first of many HIAC matches he has had in his career. 4.5/5

6 way- Angle vs HHH vs Rock vs Rikishi vs Taker vs Austin (Armageddon 00): This was another pretty decent match, but most of the damage happened outside of the cell, either near the stage or on top. The match probably would have ended outside but the rules said the descion had to be in the ring. Like most HIAC this had its moments leaving everyone bloody. 4/5

HHH vs Jericho (Judgement day 02): Match was pretty good, this was really Jericho's last real good match for a while. They did whatever you would expect. 3.5/5

Taker vs Lesnar (Survivor Series 02): Now this I had mixed feelings about. It featured at the time 2 of wwe's top stars. Lesnar who combines brute strengh with technical, was really out of his confort zone, the match was of course very bloody and brutal not great but good. 3.5/5

HHH vs Nash (Bad Blood 03): Some say this was the worst non Raw HIAC (excluding Snow/Bossman) since well Nash has very weak knees, even it looked like it was back and forth, it was on sided as it was too predictable. 2/5

HHH vs Michaels (Bad Blood 04): Now this was a great match. Truely the best these two have wrestled in together. Not the best, but to me maybe 3rd best behind Taker/Michaels and Taker/Mankind. 5/5

HHH vs Batista (Vengeance 05): Kind of like Taker/Lesnar, at this point wwe was really trying push Batista and Cena, they gave Batista the title and decided to put him in the cell with HHH. Good overall. 3.5/5

Taker vs Orton (Armageddon 05): Some say this was pretty much a street fight in a HIAC as both men mainly used weapons,even busting Bob Orton open which a lot of people didn't agree with. I have to agree. Sure the match was entertaining and brutal but they could have done more. 4/5

DX vs The McMahons and Big Show (Unforgiven 06): This match had its moments, which one of which you can never forget and thats a bad thing. Brutal as you would expect. 3.5/5

Taker vs Batista (Survivor Series 07). Same as Batista/HHH. It was brutal with brute strengh vs Phenom and had a suprise ending which no one saw coming but it could have been better 3.5/5

Great overall dvd, could have had Taker/Bossman and maybe waited to release so they could add Taker/Edge which was another great one that I would have given a 5/5. Would have excluded the raw tag team one, since nothing really happened.",1272585600,2,4246,4.3816793893129775
3071326,5,B00120LPQK,"Try as I may, I can't imagine a better collection of matches than Hell in a Cell. As much as I'm a mark for behind the scenes, real-life dirt, sometimes you just want to enjoy some great wrestling. Especially now, since it's so difficult to find. I hear great things about some of the current indies, but I only get WWE and TNA, and both products have had poor years creatively. This brutal collection will come as a jolt to those who are conditioned to today's watered-down, for kids only WWE. Every one of the 14 matches contained on this 3-disc set has blood...and occasionally, an absurd amount. Of course, those of us who have been watching for years and enjoy the process behind the theatrics knows that blading creates a psychological effect on an audience, lending an aura of importance. And in the world of pro wrestling, some of these bouts are very important indeed.
The masterpiece, of course, the one match every fan, no matter how big or average, how old or young, needs to own on DVD is the June, 1998 match from the King of the Ring PPV. The combatants: The Undertaker and Mick Foley. What Foley accomplishes in this ultra-violent war will never be duplicated by anyone, not intentionally anyway. The fall from the top of the cage through the announcers table, the unbelievably vicious powerslam through the top of the cage to the mat, and the chokeslam on the masses of thumbtacks are the brutal highlights. Foley's introductions and commentary on each match is just icing.
There are a number of legit 4 to 5 star classics here-Taker vs Michaels, the six-man for the WWE championship, Taker-Lesner, HBK vs Trips, D-X vs. the McMahons and Big Show in a stunningly gruesome handicap match...there's not a dud on this collection. It's also proof ECW wasn't the only promotion delivering the hardcore in the late 90's. If you're already a big fan, you probably own this. If you're just getting started, make this one of your very first purchases, and see what got everyone so rabid about this business.

The compilation of these matches into one place shows how the creative minds in the WWE have worked to keep the HIAC angle fresh and captivating for its audience. Although its most known for Mick Foley's superhuman fall off of the cell in 1998, HIAC has also played host to some great traditional wrestling and even some comedy/squash in addition to the hardcore style that it is most known for.

The format of the DVD is great in that it recaps the feuds that the wrestlers were entangled in leading up to the HIAC match itself, with footage from Raw, SmackDown, and PPV's. As many wrestling fans know, the production value of WWE is top notch. Their video team really exemplifies the drama and the glory of their storylines. The only critique I have of this DVD is that the entire thing is hosted by Mick Foley. I would have loved to see more in-depth interview reactions from more of the wrestlers involved in the matches. For that reason I've got to give the DVD itself 4-stars, although the wrestling material is 5-star by far.",1235433600,,1126,4.519607843137255
3071329,5,B00120LPQK,"Whenever we think of Hell In A Cell there's no doubting that we will all think of the legendary match between the Undertaker and Mick Foley at King of the Ring 1998. The match that literally nearly killed the hardcore legend and personified the most brutal invention by the WWE. Little do many casual wrestling fans know that there have been many more Hell In A Cell matches since that dreaded night. This collection brings almost all of the Hell In A Cell matches in history together for your sick enjoyment.

Hosting this fantastic DVD set is the man who nearly died, the Hardcore Legend, Mick Foley. He tells us the fantastic story of the creation of the Hell In A Cell match and gives us a brief introduction before every match. Mick Foley is a great choice as the host of this DVD as there's no denying that without that very famous match, we wouldn't see as many Hell In A Cell matches follow as they did.

Disc 1

Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels: Badd Blood - October 5th 1997

One amazing WWE debut for this speciality match and a lot of back and forth action between the two, which culminated in a decent spot that landed Shawn Michaels through one of the announce tables. Top that Mick Foley.

Kane & Mankind vs Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer & Stone Cold: Raw - June 15th 1998

I've not seen this match myself, but from what I've heard, it was one of those defining matches and being on Raw gave the HIAC even more exposure for what was to come.

Undertaker vs Mankind: King Of The Ring - June 28th 1998

Well this truly was the defining match that emphasised the sheer brutality of this match. It started off on top of the cell and within the first few minutes, that memorable image happened creating the phrase that JR will always be remembered for ""Good god almighty they killed him."" I don't know who they are, but I certainly felt the same when watching this match. That wasn't the end of it, however, and Mick being Mick wanted more and he got more.

Triple H vs Cactus Jack: No Way Out - February 27th 2000

This was the match that was to retire Mick Foley and bring an end to a long standing feud that saw him get beaten up time and time again.

Kurt Angle vs Stone Cold vs The Rock vs Rikishi vs Undertaker vs Triple H: Armageddon - December 10th 2000

Oh My God, this match is easily one of my favourite matches in WWE history by far. There was an attempt in it to recreate the famous ""oh my god"" moment by having Rikishi thrown off the cell. There were a few brilliant spots and some great action all round with one of the best endings ever.

Disc 2

Triple H vs Chris Jericho: Judgment Day - May 19th 2002

Their Wrestlemania match wasn't brilliant, but this match sure made up for it. Chris Jericho took a real beating in this match and without the insane spots, it showed why this is called the career shortening match.

Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar: No Mercy - October 20th 2002

Brock Lesnar made his debut in WWE at the start of the year and within only a few months became one of the biggest names and the most dominant forces in the WWE. Undertaker wanted to put a stop to that and he thought that job would be much more easier on his home turf of the Cell. Undertaker underestimated Brock and we had a brilliantly brutal back and forth match that cemented Brocks image of being the dominant one.

Triple H vs Kevin Nash: Badd Blood - June 15th 2003

Nothing to shout about really, they had a really good feud and this was a good way to end it. Other than that it's not very memorable.

Triple H vs Shawn Michaels: Badd Blood - June 13th 2004

Well before this initial match they had one hell of a feud which was to come to an end in possibly one of the best and most sadistic matches in the specialities history. They really beat the hell out of each other and it's surprising that they are still able to move today after such a confrontation.

Disc 3

Batista vs Triple H: Vengeance - June 26th 2005

I'm not a massive fan of Batista and really hated the idea of seeing him in a Hell in a Cell match, but thanks to Triple H this match wasn't too bad. A lot of back and forth brutality taking advantage of both superstars strengths.

Undertaker vs Randy Orton: Armageddon - December 18th 2005

I loved this feud, but I felt a bit let down by this match as it really wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I hope that knowing how readily willing Randy is to take a beating these days and put his body on the line, we will see him return to a HIAC against someone like Shane McMahon or even HHH.

D-X vs Shane & Vince McMahon and the Big Show: Unforgiven - September 17th 2006

This was a really surprisingly good match and the McMahons took one hell of a beating at the hands of D-X. The ending was spectacularly amusing and a bit disgusting.

Undertaker vs Batista: Survivor Series - November 18th 2007

I don't like Batista and I didn't enjoy this match as much as I thought I would as I've always held the idea that Undertaker can make anyone look good. Apparently Batista can't be made to look good even by the best there is.

3071332,5,B00120LPQK,"I thought this DVD was fantastic.  While mostly a fan of Mick Foley's work in the demonic structure called ""Hell in a Cell"", I was pleased to see some great matches outside of Foley's work.  Lesnar/Undertaker was sadistic, while the Hunter/Micheals match was a bit melodramatic, but still an outstanding story in the Cell.

This is a must for fans of the Undertaker, who is a fixture in this hellish match, as well as Triple H, whose match with Foley is included in the first disc.

Chains, chairs, barbed wire 2/4's (set aflame), sledgehammers, steel stairs, tables, death defying falls, this has it all.

For fans of sadistic displays of violence and blood like only professional wrestling can deliver, this is the DVD for you.",1232582400,,729,4.8
3071333,5,B00120LPQK,"Well there is not much to say about this release, but it is a great collection of pretty much every Hell in the Cell ever minus Taker vs Bossman from Wm15(prob because it was the worst or because Bossman got hanged in the match and with the whole Benoit thing they didn't want to include it) and the last one they did with Edge and Taker.  So if you like wrestling or you know someone who does get this dvd you won't be disappointed.",1232236800,,433,4.154761904761905
3071334,4,B00120LPQK,"This is a great set for fans of Attitude era FEDERATION fans. That was when the best of these matches occurred. Anyway, this set is missing one match (UNDERTAKER vs BOSSMAN) but everyone knows that.

Now for the part that is annoying, at first.

They have to blur out the classic attitude era scratch logo everywhere it appears on the screen and it can be distracting at first. They also have to blur out any visual WWF's and have to censor any verbal form of the abbreviation. It's still unclear to me why they aren't allowed to use the scratch logo anymore if they can use the classic one. I am aware of the lawsuit, but it still doesn't make sense why they have to blur it out.

Aside from that this DVD set is really good. I even enjoyed the WWE era matches (I stopped watching wrestling shortly after the name change).

I recommend this disc set to anyone who loves those brutal wrestling bouts.",1231286400,,900,4.403614457831325

3071336,5,B00120LPQK,I started watching WWE during the Attitude Era.  Hell in a Cell was one of the creations of that era. It's great seeing all of the these classic matches. All of them are great. Even the ones from the current era. It brings back some great memories. A must have for fans.,1228176000,,270,4.1923076923076925
3071337,5,B00120LPQK,"Brutal. Unforgiving. Satanic. Hell on Earth. These terms have been used to describe a structure, over 2 Tons of Steel, 16 Feet (now 35 feet) high(!) which has inspired terror and revulsion in many a WWE Superstar. Only 17 of these modified cage matches have taken place since 1997, and with good reason. This type of match ends or shortens careers. Ask Superstars such as Mick Foley (as Cactus Jack and Mankind), The Undertaker, Triple H (who is nearly undefeated in HIAC), Shawn Michaels, Vince and Shane McMahon, The Big Show, Brock Lesnar, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, Batista, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, The Rock, Rikishi, Randy Orton, Edge, Kane and several others. They have all been featured in this Hellish structure, and this three-disc DVD set highlights some of the most brutal ones to take place. Blood, broken bones and brutality, the three B's are the order of the day in the Devil's Playground. I would give this set a definite 5 out of 5 stars. A really excellent and action-packed DVD set. Get this one!!!",1225584000,,1030,4.792134831460674
3071338,4,B00120LPQK,"WWE's HELL IN A CELL three-disc boxed set collects (Almost....) every ""Hell In A Cell"" match since the first one way back in 1997. Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker set the bar high, with insane risks and gruesome violence, but the bar would soon be raised by Mick Foley (A.K.A. Mankind, Cactus Jack, & Dude Love), who took-risk-taking to a whole new level, with falls off of and through the Cell, chairs, thumbtacks, & flaming-barbed-wire-wrapped-two x 4's. That's part of the problem with this collection: After Foley's four deranged Cell matches, the rest, no matter how good, pale in comparison. That's one of a few small complaints I had with the set.......The others were the missing HELL IN A CELL match (The only missing one, if I'm remembering correctly....) featuring The Undertaker vs. The Big Boss Man, which is really no big loss, since I remember it being a dreadful match, but it'd be nice if it were included, if only for the sake of completeness. The last minor quibble is the lack of extras or commentaries.....It would have been great to have match-specific commentaries by some of the Superstars. But as it stands, HELL IN A CELL is a great set, running 9 hours over three discs, featuring 14 long matches, each introduced by the legendary Mick Foley himself. For old-school WWF (Yeah, I said it!!!!) fans looking to revisit the glory days, you really can't go wrong.",1225497600,,1387,4.807531380753138
3071339,5,B00120LPQK,"Although all these matches are on DVD, it's nice to have a proper set narrated by none other than Mick Foley!  There are a few matches not on this set like Kennel in a Cell and the Wrestlemania match between Boss Man and 'Taker.  Other than that, very nice layout.  Again, Mick Foley providing insight into the psyche of these matches and their effect on the wrestling world.  All in all, this is a very good addition to my WWE collection and I can't wait for other specialty matches on DVD.

3305781,5,B00120LPQK,"Hell in a Cell has been called the most dangerous match in the WWE since its debut in 1997. The cell has definitely shorten and ended not only susperstars's careers but also referees and managers. This 3 disc set shows you the best remembered Hell in the Cell Matches over the past 10 years of it's exsistence. If you have seen the Ladder Match DVD set then you will really love this set as well. This set is just as good as the Ladder Match 3 disc set is.

Mick Foley hosts the presentation and he starts off the program by giving a brief back story on why and how the Hell in a Cell Match came to be. The Hell In A Cell Matches that are not included in this set are Undertaker Vs. Big Bossman from Wrestlemania XV, Kennel in a Cell Match: Al Snow Vs. Big Bossman from Unforgiven 1999, & Undertaker Vs. Edge from SummerSlam 2008.

Bad Blood (October 5, 1997)
Undertaker Vs. European Champion Shawn Michaels - In the HIAC's debut match, Michaels and Undertaker sets the bar for future HIAC matches to come. Undertaker just really dominates HBK for mostly all the match. Once the two made their way out of the cell, Undertaker and Michaels would just fight each other around and on top of the cell. Michaels soon falls from the side of the cage & through the announce table after trying to escape from the Underaker. After Kane makes his debut and Tombstones the Undertaker, HBK becomes victorious in the first Hell In A Cell Match. This match is something to see if already haven't. 5/5

Raw (June 15, 1998)
Kane & Mankind w/ Paul Bearer Vs. WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker - This was more of a segment than anything else. Stone Cold leads Mankind and Kane outside the cell to leave the Undertaker and Paul Bearer all alone inside the locked structure. Inside the locked structure, Undertaker just beats the holy hell out of a bloody Paul Bearer while leaving Stone Cold fighting Kane and Mankind on the outside. Kane trys to climb the cell to get in before Austin meets him up there. They do not show us the after math once Raw went off the air and it aint really worth rating.

King Of The Ring (June 28, 1998)
Undertaker Vs. Mankind - This is probably the most known and memorable Hell in a Cell match of all-time and mainly because of Mankind being thrown off the cell. After being chokeslammed and thrown off the cell, Mankind and Undertaker delivers a pretty brutal match. Thumb tacks, steel steps, and chairs all gets involved. After being chokslammed onto thumb tacks, Undertaker Tombstones Mankind to pick up his first ever Hell In A Cell victory. Foley certainly gets a well deserved standing ovation after the match. 5/5

Raw (August 24, 1998)
Mankind Vs. Kane - Just like the match from King Of The Ring, Kane and Mankind starts this match off on the outside where Foley gets beaten up by both Kane and the Undertaker and also falls from the cell through the announce table. Kane and Mankind both takes some hard chair shots to the head. Thumb tacks also gets brought into this match. After Stone Cold Steve Austin interferes from under the ring, the match gets stopped. A match that's worth a watch. 4/5

No Way Out (February 27, 2000)
WWE Champion Triple H Vs. Cactus Jack - Not only was this match for HHH's WWE Title but Mick Foley's career was also in jeopardy if Mick Foley lost this match. The match itself was just as brutal and punishable as Foley's & HHH's Street Fight was from the Royal Rumble a month earlier. After Foley and the Game got out of the cell, the match would only get more violent around and on top of the cell. After once again falling from the cell and through the announce table, Foley brings out his famous barbed wire 2x4 and sets it on fire. After setting the 2x4 on fire, Foley gets backdropped through the cell and crashes through the ring followed by a Pedigree from HHH. Just like from the KOTR, Mick Foley gets a well deserved ovation after the match. And for the trivia buffs out there this is the first Hell in a Cell match where a WWE Title was defended in. 5/5

Armageddon (December 20, 2000)
Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle Vs. Triple H Vs. The Rock Vs. Rikishi Vs. The Undertaker - This has to be the wildest, craziest, & most action packed HIAC match of all time. There is action everywhere in this match. McMahon comes out and frees everybody from the cell and then all hell breaks loose everywhere. We even see a Wrestlemania X-Seven preview from Austin and the Rock. This was just a huge and tremendous match. Awesome Hell in a Cell match. 5/5

Judgment Day (May 19, 2002)
Triple H Vs. Chris Jericho - HHH and Jericho by far made up for their lousy match they had at Wrestlemania X8. Jericho takes one of the most brutal beatings ever inside a Hell in the Cell Match. Jericho tried to be tough but I think the cell got to him in this match. A ladder gets briefly used along with a steel chair, ring steps, & a sledgehammer. After being let loose, Triple H & Jericho battles all around the cell and soon make their way on top where HHH brings up with him a barbed wire 2x4. The match ends on top of the cell after Jericho gets Pedigreed by HHH. Watch out for Tim White getting up close and personal to the cell. 4.5/5

No Mercy (October 20, 2002)
WWE Champion Brock Lesnar Vs. Undertaker - Get ready to see a bloodbath because that is exactly what this HIAC Match is. Undertaker & Brock Lesnar shows everybody how violent & sedistic a Hell in the Cell Match can be. Just as brutal and sedistic fighting only inside the cell and not out. Undertaker bleed buckets in this match. Lesnar & Undertaker both uses the cell and other things around them very effectively on each other. Possibably the best Hell In A Cell Match in history. 5/5

Bad Blood (June 15, 2003)
Kevin Nash Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Triple H - Kevin Nash wasn't really getting over with the fans as WWE thought he would so they brought in Mick Foley to be the Special Guest Referee for this HIAC match. This isn't as bad as people say it is. I felt this HIAC is very violent and brutal. All men bleeds in this one including Foley. Not the best Hell in a Cell Match but definitely not the worst. 4/5

Bad Blood (June 13, 2004)
Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels - You better get ready to take a deep seat because Michaels and HHH tears each other to shreds for nearly one hour in the sedistic Hell In a Cell. HBK and HHH both takes a lot of punishment and a bloody beating from each other. This was a fantastic way to end this feud. Arguably the best Hell in a Cell match ever. This match was just off the charts. 5/5

Vengeance (June 26, 2005)
World Heavyweight Champion Batista Vs. Triple H - HHH and Batista told anincredible story here in this HIAC match. HHH is a guy that brings out the best in Batista and HHH did an fantastic job here in doing so. Everything you expect in a Hell in the Cell match and more takes place. Batista gets very physical in this match. He uses everything HHH brings out against him and more. This is a sedistic match where HHH has to take time off from afterwards. This HIAC match could also be the best ever. 5/5

Armageddon (December 18, 2005)
Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - Other reviewers point out that this HIAC match resembles more of a No Holds Barred than a true Hell in the Cell Match but I disagree with that. Undertaker and Orton provided the fans a sedistic and a very harsh match to watch. A lot of physicality is apart of this HIAC match. Orton pulls off some impressive counters to the Undertaker. Orton also takes one of the most vicious beatings from the Deadman along with two of the most hardest steel chair shots I have ever seen. A table gets introduced as well and so does some steel steps in this match. The interference from Bob Orton wasn't really needed but I felt this Hell in a Cell match was great. Another big time HIAC match. 5/5

Unforgiven (September 17, 2006)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince, Shane McMahon, & ECW Champion Big Show - A new Hell In A Cell structure was introduced for this match. Great usage with the cell and the weapons that were used such as a sledgehammer & steel chairs are used very effectively in this HIAC match. It has a vicious and sickening ending with HHH breaking a sledgehammer on the back on Mr. McMahon. This is another hellacious match. 5/5

Survivor Series (November 18, 2007)
Undertaker Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Batista - The new amplified version of the Hell In A Cell continued here as the Undertaker & Batista ended their nealry year long feud. Undertaker is another guy that brings out the best in Batista and this was a tremendous match. Not a whole lot of weapons used but the ones that were, Undertaker & Batista uses them very effectively. They could have used the cell more but it was still good. The ending and the post-match beat down from Edge is something to check out and it really added more to the match. 5/5

Hell In A Cell is called the Devil's Structure and every match from this set displays why. This is an awesome set to add to your collection and is HIGHLY recommended.",1224028800,43,9062,4.397971360381861
3305782,5,B00120LPQK,"Just like Shawn helped make the ladder match a gimmick staple of WWE, he did the same when it came time to have a cage match with Undertaker during their classic 1997 feud when he suggested to Vince to have a cage match with a roof on it. Shawn had remembered a match from the NWA that featured a cage with a roof on it, thus his suggestion became ""Hell in a Cell"".

I won't list the matches, there are enough reviews like that already. Instead, I want to review the actual product. First, the 3-disc collector's package is arguably the best designed packaging WWE has ever released. It's full of stunning high-resolution images that get pretty graphic. When you open the set, you're greeted by 2 gory full panel photos of Triple H and Batista respectively from their battles within the HIAC.
The DVD is hosted by the now departed Mick Foley (he's now on the mess of a promotion called TNA) who does an excellent job introducing the matches and giving informative analysis of HIAC's most memorable moments. On a side note, it's a real shame that the way Vince would rattle Mick in his Smackdown headset during tv tapings lead to his departure from the promotion he played a major part in helping to make Vince the undisputed top promotion in the US during the Monday night wars. Here's hoping Mick will get to come back and get the respect he deserves.
Each match also includes a video package recapping the events leading up to the match. I love this, because these packages bring back a lot of memories for me personally and give the context needed for new viewers to understand the reason why these matches were booked in the first place.
As for the matches, I can't imagine anyone having anything to complain about here. This is the best of the best. Most of these matches I already have on other DVDs, but decided to buy this for 4 rare HIAC matches, 3 of which are making their DVD debut. You get two HIAC matches from Monday Night RAW that most fans may have forgotten about. One is pretty much just an angle and not a real match ( Stone Cold Steve Austin and Undertaker vs. Mankind and Kane ), but the second, Mankind vs. Kane, is actually pretty good. Some people may find it odd that RAW aired these matches, instead of saving them for PPV, but they took place at the height of the Monday night war when ratings were king and hot-shot booking was common for both WWF and WCW. During his match with Kane, Mick takes some sick bumps on free tv. I'm talking about the kind of bumps that make you shake your head in their excess and risk. Although nothing like his infamous HIAC match with Undertaker, Mick's HIAC with Kane is worth seeking out. Another rare match, making it's DVD debut, is the six-man battle inside HIAC from Armageddon 2000. At the time, the match didn't get over very well because people didn't think it's stunt bumps measured up to previous HIAC matches, but now that WWE has conditioned fans not to expect cage dives in HIAC anymore, the match can be enjoyed for what it was, an all-out action packed match from bell-to-bell. Kurt Angle, The Rock, Triple H, Steve Austin, Undertaker and Rikishi (of all people) put on one hell of a match. Austin and Rock in particular get to shine in this one. Finally, the last rare match worth seeking this DVD set out for, is the hard to get Triple H vs. Chris Jericho HIAC match from Judgement Day 2002. The Judgement Day 2002 DVD was quickly pulled after it's release I think because of legal issues over the use of the old WWF scratch logo which partly appears in the event, even though the company had already changed their name to WWE by the time this event aired on PPV. The DVD was later briefly released by a Canadian distributor called Koch and copies of this event were selling for outrageous prices both here and on rival auction sites. So, finally this great match from that event is available on DVD again for a reasonable price. This match marks the end of Tim White's ref career, when he took two hard bumps and was never physically able to referee again. Both Triple H and Jericho give it their all and it marks the first time a HIAC match ended with the decision taking place on top of the cell!
As for the rest of the matches, if you haven't seen them they're worth going out of your way to see. I was glad to see my favorite HIAC match included here, which is Brock Lesnar vs Undertaker. In my opinion, no other HIAC has been able to top this one for both it's storytelling and athleticism. The action is brutal, stiff and believable. Taker also does one of the sickest blade jobs I've ever seen in WWE during this match, surpassed only by Eddie Guerrero's graphic blade job where he bled buckets during his title match with JBL from Judgement Day 2004. Both Lesnar and Taker deliver a classic match here that if you've never seen it, is guaranteed to blow you away.

So, if you're a long time fan like myself, and have seen most of these matches or own them on other DVDs, you may want to skip this release, but I think it's worth picking up for the rare RAW HIAC matches and the six-man match from Armageddon, all making their DVD debut here. If you're a recent fan and new to wrestling, then this is a must buy that will leave you speechless numerous times, by the sheer brutality that the HIAC matches are famous for.",1223942400,,5306,4.429887410440123

3305786,5,B00120LPQK,"This match has shorted careers & eventually ended them for not just wrestlers but anyone around including referees. Relive the memories of the infamous Hell In The Cell match on DVD.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Due to how out of hand their previous match got, Undertaker once again made history by being the first participant in a new innovative match...Hell In A Cell. This set the standard for future Cell matches & for being the first one, this was really something to watch. They dished out heavy punishment like never before & used everything they could get their hands on such as the steel steps & chairs to the point where Shawn was bleeding so much that his face would be what Gordon Solie called a ""crimson mask."" Shawn's fall towards the end would later be heavily overshadowed by Mankind's fall less than a year later but still one of the biggest highlights in Cell history along with the debut of Undertaker's brother, Kane. This was something to see for that time...and still is something to see to this day.
In Your House: Bad Blood 97
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Kane & Mankind - This was more of a segment than an actual match as Austin brawled on the outside of the Cell with Mankind & on the top with Kane while Undertaker took his liberties with Paul Bearer locked inside the cell.
""RAW"" June 98
[Best Of RAW: Vol. 1 & 2]

Undertaker vs. Mankind - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.
King Of The Ring 98
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Best Of King Of The Ring; OMG: Top 50 Moments]

Mankind vs. Kane - This is the most unusual setting for this type of match as Kane & Mankind were the Tag Team Champions at this time but earlier in the night, Kane revealed his alliance with Undertaker & turned on Mankind in the process.  Mankind tried to climb to the top of the cell right from the start & throwing chairs onto the top of the cage (with some missing & landing on J.R. & King at the announce table in the process) but referees kept stopping him based off what happened last time before Mankind still tried to climb only to Taker to pull him down through the spanish table.  When Mankind finally got back in the match, it was all about him taking punishment as his head was heavily attacked from it being slammed in the door to various chairshots & even taking a tombstone on the chair.  However in the end, it was all about a promise made earlier in the night being fulfilled.
""RAW"" Aug 98

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match.  Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen.  Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process.  Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board.  From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall.  This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who take take the punishment as well as dish it.

[Triple H: King Of Kings]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H vs. Rikishi - This was the first (and to date, only) time that we had a multiple men competing in a cell match with Kurt Angle making himself the odd man out by attacking everyone at some point in the week leading up to this match.  This match was exactly what you expected with all of these men here in that it was absolutely all over the place with all four of these men but things got even crazier with Mr. McMahon (who didn't want this match to happen) coming to ringside with a truck attempting to take down the cell piece by piece but only got as far as ripping the door off the cell.  Other various highlights & moments happened throughout the match like Triple H's head bring grinded across the all four sides of the cell causing him to bleed, everyone escaping the cell & brawling all over the set with Triple H having ""the boom"" dropped on him & catapulted onto a car while Austin went headfirst through the a window, Taker & Angle brawling at ringside with the ringbell hammer being used, and fighting on top of the cell with someone getting a stunner while someone else took the fall off the cage, and action in the ring that really picked up when Rock & Austin locked eyes in the ring.  This can be perfectly summed up with Lawler's comment at the end, ""Look at all this carnage!""
Armageddon 00
[The Attitude Era]

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Almost a year later after Triple H injured his quad in a match against Jericho, they meet here in Jericho's first cell match.  They started off wrestling against each other before Jericho got more aggressive using the steps to catapult Triple H into the cell while also using the cell & ramming a ladder into Triple H's face in & out of the ring to bust him open.  Triple H was finally able to fight fire with fire as he used weapons like a chair, the steps, and his own sledgehammer against Jericho resulting in Jericho bleeding.  The match started to get so brutal that nobody was safe as referee Tim White was knocked off the apron into the cell at one point before bring thrown into the cell again, assaulted, and bleeding thanks to Jericho to the point where he was heavily injured & didn't referee another match for close to two years later.  Both men eventually made their way outside of the cell with both the cage door & even a table coming into play before the match got taken to & finished at the top of the cell complete with a barbed wire bat that ended up getting stick to one of the heads.  While Triple H & Jericho have had various encounters over the years, this one is definitely one of their best.
Judgment Day 02

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker - Undertaker came into this match with a cast on his hand & wrist due to an injury Brock caused weeks earlier by Brock & used it as a weapon right away against Lesnar to the point that Lesnar was bleeding but Taker also hurt himself in the process. Taker used whatever he could get his hands on against Brock such as being thrown into it various times while his face was grinding against it along with throwing Brock against the steel steps while Heyman tried to get involved on the outside only for him to pay the price to the point where he was busted open as well. Brock came back in a vicious manner using the ringpost & cell to ram Taker before busting him open while also using a chair to eventually break the cast over which effected Taker as we saw later when he tried to lift the steel steps. Both men kept trading momentum beating each other into exhaustion while still being able to counter each others signature moves throughout the match as this overall was a physical war to say the least to the point where everyone involved (including Heyman on the outside of cell) paying the price.
No Mercy 02
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Due to the out of control nature of their previous match, they met in the cell here & due to the career ending injury that referee Tim White had in the previous cell match, Mick Foley returned to the WWE to referee this match.  Nash was dominate here focusing on Triple H's back ramming it into the cell & using a chair before Triple H gained some momentum using his sledgehammer on Nash's knee & head making him bleed before Foley had to forcefully take it away from him.  Triple H continued to dish out the punishment on Nash's head using whatever he could get his hands on from the cell to the steps, a screwdriver, and barbed-wire bat before Nash would later get his receipt using the weapons as well before Triple H continued to use more weapons including a wooden crate & a chair.  This was one of those matches where the environment of the cell made this match way better than it ever could be on it's own as it's no secret how Nash has a limited moveset while was heavily injury prove during this time of his career and the element of Foley being the referee & getting involved at times only added here in a positive way.
Bad Blood 03

Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Triple H heavily focused on Shawn's previously injured back in the early stages with hard whips into the turnbuckle & elbow drops & stomps & British Bulldog's delayed vertical suplex while later also using the environment around him such as a side slam on the chair & backbreaker on an open chair while one moment he rammed Shawn's back into the post & cell & apron back to back.  Triple H continued to punish Shawn causing him to bleed before Shawn got his reciept using  chairshots to bust open Triple H while bring in a ladder & table to beat & inflict punishment like his elbow drop off the ladder onto Triple H on a table.  This was the most unique performance in this type of match as it wasn't one that heavily played on hardcore violence or ""Oh My God!"" moments more than it was just about two men beating each other in physical exhaustion for over 45 minutes.
Bad Blood 04

World Champion Batista vs. Triple H - Their third & final encounter for the World Championship with Batista being in control early before hurting his shoulder hitting the post with Batista being knocked off the apron into the cell shoulder first.  A biker chain came into play with both men on the end of being whipped & choked with it before Batista got real aggressive delivering a spinebuster between the cell & post busting Triple H open as well.  Another weapon was brought into the match in the form of as steel chair wrapped in barbed-wire causing both men to bleed from various parts of the body like the back & face from moves like chairshots, face grinds, powerslam onto it, and even a DDT.  Triple H's sledgehammer was brought into play with both men using it to their advantage while the steel steps were also used to punish.  This was definitely a brutal battle as both men not only dished out physical punishment but also used the various weapons to not only inflict more punishment but tell a story as well.
Vengeance 05
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - After trying to end the WrestleMania streak & involving his father & trying to end Taker's career twice including burning his casket, it all ends here inside Hell In A Cell.  Taker dominated from the start punishing Orton's head & face via chairshots that busted him open, ramming it into the cell, and using the steel steps.  Orton had to resort to an RKO out of nowhere to finally get the advantage & used the steps himself to have Taker bleeding while also using other weapons like a chair & the chair.  Both men traded momentum including Taker using the cell to perform his version of ""Old School"" & even attacking Bob Orton through the cell while Orton was able to use a table & even counter Taker's tombstone into his own.  This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match as it wasn't as brutal, high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.
Armageddon 05
[Undertaker's Deadliest Matches]

D-Generation X vs. Big Show, Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon - This was the first (and to date only) handicap match in this environment while also the debut of the newer & larger Hell In A Cell.  DX was able to keep ""neutralizing"" Big Show in the beginning in order to focus on the McMahons using anything they could get their hands on from the cell itself, which busted them open, to even a screwdriver.  Show was able to help the McMahons get their advantage as they were able to make DX bleed while focusing on Triple H's previously injured ear with moves like the coast to coast with a trash can.  Vince made it clear that he was out to punish DX more than win the match which would only come back to haunt them as Shane would end up having his neck damaged to the point where he was showing internal bleeding, Show being knocked out, and Vince getting a ""taste"" of his own medicine.
Unforgiven 06
[New & Improved D-Generation X]

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker - After each man winning one match in their series while also going to two draws, this is set to be the encounter to determine who's the better man.  Both men started off with impactful moves right out the cage trading clotheslines while Batista executed the spear & Taker with his big boot.  Taker then went on the attack with a chair causing Batista to bleed from the mouth before he recovered with a running powerslam.  They traded momentum with Taker being tossed into the cell followed by a clothesline while Batista was thrown into the steps, the cell & busted open with a chair before Batista made Taker bleed ramming his head into the steps repeatedly.  Both men went back & forth with counters & reversals from the superplex into the triangle choke, the Batista Bomb into a backdrop on the steps, another Batista Bomb through a table, Tombstone on the steel steps, and both men continuing to kick out of each others signature holds.  In the end however, it was the one ""wild card"" in regards to both men & the World Championship that would be the difference maker.  Just like their entire series of matches, this was an awesome encounter.
Survivor Series 07

The only match they left out was the Undertaker/Big Boss Man one from WrestleMania XV but you really aren't missing anything there as that has gone down as the worst one of them all the point where they never showed highlights of that match when doing the video features on the Hell In A Cell Match.  So out of 14 Hell In The Cell matches on here, only 2 of them are ones that would be considered flops & this would be considered an ultimate collection for those who are fans of this match & love violence & brutality. This is one collection I would highly recommend.",1200873600,27,15636,4.416058394160584

3305813,5,B00120LPQK,"Of all the gimmick matches that are in WWE, Hell in a Cell has to be my favorite one. It is a match that never fails to impress me. Nearly all the matches are brutal as they are incredible. This DVD sets lives up to every expectations I had for it. It has almost all the HIAC matches (well not Taker vs. Boss Man) up to 2007. Hardcore Legend Mick Foley hosts this set along with the promos for the feuds for each match.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels- Bad Blood 1997
This was the very first HITC ever. It is a very fast paced match that sets the bar for future HITC matches. Both Taker & HBK take a ton of bumps in this match. A funny bit in this match includes HBK attacking a camera man so the refs can unlock the door so HBK can escape which leads to both men fighting on top of the Cell. Taker gives HBK a big beating in the final moments of the match with some of the hardest chairshot shots ever. Kane makes his WWE debut by breaking down the door and giving Taker a tombstone to cost him his match. This was a fantastic match. It was truly a defining moment for both men.

Kane & Mankind w/ Paul Bearer vs. WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker- RAW IS WAR 1998
As one reviewer has stated already, this was more of a segment than an actual match. But it's still very entertaining nonetheless. Kane & Mankind go outside the Cell to attack Austin. Paul Bearer locks himself in the Cell to protect himself. Boy was he wrong because Undertaker was under the ring waiting for that. Paul Bearer gets a big beat down while Kane tries to find a way in. It's just a fun moment to the DVD.

Undertaker vs. Mankind- King of the Ring 1998
I don't think this match needs any intro. If there is any word to define this match, it's LEGENDARY! It was an intense & brutal match. Mick Foley takes what might be his worst beating in his career! Falling off the 16 feet high Cell is a sight to see. But that doesn't stop him from coming back, only to get chokeslamed THROUGH the cell. But EVEN THAT DOESN'T STOP HIM! Both men truly put on a Hell (no pun intended) of a match. It ends with a crazy thumbtack spot. This match proves two important things. One is that Mick Foley has one of the bravest hearts out of many wrestlers. The other is that Undertaker is the ultimate badass in WWE history!!! A must see match for anyone.

Mankind vs. Kane- RAW IS WAR 1998
A forgotten HITC. This was a fun match, but nowhere near as good as the others. Mankind tries to climb the Cell AGAIN before Undertaker pulls him down which results in Mankind landing on the tables and hitting his head on the floor which looked like it hurt. Both Kane & Mankind pull off a good main event on RAW. The thumbtacks appear again, this time Kane lands on them with his butt. Stone Cold Steve Austin appears in this match and gives Kane a beat down. This was a short but sweet match.

WWE Champion Triple H Vs. Cactus Jack- No Way out 2000
This was not only Triple H's first HITC match, but also the first time the title was on the line in HITC. Both men give us a great main event. A 2x4 wrapped in barbwire makes an appearance and is later set on fire. It is also the first time both wrestlers left the cell through a broken cell wall of instead of the door. There is a nice table spot and Foley falls through the cell again. This time with a more safer landing. It seemed to catch Triple H by surprise too, look at his reacting afterward. This match is what Foley considered his swan song of a match and he got a good send off by the fans. A great match worth seeing.

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Undertaker vs. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H vs. Rikshi- Armageddon 2000
This was the first time ever that Hell in a Cell had not two, but six men fighting each other. It was a truly fantastic match for the attitude era because it has six of the best wrestlers ever in that era. This is one of my all time favorites. It was a wild and crazy match with everyone out to get one another. Some of my favorite parts go from everyone using their famous finishers on each other in 5 minutes, Vinny Mac trying to tear the Cell down, to Undertaker chokeslaming Rikishi off the cell. It's an epic match that never gets boring. A must see!

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho- Judgment Day 2002
The Hell in the Cell had been gone for almost a year, so it was about time for it to make a come back. What better way to bring it back by putting it in the feud between HHH & Y2J. Both men put on a great bout and remains to be one of their best.  A ladder & steel steps come into play. Y2J bumps into ref Tim White and beats the shit out of him. It's a crazy moment with Y2J yelling ""You SOB! You cost me the match!!"" to him. Both Triple H & Y2J go up to the top of the cell where they finish the fight. This makes it the only time where the pin fall happens on top of the Cell.

Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar- No Mercy 2002
This was a very bloody bout. Both men bleed, but Taker gets the worst of it. Heck, even Paul Heyman bleeds. The Cell is used a lot in this match.  But this is the first time neither of them go outside of the Cell to fight on top of it. The whole match takes place inside and it's still fantastic. But Paul Heyman's yelling could get annoying after a while. The ending was great and it was fitting to this match.

Triple H vs. Kevin Nash w/ Mick Foley as the referee- Bad Blood 2003
Many people hated this match for some reason. I thought it was a great match. Both men beat the crap out of each other.  Mick Foley adds more to this match as he's always ready to count the pin fall on Triple H. All three men bleed in this match and its ending was unpredictable.  Not the very best cell match, but still a great match nonetheless.

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels- Bad Blood 2004
This has to be the longest Hell in the Cell match ever, because this two beat the hell out of each other for an hour. This was truly one of their best bouts behind their last man standing match at Royal Rumble 04. A ladder gets used in this match and as does the Cell. The ending was truly emotional and it was a great way to end their feud. Check it out.

World Champion Batista vs. Triple H- Vengeance 2005
This was the final encounter of this men starting from Wrestlemania 21. It was a brutal match for the World Heavyweight Title. Both men bring a ton of weapons here and both bleed a lot. This match was made to truly put Batista over and it did it well. The ending was epic as Triple H attempts to hit Batista with the sledgehammer as he's being power bombed. Great match!

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton- Armageddon 2005
After being attacked for the whole year by Orton, Taker had enough as decided to finish at in the match he made famous. This might be their best match together as it was brutal and fast paced. Randy Orton takes some very nasty chair shots by Taker and a table comes into play. It had a ton of reversals like Orton giving Taker a tombstone.  This match also had the door open since Triple H vs. YJ2 in 2002. Randy's father gets involved only to get beaten down by Undertaker.  The ending is also an epic way to end their long ""Legend vs. Legend Killer"" feud that started at Wrestlemania 21. Don't pass this up, it's a great match.

DX (Triple H & Shawn Michaels) vs. Big Show and the McMahons (Vince & Shane) - Unforgiven 2006
This match famously introduced the new 20 feet tall Cell which is still being used today.  This has to be the best of DX's matches together since they returned together. This bout was brutal as Vince, Shane & Big Show dominated DX for a good portion before they came back. The ending to this match was funny as DX shoves Vince's face up Big Show butt. I'm serious!!  This was a great bout and a good way to end the feud between Vince & DX.

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker- Survivor Series 2007
Anytime these two men were paired together, it turns to gold. This was a great way to end their year long feud. Both men really beat the crap out of each other and they were always on the same page. There were many close calls and it was an unpredictable bout.  Edge makes an appearance which adds to the match but might disappoint some because it didn't end clean. But this was still a great match between these two forces of destruction and it might be their best match.

I feel like this DVD should have included Undertaker vs. Edge at Summerslam 2008. That was also a damn good match and would have been a great way to finish this DVD. But you can get that in Undertaker's Deadliest Matches DVD, so it's ok. I also wish there was more special features like in ring segments that involved the Cell.  Mick Foley's comments on each match are fantastic and he seemed like he had fun with it. This is a must buy DVD from WWE and Hell in a Cell is one of the best. Don't pass it up, get ASAP!!!!",1346025600,4,8813,4.151817116060961
3305814,5,B00120LPQK,"This match has shorted careers & eventually ended them for not just wrestlers but anyone around including referees. Relive the memories of the infamous Hell In The Cell match on DVD.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Due to how out of hand their previous match got, Undertaker once again made history by being the first participant in a new innovative match...Hell In A Cell. This set the standard for future Cell matches & for being the first one, this was really something to watch. They dished out heavy punishment like never before & used everything they could get their hands on such as the steel steps & chairs to the point where Shawn was bleeding so much that his face would be what Gordon Solie called a ""crimson mask."" Shawn's fall towards the end would later be heavily overshadowed by Mankind's fall less than a year later but still one of the biggest highlights in Cell history along with the debut of Undertaker's brother, Kane. This was something to see for that time...and still is something to see to this day.
In Your House: Bad Blood 97
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Kane & Mankind - This was more of a segment than an actual match as Austin brawled on the outside of the Cell with Mankind & on the top with Kane while Undertaker took his liberties with Paul Bearer locked inside the cell.
""RAW"" June 98
[Best Of RAW: Vol. 1 & 2]

Undertaker vs. Mankind - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.
King Of The Ring 98
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Best Of King Of The Ring; OMG: Top 50 Moments]

Mankind vs. Kane - This is the most unusual setting for this type of match as Kane & Mankind were the Tag Team Champions at this time but earlier in the night, Kane revealed his alliance with Undertaker & turned on Mankind in the process.  Mankind tried to climb to the top of the cell right from the start & throwing chairs onto the top of the cage (with some missing & landing on J.R. & King at the announce table in the process) but referees kept stopping him based off what happened last time before Mankind still tried to climb only to Taker to pull him down through the spanish table.  When Mankind finally got back in the match, it was all about him taking punishment as his head was heavily attacked from it being slammed in the door to various chairshots & even taking a tombstone on the chair.  However in the end, it was all about a promise made earlier in the night being fulfilled.
""RAW"" Aug 98

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match.  Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen.  Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process.  Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board.  From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall.  This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who take take the punishment as well as dish it.
No Way Out 00
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H vs. Rikishi - This was the first (and to date, only) time that we had a multiple men competing in a cell match with Kurt Angle making himself the odd man out by attacking everyone at some point in the week leading up to this match.  This match was exactly what you expected with all of these men here in that it was absolutely all over the place with all four of these men but things got even crazier with Mr. McMahon (who didn't want this match to happen) coming to ringside with a truck attempting to take down the cell piece by piece but only got as far as ripping the door off the cell.  Other various highlights & moments happened throughout the match like Triple H's head bring grinded across the all four sides of the cell causing him to bleed, everyone escaping the cell & brawling all over the set with Triple H having ""the boom"" dropped on him & catapulted onto a car while Austin went headfirst through the a window, Taker & Angle brawling at ringside with the ringbell hammer being used, and fighting on top of the cell with someone getting a stunner while someone else took the fall off the cage, and action in the ring that really picked up when Rock & Austin locked eyes in the ring.  This can be perfectly summed up with Lawler's comment at the end, ""Look at all this carnage!""
Armageddon 00
[The Attitude Era]

Triple H vs. Chris Jericho - Almost a year later after Triple H injured his quad in a match against Jericho, they meet here in Jericho's first cell match.  They started off wrestling against each other before Jericho got more aggressive using the steps to catapult Triple H into the cell while also using the cell & ramming a ladder into Triple H's face in & out of the ring to bust him open.  Triple H was finally able to fight fire with fire as he used weapons like a chair, the steps, and his own sledgehammer against Jericho resulting in Jericho bleeding.  The match started to get so brutal that nobody was safe as referee Tim White was knocked off the apron into the cell at one point before bring thrown into the cell again, assaulted, and bleeding thanks to Jericho to the point where he was heavily injured & didn't referee another match for close to two years later.  Both men eventually made their way outside of the cell with both the cage door & even a table coming into play before the match got taken to & finished at the top of the cell complete with a barbed wire bat that ended up getting stick to one of the heads.  While Triple H & Jericho have had various encounters over the years, this one is definitely one of their best.
Judgment Day 02

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker - Undertaker came into this match with a cast on his hand & wrist due to an injury Brock caused weeks earlier by Brock & used it as a weapon right away against Lesnar to the point that Lesnar was bleeding but Taker also hurt himself in the process. Taker used whatever he could get his hands on against Brock such as being thrown into it various times while his face was grinding against it along with throwing Brock against the steel steps while Heyman tried to get involved on the outside only for him to pay the price to the point where he was busted open as well. Brock came back in a vicious manner using the ringpost & cell to ram Taker before busting him open while also using a chair to eventually break the cast over which effected Taker as we saw later when he tried to lift the steel steps. Both men kept trading momentum beating each other into exhaustion while still being able to counter each others signature moves throughout the match as this overall was a physical war to say the least to the point where everyone involved (including Heyman on the outside of cell) paying the price.
No Mercy 02
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Due to the out of control nature of their previous match, they met in the cell here & due to the career ending injury that referee Tim White had in the previous cell match, Mick Foley returned to the WWE to referee this match.  Nash was dominate here focusing on Triple H's back ramming it into the cell & using a chair before Triple H gained some momentum using his sledgehammer on Nash's knee & head making him bleed before Foley had to forcefully take it away from him.  Triple H continued to dish out the punishment on Nash's head using whatever he could get his hands on from the cell to the steps, a screwdriver, and barbed-wire bat before Nash would later get his receipt using the weapons as well before Triple H continued to use more weapons including a wooden crate & a chair.  This was one of those matches where the environment of the cell made this match way better than it ever could be on it's own as it's no secret how Nash has a limited moveset while was heavily injury prove during this time of his career and the element of Foley being the referee & getting involved at times only added here in a positive way.
Bad Blood 03

Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Triple H heavily focused on Shawn's previously injured back in the early stages with hard whips into the turnbuckle & elbow drops & stomps & British Bulldog's delayed vertical suplex while later also using the environment around him such as a side slam on the chair & backbreaker on an open chair while one moment he rammed Shawn's back into the post & cell & apron back to back.  Triple H continued to punish Shawn causing him to bleed before Shawn got his reciept using  chairshots to bust open Triple H while bring in a ladder & table to beat & inflict punishment like his elbow drop off the ladder onto Triple H on a table.  This was the most unique performance in this type of match as it wasn't one that heavily played on hardcore violence or ""Oh My God!"" moments more than it was just about two men beating each other in physical exhaustion for over 45 minutes.
Bad Blood 04

World Champion Batista vs. Triple H - Their third & final encounter for the World Championship with Batista being in control early before hurting his shoulder hitting the post with Batista being knocked off the apron into the cell shoulder first.  A biker chain came into play with both men on the end of being whipped & choked with it before Batista got real aggressive delivering a spinebuster between the cell & post busting Triple H open as well.  Another weapon was brought into the match in the form of as steel chair wrapped in barbed-wire causing both men to bleed from various parts of the body like the back & face from moves like chairshots, face grinds, powerslam onto it, and even a DDT.  Triple H's sledgehammer was brought into play with both men using it to their advantage while the steel steps were also used to punish.  This was definitely a brutal battle as both men not only dished out physical punishment but also used the various weapons to not only inflict more punishment but tell a story as well.
Vengeance 05
[Triple H: King Of Kings]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - After trying to end the WrestleMania streak & involving his father & trying to end Taker's career twice including burning his casket, it all ends here inside Hell In A Cell.  Taker dominated from the start punishing Orton's head & face via chairshots that busted him open, ramming it into the cell, and using the steel steps.  Orton had to resort to an RKO out of nowhere to finally get the advantage & used the steps himself to have Taker bleeding while also using other weapons like a chair & the chair.  Both men traded momentum including Taker using the cell to perform his version of ""Old School"" & even attacking Bob Orton through the cell while Orton was able to use a table & even counter Taker's tombstone into his own.  This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match as it wasn't as brutal, high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.
Armageddon 05
[Undertaker's Deadliest Matches]

D-Generation X vs. Big Show, Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon - This was the first (and to date only) handicap match in this environment while also the debut of the newer & larger Hell In A Cell.  DX was able to keep ""neutralizing"" Big Show in the beginning in order to focus on the McMahons using anything they could get their hands on from the cell itself, which busted them open, to even a screwdriver.  Show was able to help the McMahons get their advantage as they were able to make DX bleed while focusing on Triple H's previously injured ear with moves like the coast to coast with a trash can.  Vince made it clear that he was out to punish DX more than win the match which would only come back to haunt them as Shane would end up having his neck damaged to the point where he was showing internal bleeding, Show being knocked out, and Vince getting a ""taste"" of his own medicine.
Unforgiven 06
[New & Improved D-Generation X]

World Champion Batista vs. Undertaker - After each man winning one match in their series while also going to two draws, this is set to be the encounter to determine who's the better man.  Both men started off with impactful moves right out the cage trading clotheslines while Batista executed the spear & Taker with his big boot.  Taker then went on the attack with a chair causing Batista to bleed from the mouth before he recovered with a running powerslam.  They traded momentum with Taker being tossed into the cell followed by a clothesline while Batista was thrown into the steps, the cell & busted open with a chair before Batista made Taker bleed ramming his head into the steps repeatedly.  Both men went back & forth with counters & reversals from the superplex into the triangle choke, the Batista Bomb into a backdrop on the steps, another Batista Bomb through a table, Tombstone on the steel steps, and both men continuing to kick out of each others signature holds.  In the end however, it was the one ""wild card"" in regards to both men & the World Championship that would be the difference maker.  Just like their entire series of matches, this was an awesome encounter.
Survivor Series 07

The only match they left out was the Undertaker/Big Boss Man one from WrestleMania XV but you really aren't missing anything there as that has gone down as the worst one of them all the point where they never showed highlights of that match when doing the video features on the Hell In A Cell Match.  So out of 14 Hell In The Cell matches on here, only 2 of them are ones that would be considered flops & this would be considered an ultimate collection for those who are fans of this match & love violence & brutality. This is one collection I would highly recommend.",1334880000,3,15636,4.416058394160584
3305815,3,B00120LPQK,I love the fact that it included all cell matches but 1. I would give it 5 stars but the first disc was really scratched,1324080000,,120,3.84
3305816,5,B00120LPQK,"This is quite possibly the best DVD product WWE has ever produced.  I have a collection of over 40 events and collections, and this is easily my favorite.  The 3-disc set features all of the great HIAC matches over a decade, with the exception of a few.  Mick Foley is quite possibly the only person qualified to host/present the matches. The matches on the set are:

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels (Bad Blood- 1997)
Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Mankind & Kane (Raw- June, 1998)
Undertaker vs. Mankind (King of the Ring- 1998)
Mankind vs. Kane (Raw- August, 1998)
Triple H vs. Cactus Jack (No Way Out- 2000)
Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi vs. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H (Armageddon- 2000)
Triple H vs. Chris Jericho (Judgement Day- 2002)
Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar (No Mercy- 2002)
Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (Bad Blood- 2003)
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels (Bad Blood- 2004)
Triple H vs. Batista (Vengeance- 2005)
Undertaker vs. Randy Orton (Armageddon- 2005)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels (D-Generation X) vs. Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon & Big Show (Unforgiven- 2006)
Undertaker vs. Batista (Survivor Series- 2007)

Every match in this set is brilliant, with of course a few standouts: Taker/Michaels, Taker/Mankind, HHH/Michaels.  I'm going to keep this brief and just mention that this video speaks for itself.  Relive all the great HIAC moments of the past, and save yourself from the present ""family friendly"" product, and the ridiculous HIAC gimmicked PPV.",1318809600,,1496,4.983935742971887
3305817,5,B00120LPQK,"The Hell In Cell. It's been called Satan's Structure, The Devil's Playground & The Deadman's Playground. All names appropriately describe the Cell. And this set has every IAC match that ever took place with the only 2 exceptions being Al Snow vs Bossman in the Kennel From Hell match & Taker vs Bossman at WM15. IMO, while this is a very solid set, they should have waited. I'll explain why later.

Host: Appropriately enough, Mick Foley.

Bad Blood (October 5, 1997) - Taker & HBK made history here. Taker himself said in 2003 that this is the favorite match of his career. Has that changed since then? I don't know. But this was a damn good match. This was also the debut of Kane. Worth multiple viewings.

Raw (June 15, 1998)
Kane & Mankind w/ Paul Bearer Vs. WWE Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker - This isn't a match though it was supposed to be. What ended up happening was after Paul locked himself in the casket & Taker's music played (he never came out so SC had to fend for himself), He (being Paul) stood in the ring & Taker popped from underneath & just beat the hell out of him. He even used the steps on him! Kane tried it but couldn't so he climbed to the top. SC shortly after went there & just attacked Kane.

King Of The Ring (June 28, 1998)
Undertaker Vs. Mankind - History was remade here. This is still a talked about match after 13 years. They really set a new bar here. This is worth multiple viewings as the first one is.

Raw (August 24, 1998)
Mankind Vs. Kane - I wished this had a true winner. But this was made to further Kane & Mankind's separation to further SC's storyline with Taker. SC said he'd get one of them before the night was over & he interfered, as his target was Kane, which ended the match. Taker responded to this. That should have been an extra.

No Way Out (February 27, 2000)
WWE Champion Triple H Vs. Cactus Jack - A memorable match. Foley's career was supposed to be on the line. I say that because at this time, it was. But since he competed many times following this, that stipulation doesn't mean anything. I remember this for the backdrop that sent Foley crashing through the ring. Great match.

Armageddon (December 20, 2000)
Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle Vs. Triple H Vs. The Rock Vs. Rikishi Vs. The Undertaker - This happened at a ppv that was appropriately named Armageddon because that's exactly what this was. All men bled, Rikishi went from the top of the Cell onto the back of a truck, action everywhere. What more do you want in a match?

Judgment Day (May 19, 2002)
Triple H Vs. Chris Jericho - Not my favorite match. The effort was there though. Probably didn't like this or their Wm18 bout because to me, their best matches happened in 2000.

No Mercy (October 20, 2002)
Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar - Man, Taker really & I mean LITERALLY, he REALLY SOLD here! Never have I ever seen anyone with so much blood on them. He had a broken arm, bled like crazy & still seemed like he could win yet at the same time, he managed to put Lesnar over. After the match, Lesnar stood on top of the Cell with the Title & Taker looked on & when I saw those eyes, I thought he'd retire. So glad he didn't. Not only because if he did, we wouldn't see his awesome year long feuds with Orton, Batista & Edge, but more importantly because Lesnar doesn't deserve the right to retire Taker. No one does.

Bad Blood (June 15, 2003)
Kevin Nash Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Triple H - I was excited to see Nash return. That is, till I saw this match. Their match at Judgment Day was ok as was his match. I guess since WWE felt Nash didn't get over & wasn't really the man he was when he was Diesel, they brought in the right guy to referee a HIAC match, Mick Foley. Foley made this match for me.

Bad Blood (June 13, 2004)
Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels - A great match. I still think the first 2 HIAC matches are the best even to this day. But this was very good. They really took it to each other. And I thought their Last man Standing match at the Royal Rumble couldn't be topped. Well, maybe it wasn't. And if not, this ties with that match.

Vengeance (June 26, 2005)
World Heavyweight Champion Batista Vs. Triple H - I was never a big fan of HHH after his DX days & was never a fan of Batista till his feuds with Edge & Taker. But I'll credit both men. They told a great story here. Worth a watch.

Armageddon (December 18, 2005)
Undertaker Vs. Randy Orton - Wow. I haven't seen Taker this way since the first 2 HIAC matches & I don't think I've seen him this way since this match happened. If you wanna see a sadistic, bloody HIAC match, then this is for you. Not only was the Cell used as a weapon. But a chair, a table & the Urn were also used. It's said that Taker was upset that Bob Orton didn't tell him he had Hepatitis. I think Orton was released afterwards & Taker took off till he appeared at the 2006 Royal Rumble to challenge Kurt Angle for the WHC.

Unforgiven (September 17, 2006)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince, Shane McMahon, & ECW Champion Big Show - Can't say I was a big fan of this. SO much so that i don't remember it since watching it for the first time when I first watched this dvd.

Survivor Series (November 18, 2007)
Undertaker Vs. World Heavyweight Champion Batista - I really enjoyed this. Taker just seems to bring something out of Batista that not even HHH was able to do. Everytime he faces Taker, Batista just gets this new unexplainable life. That's just a testament to the asset Taker is. The aftermath really adds to this already great match.

Like I said, while this is a very solid set that's worth the purchase, I wish they waited to release this as the HIAC matches are still going. They left out the SSlam 2008 HIAC match with Taker & Edge which was the standout for me as I was there live, front row to witness Taker's return. It sucks i had to buy the SSlam 2998 dvd just for that. Cena vs Batista was a great match too. But Taker/Edge was the real highlight for me & had that been on here, I could've saved.....don't remember exactly but between $20 - $30. Still, buy this set if you haven't yet along with the Elimination Chamber set which I'll review soon.",1310169600,,6187,4.284246575342466
3305818,4,B00120LPQK,"With nine hours of matches on the DVDs, it's hard to go wrong.  Of course there is the classic Foley vs. Mankind match, and the first HIAC match with Taker and Michaels.  Personally, I can't stand Triple H so his ridiculous DX match did nothing for me.  It just reminded me of a horrible era in WWE, which continues to this day.  However, his match with Nash is surprisingly decent.  Another surprisingly good match was Batista vs. Taker.

Not all of the matches are classic, but none are terrible.  It's too bad that WWE ran this gimmick into the ground with the unnecessary Hell in a Cell pay per view, as it was hands down their coolest match for a few years.

Would have been nice to have some special features, but Foley does a good job at hosting.  If you like Hell in a Cell, don't see any reason why not to pick it up.",1297468800,2,826,4.243589743589744

3305822,5,B00120LPQK,"Hell in a Cell lives up to its nicknames, out of every variation of a cage match, this match is truely demonic and brutal. I mean look at its track record, or careers shortened. Its the only cage match with no stipulations, its just a very hardcore match within a 25 ft (or so cage).

Now as for the dvd. Its on 3 discs and includes almost every Hell in a cell from Michaels/Taker to Taker/Batista. The only ones in between that were left out were Taker/Bossman and Snow/Bossman (although it technically wasn't and it was one of the worst matches ever). Before each match, Mick Foley does an intro within a mini hell in a cell enclosed in a studio and they show clips of the events leading into them.

The Hell in a cells that are included are:

Taker vs Michaels (Bad Blood 97): Possibly one the greatest HIAC matches, this set the bar for all Cell matches to come. 5 out of 5

Taker/Austin vs Kane/Mankind (Raw 98): Wasnt really a match, all it was Austin fighting Mankind and Kane outside of the cell and Taker beating the living hell out of Paul Bearer. The bell was never even rung. Was really a filler for the dvd, half decent since Bearer got bloodied. 2.5/5

Taker vs Mankind (King of the ring 98)- Now this was the greatest, since it was really brutal for Mankind, this match gave Foley one of his distinct looks...his missing front teeth. It possibly had the biggest ""Oh My God"" moment in wrestling history. 5/5

Kane vs Mankind (Raw 98): Like the tag team match, this is pretty much a filler, although unlike the tag this did officially start and was an actual match. It did however end in a no descion and had its moments. 3.5/5

HHH vs Cactus Jack (No Way Out 00): This was Mick Foley's last HIAC he would wrestle in and was it memorable. Sure it wasn't no where as impact as the one he fought at KOTR but the match did have its moments, this was HHH's first of many HIAC matches he has had in his career. 4.5/5

6 way- Angle vs HHH vs Rock vs Rikishi vs Taker vs Austin (Armageddon 00): This was another pretty decent match, but most of the damage happened outside of the cell, either near the stage or on top. The match probably would have ended outside but the rules said the descion had to be in the ring. Like most HIAC this had its moments leaving everyone bloody. 4/5

HHH vs Jericho (Judgement day 02): Match was pretty good, this was really Jericho's last real good match for a while. They did whatever you would expect. 3.5/5

Taker vs Lesnar (Survivor Series 02): Now this I had mixed feelings about. It featured at the time 2 of wwe's top stars. Lesnar who combines brute strengh with technical, was really out of his confort zone, the match was of course very bloody and brutal not great but good. 3.5/5

HHH vs Nash (Bad Blood 03): Some say this was the worst non Raw HIAC (excluding Snow/Bossman) since well Nash has very weak knees, even it looked like it was back and forth, it was on sided as it was too predictable. 2/5

HHH vs Michaels (Bad Blood 04): Now this was a great match. Truely the best these two have wrestled in together. Not the best, but to me maybe 3rd best behind Taker/Michaels and Taker/Mankind. 5/5

HHH vs Batista (Vengeance 05): Kind of like Taker/Lesnar, at this point wwe was really trying push Batista and Cena, they gave Batista the title and decided to put him in the cell with HHH. Good overall. 3.5/5

Taker vs Orton (Armageddon 05): Some say this was pretty much a street fight in a HIAC as both men mainly used weapons,even busting Bob Orton open which a lot of people didn't agree with. I have to agree. Sure the match was entertaining and brutal but they could have done more. 4/5

DX vs The McMahons and Big Show (Unforgiven 06): This match had its moments, which one of which you can never forget and thats a bad thing. Brutal as you would expect. 3.5/5

Taker vs Batista (Survivor Series 07). Same as Batista/HHH. It was brutal with brute strengh vs Phenom and had a suprise ending which no one saw coming but it could have been better 3.5/5

Great overall dvd, could have had Taker/Bossman and maybe waited to release so they could add Taker/Edge which was another great one that I would have given a 5/5. Would have excluded the raw tag team one, since nothing really happened.",1272585600,2,4246,4.3816793893129775
3305823,5,B00120LPQK,"Try as I may, I can't imagine a better collection of matches than Hell in a Cell. As much as I'm a mark for behind the scenes, real-life dirt, sometimes you just want to enjoy some great wrestling. Especially now, since it's so difficult to find. I hear great things about some of the current indies, but I only get WWE and TNA, and both products have had poor years creatively. This brutal collection will come as a jolt to those who are conditioned to today's watered-down, for kids only WWE. Every one of the 14 matches contained on this 3-disc set has blood...and occasionally, an absurd amount. Of course, those of us who have been watching for years and enjoy the process behind the theatrics knows that blading creates a psychological effect on an audience, lending an aura of importance. And in the world of pro wrestling, some of these bouts are very important indeed.
The masterpiece, of course, the one match every fan, no matter how big or average, how old or young, needs to own on DVD is the June, 1998 match from the King of the Ring PPV. The combatants: The Undertaker and Mick Foley. What Foley accomplishes in this ultra-violent war will never be duplicated by anyone, not intentionally anyway. The fall from the top of the cage through the announcers table, the unbelievably vicious powerslam through the top of the cage to the mat, and the chokeslam on the masses of thumbtacks are the brutal highlights. Foley's introductions and commentary on each match is just icing.
There are a number of legit 4 to 5 star classics here-Taker vs Michaels, the six-man for the WWE championship, Taker-Lesner, HBK vs Trips, D-X vs. the McMahons and Big Show in a stunningly gruesome handicap match...there's not a dud on this collection. It's also proof ECW wasn't the only promotion delivering the hardcore in the late 90's. If you're already a big fan, you probably own this. If you're just getting started, make this one of your very first purchases, and see what got everyone so rabid about this business.

The compilation of these matches into one place shows how the creative minds in the WWE have worked to keep the HIAC angle fresh and captivating for its audience. Although its most known for Mick Foley's superhuman fall off of the cell in 1998, HIAC has also played host to some great traditional wrestling and even some comedy/squash in addition to the hardcore style that it is most known for.

The format of the DVD is great in that it recaps the feuds that the wrestlers were entangled in leading up to the HIAC match itself, with footage from Raw, SmackDown, and PPV's. As many wrestling fans know, the production value of WWE is top notch. Their video team really exemplifies the drama and the glory of their storylines. The only critique I have of this DVD is that the entire thing is hosted by Mick Foley. I would have loved to see more in-depth interview reactions from more of the wrestlers involved in the matches.

The match that literally nearly killed the hardcore legend and personified the most brutal invention by the WWE. Little do many casual wrestling fans know that there have been many more Hell In A Cell matches since that dreaded night. This collection brings almost all of the Hell In A Cell matches in history together for your sick enjoyment.

Hosting this fantastic DVD set is the man who nearly died, the Hardcore Legend, Mick Foley. He tells us the fantastic story of the creation of the Hell In A Cell match and gives us a brief introduction before every match. Mick Foley is a great choice as the host of this DVD as there's no denying that without that very famous match, we wouldn't see as many Hell In A Cell matches follow as they did.

Disc 1

Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels: Badd Blood - October 5th 1997

One amazing WWE debut for this speciality match and a lot of back and forth action between the two, which culminated in a decent spot that landed Shawn Michaels through one of the announce tables. Top that Mick Foley.

Kane & Mankind vs Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer & Stone Cold: Raw - June 15th 1998

I've not seen this match myself, but from what I've heard, it was one of those defining matches and being on Raw gave the HIAC even more exposure for what was to come.

Undertaker vs Mankind: King Of The Ring - June 28th 1998

Well this truly was the defining match that emphasised the sheer brutality of this match. It started off on top of the cell and within the first few minutes, that memorable image happened creating the phrase that JR will always be remembered for ""Good god almighty they killed him."" I don't know who they are, but I certainly felt the same when watching this match. That wasn't the end of it, however, and Mick being Mick wanted more and he got more.

Triple H vs Cactus Jack: No Way Out - February 27th 2000

This was the match that was to retire Mick Foley and bring an end to a long standing feud that saw him get beaten up time and time again.

Kurt Angle vs Stone Cold vs The Rock vs Rikishi vs Undertaker vs Triple H: Armageddon - December 10th 2000

Oh My God, this match is easily one of my favourite matches in WWE history by far. There was an attempt in it to recreate the famous ""oh my god"" moment by having Rikishi thrown off the cell. There were a few brilliant spots and some great action all round with one of the best endings ever.

Disc 2

Triple H vs Chris Jericho: Judgment Day - May 19th 2002

Their Wrestlemania match wasn't brilliant, but this match sure made up for it. Chris Jericho took a real beating in this match and without the insane spots, it showed why this is called the career shortening match.

Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar: No Mercy - October 20th 2002

Brock Lesnar made his debut in WWE at the start of the year and within only a few months became one of the biggest names and the most dominant forces in the WWE. Undertaker wanted to put a stop to that and he thought that job would be much more easier on his home turf of the Cell. Undertaker underestimated Brock and we had a brilliantly brutal back and forth match that cemented Brocks image of being the dominant one.

Triple H vs Kevin Nash: Badd Blood - June 15th 2003

Nothing to shout about really, they had a really good feud and this was a good way to end it. Other than that it's not very memorable.

Triple H vs Shawn Michaels: Badd Blood - June 13th 2004

Well before this initial match they had one hell of a feud which was to come to an end in possibly one of the best and most sadistic matches in the specialities history. They really beat the hell out of each other and it's surprising that they are still able to move today after such a confrontation.

Disc 3

Batista vs Triple H: Vengeance - June 26th 2005

I'm not a massive fan of Batista and really hated the idea of seeing him in a Hell in a Cell match, but thanks to Triple H this match wasn't too bad. A lot of back and forth brutality taking advantage of both superstars strengths.

Undertaker vs Randy Orton: Armageddon - December 18th 2005

I loved this feud, but I felt a bit let down by this match as it really wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I hope that knowing how readily willing Randy is to take a beating these days and put his body on the line, we will see him return to a HIAC against someone like Shane McMahon or even HHH.

D-X vs Shane & Vince McMahon and the Big Show: Unforgiven - September 17th 2006

This was a really surprisingly good match and the McMahons took one hell of a beating at the hands of D-X. The ending was spectacularly amusing and a bit disgusting.

Undertaker vs Batista: Survivor Series - November 18th 2007

I don't like Batista and I didn't enjoy this match as much as I thought I would as I've always held the idea that Undertaker can make anyone look good. Apparently Batista can't be made to look good even by the best there is.

A fantastic collection that anyone will enjoy.",1235433600,,5087,4.289748953974895
3305827,5,B00120LPQK,"THIS IS THE HELL IN A CELL, THE UNDERTAKER'S ULTIMATE MIND GAME, HIS FAVORITE WEAPON, AND HIS INTIMIDATING, BRUTAL PLAYGROUND! THE UNDERTAKER WAS IN THE FIRST HELL IN A CELL MATCH, ON OCTOBER 5, 1997. EVEN THOUGH HE UNVICTORIOUS, BECAUSE OF HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, KANE. BUT HE CONFRONTED THE MASTER OF HARDCORE, MANKIND (MICK FOLEY, DUDE LOVE, CACTUS JACK), AND MADE HISTORY BY THROWING MANKIND, OFF OF THE CELL, THROUGH THE ANNOUNCE TABLE. WHAT WAS SO SURPRISING, ABOUT THE WHOLE BATTLE, WAS THAT THE PHENOM, THE UNDERTAKER, CHOKE-SLAMMED THE 300-POUND MANKIND, AGAIN, ONLY ON THE TOP OF THE CELL, DOWN INTO THE RING, IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANKIND COULD STILL BATTLE UNDERTAKER, AFTER BEING SLAMMED, AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE REST OF THE HELL IN A CELL MATCHES AREN'T REALLY AS SURPRISING AS THE 1ST TWO.",1235001600,,795,4.896296296296296

AS You can see from my ratings (as I won't go into horribly long detail about my opinion EVERY MATCH ROCKS... This DVD set is very well worth it and you will not regret your purchase that much a can guarantee you.",1233705600,,1899,4.764525993883792
3305829,5,B00120LPQK,"I thought this DVD was fantastic.  While mostly a fan of Mick Foley's work in the demonic structure called ""Hell in a Cell"", I was pleased to see some great matches outside of Foley's work.  Lesnar/Undertaker was sadistic, while the Hunter/Micheals match was a bit melodramatic, but still an outstanding story in the Cell.

This is a must for fans of the Undertaker, who is a fixture in this hellish match, as well as Triple H, whose match with Foley is included in the first disc.

Chains, chairs, barbed wire 2/4's (set aflame), sledgehammers, steel stairs, tables, death defying falls, this has it all.

For fans of sadistic displays of violence and blood like only professional wrestling can deliver, this is the DVD for you.",1232582400,,729,4.8
3305830,5,B00120LPQK,"Well there is not much to say about this release, but it is a great collection of pretty much every Hell in the Cell ever minus Taker vs Bossman from Wm15(prob because it was the worst or because Bossman got hanged in the match and with the whole Benoit thing they didn't want to include it) and the last one they did with Edge and Taker.  So if you like wrestling or you know someone who does get this dvd you won't be disappointed.",1232236800,,433,4.154761904761905
3305831,4,B00120LPQK,"This is a great set for fans of Attitude era FEDERATION fans. That was when the best of these matches occurred. Anyway, this set is missing one match (UNDERTAKER vs BOSSMAN) but everyone knows that.

Now for the part that is annoying, at first.

They have to blur out the classic attitude era scratch logo everywhere it appears on the screen and it can be distracting at first. They also have to blur out any visual WWF's and have to censor any verbal form of the abbreviation. It's still unclear to me why they aren't allowed to use the scratch logo anymore if they can use the classic one. I am aware of the lawsuit, but it still doesn't make sense why they have to blur it out.

Aside from that this DVD set is really good. I even enjoyed the WWE era matches (I stopped watching wrestling shortly after the name change).

I recommend this disc set to anyone who loves those brutal wrestling bouts.",1231286400,,900,4.403614457831325
3305832,5,B00120LPQK,"I bought this for my 10-year son who is a WWE fanatic.  I've sat and watched some of it with him and it's very entertaining.  If you like the WWE, this video is for you.  Well worth the money!",1231286400,,192,3.871794871794872
3305833,5,B00120LPQK,I started watching WWE during the Attitude Era.  Hell in a Cell was one of the creations of that era. It's great seeing all of the these classic matches. All of them are great. Even the ones from the current era. It brings back some great memories. A must have for fans.,1228176000,,270,4.1923076923076925
3305834,5,B00120LPQK,"Brutal. Unforgiving. Satanic. Hell on Earth. These terms have been used to describe a structure, over 2 Tons of Steel, 16 Feet (now 35 feet) high(!) which has inspired terror and revulsion in many a WWE Superstar. Only 17 of these modified cage matches have taken place since 1997, and with good reason. This type of match ends or shortens careers. Ask Superstars such as Mick Foley (as Cactus Jack and Mankind), The Undertaker, Triple H (who is nearly undefeated in HIAC), Shawn Michaels, Vince and Shane McMahon, The Big Show, Brock Lesnar, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, Batista, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, The Rock, Rikishi, Randy Orton, Edge, Kane and several others. They have all been featured in this Hellish structure, and this three-disc DVD set highlights some of the most brutal ones to take place. Blood, broken bones and brutality, the three B's are the order of the day in the Devil's Playground. I would give this set a definite 5 out of 5 stars. A really excellent and action-packed DVD set. Get this one!!!",1225584000,,1030,4.792134831460674
3305835,4,B00120LPQK,"WWE's HELL IN A CELL three-disc boxed set collects (Almost....) every ""Hell In A Cell"" match since the first one way back in 1997. Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker set the bar high, with insane risks and gruesome violence, but the bar would soon be raised by Mick Foley (A.K.A. Mankind, Cactus Jack, & Dude Love), who took-risk-taking to a whole new level, with falls off of and through the Cell, chairs, thumbtacks, & flaming-barbed-wire-wrapped-two x 4's. That's part of the problem with this collection: After Foley's four deranged Cell matches, the rest, no matter how good, pale in comparison. That's one of a few small complaints I had with the set.......The others were the missing HELL IN A CELL match (The only missing one, if I'm remembering correctly....) featuring The Undertaker vs. The Big Boss Man, which is really no big loss, since I remember it being a dreadful match, but it'd be nice if it were included, if only for the sake of completeness. The last minor quibble is the lack of extras or commentaries.....It would have been great to have match-specific commentaries by some of the Superstars. But as it stands, HELL IN A CELL is a great set, running 9 hours over three discs, featuring 14 long matches, each introduced by the legendary Mick Foley himself. For old-school WWF (Yeah, I said it!!!!) fans looking to revisit the glory days, you really can't go wrong.",1225497600,,1387,4.807531380753138
3305836,5,B00120LPQK,"Although all these matches are on DVD, it's nice to have a proper set narrated by none other than Mick Foley!  There are a few matches not on this set like Kennel in a Cell and the Wrestlemania match between Boss Man and 'Taker.  Other than that, very nice layout.  Again, Mick Foley providing insight into the psyche of these matches and their effect on the wrestling world.  All in all, this is a very good addition to my WWE collection and I can't wait for other specialty matches on DVD.  Like...Best of Tables Matches ,Best of Cages (again), so on and so forth.",1224201600,,566,4.403846153846154
