4962472,5,B0066E6OTA,"I loved to watch ""Daktari"" as a teenager on German TV. I thought that Yale Summers was very attractive and until the last episode I was hoping there would be a happy end for him and Paula Tracy (Cheryl Miller who also played 4 times in ""Flipper"").

Wonderful to finally get this on DVD, but it's hopelessly over-priced for just one season. I'll wait until it will drop $30+.
If you compare prices: you get for the same amount of money the entire ""M Squad"" series with 2.866 minutes (three times as much as the first season of ""Daktari""), the first season of ""Flipper"" costs $25 for 800 minutes. As I said before, it's too expensive, but hopefully the price will drop dramatically.

Now if finally classic TV series like ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver), ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens), ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" (Australian TV series from 1965), ""The Magic Boomerang"" (Australian TV seres from the 60's) and ""77 Sunset Strip"" would be released on DVD, that would be great!!!",1321401600,25,1097,4.89247311827957

4962479,2,B0066E6OTA,"I purchased the DVD a year ago (not from Amazon). The series itself gets 5 stars. However the DVDs have been horrible. They will not play consistently (one episode will work, one will not) in dvd players and it will not play at all on the computer. Be prepared to be frustrated trying to get the dvds to play. If you can get them to play the show will be enjoyed by any animal lover.

If the show is ever released on more reliable dvds (like every other show and movie) I would purchase all seasons.",1418860800,3,499,4.197916666666667

4962486,5,B0066E6OTA,"I really liked this program when I was a kid...oh how time flies. So I was very happy when they released them on dvd..not so crazy about the price and the fact that we only have the first two seasons to choose from...want them all! Now the print quality of season one is very good..be aware that the ""full"" Daktari theme is not heard in this season..that sadly doesn't come into being until the second season. Also that this is a very ""lame"" program. The show or rather the plots are great, but the finale scripts and the acting leave much to be desired. Don't get me wrong I Love This Series...the problem is I don't know why?!? The acting is so ""laid back"" or there seems to be something, or someone in the background who's screaming ""there will be no action"". It might be the editing or the direction, but this show should  be boring and it's not!?!I don't know how many times Daktari or someone was almost killed and they just ""pat"" the bad guy on the back and let him (her) go. AND Paula, everyone loves Paula, fans love Paula, well now that I'm older I'm not so sure about that...what a pain in the butt she becomes! Still I Love This Show",1398297600,,1145,4.300925925925926

4962490,5,B0066E6OTA,I absolutely went crazy when I noticed this was actually on dvd now. I bought it and watched it as soon as I got it. It was like I flashed back to when I was a few years old again watching it was such a great delight in remembering something that I cherished from my childhood.,1372204800,3,277,3.9642857142857144

4962492,4,B0066E6OTA,"Love the show and won't give a poor rating to affect that.  However none of the DVD's in the package worked, so I'm out $$$ and no Daktari!  After reading other comments I see the problem is this is DVD-R.  Now I know to look for that and not buy any DVD's with that designation.",1364169600,,279,4.036363636363636

4962496,5,B0066E6OTA,"When I watched this TV show when I was a little girl it taught me about all the animals that live in Africa and on the planet and how important it is to protect them. To be able to see a famous lion like Clarence that was really cross-eyed every week was so very exciting and fun too. Clarence and Judy the chimpanzee are doing all kinds of things to help people and animals in trouble and it made me want to do that too. I did learn about a scary thing like a poacher and it is just so sad that someone like that is still around, but we need a new generation of people to learn just how important it is to protect the animals that live on our planet.",1357516800,3,651,3.9393939393939394
4962497,5,B0066E6OTA,"I shouted myself Daktari for my birthday as it was a bit expensive. Glad I did, loved it. Its great to watch programmes  where there is no swearing, sex and bedhopping. Everyone can enjoy them. Whats more I have just finished reading Ralph Helfers book and to know that these were some of his animals he trained was a bonus. I hope the next series is going to be a bit cheaper as that is on my must have list.  PS  I could have helped Yale Summers out at any time also.",1357171200,,469,4.076086956521739
4962498,5,B0066E6OTA,"I loved this series as a kid and dreamed of being Paula Tracy, living in Africa and working with wild animals (especially the big cats!). I didn't expect the show to charm me now as a jaded adult but once I got accustomed its slower pace, I fell in love all over again. Daktari has some timeless elements to it, most especially the light moral tales about the humane treatment of animals, and the exploitation of our natural world. It's hard to believe the series is nearly 50 years old; except for outdated vehicles and some old-fashioned clothes and hairdos, the show feels pretty current. I'm surprised Animal Planet doesn't run this show - I think young children today would still enjoy it.

The quality of the DVD was clear and the packaging was excellent with sharp and effective graphics. Too bad there weren't any special features. I hope season two comes out soon - that was my favorite season.

I got this as a Christmas gift from a very thoughtful brother-in-law who loves old TV shows. Thanks Tim! This was my favorite gift this year.",1356566400,3,1046,4.618279569892473
4962499,5,B0066E6OTA,"We had a good time with these folks and got to know them all quite well. Judy the chimp is quite a clever (and stubborn), and resourceful member of the household. You get to know more about the history of africa, and issues related to preserves, fire and the needs of various animals, including learning about the nature of beasts - all while laughing or crying.
A good time, truly.

I'd really like to see the next season, Please let me know when it's available.",1355356800,2,463,4.447058823529412
4962500,5,B0066E6OTA,"I was about ten years old when I became a huge Daktari fan. I remember those Saturday nights eagerly waiting for that adventuresome Daktari theme song. I fantasized about living in Africa on the Wameru compound, having a heroic dad like the great African doctor, being as pretty and charming as Paula Tracy, having a cute boyfriend like Jack, and all the exotic pets I could ever imagine owning. Oh, and of course riding on the back of Clarence the cross-eyed lion! And here I was, a middle aged mom and grandmother, eagerly waiting for this beloved show to come out on DVD. I knew it was just a matter of time... but it's about time!
I am totally impressed with the quality of the video and sound. Very well put together, and worth every penny.  I couldn't help but get a little misty-eyed when I started remembering those old episodes and exactly why I fell so in love with this show.  Okay, I AM a sappy sentimentalist, but I can't wait until my grand kids are old enough to share these with them. I realize they may not be as impressed, but it would be cool if they could capture just a bit of the magic I experienced as a kid, so much in love with my television heroes - both furry and human!",1355097600,3,1197,4.315555555555555

4962502,5,B0066E6OTA,"There are other more detailed reviews here so I will keep this brief. Daktari is on my personal top ten favorite TV series list. The series is well written and well acted. The scenery is beautiful, the animals are a delight. Who wouldn't like Clarence the friendly, cross-eyed lion? Or Judy the smart and sassy chimp? They are adorable! The doctor and his daughter as well as their associates at Wameru Animal Center are kind and caring individuals. This series has warmth, intelligence and compassion - qualities that are missing from today's bag of reality housewives/gossip/hip hop/nonsense that is the new TV. I am grateful to be able to enjoy Daktari again (never thought it would be released on DVD but I am so glad it's here). As far the DVD-R format my understanding is that these recordings will hold up for between 10 to 15 years. With proper care peraps they will last even longer. No complaints from me.",1352937600,5,915,4.725
4962509,4,B0066E6OTA,"I got this for my nieces, but I think I am enjoying more than they do!

4962511,5,B0066E6OTA,"I bought this DVD purely for nostalgic purposes. I remember seeing this series as a kid and  wanted to see if it was as good as I remember. It is. There is hardly any violence here but plenty of adventure. This is a family show.
Marshall Thompson is perfect as Dr Marsh Tracey. I read that he was interested and cared about wildlife. His sincere performance in this show shines through. He would be more involved in the production of season 2 and I have read that the show gets even better. He was actually bitten by one of the animals in the second season and needed stitches while the animal was sedated. This was kept in when the episode was aired. The only other person I know who sincerity shines through in his performance was Fess Parker in his own series ""Daniel Boone""
While I was a kid,for me it was all about the adventures. But now,I have come to appreciate more the hi-jinks of the chimp called Judy. She steals every scene she is in.
There is plenty of action and adventure in these stories ranging from poachers,jewel robbers,escaped prisoners to forest fires as well as trying to save the endangered wildlife.
As this is a family show,you can watch this with your kids or grandchildren. I'm sure they will enjoy it too.",1331683200,31,1235,4.488888888888889
4962512,3,B0066E6OTA,"Great to see this on DVD, but will not be buying until it is released on permanent DVD media and not recordable media (i.e. no better than a pirate copy !).  Have the first series of Flipper on Mastered DVD but the second has been released on recordable media, so will not be buying this either.

I would be willing to pay more for a properly produced series, although I cannot see why this should be necessary - there are plenty of series on Mastered DVD's (i.e. not recordable media) released more cheaply than this series.",1329177600,13,525,4.458333333333333
4962513,5,B0066E6OTA,I was young when this series first appeared - but it was one of my favorites.  I have been trying to find it on DVD for YEARS.  I was so thrilled to see it appear recently on Amazon.  It is a little pricey - but not bad and well worth the money.  The quality of the set is excellent.  I have only have 2 more episodes to watch and hope the other 2 seasons come follow soon.  A good quality set that I highly recommend to Daktari fans out there!,1328054400,8,444,3.8777777777777778
4962514,5,B0066E6OTA,"This is a great series for animal lovers. Good stories for the whole family. The transfer could be better but it is good enough. Only a few spots need improvement. I wish they would hurry and bring out series 2,3 and 4.",1327449600,8,219,4.238095238095238

4962518,4,B0066E6OTA,"For lovers of classic television, much progress has been made in getting most of the significant series from the 1960's released on DVD, particularly in the last decade.  However, there remain some notable exceptions, particularly in the case of series involving animals.  Some that come to mind are Lassie, and the Ivan Tors' productions Gentle Ben, Flipper (only Season One so far), and Daktari.  Fortunately, this is about to change, as the first season of Daktari (1966-69), a series set in Africa is being released on DVD-R.

""Daktari"" is Swahili for ""doctor"".  This unique series has a memorable theme song that features the Swahili language, native instruments, and wild animal cries.  The program centers on the adventures of veterinarian Marsh Tracy (Marshall Thompson), who along with his beautiful daughter Paula (Cheryl Miller) runs the Wameru Study Center for Animal Behavior, a research facility located in the east African bush.  Daktari is adapted from the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarence-The-Cross-Eyed-Lion/dp/B0066E6OIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarence, The Cross-Eyed Lion</a>&nbsp;(1965), which also starred Thompson and Miller, as well as Judy, a super intelligent chimpanzee, and the aforementioned Clarence, who suffers from some vision problems.

Helping the Tracy's, are a pair of robust young men, Jack Dane (Yale Summers) and Mike Makula (Hari Rhodes).  The Wameru facility, commonly referred to as ""the compound"", provides shelter and refuge from the dangers of the bush.  The animals are threatened by things like disease, weather, predators, poachers, and thieves.  The local law enforcement is represented by District Officer Hedley (Hedley Mattingley).

The episodes and broadcast dates from the first season are listed below.

1. The Elephant Thieves (1/11/1966)
2. Predator of Wameru (1/18/1966)
3. Killer Lion (1/25/1966)
4. Adventure of the Lion Cubs (2/1/1966)
5. Trail of the Cheetah (2/8/1966)
6. Leopard of Madla Gorge (2/15/1966)
7. The Diamond Smugglers (3/1/1966)
8. The Chimp Who Went Ape (3/8/1966)
9. The Killer Dog (3/15/1966)
10. Return of the Killer - Part 1 (3/22/1966)
11. Return of the Killer - Part 2 (3/29/1966)
12. The Maneater of Wameru (4/5/1966)
13. Crisis at the Compound (4/12/1966)
14. The Hostages (4/19/1966)
15. Judy and the Hyena (4/26/1966)
16. Wall of Flames - Part 1 (5/3/1966)
17. Wall of Flames - Part 2 (5/10/1966)
18. Judy and the Gunrunners (5/17/1966)

My childhood memories of Daktari are a little hazy, but I'm fairly certain that like Flipper, this was a very family friendly program, that advocated the humanitarian treatment of living things.  I still have some Daktari bubble gum cards that I got way back then, and hope to revisit the series and learn what it was really about.  My impression was that Dr. Marsh Tracy was a very dignified and resourceful man, while Officer Headley was a rather excitable chap, with a heavy British accent.  Hari Rhodes, a fine actor also with a distinctive voice, joined other actors of African-American heritage, like Bill Cosby and Ivan Dixon, as a series regular on a prime time program, something that was still uncommon in 1966.  The program's loudest performer, and active scene stealer was Judy the chimp, who is quite prone to throwing tantrums.  As this release is on DVD-R, the five disc set might not contain any extras, but hopefully image quality will be good.",1323043200,15,3449,5.401119402985074
