4428709,5,B004M7YRM4,very moving and tells a great story a must see ! I was very impressed with the actors in the film. The story takes place in my home town so it meant a little more to me,1372032000,2,168,3.5675675675675675
4428710,5,B004M7YRM4,"My parents and I watched this movie together and we LOVED it!  My father was born in Mexico and he was truly moved by it.  He said this was one of the few movies that captured the true essesnce of the Latin culture.  He said the generosity of the people and the adventurous spirit were all there.  He plans on buying a copy for all of his (9) brothers and sisters.
I would say it should be on EVERYONE's must see list.",1309219200,10,418,4.060975609756097
4428711,5,B004M7YRM4,"This movie is revealing, hilarious, smart, a little bit madcap and touching all at once. I loved it. It opens up a world I don't know much about and presents characters that I love knowing about. The road trip storyline is almost a romp at times, but the film has emotional depth (the roles are really well-crafted), cultural insights (Mexican immigration), documentary qualities (the perils of border-crossing) and some killer visuals, too. So it's an all-around awesome movie.",1307577600,5,478,5.141025641025641
4428712,5,B004M7YRM4,"Saw this film at the Latino film fest here in NY about 2 years ago..and was really blown away..not only cause I know many of the players in the film, but because of its story..production values and artistry..hard to believe it was done on the fly w/minimal budget..Aside from that it, its scope and ideas  and entertainment values are on a par w/a budget of a Spielberg film..Funny, poignant, moving..and in the end a fun 2hrs.
  A young man from a Mexican border town sets out to find his father who is in a jail in Texas..setting off search, not only for his father but within himself..You'll enjoy this.",1300147200,3,606,4.541284403669724
4428713,5,B004M7YRM4,Non-traditional border story with a heart and funny as hell. It's as if I actually lived with them on this Journey. Lot's of twists and turns.,1300060800,2,142,4.5
4428714,5,B004M7YRM4,This is one of those rare films that is filled with nostalgia and adventure but is also hilarious! I saw it at a film festival in NY and then again in Los Angeles and I have to say it is extraordinary.,1299628800,3,201,3.926829268292683
4428715,5,B004M7YRM4,"This is a great independent film! I got to see it at a local film festival. So funny and so much heart. It is ""El Norte"" meets Napolean Dynamite"". The characters are so unique and well acted. If you like independent films, you will love this crazy journey. It is full of surprises!",1299542400,,281,4.320754716981132

4428721,4,B004M7YRM4,"It was a funny movie with some drama. If you are looking for a deep movie on social change, this isn't your movie. If you are looking at some light humor with a little drama. Give it a look.",1434153600,,190,3.8974358974358974

4428726,2,B004M7YRM4,"The movie is not bad. I watch it for the sake of learning spanish and to learn more about latin counteries cultures. The movie achieved this objective for me, and greautly familiarized me with the Mexican culture  . But the story itself is very poor and borig in sometimes.",1425340800,,273,4.571428571428571
4428727,1,B004M7YRM4,"Hated it. Not what I thought it would be, but I guess I would have known that if I read the promo. I couldn't make it past 20 minutes. I'm sure that someone looking for crude humor would think its fine. Just not my thing . . .",1425081600,,226,3.7291666666666665
4428728,4,B004M7YRM4,The movie was much better than I was expecting.  It was a poignant story with very good actors.  The dialogue was short and to the point and so fairly easy for me to translate.  A good learning tool.,1422230400,,199,4.184210526315789

4428731,3,B004M7YRM4,"As a human rights worker, my opinion is skewed by all the things I know about the miseries of crossing the border.  But, for a light introduction on the subject for kids, this is amusing enough.  Probably most people haven't the stomach for truth.",1396569600,,247,4.590909090909091
4428732,5,B004M7YRM4,"I felt that I was watching the actors through a car window, like if they were part of an old comic magazine. Excellent movie.",1396396800,,125,4.25
4428733,3,B004M7YRM4,"This was just plain weird. Events didn't connect and the main character was the weirdest of them all, no personality",1391299200,,116,4.85
4428734,5,B004M7YRM4,"For Amazon to tell us that this is not one of the ""earnest"" films about the borderlands is to completely miss it's authenticity. I have lived on the border for 30 years. Gringo or Mexicano, everyone  has a border story. This is a fine film that rings completely true. The absurdity is only a relief valve, an absurdity that is genuine in Mexican culture. When you have no more tears, no more broken hearts, no more dreams, you laugh. This is an honest portrayal of the borderlands with a huge beating, blood pumping  Mexican heart.",1383177600,3,531,4.578947368421052
4428735,5,B004M7YRM4,"This film poignantly illuminates the physical, emotional, and spiritual struggle of cruzando (crossing), reminding us- no matter our politics- of the humanity behind the ""issue"" of illegal immigration.  Anyone with a background or interest in the Mexican-American experience will be drawn in and enjoy the ride as the main character metaphorically crosses from abandon and indifference into acceptance and clarity of purpose.  The heavy theme is brilliantly shrouded by colorful, lovable characters and an understated hilarity throughout.  I laughed and cried.

Powerful acting.  Breathtaking scenery.  A new favorite of mine.

P.S.  If you're even remotely interested in seeing this but have reservations because you don't know Spanish, don't be deterred.  The dialog is minimal, and you'll be quickly immersed in the story, likely forgetting you're reading subtitles.",1373414400,3,869,5.7795275590551185

8435615,4,B004M7YRM4,"With all of the ""build that wall"" sentiment abroad in the land, this is the perfect antidote: a really sweet, funny movie about the US-Mexico border, the people who cross it, and the complicated reasons for doing so. Very much like early Jim Jarmusch (especially Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law), with a Keatonesque performance by the lead. Spanish (mostly) with subtitles.",1470700800,,380,5.0476190476190474
