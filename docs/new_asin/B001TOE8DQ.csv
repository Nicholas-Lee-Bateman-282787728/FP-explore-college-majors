8342186,5,B001TOE8DQ,"A long time ago, I purchased Steve Grody's JKD Trapping Hand series on VHS tape. Since then, I've loaned them out to friends, and eventually lost them. This is the same series he did back in the early 90's, but now its on DVD. This is absolutely excellent material, and I still refer to it. Hopefully the other video series' he's done will be coming out on DVD soon as well!

For those who aren't familiar with this, he had a 4 volume series on JKD trapping. This is Volume 1 in that series. The entire series goes through the various traps that are used by Wing Chun, but within the context of the JKD curriculum.",1239494400,9,614,4.293103448275862
