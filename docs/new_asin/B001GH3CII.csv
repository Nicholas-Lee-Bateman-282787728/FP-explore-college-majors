3611074,5,B001GH3CII,"My kids like this one over the other DVD for sure! It feels like Paul Wilbur is in our livingroom singing, praising, dancing, and worshipping with us. My 2yr old and 3 yr old love to watch this and dance around the livingroom. They will also just sit on the couch and watch it. Talk about wholesome entertainment!!",1320278400,3,314,4.431034482758621
3611075,5,B001GH3CII,"OF ALL THE CD AND DVD WORSHIP VIDEOS THIS ONE AND THE OTHER 2 OF PAUL WILBURS are about the best and I've been a believer for 35 years.  I believe worship has come full circle with Messianic Praise.  Jesus was Jewish and this kind of worship will bring this back to the mind of any Gentile (which I am) worshipper.  The Spirit of God truly moves through this Praise.  I can recommend nothing better, but his other 2 Praise DVD's.",1281052800,17,429,4.2592592592592595
3611076,5,B001GH3CII,"If you are called to Praise and Worship your Lord (aren't we all!)
Then you should love any of Paul Wilbur music. He is about all I want listen to. You know The Lord formed Israel for himself. They have been worshipping G_D for 100's of generations, they know what they are doing! If you love the Word of God, it is here in this music. I have moved many people to this man, and no one has ever left his CD's behind. He has been anointed for this day and time, right before the return of Our Lord! He will teach you how to worship and you will love it all the way.",1269648000,10,563,3.9473684210526314

3611111,5,B001GH3CII,"Since I began searching for Paul Wilbur's recordings several years ago, I knew there was some unique feelings in the songs and the worshipping that was totally awesome, and really getting the viewer closer to God, and merging into the whole of that  meeting there, I just love that kind of adoration, and I have been subtly in my heart shifting from my traditional worship to God toward this more original way of telling how deep is my love for Christ",1368921600,,451,4.567901234567901

3611121,4,B001GH3CII,"Paul Wilbur is a great Messianic Worship singer and leader. His concerts and songs really turn one's eyes to the living God. I gave this concert only 4 starts because the Jerusalem Arise concert DVD is musically superior to this one. In the later concert, Paul Wilbur is more mature musically and the production is superior. If you are only going to buy one DVD, buy the Jerusalem Arise.",1327104000,2,387,4.6231884057971016
