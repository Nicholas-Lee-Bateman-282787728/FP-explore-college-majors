It came in just in a clear plastic cd case and the back of the dvd has a LOT of scratches!! Have not played it yet, but IT was not what I was expecting!! Depending on how it plays I may give more stars or take away one...",1334793600,,394,3.9375
7908827,1,B00000G3RD,"When this came, the DVD package that holds both the DVDs was completely destroyed. I'm hoping the movies still play okay as they don't appear to have any scratches on them. I like buying the sets in which it has both movies in one case which helps as I'm a big movie collector. However, because the DVD case was completely destroyed, I really didn't 'save' anything.",1305936000,,366,4.5606060606060606
