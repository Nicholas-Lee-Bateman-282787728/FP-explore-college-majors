""A Successful Failure"" marks the directorial debut of Arthur Luben, an entertainment legend in his own right. Luben graduated from silent film actor and worked his way up through the ranks to become a successful motion picture and television director and producer. He directed Abbott & Costello's early films and created the highly successful  ""Francis the Talking Mule"" series. When Luben entered the world of televison, he created the cult classic ""Mr. Ed"" along with many other great series.

Now to focus on Luben's early work ""A Successful Failure."" This film centers around the somewhat mundane life of Ellery Cushing, an aging family man who works at the local newspaper as a copy reader. His eyes are giving out on him and he is starting to make mistakes. The new editor, who is looking for any excuse to clean out the old newspaper staff, has his eye on Ellery for a future pinkslip.

In the meantime, Ellery's family is constantly badgering him to ""be a man"" and go ask the new editor for a raise. He has a grown son and daughter who both still live at home. The son likes to lounge on the couch and complain about how tired he is, mainly from avoiding his many creditors.

The cute, blond daughter is running around with older men and considering giving herself to the first ""Sugar Daddy"" who can provide her with the lifestyle she craves. She hasn't found the right one yet, but she's always hopeful. In the process, she treats her hard working boyfriend Phil, who wants to marry her, with indifference. Phil is a reporter at the same newspaper where Ellery works.

Ellery gets fired before he can ask for his raise, and Phil, in a fit of anger, tells off the new editor and resigns. Phil learns of a huge stockpile of humorous stories that Ellery had written for the paper, but the new editor refused to read.

So Phil pitches the stories to a radio station owner and gets Ellery a job on the radio as ""Uncle Dudley."" Ellery, in this new persona, reads his humorous observations on life during the noon hour when a lot of familes listened to the radio while having lunch. ""Uncle Dudley"" becomes an overnight sensation.

Ellery's family members are fans of Uncle Dudley and have no idea who is portraying the homespun radio philosopher. His family has some lessons to learn about the real world, and ""Uncle Dudley"" hopes to be able to turn them around with his gentle humor and wisdom.

Alpha's DVD version of this film is surprisingly good, both in picture and sound. This easy going film may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it a fun way to spend 62 minutes.",1315267200,,2658,4.5928270042194095
