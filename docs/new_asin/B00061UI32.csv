8036611,5,B00061UI32,"I have been a fan of David Nunn's work for a long time.  This DVD continues the excellent tradition.  It's perfect in giving a bird's eye view of the sites related to the earthly life of the Lord Jesus.  The chronology is very good, the photography perfect, the enthusiasm of the narrator appropriate, and the spiritual lessons excellent.  I also appreciated this DVD being an ""extended version.""  This DVD does not disappoint!",1353369600,,427,4.875
