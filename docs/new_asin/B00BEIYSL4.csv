5593166,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Yes, the movie had wit, warmth, and nostalgia, but what astonished me was its realistic portrayal of British author P. L. Travers as the adult child of an alcoholic  a brilliantly creative woman who hadn't recourse to therapy but used her fiction to process childhood issues, meanwhile resorting to outlandish control and intimidation tactics to cope with daily life.

Remarkably for a Disney production, the film doesnt flinch while addressing that childhood: Travers grew up with an alcohol-addicted father, and the movie shows him dying from cirrhosis of the liver  in contrast to the pussyfooting Wikipedia bio, which blames influenza.

I hadn't expected anything like this and was startled by the toughness and integrity of the script, direction, and Thompson's performance as Travers. I also applaud the production for not whitewashing the Disney studios or Disney himself. Only the very ending seemed to entail artistic license: it introduced a note of hope that the 1964 Mary Poppins premiere moved Travers to experience some psychic growth. After reading about her final years, I suspect it didn't and wonder if she died with unfinished business. My verdict in any case: an unexpectedly great film with virtuosic but truthful work from Thompson and a Disney of believable humanity from Hanks.",1387497600,3,1301,5.270531400966184
5593167,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is the story of how Walt Disney came to make what is now regarded as his masterpiece: the much seen and much loved Mary Poppins, which was based on the series of very popular childrens books by P.L. Travers.  Or rather, this _a_ version of the story.  A somewhat sanitized and highly romanticized version.  The real story unfolded rather differently.  But that said, Saving Mr. Banks is at its heart, after all, a story and not a documentary, and in that context it's a highly enjoyable story.

Directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Rookie) from a screenplay by Kelly Marcel (Terra Nova) and Sue Smith, (The Road from Coorain), Saving Mr. Banks is set in California in 1961 but flashes back to Australia in 1907 and Travers' early childhood.

Walt Disney (winningly played by Tom Hanks) has a problem.  Many years ago, when his two daughters were quite young, he made a promise to them that he would make a movie of their favorite story-book character, Mary Poppins, the heroine of the series of popular books by English author P.L. Travers.  His problem is that Travers (a bravura performance by Emma Thompson) doesn't want to sell him the screen rights to make the movie and has been refusing to do so for two decades.  But Ms. Travers also has a problem - money.  Her books aren't selling as well as they once did, and the only way out of her financial situation seems to be agreeing to meet with Disney about finally selling him the screen rights.  This quickly becomes a clash between Disney's charming but determined irresistible force and Travers' seemingly immovable objections to everything about the project, which despite her needs she seems determined to prevent.  It seems that the negotiations are doomed to fail, but then, as we have come expect from anything Disney ""like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through"".  How that happens, and why, is what the movie is really about.

The performances are excellent.  Tom Hanks' Disney is engaging, showing the man's charm and his frustrations but also his determination to realize his dream.  It's interesting that in some ways Hanks may end up competing with himself at Oscar time for his performance in this year's Captain Phillips, where he also played a man caught up in a clash of wills, albeit a more desperate one.  Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility, Howard's End) is a certainty for an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a very complex Travers, showing how Mary Poppins was not merely a literary creation - it was her way of trying to reconcile her inner conflicts over her difficult childhood, in particular her relationship with her father, Travers Goff, the real-life basis for the Mr. Banks of the title.  Colin Farrell gives a stand-out performance as Goff, one of the best of his career, showing the man's complex nature, from his all-too-obvious flaws to the part of him that still managed to endear himself in his daughter's memory.  Paul Giamatti shows his nice side as Ralph, Traver's driver, who gives her a sympathetic ear to turn to in the midst of people she deems adversaries.  One of the more moving scenes in the movie occurs when Giamatti's Ralph explains to Travers just why he's so seemingly focused on the weather and why every sunny day is a good day.  It's rather startling actually to see Giamatti play nice after having just seen his decidedly nasty turn as a slave dealer in 12 Years a Slave.  The Disney creative team was particularly well done. Bradley Whitford (The Good Guys, The West Wing) plays Don DaGradi, Disney's top screenwriter, and B.J. Novak (The Office, Inglourious Basterds) and Jason Schwartzman (Moonrise Kingdom, The Darjeeling Limited) are remarkably paired as the song-writing brothers Robert and Richard Sherman, all of whom are just as anxious as Disney to win Travers over. Their scenes give remarkable insight into the creative process involved not only in adapting a novel for film but in adapting to try and please and/or placate a difficult author at the same time.

Also worth noting is the musical score by Thomas Newman (Wall-E, Skyfall) which nicely adds to the emotions being displayed on the screen and evokes the varying time and place of the scenes, using wistful lilting melodies and occasional subdued overtones for Travers' childhood in rural Australia and more modern sounds with a slightly faster pace for 1960's California. It's something of a challenge to pull off without the shifts feeling jarring but Newman manages it quite well. And equally impressive is John Schwartzman's cinematography as it brings both settings to vivid life, seamlessly switching from one to the other as the story unfolds.

But as I indicated at the beginning, one should remember that this is a more than a little sanitized and sentimentalized version of not only the events that took place but of the people themselves, particularly Disney and Travers. For example, at no point in the film is Hanks' Disney ever seen smoking even though for most of his adult life Disney was a notorious chain-smoker, ultimately dying of lung cancer just two years after the Mary Poppins film was released). Neither is there any real hint of how ruthless and even cold Disney could be. The Disney you see here is the warm ""Uncle Walt"" version that he carefully crafted for himself, not the man who notoriously sacked child actor Bobby Driscoll after the release of Peter Pan or Tommy Kirk, star of many Disney films and the Mickey Mouse Club TV show, after he found out that Kirk was gay. Thompson's P.L. Travers also gets a scrubbing, making her an overly fussy and lonely but oh-so-proper Englishwoman, completely at odds with her rather Bohemian younger years and the multiple romantic relationships she had in her life with members of both sexes. And who in reality never married even though in the film she repeatedly insists on being addressed as ""Mrs. Travers"". Nor is there anything but the slightest hint of her adopted son, the story of which would have revealed her own rather cold and ruthless side. But again, this isn't a documentary - it's a story, and as such should be enjoyed for what it is. No more, no less.

One final note - make sure to stay through the end credits, where they not only show photos of all of the real people depicted in the film but also play one of the actual tape-recorded planning sessions between Travers and the Disney team. Those scenes - along with the ones of Travers' early childhood in Australia - were the most factually accurate parts of the movie.

Highly recommended as an entertaining version of an important episode of Disney movie history.  The real-life version is out there for anyone who wants to look it up and it's quite interesting in its own right, but this version is the one you'll want to take your kids to see.",1387497600,186,6831,4.781648258283773
5593168,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This film is a pleasure to watch.  The acting feels so natural.  Both Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are terrific!  Watching Tom Hanks, it's difficult to believe he's not Walt Disney.

The story lines are interesting, and two tales are successfully woven together throughout the movie:  Travers' story, and that of the acquisition of the rights to the book which Disney wants to film. It's multi-dimensional on a number of levels.

The movie simply flows, without confusion.  It could have easily felt too long, but does not.  It's engrossing from start to finish..  It's also visually well done.

Saving Mr. Banks Movie Review
Winds in the east, mist coming in
Like something is brewing and about to begin.
Can't put my finger on what lies in store
But I fear what's to happen, all happened before...

Saving Mr. Banks is the story of how Walt got P. L. Travers to give him the rights to Mary Poppins.

Pamela Travers (Emma Thompson) is broke, and her agent finally gets her to go see Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who's been trying to get the rights to Mary Poppins for 20 years. She is loath to give up the rights to Mary, especially to a man who she's convinced will turn her into another Tinkerbell or Mickey Mouse.

She is obstinate and quite frankly, a bitch with a bad attitude. Pretty much from the outset, it's pretty clear she isn't going to agree to anything Walt, the boys (B. J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) or Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) want to do for the movie, making ridiculous demands that she knows won't be met. (At one point, she demands the color red not be allowed in the film.)

The story is sort of an odd duck, in that it's set in 1961, but probably a full third of the movie is another storyline in the form of flashbacks to 1906. Those flashbacks are of Travers as a child (Annie Rose Buckley), while she still lived in Australia, and are mostly about the relationship Travers had with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell).

At the outset of the movie, the two storylines are seemingly quite divergent, but as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that the reason Travers is so obstinate, why so many things are wrong with what the boys and DaGradi want to do, is because she strongly identifies Mr. Banks with her idolized father, but nobody at Disney understands this, nor the reasons for her seemingly inane demands. Things come to a head when the timelines actually converge, an extremely clever way to make you see why Travers is so against what the Studio wants to do.

The turning point comes when Ralph (Paul Giamatti), her driver, the only person she hasn't been able to annoy, connects with her in a way to make her re-think about where she is and the people she's dealing with. (I have to say, this scene could have been trite and contrived, but Giamatti and Thompson are brilliant in it.)

Now, I'm really not sure how much of this movie is fact and how much is fudged fact, it is after all, a movie, and doesn't claim to be a historical document. For instance, the way A Spoonful Of Sugar came about is different than how the Sherman's tell the story. Some of it is pretty accurate, like the way Travers complained about everything, since Disney still has the recordings. After one song, Walt remarks, ""That'll work."", his highest praise he ever gave the Sherman Brothers, but it wasn't after Feed the Birds. (It was, however, a nice touch to include Walt's favorite song at his lowest point dealing with Travers.)

Regardless, this is a terrific film. Every Walter Elias Disney and/or Mary Poppins fan should see it. Just remember it's not a G-rated film, and probably wouldn't recommend it for kids. (It's PG-13, which for a Disney branded movie is pretty rare. Yes, movies like the Pirates franchise was rated PG-13, but like Saving Mr. Banks, by its very nature should be a Disney Movie.) While the 1961 timeline has some laugh out loud moments, much of the 1906 timeline is pretty dark.

Dick Sherman was an active consultant, which is probably one of the reasons why the movie seems so authentic. He is, after all, the last person still living who was in that room during those two weeks, over 50 years ago.

I'd also like to address some common misperceptions I've seen, mostly because of the trailer. Don't judge the movie by the trailer. The trailer really doesn't misrepresent, but it hardly touches on a very large aspect of the movie. I understand why it was done that way, but it's very easy to misperceive what the movie is about.

First, (and most important) it is not a movie about Walt Disney. Second, it is not Mary Poppins, nor the making of Mary Poppins.

It is about Walt attempting to secure the rights to Mary Poppins during Pamela Travers' two-week visit to the Burbank studios in 1961, and the reasons why Pamela Travers is so protective of Mary and Mr. Banks.

I also have to say that Hanks might not look a whole lot like Walt, but by the end of the movie he had me convinced he was Walt. After watching his performance, I decided I'd rather have an actor that can act like Walt than an actor that looks like Walt but can't act like Walt, and Hanks does a fantastic and credible job. And let's face it, Emma Thompson doesn't look like Travers, nor do the Sherman Brothers' or Don DaGradi's counterparts. But make the actors look superficially like them, and the performances are so good that you'll buy it. At least I did. (And from interviews, so did Karen Dotrice (who played Jane Banks in the original film) and Dick Sherman, who insist that Hanks' mannerisms and speech are very much like Walt's.)

Finally, I would add that if you haven't seen Mary Poppins recently, you might want to boot the DVD (or Blu-Ray, just released), and watch the movie. I'd also watch the segments about the making of the movie in the video ""the boys, the sherman brothers' story."" It's not strictly necessary, but it'll provide some background of a few things that just are in the movie without explanation, and there are some details that might otherwise be missed in Saving Mr. Banks.

Anyway, there's a pretty good chance I'll actually go to a theater to see the movie again during its general release to see the other little things I missed. If you know me, that's some high praise...",1386288000,5,5741,4.543078412391094
5593170,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Doesn't Tom Hanks ever just sit down and relax? After the grueling ""Captain Phillips,"" what does he do for an encore? He gives us Walt Disney (with a regulation mustache) during the time he clashes with P.L. Travers, the feisty woman who wrote ""Mary Poppins."" (I never heard about that, did you? Evidently this battle was waged over a 20-year period, as their respective fortunes waxed and waned.)

The doughty author is an unbending, sharp-tongued shrew who flings insults with arrogant abandon but expects to be treated with deference and respect. ""I am Mrs. Travers, NOT Pamela!"" She intimidates everyone she encounters, ignores contracts and marches out of meetings without compunction. The pears in her complimentary fruit basket at the Beverly Hills hotel are lobbed off the balcony. Her outrageous demands are legendary: ""There will be no RED in this film!""

We follow:
  * Tom Hanks (""Cloud Atlas"") as Walt Disney, beset by a cantankerous dame who will not trust him to do justice to her beloved character. It takes his insight and shared memories of mutually unlovable fathers that allows him to finally make a tiny dent in her armor.
  * Emma Thompson (""Nanny McPhee"") is P.L. Travers who swears she will make sure her creation is treated with respect. To her, Disney is the personification of a Hollywood machine that will maul her magical nanny beyond recognition. (He first proposed an animated version.)
  * Annie Rose Buckley (""Home and Away"") is Ginty, the name her doting father called our author when she was a child in Australia. We see numerous flashbacks that illustrate her hardscrabble childhood.
  * Colin Farrell (""Dead Man Down"") is Travers Goff, her beloved banker father who colors her childhood with his affection and his drunkenness. Farrell continues to dazzle me with his range and skill! He even makes his drunken character lovable.
  * Ruth Wilson (""Luther"") is Margaret, our author's long-suffering mother, living at the lonely end of the railroad line in Australia.
  * Rachel Griffiths (""Brothers & Sisters"") is Aunt Ellie, umbrella and bottomless carpetbag in hand, come to that miserable house to help the struggling family. The moment we see her rigid silhouette at the front door, we KNOW who inspired Mary Poppins!
  * Paul Giamatti (""Romeo and Juliet"") is Ralph, the first American to face Travers' withering scorn; he is her limo driver. She isn't impressed by California; when she sniffs the air, he tells her she is smelling jasmine, she thinks it ""smells of sweat!""

""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" is hidden from Mrs. Travers because she won't tolerate nonsense. Disney's talented but thoroughly cowed songwriters (played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) are out-witted, out-foxed and out-maneuvered by this wily, determined, and exasperating woman.

The screening audience often laughed at her acerbic (PG-13) wit. Me, not so much; I missed a lot because I couldn't hear it. I found myself longing for closed captions; I know I'll love my DVD when it becomes available on Amazon.

Oh! Mr. Banks is the children's father in ""Mary Poppins."" He's a banker. Did you remember that?",1386288000,15,3134,5.109803921568627
5593171,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I spent the majority of the movie in tears. A simultaneously sorrowful and joyful film about the power of story to inspire hope, heal pain, and bring redemption. I absolutely loved it, and as an actor, it reminded me why we go to all this trouble to make movies - so that we can love each other through them. Emma Thompson as PL Travers is practically perfect in every way, and Tom Hanks and the supporting cast are delightful. It's sentimental, but it was a sentiment I needed.",1386201600,4,478,4.443181818181818
5593172,4,B00BEIYSL4,"SAVING MR. BANKS tells the story of when author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) went to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) about negotiating the film rights to MARY POPPINS.  As she negotiates - often fruitlessly - with Disney's creative team, her mind flashes back to her childhood in Australia.  Through such flashbacks we learn the extent to which MARY POPPINS is based on her autobiographical experiences.  Thompson's performance is a memorable one; her reactions to Disney's idealized world are classic, especially when she repeats the words ""No! No! No!"" in tones that recall Margaret Rutherford.  She is also vulnerable in an alien world, which pushes her towards a friendship with her driver Ralph (Paul Giametti).  Hanks' Disney comes across as an avuncular personality with a penchant for getting what he wants, but not without a considerable degree of understanding.  The portrait is an idealized one (apparently Disney was much more ruthless, and did not really get on with Travers at all), but works well within the overall film.  There are sentimental moments, but the ending is particularly affecting, when the film juxtaposes clips from the 1964 version of MARY POPPINS with Travers' and Disney's reaction, as they watch the premiere in Hollywood.",1385769600,7,1278,5.204878048780488

My favorite 'Walt' quote from the movie, as told to the hyper protective author of Mary Poppins once he understood her backstory:

'George Banks will be honored. George Banks will be redeemed. George Banks and all that he stands for will be saved.

Maybe not in life, but in imagination.
Because that's what storytellers do.
We restore order with imagination. We instill hope again and again and again.'

5593842,4,B00BEIYSL4,"The process of studio filmmaking is politics with a profound sense of desire and passion. Anyone could view these politics as a silly farce, especially when creating something fictional and fake. Yet with art in the blood  it has a sadistic and unhealthy bind to the narrators and storytellers themselves including you Walt. The ultimate studio mogul with all the spectacle of the magic kingdom cannot remain content without the work of P.L. Travers on his resume. Yet even under the agreement of collaborative terms, the demands of Disney (the producer and the ultimate auteur?) must be met in his own adaptation of her books. Yet Saving Mr. Banks, as do the films Hitchcock (2012); White Hunter, Black Heart (1990);and Hugo (2011)  showcase the deeply personal conundrum of life as the source where our beloved movies originate. Travers remains a poignant example of this, as she views her own fictional character as not just a reflection her youth, but a pseudo-solution to her struggles. Her opposition to Disneys animated sequence is praiseworthy as its the single element that hinders Mary Poppins (1964) the ability to withstand being truly watchable in the eyes of the contemporary culture.",1514419200,,1198,5.107142857142857

The audience is supposed to slowly begin to sympathize with her as more of the ""justifications"" for her nastiness are revealed, but the screenplay takes much too long to get to any point where you would even want to like her. The ending is hokey and apparently untrue as to the emotions and motivations involved.

If you think you might be interested in this movie because you liked the Disney movie Mary Poppins, you should stay away and hold on to your memories. If you like the female lead, you will end up despising her. If you like the male lead, you will find nothing in this movie to bolster your opinion.

At the end of the movie when the writer was supposed to have a soft heart, as they say that's what dreams are made of.

Without giving too much away, this movie is the true story of how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) acquired the rights to make the book into a movie musical.

5594504,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I feel a little cheated that this movie showed P.L.Travers being won over by Mary Poppins. The real story is she hated it. And the things she hated about the movie are the same things that make it a fairly bad movie. Yes I know generations loved it etc but remember the extended penguin dance scene, the carousel, the exhausting overacting elder bank manager? The weird neighbors shooting fireworks? The original Mary Poppins needed more P.L. Travers and less Disney, and more respect for their audience. This was a fairly enjoyable movie, but it erased history.

5594580,5,B00BEIYSL4,"It took me two times of watching this movie to really appreciate what it is about.  Its not about the making of an iconic Disney movie (Mary Poppins).  Its not about how a curmudgeon is controlling about releasing her book to become a movie.  Watch closely, because the movie is about connection and empathy.  Its about the art of understanding people.  The crux of the film is how Mr. Disney seeks to understand P. L. Travers and the motivation for her resistance to making the movie.  In so doing he displays a very high degree of emotional intelligence, because he figured out what was driving her fears (her trauma from her fathers alcoholism which unfolds throughout the movie), and he flew across the pond to relate to it by sharing his own trauma (being buried in the snow drifts that were taller than him while delivering newspapers twice daily as a child).  Unlocking, connecting, and empathizing with someones greatest pain is a lesson in people skills for us all.  Of course, we don't know for certain if that exchange between these two individuals actually occurred.  In fact, many accounts suggest that Walt Disney was quite unempathic and a bit of a dictator at work.  However, it was a beautiful and poignant story nonetheless.  Its well told and a definite must watch film.",1487548800,,1289,4.761261261261262

Of course, I am old enough to have been a child for the theatrical release of ""Mary Poppins"". (Same here e'en then re: DvanD.)
If you step back and take a look at the larger context, as the masterful montage invites us to do, we see that the creative artistic impulse in society is often born of hardship or even malformation.

Great storytelling happens when you portray a character as nearly unbearable, and properly transition them into a completely likable, yet realistic frame -- meaning, Mrs. Travers. That is one of my favorite things about this movie: the pace at which her layers are uncovered.

Moreover, to see how every character in Mary Poppins came to life, and even the combination of real life people int he life of Mrs. Travers who inspired one same character, was very heartwarming. I loved how Mrs. Travers seems so stubborn as an adult while we look at her as an adult, and yet when we accept the invitation to see the same but through the child within her and her experiences, that stubbornness is then the most beautiful loyalty, the most genuine desire to preserve the integrity of these characters, these people who meant the world to her. I loved Mrs. Travers' own human process in the midst of creating Mary Poppins, and what Walt Disney, the man, invited her to uncover and make peace with. And of course, how could any of it go wrong when you get to listen to bits and pieces of songs from the movie Mary Poppins?! Just wonderful!",1478563200,,1226,4.645161290322581

5595188,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Delightful film and interesting to see the evolution of a film classic that almost didn't happen.  Naturally, Hanks and Thompson nail their roles. Thompson's character is complicated and layered.  An added joy is the brief, but charming background vignettes with Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson that help lay the foundation of the story.  Cinematography is also well done in this picture, as is the costume design, which bounces between timelines.",1478390400,,445,5.328571428571428

5595308,4,B00BEIYSL4,"""Mary Poppins"" is truly a solid five star film that transports the viewer to a mythical, magical version of London set in a simpler time. It is the ultimate Disney film, capturing the optimism and spirit of ""Happily Ever After"" which re-ignites the sense of wonder we had as children. If one attempts a so-called ""social justice warrior"" analysis of this film, you will come up short and miss the entire point of this wonderful, entertaining film. That point is making the best of even the worst of circumstances life can dish out and choosing to be happy in spite of the difficulties.

In ""Saving Mr. Banks"" Tom Hanks does an admirable job breathing life into the lines he was given. Mr. Hanks performance however lacks Walt Disney's often mercurial nature and his capricious changes in mood which kept Disney Company employees on edge. (Following the 1941 strike by animators and staff, Disney's relationship with his employees became adversarial and distant.) Hank's makeup may seem like a quibble, but seeing Tom Hanks with orange skin surrounded by people of normal coloring was quite a distraction. Emma Thompson did a wonderful job portraying P. L. Travers, the author of the ""Mary Poppins"" series of books. Her performance was so good, it will bring you to tears. It is a must see film about the making of the film ""Mary Poppins"". 3 stars",1475971200,,1346,4.8268398268398265

5595366,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I wouldn't ever rank this as one of my ""favorite movies"", but I do find myself watching it over and over again. We all have a back story and we all have things that we clasp onto so tightly. Few people know (ourselves included) why we do such things, but this is a fascinating look into one woman's story.

I love the acting and think the casting is phenomenal, particularly the production staff characters (Schwartzman, Novak, Whitford, and the young assistant- she was such a delight!) and of course, Emma Thompson and Paul Giamatti. It was also a nice change for me to see Colin Farrell in such a tender role. He has been the action hero for so long, but he has so warm and loving that your heart breaks as you watch his story.

The one exception I have (and this hurts me to say) is Tom Hanks. I love him just as much as every other American female, but I couldn't get past him being ""Tom Hanks"" to really believe him as Walt Disney.

I love history and, as a former film student, I love backstories on films that I love. This one fits the bill and then some!",1474761600,,1063,4.252475247524752

5595473,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I knew that this wasn't a great film (despite it's cast) going into it. I thought it would be just okay and it pretty much was. Since it wasn't a documentary, I wasn't *too* put off by the changes that were made. I thought it was kind of neat that those who wrote the Mary Poppins movie actually seemed to take inspiration from the author herself as much as from the books the author wrote.

I don't know how I feel about how many lines they incorporated from Mary Poppins into SMR as things other people actually said. Cute easter eggs for those who know the movie well, but a little over the top.

On the whole, in fact, it's fairly depressing. The scenes that take place in Australia are...well, they aren't for kids.

On an unrelated note, my big disappointment is that we didn't see much of the person that actually inspired Mary Poppins. That is really why I wanted to see the movie.",1473638400,,889,4.375757575757576

Travers to give him movie rights to ""Mary Poppins.""  The story moves back and forth in time, from insights into Travers' past to development of the blockbuster movie musical. In my opinion, it's best suited for older kids and adults, as it's sometimes too tragic, sensitive, slow,and intense for kids younger than 12. As a writer, I found it utterly compelling.",1471996800,,613,4.894230769230769

It is interesting to see the early thoughts that the Disney employees had during development of a movie that is so familiar to me. Tom Hanks played Walt Disney well, too. My only reservation with this movie is that by all accounts I've seen Travers was essentially bullied into agreeing to Disney's interpretation of her material. I realize this is par for the course when you sign over rights to your work, however it might have been nice to see something a bit more based in fact. However, being that this, too, is a Disney movie, it's understandable that they would cast their studio in a better light.",1471910400,,715,4.728

5595938,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Wasn't fully the film I was expecting. Really an opposite of what the trailer for the film led me to believe. In short it shows the author of Marry Poppins to be highly autistic. Her tantrums are the bulk of the film and even after seeing her backstory make it difficult to relate to her. On the other side Walt Disney is portrayed in a more positive bias. Spoiler alert  they eventually make the movie about Marry Poppins. The movie really tried a few times to make it seem like that film wasn't going to be made, but hindsight is 20/20, it felt like they could have had better padding for drama than the movie not getting made, because we should all know at this point it was made.",1468108800,,683,4.294573643410852

I'm assuming the Paul Giammati character is as invented as he seems but I haven't researched that. Disney Disney Disney. If this wasn't about real people I would have liked it better, but I think it probable that Travers would have seen this as not only inaccurate but a perverse and deep insult and that makes me view it much more unfavorably than I might have otherwise.",1465689600,,513,4.908045977011494

5596210,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Well, there are not many people I know who don't like the film 'Mary Poppins'. So why not see how and where it all began by watching one of the most incredible films of last year, 'Saving Mr Banks'. Starring Tom Hanks as movie maker Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as writer P.L.Travers, author of the Mary Poppins books, this stunning movie tells of the meetings between Walt Disney and P.L.Travers and his determination to obtain the screen rights to her books to make the film we all know and love today.
Tom Hanks is, of course, superb as Walt Disney but Emma Thompson gives, in my opinion, one of the best performances of her career as the stubborn author.
The film is made by the Disney company so, although it is based on reality, it has been given the Disney sentimenatitly and sweetness that wasn't actually there in truth. The movie ends following the premier of Mary Poppins and sees P.L.Travers crying, the viewer is given the impression that it is because of her recalling her relationship with her father, but in truth the real P.L.Travers was seen crying at the premier but it was due to her actual hatred of the film, the musical numbers and mostly of the animation, of which she was steadfast should never be used. Keep watching the credits as the director has very cleverly included clips of the original tape recordings of the meetings and you can hear the real P.L.Travers making her feelings known.
Given the differences between reality and the various fictionalised scenes this film is a definite 'must see' and I join the many critics who feel that it should have been given more accolades at the Oscars",1465430400,,1624,4.642361111111111

5596526,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I wanted to like this movie but alas, Tom Hanks was not a credible Walt Disney. My family watched his program weekly when I was growing up and so many things about Hanks did not jibe--voice, personality and mannerisms. He made an effort, but fell short.
The scenes from P.L. Travers' childhood had an almost dreamlike quality that attempted to provide backstory but was woefully inadequate. Close-ups of her as a child had a worshipful quality that was annoying, and depictions of her alcoholic father's irresponsible flights of fancy were a gauzy romantic view of the tragic circumstance of children growing up with a father having fallen prey to his addiction to alcohol. All these scenes had a disjointed quality. Maybe it was intentional--perhaps the film maker wants us to feel the chaos and unrealized sense of loss that Travers felt as her childhood was characterized by events out of her control. This seems to explain her near-maniacal and illogical control over the script with regard to the Mary Poppins character.
For a larger-than-life person like Walt Disney, I think a documentary rich with interviews, pictures, film clips and narrative would be much better to treat the subject matter. I realize this was mainly P.L. Travers' story as it relates to her negotiations with Disney, but I would have enjoyed a documentary treatment of this subject better--uncharted territory with regard to serious movie-making. Truth a lot of times is stranger--and much more engaging--than fictionalized accounts. I visited Hollywood Studios theme park in Orlando last year and went through the museum having to do with Walt Disney's life. It was packed with people pouring over every piece of his life--early drawings and photos, a childhood desk, all the furniture from his office in California; the interest and excitement was palpable.  Documentaries are an overlooked aspect of filmmaking that is largely relegated to public broadcasting channels. If story telling was done better by Hollywood, as in days gone by, I wouldn't have minded this movie as is, but it leaves something to be desired.  Probably deserved two stars but I gave it three just because it tried--like the little engine that could.",1461715200,3,2205,5.122222222222222

5596653,2,B00BEIYSL4,"I seem to be in the minority here but REALLY did not like this movie. It is promoted in previews as a light hearted comedy. It most definitely is not. It's really quite dark and depressing. Hanks does an amazing job pulling off a Walt Disney impersonation but that's about the only thing good I can say about this movie. Far too much time is wasted on long agonizing and depressing childhood of the author of the Mary Poppins book. It just goes on and on and on and I really hated the continuous jumping back and forth between the 1960s and the author's dark childhood. I also grew increasingly annoyed with this clearly crazy woman, almost to the point of turning off the movie. Those who reported hearing weeping in the theater were probably hearing those in misery after realizing they wasted their money on this ill conceived bit of ""entertainment.""

5596772,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I could praise the film for pages and pages. To best appreciate it, the viewer should be very familiar with the Disney film/musical Mary Poppins. The film interweaves the biography of P.L. Traverse with the process of Disney's later efforts to persuade her to let him create one film musical based on her books about Mary Poppins' mission with the Banks family. From what I have heard, the biographical information of Traverse is meager but heart-wrenching. I have been meaning to look up the information on her life, but I have not done it yet. So I don't know how much of the book is artistic freedom  None the less, the film flows so skillfully it's worth watching regardless of how much actual biographical material is based on fact.

The acting is supreme. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson head an excellent ensemble cast. The direction is outstanding; the filming is magnificent and the screenplay and editing, top notch.  It plays as an almost mystery-drama on several levels. Even though we know that Traverse eventually sold Disney the rights to the story, when I watch the film-- and I've seen it at least 10 times-- I always feel the suspense that she is not going to allow the production. Each time I see even a part of this movie on a no-commercial channel on tv, I become so immersed it's almost impossible to stop watching. I had to have the DVD in my film library. Although I'm not able to name directors off the top of my head, I am a movie buff. I was born in the late 1950s, and this film is in my top 20.",1457049600,,1519,4.4765342960288805

5596815,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Being a huge Disney fan I had high expectations for this movie and was not disappointed.  I never realized it took so many years to get Mary Poppins made but the movie tells that story beautifully.  Even for those who aren't Disney fans like me, it is worth seeing anyway as it deals with matters of the heart and shows that the way we treat other people can affect others (positively or negatively) more than we realize.

Needless, to say, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish the first and second time I watched it. Well-acted. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson put on a great performance portraying Walt Disney and P. L. Travers respectively. I enjoyed watching the dynamic and development between the two throughout the movie. Furthermore, I'm sure everyone enjoys coherence when it comes to story telling.

It IS, somewhat, an interesting tale of Disney wooing, or trying to woo, the writer of Mary Poppins.
She fights the idea of 'Hollywood' or' Disneyfying' her beloved book.
I liked seeing the song writers work and the actors do a decent job. It is always hard not to like
Emma Thompson. Hanks is a given, though I never pictured him as Walt.

5597253,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Loved this movie.  It's based on Walt Disney's two decades of attempts to get P.L. Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins books, to allow him to make a movie based on her characters.  The story of the reluctant writer is told with flashbacks to her own childhood interwoven with her reluctance and dismay that the characters might not be treated properly.

Mrs. Travers' father is shown as the eternal optimist, living in a dream world of his own making, always telling his children that life is magical even as they move to worse living circumstances.  Much of the movie is spent with her trying to come to terms with this, which she apparently attempted to do with her writing.  Knowing Mary Poppins only through the Disney movie, I don't know how else this played out Travers' books but it makes up enough of the movie that one has to believe it was a significant force for her.

I'm sure there was poetic license taken with some of the details, but I found it enchanting.",1452556800,,976,4.548571428571429

This is not at all what it is. It has humor, but it's an emotionally wrenching and very beautiful story about a person who suffered from her beloved father's alcoholism. It has a spectacular cast, really really great acting, strong pacing, just the right amount of humor to balance the sorrow, and tremendous beauty. I highly recommend, but keep the tissues handy. And although the movie has nothing inappropriate as far as sex and violence, there are things that might be emotionally troubling to children (family trauma, death).

5597570,3,B00BEIYSL4,"First of all, there is no fantastic content whatsoever, but the subject matter is certain to be of interest to fans of P.L. Travers or Disney.

Secondly, I watched Night and Day (Cole Porter's biopic) a couple of weeks ago, and even as I was watching it I was aware that the movie could not possibly be accurate. There are too many little details that fail to explain themselves or provide dramatic insight into the character, but are there due to the fact that they are based on someone's life events. For example Porter and his wife lived separate lives for the most part, but the movie fails to put the finger on the true reason: Porter was of homosexual orientation.
While the movie remains an entertaining Hollywood myth, it utterly fails as a historical biography document.

If you go into Saving Mr. Banks with this sort of awareness, you will see an OK film.
If however you think you will get genuine insight on any one character you will be sadly disappointed. While it is true that Traver's and Disney's dealing and the result were rocky and unsatisfying the movie fails to convince in either a dramatic or historically accurate manner the reason why Travers would agree to give Disney the rights to the Mary Poppins character. She resists too much (with genuinely valid reasons), accedes too quickly apparently based on a single song, ultimately leaves California when she figures out animation is involved, but then signs the contract upon a late London visit with Disney's final pitch.

I think the story would work better if she accepted merely due to economic reasons (move the discussion with her agent from the beginning of the movie to after her return to London.) She should sign the Disney contract even while clearly having reservations, and then have it proven to be the right thing to do at the premier. This is not be historically correct, but I think it works better as drama and within the emotional context as presented.

I also had some reservations regarding anachronistic costuming and plush dolls, but they are not that really a big deal as they are such a small part of the movie. There are also a couple of easily fixed anachronisms at the park. It'd be nice if they were correct, but it's no biggie.

5597629,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This is an understated mystery: not a who-done-it; more a why-can't-I-have-it.  The reasons Walt Disney has had to court the writer of Mary Poppins, P. L. Travers, for twenty years for the rights to her work are complex, emotional and intimately tied to tragedy in the writer's past.  The story unfolds through Disney's and Travers' wrangling in the early 1960's and in flashbacks from Travers' childhood as painful memories emerge during preliminary work on the movie.  The unfolding story is well paced and compelling and the settings are unexpected and interesting.  I thought the cast, director and the movie staff did a fine job.  I had just a little trouble getting into the movie because I didn't care for the movie Mary Poppins, but the characters who actually lived the story cared intensely and their story is a good one.",1447632000,,831,4.9071428571428575

5597999,5,B00BEIYSL4,"The circumstances that inspired Mary Poppins were personal ones for P.L. Travers and Walt Disney's efforts to bring the film to screen unravelled the novel's true beginnings in rural Australia. To know P.L. Travers was born and grew up in Australia came as a pleasant surprise given the narrative for Mary Poppins took place in England. Disney was persistent but he also appreciated the deep connection the author had to the book and characters, which helped him build a rapport with Travers. The movie provides rare and humorous insights to how Mary Poppins was adapted to a motion picture.

5598241,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Three and a half stars.  I probably would have rated this higher had I not been somewhat familiar with the back story.  The movie does have some wonderfully watchable moments, but I doubt if one speck of ""feel good"" transpired in reality.  Disney, delightfully played by Hanks, wasn't nearly so charitable toward Travers once he got her signature on that contract.  (This was lightly touched upon in the film when he failed to invite Travers to the premiere. In actual events, when she did show up, Disney snubbed her the entire time.)  And the real Travers probably wasn't nearly as emotionally yielding in the end as Thompson portrays her.  I love Emma Thompson's work, and she did a fine job, but I couldn't help but think that Brenda Blethyn would have been a better choice, given her physical similarities to that famous author and her ability to portray stern, cold, wounded women.  (I think they were going for the bigger box-office draw with Thompson.)  One ridiculous scene when Travers' studio-supplied driver (Paul Giamatti) opens up about his physically-challenged daughter.  He tells Travers that he pays so much attention to the weather because when it's sunny, his daughter can go outside, but if it's raining, she has to stay indoors.  Well, duh. Same for most kids everywhere.

In short, this is a Disneyized film about the making of a Disneyized film.  A tiny bit of realism with copious spoons full of sugar. And I doubt very much if Travers would have approved.",1443571200,,1481,4.856573705179283

First, you will not find more perfect casting in any other movie. This movie told the backstory behind the making of Mary Poppins, and the writing of it - which was so touching and so Classic. I thought a lot about Walt Disney - whether all great societies have their own ""Disneys"" - visionaries who give us hope, and Magic, and who embrace The Possible. I thought about Creativity, Childhood and Family. I really MUST read more about Disney AND P. L. Travers.
Oh, BTW -- The writer's attempt to imply that Disney - such a singular genius - was 'diagnosable' in some way - Nothing could be more absurd or silly - that's a ""Hollywood thing"" and easily ignored.",1441497600,,680,4.536585365853658

Well this film is that story and, as far I have read, a fairly accurate rendering of the real story behind Mary Poppins, maybe the most beloved of all of Walt Disney's films, and the film that took Julie Andrews to international stardom followed up by The Sound of Music.  As I've gotten older, Mary Poppins is the film I appreciate more.  To have an idea of the angst that was behind it, makes perfect sense to me, and why I enjoy it so much.  And this film is enjoyable in a different way.  Even if not COMPLETELY accurate, it still makes for a great story of our greatest pains becoming our greatest blessings to share with the world if we will let them.  In the end, don't we all, at any age, want a Mary Poppins to fly in and clean up our messes a little bit?  Maybe Walt, as portrayed in this film, was able to do that for Ms. Travers in the end.",1439337600,,1019,4.216494845360825

Great sets and costumes, fine performances (especially by Paul Giamatti in a small but thoughtful part), but even the backstory presented for Travers could not make her more likable.

5598777,5,B00BEIYSL4,"his particular movie never interested me very much when it was first released. I had this on my dvd list and I kept on avoiding it for some reason or the other. A film about Disney's effort to convince P.L. Travers, the author to give permission for the movie version of her book Mary Poppins.
I am so overwhelmed after watching this film that I can only say that this was one of the few movies that I have seen in recent times that engulfed me, and touched me emotionally. It made me teary eyed and emotional watching the life of the author, whose own childhood influenced the book Mary Poppins.
The movie is about a dogged Walt trying to recover the rights to Mary Poppins for a cinematic adaptation. Travers has been rejecting the movie for years and only reluctantly agrees to meet for a meeting to see what the possibilities are and to first hand see the pre production work completed. However the meeting does not go as planned because Travers find everything wrong with the adaptation.
She is determined that this project would not be a reality but so is Walt, who is  hell bent on making true of his promise to his daughters that he would one day bring Mary Poppins to life. As the talks breakdown and Travers leaves for England, Disney realises that everything that he has understood of the Mary Poppins book and the author is wrong.
Emma Thompson as Travers is spellbinding. She is a hard, insensitive and cold women who frowns upon any niceties. She gives a lesson in acting. Then there is Hanks, one of the most gifted actors in the world, a low key portrayal of Disney. But this is what Hanks does best, bringing with him a warmth and common man quality that is so down earth. He was the perfect choice for this film, In Fact I don't think anyone could have played this role with so much dignity and warmth. If you want to see what I mean, watch the scene when he remembers his own childhood as a newspaper delivery boy.  The rest of the cast is phenomenal and no one seems out of sorts. Colin Farrell as Travers father is phenomenal...So was Paul Giametti as the chauffeur who drivers Travers around in Hollywood.
Saving Mr. Banks is a phenomenal movie that examines childhood memories, loss and love for our parents. It is also an examination about life that sometimes we have to let go of our past to embrace the future.
This will be a movie that I will be watching again soon. I regret that I was not able to see it at the movies. Release date: Dec 20th, 2013.",1436140800,2,2477,4.4179431072210065

5598798,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Two of the names that get my attention, the magic of childhood movie-making
'Walt Disney' and one of todays finest actors 'Tom Hanks'
The film is the true story of how the film 'Mary Poppins' came about.
The author 'P.L.Travers' (Emma Thompson) is down on her uppers, she's almost
broke, she's not written a book for some time, the royalties are no longer paying
for her life-style.
'Walt Disney' (Tom Hanks) wants to adapt her book 'Mary Poppins' into a movie,
to do so he has to have her permission to go ahead.
She takes a flight to L.A to reluctantly discuss his proposals, on arrival her hotel
room is stacked out with Disney Characters (toys and puppets).with the courtesy
of 'Walt'.............She is not amused.
'Walt' has pursued his dream to turn the book into a film for twenty years having
promised his then young daughter he would do so.
'Pamela' has agreed to listen to the proposals 'Walt' and his team have though
she is in no mood to make compromises, and will not be easily impressed.
Every thing suggested early on is rejected out of hand by 'Pamela' she even has
a thing about the colour 'red' and will not discuss any form of animation.
'Walt' and his team become frustrated as every idea is knocked back, the situation
looks seemingly impossible, but 'Walt' isn't about to give up, he wants her signature
on the contract.
'Pamela' apparently like 'Walt' have ghosts from the past, she often reflects on events
that shaped her life during childhood, yet, it had inspired her in the writing of the book
'Mary Poppins'
'Walt' has to find a way to understand the lady to achieve his ambition with her blessing
to go ahead and create the story they both want.
There are many amusing confrontations between 'Walt' and his team with 'Pamela'
The film, sometimes very funny, often touching and deeply moving, a tale that will
almost certainly draw you in whether you like the film 'Mary Poppins' or not, the film
which is 'the making of 'Mary Poppins' is quite simply ....a must see.
A DELIGHTFUL FILM.
Great performances throughout with superb picture and sound quality.
Special Features:
* Deleted Scenes - 'Stargaze' - 'Nanny Song' - 'Pam leaves'
* Behind the scenes - 'The Disney studios-from 'Mary Poppins' to present.
* Behind the scenes: - Let's Go Fly a Kite.",1435536000,,2281,4.705

Travers felt that Disney had taken advantage of her and was so bitter about the cavalier way he treated her she refused to work with him or any American producer again.,1435449600,,371,4.522388059701493

5598868,4,B00BEIYSL4,"As a DisNerd, I'd have mixed reactions to Saving Mr. Banks from the moment I heard about it.  I'd already known much of the story behind the work Walt Disney went through to get the rights to Mary Poppins.  And honestly, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about watching an actor, any actor, play Disney.  Plus how would P. L. Travers come across?  Then I started hearing raves for it, so I finally got a chance to rent it.  It was good, but I do have some issues with it.

When Walt Disney's (Tom Hanks) girls were little, they found the Mary Poppins books by P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson).  They convinced him that the stories would make a great movie.  However, Mrs. Travers was against the idea.  She loved the characters and didn't want to see them turned into chirping cartoons.

It took 20 years for Mrs. Travers to even agree to meet with Walt Disney, and this movie follows that trip and what it took for her to finally give over the rights to her beloved characters.  She objected to everything.  How the house would look.  The songs.  Oh the songs.  The color red being in the film.

As this story unfolds, we see flashbacks to her days growing up in Australia and her relationship with her own parents (Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson).  How does that affect her feelings for the characters?

Honestly, part of the reason I was worried is that Disney would come across as the hero and Mrs. Travers as the villain.  And she certain did come across as unreasonable, especially at the beginning.  However, as the movie unfolded, she became a very sympathetic character.  It was not the hatchet job on her I had feared.  In fact, I quite grew to like her.

My other issue going in was watching Tom Hanks play Walt Disney.  Honestly, I never quite got over this.  I'm not saying his acting was bad; in fact, from what I've heard, he was outstanding in the part.  But he's not Disney, and it just never felt like anything other than an actor playing Walt Disney to me.  Yes, I fully understand that this is the DisNerd in me coming out, but I can't help it.

The acting was uniformly amazing.  Even though I could never forget it was Tom Hanks, I thought he was good.  I completely bought Emma Thompson as Mrs. Travers.  From the rest of the 1960's cast, my favorite was Paul Giamatti who played Mrs. Travers's driver.  The cast of the flashback sequences were quite good as well, especially Annie Rose Buckley who played the author as a girl.

Everyone I've talked to about the film talked about how moving the ending was and about how I'd need tissue.  Considering I cry in movies at the drop of a hat, I took that warning seriously.  Maybe it was because I was expecting it, but while I was certainly moved by what I saw, I didn't really cry.

Then again, maybe it was because of my issues with the film.  Let's start with my DisNerd nit picks.  There is a scene in the film set and filmed at Disneyland.  While I'd never been to Disneyland in 1961, I've seen enough pictures to know it was fake.  Oh, they filmed it at Disneyland, but that was the problem.  Too many changes to the park have been made since the 1960's, most noticeably the new Fantasyland.  Then, during the screening of the film that constitutes the climax, it they had a scene from Mary Poppins out of order.  It fit the dramatic arc they needed, but it bugged me.

On their own, those two issues wouldn't have been enough ruin the film.  I'd point them out and move on.  But there's the fact that the climax of the movie is a completely and total lie.  I knew much of the story portrayed in the film already, and I know how it really ends.  I get why they did what they did - it is much better thematically and dramatically.  However, it still bugs me and makes me wonder what else was made up for dramatic purposes.  Honestly, this may be one reason I wasn't as moved by the ending as I expected to be - I knew I was being manipulated, and that kind of thing always bugs me.

I realize I'm sounding harsh at this point.  Please don't misunderstand - the movie is good and worth seeing.  It's just my desire to correct things that are making me sound pretty forceful here.

The movie is rated PG-13, and parents should take that to heart.  There is a smattering of language and some pretty rough scenes.  It may be about a beloved film for all ages, but this is definitely aimed at adults.

So yes, I am glad I watched Saving Mr. Banks.  However, the ending, which most everyone else loved, keeps me from giving it a unreserved recommendation.",1434412800,,4524,4.362545018007203
5598869,5,B00BEIYSL4,"SAVING MR. BANKS is a biography about PL Travers, starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks.  The film concerns events taking place during one year in the childhood of PL Travers (location: Australia), and events taking place over the course of a month in the year 1961 (location: London and Los Angeles).  The film is not what you expect.  The real topic of this biography, are the psychological problems of PL Travers.  She is uptight, irrational, arrogant, and obsessively rude.  Other terms that are familiar to the layperson, and also to those with professional training in psychiatric diseases and mental illnesses, will also come to mind.

OPENING MOMENTS.  The opening moments show a country scene in Australia, and words on the screen read, ""1906 MARYBOROUGH, AUSTRALIA.""  A male narrator says, ""Winds in the east, mist coming in like something is brewing about to begin, can't put my finger on what lies in store.""  We see PL Travers as a little girl, sitting in a garden with her eyes closed.  Then, the film makes a segue, and we see Travers as a middle-aged woman with her eyes closed.  She is in her apartment in London, and she is at her desk where she drafts her Mary Poppins stories.  Her literary agent is arriving, with the goal of managing PL Travers through the contract signing procedure, for providing Disney studios with the film rights to the story.

ELEGANCE AND ARROGANCE.  A continuing theme in this movie is the elegance and arrogance of PL Travers.  The elegance is literary elegance in her ability to dream up images suitable for childrens' stories, and the arrogance is PL Travers' behaviors towards everybody, including towards her literary agent, passengers on an airplane, limo drivers, script writers, and everybody else.  Shortly after the agent arrives at her apartment, PL Travers looks out her window at the London street, where a cherry tree is in bloom, and she remarks to herself, ""LIKE PINK CLOUDS ON STICKS.""

FIRST FLASHBACK.  We see PL Travers as a ten year old in the garden at her home in Australia.  Her father is a handsome banker in his mid-thirties.  He pretends not to recognize his daughter, and he rambles about his garden and says, ""Eh-hmm, eh-hmmm, excuse me ma'am, have you seen my daughter?  I was quite sure I left her around here.  Here name is Helen, I mean Shirley . . . could it be Prunella?""  The girls chuckles and exclaims, ""It's me!!!""  The father and daughter clearly admire and love each other.  But the next scene takes place on a jet plane, when PL Travers is crossing the Atlantic on her way to Los Angeles, and her goal is to scrutinize and criticize the movie script, and to scuttle the movie project.  PL Travers is rude to the stewardess and to one of the passengers (a young mother with a baby).

CONTINUAL ARROGANCE.  PL Travers lands in Los Angeles and she is escorted out of the terminal by the limousine driver, a man who is good-natured, chubby, and chatty.  PL Travers complains, ""IT SMELLS LIKE CHLORINE AND SWEAT, DREADFUL!""  The driver makes happy chit-chat, but PL Travers slams the dividing window shut, so that she will not hear the driver talking.  The limo driver is played by Paul Giamatte.

In the hotel room, PL Travers notices that the table has a couple of fruit baskets, that Disney character helium balloons are floating near the dresser, and that plush Disney toys are neatly arranged on the dresser and on the bed.  PL Travers makes arrogant little grunts to herself, and she opens the window and tosses the fruit into the swimming pool, where other guests are lounging in the southern California sun.  Then, PL Travers gathers up the plush toys, and stuffs them into the closet.  The Mickey Mouse plush doll is very large, and PL Travers mutters, ""YOU CAN STAY THERE UNTIL YOU LEARN THE ART OF SUBTLETY.""

MEETING THE TEAM.  At 18 minutes into the movie, the limo driver drops PL Travers off at Disney studios.  Three men are waiting for her.  ""Good morning, Pamela,"" exclaims the script-writer.  ""IT IS SO DISCOMFORTING TO HEAR A PERFECT STRANGER SAY MY FIRST NAME,"" snaps PL Travers, in a fit of arrogance.  The three men are Don DaGradi scriptwriter (played by Bradley Whitford), composer Richard Sherman (played by Jason Schwartsman), and composer Robert Sherman (played by BJ Novak).  The scriptwriter introduces himself, ""I'm DonDaGradi the scriptwriter.""  To this, PL Travers snaps, ""CO-SCRIPT WRITER,"" referring to the fact that PL Travers wants to have a dominant role in controlling what is in the script.

During the part of the story taking place at Disney studios, P.L. Travers becomes more creative and bizarre in her irrational demands, regarding what should or should not be included in the movie.  She insists that the movie not have the color red in it.  She insists that Dick Van Dyke is not suitable for the part, and that instead Laurence Olivier should have the part.  She insists that animation be completely excluded from the movie.

Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) does an excellent job at remaining patient and in maintaining his professional demure, and the viewer will be amused at the continual eye-rolling of the song-writing team, and the mild frustrations of one of the secretaries, in view of the continuing rude, arrogant, and irrational demands of P.L. Travers.  The viewer of this movie will wonder why neither of the men in the song-writing team takes a lead pipe in hand, and bashes P.L. Travers' head, converting it into a gelatinous bloody pulp.

However, at the same time, what continues to be a dominant theme, are continual flashbacks that P.L. Travers has about her childhood.  On the one hand, during her childhood her father recognized her abilities in creative writing and encouraged them, but on the other hand, her father was an alcoholic (drinking hard liquor in the daylight hours) and her father died of tuberculosis in his mid-thirties.  Also, P.L. Travers' mother had her own psychological problems, and attempted suicide.

The viewer is kept in suspense as to whether P.L. Travers will scuttle the project, and prevent the film from ever being made.  Nearly all of the details of this movie are from real-life, and as all viewers know, it was the case that the film Mary Poppins was, in fact, filmed and distributed.  However, this knowledge does not detract from the suspense and drama of this movie.

CONCLUSION.  Unfortunately, many viewers have encountered people possessing the same arrogant and irrational characteristics of PL Travers.  The PL Travers character, in this movie, and PL Travers in real life, persisted on a daily basis in being arrogant and irrational, to the point of bordering on mental illness.  To viewer who have encountered this type of person, SAVING MR. BANKS will have special meaning.  FIVE STARS.",1434412800,2,6774,4.869755244755245

5598922,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Walt Disney spent twenty years trying to get the film rights to P. L. Travers's Mary Poppins novels. This movie focuses on Travers, who is in a tricky situation. Royalties have been drying up, so she could use the money. But she truly dreads the Disney-fication of her beloved Mary Poppins. She doesn't want animation or any silly prancing and dancing about. She decides to go to Los Angeles to work on the script and reassure herself that they won't mess it up. She meets with Walt and starts working with the script writer and two song writers. Things do not go well. She hasn't signed the rights away yet, so they have to do everything they can to convince her. A clash of cultures and personalities ensues.

Intercut with the Hollywood story is Travers's childhood memories from living in Australia, where her family struggles under her father's depression and alcoholism. She as a child is blissfully unaware of the problems because the father is a bit of a dreamer and story teller. He calls his daughter a princess and makes up fantastic tales about people turned into animals and such. Her childhood explains a lot about her attitudes and desires. Emma Thompson gives a great performance as the adult Travers and the rest of the cast is good too.

The movie is a great dramatic story with a satisfying narrative conclusion. My only difficulty is the conclusion that I drew afterwards--I suspect much of the movie is a fabrication for dramatic effect. As a historically-based film, I consider this more like Shadow of the Vampire than Patton.",1433980800,,1549,4.776119402985074

5599037,1,B00BEIYSL4,"I have not seen ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and will not do so.  Everyone should please realize that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is quite simply a very pro-Disney fictionalized version of the issues, events and conflicts between P.L. Travers and Mr. Disney, in which the Disney version could only be told after they waited for P.L. Travers to have died.  P.L. Travers reportedly wept through the entire premiere of ""Mary Poppins"" because, although she was clearly contractually given the right to approve the script and film adaptation, she was continually rebuffed by Disney in every regard.  Yes, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" may have a theme of redemption, and the whole enterprise did, in fact, save P.L. Travers financially -- the truth is that she never liked the film, the music, the dancing penguins.  For anyone who stands up for artists and writers who want to have some creative control over their creative work, buying these two movies together is only supporting the Disney Company's incessant corporate greed and basic trampling on artists/writers/creators.  One need only do some basic research for some various recent P.L. Travers' documentaries on youtube to get a much truer account of what REALLY happened in Travers' life and in her connection to and relationship with Disney.

5599133,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Awesome Disney movie: fantastic acting from Emma Thompson, as usual, & the other characters were fully developed and believable.  My family and I were drawn into the movie emotionally, and we were amazed that the flashback scenes were seamlessly woven into the film.
Only 4 stars because we found out through research that it's really not a true rendering of the story from Mrs. Travers' point of view:  Disney really DID use its imagination to come up with the finished product.
Still, it's a wonderfully written, directed, and visualized film that will make you hum all those delightful songs for days afterward.",1432339200,,614,5.009803921568627

5599185,1,B00BEIYSL4,Was excited about the concept of this movie but disappointed by the story and acting.,1432080000,,85,4.733333333333333
5599186,5,B00BEIYSL4,as described,1432080000,,12,5.5
5599187,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This backstory about the making of the Mary Poppins movie is Disneyfied, but that doesn't detract from the fun that Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks (and his Disney script- and songwriters) have as they duel over artistic control. In flashbacks we learn something about the childhood trauma that author P.L.Travers (Thompson) tried to assuage by writing the book. Disney (Hanks) has his own, possibly sincere, motivation to fulfill a promise to his daughters. Both claim Mary Poppins as ""kin."" Everything ends happily enough, although if you suspect the real Travers and the real Disney were more complicated and less sympathetic than portrayed, you would be right.",1431907200,,660,5.235849056603773
5599188,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This is a stellar performance by Emma Thompson she like Meryl Streep, Judy Davis, Maggie Smith, Judy Dench and Cate Blanchett are just a whole other level above most actors. Her performance is worth watching this film alone. Tom Hanks is also convincing as Walt Disney and delivers as usual.

Colin Farrell is less appealing as the drunk but charming father, although this is just my opinion I am not a big fan of his craft, the appearance of Rachel Griffiths as one of the key inspirational characters is worth the wait! The only flaw in this production is that they chose to sell California landscape off for the Australian state of Queensland, big mistake as it really took away the feeling of authenticity from this film. The light landscape nature and sound are entirely different so whoever made that decision didn't do their homework well at all, some places cannot be done with a set or VFX composites!

Overall great story and watch it for Emma Thompson's performance alone",1431907200,,982,4.770588235294118
5599189,5,B00BEIYSL4,Awesome,1431907200,,7,7.0
5599190,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I thought it was cleverly portrayed. I could tell they 'Hollywooded' it up a bit but the storyline was cute. I have to say the sub story about Travers childhood was a bit rough for my 7 year old to watch. We shelter our kids a bit but it brought up a good conversation.
Emma Thompson was the star of the show for sure. She was fun to watch in this movie.
Good family movie for older kids.",1431907200,,388,3.9871794871794872
5599191,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This film changed my life.  To get a behind the scenes look at these awesome, amazing genius's was a true thrill.  For any Disney fan, or fan of Mary Poppins, this is a definite must see.

It goes to show that no one, not even Walt Disney, in terms of business, is not fraught with constant problems and tremendous difficulty.  No matter how much Pamela Travers pushed, and pushed for her own way, when the film screened, she saw it, and gave her comments.

Walt Disney emphatically said, ""My dear.  That ship has sailed!"".

It's very important to clean up well in the end, and that's precisely what he did.

In addition, the back and forth cuts between Pamela Travers' life and the rest of the film fits perfectly.

Go and see this film!

If you are looking for graphic violence, graphic sex, graphic language, go look someplace else because you won't find that here (THANK GOD) .  This is a wonderful story of how Walt Disney came to make Mary Poppins. He tried for 20 years to get the rights from the writer, P.L. Travers, a very difficult and unhappy woman.  The movie is not only about the trials & tribulations Disney went through with her so he could make the movie, it also shows P.L. Travers growing up in Australia and her difficult life (which molded her).  What a refreshing movie. This proves when you have a good story, you do not need all the graphic language, violence, or sex. Too bad there aren't more movies like this.

I liked the performance of the actor who played Travers Golf.  I did not recognize that he is an established actor.  Recently, I began watching movies Russell Crowe starred in which lead me to the more current Winters Tale.  When I looked up the actor who played Peter Lake in Winters Tale, I realized I had seen him before in Phone Booth, Horrible Bosses and Miami Vice.  All one and the sameColin Farrell!

While Mary certainly is 'practically perfect in every way'....adding the background film with Tom Hanks adds so much.  Tom Hanks' aggressive portrayal of 'Uncle Walt' brings out the fact that when the real Disney wanted an actor, cameraman or composer...he usually got his wish.  Emma Thompson portrays PL Travers perfectly and constantly challenges Hanks whenever he suggests an idea. [I love the bit about the dancing penguins].

5599551,2,B00BEIYSL4,"Walt Disney was nothing like the man Tom Hanks portrays in this movie.

Disney was an American icon, whose studio and theme parks have played significant roles in American pop culture. However, Disney was an enigmatic man unlike anything shown in this movie. Disney was far from the beloved, grandfatherly executive Hanks plays on screen. In fact, Disney was known to be a difficult and sometimes unpleasant man who paid low wages and worked his animators to exhaustion. In short, life in the Disney creative offices was not the great big party depicted in Saving Mr. Banks.

I understand it's a family movie, and clearly most people have enjoyed the show. But I have trouble getting on board something that plays very loose with how things really went down.",1425859200,3,758,4.868217054263566

5599575,3,B00BEIYSL4,"This is one of those movies plagued by a great preview.  Or maybe the movie really just wasn't that good.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  Personal preferences vary widely.  If you want to know what the movie is about, you shouldn't be reading here.  What I can tell is that it is:

a) fairly family friendly.  Although if your kids haven't seen Mary Poppins or don't at least have a good knowledge of Disney, they probably won't understand most of it.
b) not worth owning.  You may disagree, but after seeing it once, I don't know if I'll ever watch it again.
c) more than laced with some hard back story material that is not disparaging but also isn't easy.

Bottom line, since you don't know me or my preferences, is that you can count this as one more vote to make this movie a rental rather than an item in your collection.",1425340800,,831,4.309677419354839

5599577,1,B00BEIYSL4,Okay -- I'm gonna rain on everyone's happy parade. .I was utterly disgusted by the bad behavior of P. L. Travers (played by Emma Thompson).  But for Disney to NOT invite her to the premier of her work/movie was just plain RUDE.  Didn't either of these two people learn anything about good manners?  Were they raised by wolves?  I felt like crying throughout this movie but only because I paid for my very own copy based on other glowing reviews here.  Don't compound my error by wasting you money on it.,1425254400,2,503,4.483516483516484
5599578,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks. VERY GOOD movie. The actors and actresses did a great job. Yes, because this movie was based on real events, some people like to nitpick on the historical inaccuracies, if you want to know about those, just look on IMDb, people have already listed all the little movie errors. But I felt they did a good job and I felt transported back in time. The movie was very heart wrenching, so if you go, expect to shed some tears. The progress of the movie did feel a little slow in the beginning, I was slightly bored, but it picked up as the drama increased in the flashbacks.
 Yes, this movie was based on real events, but it was highly dramatized.
I read the book this movie is based on, plus the Mary Poppins book and movie. To see my review and comparison of all four, go to my blog: https://mizner13.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/saving-mr-banks-seen-in-theaters-20-dec/",1425168000,,881,4.758169934640523

While it would have been nice if the healing experienced by Ms. Travers in the movie had been an accurate depiction of reality, it was not.  Wikipedia's article on P. L. Travers in the Mary Poppins section, tells a different story in which Ms. Travers could never reconcile with the Disney production and portrayal of her beloved character.  Saving Mr. Banks, however, is true to the Disney reputation for tense action and conflict followed by positive resolution.  I prefer the movie, which once again gives us all hope that we have within us an optimistic, positive self and we can find it with a little help from our friends.",1424649600,,758,4.844961240310077

5599841,5,B00BEIYSL4,"*Please note that my copy is the normal DVD copy*
For a Disney film, this is really an anomaly.  And as such, you will come out loving it or totally at a loss.  It is very very heavy and seemingly lacks the ""Disney Magic"" in the typical sense of the word.  But as is with life, magic is never really lost...but something that needs to be discovered and at times rediscovered.  In the end, this was such a touching, heartfelt, and hopeful film.

CONTENT ISSUES:
You won't really have to worry too much about innuendos and sexual things.  However, it does earn it's PG-13 rating due to its really heavy themes.  This is based off of a true story...and frankly life isn't always pretty for some folks.  I'm not one for laying down spoilers, but I do think in this one instance I should...I'll keep it as generic and non-definitive as I can, though.  For instance, their is an instance of an attempted suicide.  In another, someone coughs up blood into a handkerchief (you don't see blood flying through the air...just the aftermath as the person looks at the handkerchief).  In addition to this, there are two instances of ""D---"".

ABOUT THE FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
""Marry Poppins"" is, by far, one of most iconic of live-action Disney features.  It is a wonderful film with wonderful themes that can move a human soul.  Yet, part of what makes it so powerful is the fact that the author (Mrs. Travers) of the source material faced heart wrenching situations and that transfers into the film.  This film, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the tale of this woman and how she, with Walt Disney and the production staff saved Mr. Banks and set Mary Poppins free.

The thing about this film is that initially...it's somewhat confusing as the cuts between ""present"" and ""flashbacks"" is a bit sudden without any lead up.  You may be confused at first...yet, it works out.  Also, Mrs. Travers is right-off-the-bat a ""conundrum"".  Frankly, I did not like her one bit in the beginning...yet as the film progresses and her ghosts become known, you start to understand.  They don't excuse her actions...but you realize that it's an important set-up.  And remembering that this is based off of true events...there's just no getting around people's attitudes...if they were like that...they were like that.

In finishing this film, it gives you such a new appreciation for ""Mary Poppins"".  It doesn't give you a ""new insight"" into the film...but deepens the meaning that is already plainly there.  In addition to this, you gain a new respect for Disney AND his creative team...they are the heroes of this film.  When most would have given up on a person like Mrs. Travers, they did not...even though they obviously came close to breaking points at several spots.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Just a deleted scene.

ALL IN ALL,
This is a very important film that gives us insight into the inspiration and struggle for Mary Poppins.  To think we almost never would have had such an iconic and inspiring character as her had circumstances been different.  This definitely has a different feel from most Disney films...but even though the magic is a tad bit different...it is still evidently there.",1422576000,,3162,4.792975970425139

5599927,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Movie Review: Disney fans will love this behind-the-scenes glimpse of the creation of Mary Poppins.  I have read biographies on my hero Walt Disney, and I saw many details in the film that I remember reading about, such as the photo portraying Walt's steam engine train. Tom Hanks does an admirable job as Mr. Walt Disney. Emma Thompson was delightfully prickly as the author. It's a heartwarming tale that will make you laugh and cry, and has become one of my favorite movies. It left me hungry for a biopic!  Wish the Disney Company would get on that!!

Blu Ray Review:  The film was in beautiful sharp definition and the sound was amazing (a must with all the Mary Poppins song clips). I loved the special feature of the cast's tribute to Mr. Richard Sherman (one of the original songwriters of the Mary Poppins movie). If that doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're not human!!  Another plus was listening the the original recording of the author's dictation notes.",1421539200,,971,4.72189349112426

I think the acting was superb, and it was special to get a brief glimpse into the creative process at Disney during that era. I love the integrity and sincerity that the artists (even those with emotional issues) all attempted to hold as they brought stories and characters to life. I was particularly touched by the portrayal of compassion and attempts at understanding that Walt Disney showed for this woman and her beloved Mary Poppins and Mr Banks characters.

While the story could be considered interesting as a backdrop to the creation of the movie ""Mary Poppins"", my (adult) family and I found it very depressing and slow. In viewing the trailers, they hinted at some amusing spots in the movie, but I think they covered all of them - which were few in number. I have always been a big fan of Disney family movies, but I guess I bought this with that thought in my mind. I don't write many reviews, but wanted to make sure others considering this purchase knew  that it's a very somber movie and not for small children.

Perhaps that was the point and we were just to illiterate to figure it out?  What was with the two movies at the same time all about really.  Why are we going from the 1960's to the 1900's at the same time?  This was not a movie about Walt Disney, it was a movie about the author which all the adverts were a tad misleading.  If you want the life story of the author then this is the movie for you.  Whether they portrayed the story accurately or not I do not know but even if they did I don't think it would save this flick.

Thank heavens for Tom Hanks who I do not like on a personal level with all the interviews I have seen but he is a great actor and the saving grace for the brief moments he was in it.  Emma Thompson I do not understand why people think she is so fantastic.  Every character she plays is played the same way with the possible exception of Nanny McPhee.  I try to never watch a movie she is in,  if you keep her in the same clothing in different movies you could not her characters apart.

5600249,1,B00BEIYSL4,"Sorry, very disappointed.  In view of the large film-making capital investment, A-rated actors, and major studio 'hype' promotion, I honestly did not expect this kind of a film result.  Although childhood flashbacks can be effectively used in films, I did not like the constant back-and-forth flashback style in this one -- seemingly every few minutes -- which becomes distractive and disjointed, jarring.  Some other narrative structure should have been devised, for the script.  I would favor a more strictly authentic biographical presentation.

It is amazing and devious, if not even somewhat bizarre, that this apparently abrasive, offensive, and disturbed woman produced a written childhood classic that was totally opposite to her own adult character.  There is a deep story and drama in that, but this movie was not it.

The very qualities that the readers of the original book about Mary Poppins loved -- including humor, compassion, and love -- are not in evidence in this dismal account of a very obnoxious, offensive woman writer, in the film.",1418428800,2,1055,5.244047619047619

Directed by John Lee Hancock. Written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith.

This is the story of Pamela L. Travers (Emma Thompson). We see her childhood in 1906 in England. In April 1961, at the suggestion of her agent, he pleads her to go to the United States to sell her story of Mary Poppins to Walt Disney. She just doesn't want to. it is her character. Her agent reminds her she does need the money. She decides she would like to keep her house.
  So she flies to Los Angeles, California. Mrs. Travers is quite cantankerous. She is not amused by the complimentary gifts and fruit basket she has received from Walt Disney. She throws the fruit into the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel. She has a studio driver, Ralph (Paul Giamatti) that drives her to Burbank at the alt Disney Productions. There, she meets screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and the Sherman brothers, Robert (B.J. Novak) and Richard (Jason Schwartzman). Then finally Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) himself who is very nice and welcoming to her, but Mrs. Travers, as she prefers to be called, is still stuffy. Walt Disney has been trying to obtain ""Mary Poppins"" for 18 years from the first time he read the book 20 years years ago.
  Walt and the Sherman brothers have wonderful ideas for the Mary Poppins movie and making it a delightful musical, but Mrs. Travers wants to be difficult in every way, putting in her own creative control, before papers are signed.
  We shall see who wins.

Also in the cast: Colin Farrell, Annie Rose Buckley, Ruth Wilson, Kathy Baker, Rachel Griffiths, Ronan Vibert.

  My wife was 9/months pregnant with our 4th child.  It was a recession and I did not know what to do.  My wife did not work and was in no condition to help.  I was deep in debt and depressed.  One day, for my kids, I watched Mary Poppins.

  I remember weeping as the father courageously climbed those bank steps, knowing he would be fired, and not knowing what the future held other than he loved his family.  I received great courage that I felt was heaven inspired.  I've shared my copy with perhaps a dozen others who needed to find strength within themselves for the sake of others.  I thought that whole story line was just for me.

Now there is a movie that no one has heard of, detailing why Walt Disney pressed so hard for the rights to make Poppins.  Turns out Walt knew exactly what he was doing for me and others like me.

Saving Mr Banks is excellent, with typical creative liberties necessary to save the story.  Watch Mary Poppins, then watch Saving Mr. Banks, then watch Poppins again.  Watch it onFathers Day, or when you just lost your job and don't know what to do...",1416873600,3,1129,4.3

The interweaving of her childhood with the current story of Disney trying to convince her to approve of him making a film about Mary Poppins was very effectively done.  Watching her increasingly irritating character, the film gradually reveals that her exasperating rigidity was connected with profound childhood suffering.  There were points where we were in tears, feeling the pain and loss that she, as a young child, endured.  This film was heartbreaking to watch at times, but always engaging and even inspirational, particularly Walt Disney's persistence and understanding of her.  This is a must-see movie.

5600565,1,B00BEIYSL4,"Man, was this a pointless and boring film.  Not to mention DEPRESSING.  If you are looking for a family film from Disney, run away from this bunk.  Expendables is more heart-warming than this.

Incredible acting, yes.  Decent script, yes.  It just simply is not interesting, exciting, heart-warming, or clever.  It moves slowly, from one depressing scene to the next.

Based on a true story, it makes sure to leave out the worst qualities of both Disney and Travers.  In truth, Disney dumped Travers on the Sherman brothers and made himself scarce.  He never wooed her into giving up her book.  Poverty convinced her to take the deal.  In fact, the deal was done before she even left good ole England.

She never fell for any of the songs.  And she sure as hell never felt touched by the film at the premiere.  In fact, she railed against it and demanded things be changed, but Disney replied to her that that ship had sailed.  He tricked her into a deal in which she had some script rights, but failed to mention that animation would be considered film editing.  So, everything she hated would be stuffed into the film.

Now, Disney was right about everything he did to the story, but that was pretty underhanded.

Travers on the other hand was indeed a monster.  A mentally ill writer who promised to adopt two Irish twins, then separated them for life at the last moment.  She took one home and lied to him, saying he had no other family and his father had died in America.  Years later, the other brother tracked them down.  And a real life depressing story took place.  You can Google it.

Basically, Saving Mr. Banks is a movie that claims to be true but glosses over and ignores the truth in order to sprinkle fairy dust all over two human beings who were not very nice or likable.

I'd rather watch Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh in a new Saw movie, frankly.  It would be just as true and endearing as this flop.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Only hardcore Disney-ites will praise this film.  As they slurp loudly from the master's Kool-aid cup.",1415059200,13,2044,4.505464480874317

5600570,4,B00BEIYSL4,"The cinematic version of story of PL Travers' book-into-film that was to become Walt Disney's Mary Poppins, written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and directed by John lee Hancock, is light and fluffy and fun - and a bit too long. It boasts a fine cast and for the most part is credible.
The plot has been described as follows: `When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.'

Emma Thompson offers a fine caricature of PJ Travers, Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, but the credits for stunning performances go to Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson as the parents of Travers as young child. If the rest of the film feels a bit `pushed' then remember it is about Walt Disney....Grady Harp, November 14",1414886400,2,1805,4.748407643312102

It should either have told the story primarily from the viewpoint of Walt Disney or satisfied itself with detailing the childhood of P. L. Travers and how it influenced the writing of Mary Poppins.

But, like all Hollywood movies, it digresses from the real facts, which would be just as interesting as the Disney version. However, Disney couldn't miss the opportunity to make Walt look better than he ever was. The story line regarding Travers being finally convinced by Disney to sign the contract, didn't happen. Disney already had the rights. But, Travers did have script approval, at least to a point, but Walt had final cut approval and that's were they fought.

Almost feel Tom was phoning it in most of the time.

Movie is a little slow at the beginning, once you figure out that Emma Thompson's character is all about, the picture gets much better (movie is worth watching again once you understand the whole story).  Back story is a little dry, but again, the characters are well done.

5600875,5,B00BEIYSL4,"An amazing movie!  It brings you back to simpler, purer times, when a person's 'word' was his/her bond!  Beautiful depiction of Walt Disney by Tom Hanks, and Emma Thompson's portrayal of P.T. Travers (the author of Mary Poppins) is uncanny!

This movie makes liberal use of flashbacks (a bit too many, I think) in order to help the viewer keep things in perspective, and P.T. Travers' early life as a child was not often a pleasant one -- with her father addicted to alcohol.  And yet the sorrow that she experiences from that is played against her deep love and devotion to her dad, and his to her.  In essence, you get 'both sides of the story' -- which, in the end, help to give a realistic depiction of what her life was really like.

Paul Giamatti adds to the movie's richness as the limo driver and main protagonist in helping Mrs. Travers to overcome her past 'ghosts' and move into the present -- to start savoring and enjoying life!

The movie is easy to follow and totally absorbing.  Some might call it 'hoakey' or 'square' because it does not contain explicit sex or violence -- it's more of a Frank Capra type of film......family-oriented, but very young children might not appreciate it as much as older children and, especially, people who lived through the ""Walt Disney"" era.

This is a very satisfying movie, with a great ending.  There are good subject areas throughout to explore with your children afterwards.  The morals, ethics, honor, honesty, true-friendship, loyalty........these are all covered clearly and beautifully.

I highly recommend this movie to folks who find themselves saying ""They just don't know how to make movies like they used to years ago.""  Oh no?  Watch this one!",1412294400,2,1708,4.784982935153583
5600876,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Nicely written....wonderful music....... and acting is terrific by everyone involved. I think the story gets a bit difficult at some points to understand because it jumps around continually and that slows it down as we're trying to figure out where we are, so perhaps that could have had more attention but, all is well that ends well is perhaps the order of the day here.
I'm at a disadvantage with this one since Walt Disney is already a life time hero of mine, so anything about him gains my favor I guess and especially this one as Tom Hanks does a good job of capturing him I think.

5600934,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This is an enjoyable film entirely lacking in subtlety. It starts in the early 1960s, at a point when famed U.S. cartoonist and entertainer Walt Disney has been trying for 20 years to persuade prickly author PL Travers to sign over the rights to her Mary Poppins books. Her resistance starts to crumble when she realises she needs more money to keep her fancy London home. Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks are both excellent in their leading roles, which helps the film roll along quite nicely. The author is soon in Los Angeles and quickly drives mad the poor Disney employees who have to knock the book into a musical. The Poppins book is very much entangled in the author's conflicted relationship with her alcoholic father as she was growing up in Australia and we see perhaps one too many scenes of him drinking too much in the red desert sand and making a fool of himself before he dies when she is still very young. You're left in no doubt about the role his absence in her life played. That said, for a Disney movie Saving Mr Banks is actual quite thoughtful. The quality of the writing is excellent and before you know it, two hours is up and the film is over. Recommended.",1412121600,,1177,4.47906976744186

5600942,5,B00BEIYSL4,"If you want to see the fine performances of Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson and an insightful story about PL Travers' life- the story behind the happy one of Mary Poppins, then see this movie. But it is not one to take your kids to for a fun time. PL Travers suffered some very serious issues with her family life, and that's what this story goes into in depth. It's worth telling, and it shows us where her idea for Mary Poppins came from.

Travers' interaction with happy Walt Disney is interesting. Toward the end, she learns that he had some hard times in his early life as well that he has managed to overcome.

Note: I think some of what Hanks said about Disney's life with his father was made up by the writers. I have read numerous biographies of Walt, and none of them have ever talked about his father beating him with a belt buckle. Sure, he worked very hard delivering papers as a boy, but it was to help support the family...his brother did the same work. What was expected of Walt seems incredibly brutal to us in this modern time, but back then hard work was not unusual. He was never resentful toward it.",1411948800,,1116,4.3349282296650715

5601127,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Walt Disney wanted to make this movie after seeing his daughters' interest in the book. He contacted Mrs. Travers but was turned down. He tried again each year until she finally acceded after nearly twenty years. It had to be on her terms; though, she was irascible and fastidious and intransigent and cantankerous. In dealing with her, Mr. Disney had the patience of a Tibetan monk, and his script writers and other associates reserve judgment, treating her kindly and being complaisant; they were splendid, with the limousine driver the most laudable for connecting with her on a personal level! Throughout the film, there are flashback scenes of Mrs. Pamela Traver's childhood growing up with a bibulous father. When he was sober, he was a charming, doting parent, lavishing her with attention. When he was inebriated from drinking, his behavior was mercurial and aleatory. It's apparent she had a disturbing upbringing and the lingering effects are replayed in her adult life. She is choleric and gets upset with asperity over trivial disagreements. For instance, at the studio in L.A., she became irritated that the color red appeared in the movie. Another time, she became irate that animated dancing penguins were choreographed into a scene, went on a rant, a tirade, stormed off the set and flew home. Mr. Disney heard of her departure and was on the next 11-hour flight to London. Once there, Walt had a long conversation with Pamela, he talked about memories of a harsh childhood, growing up in Missouri, delivering newspaper before and after school, a difficult and demanding father. He shared his vision of the film and the reaction of awe and thrill it would bring to a young audience. His discourse touched a chord with Mrs. Travers, and she signed over her rights. Some weeks later, she heard of the premiere and hadn't received an invitation, she was back in L.A., in Mr. Disney's office, caterwauling about why not. The oversight was corrected and they joined that evening to attend the event. Upon viewing the magnificence of the presentation of her book on the big screen, she was overcome with emotion. A must see, wonderful film!",1410739200,,2150,4.958448753462604

5601131,2,B00BEIYSL4,"The movie is fantastic and I definitely recommend it, however, choose carefully who you buy your dvd from. I purchased mine from arrow-media, who described the dvd as very good, when in fact it wasn't. The dvd case was very flimsy and the plastic was nicked and stretched in a few places. As for the dvd, there were MANY scuff marks and it had to skip over a damaged area. I would NOT recommend this seller and I probably will not buy from them again.",1410566400,,451,4.317647058823529

5601184,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Did not like Emma Thompsons character, even when her issues are made known. She was a mean bully who had no one in her life. It takes the joy out of Mary Poppins to find out that it was written by some one so devoid of joy or likeability.",1410480000,,238,3.877551020408163

5601186,5,B00BEIYSL4,"With over 2,000 reviews why in the world would I take the time to write one more? There is a simple reason, I liked the movie so much I felt I had to express my appreciation for the story and the movie which tells it so effectively.

I have a really, really lot of company when I say I've watched and enjoyed the movie, ""Mary Poppins"" many times. When watching the movie, I had no idea what had gone into making the movie a reality or how long the planning for the movie had lasted. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" tells the story beautifully and left my wife and me feeling good about life and thankful to have seen it.

Some have complained the movie was sadder than expected but is this not the way of life? Do we not all have moments of sadness from which we must recover? This is a movie of persistence and determination to effectively deal with sadness and turn it into joy; this is a movie about the cloud's silver lining.

At first I was puzzled by the title, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" but as the movie unfolded, I came to understand the longing sadness that haunted J. L. Travers as she penned the story; the feelings of guilt and longing that lurked just beneath the surface.

As a husband and father I could relate to Mr. Banks as he walked, all alone, to the bank that night to face his accusers. I suspect all of us have had moments like that where important outcomes were to be decided over which we felt we had little or no control.

I was touched by the scene in the theater where P. L. Travers broke down and sobbed; finally able to release the suppressed emotions she had bottled up inside herself for years.

Mr. Banks had been saved; her story had been successfully completed!

I recommend this movie for all who love life and rejoice in life and living.",1410480000,2,1754,4.296969696969697
5601187,5,B00BEIYSL4,"What a great pairing! We had rented Saving Mr. Banks and all of us immediately wanted to rewatch Mary Poppins. The next day, my husband said he wanted to watch Saving Mr. Banks again! So I bought this twin set. Both discs are high quality and show as they should, even with good special features.

5601227,3,B00BEIYSL4,"The two leads are written as cardboard cutout cliches for most of the film.  If you pay close attention, the camera hardly ever frames them in the same shot, but rather bounces between endless cutaways.  I also disliked the high contrast cinematography that created harsh glares and deep shadows.  It would have looked so much better on 35mm film than digital.  Finally, the flashbacks were too lengthy and yet not revealing enough.  The real life inspiration for Mary Poppins barely gets three minutes of screen time.  I don't blame the actors, who gave their best effort under these limitations.",1410048000,,597,4.97979797979798

1. As the story developed, you grew more compassionate towards the main character as someone with a troubled past.
2. The incredible patience shown by Walt Disney and his staff towards Mrs. Travers and her difficult demeanor.
3. The speech Walt Disney gives to Mrs. Travers towards the end.
4. The story this movie tells.

There are definitely things I can say about this movie that I disliked, but I feel they are very obvious in the movie and are therefore unnecessary to spell out here.",1409529600,,526,4.655913978494624

5601324,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Are Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson ever bad in any role they take on?  I don't think so.  If Tom Hanks isn't Walt Disney, he certainly captures the feel of Disney.  And although I know nothing about PL Travers, Emma's ""Mrs. Travers"" as she insists that she be addressed, is a woman who is at once annoying,  sad, pathetic and yet redeemable with a little Disney, and pixie dust thrown in to work their magic. It's a very interesting story that I am sure most viewers, whether they ever saw  Disney's Mary Poppins or not, are not familiar with.  The film is really two stories in one.  Disney and his crew are trying to get Travers' permission and cooperation to make the movie, and the other tells the story of  Travers' childhood, that helps us understand why she is so possessive of her beloved character.  By the way, keep and eye on that wonderful scene stealer, Paul Giamatti.  He is terrific, as is Colin Ferrell, in an unusual role for him.",1409184000,,944,4.4678362573099415

5601327,5,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" was a very uplifting movie without being too cutesy.  It was an untold story about another movie very near and dear to many people's hearts.  Many of us have grown up with Mickey Mouse and his creator the amazing Walt Disney.  As always Tom Hanks came through as the hero.  He was up against a very strong willed woman who was not going to budge on her perception of Mary Poppins because she truly knew her.  This was one of those relaxing movies with excellent banter.  It covered all the emotions and left me wanting more.  That's how I often judge movies, do I want it to keep going or am I so glad it has reached the end!  I'm way past having to worry about PG movies but it's so enjoyable to watch a movie that you'd feel comfortable watching with a child.  I would watch it again even though I know the ending now.",1408924800,,839,4.226415094339623

5601479,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Just watched this movie because it looked like an interesting story. While I still think it is an interesting story, the actual movie was a bit overly motivated (not very dynamic of a tale) and the narrative arc tiresome and grating. Emma Thompson's character is simply just a grumpy controlling closed off individual who is unpleasant for 90% of the movie. This makes for a particularly un-dynamic story as there is little change or growth that occurs and there is little vulnerability or insight into her as a person (the juxtaposed vignettes from her childhood are nice but don't reduce the sting of witnessing her terrible personality or even help to explain it, as she seems entirely wonderful as a child and nothing like she is as an adult. There is no explained progression from her joyful disposition as a child to her entirely opposite personality as an adult and the traumatic even she experiences as a child isn't presented in way that adequately and convincingly explains the shift).

Basically, if you like to see someone be verbally horrible to several Disney employees (and Mr. Disney himself) in a British accent for an hour and a half then you might enjoy this. There is an engaging and sad story about her life which appears in flashbacks but their juxtaposition -- for me -- didn't diminish the sting of her constant and one-dimensionally annoying personality.

That said, I'm now definitely interested in reading more about the back story of Mary Poppins and reading the original novel.",1408320000,,1506,4.901960784313726

They say a good book is based on the writer's life experience or in the words of some English professors, ""...you can only write honestly about what you've experienced in life...""

5601517,5,B00BEIYSL4,"A truly remarkable and touching movie that should be seen after watching Mary Poppins, otherwise, like most of the people that rated this movie with a 1-Star, you just won't get it.  This is not a movie for children and I don't believe that anyone under the age of 18 won't have the life experiences to appreciate and understand the events in this story.  Having seen Mary Poppins 4 times in the movie theaters when it was first released, I have an intimate knowledge of the story line as most Baby Boomers do, so this movie made perfect sense to me, although it was a little disconcerting to see P.L. Travers real life hardships that went into creating the story line.  It becomes apparent that if it weren't for P.L Travers involvement/collaboration during the making of Mary Poppins, it would not have had the great success that it did.  The acting is Oscar worthy, the period scenes are amazingly accurate, the story is engaging, and the Disney philosophy portrayed is right on the money.  If you've seen and love Mary Poppins, then have tissues on hand, because you'll need them.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone over 18 that has seen the movie Mary Poppins.",1407974400,,1170,4.660194174757281

5601559,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I liked the story. Hanks did a good job as Disney. I grew up with Sunday night ""Worderful World of Disney"", and Hanks reminded me of him in the shows. Thompson played the proper English uptight prude, and reminded me of a strict English teacher I had in elementary school. The story was a surprise, since I loved the Mary Poppins movie, but knew nothing of the original book or author. It was hard to imagine the story could be written by a person that had so many childhood hang ups.  The movie suggests Disney was the reason for the magical quality of Poppins, which I want to believe is true, since I have been a fan since childhood. The movie is worth a watch.",1407628800,,664,4.312

5601611,5,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Walt Disney spent twenty years in pursuit of the film rights to P.L. Travers' popular novel, ""Mary Poppins,"" a quest he began in the 1940s as a promise to his two daughters. When Travers travels from London to Hollywood in 1961 to finally discuss Disney's desire to bring her beloved character to the motion picture screen, Disney meets a prim, uncompromising sexagenarian not only suspect of the impresario's concept for the film, but a woman struggling with her own past. During her stay in California, Travers reflects on her childhood in 1906 Australia, a trying time for her family that not only molded her aspirations to write, but one that also inspired the characters in her 1934 book. None more so than the one person whom she loved and admired more than any other-her caring father, Travers Goff, a tormented banker who, before his untimely death that same year, instills the youngster with both affection and enlightenment (and who would be the muse for the story's patriarch, Mr. Banks, the sole character that the famous nanny comes to aid). While reluctant to grant Disney the film rights, Travers comes to realize that the acclaimed Hollywood storyteller has his own motives for wanting to make the film-which, like the author's, hint at the relationship he shared with his own father.

The cast led by Emma Thompson (in a superb performance as P.L. Travers) & Tom Hanks (just as superb as Walt Disney) is excellent. The directing by John Lee Hancock is excellent. The story & screenplay by Kelly Marcel & Sue Smith is excellent.

The music by Thomas Newman is excellent. The cinematography by John Schwartzman is excellent. The film editing by Mark Livolsi is excellent. The casting by Ronna Kress is excellent. The production design by Michael Corenblith is excellent. The art direction by Lauren E. Polizzi is excellent. The set decoration by Susan Benjamin, set dressings by Lawson Brown, set designs by Lorrie Campbell, Steve Christensen & Sally Thornton is excellent. The costume design by Daniel Orlandi is excellent. The special effects coordinated by J.D. Schwalm is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Vincent Cirelli & Simon Mowbray is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Charlie Brewer is excellent.

This is an excellent and well-crafted film that is entertaining and interesting, as well as, intriguing. Emma Thompson & Tom Hanks both give superb and well-crafted performances as P.L. Travers & Walt Disney. John Lee Hancock has made another excellent and well-done film to add to his film resume. This was one of the best movies of the last winter season, and was also an awards contender, as well.",1407628800,,2698,5.00445434298441
5601612,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Surprising, to say the least.  Went in thinking it was going to be all about Hanks' Uncle Walt trying to convince P. L. Travers that the Disney brand is the best way to go.  Not the case.  Instead we're treated to a journey back to Ms. Travers' childhood--with all the horribly rough bumps.  A different kind of story.  Very easy-going pace.

5601663,5,B00BEIYSL4,"What is it about this movie so many of us love so much? At first blush, it sounds boring as all get out. Disney woos a recalcitrant author of children's books who reminds us of J. M. Barrie for film rights to her book. Now, it's a sad person who doesn't like Mary Poppins, but this back story to film rights? Who cares, right? It turns out a lot of us do. While it may not match the reality of a more complex and less happy story, the movie version is a story of freeing redemption. Mrs. Travers (neither the honorific nor the name are fully real) is released from the past, Mr. Banks is redeemed and, thus, Mrs. Travers' love for her father. So it's a great story with universal themes. What truly makes this a fabulous movie is the execution - it is told well. The cast is terrific with amazing depth to all the roles, that talent is well used and the editing is spot on. There are a couple of side stories that only add to the film rather than distract from it. Like the side stories, the cinematography is beautiful and subservient to the story. This is a visual story about two storytellers and every element in the film is focused on that story.

As for the common criticisms, I simply don't care if it is accurate to real events.  It is a movie and artistic license is permitted.  I also don't care that that movie does not show Walt Disney's flaws.  Where is it written that a fictionalized movie has to show a person's flaws in some kind of exchange in order to portray a person's good qualities?

What is far more important is that the movie works on its own terms and Saving Mr. Banks works very, very well.  It is entertaining, funny, and moving.  It oddly reminds me of the Andy Griffith Show in the way it demonstrates conflict resolution through understanding and compassion.

I suspect there will be an age divide on this one.  Younger audiences might not care for it while older generations will appreciate its throwback sensibilities that hearken back to a simpler time gone by.

I love Saving Mr. Banks.",1406937600,,981,4.6725146198830405

5601737,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Wow.  I like ""Mary Poppins.""  It's a well-executed film that is entertaining for adults as well as children, which is good because my 7 year old likes to watch it a lot.  So, I expected to be somewhat entertained by a movie about Walt Disney getting the rights to the original source material - a famously difficult exercise that took him 20 years.  Instead, my expectations were blown away by something truly great.

""Saving Mr. Banks"" is essentially two parallel movies - the first, the story of Mrs. Travers' two-week visit to Walt Disney Studios during which Walt's team worked with her to develop a script she would find acceptable; the second, the story of Mrs. Travers as a young girl in Australia.  The two are intertwined and important to each other.  Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks are both fantastic, as is the entire supporting cast.  Paul Giamatti doesn't have a lot of screen time, and during his first couple of appearances you will think, hey, that guy sure looks a lot like Paul Giamatti but you won't realize it's him.  He quietly steals more than his share of attention.  Whoever plays young Mrs. Travers is fantastic as well.  You just can't beat the performances in this film.

""Saving Mr. Banks"" also ends up being touching and sentimental without being manipulative or maudlin or syrupy.

This was a wonderful surprise that I can recommend wholeheartedly.",1406678400,2,1375,4.8

5601994,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I enjoyed this movie, but I doubt its veracity.  Travers was an artist with a Jungian orientation and a lot of ideas about mythology etc., but the movie presents her as a tiresome egotistical neurotic who secretly wallows in sentimentality.  It also soft pedals Disney's disingenuous insistence on using animation in the film.  In fact, the animation in Mary Poppins is lousy, and I've read that Travers confronted Disney angrily about it after the premier and was more less told, ""tough, little lady."" The Los Angeles and London segments are fun, but the Australian part mostly is an over-sentimentalized bore, except for the arrival of the ""original ""Mary Poppins"" toward the end.  Would have liked more of that.  And, speaking of veracity, couldn't Disney Inc. afford to do Australian locations in Australia instead of California?  Bit ridiculous to have Travers saying how much she hates California when-- according to what's on the film-- she spent her childhood on a ranch there surrounded by oaks and chaparral-- not eucalyptus and wattle.",1405814400,,1046,5.123529411764705
5601995,5,B00BEIYSL4,A very engaging view in the making of Mary Poppins and the amount of effort Walt Disney went to keep a promise to his daughter.  Emma Thompson is an amazing actress and she certainly makes this role of the author come to life.

This is Walt Disney's desire to appease his family member and make the movie Mary Poppins and the horrific attitude of the author of that book. Totally boring. IF I had known the story first this purchase would never have been made.  I'm dumbfounded that Tom Hanks,whom I adore as an actor, and/or Emma Thompson, who is a terrific actor, even consented to do this.  IMO it was a total waste of their talent.

5602031,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This is a real heartfelt 1961 true story about Walt Disney, and the many problems him and his writers had, trying to produce this movie, ""Mary Poppins"", as a  classic childhood story.  Tom Hanks stars as Walt Disney, Emma Thompson who plays a prudish English Auther, P L Travers, who wrote the story. Doesn't want to sell him the rights to Mary Poppins. She was almost impossible to please. There are also flashbacks to Traver's 1907 childhood, which lead to disasters in the attempted  production of Mary Poppins. All based on a true story

For the movie viewer, I think if it wasn't for Disney's pleasing attitude, most likely would have never got filmed.  Some of it is funny and all of it is an elaborate story of how some people can really be a super pain to deal with, but Disney did and is professional in every way.

5602037,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Although I have given this five stars, I admit to finding Mary Poppins one of Disney's best (if not the best) live action (primarily) film.  This conflicts with the fact that I don't find Tom Hanks a particularly good actor normally and Emma Thompson can be hit or miss and yet I still gave it a high rating.  The truth is, because Tom Hanks can be pompous and overbearing which apparently bleeds into his acting roles (or perhaps his acting bleeds into his real personality), he was perfect for the womanizing Walt Disney which he gave a surprising amount of charm.  Emma Thompson played a curmudgeon fairly well, although I suspect any weakness in the movie stemmed from a certain typical stiffness with which she played the character (something that she did even with Nanny McPhee, a movie I enjoyed).  One reason I really enjoyed the movie, however, is credited with the storyline, finding the portrayal of Disney's acquisition of the movie rights fascinating!",1405641600,,964,4.859756097560975

5602072,2,B00BEIYSL4,"I expected a lot more than the movie provided. It was a major disappointment. Good actors and that's about all. It could have been much more energetic and appealing if the script and production was done differently. For me, it was slow and dry. It's a movie showing her complaints, pessimism, disapproval, and trauma with only minor dynamics. It has hardly any focus on the making of Mary Poppins. It's more about her personal negative issues throughout her life and with other people. For me, it's like ""okay, so she was never happy in her entire life or in movie making. And then what else?? why did she agree to production?""; well, that isn't explained too much. Disney never really answered to the messages. The only part that gave a positive feel was at the end.

The movie itself is very good, and the acting excellent;  but I was disappointed to learn that a lot of it was fictionalized. Not surprising, as Disney isn't known for its historical accuracy. But it spoiled the movie for me to learn afterwards that many of the best parts didn't actually happen. One of the best characters was completely made up.

What's the point of making a movie about how a movie was made, and then making up the majority of it rather than sticking to the facts? If they had stuck to the facts, the movie wouldn't have been favorable towards Disney. Now they can't have that can they?",1405468800,,733,4.382352941176471

5602241,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I'm writing my review before I read any others that might influence my opinion.  I remember ""Mary Poppins"", the movie, from when I was a child. When my son was small, it was the first movie he watched over and over and over, which meant I did too, thus my interest in ""Saving Mr. Banks"".

""Mary Poppins"", from the casting to acting, writing and music along with a timeless story line, is flawless, sheer perfection, something I say about few movies.  It was interesting to see ""Saving Mr. Banks"" to get behind-the-movie insight into the making of Mary Poppins. I think I read there was some artistic license to the story, and I plan to check that out.  But this movie did a great job of taking us back to the early 1960s, always fun to see when it's done well. I loved all the Disney stuff. Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks and supporting actors and actresses were great. At first, I didn't know if I could stand Emma's character, P.L. Travers, but as the movie continued, I liked how things worked out.  I did love Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, a very convincing portrayal.  For some reason, I loved seeing Kathy Bates as Walt's secretary, even tho its a very minor role.

All in all, a good movie and definitely one I plan to watch again.",1404691200,,1228,4.407079646017699

And most of all, the pivotal moment when Mr. Disney is able to make ""Mary Poppins"" a hit because he discovers that it is not about nannies or children but about ""Saving Mr. Banks"" the children's troubled Father.

However, because it dealt with some childhood issues that will always bother me, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.  That's just me.  Overall, most viewers will probably agree that it's a very good film.

5602378,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Watched Saving Mr. Banks this weekend. It was my husband's Netflix pick. I was not interested, at all. After seeing the trailers (for a year), and based on its Christmas opening, I was expecting a sappy boring saccharine contrived G -rated family friendly (i.e. talk down to the kiddies) Disney-esque comedy about the making of Mary Poppins.

This seems to be one of those cases where studio marketers try to convince the general public that a movie is something it isn't (usually they try to make movies look funny) in order to sell tickets. Because, when we watched it, I was very surprised to find out that Saving Mr. Banks is quite sad.

The author of Mary Poppins, Pamela Travers, was half mad with unresolved guilt and grief over her intensely painful childhood and her deep love for her hopelessly alcoholic father. She wrote her Mary Poppins books out of this deep grief and anguish. The movie is about her conflicts with the wonderful Disney team as they together (hammer and tongs) created the light and happy movie we all have loved for 50 years.

Saving Mr Banks is primarily the story of a wounded and damaged little girl who becomes a wildly successful writer..yet she exists almost completely alone in the world. It is set against the fascinating backdrop of Walt Disney and the Disney company. ""Saving Mr Banks"" is not at ALL like ""Mary Poppins,"" although it is an homage to Mary Poppins' creators.

The actors are terrific, every single one. Colin Farrell as Travers' father was a standout, wonderful, as was Tom Hanks serving as the cornerstone of the movie as the beloved, iconic Walt Disney.

Did I like it? Yes i think i did. It was better than i expected. It was also sadder though. My favorite parts were those having to do with the nostalgic, respectful and wonderful portrayal of Walt Disney, his genius, his character. My least favorite parts, unfortunately, featured the very prickly PL Travers (Emma Thompson was wonderful in her portrayal), which is, obviously the largest part of the movie. Doesn't help that I read the trivia on IMDB afterward and learned that Travers resented Disney until the day she died, and that when Poppins became a Broadway show, she said yes to that project only if Disney wasn't involved and also barred the Shermans, who wrote the beloved music and lyrics to the movie. Biting the hand that feeds you (hands that were so kind to her! and so profitable for her, making it possible for her to stay in the home she loved!) is a very unappealing trait.

Recommendation: Yes, but expect it to be a memoir of a complex, cranky, hard-to-like woman, with the side benefit of a wonderful, beautiful, fascinating look at Disney history. Don't expect a picture about wonderful Disney history, with a side story of a cranky, hard-to-like woman.",1404000000,,2791,4.768115942028985

It's annoying when they aren't included, even being able to download them b/c that is just too much to have to hook up the laptop to their tv (since screen is out and the laptop must be fed through to tv).  So that makes extra work that is unnecessary if only HD disks were included!  If I'm going to buy the Mary Poppins again I want it on Blu-ray, and with this duo it only makes sense to buy them as a set......",1404000000,3,519,3.9711538461538463

""Saving Mr. Banks"" was a touching, well written, well acted movie about a woman who needed saving from herself and the man who did it with love and understanding.

5602504,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Brilliant if it were just fiction, but that it's based on a true story (pretty close in the 'modern' 1960s scenes, and loosely storied in the flashbacks) makes it one of the best films I've seen in a long time.

Added:  Emma Thompson & Colin Farrell deserved awards for their performances.  Actually, everyone did a fantastic job, which points to the director as well as the fine actors/actresses. The camera-work was stunning as well.",1403308800,,435,4.851351351351352

Oh, sure; It's not possible for this to be historically perfectly accurate. BUT it's a great story, well told.  And that's what Disney is all about anyway.  DO see this if you haven't.  And re-watch Mary Poppins in a new light.  Thanks, all who worked on this!",1403136000,,454,4.506172839506172

The story line is difficult as it presents the Mary Poppins' author's childhood as a series of disappointments and problems.  Emma Thompson did a wonderful acting job of presenting a very difficult character who is hard to watch as she interacts with the Disney studios based characters.  We are huge fans of the Disney Mary Poppins movie, so this background on its production was of great interest to us.  We are still feeling mixed about our reactions to this movie.

Was definitely moved by the movie and the story.  It got me to thinking about PL Travers and the way she is portrayed in the movie.  I began  to do some research and found that this story is really all about making Disney look great and Travers look like a curmudgeonly nut forged from a haunted childhood.  After thinking about it, the film really also does her a disservice in not giving her a better voice in the script (not Ms. Thompson's fault) to explain her resistance to giving up creative control of her most beloved character, Mary Poppins.  All this would be ok, if the film did not go to extra lengths to try and convince the audience of the accuracy of the portrayal of the characters (audio clips and photos).  Mrs. Travers lived until 96 and had plenty of uncomplimentary things to say about Disney's treatment of Mary Poppins, which if you went by the film, you would think she ultimately approved of and found cathartic.",1403136000,,1097,4.652849740932642

Walt is played well but he must have had a firmer side to build the company so maybe we are a little revisionist here.  Maybe my expectations were too high.,1403049600,,331,4.030769230769231

What is sad is to find out that P L Travers was even worse in real life than depicted in the movie.  You can read about her on-line, so I won't bother copying it here.  But suffice it to say, she didn't like the movie, didn't like Walt Disney, didn't like Americans and seemed to scar the lives of her adopted son (and his twin she chose not to adopt on the advice of an astrologer!) worse than she was scared by her own upbringing.  Still, she lived to 96 even though her grand-kids are quoted as saying that she ""died loving no one and with no one loving her.""",1402704000,,687,3.9854014598540144

5602668,5,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" provides a glimpse behind the scenes of one of my all-time favorite movies, ""Mary Poppins.""  It isn't a ""making-of"" documentary however.  It is a heart-warming, true story of real people, Walt Disney and Pamela Travers (who wrote the original children's books).  Their own back-stories are as captivating as are their respective creations.

In addition to presenting Disney's long-term and ultimately successful attempt to acquire the film rights from Pamela Travers,  director John Lee Hancock expertly provides a wonderful window on the past of both early twentieth century Australia, where Travers grew up, and 1964 Hollywood.  Even if you don't have ""Mary Poppins"" in your background, this movie is a wonderful treat.  If you are a Poppins fan, your experience will be even more heightened by sequences that ingeniously link the two films.  For film art fans, the production design of Michael Corenblith and costuming by Daniel Orlandi are exquisite, and the Sherman Brothers' wonderful songs from ""Mary Poppins"" are passionately interwoven into Thomas Newman's fine score.  Best of all are the performances by Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks as Travers and Uncle Walt.

Extra features on the Blu-ray version include cut scenes as well as several well-done shorts about the movie, finishing with a video of the short wrap party around the piano with original Poppins song-writer Richard Sherman.",1402617600,,1414,5.328828828828829

5602694,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Good acting...of course. The story line, when you read what it is about or watch the trailers, it is hard to see how you could enjoy the film...except that with Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, most of whatever they choose to act in is better than most. But the acting and nice photography holds you to the story, until you can feel the story taking off on it's own.

Essentially, the lady that wrote Mary Poppins, didn't have a very nice childhood and it soured her. She made her story, her substitute family. That substitute family were the only people she let in her life so she wouldn't get hurt. So when Disney, hounded and hounded her to get her to let them make a movie out of the book; only dire need for money made her consider it.

When you are trying to make a move for American families, as Disney did it; you want fun, music, characters, fantasy, animation... But this threatened the original story and was resisted by the author, so much so that tension in the viewers of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" becomes uncomfortable. We get flashbacks to the childhood that caused the problems in the life of the author of Mary Poppins: alcoholic father ...to the point he drinks himself dead, mother falling apart, and a no-nonsense aunt to the rescue of the family.

Mr. Banks, the father in Mary Poppins is a banker, like the author's father was. Even in Mary Poppins he was not very likable...though the author idealized her own father who celebrated who she was in her childhood...even though he was an alcoholic; and discounted her own helpless mother. The trauma to the author came, because of the horrible situation and disgrace in which her father left the family. She loved him...but how could she love him? That is where the title, and the main story line of this film lies, in saving Mr. Banks, the father, in her memory...and in her story.

If you remember, at the end of Mary Poppins, Mr. Banks realizes that his family is the most important part of his life and he stops being such a prick. As the author, with the help of Disney, the writers, the environment changes the story so that Mr. Banks becomes worthy of love again, she works through her own issues to become whole again. And by doing this in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" we are all made a little more whole, a little more happy, a little more at peace with the bad things that have happened in our own lives.",1402531200,7,2364,4.477958236658933

5602697,4,B00BEIYSL4,"There was much more to this storyline then I first imagined. The significance of the title is most important, and since
I neither never read nor watched Mary Poppins, I was slow to determine who Mr. Banks was. The author's relationship with her father is also key: who he was, his addiction, his relationship with his children, his impact with the family. Anyone who has lived with an alcoholic parent can relate to some of these scenes, and the daughter's role in wanting to make him okay is heart wrenching. Disney's role (played by Tom Hanks) reveals his empathy and his own childhood challenges and how he overcame them as an adult. Emma Thompson captured all the emotions of the adult child who struggles to control and maintain the dignity of her childhood memories of her father. She really doesn't want Disney messing with her story. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for the fine acting and the poignant emotions that it evoked.",1402531200,,935,4.777777777777778

5602699,4,B00BEIYSL4,".... and I am pretty particular about my movies.  I suspect it will be more loved by folks over 40 (or 50!) than those under.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the the parts for Thompson, Hanks and Farell seemed a little over-written to make it REALLY clear where they were each coming from. I think it could have been dialed back a bit, but hey, it was a produced by Disney.
The story line was good and the supporting cast was excellent.

That being said, I watched the show with my 21 year old daughter who thought it was ""pretty good"". I on the other hand, I saw Mary Poppins as a 5 year old when it came out in theaters (and about 20 times since). She could not recall ever seeing it (we are gonna be fixing that, btw). I think this film impacted me because I knew the plot and characters of the 1964 flick. It seriously brought back a lot of memories which made me like both films that much more. Good marketing by Disney too ... I will be buying the DVD of mary Poppins as a result :-)",1402531200,,1008,4.055276381909548
5602740,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Disney's live-action wing takes a look at the difficult, complicated working conditions that led to the creation of the studio's 1964 classic, Mary Poppins. Emma Thompson succeeds memorably as P.L. Travers, the complex, seemingly-joyless British authoritarian behind the source novel, while Tom Hanks is, surprisingly, only okay as Walt Disney himself. The tough, contested relationship between these two, opposite sides of the same coin, forms the core of the story; Disney pushes to make the film uplifting and creative, while Travers fights to maintain her characters' dignity. On the surface, it's a good example of how the powers of dedication and creativity can overcome difficult circumstances to make a brilliant piece of work - perhaps one that's even better than they'd have made amidst calmer waters. I felt that the scenes inside Disney's idea factory, superficial as they proved to be, were the film's best. Writers, songsters and artists giving it their all, only to be shot down by a stubborn client on a technicality and come back for more - that's the intriguing stuff. The frequent dalliances into flashback and character moments, though effective in a classical sense, felt too formulaic and artificially sweetened for my taste. A fine enough ride, though I was hoping for something slightly more off-the-beaten-path.",1402531200,,1336,5.3364928909952605

I had no idea about the traits of Disney either.  Quite revealing.  I would give it 5 stars but there was something that didn't quite settle with me in some of the depiction in the studios.  It didn't quite feel real.  Did they really serve up those kinds of foods and behave that way? If so, then I guess it would be 5-stars for acting, but not quite, because it played just a tad slow (not by much, just a tad) in portions of the movie.

Hanks and Thompson were awesome in bringing Disney and what I saw as Julie Andrews (because she played Mary Poppins) into character for Miss Banks.  I loved Farrell's depiction of Mr. Banks and the actress for young Miss Banks.  It was tough learning about her and Mr. Banks' true demise of character, but at the same time, rewarding to see that it worked something good for others and then became Disney's  ""Mary Poppins"".

I want to read Mary Poppins now and see how differently it is depicted by the author to compare with what I remember of the movie.  Oh yes, I liked seeing the real clips at the end of the movie.  Finally, maybe I'll watch Mary Poppins again?  Who knows.",1402358400,,1259,4.302127659574468

In fact, I was a little surprised at how few clips from the Mary Poppins movie were included in this story.  Still, a very enjoyable movie and a good story.  Never would have thought about it, but Tom Hanks makes a great Walt Disney.  Emma Thompson is superb and the supporting cast is fantastic.

I was hoping that the portrayal of the author, Miss P. L. Travers was harsh so I checked Wikipedia.
Either both Disney and Wiki are Travers haters, or she really was a pathetic fool.
Yes, her Father, Travers Goff, was an alcoholic.
That could explain her pitiful life.
Frankly, I lost all charitable feelings for  her halfway through the movie.
If I were Walt Disney, I'd have thrown her out of my office and waited for her to go bankrupt and then buy the rights to the movie.

I have met people who worked with Walt Disney.  They have such an incredible respect and admiration for him.  Today, we see too many 'Presidents' come from appointments by fellow 'boys club' Board of Directors.  The only 'price' they paid to achieve their status was to suck up to the Board.  I wish for all the young people to watch and understand the glorious path of being a builder, innovator and true leader of a 'company' (which is just another word for 'people').

America needs more 'Walt Disney' types.  In November (2014 and 2016), put aside the Nanny-state and Victim-hood storyline of the liberally minded and build your own future.  Be strong.  Be conservative.  And vote for the type of 'responsibility' and 'freedom' that gave us this type of life.",1401753600,,1025,4.728813559322034

It is also 2 hours long which tends to go beyond my time tolerance for a movie! We started it late and i actually thought I would fall asleep during it.

I was so wrong! it was fantastic! It had me chuckling throughout. There were so many fun facts to learn about Walt Disney himself. Of course Tom Hanks did a great job (of that there was no doubt). Emma Thompson was wonderful- such a cranky yet lovable lady she portrayed!!

Based on the true story of Walt Disney pursuing P.L. Travers for the movie rights to her novel Mary Poppins. Except its not really about that.

What did I  think?

A truly and wonderful engaging story that warms the heart and moistens the eyes. Nominally, the story is about Disneys pursuit of Travers, but the actual story shows us the world that shaped the author. Its this side of the movie  rich in characterisation and emotion  that lifts it above an ordinary movie to make it extraordinary. Incredible performances and a wonderful story shine through even the faint tint of Disney propaganda. Dont miss it!

The movie interweaves the story of the negotiations around the film and creating the script and songs with flashbacks to Travers personal history, on which Mary Poppins drew significantly.  Since the character, Mr. Banks, is based largely on her beloved father, Travers was concerned that he be portrayed positively.  I found the film to be touching and fun, with not the least of its pleasures being Paul Giamati as the chauffeur assigned to Travers and Colin Farrell as her father in the flashbacks.",1401494400,,780,4.878787878787879

Travers, the author of the book ""Mary Poppins""....whom Walt Disney is trying to get the film rights to.  I'm not sure if there is any truth to this story...or if it is just made up.

Travers to let him make a movie based on her Mary Poppins books.  You get a good sense of why she was so reluctant to let go and you see that, sure enough, he did just about everything she didn't want him to do.

5603158,2,B00BEIYSL4,"I think for two reasons: first, don't like stories where the lead has to be explained or made acceptable by a series of flashbacks, as if her present life is not story enough; and second, the character is just unappealing and I didn't care for her, not because the writer Mrs. Travers is unappealing, but because the writers didn't make the Mrs. Travers' character interesting and appealing. I think they tried to make her sympathetic with her kindness to her driver, but the story needed a whole lot more. the story is her, and I couldn't care less about the difficulty male characters in the 1960s had in manipulating her - they wanted something and were able to get it yet the story is them complaining about how hard she made it for them - she couldn't have been that tough as Mr. Disney got the rights. the story shown is not the story I wanted to see: male characters whining about a difficult woman but ultimately getting what they want from her. every character must carry their own weight - if you're going to make a story with an unappealing character at it's center, you should have a very good reason for it. what is it about Mrs. Travers that is so valuable that a film about aspects of her life needed to be made? the story shows what motivates her writing but why is that so important it needed a film? the acting is fine, Emma Thompson is always great, and I loved the guys, just, no story. I didn't like that they made her unattractive either, why did they choose that hairstyle? I don't care if the real Mrs. Travers wore her hair like that, the character should've worn a more attractive style.  She is the story: why deliberately make her unattractive? If the filmmakers don't like or respect some aspect of her character, why make the film? I understood her writing, but not her. she needed at least one additional character in England to make her sympathetic, two would've been better. 2 and 1/2 stars. P.S Hollywood just seems to have a hard time writing middle age women. it is just not that hard to present a sexy, capable, intelligent middle age woman character who does not intimidate male characters, as if men cannot deal with anyone who doesn't kowtow to them or who isn't a love interest for them. Hollywood needs to get a clue on presenting more interesting middle age women characters.",1401408000,,2318,4.545454545454546

5603232,4,B00BEIYSL4,"... a very engaging movie with some excellent acting from Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson.  A fine screenplay that brings out the character of Walt Disney's Midwestern charm, wisdom and business acumen.  (He was, after all the creator of a magic kingdom.)  And Ms. Thompson's character, a curmudgeonly British spinster, Pamela Travers, who happened to have created one of the most famous children's books of all time, was played flawlessly. Although the movie, ""Mary Poppins,"" was a hit, and Disney and Travers are portrayed as burying the hatchet in this dramatization, in actuality Ms. Travers refused to allow Disney to make any further movies about her character.  Pamela Travers was in fact a very enigmatic woman and her portrayal in this screenplay is limited in scope.  It is an entertaining movie but could have been so much more if Pamela Travers had received a broader treatment in the screenplay.  Or perhaps we need another movie about the real Pamela Travers. In any case, I will not quibble as I enjoyed ""Saving Mr. Banks"" and recommend it.",1401148800,,1051,4.943181818181818

I wasn't impressed with her but her story was good. I found it her to be a very dark person. The Disney writers were awesome. I have loved the music of  the film since the first time I saw Mary Poppins. It was interesting to see how devoted P.L. Travers was to her father.

Saving Mr. Banks had plenty of conflict, and the conflict occurred between two fascinating characters. I would rate the movie high for a film about writers and a good drama across all genres.

There was a line in the movie that caught my attention. A one point, Tom Hanks, as Walt Disney says, Because that's what we storytellers do. We restore order with imagination.

Walt Disney truly was a pioneer. Considering when Mary Poppins was made, the combination of animation and special effects for that movie was pretty amazing, perhaps a first of its kind. The music in Mary Poppins, just like in most Disney movies, were so catchy. ""A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down...""

Yes it is about The writer of Mary Poppins fighting Disney every step of the way as he struggled to make the movie but more importantly it is about the truths in the novel Mary Poppins and how it corresponded with her childhood.

5603288,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Academy Award nominations: Original Score

March Boy awards: Picture, Director-John Lee Hancock, Leading Actor-Tom Hanks, Leading Actress-Emma Thompson, Supporting Actor-Colin Farrell, Supporting Actress-Ruth Wilson, Screenplay, Cinematography, Costume Design and Set Design.

I am thrilled to have seen Saving Mr. Banks. I cannot in good conscience think of a single flaw in it. John Lee Hancock's direction is simply flawless. Every sequence is brilliantly shot and well-staged and he bring out the best in every single actor--even Ginty the secretary was good. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking not only in its scope but in the rich, warm shades of earthy colors: brown, tan, gold, green, gray and sepia. The screenplay is terrific. There is not a single false note, not a drop of corniness, not one wasted line; everything is brief, concise and to the point with all dialogues relative to the conflict (Walt Disney trying to get Pamela Travers' approval) and the inspiration for the book. (Pamela's childhood)

I will never understand why Emma Thompson was not nominated for Best Leading Actress of 2013. She pulls off Pamela's eccentrities and shrill, annoying, cantankerous antics effortlessly and even though I knew beforehand she was eventually going to soften into a more kind, gentle woman it develops so slowly and gradually that it feel real. My favorite of her scenes is when the Sherman Brothers are playing ""Let's go fly a kite."" At first she taps her feet to the rhythm. Then she smiles and sways a little. Then BOOM! The secretary dashes into Walt Dinsey's office exclaiming. ""YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS!!! You're not going believe it! She's SINGING and DANCING with them!!!"" And that look on her face as she tries to hold back her tears at the premiere was absolutely unforgettable.

Tom Hanks completely melts into the charming, charismatic persona of Walt Disney. His best scene is where he goes to visit Pamela towards the end. He drops the Mr. Smiley act and comes down to earth when he tells her about his abusive childhood to assure her, she's not the only person who's been dealt hard cards.

Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson are outstanding in portraying the agony and suffering of Pamela's parents in the flashbacks--especially Wilson. I kid you not, I had never read the plot summary of the movie but when Wilson went into Pamela' room and said ""I know you gave him the whiskey. I'm not mad at you. Take care of your sisters."" From the resonance in her low, husky voice on the ""Take care of your sisters."" I simply KNEW she was going to end it all, or at least try to.

My favorite scenes are:

1. Pamela rescuing her mother in the lake.
2. Pamela hugging Mickey Mouse in bed, a foreshadowment of how she's slowly learning to drop her `chip on a shoulder' mannerisms.
3. One of the Sherman brothers drawing a picture of her yelling ""No! No! No!""
4. Walt Disney giving her a ride on the carousel. The look on her face as she's riding side saddle is PRICELESS.
I highly recommend this movie. Very moving and inspiring.",1401062400,,3049,4.863198458574181

It wasn't gripping or heart-stopping but it was interesting and entertaining. I learned some things about Walt I didn't know.  Hanks didn't quite sound like Walt but had I not had all of those  Wonderful World of Disney television shows to compare him to he would have sounded ok.  Not quite fare  enough o hold today's addled youth spellbound but it is a fairly good movie with a plot, no violence and several twists to disclose Walt as actually human and not animatronic.

A genuinely  caring individual whose strong will saw him into his dream. Thank you to Walt for that .

AND the others aren't too shabby either ....... Tom Hanks is picture, posture perfect as 'WD' - a gentle but determined mogul - with 'simply oodles' of patience ....... somewhat surrounded by his Creative Trio [Bradley Whitford, B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman]  - fine, fine performances!  Not forgetting Paul Giametti [the bashful chauffeur] and Kathy Baker as the Secretary/Assistant to ""WD"".  [Rachel Griffiths makes a delightful cameo appearance as a sort of deus-ex-machina].

BUT EMMA THOMPSON ..... the divine Ms. Thompson sparkles with caustic - yet not offensive wit.  A BRILLIANT creation without affectation.  What a pleasure it is to see this Lady on screen ... making everything so effortless and charming ....  Her character's 'adjustment' [?] to the informal business attitude of the Movie Industry is a delight to watch - similarly explored in ""My Week with Marilyn"".

It's a wonderful period piece of the early sixties set in the not too different Tinseltown it is today .... there are still those endless and mind numbing meetings that seem to go nowhere ... then the catering thats always there but seldom touched - mere disposable props ..... and all that 'talking at each other' instead of 'communicating'.

For the neophyte  - this is Quite a realistic glimpse into the creative world of Hollywood.

Mr Hanks and Ms. Thompson spar delightfully and never really come to blows - it's a growing experience for both characters.

Art direction, Costume Design [Daniel Orlandi] are all superb ....... it's a wonderful companion piece to the original ""Mary Poppins"".

5603520,3,B00BEIYSL4,"PL Travers was not a happy woman.  She had an unhappy childhood, as an adult she was bisexual and constantly looking for some person to be in love with, without having much love to give in return.  In this whole hoopla about the movie Saving Mr. Banks. at no point, did Travers have any comment to make about the lady who was portraying her much loved character/idol.  Largely, I suspect because Mary Poppins as a character didn't really mean much to Travers.  The control of Mary Poppins is what she cared about.  Travers separated twin brothers and only adopted one because her astrologer said so. She was the ultimate control freak, and the Disney franchise pried some of that control away from her, and put it in the hands of a kinder gentler control freak, Walt Disney.  I've read all of the books, and I think Julie Andrews got the character dead on. Spit spot, if you will.",1400544000,,880,4.537974683544304

The real Walt Disney always appeared quiet and laid back whereas Hanks comes off pushy, overbearing, and full of himself.  Emma Thompson is a very good actress but her talents did not shine in this film.  The background story of how Mary Poppins came to be was interesting and the actors in the flashbacks and background story good but disjointed and could have been expanded upon much more effectively.  It is a ""family film"" meaning any age can watch it without language or sexual concerns but the story line is too adult for children, I don't think they would understand it, and not sufficiently entertaining for adults.

It's funny, heart warming, tragic in parts, and ultimately satisfying at the ending.

5603551,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I'm ""rounding up"" my 3.5 star rating due to the solid performances by Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell.  In my opinion, the movie is worth seeing simply to enjoy and appreciate their acting ""chops.""  Despite being a Disney movie about the making of the Mary Poppins film, this is a movie for adults.  The content is developmentally mature, dealing with issues such as alcohol addiction, depression, loss, suppressed self-blame, etc.  Two stories unfold.  The first is the wooing of PL Travers to sell film rights of her book to Disney, and the subsequent understanding and compassion the film team has towards the thoroughly obnoxious, temperamental demands said author.  The second parallel story unfolds in flashback scenes from the perspective of this confounding lady, scenes of her childhood and the joy and difficulty of her both gentle, loving, yet alcohol-driven unpredictable and confusing father - - memories which shed light on the seemingly over-the-top demands Travers makes on the film team working to make her happy in hopes they can produce Mary Poppins.  The story was fascinating, yet definitely dragged throughout the movie.  Thompson disappeared in her role, she became the complex woman who is PL Travers, so much so that I found myself frustrated with her (no remnant of Eleanor or Beatrice from Sense and Sensibility or Much Ado About Nothing remained in my thoughts while watching her in this movie).  Farrell captivated and haunted in his role as an alcoholic man who loved his family, but struggled with depression and couldn't resist the destruction of his addiction.  My mother-in-law saw this movie and told me Tom Hanks played Disney quite accurately to the memory she had when she met him at the age of nine.  And I also really enjoyed the performances of Ruth Wilson (PL Travers' mother) and Paul Giamatti (driver for PL Travers when she visits LA to meet with Disney).

If you have time, and there aren't any movies you are dying to see that are waiting for you, this movie is well worth a viewing simply for the acting of several of the cast alone.  The story is quite fascinating as well, although loses some of its appeal by being just a little too plodding.",1400544000,,2193,4.894594594594595

Tom and Emma shared equally I think in their wonderful portrayal of interesting people, Walt and Mrs. Travers.  P.L.

When I was impressed to buy the movie 'Saving Mr. Banks', I had no idea what the movie was about...it just felt right and I like Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson as actors.

It turned out to be an excellent decision. It is a wonderful story, behind-the-story. It takes viewers into the private lives of (and dynamics created by ) two people combining forces to make the movie, Mary Poppins, possible. Their deep connection to family rattles bones of the past but, in such a way as to give the story depth.

I can imagine how the Disney staff reacted to her, as Mr. Sherman has related recently.  The acting was superb on the parts of Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, and I can see how badly she felt by needing to act prickly. I'll just rewatch ""Mary Poppins""  and try not to think of this movie.",1400457600,,442,4.176470588235294
5603677,5,B00BEIYSL4,The casting was superb.  The acting was fanastic and the reminiscing during the movie to capture the emotion of the moment was perfect.  I had no idea how much effort went into creating the Mary Poppins Masterpiece.  No wonder it is an enduring classic.

5603681,4,B00BEIYSL4,The movie is about the lady that wrote Mary Poppins (which Walt read to his daughters) and his desire to have writes to make it into a movie.

It's bitter sweetness was not overwhelming but just enough,Since I'd already liked the lead female actress plus the chauffeur I'd known ahead of time it would be delightful & wasn't disappointing. Then the actor in the character role of the lead actress shown as a child off & on you put the pieces of the puzzle together, I imparticularly enjoyed the beauty of the opening narrative.",1400457600,,500,4.758620689655173

This storyline took place when I was a little girl and the scenes of Disneyland and of Walt Disney really brought back fond memories.  There is a scene where the characters in the film go into Disneyland and I cried my eyes out, because I was so moved to see good, old Disneyland just like it was when I went there for the first time at 8 years old.  I enjoyed everything about this movie - it was great!",1400371200,,471,4.043010752688172

A nice movie for family to watch.  I actually went to the movies to see this show and then had to purchase it for my collection when it came out in DVD.",1400371200,,298,4.0
5603733,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Couldn't wait to see it at the pictures, and then buy the DVD.  Couldn't fault any of it, and as like most movies, every time I see it, I pick up on something I missed.  My 12 year old daughter, who repeatedly said she had no interest in the movie, sat down and enjoyed the whole thing when I asked her to watch the first 10 minutes.  It's very moving, and also makes you want to holiday at Disneyland again.  I could watch it over and over.

A fantastic movie with no nudity, sex, swearing or crudeness!!!",1400371200,,506,4.175257731958763
5603734,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This is a classic Disney story and most people will definitely enjoy it. Go in with the idea of it  being a Disney story and you won't be disappointed.

5603759,5,B00BEIYSL4,New insight into the world of Walt Disney and the history behind the movie Mary Poppins.  Tom Hanks did a wonderful job with the character of Walt Disney.  P.L. Travers is one strange bird and Emma Thompson was spot on.  There was not anything about this movie that I did not love.  The scenes were time appropriate as well.  I was very touched by P.L. Travers childhood portrayal.  Great movie!,1400284800,,395,4.571428571428571
5603760,4,B00BEIYSL4,"The highlight of this movie to me was the incredible performance Tom Hanks provided as Walt Disney.  He had *everything* down:  The mannerisms, the vocal inflections, and the attitude.  A really perfect performance.  The main problem with the movie was that he just wasn't in the movie enough!  The ""B"" plot which delved into the past of the author of the Mary Poppins books took up a good 30-40% of the movie.  I understand that those flashbacks were crucial to understanding why the adult author acted the way she did around Disney.  But it seemed to me that those scenes could have been condensed by half.  Other than that, this movie is a real treat for all fans of Disney in general and the Mary Poppins movie in particular.  Oh and the Blu-ray A/V quality is outstanding!",1400284800,,777,4.613138686131387

5603764,5,B00BEIYSL4,A wonderful story of how Marry Poppins came to be...Not how it was made. Walt Disney played wonderfully by Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson plays the brilliant role of the creator of the classic.,1400284800,,190,4.617647058823529
5603765,5,B00BEIYSL4,I HAVE NEVER rated a show on Amazon with 5 stars.  This movie has broken that streak.  Will be a timeless classic. How ironic that it tells the back story of another timeless classic!!!!!!!,1400198400,,189,4.529411764705882

5603798,3,B00BEIYSL4,"While the film works on a moment to moment basis, (except for the too frequent and often unjustified flashbacks,) it essentially posits that writers are damaged people who can only be redeemed by facile yet god-like filmmakers. It's hilarious how none of her concerns are addressed or given any weight. Travers is just steam-rolled by Disney and her own personal development. But if you don't really think about it, it's a well-done couple of hours for fans of Mary Poppins.",1400198400,,474,4.9375

5603801,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This is an excellent family movie.  If you are a Disney fan, you will love it.  I chose it for two reasons.  I love most anything Disney.  I grew up watching ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" on TV.  Our daughter grew up with Disney.  She now has triplets who also love Disney.  I think between the two of us, we probably have almost all Disney movies either on tape, dvd, or blue-ray.  I purchased this movie for our triplets' birthday.  They were so excited!  I would recommend this movie for all family members.",1400198400,,504,4.380434782608695

5603803,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Walt Disney and author P.L. Travers both created alter egos that not only had traits of their creators, but became almost as emotionally important to them as an actual child. Disney created Mickey Mouse in the 1920s, and was the voice for Mickey in the earliest talking cartoons, beginning in 1928. Disney continued in this capacity through the late 1940s, providing the familiar falsetto voice of his most famous creation. Helen Goff, writing under the pen name of P. L. Travers, created the magical nanny Mary Poppins, a character closely identified with Goff's traumatic childhood in Australia.

These two obsessive creative personalities, Disney and Travers, waged a quiet twenty-year battle over the film rights to Travers' Mary Poppins. Finally Disney prevailed after a personal visit by Travers to California, which is the principle storyline of this film. In 1964 the enormously successful film starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke was released to great acclaim. Saving Mr. Banks recounts this contest of wills, and features frequent flashbacks to Goff's childhood, with her memories of her beloved but chronically alcoholic banker father, and her distracted mother trying to raise three children in remote rural Australia. The Mary Poppins inspiration was Goff's maternal aunt, whose stern presence was summoned in an attempt to save ""Mr. Banks"", otherwise known as Travers Goff, father of ""P.L. Travers"".

Saving Mr. Banks is an enjoyable and moving film experience, combining as it does a good story that has some elements familiar to almost everyone, and a superb cast led by Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P. L. Travers. Notable among the many fine performances is that of Colin Farrell as the loving, talented, but self-destructive Travers Goff. Paul Giamatti, one of Hollywood's most versatile and believable actors, puts in an emotionally subtle performance as the chauffeur assigned to Mrs. Travers during her stay in Los Angeles.

The agonies of the screenwriting crew in dealing with the notoriously difficult Travers are shown in some detail. If you watch to the end of the credits, you will hear a few minutes of an actual fifty-year-old recording of one of the brainstorming and bargaining sessions between Travers and Disney's story and music-writing personnel.",1400112000,7,2303,5.252717391304348
5603804,5,B00BEIYSL4,"All the preceding superlatives apply, underscored.  The very stunning Emma Thompson's performance could only be surpassed if the producers had been able to get Julie Andrews to play the Travers role.  Thank about that.  Would that have been a twist and a treat?

But the entire cast was excellent, and the setting authentic 1963ish.  The writers slipped a few times with contemporary expressions that were not in use then, but never mind -- a great film for anyone who has first seen ""Mary Poppins"" and remembers Walt Disney for the great he was!",1400112000,3,546,4.827956989247312
5603805,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Best DVD of the year in my opinion, gives a good all around foundation of who Walt Disney was, and behind the making of Mary Poppins and the author's family history that Mary Poppins is based on.  Very moving movie, for your entire family.  As young as 9 years old loved the movie and watched Mary Poppins in a whole new light!",1400112000,,327,4.258064516129032

5603827,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I usually avoid films highly rated by pros as too much hype or as odd stories, but with two favorite actors in lead roles I wanted to see this on . I wasn't disappointed. Tom Hanks and Emma Thomson are brilliant, and the rest of the slim cast handle their roles beautifully.

It definitely is not a Disney movie made for children or even for family viewing, unless you are ready for a lengthy discussion of the issues it raises. For adults, it is a well written and well acted story tying three cultures together - rural Australia of the 30's, stiff and proper England of the 70's, and an optimistic and materialistic US of the 70's. Yet its magic is in the way it replaces the story we know so well - Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" - with the true story of writer P.L. Travers childhood. As she watches her creation, the Mary Poppins stories, being recast in frivolous ways, especially (gasp!) with animation, it raises more than the hairs on the back of her neck. But Travers too has recast the difficult truth in her own stories. In the end it is Disney's reminder that ""This is what we story tellers do. We restore order with imagination. We instill hope again and again"" that wins her over and allows the Mary Poppins movie to be made.",1400112000,,1233,4.431718061674009

We both agreed that the Disney movie absolutely did not represent the books. But I was curious to see the dynamics between the author and Walt Disney. My husband fell in love with the entire film We were both crying throughout the story, especially the flashbacks to Australia. We both thought Colin Farrell's performance was deeply touching and his work with the little girl playing his daughter realistic and wonderfully performed.

This movie is a must see piece of work for anybody who like me enjoyed with innocence Mary Poppins....and who later without that much innocence of a child...had the pleasure to share it with my own kids for them to enjoy from that beautiful purity that only kids have.
This is the reality behind Mary Poppins, and it makes it again beautiful and believable in its own magic for what it was.

Enjoy!",1399939200,,788,4.397260273972603

5603995,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Movie is more about the life and personal childhood experiences of the author that shaped the Mary Poppins book and characters than about the making of the movie itself.  If you are looking for a lot of Mary Poppins content, you will be disappointed.  However the shaping of the authors life, combined with her own personal demons, and Walt Disney's quest to have her share her book in the form of a move, lead all to a better understanding of themselves.",1399939200,,455,4.604938271604938

Loved the movie - I had to look up some details because I didn't think it was true - but it seems it was very well done in order to tell the story of both the author and how the movie was made.  Sometimes Hollywood just gets it right.,1399852800,,391,3.642857142857143

5604042,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I guess I listened to the hype too much because I found the movie to be tiresome and a little bit irritating at times.  I never fully understood why Emma Thompson character demanded the utmost respect and good manners when she, herself, treated people  horribly. There seemed to be a lack of balance between the judgmental author and easy going ""Walt"".  The way she refused to call him Walt, after many requests to do so, made her rude and overbearing...not ""proper"".  The movie would have been more enjoyable for me if they had showed her to be more human than rude.
I was sorry I didn't like it any better than I did as I am a Disney fan and have enjoyed both actors in other movies.",1399852800,,685,4.3700787401574805

I won't say much because I don't want to give any of the story away, but any fan of Mary Poppins MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Even if you're not a huge fan but you've at least seen Mary Poppins, you have to see this.

5604083,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I loved the movie but VERY disappointed in the sound.  The first 3/4 of the movie was garbled and almost impossible to understand.  It would come on loud and then so low you couldn't hear. Finally, it cleared up and could understand really well.  That was a lot of money for something I couldn't understand.  I think I should get a refund.",1399766400,,339,4.419354838709677

5604127,3,B00BEIYSL4,I saw the film in the theater and loved it.  Couldn't wait for the DVD hoping there would be some commentary or behind-the-scenes info to complete the story.  All you get is one deleted scene.  When the film came out the Disney website had interviews with the cast and a bit on the recording of the soundtrack.  None of that made it to the DVD.  BUT the film is worth purchasing.,1399766400,,379,4.28169014084507

5604154,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I was blown away by this beautiful, intelligent, sensitive film. In a sense, this is a detective story in which we are given a series of clues about the psychological roots of the conflict between Walt Disney and the author of Mary Poppins. First of all, the screenplay was simply outstanding. The story, which I understand deviated somewhat from the facts (and I don't care), brought me right in and kept me there. Character development was excellent. The two leads were fabulous. Emma Thompson was amazing in this role and was matched by Tom Hanks. His character was more subtle but Hanks was mesmerizing as Disney, especially in the scene where he describes his painful childhood. Colin Farrell, in a supporting role, gives a sensitive performance that surprised me. The director, John Lee Hancock, is someone to watch. I really was not expecting so much from this film. A wonderful surprise!",1399766400,,895,4.933774834437086
5604155,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I grew up loving Walt Disney. I love Tom Hanks performance. Emma Thompson was great and gave a performance that deserved more recognition. The advertisements for the film really did not due justice to its dramatic side. There is a picture within a picture that was great in itself. Paul Giametti plays a role that was really endearing. There was so much I loved about this, brought tears to my eyes. Miss Walt. Watch it.",1399680000,,420,4.613333333333333

5604157,5,B00BEIYSL4,"The story is not what we expected - but enjoyed it nontheless.  Walt Disney was a wonderful person of character and how he handled Ms. P.L. Travers was superb.  I've not read the book, Mary Poppins, but am inspired to do so.",1399680000,,224,4.309523809523809
5604158,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Really enjoyed the movie.  Emma Thompson is wonderful playing Mrs. Travis.  My problem is with Amazon.  When we ordered up the film, we received a message that it wasn't available.  So we tried again and the second time it went through just fine.  Trouble is that I was charged twice for the movie that we actually watched just once.  I tried to contact Amazon via e-mail to correct this situation, but could not find a place to put forth such a request.  So here I am putting it in a review of the movie.  Hate to do this, since I truly love Amazon, but I hate to be out $5.99 as well.  JW",1399680000,,590,4.150442477876106

5604163,5,B00BEIYSL4,I was expecting a light-hearted movie about Mr. Disney working with a difficult woman. What I got was a trip through a complicated Father/Daughter relationship. Excellent film that touched me deeply.,1399593600,2,199,5.451612903225806
5604174,2,B00BEIYSL4,"This movie had all the makings of a fun evening.  However it was so depressing.  There were flashes of fun and enjoyment but it fell flat with me.  I thought the acting was good and I enjoyed each character but not the story.  This is definitely not a movie for children.  In fact, the movie just made me sad.  Not what I expected it to be.",1399593600,,340,4.075757575757576

5604177,5,B00BEIYSL4,very strong movie - but may not appeal to everyone - it explains through the subjects childhood the theme of the story,1399593600,,118,4.409090909090909
5604178,5,B00BEIYSL4,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I've always been a fan of the Mary Poppins movie. Saving Mr Banks was a great story on its own and very interesting for a perspective on the making of the Disney classic. I especially liked that the script didn't completely gloss over the foibles of the characters of Walt Disney or R.L. Travers.,1399507200,3,341,4.516129032258065

The movie stars perform as you expect they will but I get the impression that it wasn't partuclarly a creative stretch for Tom Hanks- gven some of his other more challenging work and performances.  What I am trying to say is that most anyone could have played Walt Disney for this one.. I presume that Hanks was used for the box office draw.. because the story- while interesting, wouldnt be a huge draw by itself.",1399507200,,626,4.434782608695652

A surprising appearance and excellent performance by Colin Farrell.  The film was well-cast, and since I lived through that era, I want to say that the period setting was done extremely well.

Started kind slow (for me anyways) but then the characters starts to build and next thing you know your sucked right in.  I truly enjoyed this film.  I felt it was heart warming and had a very good message.  Loved the part where she gives the driver a list of famous deceased people with accomplished great things and they each had a disability.  Anyways if you are feeling down and need something to pick you right back up on your feet; I recommend this movie.  If you enjoyed this movie I also recommend Secret Life of Walter Mitty.

5604312,5,B00BEIYSL4,Emma Thompson was superb. I liked the juxtaposition to her characters past story and how it tied to the  character of Mary Popins. It provided some rich history both to her and to Walt Disney. It was a far better screen play than I expected with more depth that the trailers projected. It was a pleasant surprise and well worth seeing.,1399248000,,335,4.491803278688525
5604363,5,B00BEIYSL4,"The inspiring story of how the book, ""Mary Poppins"" was allowed to be written for film and produced by Walt Disney Co. is very interesting and touching. Two very creative individuals (P.L.Travers and Walt Disney) had to find something in common for the book's story to be told on film. They finally found commonality in their individual childhood experiences. Though they didn't achieve a friendship, they did learn to respect each other. Travers came to understand how Disney overcame his childhood troubles by reaching above negative thoughts and finding comfort in the love of all things good. Disney came to understand that Travers' personal connection with her book helped her come to terms with the profound losses she suffered in childhood. She believed that to give up the book was to give up her ability to cope. But, as each realized how the other had overcome great odds, they began to compromise without making each other give up what each valued. And, when Travers realized that Disney finally grasped the central point of the story, she gave her consent for the film to proceed. Both also found imagination to be a great tool to help overcome insurmountable odds.",1399248000,,1177,4.94949494949495

5604367,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Well done movie. Very impressed at the acting from Colin Ferrell. Just enough detail to bring the author to life, but not too many that would bore someone who hadn't seen Mary Poppins. A full knowledge of the movie ""Mary Poppins"" isn't needed. There is a lot of dialogue that is soft so paying attention to every part is important because many subtle comments/statements play to the larger storyline.",1399248000,,400,4.811594202898551

5604414,5,B00BEIYSL4,"An excellent and thoroughly warmhearted movie that all ages can enjoy. I have seen almost every Tom Hanks movie, and this ties for his best role, along with his roles in ""Splash"" and ""Big.""
People's biggest gripe with this film seem to be their sense of its ""in accuracy."" That's just silly, when the same people flock to ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""The Dark Knight"" without nearly so much fuss about realism. (Note: I am a Spider-Man and Batman fan, too.) That being said, the gist of this movie is based on a real set of events: P.L. Travers authors the beloved Mary Poppins books. Walt Disney learns of these books and attempts to convince Travers to sign over the movie rights for the next 20 years. She eventually does, but not without making it a laborious process.
Some people have pointed to the fact that the movie does not mention Travers was a mother. However, she does in fact allude to this in one scene. (She was estranged from her adopted son in real life.) Did Disney really have the touching heart-to-heart with Travers about why he wants to redeem Mr. Banks? Not exactly in the way the movie sets it, but there was clearly an understanding of what the father figure represented for both of them. Don't let the naysayers stop you from enjoying this wonderful film. It was shameful that Hanks and (the always fantastic) Emma Thompson were not nominated for Oscars for their fine performances. (And for that matter, Colin Firth was very good, too.)",1399248000,,1455,4.6434108527131785

5604417,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This is a very difficult Movie to review because it is actually a dual review.  On the one hand you are reviewing the story line, character development, and acting and on the other hand you are reviewing what the movie can do to your perceptions.  So, first to the movie aspect of the review:

All of the actors in this movie did a superb job transporting the audience into a real tear jerker of a story.  There is no way around the fact that this story tells a very compelling human drama and then deals with how we adjust our emotional stability and preservation of memories by trying to recast things in a better light.

From an informational standpoint, this movie does an excellent job of showing some of the challenges that converting a book into a movie can entail and how the challenges of life can be transported into an uplifting fictional version of life.

For all of the above, I would definitely rate this movie a 5 star.  So, why is it only a 4 star?  Frankly, it is because it changes one's perspective about a treasured movie and shows us how different reality and story telling can be.  Saying more would take away from the movie and I will not do that.  I will simply say that had I known what was in this film, I probably would have passed on viewing it.",1399161600,,1273,4.3559322033898304
5604418,1,B00BEIYSL4,I foudn the story to be not at all believealble.  I also thought the acting was not very good.  I am not that much of a fan of movie musicals and didn't expect this to be one.  I thought the charcters were superficial.,1399161600,,218,4.023255813953488
5604419,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I already am a fan of Mary Poppins, so this was a no-brainer to watch.  Adding Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks to the cast was fantastic!  I hope they do other movies together!  The backstory was interesting and emotional.  This was to me more of a classic Disney film instead of one that is solely for hype.  Definitely worth watching - IMO definitely worth having a personal copy to watch again.",1399161600,,393,4.47887323943662
5604420,5,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"", a journey to the production of the Mary Poppins movie gives great insight into the story, the workings and the mission of Walt Disney.

Not only were Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson fabulous, which is to be expected from them both, but the supporting actors' characters were very well defined, and one had the sense that they were real, and that you were right there in the room with them.

I did not see Mary Poppins when it came around, and if I did, I can't see how it would have helped me to like this film.  With the sterling cast that this movie has, one would expect something that could really be entertaining.  I was more befuddled than entertained.  Bear with my quirks, but I still can't believe that a very charming Australian child could mature into a persnickety English, frumpy Miss that Ms. Thompson played so well.  For one moment when her character let her hair down and enjoyed the process of transforming her written material into the musical this film is based on, was a stretch for me to believe.  No one can become human suddenly,  then return to such a disagreeable state in a heartbeat.  Colin Farrell, good in so many other roles, was miscast, or just unable to portray a convincing character, and his relationship with his young daughter was sort of creepy.",1398902400,,1044,4.605405405405405

If nothing else, this movie will make you go out and watch Mary Poppins again. I did not realize what the roots of the story behind this movie were. I was a kid when I saw it in the Theaters and never saw it again. I didn't know it was originally a book written by such a ""tight-lipped, cold feet"" British female author and was never intended to be a childrens story.

No spoilers here. Watch this movie if you are looking for something rich in character and powerful, and based on actual events.

I couldn't help to wonder how such a person could ever write such a wonderful movie as Mary Popins ! things become clear and all fit together  towards the end.

5604827,5,B00BEIYSL4,"If you are looking for a classic Hanks / Disney feel good movie then you might be a little disappointed, Emma pulled off the next Nurse Cratchit in creating a character with virtually no likable features and it was a wonderful performance as long as you are not expecting Mary Poppins. Oddly, I really liked that and I heard that was the toned down version of the woman.

Hanks was pretty good also but I don't think he was in enough scenes to really get the full Hanks experience, when he was on camera he classic Hanks, but Walt Disney was not nearly the ""nice guy"" portrayed, I can forgive that, his guys made this movie so fair enough and it hit his 50's / 60's persona to a tee from The Wonderful World Of Disney intro's he used to do..

The back-story seemed a bit rough and in many parts did not blend in the with the story at all, did not support her nasty disposition, which was more of a spoiled brat who had everyone by the short hairs and knew it. It does explain to some degree her ugly disposition but not nearly as well as the more likely reason is that she had been living fat off of the royalties from the books and when that dried up was not about to give up her life style but hated having to give anything up. You can catch a glimpse of that if you ignore the intended backstory message.",1398643200,,1307,4.182539682539683
5604828,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I know that I was supposed to hate this, but I honestly spent two hours last night crying, smiling and falling madly in love with Saving Mr. Banks.  Sure, it is a flawed film, in more ways than one, and the overt sentimentality of it all is sure to rub people the wrong way, and is one of those things that I have been known to criticize in other films, and yet there was something so pure and utterly enjoyable about every frame here that I couldn't help but feel a deep swell of affection for this film, from start to finish.

It doesnt hurt that Mary Poppins is one of my favorite films of all time.  But then again, who doesnt absolutely melt for that cinematic masterpiece.  The perfect blend of wit and charm coupled with a real emotional burst and some splendid life lessons, Mary Poppins is a magical and perfect representation of what Disney stood for and continues to stand for.

A film about the collaborative creation of that big screen classic is daunting, for sure.

Im going to get the bad out of the way, because to me it is a little thing when taken into the context of the film.  Walt Disney was, as far as most accounts and records would indicate, a very selfish and reprehensible man.  He was a business man and a BS artist and had some unsavory political (or social) views and he was not a well thought of man, even by his employees.  He was a hard man to be around.  Saving Mr. Banks portrays him in the same golden light that his company has tried to cast him under since the very beginning.  Now, normally this would be a big detractor for me, but the truth of the matter is that this film is not about Walt Disney.  He is a supporting character and has marginal screen time, and the fact that he was desperate for a piece of Poppins pie has me hedging bets that he probably put his best foot forward during the time in question here.

Still, it did feel like a real sugarcoating of the man, especially in his alone scenes, and made me wonder if Disney was the right studio to put out this movie.

That being said, Disney really does make this movie so magical, so maybe they were the right studio.  Like I said, this movie isn't even about Disney, and so having him be a faade isn't a huge deal.  This movie is about P.L. Travers and her struggle to share her world, that repressed past that lies behind her masterpiece, and as such Saving Mr. Banks soars.  While some have balked that this film portrayed Travers as an unsavory woman, I don't agree.  She was prickly, yes, but she was also softened, and Emma Thompson is so remarkable (more on her in a minute) that she makes this woman so endearing and likable, despite her short fuse and sharp words.

The film cuts between Travers childhood and her battle with Disney over the film rights to her book.  As the film progresses, and Travers goes in and out of her head, we see how the world of Mary Poppins was a form of escape that mirrored her own troubled childhood.

But this is what I really loved about this movie.  Instead of going to easy, melodramatic route and giving us the expected overbearing depression of life with an alcoholic father and a suicidal mother (because Travers had both those things), Saving Mr. Banks paints these issues with a deft hand and actually softens its blows, creating a film that feels light on its feet, never bogged down by the weight of its contents, and yet never feels slight either.  The relationship between Travers and her father plays a central role here, creating a story about fathers and their mistakes and the daughters who love them and are left to pick up the pieces, and it does so in a way that feels authentic and soulful.  A lot of this is due to Colin Farrells heartwarming performance as Travers father.  The portrayal of her father as an imperfect man, and not a soulless monster, was a really nice twist from the norm and gave a complexity to the film I didn't expect.

I honestly felt this was going to be a clich&eacute;d fluff film, and I almost passed on seeing this altogether because of that assumption.

For me, this film lives and breathes in the marvelous performance given by Emma Thompson.  She is such a delightful breath of fresh air here.  She nails the biting sarcasm and prickly demeanor of Travers, and grabs hold of you from her very first scene, but it is in the warmer notes that her performance really shines.  Both of the Lets Go Fly a Kite scenes left me in a puddle of tears, especially the first one (her foot movement, her delightful exuberance) and it was in that complete transformation that she won me over.

The entire ensemble is great, with Giamatti, Novak, Whitford, Schwartzman and a young Annie Rose Buckley making delightful turns.  Hanks is a superb Disney, despite the white washing (and the horrible eye makeup that makes him look like hes either Asian or had a botched facelift in certain angles) and makes the most out of his big confession scene (cue waterworks).

This is not a popular opinion, I know.  I had a similar reaction to the maligned The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, but I cant help it.  Saving Mr. Banks won me over with its heart and soul, which it most certainly has.  What a tremendous year Disney just had!",1398643200,2,5205,4.436382754994742

Saving Mr. Banks whisks the viewer straight back to the conception of Mary Poppins,right through the production, head on into the finished movie.

It allows us a view of the childhoods of both of them and how they were shaped into the adults they became. Growing up is no easier than growing old, since both include loss and the need to overcome the losses. This movie shows us both ends of the spectrum for these very real people in a most touching way.",1398556800,,400,4.207792207792208

In fact I wanted to live in that movie! I must admit I was not inclined to even return for a visit to the books!
Hanks and Thompson are magic in themselves. They captured their roles exquisitely.  I was moved to tears..

5605048,5,B00BEIYSL4,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Two of may favorite actors put together to pull off an endearing performance of the issues with adapting books to the big screen.  Emma clearly understood the reticence of P.L. Travers to have her book developed by a 'cartoonist' .,1398384000,,265,4.866666666666666
5605049,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I saw this movie originally in the theater, loved it, and rented it through Amazon to show my family. They loved it, too. We're all Mary Poppins fans, so we were poised to enjoy it anyway, but the acting, the performances of classic Disney songs and Thomas Newman's excellent original score all made it irresistible.

As far as that acting goes, Emma Thompson is a wonder as the prickly, guarded, sometimes outright nasty PL Travers, nursing her scars and wounds like valuable jewels. Tom Hanks seemed miscast to me when I heard he would play Disney - he doesn't really look like him - but he had me completely from the moment he said ""Walt, now you've gotta call me Walt"" and only got better, showing the depths of a man who wants everyone - and that means everyone - to have a good time, but is also very used to getting exactly what he wants. Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, Kathy Baker, Jason Schwarzman and BJ Novak are also wonderful.

Yes, it takes some liberties, and softens Travers' reaction to the finished film (in reality she never warmed to it, though she did like Julie Andrews in the title role and some of the songs) and only allowed the stage musical to proceed if it had no Americans involved. But if you can put that aside, it's a delightful movie.",1398384000,,1284,4.530172413793103
5605050,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I enjoy Tom Hanks Movies.  I Know it's politically incorrect to criticize Tom Hanks or give any movie in which he stars less than a four out of five,  but he did not play that convincing a role.

Having grown up watching Walt Disney on TV, Tom Hanks just wasn't that convincing. His accent sounded southern at times, rather than the kindly, rich, well-modulated voice of Walt Disney that I remember.  I guess Walt Disney was just one of a kind.

Too many flashbacks!.  Flashbacks should be used no more than once or twice in a movie, otherwise, it confuses to the audience (me). Just tell the story in order, OK?

Aside from those distractions, it was a touching story that I would rate 3.5, but gave it the benefit of a doubt (mainly because my wife told me to rate it a four). I could have waited for this movie to be free.",1398384000,,825,4.318181818181818

The storytelling is masterful without being sentimental, and it gives us honest glimpses into Travers' as well as Disney's (Walt's) life.

5605160,3,B00BEIYSL4,"When  the author of ""Mary Poppins"" comes to see Walt Disney about making her books into a movie, we learn about her childhood and the inspiration for her characters.  She's a rigid sourpuss, immune to the warmth and charms of Mr. Disney, however, and won't even consider the changes he wants.

The constant flashbacks to P.L. Travers' childhood are interesting but slow down the main story.  Tom Hanks is utterly lovable as Disney and plays well against Emma Thompson's brittle, control-freak old maid, Travers.  It's fun to see the two pros act together.

There is trivia galore for fans of the Mary Poppins movie, but this is actually a very lightweight and inconsequential story, more suited as a ""extra"" on the Mary Poppins DVD, rather than a full-length film.  I enjoyed it but have forgotten most of it already.",1398297600,,817,4.83453237410072

It seems that Hollywood can still make a good movie but, evidently, still doesn't know which movies are really good.

I'm glad I saw this true story because it made me aware of the fact that Walt Disney is the one who really deserves the credit for giving us the beloved character, Mary Poppins.  P. L. Travers' Mary Poppins was not nearly as lovely as the Mary Poppins that was given to us by Mr. Disney.  Without Disney's adaptation of Travers' book, Mary Poppins would not be nearly as liked (or remembered) as she is.  Great job, Walt!  Thank you!",1398297600,,718,4.5703125

5605218,2,B00BEIYSL4,"A slick advertisement for Disney, thinly disguised as a movie. If you enjoy two-dimensional storytelling and syrup laced with saccharine, you may disagree with me. As others have said, Thompson's acting was superb and Hanks turned in his usual first rate performance, but, for me, none of that overcomes the vacuousness of this sentimental slop. Over course, Disney was never going to make a more complex film about what really happened. The real PL Travers was a darker and more tragic figure than even the film portrays and Walt Disney wasn't quite so innocent. In the hands of a fearless filmmaker, this could have been a fascinating story, but Disney pictures was more interested in telling a story that would wring more money from Mary Poppins.",1398297600,,749,4.9523809523809526

You come away sad for the author, even though the Disney film has been a joy for so many viewers.  It's even more tragic when you find out that the movie is not true to the facts.

5605248,3,B00BEIYSL4,certainly a different outlook to the story of mary poppins. interesting story. some comedy. some serious drama moments. I thought it was a comedy type movie and although there were some comedic moments I would not say that this movie is a comedy. the background story to the making of mary poppins was actually kind of sad. it was definitely however a labor of love.,1398211200,,366,4.6461538461538465
5605249,5,B00BEIYSL4,Nobody makes movies better than Tom Hanks - no matter what kind. Clean family fun movie for all to share and the storyline is great.,1398211200,,132,4.32
5605250,5,B00BEIYSL4,I never knew the background story to Mary Poppins.....now I love it all the more!! Great acting Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks!!,1398211200,,125,4.7272727272727275
5605251,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I am a huge Disney fan and I wanted to see this movie because it's a ""history lesson"" of how the movie adaptation of Mary Poppins came to be. This movie follows two storylines. One storyline is the ""present day"" of the film set in 1961 and the other storyline is set in 1906. We find out quickly that these two storylines match up with each other and most importantly throughout the movie we find out exactly how the story of Mary Poppins came to be. There were very sad and uncomfortable parts towards the end of the movie but they needed to be shown in order to explain the title of the movie.

Although I felt Tom Hanks provided the right ""look"" of Walt Disney I did feel at times it was hard to believe he was Walt Disney himself given that Tom Hanks has a very recognizable talk and laugh. Emma Thompson gave a great performance but I did feel she was a bit young to be playing the part of a 62 year old. I did enjoy that they incorporated Tom Hanks heavily coughing several times throughout the movie because Disney died several years later after this story from lung cancer. They don't actually show him smoking but there's one scene he makes a reference to that. It's a morbid tidbit but I was actually somewhat happy to see that little Disney trivia included within the movie.

I recommend this to any Disney history fan. This movie can be emotional at times so I don't recommend it to the younger children. There's a scene where they go to the Disneyland theme park so if you like the theme park you might find this movie interesting for that. If you are a Mary Poppins fan I think you'll love this movie as well as it gives more backstory and an inside look on how the movie came to be.",1398211200,,1697,4.283489096573208

5605283,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I only gave it three stars because I felt the characters in her flashbacks were a little too ambiguous, especially her father, Travers Goff. This character seemed to lack continuity. Perhaps that was the point, but it could have been written a bit more clear. Colin Farrel's acting was well executed, but the script somehow lacked. I was not drawn in by the scripting for her mother either. Perhaps the writer wished to portray Ms. Travers' with the surrealism in dark memories of long ago. Certainly this is an afterthought. While watching the movie, I found the ambiguity a distraction. Just not one of my favorite movies starring two of my favorite actors.",1398211200,,659,4.84070796460177

(I even got to watch it on a Disney cruise......packed house there.  I was sitting on the floor in the aisle as were many others.  What does that say about the movie?

The acting was great, as you would expect given the actors.  Tom Hanks made a great Walt Disney. I think if it had been edited differently, it might have been more interesting.

In the book, Mary Poppins was a dark character who put the children in some very frightening situations. She always saved them, but not before they were terrified and happy to be home. She was a bit vain and very stern and proper. Julie Andrews (I guess it was always Disney) turned her into some sweet, bouncy, silly person. I never understood how  P.L. Travers could stand for it. And now I know. As a child, the film was fun and I knew all the songs. And as a child, I often read parts of the books to feel safe at night.",1398124800,,659,4.188976377952756

The film is well done, but it is a very sad story about Mary Poppins' creator Pamela Travers.  Mrs. Travers was a very difficult individual and I guess that is where the comedy comes in.  It is interesting that the original Mary Poppins film was made with essential B actors except for Julie Andrews and the story of the making of Mary Poppins has all A listers playing the key roles.",1398124800,,532,4.29

The interpersonal relationships of many of  the characters was very interesting.  The flashbacks to Emma Thompson's past worked well.  In a way it was a sad movie but there was a good balance of comic relief  I found the peculiar connection between the main characters' pasts fascinating.  Sometimes people are not what they seem.

However, I really wanted to see this film, as I worked at Disney Studios during this time and later, and also my father is Robert B. Sherman, so I wanted to see how he was portrayed.  I was also a kid-friend of Walt, and I love both Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, and know the MP/PL Travers story from the time and from the Disney and my own father's words.  It was a cool movie, but my Dad's actor didn't do the homework on how he was (he died about 3 years ago, my father, not the actor obviously) He didn't get my Dad's actions, (which could also be the script) and there are lots of people who knew my father, tons of film of him that is quite telling and most of it, or plenty of it is within the Disney archives.  This could have helped him with his very distinctive movements and temperament.  However, this is a daughter (and sons, From the POV of the film, the characterization of my father was not central to the essence of the film, and I understand this.  Hanks ""got"" Walt pretty darn well, made me miss him!  I never met Travers, but heard lots about her, so I can't really say much about this fine actress and her performance of this character.

In her usual stunning way, Emma Thompson shows us the true back ground and inspiration that created Mary Poppins from the heart of an imaginative girl to a broken woman. Through a series of flashbacks we see the joys and pains that birthed our favorite nanny. Tom Hanks plays the we'll-loved and whimsical Walt who saw through the strict exterior to a woman who needed to be healed.

If you want to see the entire story of a little girl who was scarred emotionally, but Walt slowly convinces Mrs. Traverse to release the rights of her story for Disney to make it their own, and create a wonderful ending for her story.  You may want to watch Mary Poppins if you have not seen it before.  It would be a good prerequisite to watching and understanding this movie.

5605590,3,B00BEIYSL4,"This film was not my cup of tea. It did not quite match the trailers.

Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has liked the books on Mary Pippins and wants to make a movie. However he needs the permission of P.L. Travers / Helen Goff (Emma Thompson.) Travers is struggling with her view of a past life which prohibits her from seeing what Walt is trying to accomplish. Can the situation be adjusted?

The film is slow paced with a downer attitude. Emma does too good of a job of playing a bitter woman regardless of the outcome of the presentation. Lots of drawn out downer music for the background. At least the music does not start blaring at odd moments or drowned out the voices.

The only real highlight of the movie is a Disney speech that is a tad long. It was necessary to explained what was only inferred in the first  of the film.

The magic kingdom that is displayed in the film looks like the one I visited.

The film is not spectacular. Some people may give a good rating because of secondary items such as who the actors are or what the subject matter is. However I look at the presentation as a whole.",1397865600,2,1101,4.294685990338165
5605591,5,B00BEIYSL4,I loved this movie. But I kept thinking Emma Thompson must have exaggerated her character. Nobody could be like that....until I watched the real-life photos featured during the credits with an actual tape-recording of the original sessions at the very end. OMG. Make sure you watch this all the way through - including the credits. The tape-recording at the very end of the credits is the best part of the movie as far as I am concerned.,1397865600,,437,4.688311688311688

I did not know any of Mrs. Travers' background or Disney's year-long effort to obtain the movie rights before seeing it.  As expected, Emma Travers was magnificent as P. L.

5605655,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Emma Thompson stars as the neurotic, angry, and very unhappy author (P.L. Travers) of the very loved children's books featuring Mary Poppins.  And she does a wonderful job at it.

The movie is entertaining, engaging, and rather emotional.  Disney the studio has taken liberties with the truth (not surprising for any Hollywood studio), particularly where Disney himself was concerned.  But the movie does what was intended - which is to let the viewers know that Disney the man faced huge obstacles bringing the movie to the screen.  All because the author was a bit, well, nuts.

One good effect will be that most viewers will be motivated to turn to the internet, and find that she was actually worse than the movie represented.  The author had a background as an actress before she was a writer, and some very shady aspects to her nature, as well as very shellfish ones.  According to her grandchildren, she died ""alone, loving no one, and loved by no one.""

So it isn't surprising to find Disney bent the truth about the ending.  Disney claims Travers crashed the Premier, then loved the film, with the two parting friends.  In reality, Travers crashed the Premier as noted, but was incensed by the movie, and left with a snub from Walt.  She then proceeded to refuse any further association with Disney, and in fact refused to ever work with Americans again.  Anywhere.",1397779200,,1374,4.7957446808510635
5605656,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This is an outstanding movie.  One never thinks about how tedious it must be to make a movie from a book especially when the author is passionate about what they have written.

Great family movie...just great",1397779200,,409,4.5

5605659,2,B00BEIYSL4,"It shouldn't be surprising that Disney would make such a lollypop movie about Walt Disney. What is surprising, however, is how hammy and wooden Emma Thompson is. She is a great actress...usually. But in this movie she starts out strident and pissy and winds up pissy and strident.
This is supposed to be a movie about a woman finally coming to grips with her charming and alcoholic father, guided by the steady avunular hand of Walt Disney. But Miss Thompson uses the same facial expressions for her ""aha"" moments as she does for the unruly child on the air plane. What a waste of talent. And part of this must be laid at Tompson's feet.

I was, however, enchanted by the story it told on the strength of the performances. It turns out that the real P. L. Traverse was much more complex and had a more storied life. The point is well made in the film that any revisionist history can supplant the real story and become the popular notion of truth. It does this even while projecting it's sanitized version of the author as the truth. Perhaps, in this case, it is best we take some of the lessons of this film with Disney's spoonful of sugar!

It's takes until the very end to fully understand things but when you see all the pieces finally laid out for you, it's a tremendous AH HAH!

5605796,3,B00BEIYSL4,I enjoyed the movie but it was completely different than what I had expected.  It's good for the movie collection but can't imagine watching it over and over...maybe once a year or two.,1397692800,,185,4.606060606060606

The story is odd, but the flash-backs are more detailed and informative than flash-backs in some movies.  The movie is not too long, otherwise I would have become tired of Mrs. Travers.  The movie flows well because I watched it all the way through.  I don't think I will see this movie again, but I will certainly watch ""Mary Poppins.""",1397606400,,459,4.548780487804878

Although the subject was the development of a child's movie this was not a child's story.  It was strong, emotional, and in some areas even exhausting.  It was well worth the time and small amount it cost to rent.",1397606400,,378,4.194444444444445

5605853,5,B00BEIYSL4,"It is absolutely shocking to me that this film would be so ignored by the award season.  It was a great story with great acting, screenplay etc.  Emma Thompson not receiving an Oscar nominiation is a travesty and to add insult to injury Sandra Bulleck was nominated for Gravity.  Hollywood has become a politically correct popularity contest.  To nominate a nobody like the guy in Captain Phillips is a disgrace.  Even though I did not see 12 years a slave and have no intention to,  I hear it was horribly violent not to mention Wolf of Wall Street.  When Is Hollywood going to wise up and stop releasing films that influence violence to children.

5605855,4,B00BEIYSL4,"We liked this movie when we saw it at the theater when it came out. Emma Thompson was exceptional in her role as the annoying author of Mary Poppins. The movie itself was very good and we will watch it again as we are now the owners of our own copy. Tom Hanks was good, but not his best movie. He seemed to be more supportive of Emma than to draw attention to himself. You will enjoy it if you hang in there through the beginning.",1397606400,,430,4.011627906976744
5605856,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I love the Mary Poppins movie, having watched it many times, with my nieces when it first came out and then with my own children years later. I looked forward to seeing Saving Mr. Banks when it was first announced, and wasn't disappointed. It's such an endearing story-so glad that Walt Disney was able to persuade the author to agree to the movie and all the fantastic songs!",1397606400,,376,4.544117647058823
5605857,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I was a little worried about watching this with my 9 year old.  The movie has a rating of PG-13 and I agree with the rating.  The issue of mental illness runs throughout the story.  After reading a review online I decided to try watching it with her (I can always turn it off).  I was glad our family decided to watch it.  We all really liked it.  I prefer this movies portrayal of mental illness as a sad event, one that effects a person their whole lives to half the stuff that is in kid shows these days.  The acting in it is wonderful and the story is inspiring.",1397606400,,566,4.090909090909091

5605861,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This movie really gives in sight to the lady behind the story of Mary Poppins's  difficult to watch in beginning as she is very difficult and demanding but Walt wanted the rights to the book so you could produce the movie. In the end it all worked out well. The writers , script writers, music people were very talented men & women. The movie is 5 stars children would not be interested in it",1397520000,,392,4.297297297297297

This movie is amazing. It really lived up to the hype. The story is great, it's heartfelt, and the delivery is perfect. I wasn't sure how I felt about Tom Hanks portraying Disney, but he was wonderful in this.

The story is one I hadn't heard before, but I don't want to give anything away. Here's the only thing I'll say, have a box of Kleenex handy, you will cry. And if you are like me, you will cry more than once.

The bonus features were fun to check out too.
This is easily a new favorite movie for me. Add it to your collection. I'm sure you'll love it too.

5605876,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Another highly Mouse Rated movie, leaving you with that warm N fuzzy Disney feeling. Has excellent acting, excellent plot line, great special effects n music, and leaves you with that special feeling that ol Walt was always right?
That wonderful feeling that blurs the real world with that ol Disney magic. Forget half the real story, the half that shows how ruthless and cunning that Disney was, why spoil the movie with reality?  Tom Hanks did an excellent portrayal of that magical man that created make believe into the believable, and Emna Thompson also portrayed the famed Queen character we all know and love to hate in Disney flicks - and once again the Queen loses in the end too!
It's a great tub of popcorn n drink film, but watch out for the gummy bears that glue your mouth shut in the end - and that's how Disney does it so sweet yet not so satisfying in reality....",1397520000,,880,4.534591194968553
5605877,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Strong character performances by two favorite actors.  Ms. Thompson's portrayal of the abstemious P.L.

5605907,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This is one of my top ten all-time favorite movies. It is a fascinating and sympathetic portrayal of a complex and troubled woman for whom several serious psychiatric diagnosis come to mind. As strange and difficult as Mrs. Travers was, I found myself drawn to her with a strong desire to make things better for her. I understand that only part of the portrayal of her life was true, but the story that was made from part true-life and part fiction was compelling, from the first word to the last. It was an incredible story, whether true or not.

This movie has hardly anything to do with the movie ""Mary Poppins"". Instead it is the story of how and why P.L. Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins book series, finally agreed to allow Walt Disney to buy the right to make a musical film using the characters from her series.",1397433600,,826,4.470198675496689

The story was very interesting, kept my attention as the curmongen author insisted throughout most of the film
to have her way. ( I wish she had now that I have seen what Walt Disney did to Mary Poppins). The fact that most authors
do write from their personal history was the thread that wove itself throughout this movie, making it more human and touching.

It really tells you why and how Mary Poppins came into being.  Great acting by two of my favorite actors.  I recommend this movie to all who are interested in the story behind the story.

It's so interesting to know how such a creation actually came to be.  The author's background and inspiration, where it truly comes from.  Emma Thompson performance was an A+.  It must have been so difficult to capture the character/person behind the author of Mary Poppins.  What an extraordinary job she did.  The whole cast complimented the movie.

She adds nuance to nuance as she reveals her character. And Tom Hanks provides a masterful bass tone supporting Ms. Thompson's complex melody of feelings. I had modest expectations for this movie and was so pleasantly surprised by its excellence.,1397433600,,414,5.0144927536231885

This movie is different. It's about a woman who wrote that ""Mary Poppins"" and her childhood and her dad. She has her own bottle she is trying to win and doesn't understand that she already won it many years ago. You really do feel for her. Being strong  and cold outside she is still that little girl who has just lost her dad and can't go through it and never accept it.

5606094,5,B00BEIYSL4,"remember the golden age of movies?  or when they were ""movies""?  story lines, actual plots, actual experiences they would lead us through that we hadn't thought about, experiernced before, or knew what was comign next?

Seems everything today is a re-make of something we are already very familiar with, or the content is riddled with extremely predictable sequences, or trying so hard to be unpredictable it doesn't even make sense.  That or is just one long 1-2 hr product commercial for some ""brand"" that figured ""let's make a movie to make more money while we can off this name.""

Very few movies these days come and take us on a journey where it tells us a story we haven't heard of, but can still enjoy.  One that actually makes sense.. and make us experience some emotions or spark something from our own past so we connect with the story or characters involved in the story on-screen.

This one does.  Not only is it based on a true story, not only is it based on a story that held in its balance the destiny of one of film industries most recognizable and loved films of all times... it tells us and gives us a whole new perspective of a ""light hearted movie"" we had no idea what the story was truly telling (until we hear this true story).

Beautifully done.
Quite an experience.
May not be so interesting to those unfamiliar with the movie it is related to.
May be a bit slow-paced for those accustomed to and reared on modern-day type movies.

And that, like the near-miss on the film Mary Poppins ever being put on screen, is a darned shame.",1397433600,,1554,4.498220640569395

5606101,5,B00BEIYSL4,"As a huge Disney fan, I absolutely loved this movie. A peek behind the curtain of the Disney machine in the 1960s. Watching Tom Hank's Walt go head to head with the equally stubborn Emma Thompson's Mrs. Travers was a treat to see on screen. Another surprising character that I enjoyed watching was the endlessly ""sunny"" limousine driver, played by Paul Giamatti. The story, I imagine, was a bit Disney-fied, as it is to be expected, but not as much as you'd think. The edges around the characters of Mrs. Travers and Walt Disney were left a little rougher. You hear Walt coughing every time before you see him on screen (to indicate his illness and smoking habit), and the way his personality bulldozed over anyone in the room barely listening to Mrs. Travers, his insistence on calling her Pam, despite her objections. Mrs. Travers was, for the most part, a barely likable curmudgeon, who seemed to like to disagree with things just because she could. Despite this, or maybe because of it, the audience still feels empathy for both of them and roots for some sort of compromise that would please both parties. This isn't an expose, though. This is still, very much, a Disney movie. But I don't think that should detract from what is essentially, a very satisfying story and movie.",1397347200,,1281,4.723214285714286

5606181,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I loved Disney's  Mary Poppins.  I was eager to watch this film to see the ""making of. . . ""  The movie is an interesting look at the process. P. L. Travers is portrayed as annoyingly eccentric, but not necessarily mean spirited to the core. I have a feeling the real Ms Travers was more harsh and razor edged.  From her background shared in the movie, I tried to understand the impact her childhood had on her reluctance to share Mary's story with Disney.  I wanted to give her all benefit of doubt.  Alias, it's a movie, not a documentary.  As Ms Travers softens, you can sort of like her, almost as if Disney administered his own 'spoonful of sugar' to make the movie go down.

Her dad is portrayed as having an alcohol problem and his death is foretold by his spitting up blood.  A bit graphic for kids.  Are you ready for TB questions?  Tom Hanks was a great Disney.  I've watched it twice.  It's a good movie.  Maybe not what I expected, but a good movie none the less.",1397260800,,975,4.285714285714286

For a brief time, time was suspended and we got a look back at how it once was.  Tom Hanks was wonderful as Walt Disney, I thought I was a kid again welcoming Walt Disney into my home with another wonderful story.  Back in the 60's Walt Disney was the favorite of children and adults alike, and Hanks brought his A+ game to filling those shoes.  Emma Thompson as always is greater than life.  Nobody knew much of P.L. Travers but it does appear that Ms Thompson has captured the character and gave a great portrayal.  When you put Hanks and Thompson together, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.  The scene between Disney, (Hanks) and Mrs. Travers, (Thompson) where Walt Disney finally convinces Mrs. Travers to grant him the rights to make Mary Poppins is classic by itself.  It was the most moving scene I have seen in a very long time.  In short, this was a wonderful telling of the back story of one of America's Iconic films.",1397260800,,1167,4.390697674418605

Through a series of flashbacks to her childhood in Australia, which was dominated by her relationship with her loving but alcoholic father, we see how this childhood is reflected in her creation of Mary Poppins. But that's just part of the story portrayed in this film. We also witness how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who is determined to bring Mary Poppins to the screen, works with Travers, who is, to say the least, an irascible character, and how, through his charm and patience, is able to create a film for the ages, despite the roadblocks that Travers repeatedly throws up along the way. We also get a glimpse of the creative effort of the musical team, as they strive to bring the tunes (many of them still familiar today) to perfection. (Their creation of ""Spoonful of Sugar"" is especially interesting.) If you haven't already seen this film, watch it. You won't be disappointed.",1397260800,,1034,4.880681818181818

5606231,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are in one movie, playing Walt Disney and P.L. Travers respectively. In ""Saving Mr. Banks"" the writer of Mary Poppins books reluctantly flies to Hollywood to meet Walt Disney, who wants to turn her works into a film. Directed by John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"" ""The Rookie""), the film is not just about the making of ""Mary Poppins,"" but about what made the original books so special for the author.

While those Oscar winning players do not disappoint in ""Saving Mr. Banks,"" there is something not quite right with the story, or the way it is told. The film employs a dual narrative, with one thread set during her two weeks in 1961 LA, and the other following her childhood in Australia. The film is tactfully edited, but the device does not work simply because of the uninteresting Australian part that lacks depth.

I am not really sure if, as some people say, the film is too hard on Travers, who is described here as an incredibly difficult person. Whatever the truth is, I was interested in this complicated character in spite of / because of her personality. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Tom Hanks' Walt Disney lacking complexity.

Interestingly, the interaction between Travers and her (probably fictional) chauffeur in LA (played by Paul Giamatti) is more credible and interesting than that between her and Disney. You can see the ending from miles away - after all the film was made - but what matters is the process of how she changes, which is not as convincing as it should be.",1397174400,,1537,4.70631970260223

5606234,5,B00BEIYSL4,"The original Mary Poppins as written end by P. L. Travers is prim, bristelly, vain, and lovable. This Pamela L. travers is well- captured in this movie. We find that Travers's and Disney's childhoods were difficult and the movie makes this clear for both.
Disney knows tha Traver's version of Mary Poppins will not sell. Most children, like Disney's daughter, seem to adore the sweetened version that Disney wanted to film. Therefore Poppins and Disney were at loggerheads throughout most of the movie.
The Young Sherman brothers music captured Travers, particularly ""Feed The Birds"", and she agrees that Disney may make his version of the movie. We all know how the sweet movie turned out. I wish that the movie had been more like the book. I do understand that the sweet version was necessary for success and money.
Children and adults will like this tender movie although the movie is easier to understand without having been in love with the original book. Some may well give this movie a 5 star rather than a 4.",1397174400,,1016,4.778409090909091

5606252,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I am a great fan of Mary Poppins and have fond memories of the show. I can probably sing all of the songs by heart. This show may not be a full 5, but I'm giving it this grade anyway. It's at least a B+. Thompson really shines. Hanks does great. The backstory is interesting and adds a lot of emotion that all comes out in the end. Finally the Sherman brothers get some long overdue recognition for their masterful songs.
This is not a documentary, so don't expect the facts to be perfect. It's a dramatic retelling of the story. Disney really wanted this show and he pulled out all of the stops to get it done before he passed.
There are a few slow scenes and I also took a long time to warm up to the limo driver, but eventually I did. Not sure about this one? Rent it first. I ended up buying it for my permanent collection.",1397088000,,827,4.111111111111111

5606255,4,B00BEIYSL4,"For a movie about how a movie was made, it was pretty good.  ""Mary Poppins"" is not an all-time favorite of mine, but it was fun and interesting to see how many obstacles had to be overcome for it to be made at all.

I haven't been to a movie theater since 1993. Too loud and boisterous for me. I love watching videos on my Kindle and iPad.",1397088000,,396,4.351351351351352

I found out that both people played by Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson played sad characters who dealt with their lives in different ways.

5606308,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Its 1906 in the beautiful and affluent city of Maryborough in Australia. Travers and Margaret Goff are leaving with their two daughters  Ginty and Dolly. Like Pied Piper their jokey father is leading his family to a new home, a new town, a new job in a bank for him and supposedly  a new and happier life. But the nanny who watches them leave yet another nice home and wife Margaret with an infant in her arms seems not so sure. And on the train to a remote place called Allora in Queensland (the last stop on the line)  Margaret watches with concern as her husband Travers sips slyly from a hip flask filled with whiskey. So while Ginty may adore her story-telling Dad who fills her with magic thoughts  she just stands on the back of the train dreamily watching everything shes ever known disappear into the distance because of Daddys ""ways""

Now its April 1961 in London and the child Ginty is grown up into the frightfully prim and prig Pamela L. Travers  author of ""Mary Poppins""  sat alone at her desk meditating (as per the works of George I. Gurdjieff). A ring at the front door brings in her literary agent Diarmuid Russell (Ronan Vibert) who informs her that the royalties have dried up and because she refuses to write anything new - soon even her beloved Bloomsbury home will go unless she procures money. But still shes staggeringly prickly. Russell who has tread lightly long enough rages that Walt Disney - who has pursued her for twenty years to get the film rights to ""Mary Poppins"" - has even agreed to her excessive demands - no animation and full script approval. But she lives in terror that Hollywood will turn her beloved creation into pap.

But needs must  so - soon shes on a BOAC jet to Los Angeles being rude to air hostesses, mothers with children and even the driver who picks her up at the other end  Ralph (a fabulous show by Paul Giamatti). ""It smells like chlorine and sweat!"" she says as Ralph tells her the scent in the Californian air is Jasmine. He buckles up  its going to be a bumpy ride. Mrs. Travers then throws pears out of her hotel window, growls at the writers in the Disney studios, whinges about piddly details like numbers on doors and moustaches and says ""No! No! No!"" absolutely all of the time. Shes even truculent in the face of the legendary Walt Disney and his considerable charm.

Saving Mr. Banks uses the technique of running Gintys 1906 childhood in Australia alongside her 1961 Californian battle with Disney and his people  so we slowly get to see why the dreamy hopeful child grows into a woman who would pen such a prig and proper character. Key to all of this is her relationship with the man she worshipped  Travers  her father. His daily battle with drink made his wife attempt suicide in a lake - lost him his job and health (consumption)  and eventually saw the kids farmed out to a visiting matriarch - Aunt Ellie. And with her starched almost churchlike garments, large carpetbag, face-shaped umbrella and no nonsense practicality in the face of a crisis  Aunt Ellie would of course become the character Mary Poppins. But is Mary Poppins about her saving the children - or is it really about Ginty saving her father through fiction?

The superb cast includes Ruth Wilson as Margaret Travers, BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the composing brothers Robert and Richard Sherman and Bradley Whitford as Disney man Don DaGradi. But the movie belongs to the leads Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson.

Theres a strong body of evidence (Castaway, Charlie Wilsons War, Cloud Atlas and Captain Phillips) that Tom Hanks may indeed be up there with De Niro, Al Pacino, Liam Neeson, Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman and other greats in terms of being the best actor whos ever lived. So it takes serious boots to outshine him as Walt Disney. Up steps such a force of nature - Engerlands Emma Thompson  giving her hateful bully lady a beating heart and gradually unfolding the real reasons for her guarded and prickly nature. Thompson gives a performance of true brilliance - an embattled woman who is hurting so deeply that you literally ache for her  cherishing dreams she cannot have sullied by commerce and gaudiness. The dances between her and Hanks are fabulous  but even better is her work with Giamatti  the humble limousine driver who touches her heart and makes her offer up a rare morsel of kindness when he reveals he has a special needs daughter (tell your daughter she can do anything she puts her mind too).

Credit also has to go Colin Farrell who is magnificent and measured as the troubled yet adoring father Travers. The scenes between him and Annie Rose Buckley as young Ginty are beautiful and immensely moving. Childlike and wondrous himself  he instils in his little girl the qualities that would make her such a great writer later on. But he also crippled her mind with images of innocence betrayed  and a helpless descent into loss that would haunt her for the rest of her life.

Thomas Newmans perfectly complimentary music and the presence of those wonderfully uplifting movie songs that are lingering in the back of our consciousness give the whole film warmth thats tangible. But what really gets you over and over again - is the astonishing and truly immersive attention to period detail. The look of the bank Travers works in Allora, the huge wooden house on a hill in the middle of nowhere, the fun-fair day where he makes a fool of himself in front of his family because hes drunk  Then theres the Beverly Hills Hotel where Pamela stays in 1961  the Disney gift hampers she encounters in her room  even the stationery that Giamatti is holding when he meets her at the airport  all of it is period and absolutely spot on. Theres a scene where Walt takes Travers to Disneyland in an effort to soften her up  the stalls outside the theme park gates  the public crowds walking by the attractions and the carousel that ends up in the movie  huge set pieces - and all of it perfect.

The BLU RAY print is glorious throughout - a big Hollywood production and the picture quality reflects that. Its defaulted to 2.34:1 so there are bars top and bottom  but even extended to Full Aspect  the print is gorgeous. This film is real looker on the format. Audio is English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with English 2.0 - Subtitles are English for The Hard Of Hearing, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish - and the Extras include Deleted Scenes, ""The Walt Disney Studios: From Poppins To The Present and Lets Go Fly A Kite.

And on it goes to P. L. Travers finally sat in a cinema with tears rolling down her face as Walt Disney gives her Mister Banks the joy he so lacked all those years ago in Australia. Even Dick Van Dykes awful accent is forgiven as the joy of the songs and the film transcends everything.

""Wind's in the eastmist coming inlike something is brewingabout to begin""

Saving Mr. Banks is beautifully crafted cinema  superbly written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and Directed by John Lee Hancock.

Travers' demons, and had she not sold her story to Disney, there wouldn't be a movie nor would we be interested in her life. This is a drama about a tormented woman. The Disney stuff is just background. If you expect this to be a mockumentary about the making of Mary Poppins you'll be disappointed.",1397088000,,406,4.217948717948718

5606364,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Solid performances from Hanks and Thompson carry a rather dull plot and stretch it into a full film.  Thompson's portrayal is so on the money, you really get annoyed with her character, which is what good acting should do.  You'll want to see this once, but probably never again.

I grew up watching the Wonderful World of Disney and remember seeing Walt introducing each episode. He seemed so nice and now, after seeing this movie, I know he was just as nice in reality. I loved Mary Poppins when it came out in the theaters in 1964 and now I appreciate the struggle Disney went through to get the story on screen.

I found this sorta, historical view of how the movie came about, extremely pleasing. My wife and I visited Disney Land when it had bare ground and little trees in 1955, and continued to go several times a year. I don't go anymore, but seeing this brought back memories of Disney speaking on TV every week. My great grandchildren still like ""Mary Poppins"" and all go to Disneyland and it's newer park in Anaheim CA.

I've watched the movie twice, and will probably view it again.",1396915200,,617,4.558558558558558

I have to say that I really couldn't stand Mrs. Travers' snobby attitude during most of the movie, but the flashbacks to her childhood gave a very touching insight into her personality. And, to see our beloved Walt and his enthusiasm for his life's work brought back many good memories to me, as I remember watching him on tv when I was a child.

I felt the both the movie makers in our time and the Disney crew back in their time were hopelessly condescending to P.L. Travers.  To have her cry at the sentimental slop of the movie after her unsentimental works and life was just too much.,1396915200,5,322,4.17741935483871

5606531,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Everyone knows about Mary Poppins.  Most of us wish she had been our nanny.  Lots of us still sing the wonderful songs from the wonder movie that was made from the wonderful books about her.  So most of us were expecting that any Mary Poppins related movie would be a comedy, a happy movie or at least a fluffy movie full of jokes and joy.  Not so.  Saving Mr. Banks is a serious movie that pits the worlds greatest maker of family movies against the will of a writer who does not want her work be trivialized. She is also horrowfied by the notion that any Disney movie will make fun of or demonize her ""Mr. Banks"" character, whom she based on her own father.

She had not so much a love/hate but a very happy/sad relationship with him.  She has kept much of her private life secret.  She also is very prim, proper and reserved unlike Disney who is expansive, jolly and an extrovert.  She would never have considered selling her auther's rights to the movies except she is broke and needs the money.  The battle is epic.

We already know who won - after all the movie was made but the story of how it got there is a good one full of insight into both principle characters.  Dispite the serious subject it does have many moments full of lightness and fun, the sets and the period clothing are great and the acting, not just the stars, is supurb throughout.  This Oscar nominated movie should have won more awards and is so worth the time to see. Highly recommended.",1396828800,,1464,4.357933579335794
5606532,1,B00BEIYSL4,"Like everything else Disney, they will try to re0write history in their Disney-centric world view - and you bet Walt will come out on top as benevolent, and his protagonist as an old lonely anti-social shrew, which she wasn't.",1396828800,3,226,4.82051282051282

5606534,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Got this for hubby because he was curious.  The actors do a superb job at making this movie enjoyable to watch and learn from.
We thought it would be just a narrative about Disney and how Mary Poppins came into being. It was so much more than that. I sat in tears in the end and found myself watching several times since.",1396828800,,321,4.17741935483871
5606535,5,B00BEIYSL4,"If you care anything about Disney, music, art, storytelling, the human condition, irresisitible forces, immovable objects, imagination, conflice, compromise, respect, heart, soul and kites, you either already have or will definitely appreciate Saving Mr. Banks.

At the root of the story, though, may be the volatile and dynamic nature of creativity. Writing a book, making a movie, composing songs -- all of these come from scratch, but they all connect to life experiences and deep emotions, sometimes not even realized by the creative person.

You're not doing your job as a creative if you don't come up with something you become attached to. But once you do that, you set yourself up for hurt and defensiveness. It's realizing that and dealing with this phenomenon that is the constant challenge in a creative endeavor.

Few movies capture such an ethereal concept as well as Saving Mr. Banks. It's not about what room Walt Disney stood in on February 3, 1062, nor is it about who is opposing whom. And it's downright foolish and misguided to see it as one side ""winning"" over another. A creative thing is a living thing and it lives on in film, music, print and more. It's about the work, not who is who. That transcends the time, setting and players.

The performances are spot on. Lots has been said about the actors, but I also loved the way it was filmed, the sequences that tied one era to another, and the superb musical score.

Not much in the way of bonus features on the Blu-ray (would have loved a commentary), but the major documentary is very fresh and filled with insight not found anywhere else. The rousing film wrap moment when the crew sang ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" is downright tear-jerking. In a good way.

Mary Poppins has been inducted into the National Film Registry, it's soundtrack in now in the Grammy Hall of Fame and this film cements the Sherman Brothers as artists at the level of Rodgers and Hammerstein and Gilbert and Sullivan. That alone makes it an important motion picture.",1396828800,,2011,4.764367816091954
5606536,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Granted, it started slow - very slow, almost turned it off.

5606538,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This was an amazing movie. You totally fall in love with characters. It is so well written, I was just blown away.

The only thing I didn't like about this movie, is that it's all a lie. I think when you see a movie like this you go into it believing you're seeing the story that no one knew.",1396828800,,292,3.9491525423728815

5606570,1,B00BEIYSL4,"I was very disappointed in the HD presentation of ""Mr Banks"". It wasn't HD and it was not up to standard digital. I'm not sure what the reason for this was, but it was disappointing for sure.",1396828800,2,191,4.1891891891891895
5606571,2,B00BEIYSL4,"Hanks is always wonderful, and he brought along some interesting young talent whom we'll undoubtedly see again.  I'm afraid it was the screenplay that kept us from feeling the pain and joy of the film. Without that, there was just Hank's swaggar and some natty young songwriters. The others just didn't surface. The screenplay kept Thompson's character at arms length, or sometimes in the next block; she was just not much fun along the journey, to understate her character's lack of appeal. The portrayal of her difficult early years just didn't get us on the same emotional planet.

I loved my time with the real Walt in the 60's, get on great with Tom Hanks, and recall with indistinct pleasure the whole Mary Poppin's original when it was released. Even the trailer had me predisposed to enjoy the evening. But, each time Ms. Thompson knitted her brow disagreeably, I winced quietly in the dark as the film jerked forward, cantankerously. I was happier when the movie ended and I could finally go get my root canal.",1396828800,,1019,4.784090909090909

5606574,4,B00BEIYSL4,A wonderfully acted movie and great for the whole family. But don't be fooled by the allusion to Mary Poppins; it's not a children's movie. Best for older kids. A really great story.,1396828800,,182,4.545454545454546

5606667,3,B00BEIYSL4,Slow moving and Mrs. Traverse isn't that likable. She is too flat. There wasn't an understandable connection to how she was and what she experienced. She seemed to have a pretty good connection with her father for a long time which would indicate a more nuanced view of the world rather than one of a surly spinster. The book touched people so it would make sense that she would also be able to touch people. This character wasn't touching.

The magic of Disney and the innocence of the early 60s was captured in the clothing, the food, the air travel and Disneyland itself.  The story within the story set in the outbacks of Australia adds another rich historic component  Emma Thompson gives a seasoned performance.

Two drawbacks to the film include the need for more Tom Hanks screen time and the need for more story when the real Mary Poppins enters the scene in Australia.

All in all, a very enjoyable step back in time.",1396828800,,625,4.594594594594595

5606680,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Some of my favorite people are in this cast and I love the premise of the film. My issue is with the script which spent a lot of time on not so interesting moments and skipped over the events I wanted to know more about.
I was fascinated by the ""war room"" scenes with Travers, Sherman & Sherman and the screenplay writer but they meandered through the plot without a real build and flow. Walt Disney's scenes were interesting but I wanted to know more about him. We only saw him dealing with Travers and that made him one dimensional.  And what was going on with Travers in her own life? Just a couple more scenes would have filled out her story. The scenes in Travers' childhood were necessary but overlong and overdone. I got the message and wanted to move on.
For me it was an issue of selecting scenes to tell the story. I felt like someone who got to the buffet late when all the tasty choices were gone. That made it hard to enjoy what was good in the film.

That journey from Australian childhood to the Poppins movie never stopped being interesting. Emma inhabited her character totally.  Tom as Disney gave it the right sugar-coating to keep the audience in the pleasure zone.  The drip-feed of the songs that we know so well kept the enjoyment in place.  I always hated the lifeless ""Tuppence A  Bag"" song in the Poppins film but in this movie it becomes poignant.

Travers grew up and how her father and family played a role in her upbringing and how she modeled Mary Poppins on the nanny that was brought in to help the family, while her father was extremely ill, and his death.  It shows how she clashed with Disney and his creative teams to bring the true idea of Mary Poppins to the screen.  You get a taste of how the talented Sherman brothers came up with all those delightful songs and how all the creative team struggled with her.

5606874,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Disney has outdone itself this time. They have dramatized the back story to one of their greatest movies, Mary Poppins, and come up with a comedy/drama that just may have you laughing and crying at the same time. Tom Hanks is at his charismatic best as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson brings her effortless skill to the complex role of P. L. Travers, the author who gave the world its favorite nanny. Disney has been stymied for years in his quest to obtain the rights to bring the umbrella-riding governess to the screen and he flies Miss Travers to Hollywood to have one more try at selling her on his vision. He doesn't know that he and Travers both have issues from their pasts with which each has dealt at the same time similarly and differently, and that this will be the key to sharing Mary Poppins with the world as a motion picture. Paul Giammati is perfect as Travers Disney-supplied driver in California, who provides Travers with important insight as to what her work can mean to someone facing challenges.

5606956,1,B00BEIYSL4,"What a joy it was to watch John Candy and Joe Flaherty as farm boys Billy Sol Hurok and Big Jim McBob when they took care Australian singer Helen Reddy each week on the old Second City TV series. They would let her sing a few bars of I Am Woman and then playfully get rid of her with a well-located demolition charge. Afterward, they would joyfully exclaim, She blowed up real good! and she did.

A few minutes into the film, after watching Emma Thompson in her role as P.L. Travers, the Australian writer of Mary Poppins books,  I prayed for the SCTV duo to rise from the dead and blow her up real good. But alas she steadfastly and annoyingly continued for the entire SAVING MR. BANKS movie, and sadly no one could save this cinematic tribute to her nastiness and Walt Disneys wonderfulness.

SAVING MR. BANKS was produced by the Disney studio and may be intended as a vehicle to rework their leaders biography replacing the real Walt with a person who had all the qualities of a saintincredible patience, compassion, dedication and love for both the Mary Poppins character and its creator.

Well, he would have had to have been a saint to react to the Emma Thompson character as soothingly as Tom Hanks Walt does throughout the film. She is so nasty the Walt character instantly appears incredibly kind and lovable like a Bambi or Thumper. As usual Tom Hanks, this time wearing a mustache, plays himself convincingly, but even so we are well aware he represents Uncle WaltSaint Waltthe deliverer of Mickey Mouse and redeemer of the Mary Poppins movie.

Mrs. Travers is a giant pain. Walt is a cartoon fabrication. And the movie stinks. O, Billy Sol and Big Jim please rise up and save us all from this schmaltzy, half-baked, manipulative, contorted view of Disney's world and that of P.L.

This screenplay is very smartly and artfully written. It allows you to make assumptions for yourself and see things that not everyone might see about events history, and about the complex subtleties of human nature that are so confounding and yet so beautiful. It helps you sympathize with someone who would be easy to hate and is a beautiful story about compromise and understanding. It is true poetry.

5607034,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Most of us have super powers, but most of us have only minor super powers, the kind that would get us sent to Sidekick classes as Sky High. One of my minor powers is to KNOW whether or not I will like a movie by its poster. I don't even need a preview. I have never, ever been wrong; I have never been disappointed by a movie I knew I would like, and on the occasions when circumstances exerted a half-Nelson on me to attend a film on my no-go list, my gut instinct was absolutely justified. With Saving Mr. Banks, I didn't even need the poster: the title was enough. I knew this was going to be a movie Id love: truly, madly, deeply.

The Mary Poppins books were in the same category as The Secret Garden and several of C.S Lewiss Narnia books. All these stories helped inoculate the child-me to the very real dangers and hazards of life, but in ways that did not sully the soul or sicken the heart. Mary Lennox, Dickon, and the robin were better therapy than any psychoanalyst would have been; Mary Poppins awed me into good behavior much more effectively than any parental or grand-parental jaw. I respected her fierceness; I loved her view of realities, her secretiveness, her inherent mysteriousness. I loved the way she danced with Apollo, and was friends with stars. And I loved the stories where the children go off on naughty adventures by themselves, and when the babies talk with the visiting birds.
I loved them enough that when I saw P. L. Travers name on issues of Parabola magazine, I bought them to read her contributions. And I have her wonderful About the Sleeping Beauty, which gave a fascinating spin on the evil fairy.
But I knew almost nothing about P.L. Travers the person.  So it was with a sense of keenest, almost breathless anticipation that I settled into the seat of the theatre to see this film, starring the one actress I trusted to faithfully render the author of Mary Poppins.
We see flashbacks of Travers childhood in Australia, where her father is a regional bank manager, while in 1961 she wrestles with a painful decision, driven by financial need. Walt Disney has been trying for 20 years to gain the movie rights to Mary Poppins, and for 20 years she has said no  not holding out for a better offer, just flatly refusing to let anyone muck about with her characters. Now she reluctantly agrees to be flown out to Walt Disneys studio to be wooed, cajoled, entreated to sign a contract.
Walt Disney is Travers opposite: open where she is reserved, friendly where she vibrates between rude and hostile, tender where she is rock-hard, vulgar where she is refined  - the food trays and plushies!
As they slowly, excruciatingly negotiate details of a Disney makeover  Travers loathes animation  it turns out that both of them have a proprietary interest in the father character, Mr. Banks.  Disney insists that he have a moustache; Travers wants him smooth-shaven.  Disney has had a hand in writing the script that portrays the father as distant, dismissive, focused on business above all else  as his own dad had been. Travers wants Mr. Banks to be like the whimsical, playful father she adored. Disney had been prepared for Travers to feel as territorial about Mary as he had felt about Mickey Mouse; the matter of the fathers role blindsides him, and almost derails the project. Once he realizes that they both have father issues, his genuine ability to care erodes her adamantine resolve, like water shaping stone.  Tom Hanks portrayal of Call me Walt Disney is subtle, nuanced, and powerful.
The one flaw with this film is that it ultimately betrays P.L.Travers by implying that she eventually came around to liking that damnable animation sequence.
I cannot stress enough how wonderful the supporting roles are played. Colin Farrell as Travers father is the very heart of the movie, as a certain driver (played by Paul Giamatti) is the soul.  Farrells performance is so brilliant, so moving, that no words can do it justice, at least not without giving away spoilers.  You simply have to see for yourself. In addition, B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers who wrote the songs for so many of Disneys films are like 1960s nerdly versions of the Coen brothers, and Annie Rose Buckley, who plays young Travers, is luminous.

If you also have an eye to appreciate cinematography or costumes, you will realize that this film deserves Academy Award nominations for more than Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It is so beautiful! And the contrast between turn of the century Australian and 1960s American outfits is perfectly presented. Its downright terrifying, in fact. I recoiled in horror every time the film switched eras and the screen went from soft-focus panoramas of outback wilderness and people in hand-stitched, custom-made clothes to sharp-edged depictions of women with bouffant hair-dos in off-the rack outfits and torpedo bras. Every detail is perfect, from the scan of Travers living room to the visit to Disney Land. Disney Studios used to be famous for their realistic dramas  Sounder comes to mind  and this gem of a film deserves to be ranked as one of Disneys best.",1396483200,,5169,4.759776536312849

5607101,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Okay, I won't say it should have made a clean sweep at the recent Academy Awards, I haven't seen the other films that were nominated yet, but at the very least, this film deserved nominations across the board. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an amazing film. Practically perfect in every way. Yeah, I'm sure that has gotten used a lot in reviews about it. Sorry.

The film, based on actual events, tells the story of a reluctant visit by ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers to the U.S., more specifically, to the Walt Disney Studios, to give Walt Disney one last chance to convince her to sign over the movie rights to the beloved children's book. This is going to be no easy job though. This is a woman dead set against her precious characters being reinterpreted by anyone else, least of all Walt Disney! She's a serious, proper woman with no fondness for pixie dust, singing, or (most especially) cartoons! The story moves back and forth between the ""present"", in this case being the early 1960's, and Travers' memories of her own childhood in Australia in the early 1900's. The film gives equal attention and importance to both periods, and it interacts together beautifully, playing the tragedy of Travers' childhood against the magical optimism of Walt Disney's fantasy infused world.

Everything about this film, visually, is beautiful. The acting, it is simply top notch. We're talking about Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers. Thompson is masterful at making a very unpleasant woman equally sympathetic and heartbreaking, but certainly, that is helped by the wonderful performances in the flashbacks. I admit, I have never been a Colin Farrell fan. I don't like the ""bad boy"" image (and how much it fascinates women...), but I have to give him props for his performances as a kind, loving father who had ended up in a career completely contrary to his personality, and who turned to alcoholism in a hopeless attempt to deal with it. The adorable Annie Rose Buckley plays young P.L. Travers, and she is a treasure in this film. Now, I was very concerned, I admit, about the role of Walt Disney. Hanks certainly has the spirit, but could he pull it off? Seeing the first photos of him in the role had me worried! But that was completely unnecessary. Once he is perfectly introduced in the film, I complete accept him as Uncle Walt. Tom is simply amazing in the role! We also get Bradley Whitford as script writer Don DaGradi, and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as Robert and Richard Sherman respectively, the legendary brothers behind so many of our favorite Disney songs. These performances are all priceless, and there are more as well, but the highlight for me was really Paul Giamatti as P.L.'s Disney driver during her Los Angeles stay, Ralph. Though his role is not quite as large as the others, it is just as important to making the film work, and Paul never fails to bring me to tears with his sincerity.

The single Oscar nomination this film landed was for the score, and it's well deserved. There is much Mary Poppins music incorporated into it and throughout the film. The scenes in the 1960's at the Disney Studio spend a large amount of time in a rehearsal room near Walt's office. It's in this room where the Sherman Brothers, DaGradi, and Polly (Michelle Arthur), I forget what her position was, but another fine performance, perform songs for Mrs. Travers and attempt to negotiate dialogue, designs, and everything else going into bring the world of Mary Poppins to the silver screen. It's some truly great stuff, sometimes quite hilarious, and sometimes seemingly hopeless. Now, keep in mind that we don't see the movie being filmed, nor the actors or anything else. This is early in production on ""Mary Poppins"". After all, Walt doesn't even have the rights to make the film yet. This brings up an important issue though. Have you seen Mary Poppins?!!! If you haven't, whether you see ""Saving Mr. Banks"" or not, you really need to see ""Mary Poppins"". And, no, the stage version is not a suitable substitute. In fact, I really disliked it when I saw it a couple years ago, aside from the Step in Time bit. But, honestly, I wonder and I really don't know how someone could fully appreciate ""Saving Mr. Banks"" if they haven't seen ""Mary Poppins"", the classic Disney film. I really don't recommend it. As some have suggested, yes, definitely buy (or rent) both of them, and watch Mary Poppins BEFORE Banks. I also recommend watching it after, but you NEED to have seen it beforehand, I think. Oh, I suppose you can still enjoy Banks, but really, it's going to be far, far less than if you know what they're talking about (and arguing about). Let's just say, ""Mary Poppins"" is truly one of the greatest films ever. I mean EVER. Of course, if you're a hardcore Disney fan, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is probably one of your ""greatest films ever"" too, and there's no reason it shouldn't be. I'm not certain I would put it on that list myself, but it definitely is a true fave, and I'm sure it deserves to be counted among the best films of last year.

As for the Blu-Ray release of ""Saving Mr. Banks"", well, it leaves a lot to be desired in the department of supplements, and that's too bad. The combo pack does NOT include a DVD. Odd for a Disney release. Instead, you get the digital copy. At least those don't require separate discs anymore (or hard drive space), but I liked having the DVD even more. More importantly though, there are only 3 bonus features on the disc. They are great, but they are only three. First, there are a few deleted scenes. Let me say, all these scenes are great. I almost wish they had all been left in. There is this great scene with Giamatti standing up to Walt, to a slight degree, that is just awesome. I understand leaving that one out to keep Walt in a good light (not that it is bad, but it shows him pressuring P.L. perhaps more than the company would like, but kudos on including it in the bonus features anyway), but still, it's as powerful as it is subtle. The second bonus feature is an excellent one. It's basically your behind the scenes of the film, though it's largely about the Disney Studios at the time of when it was set. The film's director, John Lee Hancock, takes us on a tour of the Disney Studios and spends time with the real Richard Sherman in the very places all these events happened. It's some very touching stuff. The final bonus feature is a quick, musical moment from the last day of shooting. A sort of cast party singing along as the real Richard Sherman plays ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" on the piano. Another very touching bit of footage. Yeah, the bonus features are all excellent, but again, just three. I tell ya, a commentary track with the real Richard Sherman sitting in would be awesome! Even if it was just for certain scenes.

Overall, if you are a Disney fanatic, you definitely need this film in your collection. if you love the movie ""Mary Poppins"", you definitely need this film in your collection, but even if you just love this cast and great acting, and old Hollywood, there is so much to love about this film! I love the way they captured the time periods, by the way! I'm not a huge fan of some aspects of the 1960's, but Disney 60's is a whole other thing (I suppose it falls in line with the Mad Men style, but with more stuffed animals and fun), and this film captures it beautifully! Even the Disney Park costumed characters and plush toys are perfectly dated! With the exception of Chip and Dale, ha. Did they add that shot in later? At least once, I saw some very 21st Century Chip 'n' Dale costumes, ha, but that was like a couple of seconds of something only a Disney nut like me would notice, ha. Otherwise, yep, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is practically perfect in every way!",1396396800,8,7784,4.581061692969871

Tom Hanks does a fairly believable job as Walt Disney who was actually hyper everything, but all the soul searching gets a bit much as does the ""message"" about putting childhood disappointments and dreams behind you and moving on etc.  The best fresh moments are provided by the movie's development team that does some songs and some dances and some believable  moments such as a really good explanation  of songs like ""A spoon full of sugar.""

5607135,3,B00BEIYSL4,"I was some what disappointed in this movie.  It was rather slow paced, had some disturbing scenes in it that I don't think children should see regarding the author of Mary Poppins.  The scenes portraying the author's childhood and her alcoholic father and his death scene were a bit much.  I certainly expected to see more of the actual scenes of the final cut of the Mary Poppins movie during its actual filming stages and it would have been nice to see how the author and her family progressed in life following her father's death.  It seemed like there may have been scenes that were not really important in the film, while there were other scenes that they probably needed to make it a more interesting film.

The only really interesting thing about this movie is that we were all sort of informed on how Walt Disney obtained the rights to the story for the Mary Poppins Movie.  It would have been interesting to have had interviews with Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke (spelling on his last name??) if any were made during the filming of Mary Poppins.  Anyway, for all these reasons, that is why I only gave the movie 3 Stars, since the movie was only ""OKay"" in my mind.",1396396800,,1174,4.509433962264151
5607136,5,B00BEIYSL4,It's an awesome movie! We loved it! We especially loved that it was family friendly. There was no bad language either!,1396396800,,118,4.666666666666667
5607137,5,B00BEIYSL4,"By far the best movie I have seen in a long while. I don't go to the movies because I hate to support the avalanche of ""dung"" that Hollywood produces, so I wait till it comes out for purchase or rent. I built a home theater with a HD DLP projector and 8 foot wide screen so I can have the theater experience with the comfort of a pause button. I would have gladly paid the arm and a leg the big theaters charge for this movie. It grabbed my soul from the opening titles to the end of the credits. Emma Thompson is THE best actress of our time. Tom Hanks was the best he has been since Gump. If you don't watch this, you will have missed a masterpiece.
No foul language, no sex, no gratuitous violence. Only a story ( and  back story ) of the most wonderful Disney Movie ever!!!!!!
Bravo to the Producers, Director, Cast and crew. You give and old codger like me hope that the art of film making is not lost.",1396396800,,907,4.067039106145251
5607138,4,B00BEIYSL4,Enjoyed this movie very much.  Then got the idea to follow it with Mary Poppins.  Changed Mary Poppins from a children's excellent movie to a movie to be appreciated by adults.  Two good movies.,1396396800,,194,4.647058823529412
5607159,5,B00BEIYSL4,So much more to this story than expected. For the young at heart who grew up on Mary Poppins. Emma Thompson is wonderful.,1396396800,,121,4.304347826086956
5607160,5,B00BEIYSL4,"As I prepared to post this review here on Amazon, there are already 596 reviews posted for Saving Mr. Banks. I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by Most Recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to the Bluray + Digital version.

I had the chance to see this wonderful new film, when it premiered on the big screen here in Philadelphia.  I had just finished seeing (and reviewing here on Amazon) the then-newly released Bluray of the restored Mary Poppins as well as the Deluxe Version of soundtrack CD for Saving Mr. Banks (you can find my review here on Amazon as well.)

Ill try not to repeat many of the comments that other reviewers have covered but will give you my take on the film, which I loved. Emma Thompson is just great and so is Paul Giamatti (in a great supporting role). Tom Hanks does a decent Walt Disney but he still looks and sounds like Tom Hanks.  I really want to recommend that before seeing SMB, you should revisit (or see for the first time) the original Mary Poppins  especially the new restored version noted above. You will get much more out of SMB that way.

The BD print is great with lots of what I call Disney Color to it. And the story  yes true  is fascinating.
Unlike most Disney home video releases, this one is a bit frugal on bonuses but whats here is nice. There are three deleted scenes (though no commentary to explain why they were deleted), including the one delted musical number: The Nanny Song. You can hear composer Richard Sherman sing this as well as other original demos as bonus tracks on the Deluxe version of the Soundtrack CD. These three scenes total seven minutes. Then there is a nice 14 1/2 minute featurette The Walt Disney Studios: From Poppins to the Present that has SMB Director John Lee Hancock giving a tour of the old Annimation SBuilding and comments from the children of the original Mary Poppins animators. There are no interviews with any of the SMB cast. The last bonus is a clip of the full crew and most of the cast singing the song Lets Go Fly A Kite  with Sherman playing the piano  on the last day of shooting. It runs just 1:47.

While its not considered a bonus the BD has another nice feature not listed on the package. When you get to the menu screen you will see the Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder that appears in the scene where P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson is hearing the Sherman brothers play their songs for the first time.  At the end of the film  over the credits  you will hear the actual records made by Travers. And they are repeated in the menu section as well. It gives a nice reality to the story.

So do I recommend the film? Yes, absolutely  but more for adults who remember seeing Mary Poppins than for children. For everyone, though, go find and see the BD of MP! Its brilliant.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5607161,5,B00BEIYSL4,This was such a heartwarming moving and so moving. Great movie to see and Tom Hanks is one of my all time favorite actors. This was just a fun heartwarming movie.,1396396800,,162,4.258064516129032
5607162,4,B00BEIYSL4,Loved this movie! Learned things I didn't know about Walt Disney! Tom Hanks is wonderful! The story about the author of Mary Poppins is insightful. Thanks!,1396396800,,155,5.0
5607163,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I think part of the appeal of Walt Disney was his ability to project love and kindness.  A humility befitting (though seldom portrayed) by all successful people.  Tom Hanks is our everyman performer a perfect choice to be Walt Disney.  Unafraid and focused, Disney is well equipped with his virtues to handle the outrageous temperament of P. L. Travers.  Emma Thompson can be the bitch this role calls for.  And, she can warm your heart without effort.

What a story!  You'll want to share this movie with everyone.  Make sure you have a copy of ""Marry Poppins"" in case folks want to see the finished project these two created.  Awesome movie!",1396396800,,643,4.7207207207207205
5607164,5,B00BEIYSL4,This movie was very well done- I would highly recommend buying this movie!  Very original and the actors were great!!,1396396800,,117,4.85
5607165,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Can't say as I would have had the patience as Walt Disney to put up with a woman like this. Once again, the story is very interesting that he and his crew would have to endure such a person for the sake of a movie but I guess that just shows the determination of
the Disney mystic. I recommend this movie but can't say I totally enjoyed it. Can't stand a whining woman or anyone for that matter, especially someone like her. Yuke! See it for it's historical value.",1396396800,,464,4.224719101123595
5607166,5,B00BEIYSL4,A wonderful movie.  So wonderful that I had to purchase it.  This is such a great story and look at the background of Mary Poppins.  It makes you want to know more about their lives.,1396396800,,182,4.142857142857143
5607167,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Excellent film making. Tremendous acting from Emma, Tom, Colin and the young girl. This film is better than most of the films who received Best Picture nomination s.",1396396800,,165,4.928571428571429
5607168,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This movie is much better than I expected. I suspect some of the real-life characters' rough edges may have been smoothed out somewhat, the interactions varnished and made more interesting, but the story is both moving and entertaining. One would expect as much given the leads cast, and in this film they don't disappoint.  The script makes the exposition and the relationships easy to follow.  Moreover, it sheds light on what I also suspect is a wide-spread malaise, the lasting effects on a child caught up in the burdens of distraught parents, and struggling to save them.",1396396800,,577,4.938144329896907
5607189,4,B00BEIYSL4,"You root for the mean old lady, even though she doesn't seem to have a heart. The story is told beautifully, using flashback sequences that break your heart. New classic. Love it. Not really for kids bc the concepts are a little mature, alcoholic father, bitter lady with proper english skills, business dealings.  A MUST rent.",1396396800,,327,4.839285714285714

5607192,5,B00BEIYSL4,Didn't think I would like this movie  but my wife wanted to see it. A little slow in the beginning but it got my attention after a while. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are worth seeing playing the parts of Walt Disney and Pamela Travis. Did not realize the difficulties Disney had putting MARY POPPINS on the screen. I recommend this movie.,1396396800,,338,4.451612903225806
5607193,5,B00BEIYSL4,Delightful! Hanks makes the perfect frustrated Disney who finally figures out why the author of Mary Poppins has ghosts of the past that make are reluctant to sign over the movie rights. Emma Thompson is perfect. A bonus is intertwined storyline of the author's childhood.,1396396800,,272,5.066666666666666
5607194,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Very good movie. The history behind the making of Marry Poppins was very interesting and this film was beautifully shot. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are excellent actors and did a great job in this film.  Nothing really ""wrong"" with the movie at all, but it just wasn't quite 5 stars for me. I don't have a good/solid reason why, but that's me rating.",1396396800,,351,4.484375
5607195,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I didn't expect this movie to be so touching and emotional. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were extrodinary. Even people who are not ""Disney fanatics"" will love this movie.",1396396800,,169,4.862068965517241
5607196,5,B00BEIYSL4,Great movie! I just wish it at stayed truer to Mrs. Travers relationship with Walt and the movie. She was never ok with the movie and there was no emotional turnaround between her relationship with Walt. Other than that the chemistry between all the actors is amazing!,1396396800,,268,4.723404255319149
5607197,1,B00BEIYSL4,"This was a lousy film,  and not good for kids. If you want to learn how the author was traumatized by her hard drinking father and see her channel it out on others then they made this film for you.",1396396800,6,197,3.925
5607198,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I had to watch this, being a Mary Poppins fan and I love anything Tom Hanks is in. I was not disappointed! I highly recommend this movie. I got lost in the characters! Every cast member did an amazing job!!",1396396800,,206,4.175
5607208,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Good story that appeared to be based on historical fact.  Tom Hanks played a great Walt Disney.  You will want to watch the original ""Mary Poppins"" after seeing it.",1396396800,,194,4.647058823529412
5607209,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Terrific story about the behind-the-scenes making of a classic film.  Emma Thompson is outstanding!  And, Tom Hanks is...well, Tom Hanks.",1396396800,,137,5.8
5607210,5,B00BEIYSL4,I love these true stories that come out about times in our life we knew nothing about. Tom Hanks was a great Walt and Emma Thompson was amazing!,1396396800,,144,4.178571428571429
5607211,5,B00BEIYSL4,Wonderfully done - Simply a classic! Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are paired perfectly to portray a behind the scenes in the making of Marry Poppins.  Would definitely watch this again.,1396396800,,184,4.935483870967742
5607212,4,B00BEIYSL4,It seems that the plot is based on the real happenings but it's not exactly faithful. The acting is really good and though little slow at times I enjoyed watching the movie.,1396396800,,173,4.4375
5607213,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Two of the best, Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, with the help of a great supporting cast bring to life a poignant and captivating story inspired by real life events.  As I watched the story unfold, I found myself wondering how Walt Disney and his staff could have shown such restraint and tolerance in their dealing with Mrs. Travers.  Eventually I came to realize that, just as the book 'Mary Poppins' wasn't about saving the children, the story being told in this film was not about saving Walt and his staff from the despotism of an unyielding author, and that the movie could be properly subtitled "". . . and Helen Goff.""",1396396800,,623,4.553571428571429

5607215,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Tom Hanks is of course one of the great actors of our time and certainly Emma Thompson is the highlight of the movie.  I haven't seen ""Mary Poppins"" but certain will be doing so very soon.  The telling of the story is also done exceptionally well and really brings to life PL Travers life and how Mary Poppins was born.  A must watch for the entire family.",1396396800,,356,4.2835820895522385
5607216,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Very good movie.  I think I loved it because it reminds me of what movies can and should be.  No sex scenes, no foul language and recalling what Walt Disney wanted for his empire, not what the idiots running Disney are doing today.",1396396800,,231,4.348837209302325
5607217,5,B00BEIYSL4,A great little movie. I never knew anything about how the movie was created. At the end a few tissues might be needed depending on your cry level. I'm real sensitive so it hit me a little. I recommend it for the family.,1396396800,,219,4.116279069767442
5607238,5,B00BEIYSL4,I loved it. I don't have time to write a big long review. I don't like that they force me to keep writing,1396396800,,105,3.608695652173913
5607239,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Overall story well told and well acted.  Characters were unique, unpredictable and beautifully humane. Watch and listen closely without interruption if possible.",1396310400,,161,6.318181818181818
5607240,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I'm old enough to remember watching Walt Disney host his Sunday night TV show; and, have to say that Tom Hanks looks nothing like him. However, by the end of this movie, I believed that I was watching Walt, instead of Tom...the performance was that convincing. It's a darn good thing, too; because Emma Thompson's portrayal of the brittle, brilliant (and, maddening) P.L. Travers would have left anyone else in the dust. This ""Hollywood' bio of the legendary final battle between Disney and Travers for the 'soul' of Mary Poppins has style, acerbic wit, winning characters and a sense of place that is all too rare these days. While it has smoothed some of the rougher edges off of its main characters, its still a delight to see the caustic, closeted Travers deftly fend off Disney's legendary charm and bonhomie. The film is given further luster by the amazing supporting performances of Paul Giamatti, Colin Farrell and Bradley Whitford among others. If you love 'behind the scenes' stories, crackling battle-of-the sexes flicks or just a damn good time at the movies, grab some popcorn and settle down with 'Saving Mr. Banks'.",1396310400,,1130,4.9214659685863875
5607241,5,B00BEIYSL4,I loved this movie. It was very entertaining and the acting was great. It was also nice to get a background on the making of such a classic as Mary Poppins.,1396310400,,156,4.064516129032258
5607242,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This is a great movie looking at the story behind the classic family movie ""Mary Poppins"".  I highly recommend it.",1396310400,,114,4.7
5607243,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Although I enjoyed this movie on its own and I certainly appreciate the very talented Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson, Paul Giamatti, et al, I do realize that once again, Disney recreated P.L. Travers' persona in this film just as much as they recreated her Mary Poppins stories. Despite that, there are some really fun moments, such as Uncle Walt himself taking Travers on a visit to Disneyland. We also see Paul Giammati's lovable chauffeur character ""Ralph"" driving Travers about town and to the Academy Awards, B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzmann as the Sherman brothers in the process of coming up with such great tunes as ""Feed the Birds"" and ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" and Travers finally humming along and tapping her toe to the newly written ""Let's Go Fly a Kite."" If one doesn't know or think about the actual struggle Travers had with Walt Disney and His Mickey Mouse Empire to stay true to her writing, plus the fact that she was most likely a very intelligent and confident woman rather than the mean and crotchety old schoolmarm portrayed in this film, one could really be entertained by this light-hearted and neatly packaged Hollywood-style Disney production.",1396310400,,1162,4.903553299492386
5607244,4,B00BEIYSL4,I love Disney movies and this one was right up there at the top! Very enjoyable! Tom Hanks seems to be exceptional in any roll he undertakes!,1396310400,,141,4.2592592592592595
5607245,4,B00BEIYSL4,Very well thought through story line.  Fascinating story behind how the movie Mary Poppins came into being.  Tom Hanks did a great job portraying Walt Disney.,1396310400,,158,5.038461538461538
5607246,4,B00BEIYSL4,A good movie overall. The back story of Pamela Travers is a bit lost in translation but still good and worth watching!!,1396310400,,119,4.454545454545454
5607247,3,B00BEIYSL4,Should have delved more into her life especially at the time the movie was being made. It did prompt us to check the internet for the real story.,1396310400,,145,4.214285714285714
5607258,5,B00BEIYSL4,Great! Thorougjly enjoyed this movie and the ability to watch in the comfort of my own home in HD quality.,1396310400,,106,4.35
5607259,5,B00BEIYSL4,This movie is certain to touch the heart of any Disney fan. It is family friendly and is such an endearing story from so many directions. Why it was not nominated for any awards is beyond me.,1396310400,,191,4.1891891891891895

5607261,1,B00BEIYSL4,It was ok. Not really catchy for kids considering it had Mr. disney in it. No purpose really. Not recommended.,1396310400,2,110,4.55
5607262,4,B00BEIYSL4,Quite a surprise about the background of a classic children's book and movie. The story of a sad girl whose dream becomes a story of magical happy times.,1396310400,,153,4.5
5607263,5,B00BEIYSL4,Great to see that a good story and great acting can still be enjoyable while nothing had to blow-up to make it captivating.,1396310400,,123,4.391304347826087
5607264,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Well acted, well scripted, well shot, great narrative, good sense of flow, and you get a sense of where the characters are coming from and why. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It was exceptionally nice to hear actual recordings of P.L. Travers, from the scripting sessions for ""Mary Poppins"", during the credits so you can see how NOT exaggerated the character was in the movie. The movie wisely steered clear of how badly Travers reacted to ""Poppins"" publicly after its premiere and instead focused on the more redeeming aspects of the story. It also makes the person of Travers more forgivable and lovable than she was in real life as well as glossing over some of harsher, and apparently unfounded, rumors surrounding Disney himself. A wonderful movie.",1396310400,,761,4.906976744186046
5607265,4,B00BEIYSL4,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. It was well done. Has more depth then I imagined. Mary Poppins is such a great movie. It is nice to learn the background history. Never read the books.,1396310400,,195,4.297297297297297

5607267,4,B00BEIYSL4,"This was a good movie, but it was agonizing at the same time. It makes me want to go read the biography of the author. If the Saving Mr. Banks is as surreal as Mary Poppins is, then it is just another piece of Disney entertainment. It did make me curious about the author. I do not remember ever reading the Mary Poppins books. Maybe I will just do that too. I like Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks as actors. The other actors did a good job too. Small cast overall. Somewhat surreal when you see what Disney did in the Mary Poppins movie...",1396310400,,536,4.163461538461538

5607302,5,B00BEIYSL4,Being a boomer I have very fond memories of Mary Poppins.  This is the story behind the movie.  Tom Hanks is his usual great self and Emma Thompson is fantastic too!  A lot of really great actors make this movie a keeper.  There are adult themes (alcoholism) and I wouldn't recommend it for small children.,1396310400,,306,4.509090909090909

You can actually feel what PL Travers is going thru while watching the movie.  You think she is only trying to protect her creation from being commercialized by Disney, but when you realize this was about her father.  This movie turns the table on why she was the way she was and why.  When Walt actually come to see her in England and tells her about his father, that is the moment when you see the glimmer in her eye she was not the only one who had a difficult childhood.",1396224000,,610,4.315789473684211
5607326,3,B00BEIYSL4,"P.L Travers. I should stop looking up information on the 'truth' of movies. Inevitably I am disappointed one way or another.

But before I get to that, I have to say that the supporting actors were not very good in this film, with the exception of Hank's secretary. The portrayal of L.A. and how things were at Disney seemed like someone's idea of what a 'Disneyfied' business' might be like. Not true to reality.

Still, it was pretty good  because of Hanks excellent work. When he first came on the screen, it took me back to watching Walt on The Wonderful World of Disney, decades ago.

Spoilers

Being a movie, Travers had to have revelations about her childhood and change. Such that she was touched by the movie, as a profound experience for her.

But in reality, she HATED the movie. She did cry at the premier, yes, but out of anger and frustration and disappointment. She went on to be sure that no one could make a film of her work again, although she gave the rights to someone who is in process of producing a play.

Many things in the movie were true. She had an alcoholic father who may or may not have been also a swindler-who droped dead when she was 7. Her Mother did abandon her, and attempt suicide, after her Father died. She later returned.

Travers had to take care of her siblings during her Mother's long abscenes. She shows the signs of the plight of the alcoholic's child-who is burdened with caring for the parent, and trying, endlessly, to 'save' him. Everything reversed-the child burdened with the impossible task of taking care of the parent, meanwhile, not receiving the care and attention she needs and deserves.

She apparently gave rights for someone to create a play, Mary Poppins. I believe it's in production now.

I read that the Mary Poppins books could as easily be seen as horror as fantasy. Apparently some very dark stuff in there.

Seems rather similar to Nanny McPhee. Creepy movie.",1396224000,3,1928,4.608187134502924

5607428,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is a heartwarming movie that most likely may have an affect on any avid fan of the Walt Disney genre of films that have had a memorable movie soundtrack.  One can say that is the rough cut and behind the story film based upon the composing and writing of the soundtrack of the Mary Poppins film inspired by author P.L. Travers' (Emma Thompson) story of the beloved nanny.  Tom Hanks plays the legendary Walt Disney and Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak play the Sherman brothers and Bradley Whitford the conductor and songwriters that romp through the songs and Paul Giamatti the Disney assistant and valet to Travers.  But the most thought provoking part about the film is the biographical elements of the story of Mary Poppins that parallel with Travers' life and her family.

The film is told in flashbacks from 1908 to around 1961 to Beverly Hills to the outback of Travers' childhood and the gut-wrenching moments centering upon her father played by Colin Farell.  Viewers may presume by the end of the film that the inspiration of Mary Poppins originated from Travers's life and Mr. Banks, a tinge of her father's tease that she remembered when he would shave.  Aside from the ironic moments of the film, there are the humorous and tongue in cheek ones of playfulness and sentimental journeys through the songs of Mary Poppins, ""A Spoon full of Sugar,""  recreations of the innocent time period with the nostalgic costumes and props dating back to the early 1960s, especially a trip that Travers was forced to take to Disneyland five years after its opening.  Since this was Tom Hanks' production he adds the authenticity to a tee from Disney's suit to his office.

Saving Mr. Banks can be described with many enchanting descriptions because of how it associates with the most revered and creative geniuses in popular culture.  Like a Disney film but with a back story, or more so two stories and films in one, do not be surprise if the concluding scenes will tug at the heart strings or have one grabbing for a tissue.",1396137600,,2040,4.737288135593221

5607430,5,B00BEIYSL4,"As unusual as sliding up the banister, P.L. Travers abject herself working alongside Walt Disney and his merry crew, the Sherman Brothers and Don DaGradi to bring Marry Poppins from the east winds to the sunny west screen. Given the rights to review the script before filming, Travers seized every opportunity to criticize the music, wardrobe, and even Disney himself in hopes to give her precious ""Marry Poppins"" the justification on how she wrote the story and the message it evokes. With two powerhouses of storytelling, Disney and Travers are on opposites ends on what Marry Poppins is about. And without explanation she leaves Disney and his crew to find the answer and who P.L. Travers is. And in an ironic turn Travers is lost herself with Disney.

The amazing supporting cast: Colin Farrell, Bradley Whitford, BJ Norvak, Jason Schwartzman, Kathy Baker, Ruth Wilson, Paul Giamatti and Melanie Paxson were all spectacular and held their own with Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. The film did a wonderful job portraying the Sherman Brothers musical and amazing talents in songwriting and DaGrati visual script writing. A memorable scene was the introduction to the song ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" that would no doubt make the audience lips utter the lyrics. There was also a nice relationship between Travers (Thompson) and Ralph her cab driver (Giamatti).

The story behind the making of Disney's ""Marry Poppins"" was enjoyable and a major flashback to the first time you had seen the movie. It was exciting to see how Travers was treated at Disney studios with cake and tea and what the Disney staff went threw to please her. Travers was not an easy person to talk to let alone be friends with. She had a strong attitude forwards everything and there was anger and humor in it and that mostly came from Emma Thompson's performance. There were many appealing part of the movie like how the songs were written (Spoonfull of Sugar) and Travers relationship with her father. And like the original Marry Poppins books, there was some dark elements that in turn became life lessons. Although the film left out Disney's avoidance to Travers's suggestions (hence her disapproval of the animation) the film shows hers dismay but was somewhat ambiguous; either she cried over the film or how it reminded her of her father or the songs.

There is no doubt that the movie dramatizes Travers's experiences with Disney but it doesn't ignore who Travers was. Like Disney she is ruthless, complex, critical, and imaginative when it comes to storytelling. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a character film depicting Travers's troubled childhood in Australia through flashbacks while connecting them to her odd personality and her literature skills. Most importantly these flashbacks are tremendously key factors for her inspirations of ""Marry Poppins."" The Banks family in the books are Travers's family- moreover- the people they are not. And for Travers, it is like giving her family away especially to a man who color- wash everything even the darkest time. She is obligated to be very critical to the filmmaking process since she wants the ""gravitas"" within the script. While Disney is a key opponent to persuade Travers in giving him the rights, he is not fully flushed out as he could had been but his presence on screen is effective. Unlike Travers, Disney likes making a spectacle of himself adding on to their everlasting clashes. The scene with them at Disneyland was a marvelous colorful historic experience and a throwback to what is known as a ""simpler"" era. One of the highlights of the two is their conversation at Travers's home, giving the audience a poignant look into Walt's childhood, but there could had been more to Disney than what was shown in the film.

It is interesting that the characters in the movie can relate to one another and connects to the Banks family or the ""Marry Poppins"" book. Even though the characters such as Robert Sherman, Ralph, Disney, Travers and her father cover their dark experiences with a whimsical element with their own talents shows their flaws and their achievements. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" uncover these characteristics and uncovers the lost aspects to ones self and letting it go.

The production of a beloved classic has been known for years but to just read it and to hear about it was nothing comparable to to see it on screen. It was not magical but real thus giving the gravitas of what P.L. Travers has been wanting for her book on screen.",1396137600,,4470,4.907407407407407

5607436,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This movie is one of the best things I have seen in a long time.  In a time with useless drama, crude humor, and despicable characters, Saving Mr. Banks introduces the imperfections of the world, the challenges we strive to overcome, and the hope we  have in a better future.  Colin Farrell does a terrific job of portraying a father who loves his children with all his heart, despite struggling with alcoholism (and what seems to be depression).  He is far from perfect, but tries to instill a sense of wonder, love of life, and imagination into his daughter's heart.

  Emma Thompson, who plays the role of the writer of Mary Poppins (P.L. Travers), and the daughter of the Struggling Father when she grew up, shows us a woman who has seen the dark horrors of humanity.  She does not care for imagination, or false beliefs; reality is her guide and constant companion.  She remembers her father in a decent light, but in the dark corners of her mind recalls the faults of the man and the pain of losing him when she was so young.

  Then there is Tom Hanks.  There have been many roles that Mr. Hanks has taken upon himself.  In none has he done better than the role he takes in this movie.  As Walt Disney, he is a happy, cheerful man; he loves life, imagination, his fellow man, and the wonders of the world.  As he wrestles with Ms. Travers for the right to help tell the story of Mary Poppins, he also tries to help rekindle the lost flames of Ms. Travers' hope, wonder, and faith in a bright future.  Her story, Mary Poppins, is her recreation in part of her early childhood and how it should have ended, rather than the way that it did.  And when he realizes it's true importance to Ms. Travers, like an old friend, he vows that he will save Mr. Banks (the character based upon her father).

  This movie has made me laugh.  It has made me cry.  It has made me felt the pain Ms. Travers must have felt, and it has brought me joy.  I would recommend this movie to anyone ;they would not be disappointed in its quality.  Only the very low lives and trolls would find fault in this movie.",1396137600,20,2093,4.3462532299741605

I thought it would be about the challenges of Disney and his people working with a very exacting Englishwoman who probably thought Americans were children.  Instead it's about how a woman found a way to co-exist with her past--not healing from it, but living with it in a fiercely defensive and vigilant way--and how taking her story public gave her a way to finally find peace with it.  I don't think she ever fully realizes she had no parents--she parented herself and her siblings--and she retains the child's view of her father because, in her mind, it gives her something she likes, to hold onto, so she can believe something positive came out of her childhood.  The movie is an unusual one--thoughtful, emotionally interesting, and revelatory of the unique things we do with the memories of our childhood and our families.

Emma Thompson is amazing in this story of Disney's repeated attempts to please her and get the rights to her story of Mary Poppins.  Both these actors deserve the highest accolades for their continued high standards in an industry that continuously seeks to shock and disgust us with scenes of nudity, violence and drug abuse to get us to watch.  This is not the case with Saving Mr Banks.  This movie relies on dialogue and story to reel us in and make us a part of such a wonderful story.

5607514,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I went to this movie, curious to see how Mary Poppins came to the big screen. I came out with a smile on my face.

There were times when I laughed, teared up, shared Walt's frustration, and Travers' desire to keep her characters from becoming too ""Hollywood-ized"".

All actors/actresses portrayed their parts wonderfully. From the children to the adults, I felt my emotions openly ride on their performance! My favorite scene had to be the ""Let's go Fly a Kite"" sequence. I'd of given the Disney team quite the applause for all their hard work! (And a raise! Travers' was difficult to take at points.)

It was fun to see them weave in so many of the Mary Poppins ideas through-out the movie: During a song Travers' dancing feet imitate the same steps that Poppins' does during her famous ""Stepping Time"" scene and how Travers' father talks about their horse ""Uncle Albert"" and how he was changed into one because of the sound of his laugh. There were many more.

Not sure how much of the movie's facts were real, but honestly, I don't care. The story was beautifully written and thoroughly enjoyable (for adults).

That being said, it is fairly dramatic during some scenes and may be hard for those watching (when Travers' dad is sick and when her mother doesn't know what to do).

Still, it ends on a happy note, which I'm always pleased about. Mary Poppins comes to the big screen!

There is some swearing in it. But no sex.

Bought both the movie and the soundtrack. It was that good.

It portrays two people from very different world views finding a meeting place;  two very different creativities blending to portray a message that neither of them expected to portray.

5607560,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is story of author P.L. Travers meeting with Walt Disney, who seeks to adapt her Mary Poppins books for the big screen.

As a kid, I never was one who appreciated the story and music of Mary Poppins movie and didn't read any of the books either.  I only vaguely remembered the story within the movie (i.e. Van Dyke dancing and the penguins and things like that.)
So I wasn't really sure how much I was going to enjoy a movie whose story was the behind the scenes story of a movie that I really didn't care much for.

But the one thing I can say is that regardless of whether you liked the Mary Poppins movie or books, you will enjoy this movie as the story is very well done with a lot of heart and soul.

The story does an incredible job at portraying the childhood story through the author's eyes as a child providing a very intimate portrait of her life.  There are moments you will laugh and moments you will cry and in the end the movie will leave you with an appreciation for the lady who wrote the books and for the books themselves.

Tom Hanks' as Disney does an admirable job at portraying the man as he was with all the wit and charm that the real Disney was described as being.  And even as well as Hanks did in the role, I thought Emma Thompson as Travers was the stand out for her portrayal of author as Oscar worthy.  There are moments you dislike her, moments you find her charming and moments she makes you cry and brings it all full circle so that you understand what she was all about.  Outstanding job.

Colin Farrell also  gives a great performance as Goff (Travers father).  Showing that even with his flaws he still manages to have the charm that endears him into his young daughters heart.

And although I am sure this is not written to be totally accurate in the portrayal of the real life story (rarely these types of movies are),  but this story is done very well with a sentiment that makes you care about the characters and makes you feel and reflect.  At least it did for me and for those like me with fathers that did live up to their imaginations or wishes.

Overall  a great movie and worth watching 4.5 stars.",1396051200,,2159,4.278325123152709

Also what her motive was in writing Mary Poppins?  Maybe it was her therapy; if so , it didn't work very well.  Ok maybe I am missing something here overall.

5607604,4,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" turned out to be quite a bit better than whatever I expected from it, perhaps I was channeling memories of ""Miss Beatrice"", the occasional animation feature that purported to tell the story of Beatrix Potter.  From what I gather online, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is far closer to the Truth than mere entertainment.  Mrs. Travers was a piece of work, pretty much like her vain, unpleasant and often rude character, Mary Poppins.  In this effort, two stories unwind simultaneously;  one is the contemporary tale of Walt Disney and Co. trying to construct a movie from Mrs. Traver's book, the author having finally  succumbed to his blandishments for the usual reasons:  Money.  Her royalties were on the wane.  She hates everything, and having last say on the scripting, tries to protect her story.  Her recollections of her childhood, in Australia, create the other story, in flashback, which serves to fill in Traver's backstory, and to give the audience insight into the inspiration for Mary Poppins (Traver's aunt).

Only Paul Giamatti's character is invented;  that and the Australian countryside, which is somewhere in California (and Heritage Square, off the Pasadena Freeway).  The movie actually makes Mrs. Travers seem a bit nicer than she apparently was in real life, in Hollywood or London.  ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is more of a light drama than anything else, yet suitably entertaining, given its subject matter.

I only read the book this January, and having done so (it reads very much like Milne's ""Winnie The Pooh"") and grown up on the movie, I can say I'm not much of a fan of either.  Although the last time I saw the movie I marveled at how the townhouses of Cherry Tree lane sort of presaged the McMansion by thirty years...",1395964800,,1750,4.904761904761905

5607641,4,B00BEIYSL4,Ithink sometimes we analyze things almost too much but this movie was tender and well thought out.  Emma Thompson was extraordinary in her role as well as was th rest ogv the cast.  I grew up with Walt Disney as a child so this might be too much of a generational thing to be appreciated by a younger audience but Tom Hanks brought a certain appreciation of his character that allowed you to see what his game play was for the portrayal - a fine actor.  I enjoyed the movie and can easily recommend.,1395964800,,499,4.287234042553192

If you can sit thru the first half, you will be rewarded with a better second half, but if the actors don't seem to like it much, why should we?  There was suspense because I kept thinking, ""Oh, this is going to make Emma smile, but no, she remains a perfect English schoolmarm almost to the end.  Hanks made Disney the fatherly figure we all seem to remember but this film really needed Mary Poppins to pop in.",1395878400,,492,4.315217391304348

Hard to believe that the great Walt Disney passed away only a few short years after making this film at the very young age of 65! What a huge loss. On the other hand, PL Travers lived to the ripe old age of 96 before very recently passing away. Go figure!",1395878400,,507,4.347368421052631

Glad that film got made, despite the bitter and the (apparently) accurately portrayed, Emma Thompson character.

5607698,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Very interesting story. Compelling!  Moved me to tears!  I was not at all familiar with the story of how the Mary Poppins movie came to be.  However, Saving Mr. Banks made me want to watch the movie with fresh eyes.",1395878400,,215,4.325
5607699,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I enjoyed this movie and found the leading characters to be very interesting.  There were a few spots in her back story that were a bit 'stagey', but then i dislike any hint of a dream sequence tucked neatly into a movie.  The contrast between the two main characters was delightful.  Tom Hanks made a wonderful Walt Disney; Emma Thompson could  read the phone book with a bag over her head and would still be enjoyable.

I wish that more had been made of the story of the driver's daughter, but i suppose that would have taken film in too many directions.  All and all i would recommend this movie to all who like to know a bit about the background of famous people and movies and who enjoy a good film without anything at all being blown up!",1395878400,,743,4.309352517985611

It is a great movie but I don't advise you to watch it with a child under the age 13. I give it 5 stars for people 13 and over but about 1 star for people 12 and under.

5607738,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Well done! Acting, character study, history, ""back story"", personal struggles, and Disney's personal sweetness and compassion. I loved all the characters, but especially loved the relationship that developed between Ralph, the chauffeur, and Pamela. It was also interesting to see the food, alcohol, and tobacco usage of the time. I am certain that Disney's would have lived many more years without tobacco, and that makes me very sad. The colors were beautiful. One of my all-time favorites.",1395878400,,492,5.402597402597403
5607739,5,B00BEIYSL4,Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks were fantastic! The story was moving and watching several relationships develop was a rarety in films today. I can't believe these two actors weren't up for awards.,1395878400,,192,5.03125
5607740,2,B00BEIYSL4,"Not a feel good movie like one might think. Biography of author,  her childhood difficulties, and the challenges Disney had creating the movie with her. Too long and drawn out.",1395878400,,176,4.866666666666666

5607742,2,B00BEIYSL4,"Online delivery of Instant Video was terrible.  Picture quality was fuzzy, even on my high definition system.  Plus there were frequent pauses for loading.  And, if paused, the system would not pre-load to a buffer.  So there way no way to watch the show with good picture quality, and without interruptions.

The movie itself was well made, but too dark for my taste.",1395878400,,368,4.777777777777778

5607745,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Amazing rendition of a question I had from my youth. ""Why was Mary Poppins so mean at times, when she seemed to wish to be nice. Apparently that was a result of a very difficult balance between Walt Disney's efforts to dairy his and his daughter's vision, and the pain of the author and her rigidity brought about by her childhood and England. A very interesting and difficult situation. I have gelate respect for Disney now.",1395878400,,425,4.605263157894737

5607768,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Highly impressed with the story and the presentation. Really enjoyed it.

Storyline included the topic of alcohol abuse, some blood, and the death of a main character, may be somewhat difficult for children to fully enjoy, but excellent for somewhat older viewers.",1395878400,,264,5.285714285714286
5607769,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This was a surprising story. So often we don't know backgrounds of events that we take for granted. Emma Thompson was delightfully irritating. She should truly win all kinds of awards for her acting in this film. Tom Hanks makes a very convincing Walt Disney, and I was so glad to see that my childhood image of him was not in any way diminished in this story.

5607787,5,B00BEIYSL4,"An awesome story, factually based. A tear jerker in all the best ways. Watched it on a tablet with my wife on a plane and folks must have wondered what was happening as we 'sniffled' thru part of it.",1395878400,,199,4.128205128205129
5607788,5,B00BEIYSL4,Emma Thompson gives an incredible performance as a very complex character who unfolds just as her story develops into an iconic film. Tom Hanks portrays Walt Disney as a successful man who had reached the point in his career where he seems to have figured out how to be human and successful. Delightful! The Disney team is also a great example of how brilliant Disney was at finding the right people for every job.,1395878400,,414,4.608108108108108
5607789,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Excellent film- the subject matter was relevant to an entire generation. The acting was superb. Well done! If you like Tom Hanks, enjoyed Mary Poppins, in the mood for a film that lacks crude-in your face statements... this is for you. The story was fascinating- I refuse to say any more, as I don't want to spoil it. Enjoy.",1395878400,,324,4.508474576271187
5607790,5,B00BEIYSL4,I really enjoyed Tom Hanks in this role.  The movie is about the story behind the making of the movie and ultimately the story behind the book _Mary Poppins_.  Emma Thompson plays P. L. Travers beautifully and the movie just draws you into the story.,1395878400,,250,4.533333333333333
5607791,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I liked this movie because it gave me pause to look at my own life and see that how I act now as an adult had a lot to do with my being raised. Things I want to change and couldn't now I can. Learned from being up tight to relaxing more about attitudes of my self and others.
I liked the movie cause it was PG with no sex or violence and had an adult theme. Don't need those elements for a good movie. I never knew what the story was behind the making Mary Poppins.
Just a great movie.",1395878400,,485,3.8118811881188117
5607792,3,B00BEIYSL4,"This movie is fine, not amazing by any means. Pretty good acting and interesting to see the story behind Mary Poppins but a bit slow. I usually love Emma Thompson...thought she overacted at times in this movie.",1395878400,,210,4.702702702702703
5607793,2,B00BEIYSL4,Unrealistic..no one would put up with working with the Emma Thompson character.  Hard to understand in places (mumbling).  Really disappointed.,1395792000,,143,6.1
5607794,5,B00BEIYSL4,Who knew such a sad story was behind one of the best Disney classics! Phenomenal acting and some hilarious moments (Thompson and Whitford dancing!). Thompson and Hanks really brought Travers and Disney to life. Definitely recommend this!,1395792000,,237,5.4324324324324325
5607795,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Overall, this is a good movie. The two themes weave together nicely and there's sufficient character development to hold the interest. The acting is superb as one would expect from a cast featuring Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson, Colin Farrell and Paul Giamatti. The subject is fascinating- the making of one of the most beloved movies of all time. The ending is suitably sentimental without tipping over into mawkish.

The only reason I don't believe it's a great movie is a question of balance. Certainly P.L. Travers was a difficult person to deal with (and we have her own voice over the credits at the end to testify to that). However, this script portrays her as unbelievably tiresome in her anti-American stance on, well, just about everything. Even if that was the case in real life, after the first third of the movie it begins to be annoying. I'm British by background and I found myself saying ""Not again"" as she raised one trivial issue after another in the rudest possible fashion. She came across as too unpleasant to generate much sympathy and while the last third of the movie went some way to explain and partially rectify that, the middle third was simply annoying.

I'd have rated the movie at three stars were it not for the performances. Paul Giamatti, in particular, came very close to stealing the whole film for me. Watch it for the beginning and ending and the wonderful acting and try to ignore that weak middle third.",1395792000,,1438,4.725099601593626

I did.  But I hadn't expected it to show such a transformation in P. L. Travers.  I loved that she was protective of the character, and the Banks -- all her family.

I loved Walt Disney's devotion to his daughters and the book.  Of course, I loved his humor and, eventually his understanding of ""Pamela.""  And I loved watching her melt and begin to smile and have fun.

When we did watch the anniversary edition we were pleasantly surprised too. But this movie was superb in bringing to light the pathos from which the story and  the Disney parks emerged. Paul Giamotti was haunting as the limo driver who carried his own burden with incredible grace and gave that grace to ""MISSUS"" whom he instinctively knew was also a person whose crankiness was just because she was so hurt by life. a story that saved more than Mr. Banks watch it with plenty of tissues.",1395705600,,615,4.442477876106195

Whatever her life choices, she was a girl once, whose circumstances led her to write, and to write herself out of her past to survive.

I appreciate that you shared your writing with the world.

With my thanks.

5607906,5,B00BEIYSL4,Well done.  Gave context to a wonderful movie from my childhood.  I was moved by the real life events that gave rise to Mary Poppins.,1395705600,,133,4.28
5607907,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Forget for a moment that these are characters based on real people.  Forget that several of these people were very public figures.  Forget the long standing lore of Disney vs. Travers.  Forget that Tom Hanks will never sound exactly like Walt Disney (by his own admission).  Then look at this film again.  It is bubbling over with complex characters portrayed with depth and affection: everything from Brad Whitford's courageous open palm, Giamati's scene under the tree, Novak's barely suppressed anger, Farrell's struggling spirit, to the brilliant work of Hanks and Thompson in scenes I could watch again and again.

That the movie is about the conflict familiar to me, because of my love of the Mary Poppins movie and books, is only sauce to add to an already rich dish.  Am I in danger of mistaking this for actual events?  No, I am a little brighter than that despite what pundits and critics might suggest.  Do I see this as just another mop up of its image by the Disney Co.?  I am not so cynical.  I see it as a masterfully crafted ""what if?""  As Hanks says as Disney, ""...maybe not in life, but in imagination. This is what we storytellers do.  We restore order with imagination.  We instill hope again, and again, and again.""

I know that I will come back to this movie again, and again, and again.  And each time, my heart will sing, my head will dance, and my spirit will soar like a lovingly repaired kite. I will come away with something I didn't see before: a thought, a moment, a gesture.  And I will rejoice.",1395705600,,1526,4.551470588235294

5607910,5,B00BEIYSL4,I was really touched by the story of PL Travers.  I think that what really made the movie so poignant is that they successfully weaves her life story with that of Mary Poppins story.  I would really recommend this movie.  Tom Hanks is awesome as Mr. Disney but Emma Thompson stole the show.,1395705600,,290,4.433962264150943

It is a deeply touching story of a woman and how her relationship with her father made her what she was.  No swearing, no off-color anything.  Just gorgeous photography, also.  A masterpiece.

Both Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are really worth watching in anything but this movie was really enjoyable because it brought back memories of much loved Mary Poppins and Disneyland. I like the back story of Walt Disney as well as P.L. Travers.

5607963,5,B00BEIYSL4,I was surprised by how touching and moving the story was.  I loved the editing and the interweaving of the stories.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1395705600,,141,4.6
5607964,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This was done very well! I have no idea how much of the movie is factual but Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson delivered a top notch performance and showed the true heart creators have for their characters and some of the back story for Mary Poppins.

I personally don't think this is a good movie for younger children to watch due to the flashback scenes but would recommend to everyone else. Also loved the old California scenery!",1395705600,,426,4.532467532467533
5607965,3,B00BEIYSL4,"There are certain movies that you could watch over and over.  For me, The Lion in Winter and Hope & Glory are my watch any and every time movies.  Other movies, I'm glad I saw it, but not much more.  This is basically my barometer for how good a movie is.  Would I see it again?  Banks I would not watch again, but I am glad I saw it.

I heard about this movie on NPR and it's a very interesting story.  It's about the woman who wrote Mary Poppins and the difficult time she gave the Disney company to make the film.  There were times in this movie where I just wondered why someone didn't just clock her.  She is so obnoxious and difficult you want to reach through the movie and throttle her.  But where Emma Thompson does a good job in playing the part is you see that she's in such pain that it makes it very difficult to hate her.  That's not an easy tightrope to walk so I give her props for that.

What I found most fascinating is how nice everyone was to her.  It's a stark contrast to what it would be today.  I'm not sure it actually went down the way it's portrayed, and I seriously doubt it was, but if they were half as nice to her as they are portrayed to be in the film, man, times have seriously changed.

I liked the change that the character goes through in the film.  You see her begin to heal.  I've been to Disneyland and I cannot report any such miraculous change, however I do hope that part is true.  The only change I've ever experienced at Disneyland that might be thought of extraordinary if not miraculous was the one to my wallet.

I would definitely encourage seeing Mr. Banks, but I don't think it warrants repeated visits.",1395705600,,1654,4.177215189873418
5607976,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Interesting story all the way through.  It is especially interesting when one knows the Mary Poppins movie by heart.  I only rented this movie but I'm going to buy it too, it's one worth owning to watch over and over.",1395705600,,217,4.4

5607978,5,B00BEIYSL4,This was a great movie and really provides an appreciation for what transpired to bring Mary Poppins to life.  It also showed how Walt Disney's personality was able to make it happen and the degree of patience he had.  His vision and desire to make Mary Poppins a household name was truly remarkable.  The movie also provided you with a great deal of respect for the author who was very much attached to Mary Poppins.  Highly recommended for all audiences.,1395705600,,456,4.6625
5607979,5,B00BEIYSL4,Wonderful! ( to coin Mr. Disney) Should have recieved a better look from the academy. Hanks was a  very belivable Disney,1395705600,,120,4.714285714285714

5607984,1,B00BEIYSL4,Quite possibly the weakest premise to produce a movie ever!  Emma Thompson is insufferable as P L  Travers.

5608000,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Right from the beginning of this film,  Emma Thompson set the stage of what was shaping her person-hood.  I, personally,  find the use of ""flashbacks"" very interesting and an efficient way of bringing the viewer alongside her journey.

Once Tom Hanks came into the picture,  it was clear we're going to witness an interesting evolution of both characters.  Suffice to say, it could not have been populated by a better cast.  Each character that came into this journey had just the right influence; revealing some of their own strengths (& foibles), and allowing a subtle healing, and deeper understanding, without beating us over the head with it.

Heartwarming, without being sappy; you can't help but end the film with a smile on your face.  Highly recommended for the family IF the children are mature enough to understand personal dynamics.",1395705600,,844,5.014388489208633

5608002,5,B00BEIYSL4,I really loved this movie.  I love background information on people and their work.  I am a therapist and understand trauma and grief intimately.  This movie nailed it and in very Disney fashion gave it a worthy positive ending.  A winner all around.,1395705600,,250,4.744186046511628
5608003,5,B00BEIYSL4,Tom Hanks in anything is tremendous.  As is Emma - they are just a joy to watch in this movie!  It's not a comedy - and not a children's movie. But great adult entertainment.,1395705600,,174,4.088235294117647
5608004,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I was very interested in learning the background of how Mary Poppins came into being......not just from the view of Disney Studios and how they made the movie, but about P. L. Travers, herself. This movie is very touching. You get a real look at what Mrs. Travers went through as a child and understand how she came up with the wonderful books! This movie is a very caring take on how Mr. Disney respected Mrs. Travers family - Mr. & Mrs. Banks, the children, The Bank and all the other wonderful characters she created! It is definitely more a movie of Mrs. Travers coming to an understanding of what happened to her and her real family and why she wrote the books. Though she had a very hard time coming to grips with songs and animated penguins, in the end she understood that this movie, Mary Poppins, shows exactly what she wanted.....Mr. Banks coming into his own with his loving family!",1395705600,,893,4.518518518518518

Of course, you really need to see Mary Poppins before seeing this.",1395705600,,275,4.46
5608016,4,B00BEIYSL4,Beautifully done.  Glad Walt Disney was so persistent in getting the story for his children.  The book shows how the author coped with her life.,1395705600,,144,4.72
5608017,3,B00BEIYSL4,"While it was interesting to see how unconventional the author of ""Mary Poppins"" really was, the movie has a lot of sadness in it. It's not something I'd see more than once. P.L. Travers had a very pathetic childhood, and I couldn't bear to live thru it a second time. Same goes for hearing about Walt Disney's sad childhood. The movie does have some funny parts and is very well done, but it's not something you'll want to see again and again.",1395705600,,443,4.414634146341464

This movie is as forced and artificial as a high-school production of a second-rate play. Nothing in it is believable--at least not in the first half hour; and I refuse to watch more. Thompson's character charges forth as an outright bitch, presumably so that she can come around toward actual humanity before the curtains close. Hanks, Giamatti and Whitford--all of whom are capable of brilliance--are about as subtle as a toilet seat. The actors aren't at fault. It's the script and the direction. This film repels the viewer rather than drawing him in.  The interleaved flashback scenes of the author as a turn-of-the-century child are treacly. If I'd had insulin, I would have mainlined it. Viewer beware!

Although I didn't count, I believe that Thomson's character repeats (in the first 30 minutes of the film!) the same statement a half-dozen times: ""I am Mrs. Travers, NOT  Pamela!"" This is a failure of imagination by the screenwriter, who was clearly grasping for any words with which to fill the sound track at this point in the narrative.",1395619200,4,1212,4.87378640776699

But as someone who grew up as her daddy's girl, and suffered later in life for being his pet, I really related to that aspect of the story.
Not going to review the performances or technical aspects as others have done; all I'm going to say is if you want to watch a movie about how a beloved Disney movie came to be this is well worth your time.

It is a pleasure to see a wonderfully written, cast, and filmed story set in the studio during some of its golden years.  Happily, the depiction of the early 1960's opts for accuracy, not caricature.  Tom Hanks underplays Walt in this movie and his screen time is too short.  However, what we do get to see is a joy.

Emma Thompson surely deserved an Academy Award for her role as Mrs. Travers.  All the other characters on the screen become her foils.  At first viewing, the story seems simple, but beneath the surface is a great deal of subtlety and irony.  Much is conveyed non-verbally, both in the flashbacks and 60's scenes.

The screenwriters use their best devices to justify, humanize, and sympathize Mrs. Travers.  But viewers who live on a day to day basis with a man or woman with an attitude like P.L. Travers in the next cubicle may squirm in their seats.

How does one respond to the triumphs and tragedies of one's own life?  Many of us know persons of limited means who are gracious, while others who receive great opportunities choose to be negative.

Now, Disney, why did this NOT come out in a blu ray and DVD package?  I was totally disappointed in that, meaning I have to buy another package just to get the DVD.

It is portrayed with honest and sweetness.  It will break your heart at times as the characters unfold with their own personal life stories and history of P.L. Travers in her youth at a time of difficulty.

The short production of the music is touching.  I play piano so I think I will try to find the music that was written for the Mary Poppins movie.  The music genius is shown by the playful writers who were successful in getting Mrs. Travers to allow the movie to be a musical production.  I can't imagine Mary Poppins without the beautiful music that gave the magic to the story.

The life of Mrs. Travers in her youth apparently was the inspiration for the Mary Poppins story.  Her early youth was filled with tragedy and the arrival of Mary Poppins in her life (the aunt) eased her pain during that awful time.

See the movie to discover all the magic of the Walt Disney movie in its production.  It is time well spent.  It will make you cry.

5608167,5,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" was not the film I expected it to be.  The advertisements of it depict a paternal Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) butting heads futilely with a headstrong British matron, P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), about translating her children's book to the big screen.  The impression you get is this is a comedy with some dramatic overtones.  Nothing could cut further from the truth because this film tackles deeper themes.  It's about adults who channel their energies into their work to accelerate the healing process from early childhood traumas.  When the film begins Travers is introduced to Disney's creative team and she digs her heels in objecting to anything contradictory to her aesthetic of Mary Poppins.  The film flashes back and forth from these sessions to her childhood in Australia.  As work progresses on the projected film the protective defenses that Travers has erected begin to evaporate as she recalls her childhood calamities.  When Travers storms out of the Disney offices allegedly in a snit over artistic differences it is then that Disney surmises that Travers created Mary Poppins to protect her from life's cruelties.  ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is nothing short of brilliant casting similar magic that the ""Mary Poppins"" film cast in 1964.  The film is meticulous in unraveling the two decade long mystery as to why Travers denied Disney the film rights to Mary Poppins and why she was so protective of her creation.  I can't fathom why the picture or Thompson were not nominated for Oscars this year.  This film is certainly better than the sterile and overrated ""Gravity"".  ""Saving Mr. Banks"" has a resonance that's lacking in most films.  I was curious why this film was rated PG-13 considering that ""Mary Poppins"" was the ultimate general audience film.  There are thematic elements in the film that would probably be a little unsettling to younger audiences but nothing remotely offensive.  I've never read the Mary Poppins books but I'm a long time fan of the film.  I was fortunate enough to see the Broadway production in 2007.",1395532800,10,2060,5.011764705882353

5608203,4,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" should have been a great film. It comes close to being a classic but poor pacing and making the lead character too unsympathetic for way too long undermines the movie. While still a good film, when it was over, I kept thinking the movie blew its chance of being a classic.

The movie tells a powerful story and there are some excellent performances here. Emma Thompson is, as always, wonderful. Tom Hanks does a fine job as Walt Disney. Best of all, he offers a natural performance instead of merely doing an imitation. There are moving performances by Paul Giametti  and Colin Ferrell. The movie has some solid points about parents and art and some of the moments are touching, insightful and funny.

But the movie's pacing is off. There are too many flashbacks, some of which seemed redundant and others which went on too long, that hurt the flow of the movie. The lead character is way too unsympathetic at the start of the film--even mocking one of the Sherman brothers for using a cane after he was shot (he was wounded in World War Two which could have been explained in the film). The second half of the film is much better when it comes to pacing but still relies on too many flashbacks.

This is a good film to be sure. It's moving and there are some very strong performances. But ""Saving Mr. Banks"" came so close to being a great film that I was left a little disappointed in it. Had the pacing been a little stronger, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" would be seen as a classic.",1395532800,,1494,4.461538461538462

Travers' childhood to the 1960s when she was brought to Hollywood by Walt Disney. The excellent Emma Thompson is at her best as Travers, who wants no part of Disney's cartoons and happy songs. Tom Hanks conveys Walt Disney's charm but also clearly shows his iron fist in a velvet glove. His employees treat him with a fear-tinged awe. It's very much oil-and-water; everything about the Americans annoys the very staid British author. The flashback scenes reveal pieces of the puzzle that came together as the series of treasured stories that have delighted readers for generations but now are best known from Disney's well-loved film. Colin Farrell does some of his best work as the charming father with serious character flaws. Annie Rose Buckley is heart-breaking as little Helen, whose love is powerless to save her father. Rachel Griffiths as Aunt Ellie is a key figure in the development of the entire story. My favorite scenes took place in the studio with the Sherman brothers and the film's writer (Jason Schwartzman, B.J. Novak and Bradley Whitford) turning themselves inside out trying to win Travers' appproval, but also those in the limousine with the chauffeur Ralph (Paul Giamatti) whose sunny optimism so grates on Mrs. Travers.

As clearly as this film strives to delineate the emotional issues involved in Ms. Travers upbringing, the most significant issue, revealed at the end, the root of all else which transpires, is held either nicely, or falsely, in check.

5608277,5,B00BEIYSL4,"When a movie like ""Saving Mr. Banks"" comes along, with it's nostalgic warmth, heart, humor, beautiful cinematography, and all around old school magic, we should embrace it, because they don't make 'em like this too much anymore. It's definitely a valentine to Disney lovers and movie lovers in general.

""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a beautiful movie that takes place in both 1961 and, in flashbacks, in Australia in the early 1900s. The movie is about how the legendary film 'Mary Poppins' was made. It was a long (20 yrs!) and hard road. Emma Thompson stars as author P.L. Travers, who has not been interested in giving in to Walt Disney to film her precious books. But now, due to financial reasons, she gives in and decides to go to Los Angeles to see what happens. There, she constantly locks heads with the man himself (Tom Hanks), and the rest of his crew and staff. Demanding, picky and intolerant of most everything, Travers and Disney try to work together to finally get this movie on the screen.

A lot of people have their opinions on Walt Disney and if this story is even 100% true. I do not know the history. Only from what I have seen in this movie. Taken on it's own, as a movie, SMB is a masterful piece of filmmaking. cast-wise, Emma Thompson is perfectly cast as Travers. She makes us feel the coldness that Travers displays when we first meet her and follow her through the film, and makes us feel (and maybe cry) by the end. The jumping around the timeline to her childhood in the early 1900s, and back to present day 1960s, is expertly done and weaves in seamlessly to what is presently going on in her world. It wonderfully explains where she came from and how she came to be the way she is. As for Mr. Hanks, you will have no problem beliving he is Disney. Hanks has really delivered a one-two punch this past year with this film and ""Captain Phillips"", the best streak he's had since the 90s. You forget you are watching Tom Hanks, and believe he is Uncle Walt, truly doing what he loves. The supporting cast, including Bradley Whitford, Colin Farrell and Paul Giamatti, also shine. It is a wonderful collection of actors. It is nearly impossible to not be completely and utterly moved by a few of these performances.

From the real Disney studio lot, to actually filming in Disneyland, SMB also shines because of this authenticity. It feels and looks rich with it's own history. Director John Lee Hancock and his cinematographer don't hold back in making this a beautiful movie in the grand, old Hollywood style. Even though you have Travers' cynicism and biting remarks, it is a wonderfully happy movie, full with optimism and sentimentality. Don't let the hard, cold cynical critics and people of the world let you think that nostalgia and sentimentality is a bad thing. It's every bit as real and realistic as the harsh, gritty 'realistic' movies of today. There is wonderfulness in the world, and in the movies, and people want it.

In the end, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is my favorite movie of 2013 by far, and definitely one of my top 5 favorite movies of the 2010s. No doubt. It's old school movie magic released in a medium where it seems like that is few and far between. Maybe the warm reception the movie got will make Hollywood take notice. It's an absolute shame that this movie was mostly overlooked by the Oscars. This movie is an absolute gem.",1395360000,,3371,4.585406301824213

I can't imagine Disney was as generous and patient as portrayed at the same time I don't have any doubt Travers came off as nasty as she was depicted. As an author, it's a dream for me to have someone put my story on screen, at the same time I dread something like Memoirs of A Geisha or some other terrible adaptation. I empathize with holding onto the integrity of the story. Honestly, as a late 70's early 80's kid, there were several other books on my obsessive reading radar. Disney's Mary Poppins was my first and only Poppins exposure, so I may be biased. I still love the film even though my kids are grown and almost launched.
Emma Thompson captured Travers's tightly wound, hyper critical side too perfectly because I almost didn't finish the film. If Travers's childhood was portrayed truthfully, her personality is understandable. Many have tried to soften her portrayal, but when a family member says, ""She died without loving anyone and no one loved her."" Well, it's no wonder the character caused me such friction.

My Computer is a little old and for some reason i can't seem to access this Movie on the Website.  I like to watch Movies on my Television not my Computer.

5608355,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks will have a special appeal to those with a particular interest in films in which past and present are inextricably mingled.  Most people instinctively understand that their past life affects, sometimes decisively, their present reality, but most of us but are seldom confronted with the evidence in any explicit form. Certain films, like certain works of literature, bring us to this realization.

In Saving Mr. Banks, the author P. L. Travers, author of the famous Mary Poppins books, travels from her home in London to Los Angeles in 1961 to meet with Walt Disney and the team he has assembled in the hopes of bringing the story of her famous flying nanny to the big screen. Travers is reluctant to turn over the rights to her characters, whom she thinks of as her family, for fear of what might become of them in the hands of Disney. As we discover through flashbacks to her childhood in Australia during the Edwardian era, Travers has good reasons for her protective stance, since her books are based on the lives of real family members. This is especially true in the case of her charming and beloved, but highly unstable, father, on whom the character of Mr. Banks is loosely based, and her aunt who arrived, like Mary Poppins, to try to set things in order.  Saving Mr. Banks alternates between the two eras, as Travers, the mature woman, must confront her girlhood memories which the planned film of her book oblige her to dredge up.  It's a difficult and often painful process, in which long-suppressed feelings are brought to light, and cherished assumptions are re-examined in a critical manner.

This movie reminded me of another film, brought out in 1985, called Dreamchild. It also tells a story which is based on historical fact, that of the visit to America made by Alice Liddell Hargreaves, in the year 1932.  It was she who, as a child in Victorian England, inspired Lewis Carroll to write his famous Alice in Wonderland as a sort of tribute and a gift to her. Though her memories of that period in her life are mostly faded by the time she makes her American voyage at the age of 80, she, like Travis, is compelled to recall them, as the American public and the press hound her for details of her life as ""little Alice.""  Again, like Travis, many of the details which were long buried in her subconscious are painful for her to re-examine, owing to the complicated nature of her feelings toward the man who immortalized her in his writing.

Of the two films, I think that Dreamchild does the better job of juxtaposing the scenes of past and present in the lives of the main female characters. It is clearer in the earlier film why the memories of the past have been so long suppressed and how the events in the life of the girl so many decades earlier have come to shape the life of the woman she has evolved into.  However, I can well imagine that someone else might feel the opposite, and believe that Saving Mr. Banks is the more satisfying film in that respect.  I would have to say that both do well, and my preference for Dreamchild, overall, is not meant to take away from the achievements of Saving Mr. Banks as a film about the mysterious ways in which memory works and about the lasting hold which the past can have over the present.",1395273600,,3279,4.580204778156997
5608356,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Breathtaking. An inspiring tale and a masterpiece. Tom Hanks gave his truly best and went above and beyond anything he's ever done in the role of the legend himself. Emma Thompson was equally incredible.

Best yet as I sat watching this with my mother, my sister and her baby girl, was how we could all stand and sing and dance to Fly A Kite during the film. That such a Disney movie can draw people to their feet to sing and dance still is indescribable.  This is a the Disney film we all fell in love with and keep coming back to.",1395273600,,532,4.205882352941177
5608367,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Tom Hanks is good playing Disney.
Emma Thompson is blimey brilliant.
Leave it to Disney to make a drama documentary about the making of ""Mary Poppins."" It's as magical as Fantasyland; as delicious as a spoonful of sugar; a classic about THE classic. Experienced all realms of emotions.
Forget rental, if you own a ""Mary Poppins"" DVD; then this DVD of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" must be on the shelf next to it. In front of, like the prequel.
I grew up with Walt Disney's TV and movie beginnings. As a father, Disney entertained my children as it did myself at their age. My grandchildren watch my collection of the old hits (and new.) I was in high school when Poppins hit the big screen, sat with my boys watching it on TV, and bought my grand-kids the Anniversary Edition. Mary Poppins is ageless.
Bottom line:
""Saving Mr. Banks"" is as good as ""Mary Poppins.""

5608397,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is the embellished story of the uneasy collaboration between Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his creative team. Disney mounts an extravagant charm offensive to secure the rights to the authors famous creation.

Travers is depicted as cantankerous, argumentative, rigid, and highly protective of her magical nanny. She also has little knowledge of the movie-making process, which becomes a difficult problem for Disney himself and his beleaguered staff. They are doing their best to wine and dine her, but she is wary of losing control and letting the studio turn Mary Poppins into just one more in a long line of animated features.

Ms. Thompson and Mr. Hanks both do a fine job, though its hard not to suspect quite a bit of Disney-fying of the characters as well as the story. We see long stretches in flashback of Travers youth in Australia and the devoted relationship with her father (Colin Farrell), who loved to spin yarns. But lifes hard knocks have molded her into a cold, arrogant, condescending presence who intimidates and even frightens those whose only goal is to make a good movie. Disney, in contrast, is depicted as all heart. The character of Ralph (Paul Giamatti), the chauffeur assigned to Travers in California, is on hand as a humanizing device. His soft-spoken manner and his personal burden helps put Travers concerns about Mary Poppins in perspective.

If you know a bit about P.L. Travers' background, you will see that the facts of her life have often been skewed in the film to polish the image of the Disney machine and Walt himself. However, the movie is entertaining in its own right and offers a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a certifiable classic.

The Blu-ray edition contains deleted scenes, a tour of the Disney Studio, reminiscences by Disney employees who worked with Travers, and a tribute to composer Richard Sherman with a rousing rendition of Lets Go Fly a Kite by cast and crew.",1395187200,3,1997,4.916913946587537

The movie was great and  fantastically unpredictable - EVEN if you think you know the story. The unpredictability was one of the things I really loved. Emma Thompson was super great! Tom Hanks was also super great! The underlying family story of Mrs. Travers is what's so compelling. Wish this had won Best Picture - it so deserved it. Watch it...even if you think you know what the movie is about... ya don't!,1395100800,,508,4.571428571428571

5608402,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This is my favorite film of the year (which, granted, isn't saying a lot, because most movies these days are dreck.) But this was a charmer from beginning to end. The period details were wonderful and the characterizations truly fun. Tom Hanks is excellent (Tom Hanks is invariably excellent.) The only problem I had with him in this role is that he's Tom Hanks. It was difficult to really see Walt Disney in him because I was too conscious of him being Tom Hanks. And Walt Disney was such a larger than life personality, himself, I think an unknown actor might have been better in the role. This isn't Tom Hanks' fault, of course, and he was fun to watch. I just couldn't quite see past him to recognize Walt Disney, the man.

Emma Thompson was perfection. Pamela Travers was, I'm sure, no easy personality to recreate. Emma Thompson brought out all her sharp angles in a believable way, but let us see some vulnerability underneath (and I believe she did this from her very first scene, though I seem to be in the minority in that opinion.) She was set in her ways (and so was Disney) so naturally they clashed. She had the additional struggle of trying to be taken seriously as a female author AND the pain of trying to make the folks at Disney understand her vision and bring it to life as she saw it. I don't blame Travers for being upset with the idea of penguins and Dick van Dyke and all those other changes. As cute as the film version of Mary Poppins turned out, it's watered-down pablum compared to the sharp, vivid edge in the actual books. My heart goes out to Travers. I don't think they did her magnificent stories justice, and I wish this had been a little clearer in the movie.

But the movie is more a valentine to Disney than Travers and though both characters are allowed a sympathetic edge, Disney is portrayed as the good guy from start to finish. I don't find that entirely fair, but I can't deny I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. It was really interesting to see the creative processes of all these talented people, especially the songwriters. I think a movie exploring the lives of the Sherman brothers would be really fascinating, too.

All in all, this was beautifully acted, intelligent, charming entertainment for grown-ups (yay, because entertainment like that is almost impossible to find these days) and though it could have been as interesting (and probably even more so) if it had been more historically accurate, I have to give it the full five stars because I enjoyed it so much.",1395100800,2,2514,4.557522123893805

Instead I found it to be much better - particularly the flashback scenes of Australia (Colin Farrell's performance was nicely understated). Seeing how elements of the author's life had been put into the story of Mary Poppins made me see Mary Poppins from another, deeper level. Kudos go to Emma Thompson for managing to inject her dry humor into scenes that might otherwise make you hate her character. And Thomas Newman's music is haunting, as always. I didn't find out until after I saw this how inaccurate this movie was about the creation of the Mary Poppins script, but even knowing that, I still got a lot out of it.",1395100800,2,719,4.538461538461538
5608405,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is a masterpiece of filmmaking.  Hollywood should be proud of producing this film and presenting it to the worldwide theater audience.  Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson have set the acting bar higher than anyone in Tinseltown has attempted in a long, long while.  If you appreciate great craftsmanship in acting, look no further.  If you appreciate great detail in creating a bygone era, in this case the nineteen sixties, look no further.  And, this is most important, if you appreciate the greatest, and I sincerely mean this, ensemble acting every delivered on the silver screen, run and do not walk to your retailer and buy your DVD or Blue Ray edition of this movie.

Sit down in the warm confines of your abode, put out the popcorn and the snacks, grab a hankie or two, and enjoy a film that will be held in very high regard throughout the ages.  For all the complainers who think great acting and remarkable and thought provoking films created with great aplomb are extinct, purchase this film and realize that there are filmmakers both in front and behind the camera who can produce a film devoid of profanity and cynicism.  We have learned how to view all kinds of behaviors but this film returns us to those days of John Ford and, my hero, Frank Capra.  This is a story of the heart and it is time we gave our hearts that much needed emotional tune-up.

If I sound over the top in this critique, so be it.  I love this film, I have put it in my Top Ten List of all time and I thank everybody connected in producing it.  To each and everyone concerned, I extend my eternal gratitude.  Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson have reached the cinema heights and the supporting cast will remembered throughout the ages.

5608406,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I've been a fan of Walt Disney for many years and while I know he wasn't always ""Uncle Walt"" he was not the monster that some try to convey every chance they get. Walt Disney was a salesman, artist, storyteller, visionary.... the list goes on and I would like to think he was a pretty good guy. I say this because even though I've done my research, I didn't know him personally.(and nether did any of the people who seem to want only to tarnish his legacy!)

The Disney company however is a completely different animal and I loathe what they have done to this man's company. This film which I found very entertaining may be or may not be true and unless you were there in the room you probably should just keep your mouth shut on the subject. I'm sure there were liberties taken with the facts of this situation, but that is Hollywood folks liberties are taken with a grain of salt.

Okay, on to the film itself. I liked this movie, I found it to be true at its core, sure it probably didn't all happen the way we see it on screen, but we go to movies to be entertained. Tom Hanks gives a good portrayal of a man I think would be hard to portray. Walt Disney is so well known it is hard to get his image out of your mind. I thought the fact that they showed Walt hiding his smoking from the public and hearing him cough from time to time in this film was a nice little character embellishment and showing the writing on the wall for Walt's fate to come in just a few years after Poppins was released.  Thompson and Giamatti are also good here, but while I found this film enjoyable I would have rather have seen a film about Walt and Roy Disney and this particular situation just a piece of that film.

Tha Disney brothers have a story that should be told and now that this film has seen some success, maybe someone will see what a great movie there is to be made, hopefully we'll see some of the not so whitewashed parts of their lives too because regardless of these things Walt Disney brought more happiness to the world than most anyone can claim, even if he was a shrewd businessman.

It is a story of unconditional familial love.

I've come to the conclusion that Tom Hanks is a superb judge of the type of film I, an old Midwestern guy, will enjoy.  I cannot recall a film Tom Hanks was associated with that I did not like.

To get it over quickly, let's talk about those cons first. Then the pros. The main con I have with the film is about a little something called character arcs. Storywriting 101 says that your main character has to have an arc throughout the narrative - he/she has to change or grow. Ms. Travers did not. She began the film an insufferable dweeb, and remained an insufferable dweeb for the duration of the film.

5608426,3,B00BEIYSL4,"In itself, it was a modestly interesting movie about the clash of titanic personalities that finally led to the Mary Poppins movie: hard-driving Disney vs. eccentric and hard-headed Travers. Bits of back-story, from Travers's Australian childhood filled in and supported the ongoing tussle, and eventually explained Travers's adamant insistence on so many details. And, as happens so often, it ends in a compromise of sorts, the kind where not everyone gets everything they want.

I have to wonder, though, about the historical accuracy of Disney's struggle for movie rights as told by a Disney studio. One is left to speculate how it might have looked it told from the Travers side. Although I might have rservations about the series of events as a whole, a few points seem to have uncommon authenticity. Travers insisted on recording the working sessions, and the surviving recordings give a very precise foundation for parts of the script.

I found it somewhat interesting, on the whole, but forgettable in the end.

I also rented and loved the documentary THE BOYS, about the Sherman Brothers who wrote the songs for the Disney film.

My favorite scene in SAVING MR. BANKS is when Disney walks into the studio and overhears Richard Sherman quietly singing ""Feed the Birds""...just finding the melody for the first time. When it ends, Disney murmurs ""Yeah...That'll work.""  It always remained his favorite song in the film, and this little scene helps us realize what a simple, beautiful tune it is...and quite in the spirit of Travers' chapter ""The Bird Woman"" in the first POPPINS book.",1393372800,2,1069,4.621052631578947

5608464,5,B00BEIYSL4,"What a beautiful, touchingly poignant, and uplifting film.  1960s SoCal is colorfully recreated in an idyllic shimmer, reminiscent of those blissful and unspoiled Ozzie and Harriet days.  And  to affectionately borrow the term  legendary imagineers of timeless filmmaking are resurrected and portrayed before our very eyes by an equally celebrated cast and crew.  A number of movers and shakers from the early Walt Disney Studios are wonderfully brought to life, including the Sherman brothers who wrote the Mary Poppins musical songs, one of whom served as musical consultant for this film.  Walt Disney himself is cleverly and consummately played by Tom Hanks, and Emma Thompson has once again taken on a roll so well that its hard to imagine anyone else doing it justice.  Shes just so likable, ya know?
The wardrobes, costumes, set designs, and hairstyles are delightful and superbly true to the era.  The musical score is simultaneously stirring and cheerful.  Notable among the excellent cadre of supporting actors is Paul Giammati, who appears as one of Walt Disneys chauffeurs.
Now for the story itself:  one word  WOW.  (Ok, maybe more than one word)  This is one of those rare stories that you hope movie studios take the time to tell, and to tell it right.  And Disney truly delivered.  The viewer gets the overwhelming sensation of peering into the highly personal story behind a guarded (and allegedly lonely) life of a very private literary great, P.L. Travers, who wrote the Mary Poppins childrens novels.  (For those not wanting any more details, consider this your spoiler alert.)  Her tale picks up where she is considering selling the film rights to Walt Disney, something the cartoonist had been trying to secure from her for two decades.  Its highly personal for both parties  Disney made a promise to his daughters to bring the famous nanny to life on screen, and Travers doesnt want to see her beloved creations altered in any way (though butchered might be nearer the mark, in her mind). Travers proves just as complicated, stiff, and impossible to please as ever, and yet, Thompson plays her in a way that the viewer empathizes with her every emotion.  Much of her prickliness has to do with the backstory of her doting father, and her love for him  he is played by Colin Farrell, and although Travers' real life father has been somewhat coldly described as an ""unsuccessful banker by historians, his character tends to remind us that some people are just too good for this world, in the best sense.
After Travers is ever so delicately coaxed into flying to California to negotiate the film rights, the only person who seems to disarm her off-putting facade is the aforementioned chauffeur, Ralph (Giammatti), and we get to see a thoughtful, caring, and personable side to her.  There are some really funny moments peppered throughout, partly because Travers finds America and its citizens lifestyle so abhorrent to her very English manners and sensibilities.
I won't share any more spoilers, but I will say that the premise behind the title of the movie was very surprising and clever;  I had thought that this movie would be about making sure a fictional character, or his integrity, stays intact in Walt Disneys adaptation of ""Mary Poppins.
The real story offers so much more beyond my preexisting expectations.  The performances and the production will bring a smile to your face, and your heart will be warmed.  This is a movie worth seeing.",1393113600,18,3471,4.963667820069205

Walt could barely draw Micky Mouse...was not an artist in the animation/animator sense...but he certainly had A Lot of creative Energy/Ability.

The movie was wonderfully acted and without issue on that front.  I only saw it once and decided I'd be purchasing it and so I did just that (I'm now awaiting it's release).  I'll enjoy watching it again with my 28 year old daughter who did not get to the theaters to see it and I know she'll love it as well.

5608481,3,B00BEIYSL4,"When it comes to great actors, Tom Hanks is definitely at the top. His outstanding performance in ""Captain Phillips"" last year blew me away, and reinvigorated my love for him. However, his role as Walt Disney in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" isn't what people have been buzzing about. Emma Thompson is the standout actress in this awards-season frontrunner that has really gotten people talking.

The story centers on P.L. Travers, played by Thompson, the acclaimed author of `Mary Poppins'. Twenty years after the book's initial release, Disney approaches her for the rights to make a film adaptation. Travers reluctantly agrees to travel to Los Angeles and hear his plans. For two short weeks, we see the early stages of one of the most classic films ever made.

Though I enjoyed the story and interaction between Hanks and Thompson, I didn't fully get behind this movie. With boring and unnecessary flashbacks to Travers' childhood, the movie is a bit derailed. Emma Thompson is fantastic and provides much of the comedic relief, but the film's pacing is slow and unbalanced. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" starts out fun and interesting, but doesn't quite deliver.",1392163200,3,1180,5.077319587628866
5608482,4,B00BEIYSL4,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The Walt Disney Company's ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a perfectly fine film, detailing the making of Disney's(mostly)live-action classic ""Mary Poppins.""  Starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, it is an old-fashioned feel-good live-action Disney movie for the modern age.

Ms. Thompson is arresting as the salty P.L. Travers, whose battles with Walt Disney(an uncharacteristically hackneyed Tom Hanks), set the stage for a tired, formulaic plot.  The movie's true triumph is the detailed glimpses of Travers' childhood home in Australia, and touchingly creative fluorishes of ""Poppins"" music.  Specifically, the movie makes excellent use of ""Winds in the East,"" and ""Let's Go Fly A Kite.""

Emma Thompson gives a spectacular performance as author P. L. Travers.  It's blatantly wrong that she was overlooked for a nomination as Best Actress.  Colin Farrell is similarly brilliant, giving arguably his best performance in years as Travers Goff, the author's loving, complicated father.  Tom Hanks is a nearly unfailingly luminous actor in almost every role he takes on.  His acting in last year's ""Captain Phillips"" ranks among the best of his storied career on the big screen.  Here, he is completely miscast as Walt Disney.  He never really seems natural playing the animator and entertainment mogul.  In the early scenes, his vocal inflections even remind me of his Santa Claus character in The Polar Express.  Tom Hanks is a huge personality.  Walt Disney was a huge personality, and the two could never mesh for me.  An unknown may have been able to fade into the Walt Disney role more completely.

Despite my above complaints, I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  It can be viewed as a prequel to ""Mary Poppins,"" and even provides its own insights and a welcome freshness for that great movie.",1392163200,,1809,5.222222222222222
5608483,3,B00BEIYSL4,"Who new P.L. Travers the lady who wrote Mary Poppins was such a bitch?

Emma Thompson captured brilliantly the essence of this broken woman and all her painful bitterness. The rest of Saving Mister Banks is a glossy Disney trip into a made up reality about creating a movie classic that PL Travers, in reality, hated: 'She didn't like the way it was all smiles and Julie was so sweet and of course Dick Van Dyke was atrocious, every one agrees on that. She thought all the real magic had been taken out and that it had been Disneyfied.''

Expecting a fluffy Disney-esque romp, I was stunned to experience a fascinating story of Walt Disney's courting of the author of the Mary Poppins book in order to bring it to the screen. This was an intensely emotional film in the same vein as some of the great films of years past. I had forgotten that before today's feast of violence and adrenelin rush there were thoughtful, emotional films about people, feelings, and their internal emotional lives. I am not ashamed to say that there was a moment when a few tears rolled down my cheeks, as Emma Thompson slowly peeled away layers of her past creating the multilayered character of the author PL Travis.",1391904000,,708,4.717741935483871
5608507,4,B00BEIYSL4,"I very much like the works of Tom Hanks, but my wife gets gooey at the mere mention of his name so seeing this was a given. We were not disappointed.

Here's the scoop. Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) wants to film Mary Poppins but needs the book's author, P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), to sign off on the rights. She's desperately in need of the dough but has a severe disdain for the Disney machine and figures he'll ruin her work. He flies her to L.A. to try and change her mind. What a bumpy road it is.

This is a truly wonderful movie. Hanks is good as Disney. He shows the patience of Job and consistently bends to the wishes of Travers but there seems to be no winning. They juxtapose this scenario with slices of her story as a young girl in Australia. It was a rough life. Her dad's (Colin Ferrel) head was in the clouds and it hurt the family. But his cloudy-headedness seems to be what drove her to be an author. Watching B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as Robert and Richard Sherman running through the song writing process was also a lot of fun. I always enjoy Paul Giamatti and though he doesn't have much of a role here he presents a very likable character who actually helps sway the stalemate.

This is a very good production. Great attention is paid to period detail and it helps whisk the audience back to the 60's. Well directed, shot and edited, this is a real slick piece of work with some very touching moments. For my dollar this is a must see for an movie buff.",1391212800,2,1480,4.297491039426523

5608512,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I was hesitant to see ""Saving Mr. Banks"" initially. I expected a story that wouldn't necessarily be exciting. I did expect some good performances, that one might expect from a pedigreed cast that includes Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, but I wasn't expecting to be particularly engaged in the story or the characters.

John Lee Hancock directed one of the best loved films of the last ten years - Sandra Bullock's ""The Blind Side"". That was a big film that inspired lots of movie-theater crying and spontaneous ending applause. It's nice that I'm able to say that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is right up the same alley.

We follow ice queen P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the original ""Mary Poppins"" stories. When her accountant informs her that she is on the verge of bankruptcy, she decides to finally consider, after twenty years of non-starter conversations, to sell the rights from her stories to Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to make the now classic ""Mary Poppins"" film. Through flashbacks, we are informed of her childhood, the father who she loved, despite his constantly disappointing her. We also get a glimpse of what gave her the inspiration for the classic character she wrote, and why she holds her character so dear.

Thompson gives a bravura performance here, in a character that nobody else could've played as well. Her character is hard to like, but impossible not to love by the end. She and Hanks have excellent chemistry, as their characters are polar opposites of one another.

Travers is a miserable woman who is overly critical, rude and generally unpleasant. We don't like her at the beginning, but her character becomes very rich, and by the end, we understand her and can't help but adore her. Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney in a way that reminded me of SAG president Ken Howard's character of Hank Hooper on the show ""30 Rock"". He's a man of enormous power and wealth who's just a big `ol softie at heart. He's the perfect yin to Thompson's yang, and you'll only wish they would have had more scenes together.

""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a backstage drama and a character study, and both of these work gloriously together in the film. Boasted by lovely supporting characters, and a narrative that never lulls along for too long, ""Mr. Banks"" feels like a breath of fresh air and a blast from the past all at the same time. Don't miss it.

5608516,3,B00BEIYSL4,"""Savings Mr. Banks"" is worth seeing for Emma Thompson's peerless performance as ""Mary Poppins"" author PL Travers. That Thompson was not nominated for a best actor Academy Award is a crime. Thompson's performance is one of the most compelling and convincing performances I've ever seen.

Thompson plays PL Travers as a witch, and I'm using the nice version of the word. You know what word I really mean. Thompson's Travers is thoroughly believable. This isn't a cartoon villainess. This isn't Cruella DaVille or Maleficent. This is a woman you could imagine having as a boss or a neighbor. You'd do everything you could to avoid her. She doesn't learn any lesson. She doesn't reveal that we are all warm and fuzzy if you just get close enough.

Some have criticized ""Saving Mr. Banks"" for this reason. They say that it's sexist to depict a successful woman author as being a witch. Baloney. It would be sexist to depict her as warm and cuddly. Women can be unpleasant. I know plenty of women like Travers. It isn't liberated to insist that all women are nice. Plenty of women are not nice at all.

I found Thompson's depiction of Travers to be so powerful that the rest of the film didn't measure up, for me. Part of the film takes place in 1961. Travers is in Hollywood, working with Disney studios on their film adaptation of her book ""Mary Poppins."" Part of the film is a series of flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. In the flashbacks, Colin Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic father. The flashbacks didn't work for me. They had the feel of an afterschool special. Everyone was so good looking, especially Colin Farrell, even while suffering the health effects of alcoholism. Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the author as a child, is cherubically beautiful. The scenes depicting the alcoholic father disappointing and humiliating his daughter, and breaking her heart, did not affect me at all. They felt paint-by-numbers  oh, this is the predictable scene where the little girl realizes her father is a loser.

The 1961 scenes in Hollywood worked much better. Paul Giamatti is amazing in the small part of Travers' limo driver. He brings a wallop of humanity and poignancy to his role that really swept me off my feet. The two develop a real rapport, and they could have taken up much more of the film. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are also brilliant as Robert and Richard Sherman, who wrote the songs for Mary Poppins. In one scene, Travers objects to Robert Sherman's walking with a cane. The film doesn't mention this; I wish it had. Sherman was only 19 or 20 years old when he participated in the liberation of Dachau. He was shot during the war. That's why he walked with a cane.

Tom Hanks as Walt Disney didn't really work for me. Walt Disney was a totemic figure from my childhood. I remember him, in his TV appearances, as rather godlike  avuncular and yet distant, impenetrable. While watching Emma Thompson as PL Travers, I got the sense that I was watching something like the real PL Travers  a real, complex, human being. While watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, I got the sense that I was watching Tom Hanks play a sanitized version of Walt Disney. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" was very brave in its depiction of Travers, but very vanilla in its depiction of Walt. Giamatti as the fictional limo driver had more depth and complexity.

The movie is most valuable as a character piece. It tries to say some big things about how people live through sorrow, like Travers' childhood, and survive that sorrow by creating art about it, like ""Mary Poppins."" That big idea really didn't wash for me. I know it's possibly true, but that message just didn't grab me, so the movie was not a ten, but it's certainly worth viewing for Thompson's performance, for her interplay with Giamatti and the Sherman brothers as played by Schwartzman and Novak.",1390003200,56,3853,4.7388059701492535

The situations dealt with in a little girls life, how she hid her feelings till she had to face them for real,including all of the dark shadows of her past. This was a real struggle for her. I rated this movie 5 stars because it is worthy of it. Tom Hanks was his usual self excellent. I know that should you buy this movie you will not be disappointed .

5608541,5,B00BEIYSL4,"John Lee Hancock (The Blindside, The Rookie) directed this wonderful film that gives a much curious insight into what became one of Walt Disneys most popular and beloved movies ever, Mary Poppins. With a wonderful script by Kelly Marcel (Fifty Shades of Grey, Terra Nova) and Sue Smith (Peaches, The Cooks), Saving Mr. Banks is a film about a film that almost didn't get made.

Its hard to believe the author herself P.L. Travers, wanted nothing to do with Hollywood, the entertainment industry overall and especially Walt Disney who ironically enough did not give her blessing, begrudgingly, for over 20 years. Headlining the Travers herself is the tour-de-force performance of Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Primary Colors) as the old-fashioned, somewhat bitter author who really was a real thorn in Walts side as well as the Sherman Brothers as they tried and tried composed the music for the original film much to her dismay.

Tom Hanks (Big, Splash) gives an equally amazing performance as the man everyone knows, but knows very little about in terms of his personal style and personality traits. Turns out that Tom is amazing at getting across Disneys convictions, warmth, true heart and the simplicity of fulfilling a promise to his daughters of making a movie called Mary Poppins based on Travers books. Again, he shines in his persona and makes it very easy to believe the man who warms the hearts of millions can even have problems sometimes warming the heart of just one person.

Tom and Emma have such a great on-screen chemistry together and the constant infusion of P.L.s ideas and concepts while tearing apart the project overall were a great contrast to Disney ever trying so hard to get to know her and figure her out and why she is so bitter. The movie has a really slow pace for the first 45 minutes or so, but then picks up as Emma shines as the feistiest and irritable English woman you will ever see on screen.

The Sherman Brothers, the men who created the music for much of the award-winning Disney library are the ones who had the most difficult time working with P.L. as she was more than mean, cross and downright rude and the roles were poignantly cast by B.J. Novak (The Internship, The Office) as Robert Sherman and Jason Swartzman (Bored To Death, Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) as Richard Sherman. They have some amazing scenes with Emma that will definitely make you raise an eyebrow and feel for the brothers anguish.

Another surprise in the film is Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Turbo) who gives a wonderful performance as the driver assigned to take P.L. wherever she needs to go in Los Angeles while Disney tries to swoon her for the rights to do her book on film. Paul is subtle and sensitive and amazingly heartwarming in his performance and youll actually cheer for him by the end.

This movie is written in a visual style that intertwines P.L. Travers real life from her past intermixed with the current time of Disney and Travers trying to make a deal for her book. We get to see her as a young girl and her most important influence in her life, her father, who is wonderfully played by Collin Farrell (Phone Booth, Total Recall). At first it was a little strange, but as you see how everything ties together, cutting back and forth - it eventually makes much more sense.

Thomas Newman ( Wall*E, Skyfall) adds his wonderful score to a really powerfully performed movie. This film will definitely warm your heart by the end. And, even with its Hollywood sprinkles of glamour throughout, Saving Mr. Banks portrays very real people and real feelings. Its amazing what Disney had to go through to get Mary Poppins made. I give kudos to every performance in this film and a good insight to the creation of a legend. Dont miss this one.",1389312000,11,3765,4.7214611872146115
5608542,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is the kind of film that Hollywood ought to love. It's about how one of the most beloved movies in movie history got made. And it's the first time Walt Disney has ever been portrayed in a movie, so that's saying a lot. And, just to put all of this perspective, when Disney first heard that the movie was being made, they're first reaction was to buy it and squash it. See, there's a reason Walt has never been portrayed onscreen before. However, after looking at it, they decided not only not to do that but to produce it! It's that kind of movie.

And it's good. I mean, it's really good. I know it is because my wife cried through about the last third of it. I will be extremely surprised if it doesn't get the best picture Oscar this year. Overall, from what we've seen so far, I think it's most well rounded show out there. And it leaves you feeling good after having had a good cry.

Not to get into what the movie is about, but it's about how Walt Disney convinced P. L. Travers to give him the rights to make Mary Poppins, something it took him 20 years to do. Along with that story, you see the story of the defining moment of Travers' childhood, which shows why Poppins was so important to her. From what I've seen from fact-checking, the movie is fairly accurate, which is another plus. A big one, actually. They did have hours and hours of audio recordings from sessions with Travers and some of the people working on the movie (because she insisted that everything be recorded), so they wouldn't have had a good excuse for it not being accurate.

So, first, let's talk Tom Hanks. Oh, man, Tom Hanks was... incredible. There were moments, especially when they showed him watching himself on the old black and white TV show Walt introduced, where he was just like Disney. And, from everything I've read, Hanks did capture Walt to an amazing extent. I do know that the folks at Disney Studios shaved Hanks' mustache to the exact dimensions that Walt wore his. His only being called a supporting actor for this role, but I think it's a safe bet that he will at least get a nomination for it. I will not at all be surprised if he wins. Actually, I hope he does. [I haven't seen Captain Phillips, yet, but he's also being talked about for a best actor nomination for that one.]

Then, we have to talk Emma Thompson, and she may just deserve best actress for her performance. That's a tough call for me, though, because Sandra Bullock carried an entire movie virtually by herself, and that's an impressive feat. However, I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off Travers the way Thompson did. It was a great performance, and she and Hanks were perfect together.

Paul Giamatti was lovable as Ralph, the chauffeur. This role probably wasn't especially difficult for Giamatti, but he was perfect in it. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak were awesome as Richard and Robert Sherman. Not the parts called for too much, but it was great to see them in the movie. They were good, too. Especially this one part with Novak, but I don't want to spoil it, so you'll just have to see it; then, I'll tell you which one.

Which brings us to Colin Farrell. Farrell is one of those underrated actors who is almost always excellent despite the horrible movies he's in. I mean, Alexander wasn't really his fault, and how can you blame him for not turning down Total Recall? At any rate, he's wonderful and wonderfully tragic as Travers Goff. He was my favorite part of the movie. I mentioned that my wife cried, but there were some scenes of Goff with his daughter where I almost cried. That's kind of saying a lot for me.

I loved this movie. Of the possible best picture nominees, if you have to pick just one, this is the one I would recommend. Sure, Gravity is visually amazing, but this movie has heart that Gravity just doesn't have, no matter how you feel about Walt Disney. And let me make this clear, the movie is not about Walt Disney; the script was written (and not changed) before Disney (the Company) had a hand in it; the movie is about Travers and how she was ultimately convinced to allow Walt to make Mary Poppins into a movie. It's definitely worth seeing.",1389225600,168,4184,4.454308093994778

Her artistic successes seem to have come in spite of a surly and cantankerous personality.  Those who put up with her probably merited some consideration for canonization (Caution: We are hearing Walt's side of things!)!

5608546,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely film. A jolly holiday, you might say. If you haven't heard the buzz on this film, it concerns the back story of how Walt Disney took years (well, decades actually) to convince P.L. Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins books to let Disney have the rights to make the Mary Poppins film.

Tom Hanks looks like he is having a wonderful time portraying the larger than life Walt Disney. Emma Thompson seems to be channeling every old crusty aunt she ever encountered as a child to bring the difficult and very odd authoress to the screen. Again, she appears to be having a ball.

Colin Farrell plays the lovable but unreliable father of Mrs. Travers in the flashback scenes of her childhood in Australia. Apparently after her father died, young Helen Lyndon Goff reinvented herself as Pamela Lyndon Travers and traveled to England to write after a failed stage career in Australia. The Disney version of the story is quite whitewashed, although you might not think so while watching the film. Travers was apparently a bisexual single mother who adopted only one of a set of twins after consulting with an astrologer about which boy to choose.

And if you think Emma Thompson is portraying Travers in a harsh light, stay behind in the theatre for the end of the credits, where they play some of the audio tapes of the meetings between the author and the film makers. She was a real piece of work!

Thankfully, the Mary Poppins film that we know and love so well was made by Walt Disney as it is perfection in my estimation. Well, perhaps it is a tad too long, which is also the case with Saving Mr. Banks but they are equally wonderful.

Things than many Disney fans may not know about this brilliant man unless they have read all the many books that have been written about him.

Saving Mr. Banks is practically perfect in every way. While we all share common moments like the Kennedy assasanation or the collapse of the twin towers, it is very rare that society shares a completely joyous memory. Almost all of us have seen Mary Poppins and remember it fondly. This common ground is what makes this delightful film such a powerful experience.

Mr. Bandks tells the story of how Walt Disney convinced a tetchy Englishwoman to option the rights to her children's books about the fairy-tale nanny, Mary Poppins.

The film has a dazzling script, showing the characters' complexity and growth. Emma Thompson and Collin Ferrill give extremely convincing performances. Overall, the movie is exceptionally well made. There is exceptionally beautiful chemistry between P.L. Travers and the limo driver. Paul Giamatti does a fantastic job in this small role.

The whole movie is brilliantly done and tells a very complex story that goes to some very dark and disturbing places despite the cheerful topic. The writing is wonderful, and the casting is perfection. Thomson plays Travers as a difficult person in a way that makes us understand her.

HINT: Make sure you watch through to the end of the credits.

Ms. Travers has daddy issues which manifest itself in the character of Mr. Banks. While she is giving the Disney production team a hard time, she relives moments from her childhood which makes it difficult for her to let go of Mary, the only family she has left.

5608581,5,B00BEIYSL4,"I knew little about the film other than the fact that it starred Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks and revolved around the making of the Disney movie ""Mary Poppins""; however the star power of those two great actors was enough to convince me to give it a try. P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is a stern middle aged British matron who has refused for 20 years to sign over the movie rights to Disney Studios; but when she is in financial need and in danger of losing her home, finally relents to at least visit Hollywood and see what Disney has in mind for her beloved book.

Travers abhors everything about the Disney empire, and gets off to a bad start when she finds her room at the Beverly Hills Hotel stuffed with Disney toys and characters. Her driver during her stay is Paul Giamatti, and the relationship that she develops with him, starting with rudeness and ending up with fondness, is entertaining to watch. When she arrives at the studio to meet Walt Disney she makes it very clear that if they do not adhere to her restrictions for the screenplay, she will not sign the contract. She is a stern taskmaster with the entire staff, and the Sherman Brothers, who have been hired to write the songs for the movie, work hard to please her.

Though I found her a bit tiresome at times, apparently the portrayal of Ms. Travers was accurate, as the proceedings were recorded on audio tape at her insistence. (Snippets from those tapes were played during the credits.) Mary Poppins is a part of Ms. Travers' family and upbringing, and she can't bear to see her story altered or trivialized in any way. Through flashbacks of Ms. Travers' childhood with her beloved father (acted beautifully by Colin Farrell), we come to understand why the fictional character is so important to her. The narrative is seamlessly woven between the current day and Ms. Travers' childhood, and builds up to an emotional climax.

Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney as a fatherly and caring, though somewhat manipulative, businessman. Of course, we all know that he eventually got his way; but the way he finally won her over was lovely and inspiring to watch. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is interesting from a historical perspective, humorous and emotional with excellent casting decisions throughout.",1388102400,4,2255,4.747448979591836

5608584,3,B00BEIYSL4,"This is a highly fictionalized, but in some details quite accurate, movie about the attempt by Walt Disney to get Mary Poppins made, and the journey from stubbornness to openness by the author, Pamela Travers.  I had high hopes of Tom Hanks's performance as Walt Disney.  Man, he nails accents really well!  He can do Forrest Gump, Captain Phillips, and most impressively of all to me, Viktor Navorski on The Terminal.  And he didn't let me down as Walt Disney, mastering the rhythm and inflection of Disney.  I think he's one of the most versatile actors around today.  I was not familiar with Emma Thompson, but given the fact that the script caricatured her as someone who is unkind to everybody she meets and prissy to the utmost extreme, she gave the character sensitivity and humanity.

The movie trailer made it look more like a comedy, but it actually is more of a drama.  Like many movies nowadays, it relies heavily on flashbacks, and they can be distracting, but I got used to 'em and saw how they ran concurrently with Travers's emotional journey.  I think as a movie, it works/is effective to structure the story around Travers opening up to Walt Disney's imagination and zest for life, in the context of Travers's painful childhood.  But since the character Travers is caricatured to the extent she is, I think it is unfair to her (though she is dead) to present such a one-sided story, as if her fussiness about every detail of the Mary Poppins movie was directly the fault of her unhappy childhood, which the movie overly insinuates.

It felt like an oversimplification to me of the historical truth when she was portrayed as a sullen woman who was stand-offish to EVERYONE, while Walt Disney was the warm, jolly good guy.  Walt was a master showman, and a decisive businessman, but I have a hunch he wasn't nearly as warm toward her, who was constantly nitpicking about details, as the movie makes it seem.  But Tom Hanks mastered what the script gave him, and so did Emma Thompson.  And it's not a bad script, but it is not as historically accurate as it purports to be, and I think that's not very fair to Travers.  Her obsession with creative control is common, not confined to people who have bitter childhoods, and I think if they hadn't caricatured her so much with fictionalized incidents like fussing at a flight attendant (twice!) and making her so neurotic about anything bright and sunny, it would have been a better movie.  I hate the movie Amadeus because of its portrayal of Mozart as a totally obnoxious man, which even before I read about its inaccuracies I knew was oversimplistic.  You can capture the qualities of a character in a movie role but miss the essence, and I think that in this case, the essence of the very complex Travers and Disney was missing, even though personality traits were captured.  But unlike Amadeus, I enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks as a movie, even if not in a historical way.  The real Travers's main cause for being so shrewish at the Disney studio was a different creative vision.  She wanted a film with serious themes based in the Great Depression and her own rough childhood.  I've read that her Mary Poppins books are much more serious in tone than Disney's colorful and optimistic movie.  She figured that as the creator, she could dictate every detail.

Summary:  Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are both outstanding, and I could go on with praise for the actors for the Sherman Brothers and some other characters.  As far as historical accuracy goes, it is hagiographic (depicting as saintly) of Walt, who wasn't that warm towards Travers, and oversimplifies Travers as a shrewish woman when her main cause for being so on the Mary Poppins movie collaboration was a different creative vision.  It's a fun movie in ways, though.  It has very good cinematography that keeps it really engaging, and it's fun watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney.",1387929600,6,3902,4.725258493353028
5608585,5,B00BEIYSL4,"This IS, quite simply, an extraordinary movie!!

How many movies have you attend where the audience APPLAUDED during the credits???

I've attended many Broadway plays/musicals that ended in a standing applause but NEVER a movie. The showing I just got back from ended with applause with about 50% of the attendees standing!!

The only reason I would not rate this a absolutely perfect movie is not being sure how much of this movie is fact and how much is Hollywood make believe. The story is so well done, especially the 'flashbacks', that I'm almost stunned into silence.

LOL - which is extremely rare for me.

I, too, had a paper route from about 8 to 13 - football, etc made me give it up to my sister who passed it on to my two youngest brothers - altogether we had the same route for more than 15 years. In fact I delivered the paper with a very heavy heart the day after Walt Disney died.

My father didn't drink but for various reasons was just barely involved in my life. He worked the 2nd shift never getting home until 1:45 or 2:00 AM. He then worked on almost every Saturday from noon until 5:30. Thus I almost never saw him other than Sundays.

This movie has heart and will appeal to nearly anyone I can imagine. Losing a parent is always hard even if it's one you were not close to. In fact that may make it harder (this happened to me - I always thought I would have time to get closer and know my dad better but I didn't) - maybe not harder than losing one you are close to when you very young but still very hard.

I know that I (and most of the audience) will now search out information on both Walt Disney and P.L. Travers.

Playing a small snippet of the tapes made during the actual production was a really nice touch. It is my hope they will release more of them when this is released on Blu-ray and DVD. I know that I would pay to read or listen to them as I think they would be very intriguing.

I feel very confident that this movie, and probably both Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, will, at the very least, be nominated for academy awards!

This is a rare and moving film - I would rate this a 9.75 to 10.0 - I urge all of you to attend if at all possible!!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!

5608586,3,B00BEIYSL4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Walt Disney had been trying to obtain the rights to make 'Mary Poppins' into a film for years, but P.L. Travers, its highly critical author, wouldn't budge. Finally in 1961, faced with diminishing financial assets, Travers agreed to Disney's proposal with the proviso that she have the last say in regards to creative control of the script.

In 'Saving Mr. Banks', Travers is depicted as the film's 'heavy' and Disney as the understanding 'good guy'. In reality, Travers was a much more complicated person than the stereotyped martinet who puts the Disney creative team through a living hell. The film's scenarists posit a simplistic scenario in which Travers' difficult childhood is the reason she grows up to be such a sourpuss. A good part of the film features flashbacks to Travers' early childhood in Queensland, Australia, where her highly imaginative father (well-played by Colin Farrell) encourages the young Travers' creativity but cannot control his own, very sad addiction to alcohol.

The childhood flashbacks prove to be a ponderous affair and could have been easily done in one or two short but compact, all-encompassing scenes. Perhaps it would have been better to show Travers' life as she progressed into adulthood. Hardly someone who was narrow-minded (as some might get the impression here), Travers had a career as an actress and poet in her younger days, had a number of bisexual lovers, adopted a child when she was 40, spent two summers on different Native American reservations and was an astute student of the mystic, George Gurdjieff.

Disney, on the other hand, is depicted as an eccentric uncle type that everyone loved. Tom Hanks ably conveys the 'good' side of Disney but visually fails to convey his true craggy look--a visage worn down by years of smoking cigarettes (Disney would never allow himself to be shown smoking in public and this fact is actually alluded to in 'Saving Mr. Banks'). Perhaps we needed a few flashbacks also for Mr. Disney, whose dark side included flirtations during the 40s with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an anti- semitic, anti-communist organization (he distanced himself from the organization in the 50s) as well as testifying before the House of Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC), also in the 40s, against a number of liberal Hollywood writers, some of whom ended up being blacklisted (something that Mr. Hanks probably would have been appalled by me, had he been living as an adult, back then).

Nonetheless, it is true that while working on the film version of Mary Poppins, Travers (in some measure), was devoted to playing the part of a curmudgeon. Travers stipulated that the creative sessions between her and the writing team be recorded on tape; thus a good deal of the hilarious interchanges, are utilized by the films' scenarists to illustrate just how far Ms. Travers would go in preserving the integrity of her intellectual property. Sometimes her demands were off the wall like not allowing the color 'red' to be used anywhere in the film. But not everything she objected to was unreasonable. Take for example, her violent distaste for the use of animation in the film. That, actually, constitutes the 'dark moment' at the end of Act II, when Travers bolts Disney headquarters (with unsigned contract in tow) and returns to England, vowing never to see Mary Poppins completed as a movie, precisely because of Walt Disney's desire to insert a small sequence involving dancing Penguins (Having seen clips of those dancing penguins, I can completely understand why Ms. Travers was upset!).

The rest of the plot involves how Disney and company (along with the help of Travers' chauffeur, played by the always interesting Paul Giamatti) managed to soften Travers up and convince her to give up her rights, so that 'Mary Poppins' could finally get made.. Here, 'good' Disney shines; I don't know whether this actually happened, but Disney expresses empathy for Travers, when he recalls how he was very protective of his own invention, Mickey Mouse, when others were out to change his concept. I do know Disney did not fly all the way to England to convince Travers to change her mind, but Hanks gives his most impassioned speech of the movie when he links the history of his own creative career to that of Travers, during their face off in the UK.

The Disney creative team also becomes more 'sensitive' to Travers' desire to ensure that her father's legacy is not tarnished. Hence, they 'save' Mr. Banks by not making him a 'pathetic' character (a drunkard in real life) but one who loves children and always wants to help them (he fixes the kite and the Sherman Brothers, end up penning the enormously catchy, 'Let's Go Fly a Kite."")

The scenarists revert to comedy when Travers invites herself to the Mary Poppins Hollywood premiere after Disney declines to issue an invitation (Disney's fear is that she'll muck things up at the premiere, acting as a loose cannon). While Travers is watching the animated penguin sequence, you can see tears streaming down her cheeks. Disney leans over, and says something to her, to the effect that the animation didn't turn out to be so bad after all; but Travers explains she's crying because she still finds the animation repulsive.

'Saving Mr. Banks' is an affectionate look at a small piece of entertainment history. It pulls at the heart strings but one still must look at it with a jaded eye. It's a film that was vetted beforehand by the Disney Corporation, who were bent on protecting their founder's reputation at any cost. The result is a slight loss of prestige for P.L. Travers. Nonetheless, she was the one who got the last laugh, by barring any future film sequels and insisting on only British writers working on a Mary Poppins musical.",1387843200,5,5852,4.945066124109868

5608589,4,B00BEIYSL4,"When nominations were being made for the 2014 Golden Globes, I read that if Saving Mr. Banks were to get a nomination, it would have been in the drama category.  That sounded odd.  I mean Tom Hanks as Walt Disney trying to get the author of Mary Poppins to sign over movie rights, a drama?  Now, the Golden Globes don't always get it right  its kind of their thing, but regarding Saving Mr. Banks as a drama  they were right about this one.

It may seem a bit self-indulgent for a movie studio to make a movie about how amazing they were when they made another movie, but theres more to this story than just that.  Primarily, Saving Mr. Banks is the behind the scenes story of Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) furiously courting writer P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) in the hopes of getting her to sign over the movie rights to her Mary Poppins childrens books. Hanks summons all of the likability of well, Tom Hanks, to portray the larger than life filmmaker.  His motive is to fulfill a promise to his daughters 20 years in the making, that he would produce a film about their favorite childhood books.  Travers is the holdout as she has seen Disneys films over the past 20 years and does not want her beloved characters to be romping around stage, singing, and worst of allas cartoons!  In 1961, Disney finally convinces Travers to at least visit Los Angeles, sit in with the writers, and see what happens.

Travers is a terror on Disney, his writers, and his staff.  Her arrogant British ways are on full display, but it is clear that she has high defenses for a reason; these characters are important to her for reasons Disney can not possibly understand.  Director, John Lee Hancock explores the layers of Travers through flashback, sporadically inserting scenes of her childhood with her parents Travers (Colin Farrell) and Margaret (Ruth Wilson).  Through these flashbacks, the audience gets a rueful sense of Poppins origin.  Hancock and his editors are brilliant at sensing when these scenes are necessary.  This is especially evident in a fine scene set to the Mary Poppins song, Feed the Birds.

Cleary, Mary Poppins becomes a film and a film beloved by generations of people for 50 years now, so whether the film is made is not a source of tension whatsoever.  The strength of the film is in its way that Travers and Disney slowly are able to find common ground.  Doubtless, we are seeing some revisionist history.  Im sure that if another studio had been granted the rights to tell this story, we might get a different vision of Walt Disney, the man.  However, Saving Mr. Banks does not seek to disparage its characters.  Rather, it desires to explore some of the magic that makes characters and stories meaningful to us.  The film is actually quite clever in its construction as it subtly mirrors the conflict in Mary Poppins through Traverss fear of what blind capitalism might do to something she sees as so precious and pure.

Disney fans will also find much to enjoy as the nostalgia level is through the roof and hypnotizing.  Memorable songs from Mary Poppins are strewn all over the film, and it is very enjoyable to watch these songs develop and be performed all over again.  In one scene, as Paul Giamattis character, Ralph, drives Travers into Walt Disney Land for the first time, he may as well come back and pick us up too!  In fact, during the credits photos of Walt Disney and all of the characters from the film are displayed and a real audio sample of the real P.L. Travers bossing around the writers can be heard.  The film is laced with Disney, but the contact high is pleasant.

Thompson is irrepressibly repressive as Travers.  It is a delight to see her take the lead again for the first time since reprising her role as Nanny McPhee in 2010; however, this is her finest and most substantial performance in many years.  By the end of the film, she has the audience in the palm of her hand and conveniently one of the films final scenes takes place in a movie theater where the audience has no choice but to fully experience and empathize with her literally from per point of view.  Hanks does an ample and sufficient job as Disney, but most of his scenes involve making puzzled looks or smiling a lot.  There are several times throughout the film where viewers will ask themselves, how is he ever going to get this woman to sign over the rights? and he succeeds in making us understand, chiefly thanks to one fine speech towards the films end.  Otherwise, Hanks is a recognizable caricature.  It is certainly P.L. Traverss story, but it would have been nice to get a bit more into Disneys head than this film had intended.

Saving Mr. Banks is a surprisingly rich contextual film, appropriately layered to tell not one but two deeply related stories.  I was surprised how caught up I found myself with the flashback scenes and consequently with how much I liked this film.  A-

5608590,4,B00BEIYSL4,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Just in time for the 50th Anniversary Blu ray edition of ""Mary Poppins,"" the Disney folks coincidentally (sure) release this film.  Rather than dig deep into the background of making the film itself, director John Lee Hancock and his writers (Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith) delve into the brusk relationship between the crusty author of the ""Poppins"" books, P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks).

The film spends an equal amount of time in the present (early 1960's) and 1910 Australia where Travers grew up as Ginty (Annie Rose Buckley), the oldest daughter of banker Travers Goff (an unheralded Colin Farrell).  As the film flits between the time periods we learn why Mrs. Travers insists the film have a serious tone and certainly ""no animation!""  Goff and Ginty had a great relationship but he was also a card carrying alcoholic who had been fired from his job in the city and could only find work in a remote town on the continent.

In the film ""Mary Poppins,"" Mr. Banks is the grouchy father who is a bank officer in London.  Thompson is brilliant as Pam, as Walt insisted on calling her.  She makes her character terribly unlikable, but a perfect challenge for Disney who was used to getting his way.  Mrs. Travers was reluctant to give up the film rights unless she had control over the story line.  The ever insistent Walt had made a promise to his daughters that he would make a film based on the books and pursued Mrs. Travers for 20 years.

The best scenes are in the final act as Travers begins to soften, yet still refuses and returns to England.  Walt pursues her, showing up at her door unannounced.  As he always does Hanks manages to capture the whole movie in a 5 minute scene as he finally persuades Mrs. Travers to sign the contract.  This isn't a perfect film to be sure.  It runs a bit long and omits any interaction between Mrs. Travers and the actors who would play her characters.  And some of the time period switches can be a bit haphazard.  Still it has moments of strong emotion, an appropriate amount of humor and some strong performances.",1387756800,,2132,4.625
5608591,5,B00BEIYSL4,"If you want to be an Oscar contender release your movie in December.

I wonder do they have secret meetings in Hollywood about what types of movies to make if one wants to win an Academy Award, because we have seen a plethora of movies about movies and movie making in recent years, which seem to do quite well during award season.  The most successful one being The Artist which won numerous Academy Awards, and several other note worthies too.  I liked My Week with Marilyn which gained two well deserved Oscar nominations for Michelle Williams  and Kenneth Branagh.  I was less wowed with Hitchcock.

Now with Saving Mr Banks we have the latest, and one of the greatest of them all,  and in terms of beautiful and emotional story as good a movie as you will see this year.

For most authors having their book made into a movie would be a dream come true.

Emma Thompson gives an outstanding performance as P.L Travers the author of Mary Poppins who is reluctant to say the least about having her story made into a movie, let alone a musical, and the battles with the creative team at Disney to get it made.

If you're like me Travers is a pill, with the apparent social skills of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We see her first by how she interacts with ordinary people such as a flight attendant or a fellow passenger, and she seems entirely oblivious to how other people feel.  On some level we are horrified but yet it is in some ways amusing.

Yet she is the driving force of the narrative with even Walt Disney played by Tom Hanks taking a back seat.  It's absolutely brilliant to see the creative forces at work in creating this classic, and as the parallel story of her childhood unfolds as you watch the movie, we gradually come to understand how she became who she is.

She lobs pears from her courtesy fruit basket into the hotel swimming pool, and she does not seem to like people.  How did someone who wrote such a classic and inspiring children's book become like this you may wonder?

Do our childhoods shape who we are?  Unless we learn how to let go, and in some cases re-imagine our childhoods as Disney says those childhood events may very well determine our destiny.

Colin Farrell plays her father as a child, at once inspiring her imagination and love, yet also falling short, and the elements of Mary Poppins and her personal story start to mesh together wonderfully.

Ultimately there is some catharsis.  Walt Disney had a tough childhood and became ultra successful.  Travers wrote a classic book stemming from her personal story and fashioned a classic.  She believed in sharing the darkness.  Many fairy tale stories are quite dark, often depicting the wickedness in human nature, knowing about wicked people and monsters is somehow better and more instructive than not knowing.

Within the movie are some emotionally affecting scenes, and I know I was not alone in sniffling.  Not many movies have that kind of effect, so I loved that.

At the end of the movie we may not come to love her, but if you can spare one liquid tear, you may come to like her.

I think most people will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",1387670400,5,3147,4.522123893805309
5608592,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Like most people, I honestly couldn't tell you who created Mary Poppins and if you had asked me a month ago if I had ever heard of P.L. Travers, I would have been completely dumbfounded by the name. However, now that BBC Films has teamed with Walt Disney Pictures to produce the new biopic, Saving Mr. Banks, its relatively safe to say a whole new generation of moviegoers will know exactly who Mrs. Travers is and how she came up with one of the most iconic characters ever conceived.

Directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side), Saving Mr. Banks stars Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the English author of the popular children's book, Mary Poppins. On a yearly basis, Mrs. Travers is contacted by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) in regards to making Mary Poppins into a film. However, she is reluctant to work with him and is desperately afraid he will turn her beloved character into another one of his happy-go-lucky cartoons. For years, Disney has hounded her to sign over her consent to create a Mary Poppins film, but she considers the character to be family  and as it turns out, the Mary Poppins story has more to do with Travers' own family than anyone knows.

At the same time, the royalty checks have stopped coming in for the original Mary Poppins book, and since Mrs. Travers refuses to write another novel, it has put her in a financial pinch. Her lawyer indicates that it's in her best interest to go to California and work out her creative differences with Walt Disney in order to get the feature film off the ground. Once there, and with creative control on her side, she must work out her differences with the creative team, including Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), and the Sherman brothers, Robert (B.J. Novak) and Richard (Jason Schwartzman).

While focusing on developing the script and songs for the Mary Poppins film, Saving Mr. Banks also tells a parallel story that intertwines with Mrs. Travers during her time with the creative staff. She focuses heavily on her early childhood while living with her family in Australia, especially the time she spent with her father, Travers Robert Goff (Colin Farrell). He was a loving father, attempting to support his family by working at a bank, just as Mr. Banks did in Mary Poppins. The difference is her father was not a wealthy aristocrat as portrayed in the story. Instead, he was a conflicted individual that was unable to control his anger or his ambition to consume alcohol.

Clearly, Mrs. Travers was a difficult woman to deal with in nearly every aspect of life  which is well presented by the flawless performance of Academy Award winning Emma Thompson. If you've never seen or heard an interview with the late Mrs. Travers, then believe me when I say that Thompson's interpretation is far nicer than the presentation in this family-friendly film. This aspect makes Thompson's performance all that much more impressive, because it's hard to imagine very many people liking Mrs. Travers, yet at no point in this film is she vilified. In fact, with the constant flashbacks to her childhood, she becomes a largely sympathetic character that you can't help feel compassion for. It also doesn't hurt that Emma Thompson herself is an absolute marvel to witness, not just in this film but over the course of her momentous career.

The film focuses heavily on Thompson's portrayal as the strict, borderline snobby (or proper, depending how you look at it) Mrs. Travers  but the supporting cast also deserves a massive amount of credit for their roles. In particular, Tom Hanks role as the determined, but not overly pushy Walt Disney is the most notable  and is quite nostalgic if you're able to remember back to those classic shots of Walt Disney during the 1960s and 70s. Oddly enough, it's the trademark mustache on Hanks that really brings out the slight resemblance to Mr. Disney  who has never been portrayed in modern media until now. On a side note, even though Mr. Disney was a heavy smoker back in the day, you won't be seeing Hanks holding a cigarette (except for one brief scene). Apparently, that's an unforgivable offense in a Disney film.

Recognizable actors Paul Giamatti and Bradley Whitiford also contribute heavily to this film in their minor supporting roles. Obviously, it seems like Giamatti is everywhere these days, having roles in Turbo, Parkland, 12 Years a Slave, and All is Bright in 2013 alone. You're almost forced to wonder if the man ever sleeps. His co-star, Bradley Whitiford, is probably most recognizable from his starring role in NBC's The West Wing or as Adam Sandler's foe in Billy Madison. Whitiford does a fair share of singing and dancing in this film, portraying Don DaGradi who, along with Bill Walsh, wrote the screenplay for the Mary Poppins film.

While this is one of the better biopics in the last few years, there are few elaborations that stick out in Saving Mr. Banks. For one, this film implies that Mrs. Travers had a massive amount of input throughout the duration of the pre-development of Mary Poppins. In reality, she was overruled by Disney on several aspect, including the inclusion of the animated portions  of which she demanded Disney remove after the initial premiere. After signing over her rights, she had very little to do with the final product. In fact, Mrs. Travers detested the Mary Poppins film so much that she refused to let Disney adapt any of her future Poppins stories (she would go on to create seven more successful Mary Poppins novels).

Lastly, for a film that focuses so much on Mrs. Travers' family, it's a bit surprising to see that her son, Camillus, is never mentioned (although briefly alluded to). Her son was adopted, which is something she neglected to tell him until he found out on his own  leaving a dark cloud over several years in both of their lives. Of course, there is quite a bit of negativity surrounding this aspect of her life, so it might have been far too much to include in a Disney produced film that typically loves to send everyone home happy.

Overall, Saving Mr. Banks is without a doubt the best biopic of 2013 and also a formidable contender for the best picture of the year (regardless of its future accolades). Both Emma Thomson and Tom Hanks are magnificent in their respective roles, radiating with magic and authenticity. Both of their portrayals are full of heart, history, and loyalty to their beloved characters. Although Mrs. Travers was clearly a forced to be reckoned with, her desire to protect her beloved Mary Poppins is quite an astonishing story. She may not have enjoyed the end result of the 1964 classic, which went on to propel Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke to new heights, but she did reap the reward of its $100 million box office earning (of which she received 5%). Regardless, Saving Mr. Banks is a feel-good film that should be witnessed by all.

5608593,5,B00BEIYSL4,"The creative clash of a powerful Hollywood producer and a best-selling author over the making of a movie would appear to be thin material for a holiday movie.  In the capable hands of the Walt Disney Company and a host of excellent actors, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an unexpected pleasure, funny and emotionally engaging in a powerful way.

The movie opens in 1961.  P.L. Travers, author of the ""Mary Poppins"" series of books, has been persuaded to fly to California to discuss the making of a movie with Walt Disney himself.  Travers (Emma Thompson) is very much invested in protecting her character from Hollywood exploitation, just about as much as Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) wants to make a movie out of the story.  Travers makes life very difficult for Disney's creative team and Walt himself.

Paralleling Travers' adventures in America is the story of her upbringing, half a century earlier, in rural Australia, a slow-motion tragedy that is the deep backstory to her ""Mary Poppins"" characters.  Devotion to her memories of that childhood are a stumbling block to the creative process in the present.  Walt Disney will be driven to great lengths to meet her more than halfway, culminating in a fateful conversation over tea back in London and a promise to respect her memories, even if it means remaking them a little.

The acting in this movie is special.  Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are terrific together.  Colin Ferrell is heartbreaking as Travers' father, the inspiration for Mr. Banks.  Paul Giamatti is superb as Travers' limo driver in California, the one person who doesn't have an agenda.  A dozen other actors, including Kathy Bates and Ruth Wilson, have well-rounded supporting roles. Annie Rose Buckley almost steals the movie as the solemn young Travers.

This movie is a ""talky"", with no action to speak of.  The sets, whether 1961 or 1906, are convincing.  The humor is often subtle but quite good.  The dramatization carries real emotional impact.  The movie will make more sense if the viewer has seen the classic movie ""Mary Poppins"".  Highly recommended.",1387584000,25,2074,4.959420289855072
5608594,5,B00BEIYSL4,"Saving Mr. Banks is a film that carefully centers around Walt Disneys initial challenge in convincing the author of Mary Poppins (Pamela Travers) to hand over the concept of what Mary Poppins stands for. The movie includes scenes that flash back to how her viewpoints were shaped during her childhood years in Australia and the relationship with her parents. Each of the actors and actresses  contributed to the shaping of the movies depiction that captured Walt Disneys interactions with Pamela Travers (Both Colin Farrell and Paul Giamatti are also featured in Saving Mr. Banks). However, I admit that I enjoyed watching Emma Thompsons gifted portrayal of a woman who initially seems snobbish when it comes to her interactions with both Disney and the other cast members. However, Emma Thompson carefully puts forth great intensity (through her emotions) in helping the viewing audience understand the root reasons behind her distant nature.  I also enjoyed Tom Hanks favorable impression of Disney because he used his acting skills to portray a man who tactfully found a way to help the author understand why she had reservations in sharing the book. It was also heartfelt that Hanks played a character who cared very much about keeping a past promise to his children.  Both Walt Disney and the workers initially get the cold treatment by Pamela Travers. Obviously, I must refrain from sharing more to keep in mind other film goers who have yet to see Saving Mr. Banks.",1387584000,,1472,5.024590163934426
5608595,4,B00BEIYSL4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" (2013 release; 120 min.) brings the real-life story of how Walt Disney tried to convince PL Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins books, to let Disney Studio adopt it into a family-oriented, feel-good musical. As the movie opens, we are in Maryborough, Queensland (Aus) in 1906, where we get to know young Helen (nicknamed Ginty), her troubled (and alcoholic) dad Travers, and the rest of her family. The movie then morphs to London, 1961, where we get to know PL Travers as a difficult and outright grumpy woman, but because she is literally out of money, her agent is able to convince her to go to Los Angeles and meet with Walt and the rest of the Disney team, to see if they can come to terms on the development of the movie. From there the movie cuts back and forth between Australia and the 1960s. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, even though this movie already has a great buzz around it, I was more than pleasantly surprised, and moved. The writers (Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith) did an outstanding job recreating the circumstances of Helen Goff (who later changed her name to PJ Travers). In the first hour of the movie, when we don't really know PJ Travers yet, we wonder why, when her agent implores her to go to Los Angeles, PJ Travers bitterly replies ""you don't know how much she means to me!"" (she being the Mary Poppins creation). Only much later do we get a true sense of it. Second, tip o' the hat to Emma Thompson, who blew me away frankly, and to Tom Hanks, in their roles as PJ Travers and Walt Disney, respectively. Only recently did I see Hanks in ""Captain Phillips"", and this movie now makes two in a row where Hanks brings a winning performance. Looks like he's got his mojo back after a weak string in recent years. Third, kudos to the production team. I couldn't stop marveling at the sets in this movie, which were picture perfect in every detail. Fourth, just to warn you that you may need some Kleenex towards the end of the movie (I know I did). Last but certainly not least, there is an excellent orchestral score to the movie, composed by Thomas Newman (the soundtrack can be found here on Amazon).

""Saving Mr. Banks"" opened yesterday here in Cincinnati, and the late matinee screening I saw this at today was very well attended, I am happy to say. The audience was really into it, laughing loudly at all the right moments. Bottom line: ""Savings Mr. Banks is another top-notch look at a slice of Hollywood from yesterday, not unlike, for example, the ""Hitchcock"" movie from last year starring Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1387497600,5,2741,4.569105691056911
5608596,5,B00BEIYSL4,"As always, no spoilers whatsoever in this review because that's just plain inconsiderate.

Saving Mr. Banks is a dual narrative portrait of the author of Mary Poppins and the creative team at Walt Disney that worked to bring it to the big screen.  In one thread (1961) we have the curmudgeonly author behaving like a stark raving... well, curmudgeon as she tries to exert control over the creative process.  In the other thread (1906, Australia) we unwind the story of her grim childhood that makes her a curmudgeon in the first place.

This movie has a lot of things to say not the least of which is to cast an entirely different light that beloved American classic of childhood.  Mary Poppins ain't quite what you think it's about as a kid (but then what good movie IS what you think it's about when you're a kid).  It's also a powerful demonstration of how our childhood influences us as adults sometimes in ways that we don't quite grasp until we look back on them from a great distance.

It's also interesting to see behind the curtain of the creative process.  Avoiding spoilers, the author's primary objection is that Mary Poppins and the Banks family have become, in truth, her family over the years and sharing that vision and letting someone else have a piece of them is frightfully difficult.  It does make a person wonder if all authors have this same struggle when crossing mediums.

Lastly, I'm a sucker for sentiment but this movie had the audience blowing its nose and audibly sniffing for a good hour.  It's an incredibly intimate portrait.  However, the kids won't think much of it and the group in the theatre with me was 50+ for the most part.  All that said, highly recommended for anyone with a sentimental streak.  Best movie I've seen in a month or more.

Oh, and the patient who sit through the credits will be treated to some photos from the movie's production and a section of the recorded conversations between the author and the production cast.
