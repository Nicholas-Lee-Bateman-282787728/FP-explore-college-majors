1992482,3,B0001DMY3C,"If you had any basic belly dance class then you already know the moves taught on this video. It seems to be marketed for a younger non-bellydancing audience, which is why I gave my copy to my teenage niece and she and her friends just loved it.

The plus sides is that the instuctions is clear and the quality of the video is superb and the music cd that is included has some nice cuts.",1095465600,24,386,4.1466666666666665
1992483,3,B0001DMY3C,"I found that this video was very basic and mostly aimed at those who are beginners.  If you need a little spice in your Friday night partying, then the line-dance is for you.  I was a little disappointed because I have seen these dancers dance before and they are AWESOME!!!  However, in this video, you would never know.",1095120000,15,321,4.5
1992484,5,B0001DMY3C,"Like the rest of the world, it takes a lot to pull me out of my chair in front of the tv and actually move around.  This DVD is a lot of fun and actually does that.  I'm totally awkward at it, I admit and I can't do half the moves, but that doesn't matter as I'm having a good time and getting my heart beat up.  One night, some friends and I went to a middle eastern restaurant with bellydancing and came back home after and put this on to see if we could get down the moves we'd just seen.  It was a crowd pleaser. I definitely recommend it.",1093046400,11,543,3.864864864864865
1992485,3,B0001DMY3C,"This video is very clearly presented in several easy-to-understand sections. It has a warm-up, step instruction, cool down, a (club modern) dance to learn, improvisational help, performances, interviews, a CD and merchandise. Unfortunatley, it is way to easy for anyone who already knows how to bellydance.

The performances are not stellar, the interviews are with the instructors and their musicians, the dance is not anything amazing - I don't think I'd use it in a club, and there are not many steps to be learned.

This video seems to be aimed at a young, non-bellydancing audience. Sort of the type who have had no actual dance instruction but like to have fun. This DVD would be good for them! But as for serious dancers, and/or those who have experience, I do not recommend this.",1091577600,10,787,4.865671641791045
1992486,5,B0001DMY3C,"I love this bellydance DVD!  This program teaches you some moves and shows you how to put them to use -- on the dance floor.  Bellydance is one of my favorite exercises, and this DVD is a terrific addition to my collection.  The program is easy to watch, to understand and, most importantly, to learn.  It is not too difficult, but you really feel like you have accomplished something.  I also like the bonus music CD that comes w/ the DVD, so you can put to use some of the improvisational skills you learn on the DVD to use while dancing to the CD.",1090108800,5,550,4.25
1992487,4,B0001DMY3C,I am currently deployed in Iraq. I bellydance at home and I was wanted to buy a work out video to keep me going. I didn't know anything about this video and thought that I would just give it a shot to spice up the collection I have that was growing bored. Well my buddy and I did to tonight and we loved it!! They are really great teachers. The way that they describe how to do the moves were clear and gave me new perspective. We had a lot of fun. I gave it four stars because I wanted there to be more on the DVD. I was upset when it was done.  Amar is awsome. She is so good. So this is a very good DVD. I suggest it. And I'm glad that it can spice up my desert living conditions!,1087948800,10,683,3.7762237762237763
1992488,4,B0001DMY3C,"I enjoy this video a lot because it gives you a nice cardio workout while still being low impact. The bellydance moves are easy to follow and, most of the time, build up incrementally. (The undulations and camel walk move a little quickly for me. I think the instruction would have improved with some extra ""exercises"" in those areas.) The music is upbeat and the set is simple without being cheesy or cheap. It took me a while to get used to the accent of the voice-over because it sounded a bit forced but, after five minutes, it didn't bother me any more.
This is a great full-body workout, without being over-taxing. It is fun and the ""BQ Boogie"" is a fun way to end the technique section. The improvisation section helps you incorporate bellydance moves into your every day, clubbin' life. (Which may or may not apply to you but is fun none the less! Hey! Who doesn't like dancing in their living room?!) I really enjoy the extras on the DVD, such as the snippets of BellyQueen around the world and the solo performances by the two instructors. And my 18 month old daughter does too!
A new and innovative way to approach Bellydance instruction!",1085875200,8,1149,4.555555555555555
1992509,5,B0001DMY3C,"This is not a traditional bellydancing video. It has some Hip Hop in it as well such as the ""V Pop."" The music is abrabic with some hip hop beats. I had a lot of fun with this video. I understood the instruction well. I have learned some moves from a book such as the chest slide and the hip lift and drop. From this video, I learned the Omni Circle, Inward Figure eights, half turn step, the shimmy chest circles, hip pop, and the camel. After explaining the moves they put a couple togeather and do a little traveling. It's fun and I like the music. They talk about improvisation and there is a CD with just the music so you can dance to it yourself. I have fun with this DVD and I feel my muscles after this as well. They start off slow and go faster but you can keep to your own pace and grow with it. At the end there is a little dance at the end in a club atmosphere. My mom thought the instruction was good and had fun with this video as well.",1199577600,,950,3.979057591623037
1992510,5,B0001DMY3C,"I own several bellydance DVDs and wish I had purchased this one sooner.  This is an excellent and well paced bellydance workout for beginners.  I can tell they put a lot of thought into what should be included in this DVD.  Bellydance instruction is successfully integrated into the workout.  I am a plus size and I felt comfortable with the pace.  The music alone makes you want to get up groove and it doesn't hurt that they included a separate music CD.  You get a lot for your money with this one:  Instruction, workout, interviews, performances, cccccccd.",1196812800,2,560,4.711340206185567
1992511,3,B0001DMY3C,"Good for learning how to tie steps together if you want to dance on the floor in some nightclub, but that's about it. Watched it once, I'm over it.....and I'm a bellydancer.",1176768000,2,173,4.4375
1992512,4,B0001DMY3C,"This is a fun and easy video that teaches simple moves and an easy-to-follow choreography to pop music.  It is suitable for bellydance beginners and hobbyists.  It is not however a professional choreography or a bellydance training video.  If you buy it for what it is, you'll enjoy the heck out of it.

Amar and Kaeshi are stars of the bellydance world and they certainly know their stuff.  While there are many belly-fitness videos out there, you can't go wrong with these two professionals.

This video has high production values and mine came with an extra CD of contemporary/techno belly dance music.",1168473600,2,605,4.882352941176471
1992513,2,B0001DMY3C,"You do really learn the hip movements easily, and the girls look great with their trendy little outfits, but this IS NOT a workout video!  They teach a small dance routine that's similar to some sort of line dance, where you actually turn after each completion.  This is difficult for beginners, as 3/4 of the time you are turned away from the television.  In addition, as many other views have stated, there is not enough workout content to make this dvd worth my while.  I've had great success with the Island Girl Hula DVD's which teach many similar hip movements at a slow pace while also providing a great workout.",1147132800,7,619,4.6
1992514,5,B0001DMY3C,"Yes, I am more of a beginner, but I love to dance & this is just a very 'fun' way to work off some energy.  I don't believe that it's just for kids either, I'm 47 & have a great time with this dvd.  Granted I wouldn't do any of this on a dance floor, (outside of home),  but, geesh, it's so fun, I can't believe people are taking this so seriously & bashing it. Both ladies dance well, & BOTH are very good on this dvd.  It's FUN!!!!!!!!",1146096000,7,437,3.8764044943820224
1992515,1,B0001DMY3C,"It is ok for KIDS BUT, i think is very VERY EASY to do all the steps, i was expecting something different to challenge myseft with but not the case here, is way too easy and the last two performences that the chinesse do is really bad i am glad that she is not on the BELLY DANCE SUPERSTARS DVD, i mean she is not that good , and AMAR is way better than her her performance is great but the picture of the video was not clear not very good,

and the music also of the workout dvd is bad i didn't like it.

I WILL reconnend this DVD for KIDS that they want to learn something. but not for adult people.

i must say that AMAR IS A GREAT DANCER.!!",1125446400,,644,3.8636363636363638
1992516,5,B0001DMY3C,"Not all bellydance DVDs are workouts, some are just designed to teach the art of dancing with a workout being secondary. Bellyqueen: Bellydance Jam falls into this category. Not purely traditional, the title and front cover of the DVD alone should give away the modern bent on bellydance. This one is designed for the younger generation and or those completely new to bellydance who don't foresee themselves as the next headlining act at the local Mediterranean restaurant but are still interested in learning how to dance better for parties, club, and the like. Bellydancing is the epitome of feminine movement; it's no small wonder that learning some simple bellydance moves with styling tailored for the modern girl is a great way to learn how to club dance. Teaching bellydance moves appropriate for the club floor is the focus of this DVD.

Where this DVD really excels is in the teaching. Amar Gamal of Bellydance Superstars' fame and her Bellyqueen partner Kaeshi Chai, a member of The Desert Roses, are excellent teachers for dancers so young. Moves are all shown full body and if needed, from multiple angles. Instructions are voiceover style and lots of pointers abound on what muscles to relax, what body parts to isolate, and sometimes even when to breathe. All dance descriptions go much further than ""just lift your hip and drop it."" They have one of the best descriptions of the Camel, an undulation move, that is difficult to teach women whose learning style doesn't fall along the lines of `monkey-see, monkey-do.' The clear and concise description of this move as well as several others, a backward moving horizontal figure 8, for example, are clear enough that even an absolute beginner to all forms of dance could eventually get with some practice. If you've had trouble with other DVDs in the past not being clear enough for you to `get' the moves, this is the one for you.

The section on ""How to Improvise"" in the Improvisation section is absolutely priceless for both the newbee and the intermediate dancer. This is a topic rarely covered by instructors in any form of dance. You'll learn how to listen to the music and then choose which moves will appropriately fit the song. The knowledge you'll gain here is transferrable to all forms of dance. In ""Partner Combinations"" Amar and Kaeshi teach you how to dance with a partner in  much more dynamic and interesting ways than the basic routine they provide in the instruction. ""Guided Improvisation"" also gives you the chance to practice.

Those of us who have been dancing for a while will probably be a bit disappointed at the length of the DVD. 115 minutes sounds long but consists of a 37 minute technique section with only 25 minutes devoted to instruction, 5 minutes of guided stretching and loosening (which happens to be excellent), 3 minutes devoted to practicing the ""BQ Boogie"" -- a dance routine best described as a cute, belly flavored version of the electric slide, and a 3 minute cool down stretch (again this one is excellent.) Other than 10 minutes devoted to learning to improvise, the rest of the DVD is bonus material. However, the included 12 track CD is alone worth the purchase price of the DVD. Twelve groovy belly tunes by Mission to Mars (Vin Scialla) and Turbo Tabla -- the classically trained Karim Nagi, provide the Arabic House soundtrack. Some fun and excellent stuff is found here -- some of it exclusive to this DVD. In the Special Features section, each girl has a solo bellydance performance in traditional costume. ""Call of The Drum with Mal Stein"" is a Drum Solo Performance By Amar Gamal, and ""Dunyavi Gypsy Passion"" is a solo performance by Kaeshi Chai in a Folk or ""Gypsy"" style. There are two video montages -- ""Bellyqueen Around The World"" is of Bellyqueen performances and ""Bellydance Superstars"" is the Bellydance Superstars promo montage you've probably seen before if you own any other Bellydance Superstars DVD. The rest is interviews with the dancers and musicians from this DVD. All of this is available in English or Espanol on the same disc. The Spanish translation is accessible from the Main Menu and includes Instruction, Menus, and Bonus Material.

1992517,4,B0001DMY3C,"I agree with most of the reviews that there wasn't enough content & it was too short & easy, but the instructional ability of the two women were great. They teach slowly at first, then go normal speed for every new move. One of the girls narrate cuing YOUR left & right.
I was able to pick up everything they taught very easily. The constant rock beat was a welcome change to most belly dancing videos when some even don't use any at all. I use this over & over to inspire me to workout even more right after because I feel so giddy & confident after.
The warm-up & cool down have great stretches & it's not hurried like other fitness dvds. They teach hip & shoulder shimmies, some undulations, camels, chest circles & lifts, hip lifts & drops & put it all in routine you can take to the dance floor.
They teach also in Espanol & it comes with a music cd.

After reading ""L. Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""  review, I agree with it 100% percent. The teaching is awesome with plenty of analogies to help you to learn. This is a great addition to anyone who loves to dance or exercise.  I only wish there was more content. I do hope they make another one.

1992518,1,B0001DMY3C,"The instruction is good and the tips on how to incorporate the simple routine into a 4 step dance is okay which earn the dvd a 1 from me, but overall, I found the workout slow and simplistic with no sweat whatsoever.  If you want a good bellydance instructional base as well as a good workout combined with a dance you can learn, buy the Kathy Smith Flex Appeal Bellydance workout.  You'll learn the basic moves from Superstar Ansuya and get a good workout from an exercise instructor who is a guru in the industry.",1102291200,13,515,4.410526315789474

8010901,5,B0001DMY3C,"I've been belly dancing for a year and, yes, its not for an intense workout, but its still fun and still heats me up. It also offers new, fun moves and is good for belly dancers seeking new choreography. Definitely worth buying even if you're experienced at belly dance",1375574400,,269,4.510204081632653
8010902,4,B0001DMY3C,"This DVD offers good basic technique and is well-made.  The music is good and there are lots of bonuses and special features.  Amar and Kaeshi share tips on dancing with a partner/performing a duet and have a small section on improvisation--now that's a first and very handy!!!  I felt like I got a bit of an aerobic workout which is a nice bonus.  I would've preferred it if they taught more moves and a longer choreography, but I'd definitely recommend this DVD to beginners.",1363651200,,477,4.642857142857143
8010903,2,B0001DMY3C,"I got this video since the reviews made it sound like it was a fun blend, taking bellydancing and making it a bit less formal so it could be used for club dancing.  Overall, I was very disappointed.  The instruction was extremely simple and poor.  It did not give pointers to explain how to make the moves look correct, nor how to do them correctly while protecting your lower back.  The workout section is extremely simple, which is great if you're a bad dancer (like me!) but not very fun or challenging in the long run.  The improvisational section was effective at pointing out the ""forest for the trees"" when trying to improv dance, but otherwise not too helpful.  Even the performance sections were disappointing, as half of them were clips from various performances, all set to one song, or were filmed oddly.  There were many times when the camera focused on one body half, and you were left guessing what the whole performance looked like.  Even when the camera zoomed out, it zoomed out too far.  The best part of this video, sadly, is the interviews.  I found them inspirational, and they gave me good food for thought.  If I had rented this video first, I never would have bought it.  Since I've already paid for it, I'm debating whether the little bit of info in the interviews and improv sections make it worth keeping.  If you want a good instructional video, PLEASE check out Jenna's ""Bellydance Basics and Beyond"" -- it is EXCELLENT instruction with tons of pointers and tips!  I'm still seeking a good bellydance workout video, but I like ""10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix"" as a fun and easy set of dance workouts.  Having said all that, the ladies are definitely talented and I would love a quality performance video of them, but I will definitely steer clear of their instructional DVDs.",1233014400,,1817,4.669811320754717
8010904,3,B0001DMY3C,"I rented this title and quickly realized it's not for me (it wasn't intended to be - I've been performing for many many years). Still I went to the performance part and was dissapointed by the gypsy piece.

I've been learning these very moves from different teachers passing them from teacher to teacher, but somehow they don't make any sense if the feeling is not behind them and Kaeshi, a wonderful dancer otherwise, sadly fails to convey the power and the cheekyness that is required for this type of dance. If you don't feel the gesture, it's better to not do it at all!! It just feels silly.

But I have seen her dance in other circumstances, live etc, and I love that woman! she is the cat's meow.",1227139200,,703,4.441860465116279
8010905,5,B0001DMY3C,"This is a really basic bellydance DVD.  I would recommend it for three reasons:  1.)  the dancers look like they are having so much fun, that it's catching.  I'm in a better mood after this--a lot of other bellydance DVDs are almost grim in comparison.  2.)  There is a huge amount of extra material.  If you want to know anything about the Bellydance Superstars, there are biographical interviews and lots of dance solo extras.  3.)  There is an additional CD, so if you don't have music to bellydance to, if you buy this, you don't have to get other music.

What's not so great about this:  in a lot of the moves, they don't tell you which muscles to use.",1224374400,,657,4.391666666666667
