7562798,1,B0194DZBVQ,"Dr. Emily Burns (Marisa Ruby) is locked in a trailer room. Her captors want her to remember what she did January 11th and she hasn't a clue so they dunk her head in a plastic bucket of water. This goes on for a while then they give her some clues...like the year, but her memory is foggy. The audience has no idea either, and since there was no character build-up or previous knowledge it is impossible for us to guess or care.

When we do find out why, it becomes a big ""huh?"" They did what? Because of what? It didn't make any sense. Her whispers were hard to understand too. Anyone who has lived in a trailer could have opened that door in less than 2 minutes and find a bathroom.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Cheap paneling and carpeting. Worse than Saw 3.",1457136000,6,768,4.2534246575342465
7562799,4,B0194DZBVQ,"Clearly a very intelligent, mystery, modern day thriller.  Had my attention throughout the entire movie, kept me guessing at each and every piece.  I will not spoil the ending however I will say that I very much look forward to a sequel as I strongly feel that the makers have every intention on making.",1456099200,,303,4.592592592592593
7562800,3,B0194DZBVQ,"Riddle Room opens up with a young doctor named Emily Burns waking up in a room that she is being held captive in. A guy in a mask opens the only door in the room and informs her that he needs to know about the events on September 11th at 8:30pm. She is not sure what happened on this date, but until she can figure it out she will be held in this room with no means of escape. We learn that Emily has a family that she desperately wants to see again, and that she seems innocent and being held against her will. In the room, she discovers clues to help her try and figure out why this date September 11th is so important to the people holding her in this room. This film really tried hard to keep the suspense going, but after the 40 minute mark it just felt this film was running low on ideas and how to keep the reveal impactful. Which is the biggest negative of this film is the reveal. We all know going into this film that we are going to be along for this ride and try to figure this puzzle out before she does, but the puzzle felt so uninspired and basically bland. When I discovered in the last ten minutes of the film what all this was about, I was ready to just shut off the film right there and then. I lost all interest and just felt duped by the film and not in a good way. The twist in relation to the plot and how the story is laid out to us is just absurd.

 It got even worst when they felt the need to over explain it to us. We are not stupid, if you just gave us a subtle idea of what was going on, we would have had enough right there. This film though felt the need to overthink itself and then have to give us a very wordy explanation into everything we just witnessed. I love films like this, when a total stranger is thrusted unto us and we are with them trying to solve this great mystery, but this film just ran out of steam and could not recoup. The acting in this film was decent enough, the lead actress playing the victim Emily really sold the role. The room itself opened a lot of questions after the reveal happens which made me question the thinking and logic of the whole film. When she discovers clues in relation to the reveal, you will understand this a little bit more. She has this television in her room that goes from her being in the room to her family which also opened the door to illogical thinking. A key scene in the film she is watching her husband running around the house looking for their daughter, but in the next scene we get the reveal which makes that scene make little to no sense. I will not even discuss the drowning scene with the bucket of water, because again when you get to the reveal that scene absolutely again makes little to no sense. This film at 80 minutes went 20 minutes too long. The first forty minutes of this film was creative and had me on the edge of my seat trying to solve this puzzle, the last 40 were mind numbing bad and made the first half look silly in the overall scheme of things. This film was a major letdown. This film was in need of a serious edit and pacing, there is no way the director watched that ending and said,  I am happy with this. He probably thought,  Ok, I can go on to other things now.",1455667200,6,3190,4.07484076433121

8743933,2,B0194DZBVQ,"i have to give it 2* because i watched till the end waiting to see the ""whys"" & ""wherefors"" that never came with sufficient explanation.  i didn't mind the actress' age nor mr potato head. it wasn't scary, period - not even when they did water torture.  but the psychological aspect became a moot point when the story simply ended.  i frankly didn't care if she died via infection, gun or torture at that pointl",1497657600,,411,4.453333333333333
8743934,2,B0194DZBVQ,the ending could have been better... it felt unfinished not knowing what happend.. did she figure it out or no???,1496016000,2,113,4.7
8743935,1,B0194DZBVQ,"if you're going to make a movie about a women looking around a walk in closet that lasts for (what feels like) four hours... at least make her attractive, Watching a past-her-prime stripper talking to the highly annoying but comical ""Mr Potato Head"" about nothing, for no reason between having her head shoved in a bucket (should have let her wear the bucket) is more nonsensical and irrelevant than I could have come up with I guess. I just wanted someone to set fire to the potato sack moron - they didn't. This movie deserves a drivel warning not a star. Move along.",1493683200,2,569,4.533980582524272
8743936,1,B0194DZBVQ,"Generally I like to give films like this a chance. This film was a complete waste of time. Dull and endlessly repetitious, there is absolutely no pay off. The story unfolds with a obviously middle aged woman trying to appear younger trapped in a cheap, bare room. The film tries to give an impression that this is some deep psychological thriller, but honestly it's just hack writing and extremely marginal acting.

There is no resolution and zero opportunity for any real connection to the story or the actress portraying the ""victim"". It's contrived and lacks any kind of devices to hold your interest. I stayed until the end, and I regret every single minute of it.

No value, spend your time elsewhere. Even if it's watching paint dry, it will be more interesting than this drivel.",1480291200,7,785,4.764705882352941

8743938,5,B0194DZBVQ,I love this movie.....even though I kinda figured out the plot but it was clever and I haven't seen another movie like it.,1477526400,2,122,4.3478260869565215
8743939,1,B0194DZBVQ,Horrible movie and horrible quality.  Currently trying to get a refund.,1472256000,,71,5.454545454545454
8743940,4,B0194DZBVQ,My daughter rented this.  She said its a scary movie but not the best she's ever seen.,1461715200,,86,4.0588235294117645
8743941,5,B0194DZBVQ,"I would like  to start off by saying what is up with all the bad reviews. I own over 2000 dvds horror,thriller genre. This one is very off beat andvrefreshing! I would rate it up there with the best of them. Good acting and suspense. It keeps your interest throughout. I expected a ""SAW"" like movie with torture and riddles but received much much more. I don't want to spoil anything but have to say the ending is very emotional and suspenseful. The main character Dr Burns - Marisa Stober does a superb and I do mean superb job in this picture. The emotion consumed  me at the end. With all the movies I own and have seen this doesn't happen to often. Give it a shot. If you like suspense mystery type pictures with a twist you will not be sorry.",1460678400,,747,4.253521126760563
