8627941,5,B00GWGFECK,"Even though I don't have a Region 2 DVD player, I'm having no regrets about purchasing the import version of 'The Garden of Sinners: Recalled Out Summer and Extra Chorus',since this has not only Yuki Kajiura's soundtracks for these two productions,but also includes the unexpected pleasant surprise of an audio drama CD,too(incentive to keep learning more Japanese)!  Shame on Aniplex USA for not including these in their US release,making me buy it a second time. The packaging,booklet and postcards included are excellent quality too!  'Recalled Out Summer' is a movie in two parts,the first half a story set amidst the initial film series,while the second half gives closure to the series(no spoilers from me here,though).  'Extra Chorus' is an OVA that is a better coda to the series than what we originally got,and is also worth watching.  If you're only interested in the DVD content,you can skip this,but if you're a Yuki Kajiura fan who wants as much of her music in a hard-copy format,or a big Type-Moon/ 'Kara no Kyoukai',you'll want this one!",1472169600,,1053,5.0344827586206895
