Outrageously entertaining independant film from TROMA (dismissing their reputation) with a non-stop  barrage of twists, jokes, and visual gags. Excellent surprise ending too.",953769600,7,298,5.930232558139535

916048,3,6304699077,"'The millionaire wants a new thrill, his wife wants the fortune, her lover wants out, and everyone wants to stuff Stephanie in the incinerator.'
from 1989 comes stuff stephanie aka in deadly heat. i gave this thing 3 stars based on ""bad movie"" standards. and low standards they are. the movie tries to be dramatic, funny and sexy and misses all marks. instead we get a twisted madhouse performance with the highlight of the movie coming from the first act. this is due to a cross dressing character whose performance is just straight up creepy. we're talking wack-o jack-o creepy. this character uses proper english to such an extreme it's disgusting. lots of ""indeed"" and ""if you so chose"" type crap. the climax of this openning act of the movie is when this person goes out of character and changes his voice from light soft micheal jackson tone to your average joe and asks for a 7up. riiiiiight. the rest of the movie isn't padded out but gets more and more confusing.  people play multiple characters, chew up dialogue and ham it up all the way. i admittedly was rather preoccupied while viewing this so that may account for my lack of understanding and detail. i chalk it up to having to be in a certain mood for this kind of thing and as in most bad movies, best viewed with a small group of friends to trash mystery science theater style.
for most the cast this was their first and last appearance in cinema, with neil mcgreggory (credited as the cyclist) the exception. and thats stretching it. stuff stephanie is awful with potential to be awful fun.",1203465600,2,1560,4.611510791366906

7876304,2,6304699077,I've seen much worse but it is very boring and stupid. I'm no critic but I would pass on this film.,1499040000,,99,3.761904761904762
7876305,1,6304699077,I made it through 40 minutes of this movie and I gave up. I do not see how anyone could give it 5 stars. I watched it on Amazon prime.,1474416000,2,134,3.5
7876306,1,6304699077,STEPHANIE DOES NOT GET STUFFED INTO THE INCINERATOR. Not even close. Nobody even attempts to stuff her. That's not part of this movie. This film is so slow and it has zero payoff. The title is a lie.,1472428800,5,199,4.2631578947368425

7876311,1,6304699077,With a title like this one would not expect it to be made as a serious movie. But that appears to be what they went for. More drama than comedy.,1443225600,3,144,3.8333333333333335
