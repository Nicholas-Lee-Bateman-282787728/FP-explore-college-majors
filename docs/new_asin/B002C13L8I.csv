8362771,5,B002C13L8I,"Brother Jesse Duplantis delivers another winning compliation of his hilarious stories.  They are real to life and very enjoyable - especially for Christians who are familiar with Jesse's ministry. IF not preaching he would fill houses as a stand-up but this humor is CLEAN and contains bits of Godly wisdom.  Very enjoyable! Wonderful for ""movie night"" at home or as gifts for the lonely or ill. Laughter is the best medicine and this DVD is good healthy dose for sure.",1325203200,,469,4.85
