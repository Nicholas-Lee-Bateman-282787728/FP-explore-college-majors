8089261,5,B000BNGHVM,"I had been looking for this particular DVD set for a while and finally located it where else but Amazon.  I am completely satisfied with the product and it arrived in a timely manner.  Bishop Jakes is in rare form on these DVD's and their messages are just as relevant today as they were when he first taught them.  I was originally looking for ""Vehicles of Grace"" but was only able to get it as a part of this set. I am very satisfied with the entire package.  These are great teaching sermons for both new and seasoned christians alike.",1256256000,,538,4.35
