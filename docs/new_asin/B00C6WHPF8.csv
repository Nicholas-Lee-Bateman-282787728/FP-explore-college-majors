5692044,5,B00C6WHPF8,"We've been Wiggles fans for a long time.  So it was with a healthy dose of skepticism that we ordered this dvd, featuring the new Wiggles line-up.  We have to admit, the new Wiggles are a delight.  Simon, with his deep booming vocals, is an instant favorite with children.  Energetic and talented Emma Watkins is the first female Wiggle and is having way too much fun doing what she's doing.  Lachy could be a big star on his own.  But we are glad he is a Wiggle for now.  The songs are pure Wiggly fun, but with a slightly new sound.  We are very happy with the new Wiggles.  Who wouldn't?",1381190400,8,590,4.243243243243243
5692045,5,B00C6WHPF8,We have been fans of the Wiggles for over 10 years and as usual the They do not disappoint! Do the propellor! We are looking forward to the Halloween DVD!,1381104000,,154,4.166666666666667
5692046,5,B00C6WHPF8,"My son loves the Wiggles, and this DVD did not disappoint.  He was unsure of the new Wiggles, but quickly got over that with this show!  Cute and  good learning messages throughout .",1380844800,,182,4.454545454545454
5692047,5,B00C6WHPF8,"The new wiggles add a lot of energy, fun and humor!  Sure we miss the originals, however after giving the newbies a chance my son likes them too.",1380758400,,145,4.178571428571429
5692048,5,B00C6WHPF8,"We love the Wiggles, old and new.  This video has lots of new catchy tunes and some of the old favorites.  There are cameos by Greg, Murray, and Jeff too!  It was a fun way to introduce my 2yo twins to the new Wiggles crew.  My hubby and I are often caught singing the songs and/or making up our own silly words.  This is the first time there is a female Wiggle and you'll fall in love with Emma.  We have one at our house/car and ordered one for Grandma's house. Enjoy!",1380672000,3,470,4.054347826086956
5692049,5,B00C6WHPF8,"I purchased this DVD at the same time I purchased the CD, and most of my thoughts about the DVD are echoed on that review (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Off/dp/B00BV4AJSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Off</a>).

In some ways, I find the DVD better than the CD.  For one thing, all the intros actually make sense on the DVD!  Also, there are cameos from Greg, Murray, and most frequently Jeff which I found to help ease the transition to the new Wiggles with my kids (it also looks like Jeff is one of the primary songwriters for the new tracks on the CD/DVD).  The new Wiggles--especially Emma and Simon--relate very well to kids, almost better that the original Wiggles did.

I will also say that we end up watching this DVD at least once a day and I'm not yet sick of it.  That should tell you something!",1380326400,,857,5.0
5692050,5,B00C6WHPF8,"The new Wiggles are awesome and so spunky!! What took so long for the girl wiggle, lol. My girl accepted the new Wiggles I think more than the original now having the super adorable Emma. The new song are catchy and cute, the bowtiful song and Simon in the cold water. Highly recommended. They even kept some original songs, rock-a-bye bear, so its still familiar to the kids!!",1378684800,,377,4.5588235294117645
5692051,5,B00C6WHPF8,"As soon as it came, my kids wanted to watch it...and watched it again and again and again.  I wasn't sure if they would be into the WIggles as much with the change of a few cast members but they loved it even more.  The loved the new songs and the new Wiggles...especially Emma.  They are thrilled that there is a ""girl Wiggle"".  They are already singing about buckling up in the car and bouncing around like Bunny Foo Foo.  They also liked seeing cameos from former Wiggles and singing to some of the classic Wiggles tunes!  Loved it!",1375833600,7,535,4.353535353535354

5692078,5,B00C6WHPF8,"Worth every penny! My son started watching the Wiggles when he was about 6 months old (he's now 3), I would rock him back and forth when he was teething, the music and rocking was the only thing that would soothe and distract him. I know some parents don't love the Wiggles, and I certainly am in that boat some days, but this was a really entertaining DVD, we would dance along and Mama over here knows just about all the words and dance moves. When my son started walking he would dance along to the music too. This DVD has provided hours of entertainment for my son and provided me with memories I'll cherish forever. The songs and dancing, even the little banter, are all entertaining. It's upbeat and made my son smile a ton. Definitely worth every penny.",1483574400,,760,4.435714285714286

My toddler (Now 20 months old) LOVES the Wiggles and all of their DVDs. There aren't too many days that go by that we don't have a Wiggle's video or two playing so he can sing and dance along. This one is no different.
And mom enjoys this video too! After having grown up with the Original Wiggles, it was nice to be introduced to the new crew in such a good DVD. The choreography is great and the colors are bright and vivid. The singing and dancing is great and you can tell that the group will be together for years to come.

The little guy spins his arms for the propeller  song. The moment  he wakes up he runs to the tv and starts spinning his arms and handing the dvd over to get it started. Some days when i get to spend time with my grands this  one will be played 5 or more times in one day. I love the new additions of Lachy, Emma, and  Simon. They bring a new level of song and dance to the group. They are fabulous. And its great to see Anthony still wiggling after 2 decades. This one is a  real winner.

I'm soooo glad I made this purchase, he absolutely LOVES it. Even when the video is not on, he'll run up to me and start doing the propeller dance. Even his sister who is 7 months is fascinated by the video. I don't let the kids watch much TV at all, but I'm okay with the Wiggles because it's something we can do together, we can get up and dance and be silly (plus it's not a bad workout for me).",1402358400,,525,3.8703703703703702

5692161,5,B00C6WHPF8,"This is the second newest Wiggles DVD out in the US and I think it's their best. The songs are great and captivate the kids. My nearly one year old loves it and this is the only show that will actually capture her attention and keep her sitting still the entire time. We watch this one over and over. To be honest, I don't mind it myself. This DVD does include a live performance for one song (the Shimmy Shake) but other than that it's also mostly ""regular"" show and videos. Again, I love that because I'm not crazy about the live performances on the DVDs. This DVD includes the propeller (one of the best Wiggles songs with a cameo from Jeff the former purple Wiggle), Simon Says, We've Got the Glasses On (great for kids who wear glasses like my 1 year old), Teddy Bear Teddy Bear (upbeat song and very cute ""teddy bear"" dancing), Meteorology (love this song and it's very 50's sounding - great throwback), Dancing on the High Seas, Peanut Butter (cute song and has a great warning about not sharing ""your sandwiches"" because people might have peanut allergies), Emma (with the bow in her hair) - this one is adorable for the little girls, Simon's Cold Water Blues - this one is my favorite and includes Simon dressed in liederhosen (spelling?) and yodeling - very funny and entertaining to even the adults. Highly recommend this DVD if your kids are Wiggles fans.",1395187200,,1367,4.538461538461538

5692164,4,B00C6WHPF8,"We started our Wiggles experience with Yummy, Yummy, so when we purchased Taking Off, my boys (15 months old) had a hard time focusing on the new Wiggles and the real locations (not a studio). Most of the songs are now too complicated for my boys to follow as they enjoy doing hand motions with the more simpler songs. That being said, after a few months of switching this DVD up with Yummy, Yummy, they are taking to it a little bit more. Their attention can be held through these songs:Simon Says, Do the Propeller, Rockabye Your Bear, Captain Feathersword, and Get Ready to Wiggle. I think in time though they will enjoy this DVD as their comprehension and attention span increases.",1394064000,,685,4.622950819672131

Full of songs that my children are already familiar with (from the ""real Wiggles"" as my 4 year old calls them) to new songs written by some of the new cast, this DVD was well worth the money. I'm thankful they seem to be going back to songs they've written themselves, and embracing what made them ""The Wiggles"" in the first place.

The over-acting is atrocious, and the songs are bland, complex, and simply awful.  My kids both walked away from the television almost immediately when I played this video for them.  Because I purchased from an Amazon Marketplace seller, I'm not willing to spend the time and expense to return the item, but I wish I had selected something else.  This is clearly an attempt to make a profit on a brand-name that no longer has the goods to back it up.  I wasted my money.",1392422400,,611,4.559633027522936

5692172,4,B00C6WHPF8,"I think I would've given this 5 stars if it had more ""(live) performances"" rather than ""videos"" but overall that was my only issue.  My toddler likes to see the live performances much more than the videos because she likes to watch the kids the camera pans to.  This has most and more of the ""new"" Wiggles stuff you see on TV (Sprout at least).  There are a few songs that I've seen on TV that aren't on this DVD but I don't think my 2 1/2 year old notices unless I point it out.  It's about 45 minutes long which is much longer than the 10 minute Sprout segments.

5692179,5,B00C6WHPF8,"As our older kid grew out of the Wiggles, we showed a few of the older shows to our little one and he wasn't that thrilled. That all changed once the new episodes started airing on Sprout. He really responded to the new crew and the songs.

As a parent who has to listen to a LOT of Wiggles songs, I can say that the new tunes are very catchy. I also think the addition of Emma and Simon especially really add a new dimension to the group. Jury is still out on Lachy. It would have been best if Sam had come back, but it sounds like there was some weird backstage drama. It's nice Anthony is still around for continuity. It's also good to see the old crew make appearances, but wow they are looking their age. It really was way overdue for some fresh blood.

The Halloween DVD is also great in case you were interested.

The only bad part is that there are songs that air on the Sprout show that are not on this DVD or the Halloween one. They will be on the Furry Tales DVD that doesn't come out till Feb.

Honestly I'm not sure if the little one will still be into the Wiggles by then. If so I'll certainly pick that up as one of his favorite songs is Say the Dance, Do the Dance and that's on the upcoming DVD.",1389052800,,1212,4.0375

This DVD was a very good deal at $7.96 and also since we have Amazon Prime we got free 2 day shipping.  I would definitely recommend this video to anyone that has kids.

5692187,5,B00C6WHPF8,"I did not want to like the new Wiggles. My eldest is 8 so the Wiggles have been a part of our household for a long time. We adore the original lineup and Sam.

With that said, the new Wiggles are unique and also great. I actually like that they changed to a more harmonic band- this made them easier to accept, like a new kind of music. Emma and Simon hold up the high and low ends of the scale, and Lachey's tenor vocals are a great compliment to them. We saw them in concert as well (the concert version of this DVD) and they were delightful. My 2 year old was transfixed.

We listen to this album along with the old ones almost daily. I have this album on my phone so we can listen on the go. My son loves the DVD so he can dance along. It really is worth it to have both if you have a toddler or preschooler!",1385078400,,812,3.915151515151515

This DVD is filled with special features, including a performance of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star which has Emma, along with two of the Wiggly dancers, dancing ballet in tutus.  Also, if you ever plan on seeing the Wiggles in concert, this DVD is a great way to get your child used to the new cast.  Finally, since I have a daughter myself, I obviously enjoy the fact that one of the new Wiggles is female.

Her favorite is Emma. :-) This has lots of new favorites like Do the Propellor, Beep Beep Buckle Up, Teddy Bear Teddy Bear Turn Around, etc.  but we were disappointed that it didn't include Koala By and Ooey Ooey Allergies, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. Hopefully, it will be on a future DVD. Hoping they'll make a Christmas DVD!",1383091200,,468,4.379310344827586
5692192,4,B00C6WHPF8,"My child is old enough to give up the Wiggles, and frankly, I thought the new line up would facilitate the break up. It isn't after all, the organic coming together of a few Early Childhood Ed students, as the first line up was.

Surprise! We like it! Simon's booming voice is great! Emma, in the yellow shirt, takes the wheel and is not regulated to ""token female"" in what they give her to do. Lachy is, uhm cute, and it is clear they all really like children.  (Emma gave an interview wherein she said there was no audition; the original Wiggles picked the replacements by watching how the chorus people interacted with kids at concerts).

BEST of all, they've returned to their roots--by this I mean, thank goodness, REAL SETS, simple and easy on the eyes, and the group back to interacting with children on camera.  (Those glitzy years of green screen and adult dancers took a toll on my child's affection for the group.)

A couple quibbles--they are whiter than ever--this in a country with a high Asian population and Aboriginal population. Dorothy the dinosaur has been considerably slimmed down. And no, sorry, ONE female is not enough. In the new lineup it was high time for a group that more closely resembled the world's population.

But good enough, entertaining enough, kind enough, educational enough, that my child who can already read and write likes it, a lot.",1381536000,,1377,4.716666666666667
