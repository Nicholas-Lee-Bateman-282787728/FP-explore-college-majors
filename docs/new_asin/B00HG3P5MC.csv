6162255,5,B00HG3P5MC,This stands up to the De Laurentis movie version - closer to the book.  The best looking Irulan of any version.  I have collected all the versions I could find and have been happy with all of them,1462838400,2,196,4.131578947368421
6162256,5,B00HG3P5MC,"I have bought before from this buyer & I definitely would buy more from them. Movies came quicker than I thought & I love them. Invested in a all region blu ray player, worth it. I can get any import and enjoy them without worrying about the region code. Thank you M&L! You always make me happy with what you offer!",1454371200,2,315,4.180327868852459

NOW THE SPICE WILL FLOW.,1453680000,28,324,4.241935483870968
6162258,5,B00HG3P5MC,"While the set is excellent, it left out to much of the book especially considering its length. Instead it is filled with a lot material that while very entertaining, it probably won't sit well with the purists of the book.",1502409600,,222,4.575
6162259,1,B00HG3P5MC,"I don't normally do extremely negative reviews but this mini-series deserves it. Between the wooden acting, unlikable portrayal of the characters, terrible special effects, DVD quality picture, and home-made costumes.. I couldn't finish.

The Lynch movie came out over a decade earlier and the special effects are much better. In the book, Paul was portrayed as an angry but likeable/logical individual where in the movie he was likable and logical. In the miniseries he is just an unlikable brat with a sarcastic mouth.

The Baron is better here than in the film but he is the only character I felt that way about.

The 1984 film, for all its flaws is a much better product. I absolutely feel like I wasted $40.",1496534400,,712,4.819672131147541

6162262,2,B00HG3P5MC,It was a poor effort to fill out the Dune world. The  blue ray was good quality and it was no problem to get it to play in English. But compared to the original movie it fell well short of what I expected.,1488758400,,205,3.7674418604651163
6162263,5,B00HG3P5MC,Loved it,1485648000,,8,3.5

6162265,3,B00HG3P5MC,"This Blu-Ray version has disappointing video quality.  It does not provide significant video enhancement beyond that provided by a standard DVD upconverted on a Blu-ray or UHD Blu-ray player.  I suspect the original series was produced digitially rather than on film; and that this blu-ray version is just an upconversion of that broadcast SD video.

I prefer the Director's Cut version, which has extended and added scenes that further explain plot lines and provide viewing continuity.

Sound provided on this Blu-Ray is 5.1 DTS in German and English.  The Director's Cut version (non-Blu-ray) provides: DTS Digital Surround (7.1) in English; 5.1 Dolby in English; and 2.0 Dolby in English; plus a 5.1 Dolby audio commentary version.

The Director's Cut version is at: https://amazon.com/Dune-Special-Directors-William-Hurt/dp/B0000639EV/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1484167336&sr=8-2&keywords=Dune+DVD+director%27s+cut",1484092800,6,915,6.3983739837398375
6162266,5,B00HG3P5MC,One of the few extended versions of this great miniseries.,1478563200,,58,4.9
6162267,5,B00HG3P5MC,"I will admit that I was a bit hesitant to purchase this German import of Frank Herbert's Dune, which originally aired on the Syfy Channel in December, 2000. I wasn't sure if this blu ray would play on my current equipment, and I was a little frustrated with the case (with everything written in German). Fortunately, this blu ray played with no problems, and it can be viewed in English. This blu ray is a pretty stunning transfer, and the sound is good, too. This is a two-disc set, with the second disc containing part 3 of the series. As for the film itself: this Dune is more in line of how I would envision Dune, as it's not as edgy as the David Lynch movie from 1984. In the 1984 movie, the Dune universe is depicted more graphically as far as the characters, and the settings are more steely and industrial. To me, Dune isn't supposed to be that rough or hardcore; the novel never suggests an edginess. This John Harrison adaptation of Dune is more intellectual and softer in tone, with just the right amount of attitude at the right times. Saskia Reeves is fantastic as Lady Jessica, while William Hurt isn't so stellar as Leto Atreides. I thought that Alec Newman did a good job playing Paul, as well as the fine performance of Uwe Ochsenknecht as Stilgar. Finally, Ian McNeice as the Baron Harkonnen was welcome relief from the Lynch film's Baron. Julie Cox has a certain magnetism and presence to her role as Princess Irulan, and gives the film a big boost. And let's not forget the fantastic musical score by Graeme Revell that really captures the essence and feel of the Dune universe. I will say, however, that some of the wardrobes in this film are a bit loud or eccentric, but not enough for me to give a lower rating. Overall, this blu ray set comes highly recommended as an essential film in the sci-fi genre.",1470960000,25,1827,4.48948948948949
8632626,5,B00HG3P5MC,"OMG this is fan-flippin-tastic!!!! I lost the middle DVD from the SF 3 DVD set I bought sooooo long ago ... and happy w/ the replacement. Love the story, the acting, most of the characters (they could not have chosen a better Jessica, Stilgar, and Chanai...)",1524787200,,258,4.630434782608695
8632627,5,B00HG3P5MC,"I liked everything,  it came on time, and it worked beautifully,  not like the last two Dune movie's before.",1523404800,,108,4.631578947368421

8632630,1,B00HG3P5MC,"Great mini-series. Flawed BluRay, lots of aliasing/edge enhancement on the first disc. Second disc is much better but the colors look too saturated. My DVD looks better, not quite as sharp and colorful, just a little less so. But there is no aliasing. Going to give away the BluRay. Prefer the DVD much better. Can't stand all the aliasing, very distracting. The Children of Dune put out by Umbrella is very, very good. Wish I could get a copy of Dune by them.",1520380800,,460,4.554216867469879
8632631,5,B00HG3P5MC,Wow! Great blu-ray set of this excellent series. Playback is great. Prompt delivery and in excellent condition. Thanks again.,1519084800,,125,5.631578947368421
8632632,5,B00HG3P5MC,This is the German Blu-ray (the US version is too expensive) that i bought hoping it had the original English languauge track - It does! The picture is very sharp and worth spending the extra $$ over the DVD.,1518652800,,208,4.358974358974359
8632633,3,B00HG3P5MC,"a classic, but not to great special effects, I think they overused back green screens instead of using real locations...",1513641600,,120,5.05
8632634,4,B00HG3P5MC,"Cons: Even though this was the slightly cut German version, though longer than the actual SciFi Channel version, except for the scenes where they Fremen were talking in their native language, the main language was English, though one could have picked the German language version.  Some of the special effects weren't that great, nor were some of the costumes like the Still suits, in comparison to the original movie version of DUNE...

Pros: The picture quality was excellent in this Blu-ray version, and watched through an Oppo 4K player on an LG OLED 4K HDTV, the picture quality was stunning, especially the scenes in the Arakeen sets with their colorful columns and floors.  Acting was fairly good, and this was more in depth than the movie DUNE.

The soundtrack was also excellent.  This German version of the DUNE Blu-ray is well worth the money, because it was longer than what was originally aired on the SciFi Channel.",1511827200,,929,4.89171974522293
8632635,4,B00HG3P5MC,"This is a great ~true~ full HD transfer of the TV miniseries.

- German and English audio.
- Optional German subtitles.
- All scenes with spoken Fremen language have burned-in/hardcoded German subtitles, not English.
- All scenes with digital effects/CG are upscaled from standard definition source, since the effects were originally created in SD and were not rendered again for this release. (Firefly did the same thing)
- Plays on my U.S. blu-ray player.

If you're here looking at buying an import just to get this in HD then you've undoubtedly watched this series before and know/enjoy it well enough to want the blu-ray. While annoying, the German-only subtitles for spoken Fremen language scenes don't harm the series overall if you've seen this series before. Same with the changes from HD in non-CG shots to upscaled SD in CG and digital effects shots. It's annoying if you dwell on it, but if you just sit back and enjoy the story and the HD picture quality then it's a great option for owning this on blu-ray. 4/5 stars for not having the option for English subtitles throughout, or even during spoken Fremen sequences.

I, like everyone else here, wish that it would be released in the U.S. on blu-ray. But so far it hasn't been. This is one of the only options for owning this series in HD.",1509494400,3,1303,4.7312775330396475
