8186397,2,B00000IC9B,"For those who want to spend time watching Hong Kong police vs. Triad gangs with their progressive conflict, this effort may fill the bill, although it will be for most viewers merely a cliched and meandering tale that seldom holds one's deep-cut interest, due to some incoherence in the storyline as well as its failure to provide rationale for much of the depicted conduct. Simon Yam plays Lok Man-hwa, a police inspector assigned to work undercover within an organization led by narcotics sachem Feng (Yu Rong Guang), who is nurturing Hwa for greater responsibilities in his cartel when an unexpected arrest attempt of Triad drug bosses results in Feng's fiery death as his car pitches into a harbour. Hwa attempts to resume his former professional and private lives, but a miraculous renascence by Feng during the moon festival, and a clandestine romance with Feng's former mistress Yung (Christy Chung) are developments that may spoil Hwa's planned future. This film is of the Conflicted Loyalty genre, specially favoured by Chinese producers of crime related movies and is lacking in fresh concepts although devotees of this type of affair will probably not care if the policeman bonds with the criminal or his erstwhile moll, but will instead find the graphic violence and lusty explosions that regularly occur to be quite satisfactory, and a lack of chemistry among the various leads will without doubt seem insignificant amid the dazzling choreography displayed by bullet riddled victims before they fall to earth. The production is available with or without English subtitles, the dialogue being in Cantonese (a Hong Kong patois), Mandarin and poor English, and there is trouble with sound synchronicity as several of the principal players loop lines that are not mixed well during a portion of a work also burdened with a score that includes many mawkish Cantonese pop songs.",1138838400,,1885,5.143322475570033

Highly recommended.",1019088000,,358,5.189655172413793
8186399,5,B00000IC9B,This movie was a great thriller. Christy Cheung was superb. She flowed through the movie and gave a stunning performance. I hope to see more of her! This classic cop versus big and Bad guy had a unique twist without martial arts. I loved it!,993081600,,241,4.377777777777778
8186400,5,B00000IC9B,"This movie between a crime boss and an undercover cop, although not an uncommon theme in many Hong Kong action flicks, is unique in many ways.  First, awesome acting by the major characters (Simon Yam, as the undercover  cop; Yu Rong-Guang, as the crime boss; and Christy Cheung, as the girl in  between).  Secondly, the well-proportioned combination platter of explosive  action, character-development, and drama.  Thirdly, the creative  cinematography and direction.  All-in-all, a very impressive offering from  that segment of the Hong Kong action genre that doesn't use martial arts to  invoke intensity and edge-of-your-seat excitement.  A must-see for any  action fan!",943228800,5,675,5.574257425742574
