8407095,5,B003VTKZ6G,"I got this classic match (meaning it's not chopped up, but presented in its entirety) for my husband's birthday.  He loves it and the other tennis classic matches I found to go with it.  It's great finding U.S. Open Tennis matches available on DVD!!!",1367798400,,250,4.659090909090909
8407096,5,B003VTKZ6G,"What I liked best about this match was seeing Sampras dealing with a match in which he played great to win the first two sets convincingly & then carry on with very little left in the tank. He was obviously tired & foot weary.  So, he held onto what energy he could, focused on what he could do & saved what he had left for when he could do the most damage. In spite of how far his game dropped, he still pulled out a tough match under tough circumstances.  A very good lesson for all tennis players to study & learn from.",1355443200,,522,4.058252427184466
8407097,5,B003VTKZ6G,"If you like the contrast of a serve/volley player vs a basline player, then you should enjoy this match-up. Both players play at a high standard and it is Pete's serve that ultimately gives him the edge. The video is of a high quality with special commentary from John McEnroe.",1294099200,6,277,4.56
