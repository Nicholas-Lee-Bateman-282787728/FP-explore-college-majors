7793026,5,0826218946,"As the other reviewer noted, the video quality is terrible, and the sound is the sort of thing that is usual at conferences (mike placement wanders).  But this is a unique video record of some of the great scholars of the 20th century.  I am not sure if there is any other video of Voegelin, but there is certainly nothing else of Lonergan (he was sick at the time) available.  There is some subdued tension in the room (Allan Bloom was an acolyte of Leo Strauss,  whose interpretation of The Republic is seriously controversial), but everyone is unfailingly polite.  The astonishing thing is the range of reference each speaker has to hand, not to mention their deep committment to Plato and to learning in general.  Gadamer's discussion of how he came to be an engaged reader (through his exposure to the George set) is particularly masterful.

It is a credit to the philosophy students of York University in Toronto that they put this on.  There was a later conference at York of similar stellarness with Sontag, Steiner, Spivak, and Baudrillard around 2000, but I am pretty sure that even that group would bow before this one.",1394496000,2,1130,4.729591836734694
7793027,5,0826218946,"It is true that the video and sound quality is sketchy, but Eric Voegelin's spirit shines through the technical imperfections. It is something of a miracle to have even this record of him and several other thinkers speaking in a semi-formal way about some of the fundamental issues of human existence. Eric Voegelin's depth of spirit, brilliant thought, clarity of expression, generosity and lovely sense of humor all are there to enjoy. It is a blessing to have this film. Most highly recommended.",1315526400,5,498,5.0120481927710845
7793028,5,0826218946,"It is precious to have ""the master himself"" on DVD. To be able to experience Eric Voegelin and his genuine joyful personality adds so much to reading his already enticing essays.

I am very thankful that this DVD is available and I will watch it many more times, alone and with likeminded friends.

Thank you!",1239494400,3,309,4.6

funny!  Thank you so much for putting this together because it
gives people the chance to see this guy in action and realize how
much we can learn from his analysis.  It was a real treat to see these towering intellectual figures rubbing elbows together.  Rarely can we witness a dialogue as provocative and rich as this one.",1232582400,3,363,4.553846153846154
7793030,5,0826218946,"An amazing video document. The sound is not the greatest, given the recording technology of the time, but just the fact that it has been recorded and is now available is simply fantastic.

Moreover, the producers of the DVD have put a lot of thought into creating and packaging this product. You can tell they care about the quality of this DVD. They must be commended for all their excellent efforts. Don't wait, buy your copy today!",1230681600,,434,4.636363636363637
7793031,5,0826218946,"After great care has been lavished to preserve the video record of an historic meeting, you can see Eric Voegelin in action, waxing philosophical at a conference populated by other important thought leaders of the twentieth century.  Fans of Eric Voegelin have been eager to see this.  Those new to his work will appreciate the opportunity.

But the most important point is this.  Anyone interested in contemporary philosophy will derive great satisfaction from the content of these presentations.  Those who brought us this product are to be commended.",1225238400,7,553,5.238636363636363
