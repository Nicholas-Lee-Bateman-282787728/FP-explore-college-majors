7813082,3,6301480775,"I didn't  enjoy this one as much as I did Missett's other one--""Let's Jazzercise."" As a 66-year-old woman, I found the routines a bit harder to follow and a bit harder on my joints. I haven't tried the second part of the tape yet--the floor exercises--I fully expect that I will enjoy these far more. I have Missett's ""Stretch and Tone"" video and I like it a lot. So I am looking forward to doing these floor exercises.",1379462400,,419,4.371794871794871
7813083,3,6301480775,"What a disappointment. I like Jazzercise because of the music and the feeling of ""dance"" you get with a workout. This video is a good workout, but the music is simply a background beat. There aren't any of the classic songs I had hoped for and nothing to sing along to as you work your muscles.",1250467200,4,294,4.267857142857143
7813084,5,6301480775,This exercise routine is my favorite of 4 Jazzercise tapes I have.  It gets your heart pumping and works all muscles of the lower body well in the toning segment.  Judi Sheppard Missett is fun to workout with and she always keeps it upbeat.,1174176000,16,240,4.431818181818182
