1236269,5,B00000JPHK,KOLOBOS... WAS A GREAT MOVIE.  IT HAD EVERYTHING. A GREAT CAST... THE  BLOOD AND GORE WAS GREAT... THE MONSTER WAS GOOD... AND THE LITTLE BIT OF  COMEDY PLAYED GREAT.  KOLOBOS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. HERE'S WHY: ONE... THE  CAST.  AMY WEBER DOES GREAT AS KRYA AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTER... TOM PLAYED  BY DONNY TERRANOVA... HE'S GREAT HE'S GOT EVERYTHING.  HE'S FUNNY AND HE'S  VERY GOOD FOR HIS PART.  THE BLOOD AND GORE WAS REALLY GOOD AND EVERYTHING  THAT HAPPENED TO EVERYONE WAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLOOD AND GORE.  THE  FACELESS CHARACTER WAS GREAT AND HE'S NOT LIKE YOUR SLASHER KILLER IN MOST  MOVIES.  HE'S DIFFERENT. AND OVER ALL THE MOVIE WAS GREAT.  YOU SHOULD  REALLY SEE IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE BUT DON'T WATCH IT ALONE...,962755200,2,734,4.565891472868217
1236270,3,B00000JPHK,of course this movie will never win any awards or anything and i would bet anything this movie was straight to video.the acting was kind of bad but the gore and good scares keeps this movie from being a total loss.i don't  know why i loved this movie.at least it wasn't corny.i thought it would be  but it wasn't at all.it was kind of scary!,960940800,3,341,4.230769230769231
1236271,1,B00000JPHK,"The premise of five young Americans gathered together in a house festooned with video cameras so that every moment of their terrifying experience can be recorded on VHS unavoidably brings to mind comparisons with ""The  Blair Witch Project"". Sadly, their experience was considerably less  terrifying than the 80 odd minutes  of hell I had to endure whilst watching  this disappointingly bad movie. However, it did suffice to propound my  belief that well-crafted, suspense laden thrillers (a la ""Blair  Witch"") are infinitely more frightening than this kind of standard  gorefest nonsense. I cannot help but think that those responsible for the  production of ""Kolobos"" were rather confused as to the difference  between frightening and sickening. Admittedly the movie did make me cringe  on several occasions....partly due to images of slicing, impaling and skin  removal, but mostly due to moments of dreadful writing and acting to match.  The cast consummately succeeded in murdering an already ailing script,  which registered precious few instances of genuine suspense. But there were  a couple of highspots....the first victim was cute as a button (until we  got a closer look at her intestines) and the fact that some of our intrepid  party were bored senseless whilst viewing a series of low budget slasher  movies was a beautiful, albeit unintentional, piece of irony.",960768000,3,1376,5.325581395348837

1236273,4,B00000JPHK,"I thought Kolobos to be a highly entertaining and terrifying film. What do the first to guys above expect from a film with such a low budget?  Take a look at recent ""horror"" pics with BIG budgets such as  ""Scream"", ""Urban Legend"" or ""I know what you did  last Summer"", these films are merely laughable whereas Kolobos  delivered sheer horror and was actually quite disturbing. Watch  it.......but not alone!",950745600,9,407,4.840579710144928
1236274,1,B00000JPHK,"After reviewing the DVD version of this film, i thought i would have to review this version as well.  This film was poorly put together the odd gore special effects were nothing special, they just had a large cringe  factor.  The acting was variable between characters mostly apart from a few  exceptions were not so good.  You would have to have your brain examined to  enjoy this or even buy this film.  Still there are a few funny scenes the  girl been forced onto the antler being one of my favorites and this shows  how modern films get buy the film censors now unlike a similar scene in the  B-movie Zombie Flesh Eaters.",950227200,3,626,4.460176991150442
1236275,1,B00000JPHK,"When first viewing this film, i thought that it was a copy of the Blair Witch Project due to the first person camera views.  After about 10 minutes this changes to a third party view after the main cast get to the house,  this is where the film goes down hill and becomes a horror to watch not  that it was scary but because of the poor acting and special FX, even so  there were a few funny moments.",949968000,4,400,4.025316455696203
1236276,1,B00000JPHK,"Because you're going to need it...quick.  During the first five minutes of the film, one begins to realize what a mistake it was to even take the trouble of putting it into the DVD player at all. Although I must say that  the acting was definitely not average.  It was so far below average that it  makes Van Damme look Oscar worthy.  The highlight of the film is the house  sequence, where it becomes obvious that the director actually has some  friends that will loan him their home for a movie that with any luck they  will never have to watch.  Don't pay any attention to the reviewer  above...they're one of the producers!",944006400,4,627,4.469026548672566
1236277,5,B00000JPHK,This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The music and screen effects are definitely a plus. A must see on the weekend with family and friends.,941500800,,150,4.172413793103448
1236278,5,B00000JPHK,"This movie did what most horror films fail to do: it seriously creeped me out. I hear a lot of complaints about Kolobos being a low budget b-rated slasher film with horrible acting and it is, however, I didn't feel that that took away from any of the suspense, action, or horror that it elicits. Kolobos offers up a dish full of psychological terror, gore, creative ways of killing off the characters, plenty of squeamish scenes, and an unexpected ending.
Recommended to real fans of horror.",1091664000,10,491,4.72093023255814
1236279,5,B00000JPHK,"Now, I haven't seen the movie in awhile, so I can't really remember the ending that well.  I seem to remember feeling as though the whole situation simply drove her over the already brittle edge, and possibly developed an obsession with her attacker (this is actually something that can happen in real life).  I give the movie 5 stars, mostly because this movie actually genuinely creeped me out.  I do not scare all that easily these days (though admittedly I first saw this movie when I was still only getting used to the genre after being mortally terrified by the first Child's Play when I was like, 11 and swearing off horror movies until my mid-teens), and that movie really did freak me out.  I figure, who cares if the actors are bad (which they were) or if the script is bad (which it was), the directing, the atmosphere, the gore, and the storyline itself was enough to really get me on edge.  Plus, it's a B-grade horror movie...OF COURSE the actors and script are going to lack...that's like...the rule.  They're supposed to suck.  That's what makes movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre as horrifying as it is...it's so gritty and dirty and bad, it might just be real!",1053043200,4,1179,4.639423076923077
1236280,5,B00000JPHK,"I have 'Kolobos' on video and I just keep on watching it.  Yes it's a low budget film but it's great.  I personally did not find it very scary but it is still a great film.  The atmosphere is superb, the actors are not as good as they could have been but so what. I don't watch horor films for the acting, I watch them for the gore and the gore in this film is amazing an very well done.  I think I understand the ending.  It was all in her head, right?  She slashed her face open because of the Faceless guy who she believes is real and her flashback story was made up.  That's what iv'e come to blieve the endin is aout.
Rent this film, it is great!",1046995200,2,651,3.9236641221374047
1236281,1,B00000JPHK,"of the coveted ""worst movie in history"" award. the intro to kolobos is not that bad, it starts off really strong with a good 20 minutes of getting to know the characters. unfortuanitly the characters are annoying. i do admit, the characters are much better than the acting though. and the acting is much better than the script. the plot-o-kolobos was predicable and had a very obvious ending, a poorly executed attempt at a shocking, mind blowing finale. to say i was completely disappointed with kolobos would be a lie, i did keep my attention, i assume because it was like a bad car wreck, you don't want to look, but you can't look away. kolobos is an awful movie regardless, and at no point during the duration of the flick are you going to say ""WOW, this is so real, all hail kolobos"" don't buy it, don't rent it, don't think about what you just read, turn off your moniter and run away screaming. side note- if you like this movie, you should check out the following-> battlefield earth, the 6th day, Rabid Grannies, Final Destination, Ax 'Em, and countless other movies that are equally horrible.",1021334400,2,1103,4.604060913705584
1236282,5,B00000JPHK,"For me, this is about as good as independent horror gets. Smart script, tight action, and a top-notch cast. Some viewers come down on the ending, but for me that's what made this film so perfect. Viewers may find themselves lost at times, but they'll just have to use their heads a bit. This is a thinking person's horror film where time and place are two concepts that rarely go hand in hand.",1015372800,7,393,4.397260273972603
1236283,5,B00000JPHK,"I don't know wher eyou people are getting these negative thoughts on Kolobos.  There aren't many genuinely creepy movies these days, and even less with enough gore.  Kolobos certainly isn't perfect, but it's a whole lot better than you people seem to think.  How could you people not enjoy the wonderfully done attic scene?  And of COURSE the characters are a little weak, they might not have existed!  The ending makes perfect sense if you think about it.  The lighting scheme (a wonderfully done tip of the hat to Suspiria and Argento in general) alone is enough to watch it.  I don't think most of you know what a REAL low budget movie is.  Watch Redneck Zombies if you think Kolobos was super-low budget.  Sheesh.",1007683200,4,717,4.672
1236284,5,B00000JPHK,"Let's cut to the chase...If you want to see if the beautiful Amy Weber can act..she can. As predictable as the plot is...after half an hour, you should know the ending..or close to it. This is B-Movie campiness at it's best, and there is a lot of Amy to watch (even without any makeup..she is an 11). I purchased this movie here for ...and I don't regret it (even if Amy is fully clothed thoughout).

1236286,1,B00000JPHK,"It's inevitable that certain people will warm to the excessive bloodletting that makes up the majority of ""Kolobos,"" a movie so flat and inconceivably bad that the only truly frightening thing that comes to mind while viewing is that someone actually came up with this; this was someone's idea. The movie, being an independent film, over-emphasizes its gory violence and leaves its less-than-mediocre story, while introducing us to flat, uninvolving characters we have no time to get to know. It's this type of splatter flick which makes such films as ""Friday the 13th"" seem intelligent and frightening (and I'm no fan of that one, either).
The opening does its best to be ominous in its approach to horror, and for a brief second, it seems as if the movie may have a glimmer of hope. A young man and woman in a Jeep stop in the middle of an alley to find a brutally mutilated girl lying in a pool of blood, murmuring the word ""kolobos."" I liked this sequence: we are never given a glimpse of the girl, therefore leading us to believe that the ""less-is-more"" approach will make this movie a success. The rest of the beginning also develops quite nicely, as the injured girl, Kyra, recalls the experiences which lead up to her scars.
Kyra, along with four others, Tom, Erica, Gary and Tina, all respond to an ad in the paper which calls for five people willing to live in a secluded house whlie having their activities caught on video surveillance cameras throughout the property. They all seem to get along well, although some of Kyra's mysteriously grotesque drawings have some of them wondering about her (she also uses prescription drugs, which doesn't sit well with the group, either). So when the bodies begin to drop and they become sealed inside the booby-trapped house, their desperate attempt to escape leads them to accusations again one another and even more dead bodies.
And that's really all the second half is composed of: mayhem and murder, without a moment of rest. There are scenes of violence and bodily harm that are so realistic looking and believable that they are seriously difficult to look at. Seriously. And since there is so much of it, there really is no room for anything else. The story keeps feeding us such images as rotating saw blades flying into flesh, a shower of pure acid, entrails and cut throats, which overwhelm us to the point of regurgitation. And believe me on this: you see everything, which betrays the movie's original approach of ""less-is-more.""
The way I see it is that the filmmakers sought out to make all of this bloodshed the shock factor of the film, without any truly frightening scares. It does succeed in shocking us, yes, but in a totally different way. It was all I could do to finish this movie, because I hate leaving a movie in the middle, and the whole time, I'm wondering just what kind of minds could come up with the images displayed throughout this film.
And to be honest, I should've left in the middle of the film, because the ending is the most confusing and ridiculous aspect of this unworthy story. Without giving too much away, there is much confusion about Kyra's involvement in the events that took place in that house, and you'll see what I mean in the very last sequence after her release from the hospital. Apparently everything did happen, but the movie makes it out to be one of those mind trips where no one believes her, and even the physical facts prove otherwise. And the movie nevers answers that question, nor does it leave a slight hint.
The story itself is strictly juvenile, and like its characters, we never get a chance to get into it or get a feel for it. The gore is a turn-off, yes, but the story does everything it can to put its characters into inescapable situations which almost certainly will end in death. The characters are never developed: we are given some small insight into their backgrounds or present lives, but not enough to sustain any sort of emotion or feeling for them once they die. There seems to be a hint of a romance between Kyra and one of the others, but again, he is killed off so quickly that we don't care. I felt myself comparing my connection to this story to a connection between me and someone I've never even met who lives in another country on another planet in another galaxy... you get the picture.
Actors have no place to exploit any sort of emotion, and even their performances are as flat as the script paper. Amy Weber hints at a performance that wants to burst out of her and be free, but the only thing escaping her lips are controlled sobs and scared puppy faces. Promise LeMarco comes off as totally annoying in the role of Tina: she is just too peppy and upbeat (by the way, she's the first to die). Donny Terranova is Tom, and John Fairlie is Gary, and while both of them try to portray the rough image of strong men, they come off as whimps. Nichole Pelerine plays Erica, the actress/.... who generates little fear in her performance.
""Kolobos"" doesn't even give off the promise of good intentions, except for its video cover. It gives off the notion that it is intelligent and scary, when it is, in fact, the opposite. It is scary, but not in the ways intended. Be sure to have a barf bucket handy when watching this autopsy showcase, and don't expect much from the story or its characters.",985737600,8,5331,4.606729758149316

I was gifted Kolobos for my birthday one year on VHS, I was young and didn't think it would be a good movie judging by the cover. Finally I gave in and watched it, needless to say I LOVED IT! Well after the VCR became inferrior to the DVD player my Kolobos was boxed up and put away. Years later I was spring cleaning and found it, memories came flooding back and that began my search for the DVD. Well I was just devastated when I heard it had been discontinued as a single DVD, I didn't want this master piece sharing a case and disc with something crappy. Thus my search for KOLOBOS on DVD began, months later I found this seller and my prayers was answered. I am so pleased with this DVD I plan to watch it until I have to order a new copy and when that happens I'll be returning to this seller. This movie is beautiful and even though the cover art doesn't really have anything to do with the movie I still love it and hope to some day meet the cast whom portrayed the characters in the ""Titanic"" of horror.",1335571200,,1136,4.098654708520179
7913055,1,B00000JPHK,"There is always something fun about a ""B"" horror film. Weather you admire the solid actors making the best of a tight budget or a director knowing how ""camp"" his movie is and playing it out for fun. Sadly however there are B horror films that are made so badly that even for the absurdity of it, they are painful to watch even for lovers of the genre.
Kolobos is probably one of the worst. The script is practically non existant and full of unanswered questions that even a C movie would have. A group of people spend the night in a house (why?) only to be killed off (because?) by a killer who does it for (reason?). The set is mostly the interior of a house that looks like the one down the street from you. Nothing big and scary..just your average, slightly large suburban house. While I do give some effort to the actors for at least trying, most of the performances are over acted and their lines are childishly written.
So, how bad is it? Is it one of the worst? Probably. Notice how most of the actors NEVER did anything after this movie. One hit wonders. I wouldnt rent this even if I was curious. Check some of the ""good"" reviews and see how many other titles these people have written about. Suspicious? You bet.

Silly, derivative late-nineties slasher fare with an ending you can see coming from a mile (or eighty minutes) away. Basic plot of young-and-beautifuls in a big spooky house getting offed one by one. Some inventive methods of doing the offing, not that anyone's liable to care given cardboard characters and stock setups.

Having said that, I'd like to thank ""Big Brother"" for taking a seemingly mundane and made-for-horror-schlock idea and milking millions of dollars (and British currency) out of the premise.

""Kolobos"" uses that premise as a way for the blood to start spurting.  I enjoyed ""Kolobos"" for what it was.  Not every movie made on a shoe-string budget is going to be sitting alongside Tarantino and Rodriguez for any awards come March/April.

The death scenes, especially the shower, was a great touch.  As was the video that kept playing.  Cutting is a big issue in some circles, in fact, I have seen quite a few chatrooms devoted to the subject.  Trust me, Google it to find out how many cutters are out there.

Kolobos is essentailly a word meaning ""cutter"".

It's creepy in it's overall feel.  But there definitely are some d-grade effects (like the death of the girl in front of the fridge).

For what it is, Kolobos is a good attempt at a now-tired premise, which seemed really novel at the time.

I'd recommend renting for a rain delay ballgame or for a night of ""schlocky over the top horror"".",1149120000,4,1298,4.68141592920354
