6139905,3,B00H7VRDY6,"Espectacular miniserie espaola que al final decepciona, aunque supongo que la culpa la tiene la novela en la que est basada. An as, vale la pena verla por varias razones: las ciudades marroques (fascinantes), la fotografa (maravillosa), la msica, las modas y los automviles de poca. Pero sobre todo, la protagonista. Ignoro de dnde sali Adriana Ugarte, pero salvo que el mundo sea ciego, est destinada a ser una diva del cine. La chica es guaprrima, no acta mal, baila bien, y viste como las grandes Diosas de Hollywood. No desmerece frente a ninguna de ellas. El resto de los actores va de buenos a regulares.

Entre los defectos de la serie, el sonido (psimo -los dilogos requieren subttulos que el BluRay no incluye), el sacarinoso final de la trama (ridculo, por no decir risible), dos o tres errores histricos, y la mana polticamente correcta de dividir la Guerra Civil Espaola entre buenos rojos y malos fachos. En una burda escena, una seora gorda y petulante celebra el alzamiento franquista porque ya ""era mucha risa y alegra"" en la Repblica. En cambio, todos los comunistas aparecen como personas buenas, lindas, valientes e idealistas -Voooooy!

Por ltimo, los encargados de la produccin temieron que el pblico fuese tan tonto que no supiese distinguir a los alemanes, o al menos as parece, pues a todos los visten como generales de la Wehrmacht con brazaletes nazis. Lamento decirles que no existieron jams tales uniformes. Nunca nadie, ni Hitler mismo, se visti as. Y siendo una pelcula sobre MODAS, resulta un ""faux pas"" engorroso.

En fin; vean la serie ustedes y sean los mejores jueces. A m me gust ms ""Isabel"".",1443484800,,1628,4.870036101083032

8630663,5,B00H7VRDY6,"This is one of those rare seamless productions that take you through several countries and two wars with a gorgeous heroine who becomes a spy for the British, first in Morocco, where she has landed right before Spain's civil war in the late 1930's,  then back to Spain when the war is over, to continue to spy on the well-placed German ladies who come to her dressmaker's shop. They have husbands in the embassy or in the military, or are personal friends of Hitler's. The charming, beautiful and poised protagonist quickly develops a knack for spying, and develops a code of dots and dashes on her dressmaking patterns to pass information on to the Allies. She also goes on to Lisbon, to spy on an importer who is suspected of having strong ties to the German regime. Fine silks and fabrics being among the items he imports, he uses this as an excuse to invite her for a visit and she uses it to acquire some very sensitive information. This is an exceptionally well-scripted piece. Historically accurate, we learn a great deal of how Spain's civil war affected its people, how Spain existed for the working class before and after the war, how ex-pats lived in Morocco in the late 30's, and how this young  woman struggled to become very successful, and at the top of her fields. In there, too, is one's fair share of cliffhangers, beautiful clothing, automobiles, interiors, furnishings and architecture. The characters are well developed, and one becomes attached to them. There is, of course, a fair share of romance, but, this being an English lover, there is not the unrestrained passion of the Latin, but it has the appropriate humour and self-restraint of the British ! Everything works seamlessly !",1486339200,,1707,4.783050847457627
