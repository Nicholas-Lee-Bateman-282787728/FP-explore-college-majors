7966478,5,B00006ADG5,"I am not a great Vestal Goodman fan, however, that said this is an enjoyable DVD to watch.  She has some very talented guests on the program with her.  In my case just having Janet Paschal sing was worth the price of the disc.  That is not taking into count, Dottie Rambo, Larnell Harris or any of the other great gospel music artists on the disc.  I highly recomend this disc for any Southern Gospel fan.",1290211200,,405,4.2894736842105265
