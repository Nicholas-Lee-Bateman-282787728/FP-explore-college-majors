8635626,1,B000A3ORKG,First off the video quality is terrible and the audio seems to be a half a second off from the video.  It's really hard to navigate the DVD menu.  Most importantly Manchester United sucks and should perish forever.  This is a waste of money.  The only reason I purchase this DVD was to compare it to the quality of Arsenal's DVD.  There is no comparison.  I regret this purchase.,1152489600,,379,4.420289855072464
