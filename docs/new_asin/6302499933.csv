Please, someone put this movie of DVD or Blue Rae.
Many thanks,

7826735,5,6302499933,"A CIA agent named Doug Matthews (Michael Dudikoff) goes to Iraq to save his imprisoned brother against a diabolical defector. That's the whole movie. ""The Human Shield"" is like Noah's Arc, it brings splendor to many. I was dumbfounded with the thrilling action scenes which happened in this movie, totally deserving of an award (not really). Praise the heavens for this motion picture! Even the love triangle that forms is too much! Again, ""The Days of Our Lives"" would be jealous. Too bad this movie is not on DVD unlike all of the other Michael Dudikoff Cannon Films affiliated movies. Please MGM!",1044144000,2,599,4.882352941176471
