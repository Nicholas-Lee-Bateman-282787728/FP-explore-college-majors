7881882,4,6305046328,"The photographers did a really great job.  But the editing...The shots are too damn short!!
  The individual cuts in this video are soooooooo beautiful, they'll make you want to see more.  Unfortunately, most shots last only a few seconds.
  Great video anyway.  They even have a shotlist on their web site...Good reference for your next trip to paradise.",1032480000,,355,5.017241379310345
7881883,4,6305046328,"Spectacular views and wonderful music accompany this 'music video' tour of Hawaii.  If you'd like something more natural and virtual (also Award Winning), check out ""Hawaiian Dreams"" on Amazon here.  Without music and quick cuts- you feel like you're laying on the beach listening to the rolling surf and sea birds.",995241600,3,315,5.1568627450980395
7881884,5,6305046328,"Whether purchased for relaxation or simply a taste of the intense scenic beauty that is Hawaii, Al'i'Productions video will leave you well satisfied.  Volcanoes, underwater scenes and waterfalls galore matched with  a hauntingly beautiful musical score, this video will have you calling your  travel agent in no time. I've paid more for ""travel"" videos which  did not have this quality.",950227200,12,386,5.383333333333334
