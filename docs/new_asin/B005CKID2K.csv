8465543,1,B005CKID2K,"A propaganda film trying to depict the SOVIETS in a light that is inaccurate, as if they went to Afghanistan with good intentions.",1466726400,,130,4.695652173913044
8465544,2,B005CKID2K,"To call it an overview would be generous.  The documentary does not address the reasons for the invasion in the first place, does not account for the political reasons behind the war, nor of the actions on both sides that led to opposition or support of the Soviets by various Afghan tribal factions, and most glaringly, completely ignores both the role of the Stinger missile supplied by the United States (and the main reason for the Soviet's losses that ultimately led their leadership to give up on Afghanistan occupation), and the radical Islamic fundamentalist elements that eventually became Al Qaeda and the Taliban and dominated the country following the Soviet withdrawal and factional conflicts between warlords.

The documentary soft-peddles the Soviet role, and gives them more dignity in withdrawal that they actually had in defeat.",1415577600,,846,5.2592592592592595
8465545,5,B005CKID2K,"A well-scripted, well-photographed, and cogent analysis of the progress and outcome of the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.  It offers insights into the manner in which the two sides fought differently and how each side achieved some of its aims.",1407110400,,261,5.214285714285714
8465546,3,B005CKID2K,This is a good summary of the Soviet Afghan conflict. It's good for those who know nothing about the conflict. It's not an in depth documentary.,1369699200,,144,4.576923076923077
