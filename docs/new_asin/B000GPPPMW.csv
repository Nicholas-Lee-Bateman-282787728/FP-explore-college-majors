8133827,4,B000GPPPMW,"I forgot how dark spirituality could be in Blake's day - his vision was wonderful but......not really to my taste for it.  But this disc is very well done, so rated it four stars.",1433289600,,179,4.264705882352941
8133828,5,B000GPPPMW,"I've now watched this documentary several times. The images of Blake's art are beautifully filmed, interviews with knowledgeable scholars are insightful and informative, provides a comprehensive overview of Blake's life and work, including his poetry. I'm an English teacher and would show this film to my students as an introduction to Blake's poetry.",1395100800,,352,5.660377358490566
