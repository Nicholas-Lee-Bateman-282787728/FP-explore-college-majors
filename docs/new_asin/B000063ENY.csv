8509223,5,B000063ENY,"Thanks Josie,
I'm very pleased with the Advance Salsa Videos that i purchased a few months ago. They were extremely detailed oriented, with excellent explanations on timing, lead, follow, footworks and posture. As an aspiring dance instructor (C.D.T.A), i use your videos quite regularly in Salsa Classes.
Sincerely,
Michael",1038355200,3,324,5.63265306122449
8509224,5,B000063ENY,"Josie has a unique way of breaking down the steps very lucidly. Due to her world travels in 2000 and 2001, she has packed the latest moves of the salsa club scene around the world into this video.
I have learned many of them in only 1 viewing.",1032134400,4,243,4.083333333333333
8509225,5,B000063ENY,"I have all of Josie's videos!!. I purchased her two new videos as soon as they became available. I absolutely LOVE both videos 8 & 9.  I am a trained dancer and have purchased many videos and taken dozens of latin dance classes from dozens of latin dance instructors. I have always wanted to take lessons from Josie, but I have never been able to. I believe these videos are better because I can go as slow or as fast I like, I can put her on pause when I need to take a break without having to pay extra!!
These new videos are amazing,they both have very clear and concise instruction and are very nicely organized which makes them easy to follow (even for my mom). Before Josie's videos I felt that instructional dance videos were useless, but you have  to try them and see for yourself how valueable and useful they actually are. These videos will help you become a beautifully trained latin dancer. If you just learn a few of the combinations you will blow people away on the dance floor. All the the steps and combo's in her new videos are what's hot right now, she is so on top of what's going on in the Salsa World, in fact I think she's a trend setter in the Salsa World. Everybody wants to either dance like her or dance with her. Becuase of these new videos I feel that I truly dance like her. Not only is she gorgeous, but it is obvious how professional she is. They are  also fun videos to watch with your friends. I highly recomend both videos to anyone who wants to learn how to dance Salsa from a REAL professional Dancer. They are worth every penny.",1020297600,8,1565,4.280405405405405
8509226,5,B000063ENY,"I was so happy with previous videos that I previously purchased of Josie's that I couldn't wait for the latest ones.
And as expected it was worth the wait and the money. Everything is explained in such detail that you can't help but to learn all the patterns and techniques easily.
It has added many other techniques and patterns to my dancing that I know would have cost me an arm and a leg if I had gone to get an instructor myself.
I have recommended these new videos, 8 & 9, to all my friends.
Can't wait to see what is next!",1016668800,3,529,4.145631067961165
