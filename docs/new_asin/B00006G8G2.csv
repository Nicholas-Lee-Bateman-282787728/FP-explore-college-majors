7968408,5,B00006G8G2,"I purchased this DVD after having anticipated its release for quite some time. And I must say that I was not at all let down! Anastacia is a vocal powerhouse and a diva in the making. The behind the scenes footage of the making of the video is first rate. It's something worthy of MTV, but unfortuately it won't appear there. The music video itself is marvelous, having been directed by Dave Myers. Anastacia is nothing short of stunning and even funny. This video offers a look into the life of a superstar on the rise.",1032134400,3,520,4.427083333333333
7968409,5,B00006G8G2,"This dvd is 30 minutes in length. It shows the making of the video which is 3 days of Anastacia being her cool self. It gives you a great insight of what Anastacia is like outside of the spotlight and let me say this has made me an even bigger fan. There is about eight different pages of biography of the past and very current information. You can't find out this information on her website. There are several pictures from the gallery which you can find on her website. Last but not least the video of ""One Day In Your Life"" the U.S. version is also on this dvd. An added plus to this dvd is the 5.1 dolby digital sound throughout the dvd.",1030406400,3,641,4.17741935483871
