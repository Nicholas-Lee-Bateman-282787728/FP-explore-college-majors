7071783,4,B00UXWCPFI,"Shio Ogura is a Japanese high school student with an obsessive love of guns and military. This alianates her from her more normal classmates, but during a class trip to Taiwan it seems like one of them might be willing to befriend her. In Shios moment of happiness, she is attacked by monsters and the area turns into a war zone. In order to save her new friend, she must join forces with agents known as E-Gene Holders and discover her own e-gene - the soul of Oda Nobunaga, one of Japans greatest warlords.

I started watching this on a whim and was surprised to find myself continuing all the way to the end. I was interested in Shios slightly unconventional attitude (she had lots of fun fighting and killing monsters, but it wasn't exactly how she had planned to live her life). As with any series involving historical characters, it was fun to see who they brought in and what weird powers they might have. My two favorites were Newton's power of gravity manipulation and Gandhi's force field ability.

But the thing that impressed me the most was the ending. This isn't a very complicated series and the characters don't get a whole lot of development, but the ending contains a nice twist, a pretty good explanation for events, and a rousingly fun battle scene.",1427760000,30,1269,4.610619469026549

8708659,4,B00UXWCPFI,"When I first looked into Nobunagun, I found that it wasn't exactly a critical darling; some critics enjoyed it, but most reviews I saw seemed to put it down as a generic and uninspired show soon to be forgotten. However, I bought it believing that I could still find enjoyment in it despite its lukewarm reception, and I'm very happy that I did. Nobunagun isn't a masterpiece that should be watched by all, but it is an enjoyable show that I think a lot of people can have fun with.

In terms of plot, our main heroine is Japanese teenager Sio Ogura, a somewhat awkward girl who is fascinated by all things military; guns, tanks, warships, planes, she nerds out over all of it at some point. While on a class trip to Taiwan, the country is besieged by aliens referred to as ""Evolutionary Invaders"" who destroy everything in sight. In the middle of all of this, Sio comes to understand that she is an E-Gene holder, an individual who harbors the soul of one of the history's greatest figures (in her case, Oda Nobunaga, a 16th century Japanese general who united Japan through his ruthless conquests) and is granted superpowers as a result. She takes up the fight against the aliens and is drafted into an organization called DOGOO which is made up primarily of other E-Gene holders (she befriends people with the souls of Jack the Ripper, Isaac Newton, Gandhi and Galileo, to name a few). Teaming up with this merry band of misfits, Sio takes the fight to the aliens.

Nobunagun's plot isn't anything particularly original or intricate; it's honestly pretty straightforward and easy to keep track of. The aliens aren't ever treated as anything besides murderous monsters and there really aren't any interpersonal conflicts creating tension within the groups. However, Nobunagun's charm rests on our protagonist, and while Sio isn't a particularly deep or conflicted individual, I found her to be both endearing and entertaining. She's not quite an unstoppable warrior, she's a kid who is often terrified at the circumstances she is put in and simply does her best; her inexperience and otaku tendencies make her come off as adorable and easy to cheer for. The supporting cast is what I feel brings the show down, as a lot of Sio's allies feel either unnecessary or underdeveloped; since this isn't a long show, not too many characters get to stand out, but I do wish more time was spent exploring who these young heroes are, not just the badass things they do.

As for animation, the show definitely isn't the prettiest thing out there, but I thought the visuals were for the most part serviceable. The animation isn't particularly fluid like other action anime, but I still found enjoyment with this more simplistic take on things. Character and monster designs aren't anything we haven't seen before, but I feel the show makes good use of color which, in my opinion, makes up for the less than stellar designs.

If there is one thing that I felt disappointed about, it's the lack of extras/special features in this package. I didn't expect all that much, but it would've been nice to get something along the lines of a creator interview or ""Making Of"" clip, just something telling me about the show's inception. You may not care about that kind of thing, but I think it's nice to get insight into how these things are made. It's no big deal, but I would have liked the option.

Anyway, Nobunagun isn't a show that you need to watch, but it is something I recommend, especially since you can now buy it for about $20. It's nothing thought-provoking or philosophical and there's not much complexity to the plot or most of the characters, but I found it to be a fun show worth my time. There are certainly much better action anime on the market, but if you're like me, you may just want something basic that you don't have to think too hardly about. Is Nobunagun an unmissable masterwork that all anime fans must watch? No. Is it fun and entertaining in spite of its flaws? Absolutely.",1495843200,,3984,4.7020057306590255

8708664,5,B00UXWCPFI,"I originally was going to pass this series up based on looking at its cover, and glad I didn't.  It's a comical, action packed series with an interesting concept.  I ended up buying the blu ray to add to my collection of anime and to introduce to some friends who also enjoyed the series.",1456704000,3,288,4.314814814814815
