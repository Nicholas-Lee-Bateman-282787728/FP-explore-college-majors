5790987,5,B00DCRE9LY,"Great Movie! Thought provoking! I would recommend this to anyone who is into political thrillers! A must watch, a great movie!",1377734400,2,126,5.0476190476190474
5790988,4,B00DCRE9LY,"Found footage and faux documentary films are over done and seem like an easy way out for lazy filmmakers who can't tell a compelling story or develop interesting characters, still some are better than others.  ""The Conspiracy"" is one of the better ones. Like ""Lunopolis"" the found footage is interspersed with interviews from ""experts,"" and, disturbingly, real footage from world events we'll all recognize, giving the documentary an authentic feel.  It feels like a documentary.  It's also disturbing and creepy, and feels like a slow burn thriller.

The filming was expertly done and the music... WOW!  The music was impressive, especially the music for the ceremony scenes.  I was surprised to read on IMDB that the composer hadn't scored many films. Well, his music captured the mood and character of this film well.

The Canucks can mark one in the ""win"" column over this movie.  If you enjoy found footage or conspiracy themed thrillers then you will probably enjoy The Conspiracy.",1377388800,6,987,5.086956521739131
5790989,3,B00DCRE9LY,"This movie is fun, especially for those who find a lot of the circulating conspiracy theories very intriguing.  My one thought through this entire film was:  I wonder if Alex Jones has seen this movie and if so, what did he think?

The way it was shot reminded me of The Blair Witch.

I would rather rent this movie than buy it.  It was fun for a lazy Saturday afternoon.... and who knows, maybe the conspiracies are all true.",1377302400,12,426,4.341772151898734
5790990,3,B00DCRE9LY,"I watched the whole thing, which is more than I can say for most movies that have come out recently. It was pretty mediocre.",1376956800,5,124,4.208333333333333
5790991,4,B00DCRE9LY,"I watched the trailer for the film and was intrigued and saw that it would be released on the internet within a few weeks so I made note of it and moved on. Today I saw an ad on another site for the trailer again and after watching the trailer again I was still interested so I decided to give it a watch.

First off I will say I enjoyed the film, and I think if you watched the trailer and you were interested in the movie based on the trailer you will enjoy it. If you watch the trailer and it does nothing for you then skip it, because it is exactly what it promises to be. I even thought that the trailer would be a bit misleading and it would be bad, but it wasn't. If you want over the top action, a roller coaster ride of thrills, or out and out suspense this isn't going to quench your thirst for those things.

Do not get me wrong, it has it's moments. There are a few twists and turns, but overall it is what you want it to be after seeing the trailer. It is well made, doesn't look like a really low budget film. If you have a problem with the found footage idea (i.e. Blair Witch or Paranormal activity) then you will likely take issue with The Conspiracy, although I saw both of the former movies mentioned and thought this movie was far and away better, but that is a matter of opinion. If you are into conspiracy theory culture you will definitely get a kick out of the movie, but it is absolutely not a requirement. Overall it is a good movie that did exactly what it set out to do.

I give it a 4 out of 5.",1376611200,28,1523,4.003289473684211

I am NOT a big fan of ""found footage"" movies, due mostly to their tendency towards their shakey cameras. But The Conspiracy is shot documentary style with a nice steady camera. No need for sea sick pills afterwards. Is this movie scary? No. I'd call it suspenseful. It's a great story told in an imaginative way. If you like documentaries and enjoy speculating about conspiracy theories, then this movie will both educate and entertain.",1458864000,,528,4.688172043010753
5791001,4,B00DCRE9LY,"Not a ""found footage"" piece of garbage, but rather a fake documentary with enough real life moments that it manages to feel like a documentary for the first half of the film. With well acted parts, especially by conspiracy guru Alan Peterson playing the subject of a conspiracy ducmentary, takes a long time to boil into an actual movie, but the slow pacing and steady eerie but still explainable moments do add enough tension and suspense to an otherwise blaise setup. A weak epilogue and an ending that's easy to see coming are the only detractors.",1448928000,,550,4.739583333333333

5791005,4,B00DCRE9LY,Very interesting & creepy...it definitely makes you think. Plus i love found footage documentary style movies & this is definitely a good one.,1435708800,,142,5.217391304347826
5791006,5,B00DCRE9LY,"The story in The Conspiracy was a pretty captivating conspiracy theory that flowed logically and seamlessly. The use of actual known prevailing conspiracies, that run rampant on the net along with one of the darkest known cults of human history, amped up the commanding plot. The style in which The Conspiracy was shot played out like a true documentary with softer moments of commentary and reflections from the characters, this created a more emotional connectivity for me that sometimes is lost in found footage films and actual documentaries. The fact that this film plays out as a believable documentary with a convincing conspiracy theory, and does so with very little flaw, is a testament to what can be achieved with the subgenre if care and consideration is taken into account. I honestly believe the conspiracy exposed within this film-even though I know it is a fictional film-it hit all my conspiracy theory nightmare sweet spots!

The drama and suspense is the man drive that moves this film forward, relying totally on the acting and camera tricks to create the intense melodrama from start to finish. It works great in The Conspiracy. The dialog flowed effortlessly and came off genuine. It didn't feel really forced or over scripted. The main star is the actual conspiracy itself. It is a major player in the real world online conversations and framed by one of the most interesting and aloof cults that ever existed. The Mithraic cult of ancient Rome.  You can (not that I have entertained such notions-yet) literally red-line the connection between events, religious backgrounds of people of power, Mithra origin story and cult beliefs to the point of paranoia. It was done in the film with eerie, believable implementation. I left the film with just a bit more fear and paranoia about the world around me, even questioning the truth of conspiracies as well as the truth presented to me by educational tools offered in our society.

The Conspiracy is a true horror story but if gore and standard creep affair is your thing then this film may leave you feeling a bit empty. However if you are a fan of any type of horror, and enjoy being taken on a thrill ride through story-regardless of the amount of blood splatter or grue-then The Conspiracy will deliver 100%. The clever ways the film is shot using innovative camera tricks in ways that haven't yet been over indulged in the found footage subgenre add the chilling suspense. The film really does prove that there are still some pretty stellar stories left to be told and found footage is still a viable means to tell those stories.",1432512000,3,2603,4.858108108108108

I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1428710400,,113,6.125
5791009,3,B00DCRE9LY,"Very strange conspiracy movie. It is intelligent and obviously made with love. Like many indies though, it suffers from bad acting. Often, regular people with no experience are given roles and they are as wooden as the emcees at the awards programs. This is far better than your Artisan movie, but sometimes it's hoaky. For a plot synopsis see the page on Amazon. I don't usually like to get into plots, however this one is really an homage to FRINGE in a way. It's not a waste of moey, far from it, but I would not spend more than 5 bucks on it. Better yet, find it on Netflicks.",1428451200,,580,4.330275229357798

That can't change the fact that I still think there are meetings like this going on somewhere,  and this movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's great.  I don't understand how this film isn't bigger than it is... oh wait.... yes I do.  Anyways,  be prepared to get fully sucked into the world of ""what ifs, what happened"" etc. ... your heart will be racing and I'm sure you'll be googling conspiracy stuff afterwards or finding yourself watching hours of YouTube videos looking for ""The Truth""... which you'll never find.... and if it's anything like this movie.... watch out!",1421020800,,668,4.635593220338983

5791017,4,B00DCRE9LY,very good for budget,1412812800,,20,4.25
5791018,2,B00DCRE9LY,"For all intents and purposes, I went into The Conspiracy under the perception that it was a fictionalized extension of existing conspiracy theories. The idea of taking the worlds talked about by internet subcommunities & playing out the theory of ""What if it's all real"" sounded fun and novel. What I didn't seem to grasp, however, was the fact that ""The Conspiracy"" is just as much a believer in the fictitious worlds as the subjects that it almost seems to mock in its' opening scenes. It takes some serious balls for a movie to repeatedly play footage of 9/11 & the Kennedy Assassination, paired with out-of-context quotations to weave a fiction out of history. The sort of artistic decision either made by a devout believer of the gospel, or a hand of parody so skilled that it becomes indisputable from the subject. I kept waiting for The Conspiracy to surprise me, and take advantage of its' juicy subject matter. Instead, I felt like I sat through a lecture about the looming New World Order under the false pretense of entertainment.
Found Footage is a technique beloved by the horror community because it grounds a concept in reality, then proceeds to introduce elements of the supernatural to upend our understanding. The directors of The Conspiracy clearly know how to set up a good found footage plot, but seem bizarrely ignorant on how to execute it. The majority of the film is presented as documentary - jumping between interview segments and field recordings. The issue is that every bit of footage shot on ""the streets"" looks absolutely nothing like actual documentary footage. The cinematography and staging are completely unnatural. It's competent & aesthetically pleasing - but drags the viewer out of the experience at every possible moment. It's not a case of unwillingness to look unpresentable, though. The entire last act of the film is shot on lapel cameras, with many scenes borderlining on being unwatchable.
Overall, the film feels - ironically - like propaganda for a hard agenda by a force that refuses to be negotiated with. It's ""God's Not Dead"" for the 9/11 Truther community, a point nailed home by the fact that upon completion - Netflix recommended me various classics such as ""Zeitgeist : The Movie"". This piece of s*** is no better than a Saturday morning cartoon that promises innocent fun and adventure, before cramming biblical values down your throat. Unless you've already agreed to the doctrine therein, don't bother with The Conspiracy.",1412467200,,2482,4.983132530120482
5791019,5,B00DCRE9LY,"This movie has legs; I continued to think about it and experience it long after the credits. In fact, I bought it after renting it. I admit that when I chose to watch it I initially thought it was an actual documentary because it was in the documentary section. SPOILER: It's another in the long list of pseudo-documentary movies using the found-footage conceit. However, this one truly works. Not only does the movie take the preposterous rantings of conspiracy theories and make you feel like they could be real but the twists and turns, especially in the third act, are pitch perfect. They're perfect because I should have seen them coming but didn't. As a mystery, everything is fair play and in hindsight unavoidable. Moreover, the acting is excellent in the movie. The three leads are great but Alan C. Peterson as the initial conspiracy theorist Terrance is brilliant. Honestly, he delivers his lines and a spot-on performance. He's assisted by very capable dialogue, as are the other two leads and true protagonists, Aaron Poole and James Gilbert. They also knock it out of the park with Poole slightly better in his role, more natural, than Gilbert. In the end, you root for these characters and care what happens to them. I think that's why the movie haunts you even afterwards. The movie definitely is a slow burn that creates a spooky ambiance, features an incredibly appropriate and supportive soundtrack, and plays into our fears; it will genuinely shock you at times. If you watch it, watch it to the end: the second act may be only good (never bad) but the first and third acts are incredible.",1412121600,,1609,4.7913669064748206
5791020,2,B00DCRE9LY,"I simply never liked any of the characters nor did I ever really like the story line. In short, there was nothing about this movie that I liked. I wouldnt rent it again if I knew then what I know now!",1411776000,,200,3.902439024390244

5791022,3,B00DCRE9LY,"This movie starts out pretty good but midway devolves into a formulaic horror flick, akin to 70s low budget fare.  I was hoping for more of conspiracies, less kitsch.  The actors were good but the film just wasn't sure what it wanted to be.  Not deep enough or serious enough for true conspiracy theorists.",1409788800,,306,4.62962962962963
5791023,3,B00DCRE9LY,Was a great movie.,1408406400,,18,3.75
5791024,5,B00DCRE9LY,"Decent movie based on facts, real secret societies, factual people and true events.  I could identify them all as soon as they were introduced in the movie.  What this means is the film makers did their homework.  If you find the things and people mentioned in the film interesting, Ill give you a few free pointers on where to look. First Ill identify the fictional character/event/group and next to that will be the true entity.

A) Chance Family  JP Morgan Chase Manhattan Bank and the people behind them (Rockefeller, JP Morgan, et al);
B) Terrence  Alex Jones;
C) Tarsus Group/Tarsus Meetings/Tarsus Retreat  Bilderberg Group yearly July meeting and Bohemian Club yearly meeting;
D) Mark Tucker  Jim Tucker;
E) Tarsus Retreat and Bull Hunt  Bohemian Club homosexual orgy and Cremation of Care ritual;

A couple of key notes.  Tarsus Retreat members use Freemasonic third degree handshake of thumb on middle finger knuckle.  The young men in the retreat (in the film) are the homosexual prostitutes brought to the retreat (the real Bohemian Club retreat) for sex with the all-male participants.  Alex Jones did indeed break into the Bohemian Club meeting and film the Cremation of Care, but only for a few hours on one day.  The retreat is two weeks.  In the Bull Hunt ritual they murder an unsuspecting sacrifice.  In the true Bohemian Club ritual, the Cremation of Care, nobody is hurt.  They burn a dummy.  Only the male prostitutes get their butts hurt, but they get paid for that.  The black Tahoe and the guy on the bicycle following reporters around are real and based on a Scientology practice of harassment of reporters and people who leave the cult.  Bilderberg and Bohemian Club meetings order real cops in uniform who know nothing about the groups and their activities to follow people around and make sure nobody gets hurt.

I like the movie, but the one mistake the film makers made must be pointed out.  At the end they have a woman who works for Tarsus vouching for the group.  This is fully incorrect for these are 100% all male secret societies where women are useless, suppressed, and hold no office.  The only woman on earth who would ever say anything nice about the real secret societies portrayed in the film is Hilary Clinton and shes your next president, so don't say anything bad about her.  Her best line ever?  So what if people died in Benghazi?  Its time to move on.  I want to be president.  And so she shall.  Because Americans are the dumbest people alive.",1407542400,5,2493,4.757009345794392
5791025,4,B00DCRE9LY,"A well thought out thriller that raises a lot of interesting questions long after it's over.

5791028,4,B00DCRE9LY,Just excellent. Of course I prefer the first half to the second but that's to be expected. The guy that plays the theorist in the beginning makes the movie for me. Maybe I see a little of myself in him.,1400544000,,202,4.075
5791029,5,B00DCRE9LY,"First of all it should be said that this film is a work of fiction. It's shot like a documentary, interviews, juxtaposition, news clips, etc. but later goes into a 'found footage' style in the third act to great effect.  The movie is about these two filmmakers trailing this wild eyed, unhinged looking conspiracy theorist, essentially the corporate media's stereotyped model for what they believe all conspiracy theorists look like.
The two main characters follow him around and film him at various outings as she rants and raves his ideas through a bullhorn, ala Alex Jones, and suddenly, one day, the guy just disappears.  His apartment is empty but for shreds of his multitudes of news clippings lying around. This is where the movie gets really interesting.
The fascinating thing about this movie is that while the plot is fictional, much of the information presented in the film is not. Secret societies, false flag events and other appalling acts of clandestine government operations are very much historical fact, though presented in a way that many of the 'uninitiated' may feel comfortable with.
All in all it's tense thriller grounded in plausibility and by the end you'll be scratching your head saying ""wtf just happened?""  Definitely a film for the paranoid or straight laced thrill seeker.",1400457600,,1304,5.055813953488372

Seems like lately any film that includes someone video recording something is classified found footage. The documentary makers were very believable and the film conveyed that peeping tom quality, where you feel like you are watching someone's life. The main conflict occurs near the end, though there are some tense scenes prior to it. The beginning leading to the middle is more storytelling and setting up for the big finale. The ending paid off. I can imagine this one with Eurohorror influenced surrealist imagery and camerwork if it had a bigger budget and that would've really rocked.

The movie centers around a few guys looking into a conspiracy theory about an exclusive (and fictional) club called the Tarsus club.  This club is only for the elite and is supposedly where the elite and powerful meet to discuss and plan major world events that take place.  This movie is by no means a blockbuster, but if you're bored one night and are looking something different to watch, I recommend this movie.  They makers did a great job of making it feel like an authentic documentary.  As corny as it sounds, they even made websites and Wikipedia pages to make it seem more real (although I believe that most or all of the wikipedia pages have now been removed).",1396051200,,800,4.482758620689655

The story follows two ""film makers"", Jim & Aaron, who are enthralled by a local conspiracy theorist Terrance G. (think Alex Jones crossed with The Dude) who has tied world events; like the sinking of the Lusitania, the JFK assassination, and the 9-11 attacks, to a shadowy Illuminati type group. It's all fun and ""very interesting"" to the film makers until one day Terrance disappears and Aaron decides to take up his research. Aaron eventually uncovers the Tarsus Club, and tries to infiltrate their yearly gathering (think Bohemian Grove minus the old guy on old guy sexy time) with less than pleasant results.

5791036,4,B00DCRE9LY,"Honestly I was hoping for meat when I received cake.  This ""documentary"" was more for entertainment.  My opinion is that this movie was created to suggest that seeking the truth is dangerous, those who seek truth are unbalanced and nave.  It also suggests that the more you discover truth, the more psychotic you become.  I absolutely disagree with this.  Truth does NOT make a person unbalanced or crazy and naivet&eacute; is NOT the motivation for such pursuits.  Manipulation and lies, however, can make a person very unbalanced.

I haven't done any research on what was presented in this movie, I'm not sure how much of the information presented is credible.

It was amusing to me when they blurred out Mark's face and distorted his voice, but then they zoomed in on a very identifying feature of his, his crooked fingers.  What was it that he said?  That it is in these secret societies interest to get some information out to the public about their existence.  I believe there is truth in that.  Like the Alex Jones documentary of Bohemian Grove, there was a point in that documentary where security caught Alex filming and yet he was allowed to remain there.  Even though filming is a VERY strict rule of theirs, a rule that is respected by all who attend.  Alex broke that rule and was caught and it was no big deal to the security there?  Yea, right, I'm not sure if I buy that.

""The Conspiracy"" movie served its purpose for entertainment.  I believe that this movie is good for entertainment only.  In my opinion, it is not a serious source of information or a serious presentation of reality.",1393027200,,1604,4.667857142857143

5791043,1,B00DCRE9LY,"This was the worst thing that I ever saw on film.
It made no sense and bored me silly as I waited for something to explain what it was about.
Finally, during the last few minutes the movie presented a lame explanation
in scenes that were obviously contrived to help finish the film.

AND....even with that they still needed some wizened senior citizen to verbally explain it on camera.
This is my second attempt to review it.
My first was rejected because I referred to this detritus with a three letter abbreviation.
What do they expect when you've wasted $3.99?",1384300800,2,563,4.63
5791044,4,B00DCRE9LY,"While small in budget, _The Conspiracy_ delivers a massive hit in suspense. I would label this a fauxmentary rather than a mockumentary since it is solid/serious in its execution which it does well. It's hard to discuss so as not to spoil the effect of the movie, but this is a ride worth taking. _The Conspiracy_draws from a wide range of sources to put together a coherent and spooky whole and leaves plenty of room for the viewer to make connections and question (which does the nifty trick of involving the viewer in the conspiracy research themselves.) It's a good, solid piece of entertainment, fun filmmaking and I look forward to seeing more from the director. If this is the future of low-budget spooky, bring it on.

(Likewise, if Anyone Important is reading this, the conspiracy would do well to invest in funding new Canadian suspense/horror films while they get all that world domination stuff in play. Just a suggestion.)",1384300800,,935,4.84375

5791046,4,B00DCRE9LY,"A little stressful to watch, not for a relaxing or romantic evening.  The play between the actors was better than most of these kinds of flicks. The characters were nicely developed for the time frame given.  I found it a little too close to truth for my comfort zone in wanting something relaxing or informational.",1380758400,3,315,4.709090909090909
5791047,1,B00DCRE9LY,"interesting idea, tight scripting, and clever uses of real world information make this film solid. but frankly, there was no flavor. I get that it was horrible on an intellectual level, ""oh, how terrible human beings can be!"" In reality I was bored half way through, and took a 25 minute nap right when I should've been on the edge of my seat. Amazon also loses points for putting this in the horror genre, when it hardly qualifies as horror.",1379635200,5,442,4.5375
5791048,4,B00DCRE9LY,"A very intense and powerful film. I honestly didn't know if it was real or fiction for the majority of the movie. It was THAT realistic. The acting is great, the story is great, and the ending is...well you'll have to see. All in all a great ""conspiracy nut"" movie that actually parallels a LOT of what is going on in the world today. I definitely will be watching this again.",1379376000,2,376,4.309859154929577
5791049,4,B00DCRE9LY,"A few, quick points:

- This is one of those movies that lingered on the brain for a few days after viewing. It causes one to consider the movie's conspiracy message as well as to think back on the strategically-placed clues that led to a surprising yet, in hindsight, inevitable climax and conclusion.
- One particularly smart element is in the film's second act where the plot appears to devolve into the land of the grossly unrealistic and downright silly. We actually stopped the movie at that point to complain to each other about the characters' nave actions and how, after a strong first act, the movie appeared to be taking a turn for the worse in its second. Boy did we end up being wrong. I like movies with twists and turns, particularly when they are intelligently executed and are wholly unexpected without being absurd. The Conspiracy perfectly delivers on the intelligent/unexpected/appropriate plot twist trick.
- A scene toward the end of the movie where the big reveal happens and the viewer begins to see how the puzzle pieces fit together is a particularly creepy one. I happen to enjoy suspense and horror movies somewhat regularly yet the scene in question genuinely gave me the shivers even after the movie had reached its conclusion.
- Similar to reviewers Ace and Cidney, I am not a huge fan of mockumentaries but The Conspiracy is an example of the genre done well.
- I generally reserve 5 star reviews for movies that have sewn up all of their plot holes or adequately explained all main characters' motivations. The Conspiracy does, in its second act, leave one wondering about the 2 main characters' motivations but this didn't detract too terribly from the viewing experience. The directing, acting, pacing, story, and cinematography are quite good.

Ultimately, it is an enjoyable viewing experience and a film with which its crew and actors should be proud to be associated.",1378512000,9,1906,4.87962962962963
5791050,4,B00DCRE9LY,"However, it doesn't let you know who the real life culprits are..

. I can understand why of course, because if it did, it wouldn't see the light of day as far as being publicized goes.

 Even so, I don't see how they even got it aired as it is.

 It's one of those movies you need to see to get any benefit out of the message it carries.

 So... I guess that's a 4 star recommendation.",1378252800,,386,3.935064935064935
5791051,4,B00DCRE9LY,"While this movie was cheap, cheesy and predictable, I still found it entertaining. It missed the mark in many ways, but it hit a bulls eye on some of the cool  documentary-like scenes when the two young film makers crashed a retreat from the elite one-world ruling class.

I liked the betrayal -- you have to watch to understand.  All in all, it was worth a look.",1378252800,7,363,4.388059701492537

8591942,4,B00DCRE9LY,"A wonderful film that breathes new life into the found footage genre!  What a joy it was to find this film, a pseudo-documentary about a conspiracy theorist that evolves into the unveiling of the ultimate conspiracy.  Two filmmakers follow a well-known conspiracy theorist and eventually become drawn into his nightmarish political theories.  To say more would ruin the viewing experience.

What is perhaps most remarkable about this film is that it manages to both be an examination of how compelling conspiracy feelings can be in our ""alternative facts"" times, but also create a true sense of dread and terror.  At times, I was literally on the edge of my seat in this film.  I highly recommend this!",1499904000,,702,4.957264957264957

Obviously the references here are Bohemian Grove and/or Bilderberg Group and the suggestion there is something sinister about both. If you can keep your disbelief at bay (something you generally have to do with all horror films), this is a good, popcorn movie. If if you're an actual conspiracy theorist, you'll probably find this film especially frightening.",1493510400,,530,5.397590361445783
