A feast for the eye's and ears. Almost as good as going to the actual show without having to worry about getting wet or having a stick cam shoved in your mouth.

On the Blu Ray version, be sure to go into Setup from the main menu. There is an uncompressed 5.1 PCM audio option. It's only listed as English 5.1 on the cover.",1225843200,17,541,6.012987012987013

3170112,5,B0017CW5J4,Just as good or even better than the live show!  I bought this as a gift for my son's birthday just after we saw the BMG in person.  We've had the DVD for years and LOVE it!,1417392000,,173,3.6486486486486487
3170113,3,B0017CW5J4,"This is primarily a review of this album, with some thoughts on the group as well. I have seen them perform live, so I can accurately say that the DVD does only a modest job of capturing the concert experience. There seems to be an ever so slight delay between sight and sound, visible when one of the three uses the piano strings as a ""gong"". Part of the visuals on the DVD may be due to the lighting which seems to be designed to highlight the three blue heads, and put most other things in shadow, except when a spot hits a performer.

I bought it primarily to get their rendition of Pete Townshend's ""Baba O'Reilly"", but the more I watch it, the less enamored I become. Their performance is based on two typical BMG novelties, the huge wearable percussion instruments made from PVC and flexible tubing, and the open piano strings. Once you are past that initial surprise, the rest is relatively ordinary. The female vocalist was ""nice"", but she could not match Roger Daltrey's performance of the lyrics. (Daltrey may be a caricature of a Rock and Roll vocalist, but he's got a powerful, distinctive voice.

The remainder of the cuts all seem to be more of the same. When you have seven percussionists, your range is rather limited. (The band was introduced with 2 drummers, on performer on ""drum kit"", a percussionist, plus the three blue men themselves. And with all that, one person, Keith Moon, could do just as well.

The biggest attraction is less in the music than it is with the business between the cuts, dealing with the theme of how to be a megastar.",1412812800,,1564,4.539007092198582

Some of their songs are the same, but executed differently, so it was worth buying both.  I liked the music in the Complex Rock a bit more than this one, but this one had better content.  For about $20 you can buy both and have some options.  Fun to have on the TV in the back ground for a party, or kids, or adults.  Recommend.",1389744000,,441,3.8444444444444446

3170176,2,B0017CW5J4,"The ""Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live"" on DVD is a much better concert than ""Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live!""
 a good example of this is the song I Feel Love in this DVD it is sung by Adrian Hartley and it doesn't even come close to the performance of Venus Hum/Annet Strean singing I feel Love in the ""Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live"".",1333497600,,370,3.933333333333333
3170177,3,B0017CW5J4,"The Complex Tour DVD is a much better concert than this release.  But the Complex is not Blueray and it plays on a smaller screen than my large flat screen.  So I bought this one, hoping it would be AT LEAST AS GOOD in High Def.  It is not, you will miss Venus Hum.

A good point is that there are many interesting extras.  Overall, I found the main program a bit boring.  I guess I'm finally getting over the Blue Man Group.  Seen them 3x.",1323561600,,440,4.046511627906977

3170180,5,B0017CW5J4,"The Blue Man Group epitomizes entertainment.  From their opening salvo to the final restrain of the last song, this disc shows exactly how entertaining the band can be.  Their unique approach to playing, combined with their slightly twisted humor, draws the viewer in and captivates them.  While this IS an extension of the act started during the Complex Tour, this disc is much more than just a rehash with a few new songs thrown in.

By the time the show ends, you too will know how to be a megastar.

But the real enjoyment of having the Blu-Ray disc is in the extras.  There you get to meet the guys who started it all, hear them explain how they approached their unique creative process and how they strive to be more than just an entertaining act.  Each of their shows is an experience, and this disc spills the beans on how it is all done.  There are several videos in the extras that enhance owning the disc even further.

You'll never believe that grown men in weird costumes, beating on some plastic pipes while catching marshmallows thrown from incredible distances and then spewing paint onto a canvas could be so entertaining, but start to finish this disc is filled with one pleasure stacked upon another.

This disc, just 1 among the hundreds of performing art discs that I own, is by far my most favorite and the most entertaining.  I can, and do, watch this one over and over and over.  You will to.",1284076800,4,1416,4.531496062992126
3170201,5,B0017CW5J4,"I have this DVD and like it a lot. I bought a blu-ray for best quality.
There is nobody who does not like because it's fun.

3170202,5,B0017CW5J4,"If you liked the first DVD, you'll love this one, with its addition of the little theater pieces they've adapted from their city shows.  The female singer here is just as good as Tracy Bonham was, though the cute girl with the incredible voice from Venus Hum is definitely missed.  I was excited to see Pink Floyd's ""One Of These Days"" included here, as the performance of this song at a live show blew me away.

If you haven't seen the first DVD, or seen Blue Man Group live, and especially if you like percussion, this DVD/Blu-ray is worth the purchase price.  Just note, the DVD contains an audio CD of the performance, while the Blu-ray does not.  Rhino's website was very unclear on this, and they refused to remedy the situation other than to offer me a refund.  I didn't want a refund, I wanted the CD I expected.  Bad, bad marketing company, excellent DVD/Blu-ray.",1266796800,,872,4.551282051282051
3170203,3,B0017CW5J4,"First off, this Blu Ray looks and sounds great.  Likewise, it contains exactly what it advertises- the touring, ""Megastar Live"" Blue Man Group show.  The extras alone are worth the price of this disc.

Where I was very disappointed is that in translating Blue Man Group from the 'installed' shows in small theaters to a touring production for a large-capacity stadium, much of the comedy, charm, and excitement has been lost from the original.  The result is a perfectly cromulent movie of a (fairly generic) rock concert performance, with about 15 minutes of really good Blue Man Group material scattered in.

If you haven't seen Blue Man Group live in one of the cities where it plays all the time, you may not know what I'm talking about.  But if you have seen Blue Man Group in NY, Chicago, Vegas, etc, be aware that this concert tour is a completely different show, with very little of the physical comedy and props, and almost exclusively BMG as accompaniment to a very large rock band complete with vocalists.  With the exception of 2-3 tracks, the music is much different and (IMO) not nearly as good.  If, like me, you are looking to relive that show: look elsewhere.",1265241600,,1176,4.702439024390244
3170204,3,B0017CW5J4,"It's OK.  Not as good as I had hoped. I have seen other videos of Blueman, and they where better.
It was of other live concerts.  Not enough pounding, to much talking, and some real bad singing.",1264550400,,194,4.216216216216216
3170205,3,B0017CW5J4,"I might give it a 5 star review if I had purchased the DVD version.  The trouble is that I bought the Blu-ray version and its video quality is way below my expectation from a Blu-ray disc.  I wouldn't use it to demo my big screen TV.  Perhaps there are too much strob light flashings on stage and the HD compression couldn't keep up with the rapid picture changes, the video quality is not good at all.  I actually doubt if the concert was shot with HD cameras.

The concert itself is okay.  However, since I already have their Complex Rock Tour DVD, this concert is like 75% repeat of what I have seen on the other DVD.  If I had watched this disc at my friends' place, I wouldn't order my own copy.

However, if you like Blue Man Group and you don't already have their complex rock tour DVD, then it is a more up-to-date version of the concert.",1260921600,,846,4.211180124223603
3170206,5,B0017CW5J4,Excellent musicians!  This video was entertaining from the beginning to end.  This band is so unique; I've never seen anything quite like it before.,1258588800,,148,5.125
3170207,4,B0017CW5J4,"I saw Blue Man at their flagship Astor Theater in NYC several years ago, and anyone who's been there knows what a tiny and intimate setting it is (and often messy!). The theater seats less than 150 people and you really see the Blue Men up close. This Blu-ray features a totally different experience, filmed at American Airlines Centre in Dallas (2007) in front of a crowd of 40,000 fans. The aerial shots really show off how massive the venue is, and ""How to Be a Megastar Live!"" feels more like a large stadium rock concert than a quintessential Blue Man performance.

As such, there are a lot of things the Blue Men can't do, so many of their trademark audience participation schticks, physical humor, and signature weirdness are missing. Instead, this tour relies heavily on traditional rock venue fare like big flashy lights (and light suits), percussion, rock music, and singing (featuring a male and a female vocalist). In their theater shows, the band members are off in the background and play a supporting role, but here, they often take center stage and perhaps too often. I would say the Blue Men are only the center of attention for about half of the time. They only do one physical performance skit (marshmallow catching).

The performances are framed around an instructional ""how to be a rock star"" video that the Blue Men order from ""Rod Popeil"" (Ron Popeil's supposed brother) at the beginning of the show. A voiceover narrates dubious instructions and invites audience participation while graphics appear on the jumbotron. The narrator is wildly wrong at times for comic effect, as you might expect, since humor is a large part of the Blue Man act. The musical segments are very solid, with the most memorable performance for me being a howling guitar rendition of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-of-These-Days/dp/B000002U8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One of These Days</a>"" (Pink Floyd) and Blue Man's own version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Who-s/dp/B000065UFD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Who's</a>&nbsp;Baba O'Riley, which both come near the end of the show.

Extras are a bit thin (all standard definition): ""Mono Makes a Plea"", an unfunny 3 minute parody of Bono and the Edge (""Side"") with a 5 minute Blue Man skit at the end; an informative and entertaining 39 minute documentary called ""Inside the Tube"" with founders Phil Stanton, Chris Wink, and Matt Goldman; and a self-described ""typical music video"" called ""I Feel Love"". ""Mono"" is totally skippable, but don't miss the documentary. The three men talk about their inspirations and philosophy over a lot of funny footage from their theater acts. They explain that BMG is essentially a ""variety show"" in the tradition of vaudeville, and shed a lot of insight into the creative process and evolution of the franchise. You'll see a lot of their famous skits and it's definitely worth watching. Lastly, subtitles include: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese.

If you have the chance -- and the budget ($75/ticket in NY) -- to attend a live Blue Man show, don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy this unique experience. But if not, this Blu-ray is the next best option. Though it doesn't show off the Blue Men doing their comedy bits, Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live! is still fun for BMG fans, music lovers, and newcomers alike. It suitable for viewers of all ages.

4.5/5 stars.",1257724800,,3495,5.2450805008944545

3170210,5,B0017CW5J4,"Blue Man Group's How to Be a Megastar Live! is great fun in so many ways.  The content is humorous at times and thought-provoking in others.  The music is great as well, blending almost native tone pieces with hard rock and inspiring vocals.  The visual performance ensures your eyes rarely leave the screen.

The sound and visual quality of the recording are stellar.  Deep bass and LFE is almost always present due to the highly percussive nature of the performances, while the rest of the guitars and vocals are extremely clear and precise.  Surround imaging is well steered.  The surround and surround back channels are active and enveloping without being overused.  The most impressive part of this transfer is the great use of dynamic range.  Spoken and non-musical parts of the performance are at appropriately comfortable levels, but when the music picks up so does the SPL.  This may wreak havoc on people listening through tiny TV speakers, but will be greatly appreciated by anyone with a quality HT system.",1254096000,2,1018,4.935294117647059

Although nothing compares to seeing them in person (which I've done twice) the Blu-ray release comes as close as you can possibly get. The HD quality is incredible, but what makes this so great is the amazing sound quality! If you buy this, make sure you set it to 5.1 surround sound in the setup menu. For some reason, the default sound setting is stereo, which is awful if you're listening to it on a surround sound system.

Once you set it to 5.1, the sound will blow you away! The only thing I found to be odd about the show is the fact that there was singing during quite a few parts. The Blue Man Group typically only has acoustic songs, so the vocal work is unusual, but still good and fitting.

Overall, if you have a Blu-ray player this is a necessity! I strongly recommend it!",1242864000,,938,4.258426966292135
3170236,5,B0017CW5J4,"I've been to the Orlando BMG show twice, and decided to take a look at what they had on video.  I bought the Complex Rock Tour on DVD and How To Be A Megastar on Blu-Ray.

The song lists are similar, but there are many differences in the two.

The Complex Rock Tour doesn't have the vaudeville shtick the BMG is famous for, and at times the artifacting and pixalization on my 46"" was almost unwatchable.  The 5.1 mix also doesn't come close to the Blu-Ray's uncompressed PCM.

How To Be A Megastar Live! is more of a complete BMG show, complete with paintballs and marshmallows.  The picture is crystal clear (at least it is on Blu), and the visuals are outstanding.  The sound booms out like you were almost there.  But not quite... :-)

The Inside The Tube documentary (and Mono) has excerpts of the comedy routines that aren't in the main video, or didn't fit into the tour itself.  It is almost worth the price of the disc itself.  It's also interesting to note that there are a couple of clips from the Orlando show, but Orlando is never given a mention.

And so, I'm givin' it 5 stars.  I find myself playing the disc like it was a CD, just to have the music in the background.  The music is outstanding.

3170254,2,B0017CW5J4,"This is one of the first blu-ray titles that I purchased.  It was high on my list because I loved ""The Complex Rock Tour"" on DVD, but the video quality on that DVD was terrible.

The video quality on this ""Megastar"" blu-ray disk is good, but in every other aspect the ""The Complex Rock Tour"" is superior to ""Megastar"".

Bottom line:  the ""Megastar"" concert is disappointing.  The blue men themselves seem to be just going through the motions, the audience often seems bored, the sound quality is muddled, and the attempt to use ""infomercials"" during segues is almost embarrassing to watch.  Pondering what went wrong, it seems that the focus has shifted to everything other than the 3 blue men, to the point that the title characters seem to be an afterthought.  If the theme of ""The Complex"" was ""watch these quirky guys make amazing music on odd instruments"", the theme of ""Megastar"" is ""listen to this backup band, with some disinterested guys dressed up in blue added for free.""

About half way through ""Megastar"" the song ""I Feel Love"" is performed.  This was a highlight of ""The Complex"", featuring Annette Strean of Venus Hum in the electrified dress.  I have to give ""Megastar"" credit for boldness in its attempt to perform this song without Annette Strean, but unfortunately the attempt succeeded mainly in illustrating how lame ""Megastar"" is compared to ""The Complex.""

3170257,5,B0017CW5J4,"I saw the Blue Man Group live in Boston several years ago, and have been a fan since they first started getting noticed.  Their anti-style drew me in, their messages tickled me, their visuals enthralled me, but their music kept me.

So you can imagine my joy a couple years ago when I saw that HDnet was going to show this concert in HiDef.  I blocked out the time on that Sunday, turned on my cable, and was prepared to be enthralled.

I was horribly disappointed.  I literally called my cable provider and complained.

The problem was not with the content, but rather with the highly compressed delivery system.  The strobes and fire in ""One of These Days"", the rapid motion of the drum sticks and whips in ""Shadows Part 2"", the paint drums in ""Your Attention"", the confetti and full-stage views in ""Baba O'Riley"", all pushed way past the limits of any kind of a cable TV, satellite delivery, or HD video download service.  Macroblocking in the rapid strobe scenes and the paint drops (which wound up looking like large squares rather than droplets) made the video look like an early VHS tape rather than a 2 megapixel, 21st century, HiDef recording.

So, I've been just as eagerly anticipating this Blu-Ray release.  And this time, I've not been disappointed.  With data rates regularly exceeding 35Mbps in the high motion scenes, peaking at over 49Mbps for some of the most complex transitions in the climax of ""Baba O'Riley"", this disc exemplifies ""why Blu-Ray"".

Those who claim that HD downloads will replace physical media may be right someday, but that day is not here yet, it will not be here any time soon, and this disc shows why.

This Blu-Ray was superbly crafted, with the quality of audio and video paramount.  It's a worthy addition to your collection, and when a friend wants to see how well Blu-Ray can handle difficult material, pull this one out.  If you're (un)lucky enough to have HDnet Sunday Concerts showing this concert on cable or satellite at the same time, you'll easily be able to see what I'm talking about, and convincingly demonstrate it.

If you like Blue Man Group and don't yet have a Hi Def display and Blu-Ray player, this is a great reason to finally make the jump.

Kudos to HDnet for recording this, and props to Blink Digital for the superb Blu-Ray production!",1231632000,6,2303,4.689054726368159

3404610,3,B0017CW5J4,"This is primarily a review of this album, with some thoughts on the group as well. I have seen them perform live, so I can accurately say that the DVD does only a modest job of capturing the concert experience. There seems to be an ever so slight delay between sight and sound, visible when one of the three uses the piano strings as a ""gong"". Part of the visuals on the DVD may be due to the lighting which seems to be designed to highlight the three blue heads, and put most other things in shadow, except when a spot hits a performer.

I bought it primarily to get their rendition of Pete Townshend's ""Baba O'Reilly"", but the more I watch it, the less enamored I become. Their performance is based on two typical BMG novelties, the huge wearable percussion instruments made from PVC and flexible tubing, and the open piano strings. Once you are past that initial surprise, the rest is relatively ordinary. The female vocalist was ""nice"", but she could not match Roger Daltrey's performance of the lyrics. (Daltrey may be a caricature of a Rock and Roll vocalist, but he's got a powerful, distinctive voice.

The remainder of the cuts all seem to be more of the same. When you have seven percussionists, your range is rather limited. (The band was introduced with 2 drummers, on performer on ""drum kit"", a percussionist, plus the three blue men themselves. And with all that, one person, Keith Moon, could do just as well.

The biggest attraction is less in the music than it is with the business between the cuts, dealing with the theme of how to be a megastar.",1412812800,,1564,4.539007092198582

3404677,5,B0017CW5J4,"The Blue Man Group epitomizes entertainment.  From their opening salvo to the final restrain of the last song, this disc shows exactly how entertaining the band can be.  Their unique approach to playing, combined with their slightly twisted humor, draws the viewer in and captivates them.  While this IS an extension of the act started during the Complex Tour, this disc is much more than just a rehash with a few new songs thrown in.

By the time the show ends, you too will know how to be a megastar.

But the real enjoyment of having the Blu-Ray disc is in the extras.  There you get to meet the guys who started it all, hear them explain how they approached their unique creative process and how they strive to be more than just an entertaining act.  Each of their shows is an experience, and this disc spills the beans on how it is all done.  There are several videos in the extras that enhance owning the disc even further.

You'll never believe that grown men in weird costumes, beating on some plastic pipes while catching marshmallows thrown from incredible distances and then spewing paint onto a canvas could be so entertaining, but start to finish this disc is filled with one pleasure stacked upon another.

I was excited to see Pink Floyd's ""One Of These Days"" included here, as the performance of this song at a live show blew me away.

If you haven't seen the first DVD, or seen Blue Man Group live, and especially if you like percussion, this DVD/Blu-ray is worth the purchase price.  Just note, the DVD contains an audio CD of the performance, while the Blu-ray does not.

3404700,3,B0017CW5J4,"First off, this Blu Ray looks and sounds great.  Likewise, it contains exactly what it advertises- the touring, ""Megastar Live"" Blue Man Group show.  The extras alone are worth the price of this disc.

Where I was very disappointed is that in translating Blue Man Group from the 'installed' shows in small theaters to a touring production for a large-capacity stadium, much of the comedy, charm, and excitement has been lost from the original.  The result is a perfectly cromulent movie of a (fairly generic) rock concert performance, with about 15 minutes of really good Blue Man Group material scattered in.

If you haven't seen Blue Man Group live in one of the cities where it plays all the time, you may not know what I'm talking about.  But if you have seen Blue Man Group in NY, Chicago, Vegas, etc, be aware that this concert tour is a completely different show, with very little of the physical comedy and props, and almost exclusively BMG as accompaniment to a very large rock band complete with vocalists.  With the exception of 2-3 tracks, the music is much different and (IMO) not nearly as good.  If, like me, you are looking to relive that show: look elsewhere.",1265241600,,1176,4.702439024390244

Perhaps there are too much strob light flashings on stage and the HD compression couldn't keep up with the rapid picture changes, the video quality is not good at all.  I actually doubt if the concert was shot with HD cameras.

The concert itself is okay.  However, since I already have their Complex Rock Tour DVD, this concert is like 75% repeat of what I have seen on the other DVD.  If I had watched this disc at my friends' place, I wouldn't order my own copy.

3404704,4,B0017CW5J4,"I saw Blue Man at their flagship Astor Theater in NYC several years ago, and anyone who's been there knows what a tiny and intimate setting it is (and often messy!). The theater seats less than 150 people and you really see the Blue Men up close. This Blu-ray features a totally different experience, filmed at American Airlines Centre in Dallas (2007) in front of a crowd of 40,000 fans. The aerial shots really show off how massive the venue is, and ""How to Be a Megastar Live!"" feels more like a large stadium rock concert than a quintessential Blue Man performance.

As such, there are a lot of things the Blue Men can't do, so many of their trademark audience participation schticks, physical humor, and signature weirdness are missing. Instead, this tour relies heavily on traditional rock venue fare like big flashy lights (and light suits), percussion, rock music, and singing (featuring a male and a female vocalist). In their theater shows, the band members are off in the background and play a supporting role, but here, they often take center stage and perhaps too often. I would say the Blue Men are only the center of attention for about half of the time. They only do one physical performance skit (marshmallow catching).

The performances are framed around an instructional ""how to be a rock star"" video that the Blue Men order from ""Rod Popeil"" (Ron Popeil's supposed brother) at the beginning of the show. A voiceover narrates dubious instructions and invites audience participation while graphics appear on the jumbotron. The narrator is wildly wrong at times for comic effect, as you might expect, since humor is a large part of the Blue Man act. The musical segments are very solid, with the most memorable performance for me being a howling guitar rendition of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-of-These-Days/dp/B000002U8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One of These Days</a>"" (Pink Floyd) and Blue Man's own version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Who-s/dp/B000065UFD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Who's</a>&nbsp;Baba O'Riley, which both come near the end of the show.

Extras are a bit thin (all standard definition): ""Mono Makes a Plea"", an unfunny 3 minute parody of Bono and the Edge (""Side"") with a 5 minute Blue Man skit at the end; an informative and entertaining 39 minute documentary called ""Inside the Tube"" with founders Phil Stanton, Chris Wink, and Matt Goldman; and a self-described ""typical music video"" called ""I Feel Love"". ""Mono"" is totally skippable, but don't miss the documentary. The three men talk about their inspirations and philosophy over a lot of funny footage from their theater acts. They explain that BMG is essentially a ""variety show"" in the tradition of vaudeville, and shed a lot of insight into the creative process and evolution of the franchise. You'll see a lot of their famous skits and it's definitely worth watching. Lastly, subtitles include: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese.

If you have the chance -- and the budget ($75/ticket in NY) -- to attend a live Blue Man show, don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy this unique experience. But if not, this Blu-ray is the next best option. Though it doesn't show off the Blue Men doing their comedy bits, Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live! is still fun for BMG fans, music lovers, and newcomers alike. It suitable for viewers of all ages.

The music is great as well, blending almost native tone pieces with hard rock and inspiring vocals.  The visual performance ensures your eyes rarely leave the screen.

The sound and visual quality of the recording are stellar.  Deep bass and LFE is almost always present due to the highly percussive nature of the performances, while the rest of the guitars and vocals are extremely clear and precise.  Surround imaging is well steered.  The surround and surround back channels are active and enveloping without being overused.  The most impressive part of this transfer is the great use of dynamic range.  Spoken and non-musical parts of the performance are at appropriately comfortable levels, but when the music picks up so does the SPL.

Although nothing compares to seeing them in person (which I've done twice) the Blu-ray release comes as close as you can possibly get. The HD quality is incredible, but what makes this so great is the amazing sound quality! If you buy this, make sure you set it to 5.1 surround sound in the setup menu. For some reason, the default sound setting is stereo, which is awful if you're listening to it on a surround sound system.

Once you set it to 5.1, the sound will blow you away! The only thing I found to be odd about the show is the fact that there was singing during quite a few parts. The Blue Man Group typically only has acoustic songs, so the vocal work is unusual, but still good and fitting.

The song lists are similar, but there are many differences in the two.

The Complex Rock Tour doesn't have the vaudeville shtick the BMG is famous for, and at times the artifacting and pixalization on my 46"" was almost unwatchable.  The 5.1 mix also doesn't come close to the Blu-Ray's uncompressed PCM.

How To Be A Megastar Live! is more of a complete BMG show, complete with paintballs and marshmallows.  The picture is crystal clear (at least it is on Blu), and the visuals are outstanding.  The sound booms out like you were almost there.  But not quite... :-)

The Inside The Tube documentary (and Mono) has excerpts of the comedy routines that aren't in the main video, or didn't fit into the tour itself.  It is almost worth the price of the disc itself.  It's also interesting to note that there are a couple of clips from the Orlando show, but Orlando is never given a mention.

And so, I'm givin' it 5 stars.  I find myself playing the disc like it was a CD, just to have the music in the background.  The music is outstanding.

When we saw this Blu-Ray at Amazon for less than $12, we couldn't resist.  It's fun to watch and definitely worth the money.  Of course it can't beat seeing BMG live, but hey, it's a lot cheaper this way!",1235088000,,317,4.163934426229508

3404751,2,B0017CW5J4,"This is one of the first blu-ray titles that I purchased.  It was high on my list because I loved ""The Complex Rock Tour"" on DVD, but the video quality on that DVD was terrible.

The video quality on this ""Megastar"" blu-ray disk is good, but in every other aspect the ""The Complex Rock Tour"" is superior to ""Megastar"".

Bottom line:  the ""Megastar"" concert is disappointing.  The blue men themselves seem to be just going through the motions, the audience often seems bored, the sound quality is muddled, and the attempt to use ""infomercials"" during segues is almost embarrassing to watch.  Pondering what went wrong, it seems that the focus has shifted to everything other than the 3 blue men, to the point that the title characters seem to be an afterthought.  If the theme of ""The Complex"" was ""watch these quirky guys make amazing music on odd instruments"", the theme of ""Megastar"" is ""listen to this backup band, with some disinterested guys dressed up in blue added for free.""

About half way through ""Megastar"" the song ""I Feel Love"" is performed.  This was a highlight of ""The Complex"", featuring Annette Strean of Venus Hum in the electrified dress.  I have to give ""Megastar"" credit for boldness in its attempt to perform this song without Annette Strean, but unfortunately the attempt succeeded mainly in illustrating how lame ""Megastar"" is compared to ""The Complex.""

As another reviewer said, if you haven't seen ""The Complex"" you may like ""Megastar"", but if you have seen ""The Complex"" you will find ""Megastar"" uninspiring--it has no soul.",1233792000,17,1553,4.8893129770992365

3404754,5,B0017CW5J4,"I saw the Blue Man Group live in Boston several years ago, and have been a fan since they first started getting noticed.  Their anti-style drew me in, their messages tickled me, their visuals enthralled me, but their music kept me.

So you can imagine my joy a couple years ago when I saw that HDnet was going to show this concert in HiDef.  I blocked out the time on that Sunday, turned on my cable, and was prepared to be enthralled.

I was horribly disappointed.  I literally called my cable provider and complained.

The problem was not with the content, but rather with the highly compressed delivery system.  The strobes and fire in ""One of These Days"", the rapid motion of the drum sticks and whips in ""Shadows Part 2"", the paint drums in ""Your Attention"", the confetti and full-stage views in ""Baba O'Riley"", all pushed way past the limits of any kind of a cable TV, satellite delivery, or HD video download service.  Macroblocking in the rapid strobe scenes and the paint drops (which wound up looking like large squares rather than droplets) made the video look like an early VHS tape rather than a 2 megapixel, 21st century, HiDef recording.

So, I've been just as eagerly anticipating this Blu-Ray release.  And this time, I've not been disappointed.  With data rates regularly exceeding 35Mbps in the high motion scenes, peaking at over 49Mbps for some of the most complex transitions in the climax of ""Baba O'Riley"", this disc exemplifies ""why Blu-Ray"".

Those who claim that HD downloads will replace physical media may be right someday, but that day is not here yet, it will not be here any time soon, and this disc shows why.

This Blu-Ray was superbly crafted, with the quality of audio and video paramount.  It's a worthy addition to your collection, and when a friend wants to see how well Blu-Ray can handle difficult material, pull this one out.  If you're (un)lucky enough to have HDnet Sunday Concerts showing this concert on cable or satellite at the same time, you'll easily be able to see what I'm talking about, and convincingly demonstrate it.

If you like Blue Man Group and don't yet have a Hi Def display and Blu-Ray player, this is a great reason to finally make the jump.

Kudos to HDnet for recording this, and props to Blink Digital for the superb Blu-Ray production!",1231632000,6,2303,4.689054726368159

3404756,4,B0017CW5J4,"Everything was amazing about the Blue Man Group Concert except for one qualm that I had. I don't think that the female vocalist is half as good sounding as Venus Hum was in the original complex tour. The Blue Man Group should have brought her back as a guest vocalist for at least the recording of this concert. Other than that little complaint, the Blu-Ray is amazing.",1230076800,,369,4.522388059701493

8265544,5,B0017CW5J4,"I really love the music and artistic percussion (not to mention the humor) of Blue Man Group, so naturally I'm going to give this video a 5-star review.  I realize the whole Blue Man Group experience is not everyone's cup of tea, so if you've never seen Blue Man Group live you may want to consider renting this video before you buy it.  You should also know that this video is NOT like seeing Blue Man Group live -- this video is based almost entirely around music, so you won't see any of the funny skits you would see at a live performance.  The basic theme of the Blu-Ray is three Blue guys that don't speak a single word learning about creating the ultimate rock concert experience, which incorporates some pretty funny moments and A LOT of great music.  So if you're up for a sight-and-sound experience that combines original songs and some well-known pop/rock covers, you're in for a real treat.  The Blu-Ray is far superior to the DVD (The Complex Rock Tour Live) in terms of sound and picture quality, and it has some interesting extras as well.  Blue Man Group fans should find this Blu-Ray thoroughly enjoyable, and it's also a great introduction to the Blue Man Group for those who have heard of them but have never seen them in action.",1444003200,3,1248,4.524444444444445
