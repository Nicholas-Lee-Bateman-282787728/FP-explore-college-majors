8042747,4,B0006SSOQ8,You can't go wrong with this combo pack.  Van Helsing is an interesting twist to the story of the famous Vampire Hunter with lots of action and a gathering of the famous Monsters of the past.  The Mummy with Brandan Fraiser is not you typical monster classic but lots of action and lots of funny scenes and lines throughout the movie.  You will want to watch these movies again and again.,1218240000,,388,4.436619718309859
