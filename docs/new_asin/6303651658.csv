704842,3,6303651658,"This little film is a mildly amusing fairy tale which encourages people to believe that all it takes is a little grit and determination they can blow the whistle on the crooked and jaded.  Despite the rather dull screenplay, Judy Holliday as the the girl holding the whistle, makes ""Cadillac"" quite watchable.  It's a subtle variation on her performance in Born Yesterday:  not an uneducated woman (if Billie Dawn was that dumb, how was she able to learn the things she did?), but rather a kind, naive young woman in the big corporate jungle who at first unwittingly and finally knowingly effects change in a company which has strayed from the ideals of its founder (Paul Douglas).  The film also features some welcome appearances by performers familiar to any film fan over forty:  John Williams (Audrey Hepburn's father in the original Sabrina and the insurance adjustor in To Catch a Thief), in an uncharacteristically unsympathetic turn, and in a smaller role, Richard Deacon, most famous for his role as Mel Cooley on the old Dick Van Dyke show.  It's a quaint time capsule of New York in the mid 1950's:  the attitudes towards women, the post-war optimism, the streetscapes, the lunch counter at Schrafft's, the big cars, the Jean Louis clothes.  All in all, the film equivalent of curling up on the sofa with a big duvet while eating your favourite comfort food.",1067299200,,1369,4.84549356223176
704843,5,6303651658,"Hollywood has had a long tradition of dumb blonde performers who could be counted on to produce more than their share of belly-laughs. None, however, was more expert at the trade than Judy Holiday whose untimely death robbed filmdom of one of its most accomplished comediennes. This movie, along with Born Yesterday, is among her very best, and should not be missed.
 Film fans may want to note that there's a direct line of descent from Holiday in this movie to Reese Witherspoon in the recent megahit Legally Blonde. Like Witherspoon's character in Blonde, everyone underestimates Holiday's Laura Partridge and with similarly devastating results. In both cases, it's that sweetly scatterbrained exterior that  conceals a shrewd and determined inner woman, a combination which proves deadly for those who would happily exploit them. Here, it's the Board of a soulless corporation ( just then emerging from the 50's decade of growth) that falls into Holiday's trap with hilarious results. The Board itself is a stellar lineup of character actors: from the curmudgeonly Fred Clark, to the cultured John Williams, to the scheming Ray Collins, all familiar faces from the Late Late Show and pompously perfect targets for a womanly comeuppance. Holiday's pixilated exchanges with these smugly officious scofflaws are minor gems.
Those interested in charting the rise of the women's movement might also note an important contrast between the two films. Holiday's character, for all her wiles and willpower, must eventually succumb in typical 50's fashion to her stronger male half as played by the always redoubtable Paul Douglas. On the other hand, Witherspoon's post-Gloria Steinam character discovers a hidden self-sufficiency that requires no Douglas counterpart, producing a typically 90's note of feminist triumph. But these are merely incidental reflections on an underrated movie that truly sparkles because of the comedic lustre of its star, the unforgettable Judy Holiday, in a role that suits her to the proverbial T.",1059350400,5,2023,5.3584905660377355

705203,5,6303651658,"One of Judy Holiday's best!

Judy Holiday was a spectacular comedic actor who died way too young.  She was great in many of her films, but usually was cast as a dumb blonde, a la her character in Born Yesterday, who only achieves anything with the help of a man.  This role is different -- which is why it is one of her best performances.

Her character is indeed portrayed as being a dumb blonde -- and the board of directors of a company whose stock she owns in a very small quantity figure to make her clam up about possible improprieties by appointing her is a stockholder liaison.  They get more than they bargained for when it turns out she isn't as dumb as they think.

Paul Douglas does his usual fine job as the hard-working, honest, but oblivious founder of the big company. He takes an appointment in Washington DC at $1 per year because he sees it as his patriotic duty.  Judy is sent to ""lobby"" him -- breaking the law, of course -- but she doesn't know it.  Then the fun begins.

This film from 1956 could have been made today -- based on more current events, corrupt business people, illegal lobbying, kickbacks.  You will be glad it wasn't, because if it was made today it would be a drama.  This is a fun comedy, fast-paced, with great performances right down to all the character actors -- something to be said for the old studio system -- it wasn't all bad.

You will probably recognize George Burns' voice as the narrator.

Give this one a try.  Not a dull moment.  Judy was great!",1431388800,,1501,4.368231046931408

705377,5,6303651658,"Watching The Solid Gold Cadillac(1956) is akin to eating a delicious bag of potato chips that you just cant put down. The early-style sitcom-like musical introduction, complete with zany looking credits, quickly assures us that there must be something worth sticking around for. There is. The pace is brisk but without the annoying rapid-fire editing often associated with contemporary films.

Avaricious businessmen in suits are ever present. As for Judy Holiday and Paul Douglas  well, how could they not work perfectly together? Their fluid rapport, developed from earlier stage associations, is practically instinctive. The film is populated by a smorgasbord of recognizable secondary players from days gone by: Stone faced Richard Deacon (The Dick Van Dyke Show / Leave it to Beavers Fred Rutherford), the obsequious Fred Clark (Sunset Boulevard / Auntie Mame), a compliant yes-man Ray Collins (Citizen Kane / Touch of Evil / Perry Mason TV series), the somewhat overconfident but nervous John Williams (Dial M for Murder / To Catch a Thief / Family Affair TV series) and various other savory (and not so savory) characters. You may also recognize the voice of George Burns doing some narrative work in this one.

Although corporate office settings may seem a bit dull, they come alive when filled with this time-tested cast of confused 1950s businessmen stereotypes. Corporate greed and ethics are under assault here by Laura Partridge (Judy Holiday) who owns a paltry 10-share certificate of International Projects Ltd. stock. This certificate, however, entitles her to attend the annual stockholders meeting and she does. Then, to the dismay of the board of directors, she begins asking questions - too many questions. The execs feel compelled to put a muzzle on her. They proceed to implement a plan to keep her quiet but fail to realize that ingenuity is a hidden component to Lauras naive dumb-blonde persona.

This is truly a timeless comedy classic with some heartwarming scenes. The writing is excellent, but don't expect to walk away with an arsenal of classic quotes. Filmed in black and white except for the last scene which appears in color. Highly recommended.",1364688000,2,2179,5.199430199430199

705478,5,6303651658,"This is the somewhat dark comedy predecessor to ""How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" in that both deal with corporate greed and bureaucracy with a satirical approach.  Holliday is masterful, as always, in her portrayal of a somewhat naive stockholder who is given a position with the company to shut her up--she ends up saving the day for the employees and stockholders by performing an end-run around the officers.  Certainly as entertaining, if not moreso, as her ""Bells Are Ringing"" with Dean Martin.  I loved it!",1184284800,3,530,5.0
705479,5,6303651658,"What can you say about Judy Holliday?  Her timing was always absolutely perfect.  Her facial expressions frequently making speech unnecessary.  In Solid Gold Cadillac she gives a magical portrayal of a supposedly, dumb blonde, part time actress with no appreciation of Shakespeare, (""You don't even get to sit down unless you're a king"" - a typical Holliday line) but who is nonetheless shrewd enough to see through the corrupt shenanigans of the board of directors of a multi-national company in which she owns ten shares.  The partnering of Judy Holliday with that fine actor, Paul Douglas, as Edward L. McKeever, the upright, down to earth and totally INCORRUPTIBLE founder of the company, who is ""scared of girls"", works like a dream.  The film also has excellent support from Ray Collins, Arthur O'Connell, Neva Patterson, John Williams and of course Fred Clark, as Snell, the oily, slippery, nasty piece of work company treasurer.  I defy anyone not to hiss whenever he appears.  In addition to being a lovely romantic comedy, this is also a tale of good fighting to overcome evil, and the little people of this world getting together and refusing to be trampled by a big faceless conglomerate.  If you've never seen this picture before, or maybe never seen a Judy Holliday movie, you're in for a treat.",1180569600,6,1309,4.945205479452055

The comedic range of Judy Holliday in this film is astonishing, and she is giftwrapped for viewers' full appreciation by period fashions of 1956.  There is an immediate smile as Holliday and Paul Douglas head for the lunch counter at Schrafts, Douglas is warned that a bridge toll will cost him twenty-five cents, and the steno pool uses the latest in Smith Corona typewriters.  The entire cast works well together with material that was naughty on Broadway half a century ago during the Eisenhower years, wringing the naughtiness out for us with subtly knowing leers.

Of particular interest to me was watching Ray Collins shortly before he immortalized Lt. Tragg on the b&w PERRY MASON and a dozen years after he played the political foil to Welles's Kane.  A member of the chorus of corrupt corporate execs, he has the fewest lines and least to contribute.

Judy Holliday (as ""Laura Partridge"") attends a stockholder's meeting.  The meeting goes by too routinely.  They almost neglect to see the waving hand of Miss Holliday.  Naturally being a stockholder herself, she has a question to ask, before they vote for Treasurer. She does ask some very simple, honest questions, but these white-collar showboats just can't give her an honest answer without the push-off or feeding their face.  Well, this smart blonde woman makes a motion and since she does own 10 shares, she would like to form a stockholders committee of her own to discuss the ""too big"" salaries of the showboats.  She does get involved and this woman will make some unselfish changes.  Watch the business and the fun begin.  The ending of the film changes to color.

705483,4,6303651658,"To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol!  That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on.  The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in ""Harvey"" and ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film.  One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie.  This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career).  But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman.  Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon!  (Note:  Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.)  This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy.  And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a ""dumb blonde""!  She only did that in ""Born Yesterday.""",1078876800,5,1398,4.359073359073359
705484,4,6303651658,"Although older film buffs remember her fondly, I suspect that Judy Holliday is not as familiar to classic cinema fans today as she should be. She was a beautiful, charming actress who sparkled in comedy roles. While her career took off in the late 40s, it was during the 50s that she made her most famous films, although the number of movies were relatively few. She was caught up in the communist witch-hunts of the 50s, which--to Hollywood's disgrace--had an impact on her film career, and the number of quality roles offered. She was not the only victim during those dark days. By the 60s, she was seriously ill, and succumbed to breast cancer, at age 44.
""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" gave Ms. Holliday one of her best roles. As a minor shareholder in a major company, her character asks some simple, but pointed questions at a stock-holders' meeting that lead to various complications for a very greedy, dishonest and unethical Board of Directors, played by John Williams ( smarmy and unscrupulous ), Fred Clark ( a two-faced bully ) and Ray Collins ( indignant and crooked ). She also becomes involved with the founder of the company, played by Paul Douglas, a decent man with too much integrity for those sharks on the Board. The whole cast is excellent, and the plot is consistently amusing.
I found the main theme of this film to be just as relevant today. We are living in an era of high-profile corporate scandal ( eg. Enron, Hollinger, the list goes on and on ). When these situations are investigated, what is found at the bottom ? Nothing but pure, unadulterated greed. The more things change, etc. Actually, I could see ""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" being updated today--technology has changed, the ""numbers"" are a lot bigger--but good old-fashioned greed is still around, big-time ! I could see one of our current actresses, with a flair for comedy, having a big hit with this ""remake"". I nominate Sandra Bullock--hey Sandy--you'd be terrific !
In the mean time, this is a delightful DVD--nice picture, mono sound, of course, and a fine souvenir of Judy Holliday--a star who shone too briefly, but very brightly.",1070236800,55,2120,4.779291553133515
