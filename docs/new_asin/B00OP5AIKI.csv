But by the end I found myself surprisingly emotional and caught up in the band's psychodrama- guys going through mid-life crises, while trying to hold onto a teenage spirit that fired them up when they started over 20 years earlier.

Making it all comically absurd is their creepy, nerdy therapist/coach who I guess succeeds at getting them through the record, but seems kind of a loony in his own right.

The film covers the whole 2 years of making the album `St. Anger', and it ends up being a pretty damn interesting look into the creative process of a group, the costs of fame and rock and roll, and the desire not to let one's artistic flame go out.

Not as good as it's close companion (and correlative opposite) documentary `Anvil'; these guys are less likable, and their shtick with each other does get repetitive.  But still, when it was over I felt let into a world very different from what I'd expect, and in some ways as messy and
sad as any other dysfunctional family.",1454889600,,1156,4.419811320754717
