These DVDs, taken from kinescope recordings, do not have great picture quality. and some of the stories are pretty cornball to the more sophisticated audiences of today,but it is still great to see the old stars, and the early performances of young actors who later became stars.",1187827200,4,345,4.9655172413793105
2807222,2,B000P1KPIQ,"Suspense is one of the Greatest Radio Shows in the history boardcasting.
Outstanding writing with performances from many big name stars of 1940's.

The Suspense TV series after viewing these 30 episodes for first time is a let down. It uses many of the same stories as the Radio series even some of same actors like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre.
But I just don't get the same Thrill and tension while watching as I do listening.

Radio, The Theater of the Mind is a more powerfull tool then what actually
can be shown over the TV.",1185235200,7,531,4.463917525773196
2807223,5,B000P1KPIQ,"This horror anthology TV series was broadcast on ""live"" television, meaning it was never filmed.  The episodes are preserved courtesy of a method known as ""kinescope"" so don't expect superb prints.  No one has superb prints.  But . . . the picture and sound quality is as good as it gets and thank goodness someone put them out.  This is the first of three box sets containing the SUSPENESE TV series, and they have NEVER been available on VHS or DVD before.  I do recommend you buy the book on SUSPENSE (also available on Amazon) as a companion piece and enjoy!",1179878400,47,562,4.524752475247524
8188218,5,B000P1KPIQ,"Watch these and see how difficult it must have been to film these early b/w  episodes on a not so big budget. Trying everything to look as real as possible. You might  catch  the shadow of a mic,or a big b/w studio camera, actually see them in a scene with actors rushing back and forth. But,each show has this magic, of you watching  as they are doing it now not taped and canned these days. Yes, I  do remember live TV..A  lot of it was indeed wonderful. You will see what I mean as some really big stars  show up and  do a great job. It's like being in the audience of a ""live"" Broadway show. Mostly superb.",1354320000,,610,4.110169491525424
8188219,4,B000P1KPIQ,"INFINITY's three SUSPENSE collections are dubbed from antique kinescopes, a process in which a film camera is pointed at a TV monitor and synched so that it doesn't capture a raster flicker. The sound is particularly clear, undoubtedly because audio was directly patched from a mixing board. Video quality is a bit grainy and similar to other kinescopes in that the picture's edges are missing and the view favors one side of the screen. I notice a slight tilt to the right.

When the long-running SUSPENSE radio program made a jump to television in 1949, several crew members and show scripts also came along. Of greatest prominence are director Robert Stevens and organist Hank Sylvern. Stevens also directed several dozen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-Presents/dp/B000AL733G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>&nbsp;TV episodes. Sylvern was organist on a number of radio shows and the composer of themes for ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin,"" ""Strike It Rich"" and others, plus the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Corbett-Space-Cadet/dp/B0028ZI8E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</a>&nbsp;TV series. He was also an orchestra leader.

I like best the earliest ('49) episodes of SUSPENSE, for they illustrate how post-war TV was a ""learn as you go"" process. These programs with live AUTO-LITE commercials run over 29 minutes each. It's impressive to see actors under the pressure of a live broadcast hit their marks, get their lines right and emote without overdoing it. Because of Sylvern's ever-present organ, SUSPENSE on TV is much like radio with pictures.

Of the dozens of TV series DVD collections in my home library, the Lost TV Episodes of SUSPENSE are among my very favorites. They're not perfect by any means, but they are perfect examples of what television was like over 60 years ago. Highest recommendation for fans of historic ""live"" TV broadcasts.

8188220,5,B000P1KPIQ,"I bought this for a friend who is a big fan of old time radio which used to air episodes of Suspense. So when he found out they came out with DVDs of ""The Lost Episodes"" of the Suspense series, he was ecstatic. I ordered it for his birthday and it arrived in about a week. As to the actual episodes, I wouldn't know if they are worth buying because I'm not a fan of anything older than the 90's but he watched them all within a week and had raving reviews about them.",1293926400,,467,3.978723404255319
8188221,1,B000P1KPIQ,"Aside from the aesthetic value of having these shows from the days of old TV, the quality of the video is understandably not the best...but what could have been upgraded is the audio quality which is terrible, you have to strain to understand the dialogue...at the very least give it some high end EQ and tone down the bass...not hard to do.

As for plot and acting, most episodes are flat, painfully boring, and downright stupid...with the exception a very few, the acting is awful.

And then there's that background organ that makes it all the worse; it never stops and is louder than the dialogue at times.",1250812800,3,609,4.62962962962963

Many hours of old-fashioned dramatic entertainment.",1242950400,,382,5.17741935483871
8188223,4,B000P1KPIQ,"I've long counted myself a fan of old-time radio dramas, and the Suspense radio program (1942-1962) has always been my favorite. For most of its run, the program was broadcast from Hollywood and borrowed top Hollywood actors each week to star in gripping 30-minute (and for a time 60-minute) dramas. In addition to the generally excellent writing and production values, part of the appeal of the radio program has always been hearing stars as diverse as Ronald Reagan, Fibber McGee and Molly, Frank Sinatra, Stan Freberg, Sterling Holloway (voice of Winnie-The-Pooh), and so many other Hollywood notables step outside their usual roles to play characters facing (usually) life-or-death situations. For years, I had heard and read about the Suspense TV show which aired from 1949-1954. The radio shows from that time period almost always put in a plug for the TV version at the end of each episode. Until now, though, fewer than a half-dozen episodes were known to exist, and they were in circulation among collectors in fuzzy, multi-generation VHS copies. I had those and was fascinated by the ability to ""watch"" my favorite radio show and through the snowy, faded, images on my screen, catch a glimpse of real ""live"" TV from very early in the medium's history.

I was astounded to learn of this DVD set shortly before its release. Kinescopes of some 90 TV episodes of Suspense had been discovered and were to be released on DVD!? It was such a ""dream come true"" that at first, I thought it must be some kind of late April Fool's Day joke. But now that I've watched most of Volume 1 (with Volume 2 waiting on my shelf), I know that it's no joke! The episodes really are here, complete with original Auto-Lite commercials (and closing CBS logo) intact. The print quality, despite the flaws, is still far above the nearly unwatchable VHS episodes I had. As others have pointed out, these shows were preserved on kinescopes (basically, a motion picture film camera mounted in front of a television monitor) and the picture on most is mediocre (some are a little worse, others a bit better). Still, this is the best picture we're ever likely to get, and it's just amazing that these survived at all. The kinescopes were NOT used for West Coast time-delay (as another reviewer suggested) since the entire TV show was repeated live for the West Coast. The audio quality varies too. Some episodes, like ""A Night At The Inn,"" are so muddy that the dialogue is at times nearly incomprehensible, but for most, the sound is o.k. You can always clearly understand the Auto-Lite spokesman, even if you can't understand the dialogue in the story!

Having watched a couple dozen episodes now, I have to admit that the TV shows are mildly disappointing compared to the radio version. Most episodes are adapted from radio scripts, but without the big name actors and top-notch music and sound effects heard on radio. On TV, the actors are usually decent (a few are painfully bad), music is supplied only by an organ, and the sets restrict the viewer's imagination. The series was broadcast live from a soundstage in New York City, and it's quite remarkable that they were able to construct the sets they did for each episode, but they just can't compete with the ""sets"" in my mind when listening to the radio show.

Despite the rather primitive special effects, weak acting, and uneven audio and video quality, I would still recommend this DVD set. The shows are still entertaining in their own right, but are even more entertaining when one considers their historical context. Fans of old-time radio and early television will probably be delighted with this set and its companion volumes (as I am), but those more accustomed to slickly-produced, action-packed modern-day suspense programs like ""24"" will probably be disappointed. Still, I'm thrilled to be able to own these Suspense episodes on DVD. I'm so glad Infinity has taken the time to properly transfer and make these historic programs available. Thank you!",1202256000,9,3999,4.88659793814433
8188224,5,B000P1KPIQ,"Infinity Entertainment, in association with CBS, has done a great job in bringing these rare shows to DVD.  Only 90 episodes have survived from this 6-season show, running from 1949 thru 1954.  Infinity is bringing us all 90 shows over 3 box sets.  Each set contains 4 DVDs.

You have to get past the image quality issues, as these shows only survive as kinescopes--which are film recordings taken directly from a live video monitor.  They exist in no other form and we're damned lucky to be able to see these today.  The quality of the writing and acting easily overcome these technical limitations.  Plus, it's REAL live TV, so you can look for all of the gaffes that inevitably happen!",1192579200,4,688,4.683333333333334
8188225,4,B000P1KPIQ,"The stories in this series are surprisingly good. Unlike many early TV thrillers, these actually generate a good amount of suspense. So they are worth seeing for that reason. Another reason to watch them is the casts. It can be great fun spotting faces that will become well-known in later years: Lee Marvin, Eva Marie Saint, Barry Nelson, Anne Francis, Leslie Neilson and many others who were literally unknown in 1949-51. On the other hand, at least one episode features the legendary acting teacher Stella Adler. Some of the acting on these shows (all performed LIVE) is poor, and actors occasionally flub their lines (even when they only have one!). The productions are very low-budget too. But the writing, most of the acting, and the fascinating casts can add up to some pretty entertaining viewing. Some episodes contain the entire Auto-Lite commercial material (it goes on a long time, but you can fast-forward), and some episodes have it cut out. These programs exist only in kinescope (a filmed image of a TV monitor). They were probably not meant for posterity, but for showing on the West Coast, assuming they were produced in NYC. The quality of the kinescopes is variable, but some do look quite good, too bad the audio was not captured in better quality. Still, for those interested in early TV this is one of the best extant anthologies from those long-ago days.",1189987200,14,1378,4.868085106382979
