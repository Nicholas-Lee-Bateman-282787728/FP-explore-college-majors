8442698,3,B004V2D6OK,"Raju (Salman Khan) and Yash (Sanjay Kapoor) are best friends through college.  Afterwards though, Yash takes over the family organized crime business while Raju (unbeknownst to Yash) becomes a CID Inspector.  When Raju is given the assignment to investigate Yash, a conflict of interest seems at hand.

Khan and Kapoor have good chemistry together, and portray best friends well.  The plot, while not credible, is entertaining.  There are no memorable songs, but there is some good choreography.  The film is full of violence, naturally, with some fun action scenes.  Overall, though, it's just an average movie.",1491004800,,612,5.3125
8442699,5,B004V2D6OK,"This is a great Salman Khan movie. The acting and plot are both good. Salman plays a best friend but also does some action work. But with me the somgs in a Bollywood movie are just as important if not more so, that the acting and plot.  The musical numbers are top notch - great music, great singing and great dancing. The ""South Asian Macarena"" was especially enjoyable. Salman and company have pulled off another great movie.",1351468800,,427,4.545454545454546

The film starts off well and keeps you interested Salman's entry is too corny though but when Salman and Sanjay Kapoor meet again the film gets better The friendship scenes are well handled.",1304467200,,233,4.9743589743589745
