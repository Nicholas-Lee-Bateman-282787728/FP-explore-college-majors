8035816,4,B0003103IU,"THE DEATH SQUAD is a made-for-TV movie from 1974. It concerns the group of the title, kidnapping and eliminating criminals they believe to have escaped justice. This SQUAD is a cabal of rogue cops, carrying out their own brand of vigilante ""justice"". Enter Robert Forster (ALLIGATOR, JACKIE BROWN) as officer Eric Benoit, a cop, sent under cover to infiltrate THE DEATH SQUAD.  This theme was explored the previous year in Clint Eastwood's MAGNUM FORCE, as well as nine years later, in Michael Douglas' THE STAR CHAMBER (1983). Forster is very good in his conflicted role, as are the rest of the multi-star cast, including Michele Phillips (DILLINGER), Claude Akins (TV's THE NIGHT STALKER, THE NORLISS TAPES), Mark Goddard (TV's LOST IN SPACE, BLUE SUNSHINE), Melvyn Douglas (BEING THERE, GHOST STORY), and Kenneth Tobey (THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA). Recommended for fans of 70's TV crime dramas / thrillers...",1457913600,,974,5.1257861635220126
