8345851,5,B001VAMU3I,Honest and true a joy to watch! Really helps to see life as it is meant to be lived in freedom from self!,1398556800,,105,3.608695652173913
8345852,5,B001VAMU3I,The dvd is well done and I enjoyed watching it. It was intriguing to hear Jon's sister throw out the possibility of Jon being described as a highly evolved soul.,1385683200,,161,4.4
8345853,5,B001VAMU3I,"A saw two great movies about men with Down syndrome - one we might call high functioning and one who does not speak with words.  They joy of life they both have, the need of their caregivers and friends to know what it is they really are saying and want, and their tremendous value to the world - indeed the great gifts both have given to seemingly everyone they encounter - are amazing to anyone who does not know somebody with Down syndrome.  The two movies - Teachings of Jon and Shorty starring Shorty Simms - show you this across what is called the functional spectrum.",1361750400,,574,4.40566037735849
8345854,5,B001VAMU3I,"This film was lovingly created by the subject's sister and what a fine film work it is.  It stands on its own for the ages as a tribute to those we so minimize in our society because we have little understanding of their true gifts and contributions to our world.  I applaud the director for making a non-mainstream film with so much soul and charm - not to mention her entire family having the courage to be so honest on the record.  It's ""Rocky"" for the challenged set and, by challenged, I mean us ""normal"" folks who have had the good fortune of entering life without additional weights to carry. We are clueless about what true joy really is and genuine, selfless love in the way to which the Jons of the world seem congenitally attuned.  What a great story!  What a great family!  What a fantastic sister!  What an inspiration Jon is to help us look at our world in the way it really is... little more askew than we think.  THANK YOU for giving us this film to learn by.",1356739200,,975,4.318681318681318
8345855,5,B001VAMU3I,"I saw this film on a local PBS station several years ago, and immediately went to purchase it online. The film is a documentary highlighting the life and family members of ""Jon,"" a young man with down syndrome. The film spends some time relating Jon's daily routine, all with a good deal of humor and affection. Jon's parents and three siblings (one of whom, a sister, is the film's creator) all give honest details regarding their initial feelings about Jon, and their realization over time about what a blessing it truly is to have him as part of their family. The film, no longer than 90 minutes, brings up great points of discussion for a school classroom regarding Down Syndrome, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a chance at a fresh perspective on life in general. I think about this film from time to time, and I can honestly say that it has had a lasting impact on my life.",1262563200,7,891,4.506172839506172
