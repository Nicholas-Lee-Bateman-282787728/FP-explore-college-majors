To elaborate, I bought this series and a few film-adaptations of Journey to the West as a gift to myself for finishing the novel (the revised four-volume set by Anthony Yu, also highly recommended). The other film adaptations were feature-length and, naturally, highly adapted to fit. This series, on the other hand, is essentially entirely-unabridged. Almost every significant scene or event from the novel is included. The costumes are awesome, the special effects and sets are gorgeous, and (this may be a personal thing) the subtitles are just the right blend of comprehensible and hilarious. I've already forced several friends to watch a few of my favorite scenes. Definitely my most highly-recommended Journey To The West film, especially to those who have read and enjoyed the Classic.",1466467200,2,808,5.271317829457364
8529391,1,B008P6168Q,"The only thing I can gave a 4 star rating is Amazon.com service for returning defective item.
As usual, the English subtitle is shamefully bad, the quality of the discs itself are dreadful. On close examination, the discs on which the series were recorded on is of  substandard quality and showed telltale signs of defect. I watch the first two discs without any problem but close to the end of disc three, problem began. It began to stutter, pause, stutter and freeze. I quickly returned the discs to Amazon for a refund.",1455408000,,522,4.673913043478261

8529393,5,B008P6168Q,"Really good story. I love this tale and enjoy talking with the kids what they learned both good and bad from the various characters. There is a lot of messages that are good to pass onto your kids found in this epic tale. One thing though. This Dvd does not work on our dvd machines. One person above said you can get a dvd player from Walmart that plays PAL. This is one route. Another route is, if your computer has a player in it, you can watch the dvd with no problem. Just load and run your dvd player. Some may prompt you first as to region. Simply pick the region and then load your player and watch the dvd! Note, some computers will allow you to set the region a few times then it becomes the standard so watch out. You may have to reset the player down the line so it plays our region. Just a note.
Anyway, this is a great series. Yes, the tech. can be goofy at times, but it still is a great story and well worth the time and patience needed to read the sub titles. These run quickly and are not in fluent English, but you do get the idea what is happening. I love the story line and am not picky about these things overall.",1369958400,7,1135,4.0488888888888885
8529394,5,B008P6168Q,"So yes, you may have to buy a DVD player that can play PAL. I got mine from a nearby Chinatown for less than $30, and it works very nicely. Anyone with an interest in world movies should make this modest investment anyway.

The English subtitles are very bad (clearly not reviewed by an English-speaking editor), making you wonder if a cheap machine translation software was used. And yes, you'll have to keep your remote in hand because long strings of texts are sometimes visible only for a second.

The music is bad, obviously copied from Starwars -- but definitely not making it.

The special effects are also Starwars-inspired/copied (eg red lightning flashes extremely evocative of the dark side initiates in Clone Wars), but often tacky and antiquated.

And no one ever seems to speak in this series. They only scream and gesticulate.

So why do I give it 5 stars? Because it all combines with a certain charm, and it's part of the cultural adventure you should be after if you want to watch Journey to the West. (""They're not bugs, stupid! They're features."")

Talk about an odyssey! From the celestial realms at the court of the Emperor of Jade to Hades-like underworlds, every episode is filled with mythological beings, with buddhas and bodhisattvas turning up every five minutes.

I got hooked quickly and ended up watching so many episodes in a row that I had to take aspirin (all this screaming!)

If the idea is to educate yourself in the Chinese culture, you may greatly benefit from this series. If you are trying to educate your kids in mythology, it's also a good choice. Also very valuable viewing if you are studying Buddhism.

I started this review with a few negatives so you are warned and won't complain after buying it. Don't worry about the bad subtitles. They'll make you smile, and the series remains perfectly intelligible. Be vigilant, listening for Starwars music passages, and that too will make you smile.

Truth is, I loved it, and definitely learned quite a bit watching it.",1361318400,10,2010,4.783236994219653
8529395,4,B008P6168Q,"Before describing the product, I would like to say Asian Media Market was very helpful. You should know that this product is a PAL DVD and Not NTSC which is typically what we use in the United States. Before fulfilling my order they wrote an Email and asked me to check my DVD.

I did and sadly it was NTSC, I was informed by Asian Media Market that I could obtain a DVD player that would play PAL DVDs at Walmart for about $40.00, low and behold I found one at Walmart for 49.99 and it works like a charm. Thank you Asian Media Market, I appreciated all your help!

Now for the DVD set Journey to the West.

This is a Chinese television series adapted from the classical novel of the same title containing all 66 episodes of the 2011 series. Right or wrong I'm going to assume you are familiar with the story Journey to the West already or you wouldn't be looking at this product, if not Journey to the West is a 500-year-old tale by Wu Cheng'en that is based off the real-life pilgrimage of the Buddhist monk Xuanzang. The story follows Xuanzang as he eventually joins ranks with the magical Monkey King, a gluttonous pig spirit, a river-ogre, and the third prince of the Dragon King, on a quest to retrieve Buddha's scrolls from India - as a means (both literally and symbolically) of attaining enlightenment. It's a fantastical yarn that is deeply rooted in Chinese folk religion, philosophy, mythology, and value systems in general.

It is a fairly faithful adaption of the story. Large cast [if you have seen the 2008/09 film Red Cliffs you will see that Zang Jinsheng who was Zhang Fei in that film, plays Zhu Bajie ""Pigsy"" in this series], large sets and plenty of CGI. When we start following Sun Wukong (The Monkey King), the makeup was reminiscent of the original Planet of the Apes with Roddy McDowall. Okay maybe leaning towards the 1974 TV series Land of the Lost, especially the special effects. Wu Yue as Sun Wukong is brilliant as the monkey king and injects enough feelings in the role. His fighting scenes are good to show his style. But his appearance did not do him enough justice as you can see how hard he struggles to talk at times.

When you start meeting the characters Sun Wukong faces you may be reminded of the Power Rangers. This gets better when the actually Journey begins, and becomes more of a Wuxia story.

As it may compare to ""Lord of the Rings"" traveling epic story wise, it does not compare to those films in effects.

Zhang Jizhong, who produced this series, is in the pre-production phase of a film adaptation of Journey to the West. He has hired Neil Gaiman as a screenwriter and the two were introduced to each other by James Cameron, who turned down the role as director, but has agreed to help with the special effects of the film. Each of the three films in the trilogy is expected to have a budget of $100 million, which would make them the most expensive films made in Chinese history. John Woo's Red Cliff budgeted roughly $80 million and currently holds the record for the Chinese film with the highest budget. As Zhang is also developing a theme park, an online game and this television series all based on Sun Wukong and Journey to the West, I think it's easy to say he is a fanboy of the story and just as engrossed as Peter Jackson is in J. R. R. Tolkien's stories.

SUBTITLES - these are pretty bad. Good enough to follow, but if you are unfamiliar with Mandarin make sure you have your remote handy to pause to read all the dialogue or make sense of it. The wording is so poor it makes me wonder if Hollywood is this bad when they subtitle films for the international market. I certainly hope not.

All said I enjoyed this series, if Zhang Jizhong ever makes the first true crossover Sino-Western epic film, I'll definitely see that too. That would at least attract those who cannot stand subtitles. I can tolerate and enjoy what some may call ""cheesy effects"", the subtitling drops a star.",1353542400,17,3946,4.484679665738161
