8304738,5,B001GBIOSW,Love this DVD! It's great for any fitness level. You can feel the difference even after one workout!,1490572800,,100,4.611111111111111
8304739,4,B001GBIOSW,"I like JOYCE VEDRAL. I have used her programs off and on for years . I appreciate that she put this compilation of AB WORKOUTS together for a routine almost everyday. What I don't appreciate is she and her ripping through them like they would rather be somewhere else, doing something else. Toning exercises are supposed to be done slower. I have never known for an Instructor to tear through a routine in the manner in which she and her daughter, ""MARTHE"", does on this ""DVD"". I did day/routine number four today, and MARTHE was counting so fast, like she was on speed. Not only was she counting fast, she was speeding through the exercises. She and ""JOYCE"" have a responsibility to their viewers/exercisers. They are supposed to instruct responsibly and in good form. The exercises are excellent, but I would suggest learning each one and then do the routine at a slower pace. At the pace they're going, a person could probably injure themself. For awhile I was doing only days one and three. But I've decided to move on and try the rest of the routines. I am reluctantly giving this program FOUR STARS.  As I've said, the exercises are good, but the instruction and their form is awful. JOYCE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN THIS. I'M DISAPPOINTED, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THUS PROGRAM, AT A SLOWER PACE.",1458518400,5,1308,4.637931034482759
8304740,4,B001GBIOSW,Great workout!,1436313600,,14,6.5
8304741,5,B001GBIOSW,"I adore Dr. Joyce Vedral! She has a great sense of humor and gives genuine encouragement and support throughout the workout.  The exercises are powerful yet simple to follow (which is ideal for me -  I can't stand routines that demand aerobics/jumping up and down!!) Every exercise Joyce presents has slow burning reps that really do provide results. I lost 8lbs in one week from using the ""Just Abs"" and ""Just Arms & Thighs"" DVDs.",1435795200,5,431,4.733333333333333
8304742,5,B001GBIOSW,"This is a great ab workout.  6 routines, so you can use them as she recommends or mix them up according to your needs any given day.  The workouts are challenging, but Joyce is encouraging for beginners.  The videos are better when she's not the one counting, but after you do the video a few times you don't need the counting quite as much, so in the end it is fine.  Mostly, I enjoy the variety of exercises and combinations.  The moves are simple, surprisingly challenging, and very effective.",1397433600,5,496,4.52808988764045
8304743,5,B001GBIOSW,My husband and I have been using this for the last few weeks even though I have had this for a few years now.  I had been using other stomach workouts and then decided that we might as well start this and do it with Joyces other workouts.  My husband is a handsome guy with a great build but has always had problems with keeping his tummy down but it looks like the combined Joyce programs are working for him. Just over two months ago we both started a serious committed work out program and he is surprised at how much his body and self esteem and energy level has improved. Joyce is tough but that is what it takes to get results. I feel a deep burn in my stomach by the final set and that is saying something as I am a die hard exerciser.  I am such a believer in exercise as the fountain of youth as it makes everything in your life better and when you look good and feel good you are also pleasanter to be around and life runs smoother.  Joyce is just great and does things old school but I can tell you that it works and besides it helps that she is a little crazy because you get thru the workout faster while having a good giggle.,1326326400,9,1139,4.0488888888888885
8304744,5,B001GBIOSW,"I think this is a great workout.  You can take it at your own pace and just do fewer reps.  Joyce even says that in her video, so don't worry if you feel she is going too fast.  She just wants you to do what you can.  The later days in the week are harder.  She says on the video that you can stick with day 1 and 2 until you are ready for the harder stuff.  Day 3 is fairly easy.  I didn't think it was too hard/fast until the later days in the week.  I started taking rests there.",1272758400,7,482,3.702970297029703
8304745,5,B001GBIOSW,"I really like this video.  There are 6 workout routines, but one day is so long that I split it up into 2 workouts, for a total of 7.  Each routine is very different from the next and each is challenging.  I really enjoy Joyce's running commentary.  She's so sassy and fiesty.  I also like how she has a second person doing the workout with her, and that person does the counting so Joyce can give pointers and motivational tips.",1263513600,6,429,4.3125
8304746,3,B001GBIOSW,"This dvd has six workout days and each day runs from 6 min to 20 min. On some days the instructor is going extremely too fast, and someone at beginners level is not able to keep up with the pace.",1244678400,3,195,3.9
