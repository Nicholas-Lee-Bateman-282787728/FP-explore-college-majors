4402315,2,B004LROMSY,"I hoped against hope that this show would get better.  Never did.  The acting was abominable, the casting of a weasel-faced tween as Arthur is laughable at best, and the relationships were hamhanded and superficial.  The show has a production quality of campier things like Xena and Hercules... actually a lot worse in some cases.  The greatest sin is that with this level of camp, there's no wit to go with it.  No wink to the audience to let us know ""Hey, it's just for fun.""  Nope... they want you to take this godawful show seriously.  In a time where we can watch Spartacus or Game of Thrones as a way to gorge ourselves on wicked political intrigue, fantastic scapes and savage contests of martial brutality, this show falls short in every category.  Save your money.  While this show is on a premium channel, it's cable access quality.  My condolences to Claire Forlani and Joseph Fiennes' career choices.  Many happy returns, you poor lot.",1308787200,12,947,4.713414634146342
4402316,1,B004LROMSY,"This show is terrible.  As in atrocious.  The acting is flat and cheesy.  Either that and they are doing the Joseph Fiennes version of scene chewing over acting.  I have never seen him in worse form.  The sets are obviously sets.  They look like sets from a stage production.  The props were the same as well as the costumes.

I did not mind the re-writes to the plot line of the Camelot/Arthurian legends.  The worse part of it was the 90210 relationship between Arthur and Guinevere.  It not only got to be grating and full of teen style angst, but it took up way to much time on the screen.  Too much kissy kissy, too little of the kingdom building.  There is just not enough interesting character expositions and action.  The characters in short are boring.  Even the King.  Which is really bad.  Because that is who is supposed to be the central character.

The sad thing is that the most interesting plot line with King Lot was stopped much to fast as the just killed him off.  Sad that.  Because Eva Green as Morgan is just boringtown.  I have not seen a more unconvincing villain in a very long time.  She is also chewing some scenery with her over acting.

This show was SO bad that we did not even care to watch the last three episodes.  Which is VERY disappointing because when I first heard about this show I was very very excited as was my wife.  Now was are both disgusted.  We had to go watch Excalibur just to wash the foul taste of Camelot from our mouths.  Very disappointing indeed.  I would give the show no stars if Amazon let me do it.

Spend your time watching other current fantasy genre shows that blow this tripe out of the water in every conceivable way possible.  I know we did.",1308528000,14,1706,4.361022364217252
4402317,1,B004LROMSY,"Where to start...

This show has horrible acting (with the exception of Eva Green), poor script writing and the character Arthur is horribly miscast.  This series is a horrible adaptation of a great story.

I watched the entire season hoping it would somehow recover but unfortunately it only got worse.  Many of the scenes are so bad they become actually comical.  Not even worthy of 1 star.",1308441600,17,392,4.791044776119403
4402318,4,B004LROMSY,"I do realize that it's a matter of opinion that people write on these reviews. That being said, if you don't like it, then just say that. Don't try to steer people away by falsely claiming it was poorly written, or had bad casting, or was a bad series. I am one of the biggest movie/TV fans around, and I'm highly critical of most shows. That being said, this show is phenomenal.

Set aside Joseph Finnes always top notch acting, this show was well done. Well written, well acted for a relatively lesser known cast, and well worth watching again.

If you are a fan of this type of show, buy the blu ray. You won't be disappointed. With gorgeous cinematography to boot, you may not like it, but you can't blame this show for being any negatives a few critics are pushing.",1308268800,5,770,4.3776223776223775
4402319,2,B004LROMSY,"If you haven't seen this series, find it online first before you purchase.  It's full of inconsistent writing and mis-casting.  I wouldn't waste my money to purchase this....but find it online and view it for yourself before you spend your money on something you'd re-gift if someone gave it to you.",1308182400,6,299,4.8431372549019605
4402320,2,B004LROMSY,"Why is it that king Arthur looks like a surfer ""dude"". And generally speaking the acting is bad and too dramatic. Too childish.",1308182400,9,127,4.565217391304348
4402321,4,B004LROMSY,"Sturdy as the tale of Camelot is and despite both cinematic versions as well as the now famous musical based on the story, television has now taken on the tale and the results as seen by a solitary episode appear to be entertaining as well as a darker and more earthbound version of the dream kingdom of Camelot.  As is usually the case with miniseries the writers vary from episode to episode (Michael Hirst, Thomas Malory, Louise Fox, Steve Lightfoot and Chris Chibnall) as well as the directors (Mikael Salomon, Ciaran Donnelly, Jeremy Podeswa, and Stefan Schwartz), but the cast remains the same and the overall feeling of the series is one that is seductively dark and has a real sense of a mixture of history and legend.

So far we have met King Uther as he dies passing on the crown to the King's unknown son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), heretofore known as a commoner.  Arthur's half sister Morgan (a sinister and beautiful Eva Green) is put in place as Arthur's nemesis, Arthur's journey to kingship is nurtured by Merlin (Joseph Fiennes), and weaving in and out of the opening episode are Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani) and the glowing Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton). Thus far the story is focused on a tough battle ahead for the charming young Arthur against the evil vixen Morgan.  It seems to be developing well, but time will reveal whether it will be a worthy successor to the many other versions of the story.  So far it is worth watching: the setting is gorgeous!

4402322,4,B004LROMSY,"I am reviewing maybe prematurely, the new Starz series Camelot based on a sneak preview for subscribers I had the FUN of viewing over the weekend. I enjoyed seeing the beautiful and always ""mysterious"" Eve Green as Morgana and Joseph Fiennes in the role of Merlin. This saga starts out with a familiar story line which might be my only criticism....just seemed similar to Pillars of the Earth to me right down to some almost stereotypical medieval characters....the story however is facinating enough that if you enjoy the legend of King Arthur as I do, you'll be inrigued enough to want to tune in. Starz says this sereis will start in April 2011.
Enjoy....hopefully the rest of it is as Tempting as the sneak preview.

It's a shame they didn't finish this series because the cliff hanger was just errrrrr....frustrating. The costumes, the actors, the intro why oh why.

4402378,1,B004LROMSY,"I really wanted to like this, but I should have known they'd load it up with soft core porn. Sure, Eva Green is easy on the eyes, but she's better than this, so is much of the rest of the cast, except for those who are MIScast, like the kid they got to play Arthur. That was the best they could do? Maybe they blew the budget on Eva Green and simply couldn't afford a better Arthur. Another reason this doesn't deserve recommendation is the fact that it was canceled, so really, even if you do care for the show, it's just a big tease. I wish streaming services would quit padding their content inventory with incomplete series like this. It's more than a little annoying. Last but not least, I absolutely despised the liberties they took with Arthurian legend, particularly the Lady in the Lake. I found that to be particularly repugnant, and puts the icing on the cake when I say I cannot recommend this at all. On the other hand,  I'd highly recommend saving yourself a lot of time and simply watching John Boorman's classic film ""Excalibur"" (1981) instead. It's a magnificent telling of the story with an outstanding cast, including a young Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart, and Gabriel Byrne, plus something this thing lacks: an ending.",1487376000,8,1251,4.635135135135135
4402379,4,B004LROMSY,I only have a few critiques for this show. I don't like the lead actor who plays king Arthur: He's a bad actor and he look more like a California Surfer than a king.

There is one glaring issue -- Guinevere looks like a Santa Monica beach bimbo.  Really, I'm sure no one's hair looked like that in Arthurian England.  She would still be gorgeous if they styled her more authentically, and there wouldn't be the constant distraction that she looks like an ad for cheap hair care products.  Also, I'm intrigued by the ""rewriting"" of the Arthurian legends.  On the one hand, it's creative; on the other, it's distracting (again.)

4402448,4,B004LROMSY,"Bottom line:  Cheesy, but great fun, cancelled series

Camelot: Season 1 really should just be listed as ""Camelot: The Complete Series"" as there was only the one season.  Great fun, actually pretty good acting...but horrible script.  Perfect example of how you can still screw up a ""sure thing,"" and certainly has a role on college courses on how not to run a show.  So many divergent thoughts I'm surprised the Good Idea Fairy didn't make her own cameo appearance, and many of them were good...just...no idea how to write them into the show.  So you're left with a rather confusing mess....  If you're watching for fun, you can forgive much and enjoy the ride.  If you're trying to get invested in the story...well.....

At the end of the day, the series is much like Pop Tarts....I know it isn't the best thing I could consume, there are soooo many better things...yet...it's quite tasty and I enjoy it anyway  (as long as I don't think about just how good this show *could* have and *should* have been...).

A lot of good things, but the writing is lacking. Characters do a lot of weird things and make decisions that rarely make sense. The worst part is King Arthur. The actor may be good for many other roles, but King is not one of them. They try and try to make him look strong, but he just seems to weak and hard to believe that people would follow him. The other character lacking is Merlin. The actor has been good in other roles but for some reason he believes that a furrowed brow is the key to show his darkness.

Even the reworking of the mythology and the ridiculous extrication of Excaliber are unbearable.  Don't waste your time....rewatch another telling of this tale.",1463184000,,450,4.894736842105263

While I thought the casting was very good (Arthur, Morgan, and Merlin were fantastic) the first few episodes were pretty average. Still I was hooked on the story very early on and really fell in the love with a lot of the cinematography.
The last two episodes were phenomenal. These two specifically were action packed and I was actually gasping and yelling at the characters as the episodes played, and I'm not that kind of viewer. Sadly, all good things must come to an end and Starz only made one season.

4402634,3,B004LROMSY,"The gold standard for Arthurian film is John Boorman's 1981 classic, Excalibur. Yet there's always an eager audience for endless retellings of this seminal mythology. And while Jamie Campbell Bower is no Nigel Terry and Eva Green is no Helen Mirren this one is better than most.

This series is strong during its first two and last two episodes but sags badly in the middle where it loses its energy almost entirely at times. Still, I, for one, can never get quite enough of Eva Green. She's brilliant playing the woman every mother warns their sons about but none of us ever listens.",1460764800,,584,4.669902912621359

I will say that it kept me watching the entire season. not sure why.",1452902400,,375,4.449275362318841
4402692,2,B004LROMSY,"Well, if this is anything at all like the original concept of Arthur, then I have grown wings and feathers.  since I am not airborne and feather-brained, this mess is just simply goofy. Laugh out loud goofy? No, that would signify some enjoyment of the show.  No, I doubt I am alone in the opinion that finally, Hollywood has crossed the final frontier of stupidity.  No insult to star whatever, but that was also annoying.  I wasn't expecting much in terms of watchable moments, so that's a bonus. But, honestly...If you're aged anywhere above the age of 12, you've either never heard of things such as cinematic license....I could barely recognize this production as coming even a nails shred close to the immortal tale.  In plain english, this sucked.  First, for verite, no one is dirty. They all wear clean, most likely pressed, ""peasants"" garb, they're all apparently well fed and dirt in daily life has conveniently been swept away. By pixies, one imagines, but there is that troublesome pixie union to deal with, should you defame then in any way! Wouldn't want that on my conscience.  So pixies are out, and Merlin, a dark, broody and not-quite-sneering  Finnes, quietly killing the series all by himself.  He just didn't have the presence of command in this role. He makes it look somehow more foolish than it needed to be.  So, back to the forest...Arthur's character had me wincing in pain at every snide glace and smoldering temper shot,  especially around that naughty dame, Gwen.  BTW, Gwen isn't married to Arthur...No, she's hanging her skirts up for Leontes, Arthur's alleged hit man.  Way to snarky and always with beautifully crafted hair, just so. I think the entire production was tired of her, after a bit. Whiny, pouty and sneaky, Ol' Gwen gets hooked up on a beach scene.....in the English countryside, no less.  Limited water right next to a forest. So she loses IT to Arthur, then tries to fool poor old Leontes that the blood on their connubial bedding is, of course, hers. I call foul (fowl?) on that. What hooey.

I could expound on the other aspects of the show, but won't bother. If, as I have stated, your mind hasn't fully matured and grown up for you, say such as that of a teenaged wannabe.......you will probably like this series. But if you are educated, mature, aware of the realities of actual life, then this garbage is just not meant for adult eyes.  The kiddies will love it, but for a more advanced audience, chug some wine, smoke a fattie and find something, anything else to watch.  This production cannot hold its own, which I am guessing, is the primary reason for its short-lived tenure.",1452729600,,2636,4.733041575492341

4402696,1,B004LROMSY,"WOW.  I'm stunned.  This was made by at least some of the people who did ""The Tudors,"" which, for my money, is one of the most astonishingly done series ever, in every way.  So, I was thrilled to think of these same people having their way with the Arturian myths. I bought season 1, certain of enjoying it - and I find I can barely watch it. I'm fast forwarding in seach of scenes I believe, into the fifth episode.  With the exception of certain amazing actors, not seen nearly enough, like Sinead Cusack and James Purefoy (though there are others, you'll recognize them), many of the key roles are just boring.  I have no idea what they have Joseph Fiennes doing with Merlin, but whatever the concept is, it and he, I'm sad to say, are annoying as hell. Guinevere and her role in it -- just silly, and it gets sillier.  The writing is so often ridiculous and reductive.

4402801,4,B004LROMSY,"While I will not give away any of the basics that make it so, be prepared going in that this 10-part series is unlike any other cinematic version in the Arthurian legend category. Despite that major difference (this is ""Hollywood"" after all), the lone season was entertaining although incomplete. There is no Season Two, due to schedule conflicts with major members of the cast. Even though many modern historians debate/dispute the actual existence of King Arthur, as most of the details concerning Arthur, during the late 5th and early 6th centuries, come from folklore, the legend continues and, if nothing else, provides wonderful entertainment. IMO Eva Green, as Morgan, absolutely stole the show in Camelot. She was completely captivating and convincing as the conniving sorceress daughter of Uther Pendragon. Claire Forlani was beautifully cast as Arthur's biological mother, Lady Igraine. It was, at first, hard for me to accept this depiction of Merlin, portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, but the character grew on me as the season progressed. In terms of Arthur and his men, I was a bit disappointed with Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur as he does not fit the ""mold"" that has been set for this legendary king. That said, the rest were very good to great, especially Clive Standen as Gawain. This series is not on the same scale as Game of Thrones but, overall, the costumes, sets and locations were done very well. If you are looking for something that follows the traditional Arthur storyline, this is not it. If you are looking for a new twist on the tale you may want to explore Camelot. As a note, this is definitely an r-rated version of the beloved story of King Arthur.",1431129600,,1678,4.870629370629371

Merlin never did any magic, Geneviere married someone other than Arthur. Never saw such a show, but just kept watching as loved some of the actors they were great. I don't know who wrote this or who signed the actors but they sure didn't know what they were doing.

When I opened the packaging I noticed that disc 1 had a foggy sticky film on the readable side, which caused the DVD to be unreadable. After trying to clean the film off with a monitor wipe, I rinsed the patted the DVD down with a clean cloth several times. After about 15 min of rinsing and patting, the DVD was finally clear and my player could read it.

4402818,5,B004LROMSY,"Starz ""Camelot"", in the tradition of other popular franchises today with similar medieval themes such as ""Game of Thrones"", is an absolutely fantastic epic series depicting a more realistic, delightfully adult and rated R version of ""King Arthur"" & his knights that hasn't been done since Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirrian, and Liam Nessien in the early 80's, ""Excalibur"".

 Merlin is played well, and the other cast members really are a joy to watch as young Arthur is recruited by Merlin, in a political rivalry on who will take the throne of the deceased Uther Pendragon, who is the father of both Arthur and his sexy and sinister ""fem fatale"" sister Morgan played by the amazing Eva Greene (James Bond, 300 Spartans Rise, Dark Shadows).  The political intrigue, along with Eva's magical and dark sorcery are both magnificent and a great addition to the many portrayals and volumes regarding the mythological legend of ""Camelot"" and King Arthur.

 ""Camelot"" is an awesome series that I found to be equal, if not much better then George RR Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" with HBO, and it was too bad this series ended so early as it did because the actors had other projects to work on.  I personally absolutely love Eva Greene and her work, and as a fan hope to see her do more like this series.

 Another good and interesting take on King Arthur and his legend was done about ten years ago in 2004's ""King Arthur"" with Guy Ritchie.  This film is not as good in my view as this Starz ""Camelot"", but never the less if you are a fan of the Arthur mythology then it is worth checking out.  I liked and agreed with that film's interpretation that Arthur had to have been a Roman soldier stuck in dark age- medieval Britain after the Romans had bailed.  ""Camelot"" does not cover the Romans at all, which would have been a very interesting plot element and avenue for the writers to take if this show went on longer for more seasons, especially having Eva Greene interact with & sexually seduce the Roman centurions.

 Very good dvd and blu ray box series worth your time, two thumbs way up and A+ for Starz ""Camelot"".",1426291200,,2108,4.619302949061662

Also, the SPOILER concept of making the Gwenevere betrayal from King Arthur to ""Lancelot"" instead of the other way around, effectively destroying the good image of the king, was a low and unnecessary blow. Outside of those two things however, I thought it was excellent. I am sorry they did not continue it for any further seasons. Certainly had wonderful period costumes and backdrop.

Whenever the show addresses one of the famous facets of ""Arthurian"" legend (like the Lady in the Lake and the Knights of the Round Table) there is always an original twist, to keep things from getting trite. I personally found two of the main characters (Arthur and Guinevere) unappealing, while my favorites were Morgan, Sybil, Leontes, and Kay. (Fiennes's infamously hammy Merlin is fun to watch, and fitting to the fantastic universe in my opinion.)

All his supporting actors would make better kings than him. The best actor of the show plays Morgan. She is beautiful, strong, intelligent and interesting. Merlin, as a bald headed young guy, actually pulls it off with some good acting. I like the actor who plays Gawain, but alas I can't sink anymore money into a King who would be better suited as a pageboy for Gawain.",1409184000,3,548,4.382352941176471

4402948,5,B004LROMSY,"Be forewarned:
If you are looking for historical accuracy and are pretty anal about it, this show is not for you.
Also, if you get easily hooked on series, this show is also not for you, since the ""ending"" is rather... not there.
This show offers lots of adventure, good character development, plot, story line, and yes, fiction (but what's sci-fi T.V without a little fantasy?). I was not too crazy about Jamie Campbell Bower being cast as King Arthur, but frankly, in an universe where Arthur was playboy turned king (reference to historical inaccuracies again), he really does live up to the character. He is seen evolve from an immature mama's boy to warrior-leader within 12 episodes. Merlin was a nailed cast choice, Fienne's portrayal offers a completely new profile to the legend of Merlin. The same can be said about Eva Green's interpretation of Morgan Pendragon, true, she is a brilliant actress, but in this role you really her glow. The supporting cast carries its own weight as well, such as Kay, Egraine, Leontes, Guinevere, Gawain, etc.
Plus, the DVD version is fully dubbed in Spanish, huge bonus for me.
I was bummed to hear Camelot was not picked up for a second season, apparently it was shined off by Game of Thrones, also, most of its characters are too busy working on other projects of their own.",1408406400,,1320,4.743478260869566

  I personally love period dramas, but Camelot's version of Arthur is a weak character overall. I presume they were trying to show the ""ordinary guy"" side of the legendary character, but unfortunately it was all ordinary and no legendary. The acting was nothing to get excited about, either.",1405900800,,463,4.910256410256411

The whole new aproach, such as having Arthur grow up with a farming family, kept my attention. It is difficult to be original in such a well known story but they succeeded. My only complaint is the unnescesary nudity but that can easily be over-looked when the story is that good. {I also love the cast, especially Joseph Fiennes!}",1403308800,,465,4.5476190476190474

4403016,4,B004LROMSY,"It is a crying shame this show is only one season.  I can only assume its because the stellar cast went on to do other projects, certainly not because the show wasn't worthy.  The entire cast of this show is excellent, but there are some who really stand out:  Joseph Fiennes, Jamie Campbell Bower, Eva Green, and Claire Forlani.  Their performances could not have done more justice to the characters they portrayed.

Camelot is a unique take on the legend and tells the story of Arthur (played by Jamie Campbell Bower) as a young king building a kingdom which not only protects its subjects, but values them and restores their faith and sense of pride in their country.  While Arthur struggles with establishing himself as king, his half sister, Morgan (played by Eva Green), uses every means at her disposal, including deceit and dark magic, to take the crown she sees as rightfully hers.

Merlin (played by Joseph Fiennes) is one of the great surprises in this series.  He is a mysterious man of great passion and inner conflict who has complicated and intense relationships with Arthur, Igraine (Arthur's biological mother played by Claire Forlani) and Morgan, whose similar passion and inner conflict calls to him.

It is very disappointing that this series only has one season, but do not let that stop you from enjoying the work.  It is well worth the time.",1398384000,2,1364,4.7905982905982905

If you like Jamie Campbell Bower then you would enjoy this TV series. I was surprised by all the sexual scenes and bad language in it, esp. since the scenes were from the King Arthur era where those words weren't thought about yet. I do however love that time period so I am really enjoying this 1st and only season. Seller sent the package fast.",1385424000,,497,4.134020618556701

4403117,3,B004LROMSY,"I love this era, King Arthur and his knights. For me the choice of Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur would not have been my first. His acting is weak and I find he does not draw me into the show. Eva Green on the other hand, excels at playing the evil Morgan who is constantly trying to regain her rightful place at the throne. Joseph Fiennes is good in the role as Merlin, even though he can do magic, he regrets it everytime he does. Overall the show is ok.",1382400000,,461,4.076923076923077

Until I saw him in the mortal instruments as jace I didn't know  of him as an actor. So I looked up his films to see what else he has starred in and discovered camelot and I enjoy the chemistry with all charecters. I look forward to future projects.

4403120,3,B004LROMSY,"There is profound drama in this series and that would be the one positive feedback I can provide. However, it does not measure up to the intense story plot, fantasy, magic, special effects and pageantry that surrounded the Merlin series. Where is the magic...where is the pageantry?...where is the integrated fantasy and fiction?...where is the beauty of the filming location, i.e., castle, panorama, etc.?",1381795200,,406,5.359375

4403133,4,B004LROMSY,"...and much easier to follow than Game of Thrones, George R. Martin's convulated tale of criss-crossing kingdoms in peril.  Camelot provides a straight line story that's fun to watch-- a hero's journey, with a deliciously evil and beautiful Morgan, a young, naive and rough Arthur, and a round table of knights that are believable human beings, and who are so vital to helping Arthur rise to his rightful and predestined throne.  Add to this a deliciously real Merlin played by Fiennes, a man conflicted about his magical powers and appropriately mysterious, and an assorted host of characters to care about, from Arthur's mother to the smallest of children, all of whom are affected by the sway of power between Arthur Pendragon and his evil sister. On flaw is the character of Guinevere, who is ENTIRELY 21st century in appearance and attitude. She adds nothing to the plot, because she is totally unbelievable, even given the fact that this is a fantasy.",1381104000,,957,4.937888198757764
4403134,5,B004LROMSY,"Loved it. So upset it was cancelled after only one season. Love Jamie Campbell Bower. He has a great career ahead of him which I will follow. Nice take on the Authur story but again, wish it could have had even one more season.",1379635200,,227,4.181818181818182

4403137,4,B004LROMSY,"This was excellent 1st season of a series.  Can't understand why this wasn't picked up.  Acting was first rate, casting spot-on, locations believable, lighting & set design evocative.  Costumes seemed a little ""strange.""  Fabrics, textures not realistic for time, but then again, as Costume Designer said, we really don't know what they wore.  Very surprised this was not optioned by other network/outlet/production company.  Still should be.  Confused why Camelot not renewed while so many tepid, mediocre series are renewed.  Plan on watching my purchased instant video season 1 multiple times.",1378771200,,596,5.544444444444444
4403138,5,B004LROMSY,wish that they continued the series.  Leaving it as a cliff hanger with no follow-up makes for a sad viewer. I guess that's what happens when they cancel a great show,1378339200,,166,4.354838709677419
4403139,5,B004LROMSY,"So, you've watched The Game of Thrones, The Borgias, and Spartacus and now it is time to watch something else.  Another fantasy?  Or Mad Men, the winding down Sopranos, The Big C or a comedy, perhaps.  And besides, you know all about the legend of King Arthur, you've seen the movies Camelot and Excalibur, right?  Well, wrong.

  Just because something is named Camelot doesn't mean you've seen it before.  The British say, ""You can do anything you want with King Arthur, as long as you never make him the villain.""  And this series decided to remake King Arthur in a way you hadn't thought of before.  Well, partly, but coming from a completely different direction.

  First, Arthur is not blindingly cute nor is he devastatingly handsome.  This Arthur is a pleasant-looking young blonde man who has to make himself stand out and be looked up to for his courage and thinking.  Guinevere is a simple, beautiful young lass who is marrying another man and Morgan is the unloved older sister who has gotten everything wrong in her mind and turned to magic to right the misunderstood wrongs.  All of these people and the rest of the cast flit through your imagination as you watch them on the screen.  You are even surprised to find that Camelot, itself, is an old ruin of a Roman castle with part of the roof missing and overgrown with vines.  Poor Arthur really has to start from scratch!

  The writers decided not to choose between the sword-in-the-stone and the-lady-of-the-lake.  They managed to write a very interesting take on both!  No real sorcery involved in either.  But Arthur is lead to believe there is and what we believe is what makes us what we are.

  The scenery is gorgeous, the CGI is not overly used and the actors are wonderful.  You are easily drawn into this story and want to know more.  Plus it has the sexiness of The Games of Thrones, to appeal to the adult audience, not for children.  In the first season, like GoT, there is not yet a full scale battle scene, but very clever skirmishes.  The way Arthur handles an entire group of foe on his own will delight you.  You will say, ""Yes.  Arthur does deserve to be king!""

  Ah, you think, where is Merlin?  Yes.  Well.  There is the rub.  You can take a great actor, like Joseph Fiennes, and if he is given a bad script, he caun't save the character.  Or maybe, Fiennes was totally miscast.  As an Arthurian fan, and you most like are or you wouldn't be checking this show out, you know that Merlin does not necessarily mean pointed hat, long white beard and flowing gown with stars and moons.  But he should do something besides feel sorry for himself while gloating as well.  He might as well have been wearing a hair shirt and walked around flogging himself.  There is a way to present inner turmoil mixed with duty that is not depressing.  In no way can we feel sorry for this Merlin.

  So, why did this well-written, beautifully filmed (in Ireland), wonderfully acted programme not get a second season?  Well, I believe that mainly you can find the answer in the first paragraph.  On the other hand, it could have been Merlin.  However, as far as the series goes, you will really enjoy it and, since you already know the story, the ending will satisfy you, if not leaving you feeling a bit sorry not to find out poor Arthur and Guinevere's reactions when they find out the truth about Morgan!  But if you are captivated by the Arthurian legend anyway, you can most likely go to another website and read lots of fanfic carrying on the story in varying degrees...or, hey, write your own!",1377907200,,3568,4.5545023696682465
4403140,5,B004LROMSY,Loved this show. Discovered it late. Am disappointed that it wasn't renewed for further seasons. Interesting twist on the Arthur legends.,1377734400,,137,5.571428571428571

4403143,5,B004LROMSY,"I really didn't know what to expect but I hoped that I would like it. I found the first two episodes a bit upsetting but I watched the third one and that's when I saw something intriguing enough to continue. Now I find it quite fascinating. I was shocked at the explicit sexual scenes and I DO NOT LIKE the witchcraft in it, but those were a sign of the times that they lived in. I can always fast forward that. All in all, I would say that the show was well done.",1375488000,,464,4.0

4403146,5,B004LROMSY,"I thought this was an interesting take on the Arthur legend, trying to show how that legend might have come about. I agree with other reviewers that it was very uneven but did begin to find its way toward the end. I found the characters interesting and in some cases-Morgan in particular, very interesting. I found myself routing for Morgan at least half the time. I liked the way they did Merlin, not so much as a court magician but as a more shamanic character. I believe that if there ever was a Merlin, he would have been much like Joseph Fiennes' portrayal. As for Arthur himself, he was a character in flux. But he was supposed to be. The series attempted to show him changing from a dumb carefree kid into a king, adding layers of himself as he went. The final test for me was this: after the last scene, did I wish that there had been more? Yes, I did.",1372032000,,860,4.282208588957055

I will take my chances. she is a rare beauty and a fine actress too. the rest of the cast, particularly fiennes, is very good too, tho I would asses the character playing Arthur as better than ok, but not as strong as some will like.  unfortunately, starz canceled after 1 season. I know the Arthur story well, so I am ok. there are changes in this version, but if you want the scoop, see john boorman's Excalibur, unequalled telling of the Arthur legend. if you are an eva green fan, see this starz show.",1368489600,,602,4.234782608695652
4403151,5,B004LROMSY,"There have been so many movies, and series made, surrounding King Arthur and his kingdom of Camelot, and each has its own merit. But I've only bought this version to keep. From my own perspective, this gritty rendition of the story of the young king who must prove his mettle to take the seat of power, has a greater substance to it. The two characters surrounding Arthur (played well enough by Jamie Campbell Bower), Morgan, the half sister who wants to usurp the throne from the young king, is believably dark, and cunning (played very well by Eva Green) and Merlin, the counselor to the boy-king, who is plagued by his own demons, and strives to equally serve his Master and a psychosis which threatens to devour him (a stunning performance of the chaos in which he resides, given by Joseph Fiennes), create a perfect balance at the center of this legend.  No other filming of this story has brought with it a sense of how things were when this tale was evolving. It is a brash, non-nonsense telling.",1367712000,5,1003,4.603351955307263
4403152,4,B004LROMSY,"The main character looks like a surfer boy rather than a knight capable of wielding a sword like Excalibur and killing multible enemies in battle, some wearing armor and familiar with battle. But the reason I give it 4 stars is that all the other characters played their parts well, as another excellent fellow said previously. The upside is that you see good and evil being contested in unorthadox style and lots of actions, interesting characters and realistic scenery, not CGI in most cases, accurate depictions of weapons at the time, good film making and cimeatography. The downside is that it ends uncomplete and since no second season was made the fans and avid viewers are left hanging. It's no way to end a series that had so much promise. And the last two episodes pretty much suck compared to the rest.",1367625600,,813,4.732394366197183

4403156,3,B004LROMSY,"This show wasn't bad, and it's a shame that it was canceled so early because it had potential. The cast in this show was pretty good, with the exception of the main character. Jamie Campbell Bower doesn't cut it as Arthur. I thought his acting was weak and he seemed like a child, this might have been somewhat a result of the writing, but that doesn't make the show any better.

The writing in much of the show was your usual recycled concepts throughout much of the series, but towards the end it got a bit better.",1362528000,,516,4.319587628865979

I will not repeat what other negative reviewers have said, they are all correct especially with regards to Arthur's character - my 6 year old daughter is more masculine than this guy.

I'm deducting a few points off for that evil criminal Merlin and dishonourable childish King Arthur. Down with both of them! Their actions make this series drag on like a British soap opera!

If not for Eva Green as Lady Morgan to focus on, I would not have paid any attention to ""Camelot""!

I'm marching off with Eva Green.... I mean, Lady Morgan! ;-P

It was not even close to the anything like the legend, I guess the names were the same, that's the only nice thing I can say.",1361577600,11,465,4.0989010989010985
4403161,2,B004LROMSY,"On the surface, it seemed like a great idea: an adult retelling of the Arthurian legends, with a cast of great actors, a huge budget and an attempt to deconstruct the familiar stories surrounding King Arthur and his court. But for a number of reasons ""Camelot"" didn't deliver.

When King Uther dies, a power vacuum opens in his wake, out of which emerge two contenders to the throne: his legitimate daughter Morgan, who was taken from her home after her mother's death and sent to a convent, and his bastard son Arthur, conceived before marriage on Uther's second wife Igraine and fostered out in secret to a humble peasant family.

Both of them have a claim to the kingdom, but extreme sibling rivalry ensues when Morgan decides the crown is hers alone. In Arthur's corner is the sorcerer Merlin, a manipulative trickster who has a number of ploys designed to strengthen Arthur's reputation among the people, though they're constantly hindered by Arthur himself, who often seems more interested in pursuing ladies than ruling a kingdom. On Morgan's side is her own wit, cunning and ever-growing magical powers. As she moves from one scheme to the next in her attempt to displace her brother, she calls upon darker and more dangerous magic in order to consolidate her claim to the throne - magic which takes its toll on her.

It all seems a brilliant set-up, in which the writers propose to deconstruct the ideals that we associate with Arthurian legend and put a fresh spin on the well-known story. The show not only demythologizing elements such as the Sword in the Stone, the Lady of the Lake and the Round Table, but also tears apart the heroic image we have of so many iconic characters. This unfortunately, is where it goes wrong.

In their attempt to play around with the archetypal notion we have of King Arthur, they end up characterizing him as a whiny, horny, gormless, deceitful creep - whilst still expecting us to root for him as the show's protagonist. His very first scene portrays him having sex with his brother's girlfriend in broad daylight in an open field (and being completely unrepentant about it afterwards) and later on he sets his sights on the fiance (then wife) of his most loyal knight. He trusts the wrong people, he makes dumb decisions, he throws temper tantrums, and at all times he seems completely over his head.

Meanwhile Morgan, despite several questionable moral shortcomings, actually seems more suited to ruling than her brother - she's certainly more invested in the crown, eager to win the people's approval and aware of the responsibility of ruling. Watching her wiles and manipulations are perhaps the most enjoyable part of the entire show, helped along by the relish and charisma with which Eva Green plays her part.

The writers decide to invert the famous Arthurian love triangle by having Guinevere married to a knight called Leontes and portray Arthur as the interloper. Not a bad idea, but it's handled terribly. The show would have us believe that Arthur and Guinevere yearn for each other with a passion that cannot possibly be denied - even though their interaction consists of two short conversations and a dream. They then have sex in a cave on the very morning that Guinevere is to be married to another man, and after she goes through with the wedding, Arthur pushes her up against a wall and demands to know whether her new husband is better in bed than he is. Wow, how romantic. What woman wouldn't fall for a guy like that?

Now, a protagonist doesn't always have to be likeable - heck, sometimes they can be downright villainous. But to characterize Arthur in this way whilst still expecting the audience to buy him as a sympathetic hero just doesn't work, and despite the inordinate amount of time spent on it, his ""great love"" for Guinevere is about as deep as a paddling pool. You've heard of the saying ""show, don't tell"", right? Well, this show hasn't.

Though the production values are high, and everything looks very sleek and glossy, the scripts leave a lot to be desired, with plot holes galore (Morgan kills her father by poisoning a communal bowl - so how come no one else died? And how could she be sure he would eat from it? That's in just the first five minutes of the very first episode) and plenty of clichd and/or banal dialogue. When Arthur expresses his misgivings to Merlin, asking: ""What if they don't accept me?"" Merlin's reply is: ""They must."" Wow, that's helpful. Later, Arthur says much the same thing to Leontes, and is told: ""Trust your instincts."" ""What if I don't have the instincts of a king?"" ""Perhaps you do and you just don't know it."" Great advice.

Likewise, there is a clumsy attempt to blend gritty realism with contemporary values, which means that alongside gory fight scenes and explicit sex scenes, we have Guinevere spouting modern rhetoric, such as: ""I'm not sure what love means,"" and Arthur declaring that his kingdom stands for nebulous concepts such as ""freedom for all"" and that ""no one belongs to anyone"", principals which would have been incomprehensible to people in the Middle Ages, and which to sound trite to contemporary ears. The show could have picked one or the other, but having the characters pay lip-service to modern ideals whilst getting up to some extremely sordid behavior results in a completely garbled tone. We end up with a show as anachronistic as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B003TY2SUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B001LF347E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>, but without the tongue-in-cheek winks to the audience. Camelot wants to be taken seriously, whilst simultaneously being remarkably silly.

(And for the record, throwing in a few gratuitous sex and nude scenes doesn't make a show more mature, darker, or richer. In this case, it has quite the opposite effect: of people trying too hard to seem grown-up. Some of the shots are downright funny, such as Guinevere rising from the ocean in a sheer wet dress, revolving slowly so the camera can get a good look at her backside *and* her breasts).

The episodes just sort of meander along without any real sense of forward momentum (some of the more pointless subplots include the knights bringing books from a hidden library back to Camelot, Guinevere going to visit her dying father, and Leontes/Morgan having some sort of weird encounter with a magical wolf in the forest that is never explained) and by the end of the series we're left with a cliff-hanger that will never be resolved thanks to the show's imminent cancellation.

There are some good performances here and there - the aforementioned Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes who hams it up as Merlin. Peter Mooney is an appealing Kay (you'll be left wondering why *he* wasn't crowned king instead of his brother) and several original characters such as Sybil the mysterious nun and Bridget the sensible handmaiden have intriguing dynamics with main characters that should have been fleshed-out better. I was initially intrigued by the presence of Claire Forlaini as Arthur's mother Igraine considering almost all versions of Arthurian legend have her die in childbirth - but these writers don't bother to explore her relationship with her long-lost son at all.

In short, it was a good idea that simply wasn't executed properly. The wrong characters are unlikeable, the dialogue doesn't sound natural, the plot doesn't go anywhere until the last two episodes, Arthur and Guinevere look (and sound) far too modern, and much of the stuff that happens simply doesn't make sense. Despite the liberal ideals that the show espouses, the women are ogled by the cameras in the sleaziest way possible, and Arthur's single black knight is naturally the first to be killed off in battle (and nobody even bothers to take his body back to Camelot or even give him proper burial).

Arthur's characterization could have worked if the writers had been aware of it; if say Arthur was *meant* to be a loathsome brat that Merlin was struggling to portray in a positive light for the sake of public relations, with Morgan doing her best to expose her half-brother for his true self. With Merlin and Morgan as the real protagonists, the deconstruction of the legends could have been focused on their fight over this pawn and their attempt to gain control of the kingdom from behind the throne.

As it is, the show attempts to have its cake and eat it too. I'd suggest giving this one a miss.",1360972800,2,8597,4.981184668989547

I love Arthurian themed tv and movies and the castles & village sets seemed so much more authentic to the era.

Arthur starts off as this skinny kid with no regard for Guenevere's relationship  and the actor seemed positively wrong for the roll. He started evolving into a man and king and a 2nd season would have developed his character much further, stronger and better.  Merlin was magnificent. An entirely different yet fully workable & fascinating spin on the man.  I was sorry to see a few of the characters killed off in the first season, I think they were rich for more storytelling.

My chief complaint about the show is the cinematography; the use of a ""shaky-cam"" technique here and there makes it feel as if the scene is being shot on someone's HD pocket video camera.  It's distracting, ruining the suspension of disbelief, and pulling the viewer out of ancient times and back to 2013.

4403166,4,B004LROMSY,"This was a great series that was unfortunately cancelled after the first season.  Don't let that stop you from watching it.  It's quite well done.  The sets, costumes, script and actors are all top notch.  The production quality is very high.  While the ratings weren't bad for the show, I believe it was cancelled for two reasons:  1.)  Period dramas are VERY expensive to produce.  Showtime was struggling in the last two seasons of The Tudors just to continue the series' budget.  So, I can imagine what Starz was paying for this per episode.  2.)  This good show had the misfortune of premiering in the exact same season as the MUCH inferior, Game of Thrones on HBO, which seemed to steal it's thunder.

Even so, I highly recommend this series, especially if you enjoyed The Tudors.  I could tell immediately from the production values, style of the presentation and even the writing that someone from The Tudors had to be involved with this production.  In fact, they are.  Michael Hirst, who created and executive produced The Tudors does so here.  The look and feel is very much the same.  Even the casting personnel are the same.

Eva Green is fantastic as Morgan Le Fey as is most everyone else.  My only two gripes are unfortunately actors in the two biggest parts.  Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur is just okay.  I realize Arthur is a reluctant boy-King, but they really needed to get someone with more GRAVITAS, especially when Arthur assumes the throne and really needs to display some balls.  The entire show revolves around him.  Someone like Jonathan Rhys Myers could carry the Tudors.  Bower can't do the same for Camelot.  Joseph Fiennes, as Merlin is strangely irritating.  For nearly the first entire season, he wears the SAME scowl on his face.  It NEVER changes.  His performance isn't okay.  It's disappointing.  I was surprised because he's a very good actor...just not in this part...in my opinion.  Who knows how he would have evolved it over the course of 3-4 seasons.  We'll never know, but in this season...Merlin has a stick up his butt the entire time making him very, very unlikable.

I find little sense in reviews complaining that Camelot is ""PC""...Is Colin Morgan's portrayal of Merlin in ""Merlin"" rubbish because it lacks a politically incorrect world? Yes, Game of Thrones is fantastic, but not everything needs to be covered in blood and harlots. This is FICTION, not a documentary!

4403187,4,B004LROMSY,"*Two very mild spoilers below*

You must understand, I am a big history buff. So when a friend and I went to the theater some time ago and I saw the trailer for this, I was both elated and saddened (as I don't have Starz.) When I learned that the brilliant mind that helped craft The Tudors, another of my favorite (albeit historically innacurate) series, I was on board, one hundred percent. And while I may have had to wait for streams to go up online to see it, you better believe I was waiting eagerly in front of my computer screen every weekend.

The basic tale of King Arthur is known by all, so no need to repeat that. Here, King Uther has recently died, and his quick witted daughter Morgan sees this as her perfect opportunity to claim the throne she has so long coveted. Merlin, however, has something else in mind. Arthur, having been raised in the countryside unaware of his parentage, is quite surprised to find the sorcerer in his home spewing tales of being the son of a king. Merlin sees a future in this boy, a way to mend a country torn apart by warlord kings, and it will all start in one place, a crumbling stronghold that will stand as a beacon for a new era: Camelot.

It's pretty much common knowledge that a lot of peopele don't like this series. Even as a fan, I admit there is some to be desired, and certain things could have gone better. But there is still a lot to appreciate.

A big sore spot for a lot of people is the casting of Jamie Campbell Bower as the well known king. While yes, I'm sure someone out there could have carried the role better, this choice wasn't a horrible one. This Arthur is not the one we tend to immediately think of. This is a young, aloof Arthur, who doesn't know a damn thing about being king, and would frankly rather be at home with his foster family than thrust into the middle of medieval politics. Even halfway through the series, he's still coming into his own. Had the series continued, I feel like we'd have gotten to see different sides of him, and see him grow.

There are, as to be expected, historical innacuracies. This is a medieval show, after all, and sometimes that is forgotten. A previous reviewer mentioned the episode where a young girl is nearly forced to offer up her virginity as compensation for the land she and her father live on. And they were right; in a teeny tiny medieval settlement like this town, this is commonplace. Even far after this time period, landowners were able require women's virginities as payment from those beneath them, and there was no denying a person who was above you in station. This is given a modern treatment of ""ohhh, that poor sweet child shouldn't have to give up her virginity to the big bad man"", and while in the end it turns out it is mostly because the two are secretly related, it still is something that would probably have never come to light in real life. Now, in the show's defense, as I said, this is a young Arthur, one who would probably still believe in childish idealism and who would undoubtedly take trouble with this sort of thing. On a completely different note, something that really irritated me is the big boo-boo that is Morgan's parentage. Morgan is the child of Igraine and the Duke of Cornwall, along with her sister Morgause. She is NOT a Pendragon.

Despite the ups and downs, there are two shining gems that really make this show: Eva Green as Morgan, and Joseph Fiennes as Merlin. Firstly, this is a different Merlin than the wizened, bearded figure everybody imagines. This is a dark, brooding Merlin, one whose past is filled with sins and who may not be all that sane. The series seems to hint that the reason he hides his power is that it once got out of hand and killed his family, but this was never cleared up before the cancelation. Then, of course, my favorite part of the series, the goddess that is Eva Green. Not only is she stunningly beautiful, but she pulls off the role of cold, calculating enchantress like she was born for it.

Really, I think that Camelot had many chips and cracks, but with a little patching up (that is, to say, more seasons) it could have had a lot of success. Every show starts off with baby steps, this one just never had a chance to work on its toddler years, so to speak.",1354665600,45,4266,4.412960609911055

But when I had the chance to sit down with the DVD and watch the entire season, I admit that I was drawn into the story and found it to not be quite as bad as I anticipated (although that does not mean I would describe it as ""good"").

The costumes and scenery are outstanding. I love the lavish sets and the gorgeous costumes. The writing...well, the writing comes off as something a young screenwriter might produce. The dialog is often forced and the characters use phrases that I am pretty sure were not in existence before, say, 1990. But Eva Green as Morgan is stunning. Green is beautiful and really manages to pull off the air of evil and vengeance. My eyes were glued to her whenever she was on screen. Joseph Fiennes is probably wasted in the role of Merlin. He chews the scenery and I wondered if he ended up in this role because he owed someone a favor. Jamie Campbell Bower never grew on me as Arthur. He just simply does not have the physical presence to play the king that would unite Camelot. He looks like a spoiled surfer boy who doesn't quite know what he is supposed to do next. I think the most annoying character for me was Tamsin Egerton's Guinevere; the character is woefully poorly written and has little to do either than look forelornly into the distance, rail against Arthur for some slight, or prance around nude. Depending on what you are in the mood for, this might just be the ticket though.

Still, I give this season 3 stars because it did pull me in after all, which surprised me. I actually am somewhat disappointed that Starz did not order another season of the series because I would watch just to see what happens with Morgan.

The fantasy stuff was silly, the romantic scenes were silly.

4403207,4,B004LROMSY,"I've been a fan of King Arthur since reading The Once and Future King (T.H. White) decades ago in high school, and have read many, many books both famous and obscure on the subject.  As has been noted, there have been many film versions of the Matter of Britain, some definitely better than others.

This year for my birthday, I decided to treat myself to this box set.  I admit the first episode did alarm me a tad with the amount of bare skin and sex featured.  I hoped the show wasn't going to rely extensively on these elements to tell its story.  This, however, died down by Ep 2 and IMO this series got better and better as it progressed.  By the last couple of eps, I was hooked entirely and severely disappointed to learn that there would be no second season!

I really enjoyed Jamie Campbell Bower as young Arthur, and Morgan as played by Eva Green--well, she was beyond compare.  It was great to see a Morgan who was truly wicked yet whose wickedness was understandable considering her motivation and background.  It may not have been right that I was rooting for her to win by the end!  But to my mind, Arthur as a character (not to mention Guinevere as a character) was weakened by his involvement in the Arthur/Guinevere/Leontes triangle, which did neither Arthur nor Guinevere any favors and gave each of them a premature history of deception and infidelity long before the expected (and traditional) Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot triangle.  Why dilute that dynamic with a ""trial run""?  I am aware that ""triangles"" are frequent items in modern tv drama and often done to death.  But I found myself getting very impatient with this one, and now when I rewatch, I fast-forward through almost all the Arthur & Guinevere scenes.  The nature of their relationship in this version dragged both of them down.

I also liked the way this series hinted at Morgan's nunnery ""education,"" mentioned by Sir Thomas Malory in the first pages of the Morte d'Arthur.  Sinead Cusack's Sybil was an intriguing original character, and to those who have commented that Vivien was undeveloped, well, I'm sure the show was intending to do more with her as things progressed.  It seems to be the trend more often than not lately to make Morgan the daughter rather than the step-daughter of Uther Pendragon, and, considering the way Uther is portrayed in this version, you can't blame her much for bumping him off.  Igraine--well, the way she was portrayed, I came away feeling that Morgan's reaction to her (although perhaps not the murder!) was more justified than not.  Igraine may have been Arthur's mother, but she seemed pretty ineffectual throughout, and her eleventh-hour claim that she'd saved Morgan's life when Uther wanted to kill her just rang sort of flat.

This was also the first role I've ever genuinely enjoyed Joseph Fiennes in, even if, as my daughter said, ""This Merlin isn't very 'magical,' is he?"" :)

At the end of the day, for me, it's All About Morgan.  Kudos to Eva Green on a great & complex acting feat of being fascinatingly evil and yet sympathetic, but not too much so due to the choices she made.  I'm not sure if those in charge intended her to be as sympathetic as I perceived her to be, or for the ""Camelot"" people besides Arthur to be so dull, but IMO the ""Camelot"" residents were pallid in comparison, though Leontes was an effective (largely original) character despite being pivotal in the ""triangle.""",1340150400,,3425,4.728956228956229

4403211,4,B004LROMSY,"If you have any interest in the tales of King Arthur, it is hard to ignore the wonderful BBC series Merlin.  It is also hard to avoid comparing Merlin with Camelot, but the two series could not be more different.  Where Merlin is a Smallville version of the King Arthur tale, Camelot is a darker, non-humorous take on the ascent of the young king.  In Camelot, Arthur is a bit of a lay about, not really going anywhere in life, until he finds out he is actually the son of the dying king.  He isn't ready (who would be?) but he must rise to the occasion.  He is ably assisted by the wizard Merlin, played so well by Joseph Fiennes.  Arthur himself is played for the obvious teen heartthrob vibe, but he starts to grow on you as he himself grows.  The skeleton of the story is familiar, as it must be, but there are sufficient twists to keep you interested.

Now, the only downside to this version is its network.  Since this is running on Starz, rather than network or basic cable, there is an imperative to throw in irrelevant nudity and gore.  It would be improved by an adult presence in the production staff reining in the ""edginess"" just to make it suitable for premium cable.

STARZ's Camelot takes this into account tells a gritty version of king Arthur that's not epic or heroic (at least not in the typical way).  chivalry does not come easy to anyone and Arthur truly is just a boy manipulated by Merlin into a role that he may not be suited for.  It truly sucks that this show got cancelled but i guess if your going to label it Camelot, expect most intelligent fans not to give it a chance and the D&D nerds to get pissy because there are no hobbits.  the scene when Merlin gets Excalibur and then relays the story to the knights is the best example of how great this show could have been.",1335830400,2,881,4.380368098159509
4403224,4,B004LROMSY,"After initially making the mistake of shying away form Spartacus on Starz for a long time thinking it would be a poor man's 300 and of course being absolutely wrong, I chose to give this Starz take on Camelot a try.

From the beginning the production values are better than regular tv but not quite as epic as game of thrones and I could see how some could be put off by that but as the series progresses; the characters progress very well really drawing you into the series. Their take on mythical characters was refreshing and definitely more realistic. Perhaps the biggest attraction is Merlin played by Joseph Fiennes. This is no standard Merlin for sure. Completely different ""bad ass"" type of Merlin with shaved head, tattoos and cryptic scars all over his body, Fiennes does what he does so well and creates and anti-hero type Merlin. This character is not alone in redefining the mythos of Camelot... King Arthur played by Jamie Campbell does a marvelous job at seeming meek and confused but as the series progresses he manages to play a convincingly heroic Arthur by the end of season. Morgan played by Eva Green was also done quite well. How do I know this? Because though she is amazingly beautiful, you manage to hate her guts as the season progresses. Gawain is an awesome double sward weilding soldier who trains Arthurs knights, Lancelot known as Leontis is probably the only character along with Gawain not straying from the original legend. Leontis tried, true and faithful to his kings oozes nobility loyalty. I can go on and on about all the characters and initially maybe because of ingrained stereo types of Camelot, you are put off by the characters but if you stick to the series, I guarantee you will grow to appreciate them as the spirit of Camelot with twist of reality.

Magic is touched on in this series but it is not overt and quite rare. Most of the magic is performed by Morgan but Merlin intentionally does not flaunt or practice because his power is too great to control and addicting so he represses himself but when he does use magic, it is truly powerful sometimes with dire consequences. Morgan also suffers more for this for her constant use of it. Battles are not epic like game of thrones, as a matter of fact battles are quite small with maybe 40 men in the field, and it can become off putting as it seems unrealistic that a kingdom could only be comprised of such small armies. I have to think it was simply budgetary constraints. For what ever reason, Camelot was just not hit like Spartacus was and starz seemed to give up on it. A real shame because it was a refreshing take on myth and the actors were superb with flashes of brilliant acting at times.

I enjoyed the series and loved the characters. If you decide to watch the series, give it some time, don't give up on it and it will reward you with some great acting and transformations at the end of the season.",1333065600,,2913,4.555343511450381
4403225,2,B004LROMSY,"I have never really found a version of the King Arthur legend that I preferred to any other. I had semi high hopes for this series but it never quite worked for me.

Banished in the wake of her father's marriage to a new queen, Morgan le Fay (Eva Green) is determined to reclaim the throne. Hoping her father will take her back after their estrangement, she gives him one last chance to redeem his previous bad behavior and return her to the line of his succession. At his adamant refusal, she brings about his death and casts his wife, Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani), from the castle. With the kingdom at peril and concerns high over whether or not a woman can lead, she knows her first responsibility must be to form an alliance with her father's mortal enemy, Lord Lot (James Purefoy). Intrigued at her proposition that they rule side by side, he agrees to help her defend Camelot against potential usurpers, not realizing there is another claimant to the throne.

Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower) has no knowledge of his royal ancestry and lives a simple life in the country, constantly teasing his elder brother by stealing all the best women right out from under his nose and pleasantly troubled by dreams of a beautiful woman (Tamsin Egerton). Then a mysterious and slightly sinister man appears on the doorstep of the family hovel and informs him that he is the illegitimate heir of King Uthur. Since the day he helped bring Arthur into the world, Merlin (Joseph Fienness) has not touched magic again. But he will need to learn to master it if it he is to defeat Morgan, assist Arthur in climbing a mountain to draw the sword from the stone, and make certain Camelot rises again...

This cable station has a history of putting controversial content ahead of scripting and while Camelot does suffer from being pointlessly gratuitous, the script is surprisingly solid and the characters are interesting, Merlin most of all as we attempt to discern his motivations and understand his reservations about magic. Fiennes has an excellent grasp on him that makes him likable but also a little sinister and his scenes are among the finest, but it is Eva Green who wins the day with her empathetic but dark Morgan. I know she's supposed to be the villain but I liked her, far more than I probably should. The real problem here is Arthur. I had  hard time liking him and when you're actually rooting for his sister to take the kingdom that shows something is wrong. The writing struggles from being a tad formulaic at times but there are some excellent twists and turns, as well as unusual takes on various legends. (How Merlin comes by Excalibur is chilling and haunting both, as well as their approach to the Lady of the Lake.) The costuming is adequate and imaginative and the setting and backdrop breathtaking (it was filmed in Ireland).

In some regards this series is quite good and in others it fails miserably, mostly because a lot of people dislike the actor who plays Arthur. I never minded him so much as I disliked the figure of Arthur -- he is something of a hypocrite and completely selfish, but does gradually begin to mature as the series unfolds. The manner in which the audience comes to know Morgan is a good one (we never know from one episode to the next whether to hate her or have pity for her) and Merlin is perhaps one of the greatest, most ambiguous depictions of the character in recent film. Alas, Starz' emphasis on turning the story into a soft-core porn romp leaves much to be desired.",1332892800,2,3511,4.638263665594855

Historically speaking, some people may be surprised to know that the myth of Arthur first came about right around the end of the Roman occupation;  the jousts, glistening armor & all the stuff the readers of Thomas Mallory are familiar with came way, WAY later.

Now to the present rendition of the Arthurian legend:  we get an Arthur who is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky womanizing youth who has the throne thrust upon him by the mysterious sorcerer Merlin.  He spends his time convincing people that he has the goods to be their leader and he finds himself in a huge power struggle with his half sister, Morgana, to build his nascent kingdom.

2nd Note: I saw all the episodes with XFinity On Demand.

SPOILERS!!!

This series is intriguing for several reasons. I. It's the story of King Arthur as you've never seen it before, II. It stars Joseph Fiennes (""Shakespeare In Love"") as Merlin, Eva Green (""The Dreamers"") as Morgan, Jamie Campbell-Bower as Arthur and Claire Forlani (""The Rock"") as Igraine and III. It has violence, sex and sorcery (but not the kind we're used to reading about in Le Morte D'Arthur and seeing in John Boorman's interesting, but very freely adapted film version of the classic story by Sir Thomas Malory, ""Excalibur."")

Like ""Excalibur,"" this series departs radically from the well-known version of the legend, as told in Le Morte D'Arthur written by Sir Thomas Malory and published by William Caxton in 1485. An example: Arthur is a good-looking womanizer. I've no problem with Arthur being handsome, it's just his depiction as a womanizer. It doesn't go with the story, as Sir Ector was a knight and therefore skilled in courtly behaviour and against using women for sex, which is something only a base person and no true knight, much less a true king, would have done. Though Sir Ector tells Arthur not to use his anatomy and always to use his mind & heart when making decisions, it falls flat based on the opening scene. Arthur is nothing like his father Uther in the legend as told by Sir Thomas Malory, whereas here he is exactly like his father, seducing Guinevere even though she is betrothed to another (and it is NOT an illicit affair with Sir Lancelot this time around, either). That's my main issue: Arthur depicted as a womanizer. Also, the dark sorcery which borders strongly on satanic worship is a problem for me. In the legend, the magic does not even approach satanic worship, nor are pentagrams ever mentioned. The acting is great.

Final analysis: Interesting series, but Arthur as a womanizer and the dark sorcery are huge minuses.

It's a shame that the series has been cancelled, as it ends on a cliff-hanger. I hate it when they do that to a series, cancelling it despite strong ratings and or a great storyline. My reservations of this show aside, it's really good.",1327536000,,2323,4.780548628428928
4403237,3,B004LROMSY,"Starz gained alot of creds with Sparticus and so they wanted to creat another series. this a result, based on the Arthurian legend. which in the end I find to be a bit of a mixed bag. (Beware Spoilers to follow.)

First off I am an avid reader of Arthuiran fiction. I've read Malory, Geoffery, Chretien, and others. I've seen the Arthurian based movies and series. (And written reviews on them. see my page). And I know that NO movie is going to be totaly close to the legend. there are some good versions but some just don't entirly capture the feel. there has been a definitive Robin Hood (Flynn), but not a definitive Arthur movie. there are good ones though. Point is I don't entirly expect this to be totaly close to the legend. which is not a bad thing, but something like this should have the essence of the subject matter. this has the elements and a few twists. some may claim that there is a bit of modern 'political correctness'. Maybe there is but thats nothing new. Its also not so 'modern'. esspessily to Arthurian fiction. one need simply read Chretien to know that. (And lets not forget his patron was the daughter of one of the most powerful of women in the Midevil period). There are other examples as well of strong women in Arthurian fiction. Look at the 'Wedding of Gawain', Malory's story of Sir Gareth would be nothing without the strong willed Linet, and so on.

That is not to say this series has its faults. it does. for various reasons. before I get to that let me speak of the actors.
At the top of the list is Joseph Fiennes as Merlin, Eva Green as Morgan, and Sinead Cusack as Sybil. these are by far the best of the cast meambers and really make the series. if you watch it then watch it for no other reason then these actors. Then there is Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur. at first he seems a bit of a fop, dishonorable, and unfit. yet as the sereies progresses his charture changes. for the better. he becomes the Arthur of legend. And maybe that's the point. that he starts out as reckless but becomes the hero he needs to be. still Fiennes excells as Merlin. he's clearly mad, not allways trust worthy, but loyal to the ideal of Camelot. Green is bitter, cunning, and strong willed. Cusack is another treat. her charture cares for Morgan as much as Merlin cares for Arthur. she is also intelligent and cunning. these main actors are what carry the series and are fun to watch. the others do a decent job, but some let the side down just a bit.

Ultimatly in the end I can only reivew this series episode by episode. Because they have their good and bad points. I just cant review the series as a whole because of the jumble we get here. partly because of the writers, and other reasons.

-Homecoming- Uther is slain, Morgan lusts for power and allies herself with Lot, and Merlin seeks out Arthur and tells him his true hertige. This episode has a lot of potential. some things are rather contrived. (It seems to quick for some of the knights to automaticly pledge their alleigance to Arthur.) Yet there is still the potential. Merlin has the dream of Camelot. he hopes Arthur will forfill this dream, and Arthur could become the king of legend, but there is a chance he wont. there is the possiblity he will fail. This is something I found to be interesting and they really could have worked on this angle a bit more. Arthur at first seems a typical reckless youth. he beds whatever woman he can get his hands on. he is awed and bewildered by what has been cast upon him. he dosent interly understand it all. yet he wants to do what is right. I think what lets the side down a bit is James Purefoy as Lot. He's not a bad actor. it's just his charture seems to familur to other roles he's played. his Lot is no different then Anthony in Rome for example. This is porbably my main complaint for this episode.

-The Sword and the Crown- Arthur meets Guinevere, who he's been having dreams about. Morgan and Lot attack but Lot is defeated. Arthur claims the sword from the stone. Another good starter episode. the new telling of the sword in stone story is interesting and inventive. I also like that there are hints that Merlin set up this whole thing. Purefoy again lets the side down a bit again, but his charture meets his fate in the end. he beats Morgan, but is himself destroyed by Arthur. (Allthough you get the sense that if he had not lost to Arthur he would not have outlived Morgan). the highlight is really how Arthur is achiveing his inhertiance and Merlin's aid in this matter. Both Kay and Arthur have lost their only family to Lot. this angle could have been played up a bit more, as its a bit hard to really feel for the chatures.

-Guinevere-These next two episodes I admit are not the best written. Leontes is one of the knights who serves Arthur. Kay and leontes seek out Gawain to come to Camelot, he reluctantly agrees. Arthur and Merlin are invited to feast with Morgan, which they do. merlin is himself taken prisoner. guinevere and Leontes are to be married but Arthur lusts after her. he wishes to be with her before her wedding. the twist here with Guinevere is that she is betrothed to Leontes, who himself willing serves Arthur. (This is all a whole twist on the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot relationship). Morgan menwhile is using magic and it is costing her. the first thing I didn't care for is that Merlin and Arthur go to see Morgan without guards and are rather brazen. there seemed no good reason for this thinking. it was silly. of course they would be traped and tricked. aparently Arthur is just that blind about Morgan. aslo it is hard to see Arthur act in such a dishonrable manner. (and I see others think so too). He surrenders to his lust and risks everything. it didn't seem right.

-Lady of the Lake- Arthur's sword is broken. Merlin seeks a new one from the swordmaker Caliburn, who wants to kill Arthur. his daughter, Excalibur, takes the sword but dies by accident in a lake. Merlin takes the sword from her dead hand. Arthur is upset that he cant be with Guinevere but she inspires him to do change things. While Morgan is ill there enters a nun, Syble (Cusack) who aids her. Again this is a weak episode. Caliburn's motives are rather murcky and it would have been nice if they were fleshed out. we need to know why he wants Arthur dead. it would have made the tragidy of his dauther's death more meaningful. however, I like Merlin's deceptive way of relating how he got the sword and establishes the legend. Arthur again isn't acting his best here. the highlight however is the introduction of Syble. it may be tempting for some viewers to give up at this point. I see some have, and I was almost tempted to as well. I encourage you to hang in there, the series improves.

-Justice- Arthur and his knights look into a murder charge and they hold a trial, while Morgan minpulates merchants to come to her side. this is by far the better of episodes. this is where things start to improve and get better. here Arthur is acting as he should, as a man of honor. he is the Arthur of legend here. a man of the people who wants to improve his lands. yet at the same time Morgan uses cunning to change peoples minds using 'justice' to her own ends. Arthur uses justice to give hope. Morgan uses it to establish fear. this is a rather nice parrallel. this is one of my favorite episodes and agian its when things realy make their turning point. Arthur sees his own faults and sees he must do better. not only for himself but to others. I rather enjoyed this episode.

-Three Journeys-Guinever travels to see her dying father, Arthur goes with her. Kay, Merlin, and some of the knights travel to Kay's home for a libary. A nun come to see Morgan telling her how Syble had burned down the nunnery. this is a rather interesting episode with different storys going on at once. on the one hand we have guinevere dealing with her father's death, the guilt for her actions, but her genuin love for Arthur. Arthur also loves her and is also guiltful. Kay is reluctant to go back home, but in the end finds beloved memorys of the past. merlin is incouraged to use magic rather then not use it. morgan is torn between admistering justice in front of everyone or punishing Syble, whome she cares for. it is another well written episode. I liked the mutliple storys going on and the chature devlopment.

-The Long Night- Arthur and his court spends the night at Morgan's castle. she has various entertainments and stages a fake attack. at least time Arthur was smarter when visiting his sister. Merlin genuinly wants to go just for the sake of knowing what Morgan is planning. its interesting to see the 'staged' attack and how it effects the knights. Arthur genuinly believes it is real and wants to protect Morgan. all the while Morgan is discovering out the secrets of Camelot. in particular what happend with Arthur and Guinevere. its a nice little 'misleading' episode. at the end Igraine is taken prisoner and Morgan has taken her shape.

-Igraine- As Igraine Morgan infiltrates Camelot. she seduces Merlin, exposes Guinevere, and all the while meets Igraine's friend a small orphined boy, Redwald. Igraine in the meantime uses all her wiles to escape and return to Camelot. Redwald is a nice chature a young dreamer. yet he sees Morgan's true self and by accident is killed. (those who don't like to see children harmed may not care for this episode.) It seems Morgan is genuinly affected by the boy, but the final scean shows her true colors. its a rather well written episode. showing how Igraine is and how Morgan precieves her. how Merlin cares for her and how he feels he is dangerous when people get to close to him. we see how a servant of Morgan is twisted in that love and convinced to stage an attack at the Bardon Pass. Vivian, Morgan's servant, however questions her misteresses actions. Syble however willing does all she hast to all for Morgan's sake. even though Green is not shown, her pressence is felt.

-The Battle of Bardon Pass- (Bardon seems to me to be a refrence to the Battle of Badon, one of Arthur's well known victorys.) Morgan's troops attack the pass, Arthur and his men ride to defend the pass. Merlin finds out what Morgan has done, he and Igraine ride off to confront her, but are captured. Leontes in the meantime confronts both Guinever and Arthur. in the end it is Arthur alone who is left at the pass. This is a good episode. the only bit that lets the side down is Merlin and Igraine ridding off to confront Morgan. this seemed rather silly, and doomed to fail. the other bits were good. how the guilt of Arthur is exposed and how it effects the men. the battle sceans are well done. In the meantime Morgan is closer to achieving her goals.

-Reckoning-Arthur alone defends the pass, it is believed he is slain. Morgan claims the crown. Leontes and the men return to aid Arthur, Leontes is slain. Arthur confronts Morgan. Syble takes the blame for all, and is executed. Morgan is left alone. Arthur and his men decide to honor Leontes and to achieve the goal that they set out to do. to creat a Camelot worthy of legend. Igraine in the meantime has been slain by Morgan and Merlin decides to leave. he sees that Arthur no longer needs him. this is the culmination of the series. we see that Arthur is becoming the man of legend, the man he was meant to be. it is fun to see him fight alone against so many. peace is gained between him and Leontes. all seems to be set to rights in Camelot. Arthur shows how he wants to give people peace, while Morgan gave them fear. he becomes the man the people and the land need. we see that he shall set up the legend that we all know. we even see the Round Table begining to be set up. Morgan, however, has taken Guinevere's shape and seduces Arthur. she departs, no dought to birth Mordred.

So agian, in the end this is a bit of a mixed series. its not toatly bad, it just could have used more work in some areas. some things were well done, others could have been worked out better. there were parts that were not so well written that could have imporved. its all a jumble.
over all Id say its a decent series. good. not terrible. but good. if you are interested give it a chance. it has potential.

sadly this series lasted only one season. it was canceled for various reasons and there will be no second series.
which is a pity. a few better episodes really could have helped this series.

4403238,3,B004LROMSY,"I was looking forward to this series after I saw the trailer because it looked promising.  I like stories about Merlin and King Arthur, etc.  I thought it started out great, but became a little too melodramatic as the episodes went on.  The story differs from the one most of us know.  Some things are the same as in the legend, but they changed other parts of the story.  For example, the character of Merlin is completely different from any I've known.  Joseph Fiennes does a wonderful job playing the part.  His character is intense and tortured, not like the Merlin with the grey hair and the wizard's beard, lol.  I thought Fiennes really stole the show.  It's only my opinion, but the first thing that bothered me was the casting of Guenivere.  To me, the actress who portrayed her looked like a twenty first century super model wearing a medieval costume.  I'm not suggesting that her acting ability is lacking, but I couldn't buy her as Guinevere at all. But that's just my humble opinion, of course.  I won't go on and on about the plot, etc.  I didn't totally dislike the series, but didn't love it either.  I would have probably watched a second season, but there will be none.

But then niether are the written tales of king Author! The real one was a warlord in Britain who was defending the british against the invading anglo saxons and engles. At least the time period is right, it's taking place in the early 500's or late 400's A.D.  The show is mainly a drama and it's budget precludes any big battles. BUt then even the excellent 'game of thrones' doesn't have big battles in it! The story mainly revolves around King Author and his love affair with gwen. Merlin is depicted as more bloodthirsty than usual in this one and that may make people unhappy. It's a decent show though and it should have gotten a chance for a second season.

4403241,3,B004LROMSY,"Starz attempts to turn the sturdy legend of King Arthur into a sexy nighttime soap opera with mixed results. Production values are high and most of the cast is game in creator Michael Hirst (of the excellent Showtime series THE TUDORS) and Chris Chibnall's rewrite which is decidedly more John Boorman than it is Lerner & Lowe. Joseph Fiennes gives an interesting portrayal of the magical sage Merlin but the central casting of Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur is perhaps the weakest screen portrayal of the famous king so far. However, the real fun is in watching Eva Green's delicious portrayal of Arthur's evil half sister Morgan le Fey. Whenever she is on the screen, she raises the proceedings up a couple of notches.

If this describes you, then I promise that if you buy Camelot, you will be sorely disappointed.  I wanted to love this series.  It is eye catching and, at first glance, isn't afraid to be gritty.  However, the dialogue is poorly written and the plot line is plodding and annoyingly predictable.  It is pretty to look at though.

However, after about five episodes I stopped watching it and would have rather watched the nature channel.  Pretty much everything is poorly done - the writing, the plot/direction of the show, and the acting which all come off as cheesy and sloppy.  In my opinion it was hard to make this show ""not"" work because who doesn't want to watch a show about Camelot, but somehow they managed to do that.

4403248,4,B004LROMSY,"The story of King Arthur has been told many times in many different ways. For some, it gets tiresome. For me, as long as the rendition is good, I'll keep watching. Camelot is the STARZ network's shot at this epic tale. Be warned, I am no historian and I watched this purely for entertainment, not to relate it to medieval history. If you are a history buff, there are a couple other reviews posted where you can get a better look.

Arthur and Morgan (Morgana) are brother and sister but Arthur isn't aware. He is kind of a player and lives quite care free. In the mean time, Morgan returns ""home"" to castle Pendragon after being sent away to live with the nuns. No surprise, Uther meets his end. Morgan is ready to be the top dog in the Pedragon clan until Merlin shows up with Arthur. Now the two become rivalries.

We see the characters that we've come to know from other tales, with some differences, almost like alternative universes. Arthur is really like a lost boy forced to come into his own. Morgan is just off her rocker. Merlin has an interesting history and the story of the Lady of the Lake is a bit of a twist. I'm not going to give away any more than that.

Being from the STARZ network, there are some scenes of graphic violence as well as graphic sex scenes (although not to the level of Spartacus). If you like other stories of Camelot and are in this for pure entertainment, give it a shot. If you're a historian, this will probably just annoy you.",1323388800,2,1467,4.366300366300366

This time its a miniseries from Starz and GK-TV that features a primarily younger cast, with some violence, some nudity and lots of drama.  All the main characters are back, from Merlin to Arthur to Guinevere.  The emphasis in this version of Arthur is the relationship between Arthur and his half-sister Morgan, and the political intrigue the latter pursues to defeat the former.  A major subplot is the formation of the Knights of the Round Table; here we see a lot of infighting as Arthur has to earn their respect under the tutelage of Merlin.  And Merlin here is more of a campaign manager and less magician, though he does resort to the latter only in times of need.

4403266,5,B004LROMSY,"Ya know what?  Every now and then I like a different twist on an age old story.  ""Let's try something different for a change"", say I.  Well, this series does not disappoint along this line of thinking for these very reasons:

King Arthur is NOT the manly Richard Burton we knew on the Broadway stage or the Richard Harris of the movie...he is an awkward teenager barely aware of his own existence on this earth who has to learn everything about being a king from the ground up as he goes along...he's a boy king who grows up to be a man and a leader of men.

Guenevere is NOT a virtuous Julie Andrews or Vanessa Redgrave...she's a young woman betrothed to another who has a failing for young lads like the teenaged king!

Sir Lancelot is NOT Robert Goulet or Franco Nero with a deep baritone voice...in fact, I don't think I've heard him sing even once in this series!

Merlin is NOT the spritely Roddy McDowell or clever Laurence Naismith...he is a believable ""magician"" of curious and questionable background who successfully uses his magic only to serve and protect the new king, yet he is shown to have vulnerabilities and human frailties at certain points in the story...he is NOT the omnipotent creature we have come to know in past versions.

Camelot is NOT the utopian ""Emerald City"" of modern Arthurian legend...it is an old, moss-covered, overgrown, rundown heap of stones that the new King Arthur and his knights decide to make their own because nobody else wants it!

And Morgan is just plain.......Morgan!

This version of the story is refreshingly different than the stories we've previously encountered.  My wife and I find ourselves sitting together on the couch, bowl of popcorn precariously balanced between us, saying, ""Oh, that was clever!"" and ""I didn't see THAT coming!""

4403268,3,B004LROMSY,"I confess that I am big fan of Spartacus (also from Starz), so I was eager to give this a try.  Spartacus itself was, well, an acquired taste--it has its own distinctive look and feel which took me a while to get used to...but once I did, I really enjoyed the show.  So, I tried very hard to extend the same patience to my viewing of Camelot.  In the end, it gets a pleasant but uninspired ""hmmm"" from me.  It wasn't a bad show, but it had a lot more promise than was actually realized on the screen.

It was nice visually, I'll give it that.  There were some lovely costumes and some of the scenery was simply breathtaking.  But it felt very ""updated"" for a film on this subject--hair was very modern or modern inspired, and everything was very very clean--something which was probably not the case in the court of King Arthur.  That is a small nitpick that I could easily look around, especially when the cast is as beautiful as these folks are.  They are definitely a treat for the eyes, and many of the actors did quite a good job given the lines they were fed.  Really, my beef is with the writers, for they failed me with their primary task--creating a fresh and well constructed story.

Everyone knows the classic tale of Arthur.  It has become quite the fashion to retell classic tales, putting a new spin on the narrative, and I'm fine with that.  The plot was close enough on some of the generalized stuff that it was still recognizable as the Arthurian legend--but the Arthur/Merlin relationship was just hard to take (someone else has already commented on his ""crucial"" rock-climbing tutorial), Morgan was laughably underdeveloped, and by the end of the season, it felt like the narrative threads were not being handled as smoothly as they should have been.

Insert a Small Guilty Swallow **here**.  I sheepishly report that I still finished the darn thing.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I couldn't stop watching...but I couldn't.  I can't justify it to myself.  I also can't believe it, but I actually want more.  But I can't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality retelling of Arthur's legend.  I guess it just filled a gap when I needed something moderately entertaining, and for that it fit the bill pretty well.

The sets are real great to watch and the wardrobe is awesome.  Jamie Campbell Bower would not be the actor that I would have chosen to play King Arthur, butI think they nailed the rest of the characters.  Eva Green certainly is evil and plays the part of Morgan very well.

Honestly, I loved the Tudors and I watched this series believing that it was suck me in like Tudors did, but it didn't, not even close.  I watched it, but I don't believe I would go out of my way to watch season two.  I think the modern updates turned me off...if only they could have stuck to the period like The Tudors.  The show had good bones, but poor execution.",1319241600,,796,4.26
4403271,3,B004LROMSY,"Well, it would seem that they have decided to re-make the Arthurian legend into a modern costume drama like Spartacus and some of the others currently in vogue.

It's passable. Though ""Arthur"" seems little more than a whiny peasant boy in the first season. I'm hoping that if they make more seasons he'll ""grow the heck up"" a bit. If not, this show may be doomed. Other than some gratuitous sex scenes (it was made by Starz, after all), it doesn't seem to have a whole lot going for it yet.

Others have noted that it's a bit revisionist and overly 'politically correct' with modern sensibilities rather than being completely authentic to the supposed time period. Though, given the Arthurian legend's general emphasis on 'justice/equality for all,' I suppose it's forgivable that modern notions of the same should creep in.

It does come with a few featurettes, if you're into that. I don't know if it's enough to 'save' the show.

If you liked the show, you'll probably like the DVDs as they're pretty competently transferred. There's the usual Play All feature, though it would be nice if the intros and credits could be optionally left out when playing all, to save on having to skip around or fast forward. As far as the discs themselves go, I didn't find much to complain about.

So, I guess it's just down to whether or not you like the show. Not my cup of tea, personally. Though, seeing Claire Forlani in a new role wasn't unwelcome, even if they did kill her off at the end of the show. Speaking of which, there were a lot of ""oh, come on!"" moments through out, not least of all being Igraine's (Forlani's) death scene. I could help myself when rather than naming her murderer to Merlin, she yammers on about pretty much everything else under the sun before finally dying. Seriously? It's nonsense like this that just makes me think the writing is a bit sub-par. And, I'm sorry, but gratuitous nudity can't make up for bad writing...",1319068800,,1943,4.636627906976744
4403272,4,B004LROMSY,"I'm not really into this genre, but I decided to give Starz original series a chance. It turned out to be far more entertaining than I expected. This is the King Arthur story that has been told before, but the level of 'adult' content has been increased since this is pay cable. The production values are very good, the acting ranges from acceptable to very good, and the writing keeps things moving throughout the ten episodes.

I actually really liked Joseph Fiennes as Merlin, Arthur's ally who sees a very dark ominous future for Camelot in the wake of King Uther's death. Jamie Campbell Bower is effective as young King Arthur. Eva Green makes a considerably hissable villian as Morgan, Arthur's half-sister and competitor for power over Camelot.  I must admit, I don't watch Game of Thrones or any other medieval-fantasy type of shows. So my point of reference is extremely limited. I enjoyed this as a time-passer, rather than a massively emotionally involving show.",1319068800,,973,4.890909090909091

4403274,5,B004LROMSY,"The tone and visual of this series lies somewhere between The Tudors and the first season of Spartacus: a fair heaping of graphic sex, lots of action and fighting and blood, plus sorcery and magic to boot. I thought they did a good job of making the show appeal to both women and men, which is not an easy task - could easily have too much historical emphasis and costuming & pomp, or too much blood and action.

We must keep in mind there was no real King Arthur but only many myths and theories. I have seen and read many retellings and think they've done some clever and creative things in this show. They strike a nice balance between the barbaric and the noble in the lifestyle of the time - no gleaming armor, but rough furs and leather armor instead, with rough thrones and much smaller castles and armies than usually pictured. In a way, it makes every struggle more urgent and visceral when there are only a handful of men against each other  in this way.

They have cast some quite good actors such as Joseph Fiennes, Eva Green and others. I like this trend of movie actors doing television and especially cable which can be more intense. I also recognized some other faces such as the lead from TV's short lived ""Crusoe"" (really, how long could a show based on that book go on?). I hope that fans of both fantasy and action check the show out. Starz is definitely doing some interesting things and I look forward to seeing thier other upcoming shows such as Torchwood (one of my favorite shows, which I was crushed when it was cancelled).",1318896000,,1549,4.447183098591549

4403276,5,B004LROMSY,"One of the best show in years it had all the elements action, romance, drama, Brilliant cinematography. The acting was superb the costumes were absolutely stunning! Jamie Campbell Bower is one to watch!",1318464000,,202,5.151515151515151
4403277,4,B004LROMSY,"Woven throughout this familiar tale of Camelot and King Arthur are new twists/variations that should appeal to most, even if you aren't familiar with the various versions of the story. Of course those who are familiar will recognize the central characters: Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), King Arthur (Jamie Bower), Lady Igraine (Claire Forlani), and Merlin (Joseph Fiennes). But there are some new characters: Arthur's brother Kay (Peter Mooney) and his betrayed champion, Leontes (Philip Winchester). There are the familiar themes of: sibling rivalry (one the illegitimate/reluctant ruler, and the other an ambitious vixen), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, sprinkled with tons of jealousy, betrayal and treachery; but there are new twists as well. Merlin isn't the stereotypical ""magic-using"" wizard, but instead comes across as a tortured/soul searching sorcerer but who is frightened of his own power , but who has grand ideas of rebuilding a nation, and creating a King. Merlin, driven to sometimes do the wrong thing for the right reasons, is perhaps the most endearing character in the entire series. Actor Joseph Fiennes brings a vulnerability to the role that I thought was unique. He could brood, pout, rant and rave, and yet you sympathize with him because he doesn't trust himself to use his power for fear that he will not be able to control himself. And while Bower doesn't exactly invoke the King Arthur image at first glance, he does bring a certain recklessness to the role that was refreshing. He's rash, impetuous, makes tons of mistakes, and does things without thinking of the consequences, but yet you still sympathize with his character because underneath it all you realize that he, although a King, is human too. He merely wants to belong and be loved, even if that means trusting unconditionally a half-sister who means him harm. Eva Green's portrayal of Morgan (Arthur's half sister) is chilling, and while she comes across as evil and dastardly, she does show us moments of vulnerability that evoke sympathy. You still dislike her, but you do understand her. And finally, one of the most subtle and endearing characters in the story (besides Merlin) is Leontes, whose faith (in God) and moral compass makes the viewer cheer for him with the hope that he will escape his fate (spoiler...which he doesn't). Leontes' betrayal shows you just how there can be tension between duty, honor and forgiveness.

Now a critique of the story, which has been done but I will put my spin on it. Young Arthur was raised by a family who did not tell him of his royal heritage, but yet he grows up spoiled and inconsiderate. He takes what he wants, when he wants.  Up until this point, Arthur has gone thru life recklessly, and yet with this new responsibility he appears to be maturing. His saving grace is his (adopted) brother who loves him unconditionally but also recognizes his weaknesses and forgives him. Anyway, when King Uther (who has battled his own demons...lust for a woman that wasn't his and loathing for a daughter who wants to be loved) dies , Merlin comes calling demanding that Arthur take his rightful place on the throne. The only problem is that Uther's exhiled daughter, Morgan Pendragon, feels hurt and betrayed and believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne, especially since she went thru all the trouble to use sorcery and magic to poison him. She has been making her own alliances, building her own army, all while assuming  that she will be Britian's new ruler. The question is what price will she pay for the magic she uses to manipulate and control those around her? She doesn't intend to let Merlin (a sorcerer who afraid to use his power) or her illegitimate half-brother Arthur to stand in her way. The viewer will enjoy the tension that exists between Merlin and his power. While initially he appears noble, at times he is misguided, and while his intentions are good, his actions don't always reflect that. He constantly struggles not to give into his urges and desires. Instead he wants to unite a kingdom, under one ruler and return Camelot to its original glory. There are some other interesting plots in the series, but you will have to watch it for yourself.

What I enjoyed most about this story was the underlying theme (while not new) that everything is not as it seems). People can be fooled (literally and figuratively) into making poor decisions, especially if it is something that they want or desire (Morgan as Lady Ingraine....Morgan as a girl...Morgan as Guinevere). I also enjoyed the explanation of how certain myths and tales were embellished to foster hope and kinship. The storyteller also took several creative liberties and changed reintroduced the various myths that we thought we knew (the lady in the lake and the sword in the stone). The only thing that I wished to see was a change in the role of Guinevere. While Egerton is incredibly beautiful, I thought that they could have done so much more with her character. She was the typical Guinevere, beguiling and yet we knew she would yield to temptation. While on the surface she appears/pretends to be noble and strong, she also comes across as fickle and confused about what she really wants. After all, she is attracted to Arthur, and yet feels an obligation to marry Leontes (who she has dated since childhood), only to later betray him.

Although there was nothing too-too original about this adaptation of the traditional story of King Arthur, there were a few new nuances that enhance the story, not to mention some  decent actors, who work well with the material they were given. There are a few slow parts, but overall there are enough fight and love scenes that kept the story moving. The DVD also offered some extras that included bloopers and interviews with the actors. At the end of the day, I don't regret those hours that I spent watching the show and the good parts (scenery, acting, etc) definitely outweighed the bad/slow parts. This version of Camelot definitely is worth watching as a marathon on a Sunday.",1318377600,,6073,4.8912621359223305

4403280,3,B004LROMSY,"I received this DVD set as part of the Vine program and had not heard about it prior to my selecting it. On broad terms, I would rate this series as average when compared to the entire population of shows on television.  The average television show is mediocre, but it is something that provides entertainment if you just want to come home from work and zone out on a mindless distraction to pass the time.

I found the characters to be rather stock (although Arthur seems to be miscast; he does not seem to be a kingly type). Aside from Arthur, everyone else fits a stereotypical mold and there's alot of overly dramatic acting. Others have commented about it being a low-budget production and that is how it seems to me - they have to keep the cameras in close to make it seem like there are a lot of people, but there really aren't that many people in the kingdom.

Overall, it's a forgettable series but it works as a diversion for an hour of entertainment in an evening.",1318118400,,975,4.405555555555556
4403281,3,B004LROMSY,"CAMELOT is produced by the Starz network, and the fact that they don't have deep pockets is evident in nearly every frame of this series.  It's a very ambitious project, but unfortunately, it pales somewhat in comparison to similar ""medieval"" themed series such as GAME OF THRONES.  It just feels a bit rushed.  To be honest, the production values are roughly on par with shows like XENA and HERCULES...but in those shows, the cheesiness was part of the fun.  Here, it is a distraction.

CAMELOT tells the familiar tale of young King Arthur.  In fact, in many ways, it tells the story in much the way that the great John Boorman film EXCALIBUR did.  It tries for a gritty, slightly graphic (both in terms of violence and sex) approach...and I appreciate that.  Arthur is not just some shiny ""good guy"" but is full of foibles and faults, particularly in the early going when he feels so very uncertain about his task and his own abilities.

There are some familiar faces.  I had initially been very optimistic about Joseph Fiennes playing Merlin...but his performance is over-the-top and really shows no effort on his part to build a credible character. Eva Green LOOKS great as Merlin's foil Morgana...but she's never been much of an actress and doesn't bring much heft or real menace to the role.

The show has lovely locations and pretty terrific costumes, I must say.  It is just very pleasant to look at.  In the end, I think shoddy writing and low-budget effects make this only passably watchable.  I'm not a huge Arthurian Legend buff, just a casual fan.  This show might generate more enjoyement from hard core appreciators of those stories.  I'll stick with EXCALIBUR and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL!",1317945600,,1712,4.772108843537415
4403282,4,B004LROMSY,"I'm not a big fan of the Camelot legend, and that fact might well be important since I see quite a few reviews from people who are thoroughly dissatisfied with the series. I found the series generally fun and enjoyable. Though the ostensible focus of the series is on the young King Arthur, who ascends to the throne after his father, Uther, is assassinated by Arthur's half-sister, Morgan, the star of this show is Joseph Fiennes, who steals the show with a compelling portrayal of Merlin, the reluctant sorcerer. The basic premise of the first season is Arthur's attempt to establish his reign, primarily by doing good for the people who would be his subjects. In this effort, he exhibits quite a bit of twenty-first-century sensibility, something I can see bothering people.

The central tension throughout the season is provided captivatingly by Eva Green in the role of Morgan, Uther's daughter and Arthur's half-sister. She believes the throne is rightfully hers and plots frequently to claim her right. Arthur, for the most part, naively hopes that he can embrace his sister and the two can be united in their aim to help the people. Jamie Campbell Bower, as Arthur, seemed to me initially miscast, but I must say he grew on me and ultimately seemed effective. Tamsin Egerton, however, as Guinevere, seemed ineffective, not because of anything she does wrong per se but because of the way her character has been re-envisioned with feminist sensibilities that seem greatly misplaced for the period in which this show is set. Then again, I felt the same thing about Rose in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B000VS6R26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>, and that film seemed to do OK financially.

The look of the show is generally excellent, from Camelot to Castle Pendragon to the countryside settings. It should be noted, though, that this retelling of the legend is hardly a family-friendly affair. The language is coarse at times, the nudity is abundant, and the simulated sexual scenes arise frequently.",1317772800,,2071,5.291793313069909
4403283,3,B004LROMSY,"Maybe it's me. But I was hoping that this series would be a great take on the legend of King Arthur. However, I found myself bored to death most of the time, mostly due to an inexperienced cast that would be better off in ads for Abercrombie and Fitch. There's not enough respect for the source material--which does NOT need revising at all. The production values are just fine, but between the script and the terrible acting, you end up wishing Merlin would just blow everyone to bits. The series lasted one season; I know why!",1317600000,,528,4.510416666666667
4403284,5,B004LROMSY,"I just finished watching season one of ""Camelot"". I really enjoyed it especially Joseph Fiennes performance as Merlin.

4403285,2,B004LROMSY,"It's hard to figure out for whom this cheesy new series has been conceived.  Viewers who don't know the King Arthur legend won't appreciate the re-imagining done by its creators, and stalwart Arthurians will just be pissed off by it.  Which begs the question, ""Why fiddle around with an audience's expectations if you're not going to make the story better?""

The Sword in the...Waterfall?  Really?  Because a plain old stone isn't good enough?  I don't know, it worked just fine for Alfred, Lord Tennyson and E.B. White.  But silly me, this is television, where pandering to the lowest common denominator is something of a requirement.  Thus the simulated, soft core porn, public urination and Philip Manchester's hilariously awful, anachronistic Justin Bieber haircut.  Manchester's character, BTW, is Leontes, fiance of Guinevere, who in this version is a Malibu type babe who seems to have hung out a little too much at Ye Olde Fighte Club.  Leontes?  What happened to Lancelot?  Oh, yes, I forgot, this is a bold, new, rethinking.  Perhaps he'll come snowboarding in sometime during Season Two.  Or not.

On the plus side, the production values are solid, as, for the most part, are the performances (Clare Forlani's wooden Igraine the bland, yet painful, exception).

Enter this ""Camelot,"" if you must, but be aware that's it's the kind of Classic Comics cheese that will stink up the place long before you've reached episode 12.",1317513600,3,1434,5.038297872340426
4403286,4,B004LROMSY,"I'm not as well-versed in Arthurian Legend as many of the other viewers are, but why would that matter? I think that's the point of retelling the Arthurian Legends - to introduce it to more people.

I enjoyed ""Camelot"" overall. This series takes the myths and legends about King Arthur, Merlin, and Camelot and tells a portion of the tale. The series begins when King Uther is killed and Arthur is told he is to become king.

Some complain that ""Camelot"" does not remain true to the legends. First, what's wrong with reinvention in a story that has been told and re-told for over 1500 years? Second, am I the only one confused by people's reluctance to allow for leeway in the telling of a story that is mostly myth and legend to begin with?

Some parts were a little slow, but in a 10-hour series, you're most likely going to have that. Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur was rather annoying for a while, but he came into his own in the last couple episodes and if the series had gone on, he would have continued his development of the annoying boy king into the Arthur we all know (or a fictionalized version of the fictionalized version we all know). Yes, sadly, it seems that ""Camelot"" will not continue as a series, which is too bad, especially since the setup for the second season looked very promising.

The casting was quite good overall. Eva Green as Morgan was really the standout in the series. Joseph Fiennes as Merlin was good but restrained - it's safe to say we would have learned much more about Merlin in seasons to come. I've never said, ""You know, Claire Forlani was really memorable in this,"" but her portrayal of Arthur's mother was very surprising to me. The eighth episode featured her in almost every scene and her performances were heartbreaking and excellent.

I loved the spin they put on the Lady of the Lake myth - it was creative and visually beautiful.

If you have a glimmer of interest in watching this, I recommend you give ""Camelot"" a chance knowing that the Complete First Season is actually the Complete Series.

4403290,4,B004LROMSY,"This DVD series is based on the legends with which many are familiar.  It has the usual people and usual incidents that one would expect of the King Arthur tales, but don't expect them to follow the plots of the story you know and love.  However, the stories they did tell are an interesting twist on the old legends.

This is not the best fantasy staging I have ever seen; there is a lack of realism.  Camelot must be small because it takes very little time to travel between farms and castles.  When the men are out hunting deer they are talking and stumbling all over the forest.  There are very few characters in any setting, castle, village, and soldiers.  Most disturbing in my opinion is the choice of actors for King Arthur, Jamie Campbell Bower.  There is some nudity and violence but it doesn't distract from the story.

That said, I liked and would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys fantasy, King Arthur, or the Middle Ages.  It has some interesting story twists regarding the Lady in the Lake and Excalibur.  As some others, I loved Eva Green as Morgan.  I would like to see how the story continues if STARZ decides to continue the series.",1317168000,,1159,4.519230769230769
4403291,3,B004LROMSY,"When I first heard of this my initial thought was that it was from Starz, the same network doing the Spartacus series, so I had very high hopes.  See, for the past three years I've been watching the BBC show, ""Merlin"", which is a fine little show about the Arthurian legend (although they've totally buggered the original story into something very different than any telling of it I've ever heard).  But that show is obviously FOR KIDS.  And ""Merlin"" is a nice show, FOR KIDS.  I had hoped the one on Starz would be a more realistic, true to the time version.  Sure, there are things I like better about Camelot.  ""Merlin"" completely left out Sir Kay, Arthur's brother.  Camelot doesn't make that mistake - and that character is one of the ones you really end up liking.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews here that the show simply didn't go to where it could have.  It doesn't have the gritty realism I was hoping for.  It does, however, have some interesting characters - Merlin, Morgan, Kay, Gawaine and others.  Unfortunately, Arthur is not one of them.  I think the guy they cast for that part was chosen for something he had to do with ""Twilight""????  Sorry, but I never watched any of the Twilight movies, so I'm not sure what he did in them.  Anyway, a show like this really has a problem when it mis-casts its leading man - and they did that.  It's too bad they can't go back a re-do that casting decision before season two starts.  However, because of the good characters they do have, the show still has potential to be something better in the next season.  I hope they get their act together and achieve the potential that's there.  I gave the first season three stars because the first season of a lot of shows is kind of rocky.  Look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Who would have known how great that would become just after watching the first season?  I hope Camelot can similarly grow into its own skin.",1317168000,,1931,4.444444444444445
4403302,5,B004LROMSY,"This series based on the legend of Camelot is very well-done: beautiful production, authentic costumes, great acting and interesting plot. All the men playing the knights are excellent in their roles, all testesterone and manly in their portrayals. Philip Winchester particularly stands out as Leonites with high morals and a true faith and sense of honor. Clive Standon Gawain is all macho knighthood and Peter Mooney as King Arthur's brother gives the show a sense of family. Joseph Fiennes is brilliant as Merlin and gives his character a sense of magic and mystery. The women of Camelot are all beautiful and perfectly cast in their respective roles. Some reviews on here critisized Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur, but I think he was right for the role. He is supposed to be a boy-man plucked from obscurity and placed on the throne. He should look a little out of sorts and uncomfortable at first and should appear too young for the part, but as time goes on he rises to the occasion and finds his position with more confidence. I think if the show was allowed to continue, we would have seen him grow more ""kingly"" as he grew into more of a mature man. It's a real shame that the show was cancelled and we will not be able to see how the story continues - Is Morgan pregnant by King Arthur? How will Gwen and Arthur's relationship develop? When and how will Lancelot enter the story? Where did Merlin go and why did he leave?

4403304,4,B004LROMSY,"Reviewing TV shows is kind of pointless - if you're looking for it, you're almost certainly a fan already, but in case you jumped here via a link from a similar show, here are thoughts from a new viewer:

I was asked to review this program having no prior experience with it at all. Granted, I did not expect much. Yea, another cheesy period piece with Hollywood pretty boys pretending to be tough and dramatic. HOWEVER - after the first 4 episodes, I find myself eagerly awaiting the rest!

They twist the popular telling of King Arthur in new and interesting ways. The production values are very high, the sets are lush, the lighting well done, and the matte painting special effects and cinematography are far above average. The location shooting in Ireland and Canada is a treat. The writing and acting are certainly decent, and the cast, while mostly filled with Hollywood pretty boys/girls is well cast and does a good job.

I love the understated way Merlin is portrayed by Joseph Fiennes - until the fourth episode you still can't decide whether he has any wizardry powers at all. The Arthur character is and noble at heart, but impetuous and young. He is well played, but somehow remains the least interesting of the main characters for me. His nemesis, half-sister Morgan (Eve Green), practices witchcraft and borders on over-the-top dramatics in her attempt to capture the throne, but she reigns it in just enough to make her character fascinating and very hard to take your eyes off. (There may be some actual wizardry here - you may remember Eva as the Bond girl in Casino Royale - yet here, she looks younger and sexier than she did several years ago in that film.)

For an ""action themed"" story, it runs at a slower pace than some of its rivals, but I feel this works well for them. While there is some nudity and profanity, it is mild compared to the graphic violence-porn of things like Spartacus. Camelot, so far, would be a PG-13 to Spartacus's strong-R or NC-17 - allowing Camelot to pay more attention to characters and story. It is clearly trying to appeal to the male and female demographic. Except for the occasional nude scene (not graphic, but not mild either) it could be shared with the teens as well, but they might be a bit uncomfortable if the parents are around!

I'm a little concerned as to how this story will keep its momentum. About half of the classic Arthurian legend is covered in the first 4 episodes, so they're going to have to be creative to keep up the quality exhibited so far, but I'm hoping that they succeed, as I would strongly recommend Camelot based on the first 4 episodes.",1316995200,,2626,4.614561027837259
4403305,3,B004LROMSY,"In short, Camelot feels like someone saw how popular HBO series like True Blood are and thought, ""Hey!  Let's do that to the King Arthur legend!""  Camelot is a sexed up, melodramatic retelling of the Arthurian legends, and while it isn't particularly bad, it's not exactly great either.

The good stuff:
The casting is very good, and the actors all do a really nice job with the material they're working with.  Jamie Campbell Bower is pretty good as Arthur-as-a-young-man, playing the character as both intelligent and naive.  He wants to do the right thing for his kingdom, but he's still just a kid trying to figure out what on earth just happened to him.  Eva Green starts off as a wonderful Morgan, a woman who is vengeful and power-hungry (a stereotype that I'm admittedly pretty tired of), though the character takes a turn for the cartoonish toward the end of the series.  Joseph Fiennes is great as Merlin, playing the character much more morally ambiguously than many Merlins before him, and I'm actually sad that we didn't have more Merlin in this series.  Fiennes was one of the strongest actors involved.  The other supporting characters are also well-played, from Arthur's knights to Sinead Cusack as a Machiavellian nun.

The costuming and set design are both lovely if occasionally anachronistic.  I really loved the costumes, and they do look appropriately medieval as long as you don't try to figure out exactly when the series is set.  The cinematography is also very nice, although the CGI leaves something to be desired.

The not-so-good stuff:
No matter how good the actors are, they just couldn't save the show for me.  The writing isn't great and the pacing is atrocious.  I spent half of the series bored to death, even though I'm sure I was supposed to be riveted based on all of the lying and obfuscation and magic going on.  The entire season's plot felt like it should have been the story for four episodes at most, and if they had condensed some of the more painful elements (the betrayal/romance storyline between Arthur and Guinevere, for example), the show would have been much more enjoyable.

The writers did try to turn some of the most familiar elements of Arthurian legend on their heads, but it just wasn't enough.  The big surprises in the plot are laughably predictable, and in the season finale, I spent half of my time saying ""I told you that would happen"" to my fiance as we watched.

On top of the pacing issues, I felt like the sex and nudity was just thrown in for titillation.  Nothing wrong with a little tittilation, I think, but after about the fifth time we had lingering shots of the women's breasts (and very little in the way of male nudity; come on now, Starz), I was over it.

I like Arthurian legend and I like seeing what new adaptations people come up with.  Even though Camelot treaded a lot of new ground, it just didn't tread it gracefully enough for me to really like it.  It's an okay series, but just that: okay.  And since the series hasn't been picked up for a second season, you won't get much closure at all in season one.  Unless you're a big fan of the actors involved, I can't really recommend this show.",1316908800,,3176,4.648745519713262
4403306,2,B004LROMSY,"What is it that draws studios to keep remaking and reinventing the Arthurian saga? Over and over, productions big and small keep getting made. I can only imagine that it's because it has instant recognition and they don't have to pay a license fee to anyone.

I've probably seen most of them and read a great many written tellings and re-tellings of the story. We've now come to the age where these stories are attempted to be told as semi-historical rather than fantasy. I suppose they feel that makes them more grown-up. Why they simply don't make Bernard Cornwell's trilogy to achieve that is beyond me but this review is about this cancelled Starz series.

This show had potential but got lost. If not for the single episode where Excalibur is acquired I would have given this an even lower rating. Had the entire series been like that I would have given it 5 stars.

Without spoilers I will explain the problem.  The problem is that the story and characters bear no resemblance to anything Arthurian other than a few names. The entire story centers not around Arthur but his half-sister Morgan. It centers around her undermining Arthur's attempt to be the heir to the throne. We get characters we've never heard of and don't care for or about introduced and have episode after episode dwelling on and on about them and their insignificant side-plots to the story.  I'd balk less if they were entertaining but they aren't.

The stories give you no satisfaction to watch. I understand series with a big story arc but the good ones have episodes that stand on their own. I was so fed up with the story I fast forwarded much of the last two episodes just to finish.

Have you ever seen a movie where the entire story falls apart if two characters ever talked to each other as you would expect them to in real life?  Relationships would get saved, the victim wouldn't go into the garden where the monster is still waiting. Someone doesn't do the simplest check if they are being lied to, etc. There is a lot of that.

And Arthur and Guinevere? You won't buy it for a second that it's in this Arthur's nature to give up his womanizing for nothing more than a pretty face.  And as far as Merlin's character, it's clear they were undecided which way they wanted to portray him.",1316822400,6,2274,4.565110565110565

It's a very different telling of the King Arthur & Merlin Tale and I quite enjoyed it.

I knew that Joseph Fiennes and Eva Green were both in it, so I figured it had a shot to be good and I was not disappointed.

The anamorphic widescreen picture is in 1.78 :1 and looks great,the  Dolby sound is very good quality too.

The soundtrack is in English and Spanish along with both in subtitles.

It comes with several short subjects about the show,along with a blooper reel.

This is meant for adults,there is nudity and the occasional obscenity thrown in

There is tons of teen angst with this King Arthur,they show a much younger man in the role & it's kind of fun.

Tamsin Egerton who plays Guinevere is stunning.

4403308,2,B004LROMSY,"I will make this short if not sweet:

Like another reviewer before me, I cut my literary teeth on the Arthur legend.  I got my first Arthur book, ""The Once and Future King"", when I was barely able to read.  I LOVE the story, and have read every book and seen every film I could find although again like a previous reviewer I haven't found that many that I felt were worthy of the story.  I like the original legend which probably makes me a traditionalist.  This take on the story didn't even seem like the Arthur legend to me.  I felt they could have renamed the characters, put them in a another environment and it would have been an entirely different tale.  I'm not as down on the actor playing Arthur as alot of people seem to be, but I'm not wowed by his portrayal either.  I'm a strong Joseph Fiennes fan and find his interpretation of Merlin to be the only one I really appreciated and enjoyed.  I am invested with these characters and I would prefer that their story remain as originally conceived.  The only exception to this would be the Merlin character.  I liked the younger, edgier Merlin.  I found the scenery, the lighting, the photography, the costuming (good to see for a change that it was more suited to the 5th-6th centuries than to medieval times) to be excellent and feel that had the story/script matched the film quality it would have been a winner.

If Starz had decided to do a second season of this show, I would probably not be watching.  I think by cancelling it, they made the right choice.",1316649600,,1521,4.424460431654676
4403309,3,B004LROMSY,Enough said.  Three stars for costume.  The chap who plays Merlin gets 4 stars.  He knows how to act.

4403310,3,B004LROMSY,"King Arthur seems to be rather a difficult subject to adapt. For me, not one of them has really done it well, but a few come close. Excalibur is a stand out, Mist of Avalon isn't too bad, and even Sam Neill's Merlin tries hard. The recent King Arthur starring Clive Owen was fun, but really a retread of The Seven Samurai.

One of the major problems, is what do you put in and what do you leave out? Do you set it in a medieval fantasy world or in the grim Roman-Britain dark ages? How much magic do you put in? Is it real or pagan religion?

This adaptation is rather poorly thought out. The stand out problem for me right off the bat are the costumes. The ladies do all right in nebulous renaissance fair outfits, but the men fare poorly. There is hardly any armour and virtually no helmets. This makes the whole thing look cheap and rather silly. Even dark ages Britain went in for armour, if not as much as the later ages. The story of King Arthur, for me, is about KNIGHTS IN ARMOUR, and that's what I expect. Instead you have rather floppy hairstyled young men running around in baggy shirts claiming to be the champions of the king. I don't believe them, they look rather wet. There is no sense that this is King Arthur, these are his KNIGHTS and he is a military force to be reckoned with in the land.

The magic aspect is poor. Morgan can do an impressive spell and make herself look like some one else. Impressive. Merlin can burn people and turn lakes to ice in minutes. Very impressive. So magic, powerful magic, exists in this world. So why go for nonmagical explanations about the Sword in the Stone or Excalibur? The treatment of the Sword in the Stone would work in an adaptation with no 'real' magic, but not here. The Excalibur adaptation is worse. Merlin gets the sword for Arthur in a very mundane way (from a weaponsmith), kills the smith, chases the smith's daughter (named Excalibur?!) to her death out on the lake and prises the sword from her dead hand as she sinks beneath the ice that Merlin magically turned the lake into. How bloody complicated! How dumb! The story's already there, why not just do that instead?

The cast are OK and there are a quite a few shots of attractive naked ladies on view for those of us who like that sort of thing. Joseph Fiennes and Claire Forlani seem to be trying to act being each other in their scenes together. Fortunately Forlani has long hair, so you can tell them apart. Actually, that's kind of mean for me to say that, but their scenes are rather tedious. The whole Arthur, Guinevere, Guinevere's so-what husband character plot line is lame too. It just wastes storytelling time.

The best thing in this is Eva Green. She does a great job. Pity the show around her is lame.

So, all in all, a wasted opportunity. So much gold in Malory, so much drek here. I did watch this right after watching Game of Thrones, but even without that excellent series fresh in my mind, this is LAME.",1316131200,3,2950,4.393772893772894

Up to then it had potential especially when it seemed to get the costumes for the period correct but then it became a bit too campy and the usual Arthurian archetypes were a bit peculiar (i.e. Guinevere pulling a knife out on Arthur and pinning him to the ground when she had no combat ability, Arthur looking like a bleached blonde surfer who seems more of a dork than a military hero, etc). There's some saucy, sensual scenes in here as well as your usual run of violence and the settings are well done but I need to look at more than sunsets and this series just doesn't have it. That said, if you haven't studied a lot of the other Arthurian spins or just want to see some swords and sorcery this is an average presentation.

But as each episode progressed, it became sillier and sillier, mired in it's inability to extract an Arthur that compels our attention or a cohesive story line.  Much as been said of Eva Green's performance, but it is so over the top it renders her role as Morgan almost laughable. She and Joseph Fiennes are wasted in this production, and it is not their fault: they were forced to speak what the writers put in their mouths.

All in all, this is a series to be avoided at all costs.  To spend a dime on a DVD that presents such drivel, is money ill-spent.  It ranks right down there with ""First Knight"".  Try Boorman's ""Excalibur"" (ASIN: B000Q66JXA) instead.

I wrote a paper some years back on the Arthurian Legend... So when I heard about this series I was excited and immediately began watching. While I think much of the plot developed differently than that in the translations of the original stories I read, I was not disappointed in that aspect of the show. The parts of Merlin, and Morgan le Fay were executed with perfection. I actually saw Merlin as the dominant character over what is supposed to be Arthur. C'mon... The first person I think of when I hear the word chivalry is King Arthur. Instead, I get an overly whiny punk lusting after the wife of the man that saved his life?!?! Really?!? ""whaaa... Im the king.. whaaaa.. why don't they do what I say?"" I wish Sean Connery would show up and mushroom stamp that clown! I think the producers tried to put a ""Smallville"" twist on the Arthurian Legend with a little T&A on the side... Only problem is: they forgot the superman character! It kind of reminds me of when George Lucus casted Hayden Christianson as Anakin Skywalker, just too EMO!! KING ARTHUR WAS LEGENDARY FOR BEING HONORABLE! So far the best scene I can note of this Arthur is when Queen Igraine slaps the taste out of his mouth in episode 4.

There is still time for Stars to salvage this operation. First and foremost, Arthur.. call up Sean Connery,Clive Owen, or maybe even tried reading, and get the part right. Guenevere, stop being so loose, and put some clothes on!! Sir Hector, and King Lot: come back to life.. you died way too soon. Sir Kay, Morgan and Merlin: Dont change a thing! Gawain: Your character kinda contradicts it's self but it's okay! And what's with the Nun that is on the side of the villainous Morgan? Has Starz gone so PC and Liberal that they are forgetting that Arthur was one of the First British kings to be known for his Pious virtue? Why are they casting Christianity as evil, and this lust driven punk as the good guy?

Glaring, brooding, and basically giving each other the evil eye throughout the episodes, doesn't translate to good acting either. Enough already! The producers should have waited a year and gotten a sneak peek of Game of Thrones and used that as a guideline for making a epic show, where both women and men can be strong and sensitive and not necessarily having to resort to weeping for cheap drama. If anyone else is going to do a show of over dramatic seriousness of this magnitude, they should consider throwing in some humor here and there to insure that the viewers don't completely fall into a mental depression after each episode.

I was waiting for Merlin to spit chewy tobacco throughout, but he never did. I think I did see him spit though.

I could tell the evilness of Morgan, just based on the amount of eyeliner that was applied and the strength of her glare. I figured the less glaring she did in a scene, the less evil she was for that moment.

I went into the season open minded, meaning that I was ready for another version of the king Arthur legend since I liked Excalibur and several other versions; however, please note that even I couldn't ever like First Knight.  I don't want to give away too many details if you want to watch the series, but be forewarned it sucks due to miscast, poor script,small budget (needed more extras as warrior knights and common folk) and political correctness (modern feminism, multi-cultural/post-racial, etc.).  It also smacks of hollywood trying to ride the ambiguity fence...that the characters are neither good nor evil, lies somewhere near the gray area of fallibility etc soap opera.  Where are the knights trained in combat arms of the day (heavy cavalry)?  They must have spent the whole budget on a few talent and camelot castle CGI because Camelot lacked in depth in many ways.

The opening scene of young Arthur caught after sleeping with his brother's girlfriend...was just wrong.  I don't believe that would have occurred back then, but note that it was more revealing of Arthur's character later in the series.  Merlin (Joseph Fiennes) was absolutely believable and Fiennes gave an amazing portrayal of a cunning yet ""might-be-mad"" sorcerer.  King Uther's sorceress daughter Morgan (Eva Green) was brilliantly played and deserves recognition.  Arthur's knights seemed like real men yet too ""clean"" and not like the battle-tested rustic knights like Templar Knight James Purfoy from the movie ""Ironclad"".  (and a black-african knight? in England?  New one for me.)  With Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur???  One of the biggest miscasts ever.  Between his bad acting and his wimpy looks (trained to carry a sword? morelike a bow perhaps), he does not fit the king arther role.  So, he's a ladies man, I get it...better role as a bard than a man fit to rule England.

I liked the creativeness of how the sword in the stone and lady of the lake became legend, but anything recognizeable stops there (the potential arthur/morgana season finale hookup that produced an offspring that never occurred).  Camelot quickly turned into a soap opera with the bitter evil nun advisor, mixed asian/black-african maid (they never developed her charater), and Egraine plot that just turned south.  Poor character development of Arthur's knights and other characters.

I will admit that the season finale was not thought out. The journey was quite entertaining.,1310256000,3,402,4.757142857142857
4403355,2,B004LROMSY,"CAMELOT isn't perhaps as bad as some of the reviews on here would paint it.  It is however awfully mediocre at best.  And I don't think that the acting is bad so much as the main roles being completely miscast... I stayed with it for about five episodes in the hope it would get better, but it never did...",1309996800,3,306,4.169491525423729
4403356,4,B004LROMSY,"I happened to like the show.  I agree that some characters are played out better than others, but I am hoping that the weaker characters are still in the ""developing"" process.  =)  I watched the entire season and can't wait for the next one.",1309737600,5,241,4.431818181818182
4403357,5,B004LROMSY,"Some negative reviews here but perhaps you are comparing (too much) Camelot to
HBOs 'Thrones' which yes better acting & writing but I found Camelot to be great fun- I agree
With some that Arthur was a casting mistake- he is a good young  actor but just doesn't 'fit' what
We think Arthur should be like- a bit more like THOR's Chris H- if you're going the blonde route
Would have been a better choice-Joe Fiennes talents were poorly misused - he is a superb actor and
Should have had more meat in his roll- yes weak writing to blame in all counts but I wasn't comparing it to
Game-which is superior in a lot of areas-- I was just enjoying the show and having fun watching as not
Many chances( for those of us who enjoy King Arthur period shows ) to have a series to indulge in.

Have to say- the opening sequence-credits is one of THE most BEAUTIFUL show openings I've seen
In ages and the MUSIC is breathtakingly gorgeous - treat yourself to the iTunes score/soundtrack!!

I look forward to next season....warts and all :) Perhaps STARZ will indulge in some new writers
For the sophomore season - give the actors a better chance to shine! Its a good show, don't toss in the towel yet!!",1309737600,4,1186,4.381818181818182
4403358,2,B004LROMSY,"I love King Arthur and his legendary knights, whether it's gritty ""historical"" stories or a pile of medieval anachronisms a la Malory.

But the once and future king has really gotten more than his fair share of rotten movies and TV, and the latest disaster is ""Camelot."" No, not the Broadway musical or the movie adaptation -- this is Starz's attempt at updating the timeless Arthurian legends (which don't NEED updating), which just turns into a silly, sloppy and overly PC mess.

The evil princess Morgan (Eva Green) murders her father Uther, exiles her stepmother, and allies herself with her dad's enemy King Lot. But Merlin (Joseph Fiennes) is having none of this, and hunts down Uther's secret illegitimate son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), who has been raised by an adoptive family in the country. With Merlin's guidance and training (in rock-climbing), Arthur claims the throne --and gains Morgan's wrath.

He also falls in love with Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), the beautiful young wife of a loyal knight, and is deftly manipulated by Merlin in decidedly unmagical ways, sometimes with bloody outcomes. As young Arthur struggles to unite Britain under him, he must deal with Morgan constantly trying to undermine his rule and his power -- but with little idea of just how far she will go.

The idea behind ""Camelot"" is not a bad one, and even the rewriting of Arthurian lore (the origins of Excalibur) aren't that bad. The problem is in the execution. This series wants to be a plot-heavy, gritty, authentic ""Game of Thrones""-esque story, but it's actually more of a silly, anachronistic BCC ""Robin Hood"" (complete with multiculturalism and modern feminism, which makes it doubly ridiculous).

Yeah, this is one of those series where the costumes, sets, perfectly-coiffed hair and even some of the beautiful scenery all feel like they were lifted from a Renaissance Faire. There's no feeling of timeless grandeur, epicness or awe -- instead, it sometimes feels like ""King Arthur: The Legendary Journeys."" Additionally, the main storyline is.... rather weak, especially since the straightforward Morgan's plans for overthrowing Arthur get downright silly.

As for the acting, it's a mixed bag. Fiennes is wonderfully conniving and Machievellian as Merlin, almost to the point of being villainous, Peter Mooney is dynamic as Kay, and Green is brilliantly wrenching as a destructive yet wronged young woman.

However, Bower's Arthur is a massive twerp, with zero presence or charisma. He's a skinny surfer-dudeish kid whose appeal is honestly a total mystery. I mean, his Arthur only decides to become king because HE CAN SCORE WITH GIRLS. Who can take that seriously? As for Egerton, she's painfully awkward and rather flat, and her character is Mary-Sueish to the extreme.

""Camelot"" is a painful experience -- not just because it's a lackluster, weakly-plotted series, but because it could have easily been so much more. Give it a pass.",1309219200,72,2945,5.133611691022964
4403359,1,B004LROMSY,This is one of the worst excuses for a show I have ever wasted time watching.  Compare it to Game of Thrones for instance and that show has depth and great characters. Camelot has the most fem vision oF Arthur I have seen and poorly acted as well.  Eva Green as Morgan is the only redeeming thing in the show and sadly even that is not saying much.  Do not waste money on this one.,1309219200,16,381,4.053333333333334

That's the reason I cannot give this more stars, because even though I enjoy the episodes on this disc,  the disappointment of being cut off lingers.

That's my take on this, otherwise I really enjoy the way the story develops, despite one of the wimpier young Arthurs I have yet to see!",1526515200,,492,4.568181818181818

8434660,3,B004LROMSY,"The discs come in a plastic and cardboard folding contraption. The discs play fine.

Great female actors in this series but the main protagonist, Arthur,  is a bit of a dweeb, a wimp with pencil thick arms and big ears. There isn't a lot of common sense in this series. It's all about parties, dancing and weddings, meanwhile the land is not united and is embroiled in chaos. Bandits take over Guinevere's house but Arthur and his crowd just let them have it. This series makes World Without End, which is a so-so miniseries, look good. The Pillars of the Earth is much better and so are Reign and The Tudors. Two current series that are also better are The Vikings and The Last Kingdom. Camelot is at the bottom of the heap.

If the above don't sound interesting you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2407,5.065656565656566
