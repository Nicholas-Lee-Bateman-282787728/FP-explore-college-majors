1030625,5,630545941X,"This is one of the best concert videos I have ever seen. The concert footage is fantastic and it also contains stories about the band and their travels. The guys from Matchbox 20 tell the stories themselves and they are a very humorous bunch of guys. It brought back memories of the concert I went to, including the feelings of excitment and exhiliration that I felt on the night. It truly made me feel like I was back there again. An un-forgetable experience. I have this video in my collection and I suggest you should have it in yours.",988502400,,538,4.444444444444445
1030626,5,630545941X,"Im from the UK and when I bought this video, I didn't realise it would turn up in american format. Luckly my boyfriend had a VCR that plays VHS.
We watched the video (as he is also a fan) and it was absolutely fantastic! I absolutely love MB20's albums and really wanted to hear them live. I was definately not dissappointed. What a superb video, they have such a sound. I really enjoyed the music videos at the end. Living in the UK, you don't see many MB20 Music videos over here. So it was a treat! Buy the video, excellant value for money.",988329600,,543,4.230769230769231
1030627,5,630545941X,"This is a great video.  Not only do you get to see the band perform, but you get to see them interracting with each other.  The music videos at the end is a nice touch, as well.  Very much worth the money you'll spend on it.",973296000,,224,3.8260869565217392

7889451,5,630545941X,It's Matchbox Twenty - Live from Australia.  Hello?  MB20 - Live - Rob Thomas.  Does anything more need to be said?,1418860800,,115,4.380952380952381
7889452,4,630545941X,"This is a concert video from Sydney, Australia when the band had only released their amazing first album. The music is fantastic, Rob Thomas has a great voice, the musicians are great and they are all really into it. If you're a fan of the first albumn then you'll live this.

Just a little pet peeve of mine (actually on most concert videos) is too many crowd shots, and there are alot of shots of people being pulled out of the mosh pit.

But overall, it was great.",1323561600,,467,4.295454545454546
7889453,5,630545941X,"I received this as a Christmas gift in 1999 and I loved it. I was so happy to finally have a video I could watch whenever I wanted. I loved their version of ""Time After Time."" It was the best remake I have ever heard. I really loved the videos at the end, which I play over and over!! The funniest part to me was when Rob talked about his dirty mouth and how he curses alot. That was funny. The music was great and so were the behind the scene extras. I also loved the end when the credits were rolling and they start talking about opening for the Rolling Stones. Rob's accent is hilarious. If you love MB20 you should have this video.",1084320000,2,635,4.088
7889454,5,630545941X,"Not only one of the best videos but one of the best concerts I have ever seen, this video shows the guys at there best with this classic collection of Matchbox 20 hits... the only beef I have is, whens the dvd version of this video going to be released?
But all is good, this video brings back so many memories from when the guys toured here (Australia) for the first time and since then I have been back to see them for there ""mad season"" and most recently there ""more thean you think you are"" tours... thanks again guys!",1076371200,2,522,4.23
7889455,5,630545941X,"This is a must have for anyone who caught the Matchbox Twenty disease.  Everyone's heard their music at some point and said ""ya that's how I'm feeling"".  Well here's a video of the guys who knew you so well.  Live in Australia give you a glimpse of the personalities of Matchbox Twenty with backstage clips and on the road snapshots.  Their live performance bleeds through you when you hear all your favorite songs from Yourself or Someone Like You with added lyric by Rob's anguished soul.  You also get to hear great covers of Cyndi Lauper (Time After Time) and The Beatles (Don't Let Me Down).  Matchbox also performs their pleading You and I and I.  And when you thought it was over, their classic videos, you can't ever catch on MTV, are on there, including the hard to view Rob in a tie, Long Day video.  So if you're a generation Matchbox Twentyer, ""Keep your distance from me, don't pay no attention to me"" and buy this video.",1074384000,12,934,4.485207100591716
