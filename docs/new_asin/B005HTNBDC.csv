8473625,5,B005HTNBDC,"I found both Jin 1 and Jin 2 very entertaining. Not only is there drama but also a lot of medical/scientific history in the story. I thought Haruka Ayase should have had a bigger part in the drama but that is my opinion. Other than that, I thought the drama was pretty well written and Haruka Ayase really helped the main character, Jin, in getting the drama to the level of a real drama.",1350345600,,388,4.256756756756757
