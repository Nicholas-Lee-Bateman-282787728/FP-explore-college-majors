Thanks for making these available.",1178409600,2,107,4.944444444444445
2714344,1,B000LV6W0A,"I'm dissapointed, once again, with the package release of this series. I bought Seasons 1 and 2 when they both came out, but was reluctant to buy season 3 due to it's 2-volume packaging. However, Season 3 is no different in addition to a complete different casing as well. Instead of the traditional digi-pak packaging like most television series' come in (including the first four released packages of Touch By An Angel), this release is in a hard plastic casing that does not uniformly match the rest of the Series' release. This just does not look as well on a DVD shelf as it should.

I'm not suprised this studio decided to change thier casing as well. By now, I've learned that they frequently dissapoint consumers with their inconsistant releases. The show is great entertainment and very encouraging. However, with the poor releases of the shows, I don't see them worth my money. I suggest watching the re-runs on cable and tv instead. I'm gonna wait until the studio releases something better...even if it's years. I'm patient.",1175731200,3,1036,4.853107344632768
2714345,5,B000LV6W0A,"I am so glad volume four is out. I have the previous three and I loved the entire series when it was aired on CBS. Touched By An Angel is one of the most wonderful feel-good programs ever aired on television. I can't wait for volume 2!!  For those of you who may have missed seeing it on television, you don't know what you're missing. Do see it on DVD. You won't be sorry!!",1174780800,2,374,4.054054054054054
2714346,5,B000LV6W0A,"The best show to ever grace television screens hits us again with the fourth season!  I'm happy they are speeding up the releases now but wish they would stop trying to milk the public of money by splitting up the sets!!  I give the series five stars and the fourth season kept building on the tried and true formula of its success!!  Great episodes with favorites being ""Jones vs- God"", ""The Pact"", and ""Children of the Night""!! Enjoy and keep speeding up the releases!!",1174780800,2,471,4.583333333333333
2714347,5,B000LV6W0A,Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! I encourage everyone to get this collection and all others from the Touched By An Angel series.,1171670400,3,128,5.45
2714348,1,B000LV6W0A,"I love the series. It's very uplifting. But the only one I know of that can't release an entire season at once :(

Never thought an angel would be passing the collection plate more than once during a service. I did pay for both volumes of the third season. Which was basically twice as much as it would cost me for an entire season of any other series.

Sorry Monica, I'll wait 'til they get bundled up from now on.",1169683200,20,415,4.175
2714349,4,B000LV6W0A,"Though I love the series, I wish they would have released the full fourth season at the same time with Volume 1.

My niece, Ashley Thompson, was in the episode ""Perfect Little Angel"" playing Ashley Fitgerald a contestant in the Miss Colorado Pageant.  This episode is aurguably the best episode of that season.  Ashley got to sing ""Unchained Melody"" during the pageant sequence and though most of it was cut out when CBS aired it in 1998 , I was hoping they would lengthen the performance for DVD release.  Excited for the release sometime later this year.",1168992000,3,556,4.701030927835052
2714350,5,B000LV6W0A,"i love this series and am so glad that it is finally on DVD!  to tell the truth, i wish that CBS would have kept touched by an angel going, even after 10 years-than we would have monica as the supervisior training angels!  i have almost every tape and book to go with this series and now have all but the 1st vol. of season 3; and of course this volume.  this is one great family show!!",1168560000,4,386,3.987012987012987
2714351,5,B000LV6W0A,"I thought I would update this review. Many people are complaining about the Seasons being split up and the cheaper packaging. Home Improvement has started down this path as well (with cheap packaging) because previous seasons have not been selling well. I can only guess the same is happening with Touched By An Angel. I don't think any of us want to see TBAA dissapear off the radar. We really need to support this show and make sure they release future seasons.

Here is the list of episodes in this set:

Joe's Return-
Nathaniel's father suddenly returns and wants to be a part of Nathaniel's life again. His past is uncovered and why he has been on the run is revealed. (2 hour episode)

Great Expectations -
The angel Taylor (Chris Burke) is back with Monica, Andrew, & Tess to help minister to a couple who finds out their unborn baby will be born mentally retarded.

Nothing But Net-
Rafael (Alexis Cruz) and the angel trio help a rude and cocky All-Star basketball player who is hiding his weaknesses from the world and is a bad influence to a special young fan.

Children Of The Night-
The Angels guide a group of teenagers who live on the street and are on the run in fear of being returned to their families.

Jones vs. God-
After a long drought and poor crops a man decides to sue God in a professional court hearing. A ridiculous premous but a touching ending as always.

The Pact-
The angels minister to a camp of girls designed specifically for young girls with HIV and AIDS.

My Dinner With Andrew-
Andrew is auctioned off as an eligible bachelor and the woman who wins the bid turn out to be the angels assignment.

Charades-
The angels arrive to help Libby Glaser, a powerful Hollywood agent, learn the truth about her Blacklisted father's last days.

The Comeback-
The Angels minister to Lillian (Carol Burnett) and give her self confidence after having a discouraging past in theater.

Sandcastles-
The angels search for a man named Benjamin (William Devane) and learn the truth of his past.

Venice-
Tess and Monica arrive in Montana to help the elderly Annie Doyle (Piper Laurie) reconcile her life before she loses her failing eyesight.

It Came Upon A Midnight Clear-
The angels return to Wayne and Joey and Monica tells Joey an assignment she had with Mark Twain.",1167091200,41,2288,4.633663366336633

2714386,5,B000LV6W0A,"Touched by and Angel is one of those series that no matter how you feel at the moment it will lighten up your mood. It is a soul-cleansing show that gives you hope and makes you see the brighter side of things.

As usual, I bought this for my mom, who is a huge fan of the show. I had to buy the separate volumes because the entire season did not have an audio track in Spanish. We are very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone who already likes the show or someone who just wants to watch a heartwarming and interesting series.

However, if you don't need the Spanish audio track, I'd recommend you get the entire season and not the volumes.

Sadly, as of this date, there are no more season available on DVD. Let's just hope that they DO release the rest!",1261008000,,775,4.222972972972973
2714387,5,B000LV6W0A,"love this TV series because it provides great inspiration, i.e. it makes you feel that you have a goal, a ""mission"" in life, that you don't happen to be here on Earth ""by chance"". It also gives that kind of hope that encourages you to go ahead in spite of life's challenges and setbacks. Whatching these stories you believe that YOU have meaning, that you matter, that you can do good to others, and that you are not alone in your journey.",1241481600,,439,4.365853658536586
2714388,5,B000LV6W0A,this prodect is a blessing and because Amazon.com gave to me at a bargen price I almost have the whole set.

2714389,4,B000LV6W0A,"I really loved this show when it was on TV. They cheered me up during hard times (adolescence is always hard it seems without adding anything else) and the stories are very soap opera like. The messages are good, the episodes are well-written. The guest actors are not always the best but for the most part they find good people. Great for if you need cheering up, fun even if you don't. I wish they would put the whole season in one box and throw in some special features. Quite a number of explosions and fire for a show about angels.",1212278400,,536,4.316831683168317
2714390,5,B000LV6W0A,"For those inclined to invest entertainment time with something uplifting and productive, the Fourth Season will not dissapoint.  While the general aspect of the storylines are unchanged from the series origin, the acting and character development keeps getting better.  There is real chemistry developing in the fourth season and the writers are making good use of the dynamics.  The series continues to address the issues of life faced in common by mankind and present a picture of God's grace and mercy that will likely get a thumbs up in Heaven.  Too bad the series was discontinued.  The question remains, what needs to happen to get the rest of the series on DVD?",1212192000,,668,4.928571428571429

2714392,5,B000LV6W0A,This was an excellent show and it is a real blessing to have the first 4 seasons on DVD.  I just keep hoping and praying the other 3 seasons will be released as well.,1186531200,,166,3.8823529411764706

2714394,5,B000LV6W0A,"I highly recommend ""Touched by An Angel.""  The show deals with real life situations and shows us how God expects us to handle them.  There is a God who loves everybody and is willing to forgive our sins and accept us into His family.  This message needs to spread across this country and the world.",1186185600,,298,4.381818181818182
2714395,5,B000LV6W0A,"This is my favorite TV show. It warms hearts, lifts thoughts and moods, unite families to watch and teaches a lot. This show offers a chance to rethink ones life. It doesn't matter what your religion is, because this show is not about religion. It is about spirituality, love and compassion. It is about finding what is truth in ones life. The angels are here because they love human beings and I love these angels.",1183507200,,415,4.546666666666667
2714396,5,B000LV6W0A,"I can't believe true TBAA fans are refusing to buy these DVDs because of their packaging?? True, the packaging has gotten cheaper and while I wish they would release each season in its entirety, it's only because I want to be able to watch all 9 seasons on DVD before I die!

I'm sure these DVDs don't sell millions of copies like Sex & the City and Desperate Housewives (not enough sex or violence), but I'll take TBAA any way I can get it, even if they package it in a plain manila envelope!

They don't make television series like this anymore which is one reason I watch very little TV. I just hope they continue to release the remaining seasons in as timely a fashion as possible. This is one TV series that's all about the message each episode delivers, not the package it arrives in!",1181174400,5,790,4.36734693877551
2714397,5,B000LV6W0A,"I just cannot wait until the fourth season volume 2 comes out, this show is what I use to go to sleep by every night, it is my night cap. I love shows that are wholesome and Godly to watch, I hope they will produce more of these kind of movies.",1180310400,3,244,3.803921568627451
2714398,5,B000LV6W0A,"While I am disappointed that once again this season is split up into two volumes just like season three, I am just glad that they are continuing to make the show available on DVD.

In my opinion, it's not the number of episodes that are in the set that counts; it's the episodes themselves and the messages that they deliver.  I purchased this because this show was my favorite when it was on.  I made sure to tape it if I was going to be away when a new episode aired.  I even watched reruns of it on PAX for a while.

So even though yes, it is split up, it is still here to purchase and when volume two of this season comes out, you can bet that I'll be buying that as well.

I highly recommend this to any fan of TBAA.  It's half the season, but the wonderful messages are still there.",1179964800,10,788,4.04516129032258
2714399,4,B000LV6W0A,Continuing saga of Touched By An Angel starting off with a double episode featuring the recurring Green Family. Well up to usual standard and not running out of ideas. A delight for fans but a little disconcerting for new viewers who lack some of the background for the first story. Worth persevering though or start with another disc.,1178928000,3,335,4.793103448275862
2714400,5,B000LV6W0A,"I am a #1 fan of ""Touched By An Angel"" and this 4th season DVD is just wonderful.  I'm just sorry that they went and divided it into two volumns like they did with Season 3 ... it makes it more expensive and makes us wait longer for the rest of it.  But I love the show ... it's inspiring and beautiful, with a beautiful, talented cast with Della Reese, Romy Downy and John Dye. I look forward to having all the seasons as they come out on DVD.",1178928000,2,444,3.9775280898876404
