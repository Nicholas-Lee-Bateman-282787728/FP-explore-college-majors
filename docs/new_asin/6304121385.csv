7861954,3,6304121385,"This release is no longer the most complete available version of ""The Battle Of The Century""... or it soon won't be.

As reported by Slate today, a collector named Jon Mirsalis has found the complete second reel of this classic! He has handed it over to film restorer Serge Bromberg at Lobster Films to clean it up in preparation for a new theatrical and home release of the entire film. Be on the lookout!",1434499200,,406,4.486486486486487

7861956,4,6304121385,"Despite the partially lost second reel, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's ""The Battle of the Century"" (1927) remains a classic for its spectacular pie fight. Thanks to the efforts of silent-film preservationist Robert Youngson, this legendary sequence has survived the ravages of decomposition. A must-see for anyone who appreciates movie comedy.",1415491200,,343,5.745098039215686
7861957,5,6304121385,"The Battle of the century begins with Stan in a boxing match and ends with an epic pie fight with a whole truck load of pies for
ammo. Each pie has a comic message all it`s own. The very last word on the pie in the face gag.
The problem is that not all of the film survived the heavy hand of time. A section of the mid part of the film has been lost forever.
Even so, the parts that were salvaged will have you howling with laughter.",1263081600,,433,3.8764044943820224
7861958,4,6304121385,"It's unfortunate that the entirety of this film does not survive, since it seems like it could have had a lot more substance and a better-developed plot if the missing sections were intact.  Here we see the first reel, featherweight boxer Stan up against a big burly opponent (the great character actor Noah Young).  Stan knocks him cold in the first round, but things don't go so nicely in the following round.  Ollie, his manager, knows that something has to be done to bring in the money and to make sure that Stan gets out of the ring before he has another chance to be slaughtered.  And this is the section that is lost.  What we don't see is Ollie taking out an insurance policy on Stan so that they'll stand to collect a lot of money if he gets injured.  Ollie also arranges for Stan to conveniently get injured, by slipping on a banana peel.  However, as we find out in the surviving half of the second reel, a pie delivery man (the always wonderful Charley Hall) slips on it instead, and as fans know, this little guy had a big temper.  Before long pies are flying in all directions, with everyone in town, seemingly, getting in on the act.  Of course, this was also the biggest pie-fight in movie history.  And the ending shot alone is priceless, gorgeous Anita Garvin falling right on top of a pie and clearly having pie filling lodged in a very uncomfortable and inconvenient area.  She walks off with the picture as she walks away, discreetly trying to shake the pie filling off.  That kind of thing would probably have never been allowed after the Hays Code came into being.

This film was on the brink of decomposition when it was rescued and restored, even in this abridged surviving format.  Some people might like the other version which includes the script and stills, but that's not really as entertaining as watching the surviving format.  That kind of thing is good to watch once for curiosity, but I don't think most people would prefer to watch a film constantly being interrupted by pages of scripts.  And as for people dense enough to claim that the reason this film doesn't survive in full is because it wasn't important and hasn't stood the test of time are seriously misinformed about the real reasons behind the poor survival rates of silent films.  We're lucky all of L&H's silents have survived apart from 'Hats Off' and the missing sections of this film; many other big stars were not as lucky.  It had nothing to do with how good or bad these films were or how important they were to a person's career; it had everything to do with people not caring about an artform that was deemed a dinosaur overnight, and not even caring about preserving a large portion of film history till for many films it was too late.",1138060800,3,2744,4.5426829268292686
7861959,4,6304121385,"Comedians from Jackie Gleason to Jerry Seinfeld have talked about the influence of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. These two folks were just FUNNY and influenced generations of comedians due to their timing, material (even in their worst of later films they were a class act), innovations (much of what they did was copied by others later) and most of all their on-and-off screen chemistry (Jackie Gleason and Art Carney effectively caught this feeling). This early silent video will show you some examples. This is a video you MUST have and own. Why? Several reasons: 1)It has one of the greatest pie fights EVER filmed. Don't try this at home! 2)It has a zippy music soundtrack, assembled from old sound disks, itself worth the price of this video. It is priceless: music perfectly selected right out of the ""Roaring Twenties,"" bounc ymusic from the old Vitaphone recordings (early sound on disk -- I defy anyone to get ""Ain't She Sweet"" out of their heads as the final credits close!). This music was not, however, actually used when showing this short (but you'd never know it since the selections is done so well). 3)The swift-paced direction of Clyde Bruckman. 4)The famous shot at the end where the beautiful Anita Garvin slips on a smashed pie and tries to get up and walk away with dignity. Realize that this short was considered LOST for many years. Some parts are missing. So they run this short on this video twice, once with photos, pages from a script, etc. I seldom watch the second version. I watch the first, with the missing parts and no script. If you are expecting a LONG Laurel & Hardy short, you won't like it. If you're going to be annoyed that part of the short is missing and they re-run it, showing pages of script (to show fans who wonder what the original looked like), you might not like it. But I can tell you THIS: I showed this recently to a 5 year old and a 9 year old -- and they wanted to see it again and again. They especially laughed at the shot where a big mouthed guy sitting in a dentist chair gets a pie in his mouth -- and by the absolute chaos as the pie fight goes out of control. I also GREATLY disagree with those who say that the team isn't polished. They had a different ""flow"" in silent films and this will be a revelation to those who love ""the boys"" or younger folks who are discovering them for the first time. The pie fight is worth the tape. The sassy score is worth the tape. And poor Anita walking away at the end is DEFINITLY worth the tape. It's a short short -- but one you'll view again and again...and one you'll have others (including kids) watch.",998697600,7,2608,4.458158995815899
7861960,4,6304121385,"In ""The Battle of the Century,"" the 1927 two-reeler directed by Clyde Bruckman, Laurel is a prize fighter being managed by Hardy.  Obviously, Stan will not be making a lot of money at this occupation, so Ollie takes out an insurance policy on his fighter, figuing to make some money that way. Of course, while accidents happen to Laurel all the time, Hardy becomes the victim of every deliberate attempt to hurt his friend so he can collect on the policy.  However, the reason for watching this comedy is that it ends with one of the truly epic pie-fights in movie history, precipitated by a banana peel on the ground that claims the wrong victim.  ""The Battle of the Century"" was ""supervised"" by Leo McCarey and based on a story by Hal Roach.  When this comedy short came out it was seen in both silent and sound versions.",990748800,,823,4.54054054054054
7861961,5,6304121385,"I am amazed at some of the other ""critics"" who cast aspersions on this film. They do not know that a) this was a ""lost"" silent film or that b) it has been rescued from oblivion and major sections are  missing. The slipcover on the tape explains this.  The film contains two  wonderful shots. The first is the ""epic"" wide shot of the pie  fight dominating the city streets (literally thousands of pies were used).  The other favorite shot (Stan Laurel's also) is where actress Anita Garvin,  unaware of the pie fight, slips and sits in a pie (which she thinks is  something else). According to Garvin, she did this for free on her lunch  hour as a favor to Stan Laurel.",961891200,6,668,4.418032786885246
7861962,1,6304121385,"Do not buy this video unless you enjoy straining your eyes trying to read pages of typed script.  Great sections of the film are missing and in their place are shots of blury script pages.  Then they go to a tiny film segment  and back to the script.  More than unenjoyable, it's down right enoying!",950832000,3,299,4.381818181818182
