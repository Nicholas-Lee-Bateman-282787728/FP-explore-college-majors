8173216,5,6303410839,"Clint Eastwood is wonderful in this light hearted and yet at the same time heart moving Road Movie/Romance. The country music score provides  a great source of atmospheric pleasure, and the back up characters are colorful and well acted.  A must for all Clint Eastwood fans.
ps.  Don't be mislead by the 'Double Pack' title, as 'Every Which Way But Loose' precedes 'Any Which Way You Can'.",971049600,,389,4.776119402985074
