Not only do we get to see Portugues lyrics but also English AND Spanish subtitles to every single song Yay! There's a Selena song ""Dreaming of You"" in Portuguese version same with ""Mientes"" from a Mexican band called Camila again in Portuguese. PLEASE! Get this DVD you will love it!! (Plus, we get to see Paula Fernandes perform with Tania)",1472515200,,508,4.593406593406593
