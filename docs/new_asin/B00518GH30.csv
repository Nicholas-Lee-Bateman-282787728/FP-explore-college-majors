4519594,4,B00518GH30,"Missing the socially awkward, but magnanimous, Nathan from the show, but I think they got the groove back and the storyline is moving along.",1358899200,,140,4.875
4519595,2,B00518GH30,"I watched seasons 1 and 2 and really liked the show. I found out that season 3 doesn't have Robert, but decided to give it a try. I just watched episode 1 and could not get myself to go beyond. There is a new character instead of Robert, he is like Robert but not as funny, and seems out of place with trying to be Robert and yet not succeeding much. I found his soliloquy very boring. In addition, there is lack of continuity from season 2.

SPOILER ALERT *** Season 2 ended with them thinking of getting new powers, episode 1 of season 3 doesn't do a good job of continuing with that and making it clear exactly what the new powers were ***SPOILER COMPLETE.

So overall I was disappointed and could not get myself to continue beyond this episode because I really liked Robert in the previous 2 seasons.",1356307200,2,804,4.317880794701987
4519596,5,B00518GH30,I love this series. Can't wait for season 4. Too bad my faves aren't coming back but I'll cross my fingers...sorry for the spoiler if you haven't seen all 3 seasons yet.,1348790400,,169,4.3125
4519597,5,B00518GH30,"I own seasons 1 and 2, every episode is amazing. Season 3 came out, didn't have one of the main characters, the season is still great but not as great as the first 2 seasons. However!!! still watch it because it's entertaining!",1347408000,,227,4.428571428571429
4519598,5,B00518GH30,"This series is ridiculously surprising, shocking, hilarious, and entertaining.  They pack more wallop into one episode than you'll get in ten movies at the cinema.  Can't believe I'm the first to write a review here.  An honor.  Bravo Howard Overman you are a genius.",1329609600,2,267,5.0

4519601,5,B00518GH30,The last great season!  I LOVED seasons 1-3.  Seasons 4 & 5 characters are mostly different and tone has changed.  I would still suggest watching them but season 3 was awesome,1470787200,,175,4.580645161290323

4519605,1,B00518GH30,"Terrible. I thought the British knew better than to do this sort of thing. Everything is bad, no special effects at all, and I simply lost interest after the first episode.",1436486400,,172,4.580645161290323
4519606,2,B00518GH30,"To be honest, I did not get through the whole season. So it is a bit unfair to give it 2 stars. Perhaps I will go back and give it another shot in the future, but as of now, can't get past the loss of Nathan. Watch the first 2 seasons and then check out BBCs Uncle.",1426291200,,265,3.6666666666666665
4519607,5,B00518GH30,one of my all-time favorite shows!! and a pretty good price,1423526400,,59,4.454545454545454
4519608,4,B00518GH30,"I loved Seasons 1 and 2, and darn near quit watching after Nathan left at the end of Season 2.  Nathan was my favorite!  I only stuck around for season 3 because of Simon and Alisha. Simon was my second favorite character, and I loved his romance with Alisha.  Unfortunately, I did not see as much of them as I would have liked.  And I'm sure that Iwan Rheon (the actor playing Simon) would agree with me.  I read somewhere that he left Misfits because he was unhappy with what they did with the character in Season 3.

The first episode of Season 3 is lame, and we see far too much of Rudy in in it.  But stick around, the season gets better.  I feel that Kelly ""stepped up to the plate"" this season and was far more interesting than she had been previously.  Lauren Socha deserved the BAFTA she won for this!  And this season did have some great episodes - like episode 2, with Curtis' gender confusion and my favorite - episode 4,  with the Nazis.  I'm sad about losing Simon and Alisha.  Which is why I have no desire to see Seasons 4 or 5.",1423267200,,1044,4.185929648241206
4519609,5,B00518GH30,One of the best shows I have ever seen!,1419897600,,39,3.4444444444444446
4519610,4,B00518GH30,"I didn't mind the addition of new characters, however I felt like they were expies of some of the exiting characters. I don't mind characters that have similar attributes as old character, that's fine. My problem was that some of new cast that were introduced in this season seemed like one of the characters that just left: Name and powers are the only difference.

I did like how they closed the time-loop, even though I could think of several ways they might have avoided that ending. I was a little disappointed by how they ended Curtis and Kelly's run, but it was a decent segue into series four. It also freed the actors to do other projects.",1418947200,,648,4.538461538461538

4519614,3,B00518GH30,Going into this season was disappointed that the funny lad was replaced with another one. The first one definitely a better funny lad. Gave this 3 stars since the rest of the cast was still there even though the story lines were weak at times. First two season stories were definitely better though.,1408406400,,299,4.660377358490566

4519619,5,B00518GH30,I like this series - it's rough and tumble and irreverent and the accent is almost impossible.  What can I say?,1392163200,,111,4.285714285714286

4519622,5,B00518GH30,"OMG, this show is amazing!  I've just finished the 3rd season and it's still going great.  It's sad that the actor who played Nathan quit the show, as he was my favorite character even though he was the worst kind of person to be around.  This digital version is missing the episode that explains his absence called ""Vegas, Baby!""  You can find it online, though.  Others have done better justice in explaining how good this is, so I just came to tell you about the missing episode.

Don't watch the series online, just buy it and support creativity.  It's well worth it.",1389571200,,571,4.53921568627451
4519623,5,B00518GH30,"Having seen all 3 seasons, I will say that Season 3 is probably my least favorite.  I say that for 2 reasons.  Firstly, because the character Nathan is gone entirely and without any reason as to why.  All you know is that Kelly says he went somewhere to make money.  Period.  He's just gone.  The new character that replaces him is alright, but you still miss Nathan's snarky remarks throughout the entire series.  Secondly, the ending to this season is fantastic, and as much as I love this show, I feel that they really closed it off for making a 4th season in terms of plot.  If they left it at 3 seasons, it would be a beautiful ending.
As a Misfits fan, I will still encourage other fans to purchase the 3rd season regardless of the 2 downers.  The show remains highly addictive with unthinkable plot twists that you will never see coming.  Of course this season, everyone has completely different powers--and those powers seem to keep changing throughout the show.  Still a great buy.",1379462400,,990,4.568181818181818
4519624,5,B00518GH30,"The Misfits season Three returns with everyone favorite Misfits minus one.  Nathan has made his way with Marni and the baby Nathan Jr. to faboulus Las Vegas and use his powers to make himself and his new family rich.  Meanwhile the others Curtis, Kelly, Simon, Lisa are getting used to thier new powers and life outside of community service.  And so far they all seem to be bored with what life has to offer.  Kelly is a rocket sicentist and no one is taking her seriously.  Curtiscan change into a woman since the power broker didn't have any other powers on hand. Lisa can see through the eyes of others and Simon seems to be able to look into the near future and adjust so that things go his way.  Simon is also training himself to become 'Super Hoodie"" since he thinks this is what he will become.
  Of course we are intorduced to the newest Misfit Rudy who seems to be able to split himself into two versions of himself one good one bad.  As he begins his community service with two other girls he begins to wonder if he will ever get out of having to do any real work.  As his bad side gets closer to one of the women, his good side chats up the other and she begins to think he likes her.  Of course we all know that's not what happens with the Misfits.  The girl that good Rudy talks to has a power of her own and she stops time trying to hurt Rudy and after an unsucessful attempt thanks to the others decides to kill them all.
  Of course this doesn't stop the Misfits as they once again find themselves in community service and have to deal with things that come along the way wearing the orange jumpsuits.  They take on zombie cheerleaders, the undead, body swaping villans, Nazis even! All this plus echos from thier own past that will change the very future of the Misfits forever.  So check out Misfits Series Three today and see what you have been missing.",1376352000,,1872,4.305714285714286

4519626,5,B00518GH30,"I absolutely loved season three, even without the pleasurable company of Nathan. It definitely gave the writers and cast a chance to experiment and shine.",1363305600,2,154,5.2
4519627,5,B00518GH30,I love misfits just started the series not that long ago and by far one of my favorite tv shows. Dry crude humor is right up my alley.

8452401,2,B00518GH30,"Clearly a professionally produced television show featuring actual trained actors.  I like the earlier seasons, but this show had clearly run out of steam by this point.  Nathan, despite being unlikable, was gone, and for me that's the last straw.  I couldn't watch this, it's a different show with nothing to keep me there.  Everything worthwhile has been done with the premise.  I won't one star it because it's clearly a real show, and perhaps I would watch it if I had to, but there are other uses for my time.",1491436800,,514,4.604395604395604
8452402,5,B00518GH30,"I don't miss Nathan at all; the new character, Rudy, is funnier and less of a jerk. There are more novelty episodes here (Nazis!) that are really entertaining but a little out of place. They've really upped the tragedy level in this season, too, so there's a good mix of plot lines. The season finale wraps up a lot of story lines very well, and could have served as a series finale.",1486944000,,383,4.333333333333333
