Use the tape if it is good condition.",1413763200,,166,4.21875
8670827,5,B00M974A9Y,Fantastic documentary.  Clear and mind boggling footage from the early twentieth century following the guideline of Barbara Tuchman's excellent book.  I guess the BBC took great care in preserving the footage from that era.  It is stunning.,1411516800,,240,5.4324324324324325
