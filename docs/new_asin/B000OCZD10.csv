8286310,5,B000OCZD10,"This movie is from the Akihabara trilogy of films,  and if you know Akihabara that should be enough of a description in itself.  For those of you who don't, its a sort of geek mecca in Tokyo where anime, manga, and video game fans flock to get all kinds of mechandise.  It is also full of 'Maid cafes', where pretty girls dress as cute maids in overly stylized outfits.
I'm all about this kind of stuff, so I really liked the movie, my only gripe is that it is way to short, only about an hour!!
The main characters best friend is an over the top Otaku who is just hilarious!  Any other Otaku will definetly be able to connect with him.
The movie is short, the production value is low, and if you are not an Otaku or Akihabara denizen, this film is probably not for you.  On the other hand, if you are, then this film is definetly for you!  I loved it and its a must for serious fans of this sort.",1335225600,2,897,4.097142857142857
