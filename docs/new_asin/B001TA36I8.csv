8340851,5,B001TA36I8,this was gvs 1st video and it brings back a lot of memories for me and if you remember songs like just like heaven new wine and he is mine it will bring back memories for you too. if you remember the days of Mark Trammell & and Gerald Wolfe with The Cathedral Quartet you will take a step back in time and hear some Cathedral classcs as well. this is a must have for GV AND CATHEDRAL FANS ALIKE,1445558400,,394,3.9375
