8408880,5,B003Y7F1I2,"We love Annie Oakley and have bought all of the Dvds now available.  This is one show where good is good and bad is bad and the opportunity for a change of thought and behavior is offered in every show.

Lofty is the Deputy Sheriff, Annie is the niece of the Sheriff, and Tag is Annie's little brother. The Sheriff is not in the stories much, so the concentration of the episodes is on Lofty, Annie, and Tag holding the fort while the Sheriff is away. The stories always involve goodness overcoming evil and there are lessons each episode for all.

All three of the main characters are a joy to watch when they exercise their horsemanship!!!  They alight upon their saddles as if they floated on air, even Tag!! Their horses are wonders at galloping.  Love watching them!!!!!!!!

The love and affection shown between Annie and Tag, and the wonderful friendship between Lofty and Annie, and Tag, is very fine indeed. They come across as real people who have chosen to live the higher way of life, to do good to all.  Kindness and compassion rule the day.  But they have their foibles, too, as we all do.

The use of guns is in every show, but all means are taken to shoot the guns out of the hands of the bad 'uns, rather than to shoot the person.  Because of the continuous showing of the difference between good and bad, the use of guns in that time and place is well done.  I highly recommend this show for all ages.",1382054400,,1418,4.374045801526718

8408882,5,B003Y7F1I2,"This show is a relatively simple one as far as the plots of it are concerned.  The staple fare consists of a chase, a shoot out, a fistfight, and someone getting bonked on the head.  But the fact that Annie Oakley is so clever with her gun shooting and the general goodness of the lead characters shines through make this show a quality series.  Some of the episodes in this box set appear to be a little out of order.  As Tagg grows up in some of the episodes but then there will be an early one stuck in there and he is quite little again.  The sound quality could be improved upon.  But hey, we can't have it all.  And this is pretty close to it all when it comes to a tv series.  There is a lot of horseback riding and tracking down of bad guys, who almost all look alike.  But the overall emphasis on doing the right thing in the show comes through and I find myself looking forward to evening when my Mother and I sit down to watch an episode.  Alas!  What is my only complaint?  I want more!!!  I just have the very last episodes to watch and I'm dreading life without my evening dose of wholesome entertainment.  Needless to say, I rate this a five out of five.",1360195200,,1169,4.115044247787611
