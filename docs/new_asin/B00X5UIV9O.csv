7158868,4,B00X5UIV9O,"Hate to tell everyone this, but I found this movie at my Wal-Mart today, July 11th (even though the website and Wikipedia are saying August 4th as the release date). I bought the movie and watched it. It features the voices and personalities of the Looney Tunes from the TV series. It follows the story of Lola, a perfume enthusiast who wants to make her own fragrance, and Bugs, a cab driver, who are on a crazy, fun filled trip from New York to reach Paris while the likes of Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam and other problematic people try to steal Lola's created perfume, which can turn anyone it sprays invisible. The reason for this is because of a rare flower, a flower used in her perfume, that only sprouts once every 200 years and was sought after by the military before it made its way to Lola.

Basically, all the characters have their same personality and voices from the Cartoon Network series ""The Looney Tunes Show"" and you'll see the likes of Bugs, Lola, Daffy, Cecil Turtle and more Looney Tunes (except for Taz, Sylvester and Tweety). Otherwise, the movie is pretty funny and is a real charmer if you're a Looney Tunes fan. Personally, I enjoyed the Cartoon Network series and was happy to see their voices transferred to the movie. It also comes with 3 Road Runner shorts, a Sylvester and Tweety short and the pilot episode of said ""Looney Tunes Show"".",1436572800,9,1365,4.571428571428571

7158877,4,B00X5UIV9O,"Think of this as a romantic comedy with Lola Bunny sharing top billing with Bugs, and you won't be disappointed. Rachel (""Mike Tyson Mysteries"") Ramras, the third actor to provide Lola's voice, plays her as a spazzy-cute obsessive who shakes up everyone and everything around her, including the unflappable Bugs. Ramras, who co-wrote the screenplay and co-directed the voice cast, turns Lola into a screwball but stunning leading lady, in contrast to Kristen Wiig's scary-crazy Lola in THE LOONEY TUNES SHOW. I enjoy both approaches to the character, but Ramras's Lola is definitely the more marketable version.

If anything, RABBITS RUN is the first big step in promoting Lola from the supporting cast to the first female character in the front lines of the Looney Tunes boys' club (unless you count the gender-ambiguous Tweety). As a trickster figure who can hold her own with Bugs Bunny, she's got possibilities -- let's see what Warners does with her next. The present movie is more than watchable, but if you were expecting another slice of THE LOONEY TUNES SHOW, forget it. The Macguffin is an invisibility formula accidentally created by Lola, for which she and Bugs are chased by absolutely everyone, pausing only for a couple of musical numbers. The one sung by Mac and Tosh is, of course, completely over the top, and they get to do more cross-dressing than Bugs (Bugs, by the way, wears heels in his scenes as a female flight attendant, and his calves are spectacular).

The disc's bonus cartoons are a random assortment: the Looney Tunes Show's pilot episode, three digital Road Runner cartoons from 2010, and a digital Sylvester & Tweety from 2011.",1445212800,4,1661,4.971223021582734
7158878,1,B00X5UIV9O,"Grabbed this at the local video rental store thinking it might have been one of the 1960's-80's Looney Tunes movies, you know the ones that are pretty much put together with old cartoons with a few new sequences to mesh the story, boy was I wrong. Wife and I only laughed a few times during the arduous 75 minutes. Only good thing I can say about this dvd is it included 4 bonus shorts that were hilarious; 3 Roadrunner & Wile coyote & Tweety & Sylvester I Tawt I Taw  a Puddy Tat. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this, just rent or borrow it and watch the 4 bonus shorts.",1443571200,,574,4.125
7158880,5,B00X5UIV9O,"This was an AWESOME movie! Easily the best Looney Tunes film since Space Jam, Rabbits Run perfectly combines the slapstick and wackiness of the original Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies shorts with the animation style and characterization of The Looney Tunes Show. I also enjoyed all of the allusions to both the original Looney Tunes and The Looney Tunes Show. I HIGHLY recommend Rabbits Run to anyone who is a fan the original series, the new series, or both.",1443225600,,457,4.9480519480519485

7158882,4,B00X5UIV9O,"I this Looney Tunes Show spin. It's a great combination of old-fashioned Looney Tunes slapstick with the recent show's sensibilities. This new voice of Lola channels her inner Kristen Wiig and I like it when Bugs Bunny gets the OTHER END of the slapstick. The only problem I had are the songs. It would have been better if they had been removed to make this a better flick. Otherwise this is highly recommended for fans of the New School Lola Bunny, Looney Tunes, and Warner fans alike. :D",1442102400,2,489,4.568181818181818
7158883,1,B00X5UIV9O,Our family watched this movie tonight and it was terrible. Storyline - bad. They pulled in EVERY one of the classic Looney Tunes Characters but they completely changed almost everything about them - from voice to personality to you name it. This is unfortunately the worse movie I've ever seen. The original artists that created these characters must be rolling over in their graves. Ugh...,1442016000,,390,5.015384615384615
7158884,3,B00X5UIV9O,"I purchased this film thinking it was a continuation of The Looney Tunes show, unfortunately I was mistaken. This movie reintroduces all characters with new backstories.
The writing is subpar. The animation is consistent with the most recent Looney Tunes show cartoon series.",1439596800,,275,5.4186046511627906
7158885,5,B00X5UIV9O,Best Looney Tunes movie ever. Love that the main character is Lola and that she and the Gophers get a song. I was thoroughly entertained and I recommend it highly to any Looney Tunes fan.,1439337600,,187,4.371428571428571
7158886,5,B00X5UIV9O,"Content: AWESOME! Near the beginning of the film, Lola Bunny does sing a song that does leans heavy on the Autotune, and is a bit painful, but then the movie kicks into high gear and the movie is fun and surprising through out.

These are most definitely The Looney Tunes Show versions of these characters, but without the history from the show. Lola talks endlessly, Bugs Bunny feels put-upon all the time. Daffy is a jerk, Speedy is understanding, but not putting up with disrespect. And the Gophers are in a relationship, so the being extraordinarily nice to each other has sort of gone out the window. (So cool!)

Foghorn Leghorn, Cecil the Turtle and Elmer Fudd are involved in a government plot to secret to mention that Lola Bunny inadvertently gets mixed
up in. Bugs, Daffy and Yosemite Sam get pulled along for the ride. A ride that takes us from New York to Paris and eventually Mars, because you can't have a Looney Tunes movie without Marvin the Martian.

Unlike many many many Looney Tunes movies from before, this is not cobbled together from old clips. This is all new animation. And a great ride.

Packaging: Fine. DVD in a light DVD Case (w/ the recycle holes) and a cardboard slip sleeve. (No Blu Ray or Ultraviolet included)

Languages:
Audio: English, Thai, French, Spanish, Portuguese
Subtitles: English, Thai, French, Spanish, Portuguese.

Special Features: GREAT! This DVD features the first episode of The Looney Tunes Show, Best Friends as well as 3 theatrical CGI Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote shorts, Coyote Falls, Fur A Flying, and Rabid Rider as well as a Tweety and Sylvester CGI theatrical short, I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat. These were released in theaters and on home video with various animated Warner Bros releases. But if you didn't see those movies, these are new to you.

Trailers: No front loaded trailers and only 2 in the special features. Scooby Vs KISS and the upcoming Batman Unlimited 2: Monsters Mayhem.

Buy/Dont Buy: Yes. Buy. This is a really fun movie. With Looney Tunes characters in parts big and small. This is probably the last time we will see these versions of these characters. Hopefully Warners will get around to releasing season 2 of The Looney Tunes show.  (Also season 3 of Duck Dodgers and seasons 2-5 of The Tweety and Sylvester Mysteries.)",1438819200,4,2302,4.74937343358396

7158888,5,B00X5UIV9O,"I also found this movie at Walmart about a week before it's general release.

I've been a big fan of The Looney Tunes Show ever since it first aired; I love the humor an the sitcom approach.  Honestly, I was never a HUGE fan of the original looney tunes, but this show really did something for me.  Same with the movie.  It's great, and hilarious, and all of the characterizations from the show are back.  However, it can barely be considered in continuity with the show because Bugs, Lola and Daffy all meet for the first time, which I'm not a totally fan of; I would have rather it be set definitively in the show's universe by having the likes of Bug's and Daffy's house present and have them all already know each other, but I suppose to appeal to a wider audience they chose the reboot-type approach, and it still ends up as a very entertaining movie. The animation, is also great, by the way.

My other major gripe with this is that Daffy didn't play a very major role.  The dynamics between him and Bugs is what the humor from the show usually derived from, and the short time hes in the film, he really shines and has a lot of memorable, funny moments, particularly when he decides to enjoy himself at the park while a frantic and action-packed chase happens all around him and he doesn't seem to care.  But, I suppose that the writers did not want to overuse him and his silliness; perhaps him only being in it for a little bit was to the movie's advantage.

Also, Lola Bunny's actress from the show (Kristin Wiig) has been replaced with Rachel Ramras (for some unknown reasons, possibly monetary or maybe just scheduling) and Ramras does an exceptional job as the goofy character.  She's also credited as the co-writer of the screenplay, so that's pretty neat too.

All in all, this movie is a good, funny movie that actually had some symbolism and themes, which was surprising.  I would recommend it to just about anyone.  All you have to do going into it is remember that these aren't the traditional Looney Tunes characters and accept them for what they are and you are sure to enjoy this movie.",1438128000,,2108,4.486910994764398

8715091,3,B00X5UIV9O,"Having just watched this movie, I'm impressed that Warner Brothers was willing to produce it.

Now I grant that tastes in humor vary and I'm more used to the pace and style of the classic animated shorts they used to feature at the theaters.
However . . . Throughout this entire show - I think I ""might"" have chuckled once, maybe twice.
It almost felt forced.

So - I'm having a bit of trouble with seeing how incredibly funny this was alleged to be.

I know that animation is hard to do.
So is creating a well written plot and script.

It's difficult to put a finger on what's not working this time around.
But just about every aspect of this cartoon didn't work for me.",1530748800,,671,4.301587301587301

8715094,4,B00X5UIV9O,This is the 3-DVD collection released by Warner Brothers. I brought this one as it was a better deal to get Rabbits Run with the two bonus movies instead of just buying Rabbits Run for a higher price. Rabbits Run is a really good movie with all new animation. If your a fan of The Looney Tunes Show I would recommend it. The Center Stage Vol 1 disc is just the third disc from the first Golden Collection release which I already had. The Bugs Bunny movie had new animation with old episodes mixed in. Overall a good price for what you receive.,1499040000,2,543,4.281553398058253
