This was originally posted at a really high dollar amt.

Its barely worth that.  Even for one such as myslef, who wants to collect hisotry, it
would be rather dumb to pay this kind of price.

Other recordsing by Jack Frank are definatley priced right at 1/10 or less.

If you really want this, you need to visit his website and buy direct from him.
REality is paying this amt for vhs tape is never good especially since portions of this particular product are on the other products he sells.  I have 3 of the Tulsa History series (originally vhs) and all 3 are avialable on on DVd for $19. And there are pieces of this vhs on that.",1299110400,2,709,4.2611940298507465
