8177425,1,B000NDIB2S,"I bought this dvd and a few others by ""timeless tales media"" and am very disappointed.  First of all I mistakenly thought this was the same Timeless Tales by Hallmark from the early 90's - it is not.  However, I think this company ""timeless tales media"" may have wanted customers to be fooled into thinking they were the original videos and capitalize on Hallmark's success.

The story is awful.  Nothing like the original fairytale.",1398816000,,433,4.8108108108108105
8177426,3,B000NDIB2S,"This movie is way, way different than the classic fairy tale I've been telling my grandsons, but for the price I can't complain. The shipping and handling were excellent, and I can't blame the vendor for disappointment  in the movie...he didn't direct it!",1392681600,2,255,4.930232558139535
8177427,1,B000NDIB2S,"Wasn't a good version of Hansel and Gretel. Really a still motion picture show.  For older children, not young ones.",1362614400,,116,4.8
8177428,5,B000NDIB2S,"The other customer who reviewed this product does not know what she is talking about. This rendition of Hansel and Gretel provides a unique twist on the classic tale. However, there is no stepmother plot involved; the story is about Hansel and Gretel going through a series of mishaps in the Dark Forest. This video is also very children-friendly, as there is no profanity or any sort of bad morals displayed. I grew up watching this, and i highly recommend it!",1338163200,3,461,4.703703703703703
8177429,1,B000NDIB2S,"After having read the original book to my 3 year old son, the story became an instant favorite.  We bought this DVD for him this Christmas based on the editorial review.  The review, however, turned out to be completely, 100% misleading.  The movie is nothing like the original story.  We feel duped.  Definitely not a ""Timeless Tale"" for us.  A real disappointment and a lame story.",1325721600,,383,4.7272727272727275
