6229863,5,B00HVIUTKU,"This is a fine film presenting the side of Justin Bieber obscured by sensational, exaggerated, half true, or false reports in the media. It does not address all the so called scandals but enough to show he is not what the media has portrayed him as. Furthermore, it presents concert highlights that show he is no fluke; he's genuinely talented with a stage presence unmatched by few male pop stars since M.J. To those that irrationally hate him, it probably won't make a difference, but many former non fans and haters are now fans.",1391990400,15,532,4.670212765957447

surprisingly it did not make me gag and was a decent story",1486944000,,119,4.0
6229867,5,B00HVIUTKU,"This video seemed to be a well-balanced portrayal of the public and private lives of Justin.  We all know Justin's public life, but this video also shows him to be, in many ways, just a regular person like the rest of us.  Justin has confidence but also insecurities--despite his many successes.  He seems to take his craft very seriously, wanting not just to perform, but to entertain his fans to the best of his ability.  It shows in the effort that he puts into his work.  There are many good singers, but the thing that makes Justin stand out is the way he delivers his songs--how he phrases them, how he expresses them, how he interprets them, and how he punctuates them.  He doesn't just own a song.  He makes listeners feel like they own the song, too.",1486252800,2,759,4.456521739130435

He's MEGA talented, funny, under-appreciated, and so misunderstood! The lyrics are so meaningful and inspiring.

6229906,1,B00HVIUTKU,"Let's just get this over with.  Normally, I would not bother with something like this, but after seeing what some of the positive reviewers have been saying, I REALLY have to take issue and put my foot down.

First of all, I really DO NOT care how ""hard"" this kid ""worked"" to ""get to where he is."" What you overly-hyped ""Beliebers"" FAIL to realize is that the only thing that got him to where he is is his image and his looks, coupled with a major record label that saw him as the perfect gimmick marketing tool to exploit and use to make money. There are musicians out there across a MULTITUDE of genres who work hundreds of times harder than he ever did, but despite their superior talent over him, their music is simply not ""marketable"" enough. Sad, but true. Simply put, no matter how talented he might be, the main thing that gets him his fame is one simple thing: MARKETING. Record companies today simply will not market someone who is unattractive, no matter HOW talented they are, and no matter how good and original their music is. Hell, if Justin decided he wanted to pursue his own honest, unique musical path and stand out from the cookie cutter crowd (that is, if he even CAN), his record company would strip him of his record deal virtually overnight, and would no longer support or promote him.

This miserable excuse of a movie is just another attempt at a cash grab from fans, whom he (along with his money-hungry record company) sees as nothing more than walking ATM machines. Not only that, but it is a giant sack of LIES aimed at further blinding the public into thinking that he is a sweet, innocent kid who could do no wrong. LOL, yeah... and Dan Aykroyd lives in my fish tank! The money and fame got to his head and turned him into a narcissistic, arrogant, pompous @$$#0|e who thinks he's better than everyone else, and knows nothing about music, art, or culture in general. He is a piece of trash and a waste of time, and I really hope that he comes to an utmost sticky end, just like every other teeny-idol clone who came before him (Leif Garrett, Aaron Carter, Lindsay Lohan, etc).

As far as anyone is concerned, his reign is just about over by now. Anyone who claims that he is a ""role model"" or is ""here to stay"" is in denial and needs a serious reality check. Seriously, learn what the industry is NOT telling you, and what the demons who run it don't want you to know. Anyone who has a clue as to how today's mainstream industry works can see right through this loser for what he really stands for. Enough said.

In response to those of you who are musically illiterate enough to compare this clown to Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, or even Frank Sinatra (!!), please read the best voted answer on this Yahoo! Answers thread here; It should be more than self-explanatory:

P.S. For those of you who would irrationally call me a ""low-life"" just for daring to speak the truth about your savior - I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less) and a VERY successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions. I certainly do not make millions, but NO ONE has to be a millionaire in order to survive or be considered successful. I am someone who has worked long and hard for my success, and I couldn't be any prouder of it. OWNED!",1414972800,,3378,4.573553719008265
6229907,5,B00HVIUTKU,I love the songs and everything about this dvd. its great to watch.,1414281600,,67,4.230769230769231
6229908,5,B00HVIUTKU,"We love Justin, so naturally we loved the DVD.",1413849600,,46,4.222222222222222
6229909,5,B00HVIUTKU,"Make no mistake about it. Justin Bieber is the Elvis of today's generation. As someone who works in the press (tho not entertainment press), I know how brutal the media can be to 'get the shot' or 'get it on camera' because the best shots, the most emotional shots, are the one's that rake in the biggest bucks. The paparazzi works relentlessly at pissing off celebrities, challenging them, saying whatever is necessary to catch them off guard just to catch the best money-making shot. And that's why the public sees mainly the bad stuff... because that's what we crave as a society... seeing someone at their worst, seeing that they're not perfect, seeing someone who's made a fall from grace.

Well, like most, I stand corrected. I'm a 65 year old grandmother with grandsons the same age as Justin. And I'm a music lover. With two older sisters, I grew up on Elvis, then the Beatles, then Michael Jackson, though ultimately I became a die-hard blues fan. Out of pure curiosity, I rented Justin's 'Believe' DVD, directed by Jon Chu, the other night. And man, what a delightful surprise.

Plain and simple, Justin Bieber works his ass off, not just on stage, but behind the scenes as well. He's a hands-on producer for his own shows, a song writer and plays piano, guitar and drums. I grew up in a music family where everyone had to play an instrument and trust me it takes practice, practice, practice to hone your art, which takes a lot of time each week. Justin plays 3 instruments plus sings and dances, which in and of itself is dozens of hours each week in choreography, practice, stretching, training and rehearsing.

Much of the movie is an account of Justin's life on the road (so far), all the hard work that goes into his shows with some 1500 employees, and how involved he is in the outcome of each production. You can clearly see Usher's influence on Justin in his rhythm, blues, soul, and dancing. (For those of you who don't know, Usher discovered Justin, and is his mentor and Scooter Braun is his manager) Yet, looking a little more closely at Justin on stage one comes to also see the influence of Elvis, Michael Jackson and John Lennon. When Justin was on stage, there were times when I saw the spirit of these other famous entertainers shine through. And having lived through all those generations it was easy to see the multiple influences.

Big kudo's to Justin's mom as well. As a single mother myself, I know how grueling it can be to raise children alone never mind a super star musical genius. In spite of the latter, and contrary to public opinion, this kid is very well grounded, kind, thoughtful and caring. And that my friends starts with the love, support and involvement of good parenting, being surrounded by positive people and grounded management.

Justin was only 19 when this film was made. From what I can tell, he's on the right track, not just musically, but spiritually as well. His music is aimed at a younger audience because he's a young guy but it's clear in the movie that this guy has a long illustrious future ahead of him. I'm no fortune teller but my guess is that he will not be taking the same path that led to the shortened lives of Elvis or Michael. I for one hope to live long enough to see what his next moves will be for decades to come.

Very impressed, movie was well done (kudos Jon Chu), Justin is a super star, not just because he's adorable and millions of girls are fainting worldwide when they see him, but because he works hard at it every single day. And that is his message in the movie. Believe. If you believe you can achieve, then you will. If you have an attitude of gratitude, then you will succeed. But it does take dedication, long hours and hard work, no matter which career path you choose for your life. Keep up the good work, Justin. To his mom, Scooter Braun, and Usher, a job very well done.

And with a new update -  Justin, your new look and kindness within is clearly shining outwardly. My mother lived her life and work by this motto: Have you had a kindness shown? Pass it on. T'was not given for you alone. Pass it on. Let it travel down the years, let it wipe another's tears, Till in heaven the deed appears, Pass it on. And that JB is exactly what you are doing for your millions of fans. I look forward to watching you grow and evolve as an artist and as a man... and living a very long successful life. Pass it on! Please add me to the list of Beliebers!",1413849600,17,4446,4.460024600246003
6229910,2,B00HVIUTKU,What a joke this guy has become! It is a good thing our youth are so stupid! Justin is laughing all the way to the bank and regret helping him. I just wanted to give it an honest look. He is exactly how I imagined him to be.,1411344000,,224,3.6875

I like Bieber's music just fine - and knew more about his penchant for driving too fast and his many hair styles than I did about him as a person.  But this is a very compelling movie. It's a revealing window into his life behind the scenes. It feels personal.  He feels vulnerable. He feels real.  And it's clear that he plays a very active role in his career. Despite his young age, he is making the decisions - large and small. He doesn't feel ""managed.""  I'll admit it - count me as a Belieber.",1403740800,4,595,4.276785714285714

6229943,1,B00HVIUTKU,"Here's the thing: If you love the Beebs, you are going to love this movie.  If you are a sane human being, with any hope for our youth and/or self-respect, you will call it what it is.  A PR stunt and a shameless grab for fan cash.  This movie presents Bieber as if he is something wonderful, some incredible talent, little white Michael Jackson taking the world by storm.  NO.  Just . . . no.

His actions in real life reveal what he truly is, so try searching them out.  If you are that interested in his life and personality, try getting a well-rounded view.  As for the movie, it is a mindless trip through a spoiled little boy's life.  Ostensibly meant to inspire, it will more likely tire and bore you.

It is a nauseating display of people loving the camera turned on them.  Remember the good old days when musicians had to prove their worth via their music?  Now, it seems that reality melodrama is the key to ripping off the fans.

Believe is a big rip off.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Go watch concert footage of a few real musicians.",1398902400,8,1038,4.305699481865285

This DVD is so great for those of us who have been able to see him in concert to be able to see what we missed from our seats.  It's also great for those who haven't had a chance yet to see him to see what his concerts are like.  We had to buy this DVD on release day and it's great!!,1396915200,5,454,3.5656565656565657

6229968,5,B00HVIUTKU,I've been a belieber since 2009 and this movie really helps show how hes grown and how things are different from the first movie. Believe shows how much he loves music and the he pours himself into his music. It also shows that he has amazing connection with his fans that other celebrities don't have. I believe everyone should watch this movie because it shows hes down to earth and nothing like the headlines say he is. He truly is a wonderful person.,1395792000,3,454,4.481927710843373
