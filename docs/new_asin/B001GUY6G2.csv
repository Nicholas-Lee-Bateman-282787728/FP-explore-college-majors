A group of businessmen meet in conference to make a decision about the early retirement of a colleague. Charlie Adams is the new owner of a Las Vegas casino (which puts him in conflict with his competition). He is in charge of the entire West Coast and wants to invest in Las Vegas. But the owner Abe doesnt want to sell the Royal Towers. A man is released from prison, pardoned after twelve years. A friend meets him, they drive across the San Francisco Bay Bridge. McCain is needed for a job. He wanders around to see the tourist attractions, then meets a young woman, Irene. They become very friendly. They plan to knock over the Royal casino. But McCain wants to do it his way.

He visits and walks around the floor. McCains son talks to Adamo, is there a plot? Irene rolls the dice. Abe reports to the real owners in New York City. Charlie practices boxing in a gym, he learns about the surprise visitors from New York City. Frank and his wife arrive. The men talk business. Charlie was told to stay out of Reno and Las Vegas; he objects then apologizes. Hank marries Irene. Johnny Rocco meets Hank to tell him of a change in plans. Charlie is upset about Hanks absence. Hank is told about his sons associates; he wants a machine gun. That night Frank meets his son, then he greets two strangers. Mr. De Marco visits Charlie the next day and invites him to Las Vegas. Then he says goodbye to his son.

Theyll make peace. Hank unpacks an addition to his red sedan. They show scenes of Las Vegas at night. Hank enters a casino and places small boxes in place. Then he dresses in a uniform. Bombs explode, firemen answer the call. Hank drives away in a red car. There are explosives in that casino. People scream and run! A masked fireman arrives. Gas grenades add to the confusion. A man grabs valuables. Irene meets Hank, who switches cars. The casino owner s count their loss, $1.8 million.

Insurance will cover the losses of their patrons. De Marco blames the problem on a defective air conditioner. But he suspects McCain was behind this robbery. Charlie Adamo and his friend are punished. McCain and Irene are hunted now! They escape from an auto junkyard. A car chases them but they escape. McCain meets an old girlfriend, she is the only one he can trust. Rosemary goes for Irene, she arranged for a boat trip. But Mrs. Scott has visitors! Will she talk? No! McCain goes to that boat and sees strange men, they have Irene. Irene doesnt walk all the wayto the boat. Other men arrive in cars, they are armed. It ends.

This story reminds me of High Sierra but with a different ending. Stealing from organized crime is not a good career move. The mob knows the likely suspects, they are not hampered by rules and regulations.",1497916800,,2764,4.487077534791252
