8675270,1,B00MXYG2LW,Worthless!  Complete garbage!  Not even worth watching.  Deceiving title!  What does this have to do with Gary Busey or Tombstone?,1532995200,,130,5.35
8675271,2,B00MXYG2LW,Very misleading description.  One of the six movies had Sam Elliott  in it and it wasn't one of his better films.  The other 5 were not worth watching other than viewing enough of each to realize it.  Save your money on this one.,1529539200,,229,4.255813953488372

8675278,2,B00MXYG2LW,"I watched a couple of these Movies, they were obvious done Europe, the story lines were boring, if you like Spaghetti Westerns then you may like these Films, as for me it was waste of money.",1447977600,6,190,4.305555555555555
