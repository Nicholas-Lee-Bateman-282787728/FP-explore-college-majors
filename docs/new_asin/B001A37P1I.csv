8275843,4,B001A37P1I,Very good Marisol musical comedy-drama film.  Marisol plays a Pollyanna type of girl who is orphaned and come to live with her uncle and his family.  Her snooty aunt and some of her cousins treat her more like a servant and are not appreciative of her attempts to help them when they start to fall into hard times.  I would love to see this film released to US DVD.,1377302400,,365,4.260869565217392
