1462697,5,B00005JIX4,"Orphen is a witty little series with nice animation and loveable characters.  The story revolves around its namesake, Orphen, a lazy sorcerer who has resided in a small town for a year (and done nothing).  The story truly begins when Orphen and his apprentice, Majic, are caught 'birdwatching' by the spoiled heiress Cleo.  Outraged, she storms out of her home with the sword of Baltanders and attempts to dice Orphen with it.  He notices which sword she is using and tells her to put it away, but to no avail as the sky darkens and black lightning begins to strike.  The owner of the darkness is a dragon known as the Bloody August, whom Orphen calls Azuli.  He attempts to bind the dragon, but he is stopped by another spellcaster and she escapes.  Orphen takes the sword of Baltanders so that Azuli will not try to harm Cleo or her (ditzy) sister Mariabelle in order to get it.  He does so in vain as Azuli takes the girls away as ransom for the sword which she believes can deliver her.  Orphen follows Azuli in order to rescue the girls and try to save her.  Once again he is intercepted by the two sorcerers of the school that he ran away from and Azuli again escapes and the sword is stolen by the trolls, Dortin and Vulcan.  The journey begins as Orphen, Majic, and the stowaway Cleo attempt to take back the sword of Baltanders.  Orphen is a lovely little anime that lovers of comedy and fantasy shouldn't pass up.",995932800,3,1423,4.4517374517374515
1462698,5,B00005JIX4,"The full name to this anime is ""Sorcerous Stabber Orphen"".  It's been out in Japan for a while, but was just released here very recently.
The story revolves around Oprhen. A powerful sorcerer  that left the Tower of Fame ( A place where people go to train to become Sorcerers and many powerful sorcerers dwell.) five years ago against the will of the leaders of the tower. And they still want him back because of his power.  Orphen is trying to stop a Black Dragon known as ""The Bloody August"".  I won't get into why because I don't want to ruin anything for anyone. All of the characters in Orphen are likeable and all have voices that suit them very well. Orphen of course, is the coolest looking and sounding character in the the anime. My only real gripe is with his apprentice Majic. His voice sounds too squeaky. Cleo sounds like just like a spoiled rich girl (Which she is.) and it suits her rather well. A lot of the humor in this anime comes from two stumpy little guys called trolls. But all of the other character will have some pretty funny things to say. This anime does not solely rely on humor though. Once the action starts it usually gets pretty serious.
I liked this one a lot and I hope that you do too.",995932800,,1222,4.3464912280701755
1462699,5,B00005JIX4,"I think this anime was well dubbed and has a plot line that will keep you on the edge of your seat half the time and rolling on the floor laughing for the other half. If you like Magic, Swords, Dragons and Mystery, then this is the anime for you!
I bought this anime without really knowing anything about it except that the cover looked cool and the summery on the back sounded interesting. To my surprise, I really enjoyed this anime alot more than I thought i would and am eager to know what will happen next!
Don't miss this anime! It is a must have for any collection!  :)

1462700,5,B00005JIX4,"I happened to catch an episode of Orphen while I was at the  Comic-Con convention this year.  Since I was watching the 3rd episode of the series, it didn't make a whole lot of sense. But, with an arrogant yet cute hero such as Orphen, anyone  is bond to be hooked on the series! The animation is of  excellant quality along with the japanese voice cast. My only dissatification with the DVD was that there was only 3 episodes. Also, they could have had some better extras. Otherwise, this
is a must-see for any anime fan!",995760000,,521,4.395833333333333
1462701,5,B00005JIX4,"When I was at the video store I saw this DVD on the rack and it just jumped out at me. I picked it up and I instantly wanted it, flipping it over and reading the back made me want it more!! When I turned it on, I was introduced to a whole new world of anime. Orphen-Spell of the Dragon is the first volume in a great series. The music is amazing, I found myself turning up the volume and just getting into it. Then the show started...I was hooked from scene one. The voices are great. This show has everything, action, comedy, hot girls, and really cool bad guys. This DVD has alot of extras too, textless opening and ending, art, and more. This DVD is defiantly a compliment to any anime collection!!",995500800,,701,4.2
1462702,5,B00005JIX4,"Ever since I saw a picture of the Sorcerous Stabber Orphen while scanning the net (which, when clicked on, led me to a whole site devoted to the man), I've been intrigued by this anime. Then the video game came out and I was even more interested in it, as it showed potential beyond your basic sorcery anime. Now this DVD has finally been released, and I have to say that if they don't up the September date, I'm gonna die.
Orphen was everything I hoped it would be. A hotshot hero is always welcome, and his intricate personlity draws you into the storyline immediately. Our man Orphen is a star student of his sorcery school, or should I say was... since he's run away, looking for a dragon called the Bloody August. Now he's got to keep his old comrades and teachers off his back, and at the same time balance a pupil and a tag-along heiress. What's a guy to do?
The humor is refreshingly balanced with the plot, and the animation is simply beautiful. Not only that, but the dub is excellent. Each voice fits perfectly and they all do a great job, and we all know how rare that is. The DVD is set up well... they play around with interactive menus (as opposed to what, i always wonder) and there's a nice slideshow of character sketches.
Orphen is an anime I highly reccomend. It's fun to watch for all ages, and a great anime to get your friends hooked. Heck, it's even one you might wanna try out on your parents if you're feeling lucky! So be smart and buy it. You won't regret it, I'll promise ya that.",995155200,3,1509,4.316901408450704
1462703,4,B00005JIX4,"I first got a glimpse of Orphen at my fist con, AMA. They showed the three episode, which I think are all that's on the DVD, which is sort of disapointing, but in the way of the animation, this anime immediatly caught my attention. It was actually the talk of the con for a good while after it was shown, and I immediatly came here to find out when and if the DVD was coming out. I was happy to find that it was.
The story starts out in what seems to be the middle of a complex storyline. Orphen is a sorcerer of some power, who left the Tower of Fang, where he trained. He picks up an apprentance called Majic (yes, it's pronounce just like magic) in a small town where he is also doing a little 'birdwatching' and no, it's not what you think at first either. The storyline picks up very quickly after a little bit of introduction, when a dragon called bloody august shows up, and it's even more interesting that Orphen seems to know the dragon. The series has a good amount of comedy, brought by two short trolls, and a girl who is tha wanna be love interest of Orphen (I find her kinda annoying, but berable), plus having Orphen do a good amount of angsting in only three episodes. I think it does a good job of bringing both of these elements together nicely, and I'm hoping that with the release of these DVDs, they'll be an upsurge of good websites for him as well.
I don't know much about the extras on the DVD, since I don't own it quite yet, but ADV isn't exactly known for having lots of extras, only trailers really. Evangelion only had the character bios, so this DVD may have that. The opening and closing themes are really good too.
All and all, give this series a shot, because it's really good, and Orphen's cute to boot.",993859200,5,1737,4.2507552870090635

1462916,3,B00005JIX4,"This is a comedy adventure in a fantasy setting like Slayers, Ruin Explorers, Dragon Half, Sorcerer Hunters, Bastard, etc. It is fun and very comfortable for those who enjoy the genre but does nothing to stand out from the crowd. It is the same group of likable characters that you tend to see in other comedic adventure anime. It is not as funny as Dragon Half and doesn't quite have the charm of Ruin Explorers, I think it would be best described as slightly more serious Slayers with a male protagonist.
The streaming version is dubbed and is not afflicted by the buffering problem that many of the new Prime anime streaming releases have.
The draw back is that season 1 is at the time of this review, is still for pay to Prime members. This means that the free streaming of season 2 is a little out of place.
I would not say that the series is good enough to pay 2$ per episode to see season 1 in preparation for watching this season, though one might consider buying the DVD box set or just waiting for them to put season 1 on Prime.",1350950400,,1038,4.328205128205128
1462917,5,B00005JIX4,"Orphen is not your usual fantasy sorcerer -- he's young, brash, dresses like a minor-league rock'n'roll musician, and  has a mission that sets him against all other sorcerers.

Fortunately, he's also just one awesome part of ""Orphen - Spell of the Dragon (Vol. 1),"" the first volume of an action-packed fantasy anime that starts off strong with lots of monsters, fiery fights and warring spells. It only has three episodes, but they're still worth it -- many questions are raised and plot threads are woven together, mixed in with a healthy dose of comedy, a bit of romance, and a LOT of spell-slinging action.

For the last year, Orphen has been hanging around the village of Totokanta, doing nothing except spying on the local wealthy family, and teaching minor spells to his new apprentice Majik. But then one of the daughters of said wealthy family, the sharp-tongued Cleao, thinks she's caught Orphen peeping on her room. So she attacks him with a rune-covered sword... just in time for the sky to darken, ghosts rise, and the terrible dragon Bloody August descends on the town

The weird thing is, Orphen seems to know this dragon. Not only does he call it ""Azalie,"" but he tries to seal rather than killing it.

However, his spells are soon thwarted, and Orphen soon finds that the Tower of Fang's greatest sorcerers are coming to find him, hoping that he will return to them (and give them the sword). Obviously Orphen tells them to get stuffed. And when Cleao and her sister are kidnapped by Bloody August, Orphen is given a terrible choice -- he must give the sword to the dragon if he wants the sisters returned. But that won't be enough to stop the sorcerer Childman and the Tower of Fang from pursuing both Orphen and the dragon...

One thing you will have after watching ""Orphen - Spell of the Dragon"" is questions -- who's Azalie and who is she to Orphen? How did she become a dragon? What does the Tower of Fang want with the Sword of Baltanders? What is the nature of the sword and what does it do? And why hasn't Orphen killed Volcan for being too annoying to live? Obviously since this is the series' beginning, none of these questions are answered just yet...

In the meantime, these three episodes form one tightly-woven little story, which introduces the main story arc and the cast. There's lots of flashy spells, warring sorcerers, crumbling ruins, bloated dragons and quaint little towns that seem to hover somewhere between the medieval and the modern (a root beer float?). There's plenty of comic relief -- some from dialogue (""Oh all right, I spit it out!"") and some from the action (Orphen being mistaken for a peeping tom). But there's a thread of sadness running through the stories, as Orphen's lonely quest is revealed and we see how much he's sacrificed.

The one downside -- those trolls are not only annoying, but pretty much unnecessary. Okay, it's fun to see Orphen blast them into orbit when Volcan threatens him with a mop, but that's it.

Fortunately, the other characters are far more endearing -- Orphen is a rough-edged, superpowerful anti-hero who obviously has some dark shadows in his past, and is surprisingly kind to others. Majik serves as the naive ""little brother"" figure who is wilier than he sometimes appears, while Cleao is sharp-tongued and bombastic; while she can be annoying at times, she also is smart and brave enough to round out the trio nicely. As for the other sorcerers... we'll have to wait and see.

""Orphen - Spell of the Dragon (Vol. 1)"" expertly spins together the first colorful threads of an epic fantasy anime, full of blazing spells and half-hidden monsters. A rollicking good time, but with shadows that promise to make what comes next even better.",1258329600,,3725,4.752321981424148
1462918,4,B00005JIX4,"For the record, the beginning of  ""Orphen Revenge"" is not very much like the first season of ""Orphen"" -- it's more like a grumpier version of ""Slayers.""

Not that that's an entirely bad thing -- just different. ""Orphen Season 2 - Revenge (Vol. 1)"" is a rather fluffy beginning to the series' second season, with plenty of comic relief, a bit of gender-bending, and Orphen's increasingly stressful search for hot water and food. But there are some subtle (okay, not subtle) hints that there's something nasty in the offing for Orphen and Co., which may have inspired the sub-title ""Revenge.""

A very reluctant Orphen and Majik set out with Cleao to the city of Seiun, reknowned for its hot springs. But when the hotel owners see Orphen's face, then immediately freak out and reject the trio -- mainly because the town's tinpot dictator Don Bonaparte is terrified that a sorcerer will discover their secret. Desperate to get Cleao into a hot spring so they can leave, Orphen blasts his way to the source of Don Bonaparte's hot springs... only to discover a shocking secret in a nearby mountain.

He also encounters Lycoris, an agent of the Royal Public Order of Knighthood who says that they want him -- and of course, Orphen is totally uninterested. But he lets Lycoris tag along because the Order will pay his bills.

And Orphen has non-knighthood problems to deal with: enormous freakish monsters keep attacking the party, and seem to be targeting him alone. A bizarre incident convinces Cleao that the inoffensive Lycoris is a tentacled monster out to ""eat our sweet sweet brains!"", and the bombastic troll Volcan becomes possessed by a very feminine ghost who needs to skip stones in a magical lake. Yes, he does wear a dress.

There's not much story substance to the first volume of ""Orphen Revenge"" -- it's mostly about our heroes meandering around and being attacked by monsters, when Orphen's companions aren't slowly driving him insane with stress (""MY FRIEND.... NEEDS... A BAAAAAAAATH!""). But there are some plot threads of darker stuff -- a shadowy figure that is plotting Orphen's downfall, and a bunch of monsters with nebulous origins.

And along the way, there's some action-comedy worthy of ""Slayers"" -- lots of Orphen blowing things up and kicking butt against increasingly bizarre foes (such as possessed mannequins with sickles!), usually yelling abuse at them. And the fluffy plots have as plenty of comic relief and running jokes (Lycoris loses her glasses every time there's a literal bump in the road); the entire fourth episode is basically comedic fluff that rides on the idea of Volcan in a frilly pink dress.

And while the English dub dialogue rarely matches the original Japanese (Orphen's attack names are usually rewritten as macho yells of ""Show me what you're made of!"" et cetera), it tends to be snappy and amusing (""That's an interesting point you make, Cleao... and by interesting, I mean STUPID!""). David Matranga gives Orphen a rough-edged, mildly sarcastic voice, while Shelley Calene-Black, Spike Spencer and Luci Christian do excellent jobs as well.

Orphen himself seems to have gotten over the angst of the previous season -- he's sarcastic, grumpy, and perpetually surrounded by idiots and annoyances who make his life far more stressful than it needs to be. I mean, the poor guy can't even sleep in his own bed without Cleao blowing him up, forcing him to repair the hotel, and then dragging him off on her hunt for the perfect spa. No wonder he blows off steam by tying up Majik.

Cleao herself is a fun character, an arrogant ""princess"" type who is more perceptive than people assume and definitely gutsy enough to tell off local dictators. Majik is a suitably mild-mannered sidekick, and Lycoris is an unusual addition to the cast -- a timid, prim gal with glasses, braids and an iron-clad determination to drag Orphen into knighthood. The only flaws are Volcan and Dirtan, who continue to be as funny as an infected boil.

With some hints of future dark'n'nasty events to come, the first volume of ""Orphen Revenge"" is nevertheless a fluffy affair balanced out between action and comedy. Worth watching, and continuing with it.",1245196800,,4175,4.924608819345662
1462919,5,B00005JIX4,"I bought this disc on a fluke, because I really enjoyed David Matranga's voice work in the series ""Saiyuki"", and wanted to own more of his work.  Not only is the series well written, but the English dub is (to me at least) funnier than the original Japanese version (and before anyone says anything, I'm legally blind and it's much easier for me to hear the voice rather than trying to read off the TV).",1206489600,,403,4.373333333333333

1463000,4,B00005JIX4,"Orphen Season 1 gets 5 stars...unfortunately season two only gets 4.  Season has a story, but the viewer must find it amongst the comedy.  Orphen, Magic, Cleo and Leki (voiced by the same voice actors from the first Orphen) are going to some hot springs for a little R & R.  Once they reach the resort town they discover that no one wants to give them any shelter.  Also a mysterious glasses-dependent girl is following them, she wants Orphen's help (the reason is never made clear in any of the four episodes).  Volkin and Dortin still refuse to pay their debt and someone is out to get Orphen...but who and why?
The animation is NOT as good as the first.  The characters seem to have lost weight and look more cartoonish.  What I find strange is that when Orphen uses his powers the background is reminiscent of some 60's psychedelic drug-induced vision.  The outtakes are a special treat (I enjoyed their references to ""American Pie"" and Eddie Murphie's ""The Nutty Professor"").
If your an Orphen fan you will enjoy it but if your not familiar with Orphen I STRONGLY suggest you watch the first season before you see season two.  Enjoy the story and small touches of humor of season one before you dive into the comedy saturated season 2.
If you're a parent, its best not to let your small children see this (the opening sequence has Orphen and Cleo in bed together, the first comedic sequence soon follows) and the language used in the outtakes are best appreciated by a mature ear.",1071705600,,1485,4.59469696969697
1463001,5,B00005JIX4,"This DVD was a total impulse buy, and looking back, I'm very glad I was so eager to spend my money on that day.
First off, I am not a fan of fantasy. Having said that, I'm not quite sure what drew me to this title, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
One of my favorite things about this anime is Orphen himself - he does not look like your typical main character. With his leather jacket, black pants, and red headband, he looks like a bad guy, but looks are decieving. Orphen is a very interesting character with a mysterious past, and by the end of the first episode, the viewer knows that there's a lot more to this story than they've been shown so far.
These first three episodes are like a trilogy; they all run into each other to make one long story designed to introduce us to the anime, and it does this well. We are introduced to Orphen's student Majik and a girl named Cleo who has a crush on Orphen, but would never admit it. We also meet the troll Volcan and his sister, Dortan. Volcan's anti-Orphen attitude is quite amusing, though he can become quite annoying at times.
This show has well-placed comedy and a very good story; one that left me excited and interested in what the next volume held in store. Needless to say, I threw the second disc in my DVD player as soon as the third episode finished.
What amazes me most is that this show could have such a strong hold on me when I'm not particularly into fantasy. I definitely recommend this show - it doesn't get enough recognition.",1067817600,,1494,4.320284697508897
1463002,5,B00005JIX4,"Now for those of you who played the dismall PS2 game titled ""Orphen,"" I want you to forget that period in your life.... Now that you have done that...sit down and get your hands on this anime. It combines a well organized plot with the commical antics of those involved in the story.
The plot in itself is amazing, purely because it takes until the last episode to have every piece in place. Most movies leave you with a few pieces missing or too quickly bring them all into focus. This story spawns over many years with flash backs that lead the viewer a bit closer into the world that is being displayed. This anime's plot is worth five stars in itself actually and is far more evolved then most animes on the market these days.
Orphen also uses top notch animation. The characters are well draw and look more realistic then most on the market today. The spell casting and action sequences are gripping. The humor animation really adds to the jokes as well.
The music track has a few decent scores, but overall is quite average. The voice overs are really really really good. I can't say it enough, they are great. I really can't say it enough, I love the voice actors for this series. If they do a sequal series, they had better have the same voice actors.
The lighter comedy aspects of this story are wonderful as well. They are well placed and don't detract from serious scenes. Some of it is so funny because of the randomness. If you love comedy I suggest this series strongly.
So overall this series is what real animation is about. Funny, serious, story to die for, great animation and great voice overs. A truely excellent series that I hope has a sequal.",1034467200,6,1665,4.480263157894737

1463004,5,B00005JIX4,"I remember seeing the cover to the first volume of the Orphen DVD, Spell of the Dragon. I also remember saying, ""Hey, looks cool"" and five minutes later I was walking out of the store with a new DVD in hand, and thirty dollars shorter than before. Yet, when I popped it into my DVD player, I realized that this was a real keeper.
Orphen starts out just about the same way as any other anime or TV series does. The characters are introduced: Orphen, the main character, and his I-don't-care attitude, Majik the innocent apprentice, and Cleao the annoyingly stubborn girl that gets sucked into the plot by a twist of fate. Seeming too cliche for you? Well then, perhaps I forgot to mention the unwelcome teachers from Orphen's past chasing after him. Or maybe the fact that Orphen is trying to save a terrifying dragon named the Bloody August from those teachers for his own personal reasons.
Yes, it's the lovely thing called foreshadowing that makes us want to throw down another thirty bucks for the next DVD, and it works so wonderfully. Granted, there are only 3 episodes on this certain volume, but there is so much promise in these three episodes that you can't help but love it. Characters quickly begin to develop and plot quickly begins to thicken. Yet beneath all the dark thoughts and mysterious memories, there's comedy that will put a smile on your face. The sarcastic attitude of Orphen is what made me laugh, and get this, it was the ENGLISH track that did it.
Yes, you heard me right, the ENGLISH track. The voice acting is professional and doesn't sound forced like most anime. I actually think that the American dialogue was much sharper than the original, but maybe that's just because I'm not Japanese. But in any case, there's something to be said about the translation job in the Orphen series. It's so surprisingly good...it's almost scary.
Orphen is for just about anyone who enjoys some good magic action every now and then, and perhaps for even the people that don't. Give it a try and decide for yourself.",1027296000,16,2031,4.66016713091922
1463005,4,B00005JIX4,"Despite being a hardcore anime fan, I had never heard of Orphen before I purchased this DVD.  I had previously explored what I consider to be two of the best anime's of all time, Rurouni Kenshin and Trigun.  Orphen is a superb anime, however, it will not be removing these anime's from their throne.  The action is quite enjoyable, although action sequences are few.  The storyline is deep and enchanting, the humour is insanely funny, and Orphen himself rocks!  This is not an anime to pass up!  Be sure to check out Trigun, Rurouni Kenshin, Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Spriggan, Princess Mononoke, Ninja Scroll, and Wrath of the Ninja!",1024617600,,648,4.845454545454546
1463006,4,B00005JIX4,"My first experience with Orphen was with the PS2 game.  While I do agree with many of the negative remarks about the game, I ended up liking it a decent amount simply because the relationships between the five pre-existing characters (Cleo, Magnus AKA Majik, Vulcon, Dortin and, of course, Orphen) was unlike any other RPG or story I had encountered.  Orphen was only a hero for two reasons: 1) he was incredibly good at sorcery, and 2) being a hero meant he got to get off that stupid crazy deathtrap island.  Orphen is a hero who is lazy, greedy, and usually doesn't give a damn.  He travels with two companions, who constantly annoy the hell out of him.  That was amusing!
So, soon afterward, I heard that it was based on an anime series, and after some searching, I stumbled upon this DVD in the ""New Releases"" section at a local movie store.  I popped it in, and I was quite pleased.  The attitude, while toned down (due to it being the first episode -- the tension hadn't built up yet) was the same.  The best part is right at the end, where Cleo says to Orphen: ""I can be nice and caring if I wanted to be!"" and Orphen replies with a tone I came to expect: ""No you couldn't.""
The plot in this trilogy of episodes is quite marvelous.  It's about Orphen hunting down an evil dragon called ""The Bloody August,""  but it's really not a good vs. evil scenario, since it would seem Orphen is slightly evil, but rather it's a better evil taming the worse evil.  While Orphen is aiding the evil dragon, while also protecting the good from it, he is being hunted by his former collegue sorcerors who want to destroy the dragon, because there is a story behind the dragon they do not know.  I won't spoil it; see it.
My final verdict is that this DVD is quite nice.  Both tracks are amusing, since both are well acted, and the writing in both are actually different (the American track is meaner).  While each episode is short, and it would be accurate to state that the first episode of the trilogy is really just character development of Orphen, Cleo and Majik.  It is dramaic, comedic, and fantastic.  Now that a second DVD is out, and a third on the way, I cannot wait!  I hope it only gets better!",1005523200,3,2198,4.374384236453202
1463007,2,B00005JIX4,"While Orphen, Spell of the Dragon, tells an interesting story and is well animated my overall impression was kind of disappointing. The DVD contains only 3 episodes, each of about 20 minutes, the rest is opening, end-titling and even the stop/start shots where on TV the commercials are inserted. After the 3 episodes were done they left me with the impression of having seen about 1 episode of a longer anime. So what it inspired in me was a sense of having wasted money, rather than of having seen a nice anime. My advice, don't buy it unless you are an absolute Orphen fan.",997056000,2,576,4.548076923076923
1463008,5,B00005JIX4,"Another excellent start to another excellent anime... After knowing nothing about this anime initially, I was hooked from the first ep. Orphen and co. battle a dragon ( and each other ^^) and then set out for adventure on the open road. All charas get equal time in the first three eps and you can already see the dynamic between them as they start on new adventures together. DVD quality is top-notch,as expected from ADV (as someone commented upon entering my room while watching this DVD ""Is that a DVD? It's so crisp-looking!"" ) Anyway, bottom line is you need to hurry out to get this first chapter in this new anime series. I personally can't wait for vol 2! Forget the mediocre PS2 game and go for the anime original! You'll be glad ya did! ^_-",996278400,,751,4.489051094890511

The art is an obvious disappointment as its is reduced to mostly overly emotional faces typical of (manga?) and most of the small details from season one are gone...One ex is Orphen's necklace that often looks like a bland grey plop with an outline closer to that of a bat.... I continually cringed at the overly done dramatics between Orphen and Cleo. Not typical to good anime is the fighting for the bath's as there is no rhyme or reason or dramatic explanation other than this group of people dressed like...(arabians?) don't want a sorcerer to find out the secret o the baths..which in ep 1, Orphen and the others don't even contemplate. The characters just don't seem to have a vibe. Comparative to season 1, season two has continuing ep that carry over several ep.",1438560000,,813,4.613793103448276
