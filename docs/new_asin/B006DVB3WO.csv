4984021,5,B006DVB3WO,"""Snow White"" has always been my absolute favorite of the Grimm Brothers fairy tales.  I watch any adaptation of this tale I can get my hands on.  This version strays from the original in many ways, but the plot is epic and entertaining.

Two lands exist side by side in perfect harmony.  A kind king and his queen rule the first, and Prince Alexander governs the second.  Peace is maintained through a mystical source known as the Viridian Flame.  However, even in lands of peace, corruption can be born.  Queen Gwendolyn, (Eliza Bennett), desires to take possession of the Viridian Flame and use it to gain power over both kingdoms.  In order to do this, she craftily orchestrates events that will result in the death of her husband.
In Alexander's kingdom, the infection of evil threatens to violate and destroy his subjects.  The Viridian Flame rests on his land, but death and deception is causing it to grow weaker every day.  Unaware that Queen Gwendolyn is behind the evil, Alexander desires to marry her so that both kingdoms can be united.  Gwendolyn's stepdaughter, Snow White, returns from her life in a convent.  When Prince Alexander meets the princess, he falls in love. The queen's jealousy drives her to seek to destroy her stepdaughter.  Will Gwendolyn acquire the flame for her own evil uses? Will her seductive charms bring ruination to Prince Alexander?  Who will be the hero in this delightful film?

I know I am in the minority here, but I thought the story was wonderfully presented.  Being a blind individual, I cannot comment on the visual effects.  However, I loved the plot and characters.  The movie is not meant to be deep.  ""Grimm's Snow White"" is a classic tale for those who enjoy good versus evil stories.  Purists will not enjoy this, but if you keep an open mind, you might find that the movie is fun.  Eliza Bennett was particularly wonderful as Queen Gwendolyn, and it was nice to see a younger woman playing the villainness.  Her portrayal of the queen truly embodied the seductive allure of evil.

I also thought it was interesting having elves featured in the story.  They gave the movie an otherworldly feel.  My favorite character is Isabella, an elf who embarks upon a journey of self-discovery.  She must face her fears and determine where her loyalties truly lie.

Please give this film a chance.  God bless you all.",1334707200,9,2361,4.762962962962963

4984026,1,B006DVB3WO,"Everyone knows the story of Snow White: an evil queen becomes jealous of her beautiful stepdaughter, but the princess is saved by seven dwarves in the forest. The Brothers Grimm apparently forgot to mention the elves, cliche prophecy, magic meteorite and the giant death lizards.

Yeah, the Asylum's ""Grimm's Snow White"" has as much to do with the classic fairy tale as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" had to do with the book -- and it's the only adaptation bad enough to actually make the upcoming ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and ""Mirror Mirror"" movies look promising. It's cheap, wooden and rips off ""Lord of the Rings.""

When the king is killed, evil Queen Gwendolyn (Jane March) immediately plots to marry the prince of a neighboring country, Alexander (Jamie Thomas King). Her scheme is to eradicate the elves on his land, and then take possession of a mystical green flaming rock that contains all the world's magic.

But then the prince becomes smitten with her stepdaughter, Snow White (Eliza Bennett). So the queen tries to have Snow White killed in the woods, only for her to be saved by a band of generic D&D elves. Now a war will break out between the elves and the queen's army, with the fate of Snow White as the deciding factor.... nah, actually it's the prince.

""Grimm's Snow White"" is a cheap, cheap movie. The CGI wargs and lizards are horrendously bad, the entire cast is perhaps forty people, and the same country house is used for two different castles. In fact, some scenes feel like someone was staging a remake of ""Lord of the Rings"" on a budget of $25.03.

But really, I could overlook those things if they had a good story to back it up. And... they don't. The plot has all these gaping holes in it (why does being prettier than Snow White matter? IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUEEN'S MOTIVES!). Every time things get too dull, the movie throws CGI monsters or inexplicable traitors at us, and hopes we won't notice.

Eliza Bennett (no, not the Jane Austen one) is pretty awful. She's not pretty enough to be the ""fairest of them all,"" and her blonde hair and blue dress make her look more like Alice than Snow White. She also has the acting range of a cinder block.

March is decent as the evil queen, even if she is basically a Bond villain in ugly hats. Most of the elves and soldiers are barely characters at all, and most of them don't seem to speak English. King is the only one who gives a really good performance, and he gives the role his all. He deserves to be in a better ""Snow White"" movie.

""Grimm's Snow White"" has some mild entertainment for the kitsch value and King's performance, but the rest of it ends up making you scratch your head in confusion. At least ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" can't be worse than this... right?",1331769600,2,2763,4.534136546184739
4984027,2,B006DVB3WO,"Grimm's Snow White is certainly not the fairytale you recall from your childhood. The story encompasses the standard characters - evil queen, huntsman, princess Snow White, prince Alexander, and many ""little"" people - and a few unexpected characters - dragon like creatures, over sized evil ""dogs"", and a magical green power source known as the viridian flame.

The viridian flame is located on Prince Alexander's land. The elves protect the viridian flame and utilize it's magical powers to hide from humans. The humans are amid of power struggle after the king's death and Prince Alexander offers to marry the evil queen to unite their two kingdoms. That is, until Snow White returns from the convent and the mirror reports that Snow White is the fairest in the land. The evil queen sends the huntsman on a mission to kill the princess and he fails when the dragon like creatures protect her. The elves discover Snow White laying unconscious in the woods. They reluctantly nurse her back to health unaware of her status in the kingdom. And just when you think the story is over because it's all you remember from the childhood version, it's not.

The story is predictable, probably because most of us at some point have heard the Snow White fairy tale. The CGI and make-up scream low budget and will leave you wondering why they choose to include CGI dragon like creatures at all. Overall the movie is a great introduction to darker films for younger kids but isn't a movie that you'll have to own - unless it's in the cheap movie bin at your local big box store.",1331683200,2,1565,4.728937728937729
4984028,2,B006DVB3WO,"I love the Snow White tale, but this was just ridiculous.  We started out with high hopes, but they were quickly dashed. The CG was HORRIBLY cheap, the makeup was almost as bad.  My husband and I ended up laughing our butts off by the end of the movie because we turned it into a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie, by adding our own lines, singing our own songs, etc.  AND honestly the plot is so thin and the acting so questionable, it really appears to be a bad x-rated movie without the dirty parts.
Not a good buy if you want to enjoy a movie about Snow White.  Totally a good buy if you like B-movies and you want to poke fun at it all night.  Enjoy!",1331337600,3,656,4.09375

Directed by: Rachel Lee Goldenberg.

This film has a look,  Achieved by filming in AUSTRIA with it's exotic forests and castle-like structives of old.

JANE MARCH (Clash Of The Titans,Color Of The Night and The Lover) is perfect as evil queen,Sorry to say but she is perfect in typecasting.

JAMIE THOMAS KING (Tinker,Tailor,Soldier,Spy and The Tudors) is again wonderful as the lovelorn prince and hero.

There are elves galore with each their own habits in LOTR type lore and pointed ears.

4984034,2,B006DVB3WO,The trailer was better than the film. Could have been better with a better script and more money for decent CGI. It had the equivalent of video game graphics. I feel sorry for the actors. They did the best they could with the lines they were given. I'd classify it as a B or high C movie based on script and graphics.,1350000000,,317,4.129032258064516

Never consider this movie. Oh and Asylum movies in general. The previews showed at least 4 movies there could have been more but they all blended into one. I couldn't tell them apart because they use the SAME CG SEQUENCES FOR DIFFERENT MOVIES. Talk about your shoestring budgets.

I feel bad for the actors in this.",1346630400,,638,4.308333333333334
4984036,4,B006DVB3WO,"Now I know that this movie was made and released to capitalize on all the 2012 Snow White hoopla.  I also knew that this was going to be very much in the vein of my favorite SyFy Movies.  While it is not going to be taking home any awards or making the critics top ten lists, IT IS A FUN MOVIE.  Someone mentioned that its an escape film, and that's what it is, an escape.  Yes, I will be the first to admit that I'm a purist when it comes to the presentation of my favorite fairy tale.  The fact that Snow White is a blonde was a little off-putting.  And something was up with the sound as I had to jack up the volume.  However, it was nice to see an ""alternate"" take on the story.  The elves were pretty cool and the romance between Snow White and Prince Alexander was sweet.  The guy just can't give up!!  To conclude folks, if you enjoy the delightful crap the SyFy Channel puts on every weekend, or you just want a break, then give this film a chance.  I'm glad I did!!",1344556800,,974,4.047120418848167
4984037,4,B006DVB3WO,"The opening of the DVD lets us know that Asylum has made over 100 films in 15 years and by the trailers, it looks like they are THE premier film maker of our age. It is worth a chuckle. This mock-buster film contains everything we have come to expect from Asylum's 15 year history. This one had second tier CG effects; actors who sound like they have been rejected from the Renaissance Fair; stolen script poorly rewritten; bad direction/editing, goofs, and plot continuity holes you can drive a truck through. And that is the good stuff.

We all know the story of Snow White (Eliza Bennett, Inkheart ). She comes to grieve her father fresh from the convent. (I didn't write this stuff.) The beginning opens with a narration of a ""falling star"" that lands on earth and creates a light/flame of great power. It also created two races: dragons and elves. The elves are skilled with the bow and have pointy ears (thank you JRR). There are 2 kingdoms, one protects the flame, the dragon and the elves, and the one ruled by Snow White's evil stepmother (Jane March, Clash of the Titans ). She wants to posses the flame, enslave the elves, and kill the dragons...and also be the fairest in the land too which has become almost secondary to the plot.

The elves are skilled with the bow, can disappear, and have magical powers over the earth yet fear for their lives at the hands of the Queen's bumbling huntsmen. The prince is played by Jamie Thomas King (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). There is no poison apple in this tale and fearful elves have replaced the singing dwarfs. The feral elves are more akin to Native American ninjas.

Runt (Sebastian Wimmer) is a likeable elf who provides the film with personality. Snow goes to the market the ""day before the new moon."" That night there is a full moon. The dungeon and battle scenes equally had me scratching my head. That is why I watch Asylum films...to relive the glory days of Ed Wood.

There are no subtitles on the DVD for the hearing impaired, although it might be better with the sound off. It did include a gag reel which is not worth watching.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. While the dragon kills people, there is no gore. One urination scene. A quick scene with a statue with one breast exposed. Unless you're John Ashcroft (remember him?) you most likely won't notice. 4 stars for plot continuity errors, mediocre acting, goofs, and  fake looking head roll. Unless you are a cult fan of Asylum films, my advice is don't go cheap. Spend the extra buck and enjoy the real blockbuster.",1338681600,11,2536,4.57488986784141
4984038,4,B006DVB3WO,"It seems like the old Grimm's fairy tales are becoming popular again thanks to the television series Once Upon A Time, and of course the lackluster comedy Mirror, Mirror and the dark Snow White and the Huntsman. Early this year The ASYLUM brought out their own titled Grimm's Snow White to DVD starring Eliza Bennett (Inkheart), Jamie Thomas King, and Jane March on a much lower budget.

  The plot follows the basic Snow White formula, but there are a number of differences. After Snow's father is eaten by a lizard-dragon, Prince Alexander arrives shortly after and offers to marry the now widowed Queen Gwendolyn. After rejecting his offer (for now), the Prince meets the beautiful Snow White and he instantly falls for her. Meanwhile, the Queen's mirror tells her that Snow is fairer than her, therefore she sends her huntsman to take Snow into the forest and murder her.

  Snow is rescued by elves. The huntsman is forced to kill an innocent man and brings his heart to the Queen, telling her it belongs to her stepdaughter. The Prince is heartbroken, while the Queen is thrilled as her plan to rule the kingdom is unfolding, which includes destroying the elves and taking their magic. The magical elves are the dwarfs in this tale, and they take the poor Snow into their home.

  The Queen finds out the huntsman lied, and she has an elf servant turn her into an old woman. In disguise, the Queen gives Snow not an apple, but a ring, which makes her sleep. Instead of the Princess awakening her with a kiss, he slips the Queen's ring off and replaces it with his own, awakening Snow.

  The Queen gathers her forces and plans on overthrowing the elves, but the elves have their own small army and Snow White with her bow and arrows.

  The ASYLUM Home Entertainment nicely sent me a complimentary DVD for this reviews, I was eager to watch Grimm's Snow White directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg from the screenplay by Naomi Selfman. Over the years Hollywood has lightened up the dark themed Grimm's fairy tales, so it is great to see new versions being released this year. As you can see from the DVD cover, Snow White is a blonde in this version. I know this may upset some people, but it didn't bother me all. In the very early versions, Grimm's referred to Snow as having ""yellow"" hair. Also, Disney considered having their Snow White as a blonde in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

  The acting for the most part is good, with Eliza Bennett (Snow) and Jane March (the Queen) standing out from the rest. The CGI special effects are low-budget, as the lizard-dragons are silly, and I'm glad they don't have that big of a part in the movie. The Queen's hounds look great when they are up close, but when they are running or attacking the effects are out of sync with the background. Replacing the dwarfs with elves was a nice touch, adding something new to the old Snow tale. One thing does bother me. Why didn't Snow ever mourn the death the death of her father? She never cried once, she was happy. I was disappointed that the huntsman only brought the Queen a heart, as in the original story he was suppose to bring the heart, liver, and the lungs as proof of Snow's death.

  I have seen a few other ASYLUM films and I have to say the production quality is better in this film. The film was shot in Austria and all the forest scenes look great. The movie contains a few scenes of violence, mostly involving the lizard/dragon, the hounds, and of the finale's battle scene, but there is nothing graphic, making this feels like more of a family fantasy. Overall, despite a few flaws, I enjoyed watching the Grimm's Snow White, and I recommend it to others.",1338336000,5,3664,4.554878048780488
4984039,1,B006DVB3WO,"I could list all the things wrong with this movie, but I'd be here all day. I would not recommend this movie at all.",1337904000,3,116,3.875
8496766,4,B006DVB3WO,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2012 and directed by Rachel Goldenberg, ""Grimms Snow White"" is a loose adaption of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about an evil queen (Jane March) who takes over her husbands kingdom after his dubious death. Upon discovering that her beautiful stepdaughter, Snow (Eliza Bennett), is a rival for the attentions of a valiant prince (Jamie Thomas King) she tries to kill her, but Snow escapes into the enchanted forest where she finds reluctant sanctuary with some elves (Sebastian Wimmer, Alan Burgon, Frauke Steiner, etc.). Meanwhile war is brewing. Otto Jankovich is on hand as the princes advisor.

The Asylum (film company) is known for making low-budget knockoffs of major films (always for less than $1 million) and thus Grimms Snow White came out eleven weeks before Snow White and the Huntsman to steal some of its thunder. While it lacks that films production polish, I found the story at least as engaging and Eliza Bennett is just all-around more fitting in the title role than the nigh impassive Kristen Stewart. Sure, she looks like Alice in Wonderland, but who cares? As for Snow's blonde hair, there have been renditions of the story where she has blonde (""golden"") hair. There's also at least one other film version where she's a blonde. Jamie Thomas King is also preferable to the hulking Chris Hemsworth simply because hes more of an every man and is just plain more likable.

Moreover, the locations and authentic castles are awesome, shot in the heart of Europe; and the emerald forests are to die for. Sure, the CGI dragons and canine beasts are hopelessly cartoony, but thats to be expected in a TV-budgeted flick.

If you don't mind low-budgets and like fantasy adventures that feature all the elements noted in my title blurb, youll find this movie entertaining. Remember: Imagination and legend are about good and evil and the power of selfless courage against impossible odds. There is nothing more heroic than man (male or female) against monster.  This is what you get in Grimms Snow White.

Yes, some Asylum movies suck (e.g. 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Mega Piranha), but some don't (e.g. The Land That Time Forgot and 6 Guns). Grimms Snow White ranks with the latter.

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in and around Vienna, Austria. WRITER: Naomi L. Selfman.
