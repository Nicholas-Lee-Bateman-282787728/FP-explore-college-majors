1689651,4,B0000639HP,"I am not a fan of the Air Bud series. I hated the first two. I didn't see the 3rd, and yet I enjoyed this one. But if you are expecting to see Josh, and Buddy ""Air Bud"" playing baseball, think again. This time Buddy and Josh's kid sister are playing baseball. The first Air Bud, had Buddy playing basketball, the 2nd Air Bud was him playing football, the 3rd one is with Buddy playing soccer. What's next? Buddy playing hockey. And Buddy also playing tennis and volleyball. As the movie begins, two bad guys are planning to steal Buddy and Buddy's puppies for some progect. The two bad guys has a pet raccon. While Josh (Kevin Zegers) is getting ready to leave college, he offers his room to his kid sister, but she turns the offer down. Her name is Andrea (My Dog Skip's Caitlin Wachts). She and her friend Tammy (Chantal Strand) tries to go out for a lot of actives, until Tammy sugguests baseball, the both try out, Tammy is good at baseball, while Andrea stinks at baseball. But Tammy talks the coach into having Andrea on the baseball team. I would reccomend this film to you if either love the ""Air Bud"" series or love baseball.",1045699200,3,1134,4.404761904761905

1689662,4,B0000639HP,"Air Bud is back---this time he has a baseball bat in his teeth! Another sequal to the Air Bud series. Let me get my point across. Obviousely this movie shows a lot of unrealism. ""A dog holding a baseball bat in his teeth and hitting the ball!? Then, him catching a baseball with his teeth!? Come on, give me a break!!!"" Sure this is all a little far fetched--but sometimes thats just how some movies are. All the Air Buds are far fetched-but that doesn't necessarily make them bad movies! I love watching Air Bud. I've seen most of them. This (just like the others) is a good family film to watch. Besides-it's a Golden retriever playing sports-ya gotta love it!!!",1213747200,,664,4.4958677685950414

1689664,4,B0000639HP,"Sure there are a million air bud movies, but this is nice family entertainment.  Simple, direct story that young children can follow

and root for the air bud family.  Emphasis on point of view of children

and a family that can say ""I love you"" to each other.  Minimizes ""evil

bad guy"" angle so as not to be a distraction as in so many other movies.

Good for 1rst and 2nd graders.",1159747200,,383,4.236111111111111
1689665,3,B0000639HP,This movie is okay but I'm not too interested in it. The first and second Air bud movies were the best to me. This movie couldn't make me laugh so I sticked to the first two Air bud movies.,1140480000,4,189,3.871794871794872
1689666,1,B0000639HP,"Any movie that only manages to get 12 people to scribble down a few thoughts is one that you are probably better leaving on the store's shelf.  Those who did manage to write a review are eager to tell you that AIR BUD - SEVENTH INNING FETCH is one of the best of the ""Air Bud"" sequels.  Well...let me tell you, folks: that's not saying much.  This movie is pure trash.  It was probably filmed in three days and merely churned out in order to get kids to drag their parents to one more ""Air Bud"" movie.

Let's hope that Bud is on his way out. After all, there aren't a lot of sports left to play.  But somehow I get the eery feeling that I'm going to be taking my kids to the 50th sequel: AIR BUD - CANINE CURLING or, better yet, AIR BUD - BOBSLED BARK.  Come on , folks.  Do us a favor and let's put this franchise to sleep.",1130025600,6,824,3.981707317073171

1689668,4,B0000639HP,"It can be hard to generate sequels to a movie that was based on a true story.  The original movie starred Air Bud, a real golden retriever with 20,000 career baskets.  Unfortunately the read Buddy lost a leg shortly after the film was made.
In this sequel, the storyline returns to some real issues and not just silliness.  Josh's oldest sister (his only full sibling) must deal with Josh going away to college.  Josh promises to return, but it is hard for her, especially when his old room begins being remade for the new baby.  Andrea's old life from her parents seems to be being swept away by the new life with step-father and half sibling.
But Andrea has other problems.  She has just entered junior high with her best friend and they try to fit in by joining an activity.  Unfortunately they are hopeless at most everything until they try baseball.  Andrea's friend Tammy has real talent but Andrea just doesn't know what to do.  Tammy only agrees to be on the team if Andrea is on it as well.  This means that Andrea does a lot of bench warming.
But when Tammy is injured Andrea if forced into play and helps the team lose game after game.  She then finds out that the coach didn't want her on the team originally.
Buddy to the rescue!  Buddy helps Andrea by getting her to practice.  Andrea funnels her anger into intensive practice and refuses to give up.  Eventually she begins to catch and hit.  More and more practice and she becomes a decent player.
Of course this wouldn't be an Air Bud movie if Buddy didn't suit up and play.  Seeing Buddy holding a bat is one of the most unbelievable things in the movie.  Sorry, just couldn't handle that one (although I can believe his catching ability).
The other major downer in the movie is the way Andrea's parents behave.  I can accept them being less attentive due to the new baby buy they seem so unconcerned when Andrea goes missing (although not as bas as when Josh goes missing in the previous movie).
Tension is added to the film by a Horace and Jasper type team who are out to abduct Buddy and his kids (there are only four instead of six like in the previous movie) in an attempt to discover the sports gene and its secrets.  Their bumbling efforts are offset by an even more bumbling sheriff in the silliest cowboy hat seen in a long time.
I have to say that I rank the original Air Bud as the best of the films, followed by Seventh Inning Stretch and then World Pup.  I don't think the rest are worth ranking.",1075939200,9,2476,4.4

7959079,2,B0000639HP,"Air Bud; Seventh Inning Fetch is a pointless, preposterous and prosaic sequel in the Air Bud series of sports-themed movies. The animals are beautiful and the baseball uniforms look sharp, but theres not much else to recommend this film. The dialogue is weak, the plot is telegraphed, the characters are flat, and the situations are absurd. The high point was when a baby urinated on the tween protagonist.",1449100800,2,406,4.985294117647059
