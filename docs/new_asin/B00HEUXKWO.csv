6160664,5,B00HEUXKWO,This will be a little graduation present to myself. ;) I cannot wait until it comes out! This is by far my most favorite season!,1392768000,,128,4.16
6160665,4,B00HEUXKWO,What saga is going to be on volume 1 and how many episodes will be on this volume along with what saga or sagas?,1390780800,2,112,3.7083333333333335
6160666,5,B00HEUXKWO,I loved this show since it first premiered on kids Wb and I sometimes missed episodes but now I can own them all and catch up on the ones I missed and re-watch ones I loved the most. After the show is finished being released I Hope GX gets a box set release and New Video can get a company to dub the remaining episodes so we can have the whole series in english and on dvd.,1388707200,4,374,3.8701298701298703
6160667,4,B00HEUXKWO,"I believe the final case cover should have Red Eyes Black Dragon on it since seasons one- four have Blue Eyes White Dragon, Dark Magician, Dark Pladin, and Dark Magician Girl respectively.",1388620800,,188,4.90625
6160668,4,B00HEUXKWO,"I expect this set to be like the others. A cardboard slipcase, 2 DVD cases with 3-4 DVDs each. With some cool designs on the covers of each. It's the 4Kids dub, but what can you do. Hopefully once they get this out, they'll start releasing GX & 5Ds, with finished dubs for the episodes 4Kids didn't do. I'll update this review once I get the set.",1388361600,6,346,4.17910447761194
6160669,4,B00HEUXKWO,"Maybe after this final Season, they will start the same thing with Yu-gi-oh! GX and hopefully create DVDS not just for the first Season, but also Season 2, 3, and maybe have Season 4 in English Audio as well.",1387411200,5,208,4.358974358974359

6160674,2,B00HEUXKWO,"Ryu bakura isn't in this season like at all
O-O except randomly near the end mystically appearing the the ship everyone is on happily eating a bunch of food while everyone else is nostalgic and meloncholy lol!! Yami bakura is here but no offense to the Yami bakura fan girls but he's creepy!!!! Ryu bakura the real one the sweet one is not really on here so that's why I gave it 2 stars but for people who just like the show it would be 5 stars !. Me personally get bored without someone or something to fan girl about so there fore I only watch the seasons with ryu bakura in it and I'm more of a school rumble , fruba, hakuoki, sailor moon, Pokemon ,lucky star fan girl . I really enjoy the yugioh card game tho xD!!!! Lol",1454630400,,724,4.141843971631205

6160690,5,B00HEUXKWO,"I'm really thankful Amazon gave me a discount like 45% off its original price, had to re order this season plus three other movies, just cuz they were sold w/o my knowledge. So, next chance I got, I re bought them. I'm very pleased w my items. Amazon never disappoints, they're service is always satifactory ^_^",1405468800,,311,4.571428571428571
6160691,5,B00HEUXKWO,"I'm so glad that they rereleased this series on dvd. Now I have the complete series for myself. Now I just have to wait and see if they do the same for yu gi oh gx.

6160692,5,B00HEUXKWO,"With Season 5, the story is now complete and so is the collection of this amazing serie and wonderful DVD-boxes!",1402876800,,112,4.65
6160693,5,B00HEUXKWO,I have FINALLY completed collecting all 5 seasons of Yu-Gi-Oh! Which has been something I've wanted to do since I was little. Forgot how much I truly loved this anime until I watched it all the way through.,1401667200,,206,4.447368421052632
6160694,5,B00HEUXKWO,I bought this season because it is the last season of the Series Yu-Gi-Oh! I also have the previous 4 seasons & I wanted to complete my collection. It was also nice to watch the final duel especially between Yugi & Atem (The Pharaoh) again. That was a terrific duel.,1400716800,,266,4.34
6160695,5,B00HEUXKWO,"This is it, the final season of Yugioh. In this season, we experience Atem's past about the hellish war between Atem and the darkness in ancient Egypt, and the devastating power of the Egyptian Gods. This season takes place after Atem, Kaiba, and Joey defeated Dartz and Kaiba sets up a tournament in the first half and in the last half is Atem's past also the most sad and memorial moment of all Yugioh fandom: the final duel between Atem and Yugi. The final duel will determine Atem's fate if he can stay with Yugi or vanish with his friends forever. I hope New Video Group will release GX, and 5D's in the future.",1399075200,,616,4.412280701754386
6160696,4,B00HEUXKWO,"I'm glad to finally complete my entire yugioh collection. I'm more excited that the GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP & DAWN OF THE DUEL will finally be together as one. What I'm NOT excited about is this price. $50???...really???...I shop on amazon at least once a week & usually they have the better price, but not this time. I found this elsewhere for HALF the price. amazon dropped the ball on this one.",1398297600,4,392,4.614285714285714
6160697,5,B00HEUXKWO,"Let's hope that Cinedigm (who now own New Video Group) don;t stop here, but go on to release GX, 5DS and Zexal. Espescially if they can dub the missing episodes.

The Cinedigm release that announced the partnership with 4Kids stated that the deal covered ""600 episodes"" which is, of course, far more than the original series and than we have seen on DVD thusfar, so it is quite likely it seems that the sequel series are destined for release also.

The release rate is quite fast too, thankfuly nothing like the other studios like Fox who have in th epast taken years between half-seasons and who even now release the Simpons slower than it;s being made/broadcast!",1397606400,3,664,4.7155172413793105
6160698,3,B00HEUXKWO,"I would love this to be released in the UK badly cause i don't want to buy in volumes :(

I hope GX gets a re released and the final episode of season 3 and season 4 gets dubbed for DVD release cause those episodes need to see the light of day.

5ds is another thing they skipped alot of episodes and they stopped right after Grand Prix Series despite being another series after that. that also needs to be dubbed as well",1397520000,,421,4.0602409638554215

Everything is really good except but only one thing, there is around 4 cms length scratch mark at the volume 2 box, but others are 100% intact. The resolution of the DVDs are really good. I definitely buy the other remaing seasons.",1495152000,,393,4.472222222222222
