7789294,5,0773386866,"At the time of writing this is the most recent season of Kavanagh Q.C. available to American viewers with no prospect of any later seasons due to be released.
Given the paucity of new storylines which tend to appear in television shows generally, these three programmes are very refreshing in their scope and content.
Volume 1 is the story of a murder with only one suspect, the daughter of a British diplomat who is playing a crucial role in European relations. The case is complicated by the insistence of the accused that she is innocent, the implication that there is an incestuous relationship between the father and daughter and the critical involvement of the security services in helping toi achieve British foreign policy objectives by fair means or foul. The full panoply of political power is brought to bear to influence Kavangh in the prosecution of his case.
Volume two concerns a private prosecution for murder by a man who's only son was killed by the stepson of a local gangster. The criminal prosecution failed when a key witness was nobbled by persons unknown and then refused to testify. As the investigation proceeds the same forces are again at work and almost succeed but in the process a damaging secret is revealed which has considerable impact on the case.
In the final volume, Kavanagh ventures to Florida to lend a hand to former pupil Julia who is attempting to free a prisoner on death row whilst in the latter stages of pregnancy. During the course of his stay circumstances force him to plead the case when the baby is born prematurely and in doing so Kavanagh discovers vital information which has implications extending far beyond the prison cell.
All in all the season has some great moments. As far as his family life is concerned the shows reveal the gradual departure of his son from the family home and allows for a more intimate examination of his relationship with his wife. In chambers, Peter's past relationship re-emerges and Jeremy's frantic efforts to climb the social ladder provide great amusement. The grim reality of the American penal system is put into sharp focus in the last story although in my view this portrayal leaves a lot to be desired given the size of the prison population in Britain and the conditions in which considerable numbers of those prisoners live.
All in all another outstanding collection of excellent courtroom dramas.",1016582400,5,2394,4.870098039215686
