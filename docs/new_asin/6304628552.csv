8184894,4,6304628552,"Everybody's favorite silver-haired, black-suited cowboy almost meets his match when a pretty schoolmarm comes to town to educate the local rowdies.  If this sounds too syrupy, don't worry.  Dastardly rustlers are actively stealing from the Bar 20 herd.  There are blazing six-guns aplenty when Hoppy rounds up the boys and confronts the bad guys in the climactic shootout.  William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy is a memorable figure of  Western movie folklore.  Hoppy's adventures at the Bar 20 ranch were a hit with Saturday matinee movie audiences in the '30s and '40s. They were also a fixture of Saturday morning TV in the baby-boomer '50s.  Our favorite comic relief sidekick, Gabby Hayes, is the lovable Windy Halliday.  There is an unusual amount of singing in this entry.  Typically, the Hopalong Cassidy series avoided the Gene Autry/Roy Rogers type of Western musical, and stressed outdoor action.  Perhaps the studio was tipping its hat to its singing cowboy rivals because a boys choir sings several folk songs.  With the flag flying at the rough-hewn schoolhouse, the graduation ceremony segment captures some of the spirit of the American frontier.  This entertaining B Western blends action and light humor.  There is also an unusual dollop of sentiment regarding the importance of education in settling the West.  Saddle up and enjoy the ride.

I am in perfect  agreement with Mr. Boyd. But after you get passed the singing, this movie  is a rollicking adventure even if the rustler plot has been done to death.  There is a slight twist to the proceedings that surprised me.
However, it  isn't the fate of the Bar 20 cattle that holds your attention here. It's  the fun that the three heroes (Hoppy, Windy, and Lucky) have competing for  the affections of the new schoolmarm that steal the show. Don't pass up the  chance to see Hoppy in an apron and Windy slicked up to go a courtin'.",956534400,3,744,4.3478260869565215
