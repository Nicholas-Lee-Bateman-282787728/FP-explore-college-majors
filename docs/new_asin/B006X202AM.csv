I love these movies. I've got all they ever made. John Nettles is sensational. I'm always looking forward to the next set at the time I'm watching the current set. If I could give more than 5 STARS I would. To me they rate a ""10"". Please keep them coming.",1334361600,6,420,6.368421052631579
5030163,5,B006X202AM,"Good news: the excellent actor Neil Dudgeon, featured in earlier episodes of Midsomer, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mrs-Bradley-Mysteries/dp/B0002XVRXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries</a>, among many other roles, will lead as John Barnaby, a relative of irascible, inimitable Tom Barnaby/John Nettles. He doesn't enter until the last episode, when his visit to Tom's home is interrupted by yet another murder in that particularly dangerous corner of Midsomer, Badger's Drift, when a vicar is found hanging by a bell-rope. And now we all anticipate ""Set 21,"" the wait will be worth it. As always, the intrepid Jason Hughes is a wonderful foil as Detective Sergeant Ben Jones, his wry humor adds another level of complexity to the series. The U.K. boasts so many fine, often underrated actors. Jane Wymark as Joyce Barnaby is perfection (catch this gifted actress in an early, tragic role in the second series of Poldark), as is Laura Howard as their understanding daughter.

Midsomer County is oddly rife with uncanny mysteries, so it's good that John Barnaby is gifted with the same powers of keen observation and memory as his cousin Tom. A ""similar-looking"" man was a gifted gardener in an early Midsomer mystery; DCI John Barnaby is likely as good with plants as his look-alike. This is a Midsomer family after all, they often feature peculiar, recurring family resemblances (recall the duo in first Midsomer Mystery, ""The Killings of Badger's Drift""). Sharp dialogue makes this collection a real treat. Don't assume this is lace doily stuff, no indeed! We even love the weird and unique music. Note the badger emblem on the police cars. The Brits have knack for mixing classic stories with ghoulish humor and sharp observations of the flawed human character. Historically, penny-dreadfuls were published at Christmastime, as in Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens.

This series is a virtual escape to the beautiful but dangerous environs of Midsomer county. We're happy to fall through the cracks of normal reality, into Midsomer, whose denizens inflict and suffer numerous creative malaises. The cleverness of this series is addictive.

Master Class: Lydia Wilson is superb as Zoe Stock, a gifted pianist, haunted by strange visions. Competition is deadly for positions in Sir Michael Fielding's master class. Long buried secrets are unearthed, several denizens seem to have issues with bright lights, and the dead contact the living. The theme of eugenics is shown in all it's ugliness.

The Noble Art: Who knew that with boxing and gambling, we'd get a chance to see Jackie Tyler again, Rose's mom from Doctor Who?! Camille Coduri does a luscious turn, with one of the best Midsomer lines ever, to an odious prig: ""Is that a smile, or your lips just sliding off your teeth?""

Not in My Backyard: Oh, those dratted contemporary designs besmirching our villages. Some of the best, most improbable innovative Midsomer murders take place here, via sliding doors and cement. But what do you expect when Jekyll/Tom Jackman's mama makes a guest appearance.

Fit for Murder: Poor Joyce, she just wants to take her Tom to a retreat, to calm him down. But murder and mayhem ensue, because when Joyce arrives on the scene, Midsomer's citizens meet untimely, gruesome ends. Tom Barnaby finds himself confronting his birthday and visions of his difficult father. Appearances by Cully and DCI John Barnaby enrich this delightful episode. Surprise: guest-star appearance of excellent actor Shaun Dingwall, who perfectly played Pete Tyler, errant husband of Jackie (above, in ""The Noble Art""), father of Doctor Who's Rose. Perhaps a few Midsomer occurrences can be attributed to an occasional alignment with Doctor Who: the alien crop-circles, weird murders and unearthly body-count.",1330905600,70,3857,5.388059701492537
5030164,5,B006X202AM,"My husband and I have all the sets of Midsomer Murder, and are looking forward to set 19 coming out on 2/28.  We are in the process of re-watching all of them now.  Although I love John Nettles as Barnaby, I'm interested to see if his replacement brings a new pizzaz to the series.  I hope that Jones will still be around to lend a hand!

We love murder mysteries, and the British mysteries are the best!  We have all the Morse, Lewis, Frost, Poirot, Dalgliesh, Lynley, Holmes, and Foyle's War series, as well as a few other miscellaneous sets (Lark Rise to Candleford is a favorite!!), and we treasure them all.

Thanks to Amazon for bringing us good entertainment!  You're my favorite website!",1330300800,78,695,4.556451612903226
5030165,5,B006X202AM,"Series 20's 4 episodes continue the perfection in crime drama perfected by CI Barnaby (John Nettles.) He' crime tough, humorous, softly romantic, but makes every episode always suspenseful murders in the plural. Never one murder mystery in Midsomer County, a quaint picturesquely filmed area of village sets.
If you are new to Midsomer Murders and CI Barnaby there are years of award winning episodes to view. My favorite is ALWAYS the one I just viewed.

Wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), daughter Cully (Laura Howard) & DC Stephens (Kirsty Dillon) all make this set their exit from this long-running British TV show, as does Nettles. Cast regulars DS Jones (Jason Hughes) and Dr. Bullard (Barry Jackson) will remain for future episodes with DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) leading those investigations. John Barnaby is involved in this set's last episode. A smashing series but there will be those upset and downplaying the future once Nettles is gone. He does leave large shoes to fill, as does the departing cast that exits behind him. But that's set 21, not 20, so why worry now, and the shows will yet be based on Caroline Graham novels, and the writing has been a huge factor in the longevity which started in 1997.

SUBTITLES available in all 4 longer-than-feature-length episodes
Guest stars (too numerous to mention them all) are as characteristic of Midsomer Murders as the multiple murders and multiple plots mixing humor, crime, and relationships, and beautiful scenes. I've heard on bonus materials in the past that stars beg to kill or be murdered in Midsomer.

Episodes:
~~~~MASTER CLASS -a Barnaby dj vu mystery suicide-drowning and baby abandonment with a musical twist.
~~~~THE NOBLE ART -does the title refer to boxing or all of the local adulterous activity, gender mix, in the small community? Whatever, it results in numerous murders.
~~~~NOT IN MY BACK YARD -new development plans have supporters, participants, opposition, everything but apathy, and that's a recipe for community strife not to mention murder.
~~~~FIT FOR MURDER -a death in a health and fitness spa may be murder, Barnaby at the scene, and the episode will best be known as the final episode with John Nettles.

6 2/3 HOURS of time-tested British Mystery Drama entertainment acclaimed around the world. Multiple murders but usually not violently shown nor graphically filmed. The emphasis is on the plots, not shocking blood and violence. About as family friendly as you can get with murder.",1329609600,167,2475,5.088669950738916

If you're a fan of British TV and particularly crime dramas, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this collection. Sadly, these later seasons are not so difficult to figure out as the earlier seasons won, but they're still enjoyable. The great part about this set is when cousins DCI's John and Tom Barnaby work together on a case.
The sad part of this set of episodes is the farewell to DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and his wife Joyce. I've tried watching a few of the new episodes, several actually to give the new characters a fair chance, but I can't get into them. The humor and camaraderie that existed up to now is gone from set 21 forward. When Set 20 ended, in my opinion so did the show, but BBC keeps it going.",1412035200,6,892,4.379518072289157

The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!

There are always interesting guest stars, the scenery is gorgeous and the stories are well written and acted.  John Nettles is the heart and soul of the series and will be greatly missed.
His interaction with all the regular characters made the show more than just another cop/detective thing that we have seen over and over.
He had  healthy happy relationships with his family and his 3 overworked assistants which made a pleasant change from all the dysfunctional
policemen that are so prevalent in other series.  The murders were generally off camera which was greatly appreciated since we can see enough gunfire, stabbings, explosions, etc in other fare of that genre.  Barnaby was not another rogue cop fighting the establishment and his superiors which, also, was a welcome relief.  He was a decent guy trying to do the right thing intelligently and with humor and allowing us to ride along with first Troy, then Scott and finally Ben into solving the crimes of the Midsomer counties.  The final episodes with John Nettles were worthy of him and a fitting goodbye to our favorite detective.  I hope he comes back for some cameos.",1407628800,2,1231,4.856459330143541

5030297,4,B006X202AM,"The danger with long-running series like MIDSOMER MURDERS is complacency on the part of the producers. Scripts become less imaginative, production values suffer, actors get bored and start phoning in performances. Aided by the steady hand of producer Brian True-May, MIDSOMER has maintained a standard of excellence throughout its long run that puts many other, newer series to shame. While the show (and its producer) has its criticsand any show that is on for well over a decade is bound to run the risk of repetitionMIDSOMER MURDERS, in my opinion, is just as engaging as it was at the beginning.

The production values of these four episodes, the uniformly outstanding acting, the plot twists and the obvious care that goes into each mystery, pays dividends in terms of solid entertainment value. It also speaks highly for True-May, who could easily coast along with this successful formula and its loyal audience, but to his credit, he is clearly dedicated to maintaining the integrity of the series.

Admittedly, the scenery, the quaintness of village life, the architecture, the customs, the characters  all of these attributes are fundamental to its charm and success. But the real fun lies in the complexity of the stories. Lets review exactly what the series formula is, for those of you who are reading about MIDSOMER MURDERS for the first time.

Midsomer County in England is dotted with sunny (obviously a nod to the fantasy aspect of the show), cozy, idyllic, picturesque villages. But what lurks in the shadows? Apparently, a very high percentage of the population harbor murder, mayhem and various sexual perversions in their black little hearts. The show is basically an extended metaphor for the darkness that lies within every member of civilized society. Fortunately for the sake of society, most of us manage to keep our villainous fantasies in check. Fortunately for the sake of entertainment, a lot of people in Midsomer have lost their inhibitions and their neighbours are dropping like flies. Death comes dressed in the most colourful fashions in MIDSOMER MURDERS. Where else can one find a body bludgeoned into oblivion by vintage wine bottles launched from a catapult? Or a rock star electrocuted on stage by a viciously mis-wired microphone? Macabre humour and dark irony are a staple of every MIDSOMER fans diet.

The series remains engaging, top-notch entertainment. The mystery is always solvable, but loaded with twists and turns to keep you guessing. It never fails to be fun and interesting, and never indulges itself by intentionally frustrating the viewer with unsolvable plots. This is quality entertainment, not gritty realism (which is just a euphemism for unnecessarily graphic violence and sickening language). Thank heavens MIDSOMER MURDERS is not afraid to buck that ugly trend and continue to offer up this truly lovable crime series.

MIDSOMER MURDERS is inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham, modern master of the English village mystery. Scripts are based on her main characters, most notably Tom Barnaby, a likable, hardworking family man and astute detective. John Nettles intelligent eyes sparkle with an obvious sense of humour in this character. His overall demeanor is one of reliability and kindness. The fact is, series star John Nettles is exceptional. His characterization avoids monotony because he as an actor is just so darn interesting. In some ways, watching Nettles as Tom Barnaby is like putting on a John Wayne movie. You know you're going to get a variation on a themebut what a theme! Barnaby is an exceptional character in terms of television crime fighters in that he is a normal family man with a loving wife and daughter. He is also a believable age for a senior detective. The drama is in the mystery, not in the man.

This is perhaps going to be the saving grace for MIDSOMER MURDERS, as the episode Fit for Murder marks John Nettles departure from the wild and wooly world of policing in Midsomer. Its a nervous time for hardcore fans. Tom Barnaby is an old friend by now and will be missed. His replacement, Toms cousin DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon), was introduced in The Sword of Guillaume, an episode released in SET 19. Jason Hughes will carry on with the series as DS Ben Jones. Fingers crossed that the twisted story lines, excellent dialogue and inspired performances will continue unabated in SET 21. As always, we excitedly await the next murderous plot to crawl out of the dark corners in the lovely villages of Midsomer.",1397433600,,4512,5.032128514056225

But there are way too many gruesome murders per episode for me.  I am  VERY SAD to see TOM BARNABY/John Nettles retire.  He & George Bullard/Barry Jackson are the main attractions.  But his leave taking was beautifully done.  That Jackson leaves, as well is a double blow!  Also love & will miss Joyce /Jane Wymark & Cully/Laura Howard.......But we need to give JOHN BARNABY/Neil Dudgeon a chance--at least he's Tom's cousin!
At least the series will continue....with JASON HUGHES/Ben Jones, I earnestly hope.
Thankfully, all the episodes of series 20 were excellent:  thoroughly engaging, suspenseful, & ironic to the max.

Just an aside:  I am also a fan of Law & Order and I must say, MIDSOMMER MURDERS is NOTHING like L & O--why people find such trite & inaccurate inferences necessary, I cannot imagine!",1383523200,,917,4.902597402597403

The premise of the book is centered around a group of teens at an arts camp that focuses on plays, writing and music.

The only disappointed was the way they ended C I Barnaby's career.  They should have expanded on it better for a more satisfactory ending rather than just having him abruptly retire at the end.

5030426,5,B006X202AM,"Series twenty (20) of the very fine British Murder Mystery Series ""Midsomer Murders""  certainly carries on the fine tradition of the previous seasons.  That tradition for twenty (20) seasons has consisted of splendid writings, eccentric characters, great acting and wonderful direction.

Series/season twenty (20) has four (4) ninety (90) minute episodes that are filled with beautiful gardens on the surface while lurking ""below"" are ""murders most foul"" that leads to good detective work by Barnaby (wonderfully acted in a very courteous manner but with much humor by John Needles--I've adored him for all of the twenty seasons) and his partner DS Jones (marvelously acted with some astonishment at Barnaby's intuition in solving cases and with loads of humor by Jason Hughes).  Season twenty (20) was very much, per usual in this ""Midsomer"" series,  enjoyed by me; however, my enjoyment was ""tinged"" with sadness because this marks John Needles' departure along with the characters of his wife and daughter--I've come to adore them too.

If you desire to view some good well written mysteries that are about super talented pianists with ""selective breeding"" as a major goal in life, horrific deaths by cement and horse tranqulizers, boxers whose goals include ""bedding"" any woman available, sexual secrets and unfulfilled love that lead to murder(s), etc., feel free to buy Series twenty (20) of ""Midsomer Murders"" it is filled with so much debauchery that makes for splendid entertainment.

(The episode, in Season twenty-20-that covers the character of Barnaby's retirement was very ""bittersweet"" for me.  I was very sad to be losing John Needles as DCI Barnaby because I've loved him doing the role for so very long.  At the same time the episode was filled with what I have loved about the series of ""Midsomer Murders"" -good mysteries filled with humor and loads of eccentric characters and with Barnaby and his wife Joyce ""bouncing"" off each other in splendid ways--great and very natural acting by the two actors)",1356393600,,2021,5.193846153846154

5030461,4,B006X202AM,"midsomer murders has a hit formula that has lasted for 15 years. In 2010 , the lead actor finally decided to call it quits and these are the last four episodes with him. In spite of that the last two seasons have done quite well. That doesn't mean that we the devoted viewers of this show won't miss Inspector Barnaby. This set features four more stories of murder. Each one follows the formula of three murders a show. And the writers always seem to come up with new ideas to frame the murders around. This time there's the disturbing musical murder case, master class. Then one about boxing and gambling , then one that has been covered before , a case about people building on land  a village wants to keep pristine, and the last one taking place in a spa. These episodes deliver good stories and well oiled acting from the lead actors, after all this show has it all down pat. But it's never boring! It's just a fun romp in the beautiful countryside of Southern England. After all we all know this isn't based on reality , it's based on novels and through it all we keep watching. At this stage , some people will start to grow tired of the shows formula, but not MOST of the shows fans. That's why there's hardly any bad reviews. The dvd's have a few extra features on one of them, and the picture is sharp as this was shot on high grade film. In the  uk I believe this set is on blu ray.

The ending was perfect and it was good to see all the characters we have cared about through the years gathered in one place.  The only one really missing was Troy, but I guess that would've been too much to ask.  Other than that I thought he went out on a good note and made the transition easy for the actor who is taking on a new role, but still the Barnaby name.  I won't spoil the exact ending for anyone who hasn't seen it, but trust me to say that you won't be disappointed.

5030482,5,B006X202AM,"I know, I know....the series will continue with a new inspector, but it won't be Tom Barnaby as personified by John Nettles. The series has been wonderful, full of wacky characters, improbable murders, witty dialogue,  beautiful scenery, and above all, the grace and attractiveness of the long time stars and stalwart supporters.  It will be sorely missed. Thankfully, I have all twenty sets and can view any one at any time I feel like revisiting Tom, Joyce, Jones, George, and the others who made this such a wonderful experience over the past years.  My only quibble with the very last program, Barnaby's goodbye, is that there was no real goodbye party written into the script.  The goodbye scene was very quiet and subdued, as if Barnaby (and plucky Joyce) were riding off into the sunset.  Viewers who love British mysteries of a slightly tongue in cheek nature should invest in purchasing all volumes. You'll be investing in hours of pleasurable and repeatable viewing.",1347148800,,976,4.96319018404908

5030518,5,B006X202AM,"I have been very confused by the listing of this dvd but finally read a review of it in the New York Times which answered my questions.  When this is referred to as the ""season of the show"", as it would be when it airs on tv, this IS SEASON 13.  However, if you have been buying sets of the shows in America, it is referred to as SET 20.

The picture on the box is also confusing. The figure on the left is John Nettles who has starred in all 13 seasons. He stopped at the end of the season 13 and the actor on the right took over the Barnaby role as his cousin. This actor is shown in this season but it is Ben who remains Barnaby's partner and who should really be shown on the box.  The actor on the right has played the lead in the rest of the series which has already aired in the UK as season 14 and two episodes of season 15.  These numbers have nothing to do with the sets of dvds numbering as they are being released in the USA.

You may find this useful as it can be very confusing if you are following this show in more than one viewing resource.

This concluding season for John Nettles is every bit as good as the prior seasons.  The high camp humor continues throughout. The concluding one is rather poignant as we learn then that John Nettles is retiring as Chief Inspector Barnaby. The show as a whole has cast a satiric gaze on the UK murder mystery which features the grisliest murders in the most bucolic and idyllic village settings. Throughout their polite, purpose filled days in leading proper lives, these people are capable of quite compelling bits of violence and the detectives find them out with their own inventive and amusing ways.
