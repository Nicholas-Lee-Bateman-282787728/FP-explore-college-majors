2059631,4,B00023P4HY,"""The Dreamers,"" directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, is set in Paris in the 60s.  Michael Pitt plays Matthew, an American student and cinema lover.  He meets Isabelle and Theo (played by Eva Green and Louis Garrel), a brother and sister with a rather unusual relationship.  The film follows the trio as they explore their passion for film and for each other in the shadow of political upheaval.
""Dreamers"" is a beautiful film to watch.  It's full of sensuous, artfully crafted images--many involving explicit nudity.  Michael Pitt is impressive in the lead role.  He brings a wide-eyed sense of wonder and an appealing vulnerability to his character.  He also fully commits to the frank sexuality of the performance.
Despite the efforts of Green and Garrel, however, I never found their characters believable, and this weakens the film overall--as does its abrupt and unsatisfying ending.  Still, the film as a whole pulsates with life and energy, and contains some really wonderful scenes. ""The Dreamers"" is a vivid portrait of a society in upheaval, and a celebration of the power of film.",1078963200,,1087,5.067415730337078
2059632,3,B00023P4HY,"There are two types of dreamers in ""The Dreamers"":  the three main characters, who create their own interior world and prefer to view the outside world by watching classic 1930s cinema; and the socialist street revolutionaries of riot-torn 1968 Paris, who attempt to overthrow the political and economic power structure.  ""The Dreamers"" focuses more on the former than the latter, and Bernardo Bertolucci is careful to leave his film open to interpretation, but ultimately the dream world of the three main characters is shattered by the realities of life.  The film ends before resolving the outcome of the second set of dreamers, but we all know our history.  Some may think it a shame that the dreamers fail, but others like myself will view it as something that has to happen, if the dream is unrealistic and unsustainable.
The relationship between the three main characters is unlike anything that I've ever seen portrayed on film.  The twins, Isabelle and Theo, are almost as close to each other in young adulthood as they were during the nine months they spent together in their mother's womb.  Matthew, a U.S. student studying abroad in Paris, inserts himself into the middle, and when he receives early indications that portend the depth of the relationship between the twins, he does not run away.  To me, this required too much suspension of disbelief, but I'm certainly aware that others have different proclivities.  If Bertolucci's intent was to show a high degree of separation between his three dreamers and the rest of society, he certainly succeeded.
The three dreamers have some, but ultimately too little, awareness of their separation from reality and the unsustainable nature of the world they create.  While sympathizing with the revolutionaries in the street, they actually are the ultimate materialistic consumers:  they produce nothing that they consume (neither food nor art), and when the money their parents provide runs out, and they've drained most of the wine cellar, the harsh realities of life set in.  Rooting through trash heaps isn't the answer, and the choices that they leave themselves in the end (self-annihilation or nihilism), I believe, show just how flawed their ideal world is.  My interpretation is that this lesson also applies to the other set of dreamers, the street revolutionaries, but those who even today sympathize with the views of those revolutionaries will reject this interpretation.
""The Dreamers"" is very voyeuristic, and Bertolucci puts his three leads through some incredibly intimate moments.  All three leads are quite good, with Eva Green in particular deserving special notice for a completely uninhibited performance (at least the two male leads had each other's example to follow).  It's hard to come up with an accurate overall rating for this film, because I think there will be a widespread variance in how different people react to both the storyline and the images.  Read the reviews carefully, and if it sounds like something that interests and won't shock you, then give it a try.  My middle-of-the-road rating is mainly due to my not being terribly interested in the type of relationship formed by the three main characters.",1078876800,254,3201,5.126923076923077
2059633,2,B00023P4HY,"What exactly was the point of this film?  Close up shots of body parts? Plot was lacking. Acting is stiff. Burtolucci has done much, much better.",1078617600,2,145,4.576923076923077
2059634,4,B00023P4HY,"I have been an admirer of Bernardo Bertolucci's work for quite some time. I have even reviewed many of his films, ""The Grim Reaper"", ""Last Tango In Paris"", ""Little Buddha"", and ""The Conformist"". There was a time I was completely under his spell, anything he did just seemed to reach at me and not let go. I don't want to say the Bertolucci of late has been terrible, but his works does not seem as daring as it once was. Say what you will about such films as ""Besieged"", ""Stealing Beauty"" & ""Little Buddha"" but to me they lacked something, here though Bertolucci offers us a glimpse of what was. I'm sure many people will draw comparisons to ""Last Tango In Paris"" when speaking of this film. In fact Bertolucci himself described it as ""First Tango In Paris"", but there are those you will agree this movie more than anything reminds us of the ""French New Wave"" and films by Godard and Truffaut.
 Jean-Luc Godard once said something along the lines of we say a movie is beautiful because we do not know what else to say. It is the highest compliment we can give it. Well, ""The Dreamers"" is a beautiful movie. Bertolucci has made a film that celebrates not only his love but our love of cinema. The movie kind of plays off the old cliche ideal lifestyle of the 60s ""sex, drugs, and rock n' roll"".
 ""The Dreamers"" has an American in Paris, played by Michael Pitt who forms a friend ship with Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) who happen to be brother and sister. This all takes place in 1968 just in time for the ""student revolution"". Now before I wrote the movie makes us think of the French new wave, we start thinking of Truffaut's ""Jules and Jim"" and Godard's ""Breathless"", and speaking of ""Breathless"" there is a scene were we see Jean Seberg. There are also movie clips featuring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert from ""Queen Christina"" and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers from ""Top Hat"". Jean Pierre Leaud even makes a cameo, and maybe some of us are thinking about ""400 Blows"". There are also intense movie conversations as Theo and Matthew discuss who was funnier Chaplin or Keaton?
 There is no way I could go into detail and describe what takes place in this movie, all I say is if you remember the old Bertolucci and enjoyed those films, ""The Dreamers"" will please you. It is the first movie I've seen in 04 and already I can call it a masterpiece.
 I also want to make a comment on the ridiculous NC-17 rating. First of all when most people hear a movie is rated NC-17 they immediately think it's going to be some trashy porno, this is not true and secondly, there is nothing here that Bertolucci has not done before and his films were rated R. I remember there being male frontal nudity in ""The Sheltering Sky"", I think there was in ""1900"", the fact that this movie is rated NC-17 to me has no justification whatsoever!
 Bottom-line: A movie that brings back the Bertolucci of old. It's more daring then his previous films. This is a movie that is really for film lovers to watch not the casual viewer. A masterpiece.",1077321600,8,3032,4.475587703435805
2059635,4,B00023P4HY,"The three protagonists in Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers are nave teenagers addicted to sex, politics, and cinema. They are so caught up in their idealistic doctrine that they are merely dreamers that have yet been waken up to the society around them.
Matthew (Michael Pitt) is a young American from San Diego. He spends his leisure time at the Cinematheque, sitting on the front row because he wants to be the first to breathe in the pictures. During his frequent visits to the Cinematheque, he notices Isabelle (Eva Green) and her twin brother Theo, although he does not know it yet (Louis Garrel). During one of the days of protesting, Matthew sees Isabelle tied to the gates with a heavy set of chains. (This would be the sign of sexual innuendos that would eventually become concentrated and receive the NC-17 rating it deserves.) He is attracted to her and vice-versa and share something in common; their love for the cinema. Eventually Theo and Isabelle invite Matthew to dinner in their house and during the dinner, we get the political aspects of The Dreamers between Theo and his father, a famous writer.
Politics though is not Theo, Isabelle, and Matthews main level of expertise, even if they believe otherwise. Their true passion and wit lies in cinema. They would regurgitate dialogues and reenact scenes. Eva Green does a great job in mimicking Greta Garbo in Queen Christina as she tenderly touches the wall and caressing the surfaces around the room. Bertolucci frequently cuts to old reels of these classic movies mirroring those being impersonated by his actors. Theo and Matthew have a face-off as to who is the greater artist, Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton. Of course Theo, the French, prefers Chaplin while Matthew, the American, dotes on Keaton. For any film lover who know their film history this would be a great conversation piece. I wouldnt have mind if I argued alongside them....",1077235200,4,1914,4.928792569659443
2059636,3,B00023P4HY,"The Dreamers is a new, primarily English-language film from the Italian king of cinematic controversy, Bernardo Bertolucci. If you've seen his past works, including 1900 and Last Tango in Paris, they provide a fairly clear idea of what to expect in this NC-17 foray into 1960's youth culture in France. The film is an extended analysis, really, of radicalism and some of the hypocrisies seemingly inherent in it. It forces us to confront the question of what truly is revolutionary, or conservative for that matter. The film answers that question in a way many of us will find unexpected.

Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American student spending time abroad in France. He takes in the student protests with wide eyes, gazing in awe at the pure passion igniting these young people. Though the period is the '60s, Matthew still reflects the tucked-in conservatism of a decade past, wearing a jacket and tie almost as a shield from the craziness surrounding him. He soon meets two French siblings, Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel), both of whom are full of the revolutionary spirit. They are new and therefore attractive to Matthew, who shares a mutual love of movies with both. Not long after, he moves into the home of his two new friends, whose parents have gone away on an extended trip.

Now is the time audience members may begin to squirm. In between quoting movies to one another and acting out favorite scenes, Matthew begins to notice an unnaturally clingy relationship exists between Isa and Theo--they sleep and bathe together, and play sexually-laced games that often leave one in some state of undress. But this quasi-incest has a strange effect on Matthew, as slowly, the jacket and tie disappear, he begins to walk around barely dressed, and he starts to take part in the sex games, at first begrudgingly and then yearningly.

But as intoxicated as Matthew becomes with the lifestyle, he also is disturbed when Isa confides in him that she's never been on a date before. Harboring some genuine feelings for the young beauty, Matthew tries to lead her away from a life entirely dependent upon Theo and toward one of independence. In this way, the film draws a very interesting parallel. It really is conservatism--a resistance to change--that is keeping so-called radicals Isa and Theo in their exclusive relationship. The young innocent, Matthew, has become the revolutionary in trying to shatter what has become the comfortable tradition.

The film boasts three good, but not great performances. With stronger leading work, a good film could possibly have reached the next level. Gilbert Adair's screenplay, based on his own novel, is wonderfully subtle in weaving its critique of the radical movement, but is in fact so subtle that in some ways the film feels ""small."" Nevertheless, the film raises probing questions, particularly in the last scene, as a throng of protesters march down a street, all chanting in unison, not a single one distinguishable from the next. It begs the old question, ""If a group of anarchists organize an anarchists' meeting, are they really anarchists anymore?""

Finally, credit must be heaped upon Fox Searchlight for not yielding to any suggestion that Bertolucci's vision be compromised by editing the film to achieve an R rating. Even without such censorship, it is disturbing enough that film footage of bare genitals and some sex is considered more damaging by the MPAA than, for example, the wholesale slaughter of recent horror offerings. In any case, when going to see The Dreamers, leave any prudish tendencies (or family members) at home.
Final Grade: B",1076889600,11,3621,5.0083056478405314
2059637,5,B00023P4HY,"i wrote a review for the soundtrack and it also makes sense here: to make a long rambling paragraph short... it takes serious balls make a movie like this and pull it off. The Dreamers does it and does it well. Most fall too heavily into their '60's' mode and use cliches. This takes those cliches and SUCEEDS and reminds exactly WHY so many have tried and failed before.
I've rarely sat in a movie and been completely jaw-dropped the entire film; rarely have i ever been completely engrossed for hours after; rarely has a movie had such a lasting effect on me... no lie.",1076803200,2,571,4.447619047619048
2059638,3,B00023P4HY,"I came away from this movie not quite knowing how to feel about it.  It is billed as a celebration of movies and the spirit of the sixties.  In the end, the film seems more of a condemnation of the libertinism and navet of those times.  The three young people of the movie do discuss movies, music, and politics - one discussion per  topic.  The problem I had was that the discussions weren't very insightful.  In a sense it is wonderful just to hear characters argue the greatness of Keaton versus Chaplin, but that topic is hardly original in this day and age and most film buffs (the primary audience for this movie) all ready have decided who is their favorite.  The same thing goes for the Hendrix vs. Clapton debate.
But, more to the point, I can't take anything a naked person says seriously.  I don't know if this is because they are inherently foolish or that I am just not listening.  There is a lot of sex and nudity in this movie.  It would have been missing the point to try to edit it down to an R rating.  About a half-hour into the movie, the characters take off their clothes and never seem to put them back on.  (I am not suggesting that this is a bad thing, by the way.)  This movie isn't really about the sixties because that is going on outside and these three never leave their apartment.
Yet, the film is not really a celebration of casting aside traditional morals about sex and incest.  Even in the logic of the film, the twins, Isabelle and Theo, are DEEPLY disturbed.  As intelligent as they are, they lead anything but healthy lives and are doomed to self-destruct.  Bertolucci may end up endorsing the very values he seeks to criticize.  Seen from the eyes of the American, Matthew, the sexual freedom France offers him is intoxicating.  He soon finds himself living a lifestyle beyond anything his middle-class mind could have envisioned.  Yet, the charm remains that he can escape at any time.  I do not see Matthew settling in Paris, but ultimately getting tired of his libertinism and returning to a traditional life in the states.
In the end, this film is a celebration of images: images from old movies and images of beautiful young naked bodies.  I do not mean to suggest that this is a bad film - it is not - just a flawed film.  It is still interesting, better than most new movies, and guaranteed to spark a lot of debates.  It also has inspired me to watch a lot of old film again, which is worthwhile enough in its own right.",1076284800,7,2466,4.431111111111111
2059639,5,B00023P4HY,"4 words guaranteed to strike fear and loathing into my heart are ""coming of age drama"".  This is usually journalistic shorthand for ""sentimental, uplifting, trite boredom drawn out over 2 or 3 hours with plenty of tears, orchestra swells and characters changing beyond recognition to facilitate plot movement"".  Thankfully the new movie from Bernardo Bertolucci falls into none of these traps.  There is very little crying, no rapid personality changes and the soundtrack is a magnificent collision of Jimi Hendrix and the Doors amongst others.
The Dreamers is set in Paris in 1968 and revolves around a visiting American student (who may or may not be dodging the draft) and the very friendly twins he meets at a local movie theatre.  And that's about it.  Not that this is a bad thing - the 3 lock themselves into an apartment and act out old movies, play games, have sex, hang out naked argue and get drunk, while the student revolution play out on the streets below.
The movie is beautifully shot in pastel hues and soft light, complementing the surprising amounts of nudity (Hence the NC17 cert- oh my god!! flaccid penis!! it's the end of western civilization!!!). Themes of incest, bisexuality, suicide, love, hate, violence and passive resistance are both explicitly explored and subtly hinted at.  Large parts of the movie are unexpected, unpredictable and frequently hilarious, reflecting the spontaneity of youth, and the fantastic imagination of the director. It's also a challenging movie about idealism, society and the generation gap, filtered through the eyes of naive individual.  There are also marvelous commentaries on art, literature, movies and music - the kind of stuff that matters to bedsit revolutionaries.  And personally I think Hendrix was waaaaay better than Clapton!
An interesting point that rings true today is where the American character finds himself having to justify the actions of his government and it's armed forces, while he doesn't agree with the Vietnam war, he struggles to point out that the soldiers fighting it would probably rather not be there too - a point that will touch a nerve with any American who's been abroad recently and found themselves on the receiving end of a broadside that's unjustifiable and yet somewhat understandable at the same time...
The 2 ""French"" actors are incredible, and believable - the American chap looks too much like Leonardo DiCaprio, and never quite decides if he's awkward and gauche or moralistic and profound - I think he lacks the maturity to play the role convincingly, and for me was a low point in an otherwise fantastic movie.
I felt the end was also somewhat weak.  In the movie theatre where I watched it everyone sat in their seats stunned while the credits rolled, waiting for a resolution.  But a good artist always leaves them wanting more, and Bertolucci should be justifiably proud of this particular piece of art.  Perhaps it'll even inspire America's cynical and apathetic youth to rise up and get involved, just like 1968 all over again....",1076112000,3,3044,5.031809145129225

2059645,5,B00023P4HY,"This is a very sexy, no-holds-barred film featuring total nudity which begins in the second half.  Bernardo Bertolucci is well known for his having lots of nudity in his films....notably Last Tango in Paris, in which he wanted to have Marlon Brando actually screw Maria Schneider, and using butter as lubricant.  I've followed the director's film starting with his first film Before the Revolution, based on Stendahl-s  masterpiece brought up to modern times....no nudity there.  The Last Emperor is another remarkable work.
  Michael Pitt is a fine actor and so are the sister and brother with whom he shares sex.  It's 1968 amid the student riots which rocked the capitals of America and Europe alike.  The scenes of the rioting at the end are very realistic.  The extras have Bertolucci telling exactly what he was trying to achieve and which he did certainly achieve and comparing them with the actual footage which still exists.
  In the end it turns out that the American, Pitt, is much more conservative than his French friends.  His wardrobe from the beginning says as much.

The story just drags on simply to just show more frontal nudity (don't get me wrong, nudity does not bother me, but I want a story that flows well and doesn't put me to sleep); in addition all I really get from the film is that these young adults are just spoiled brats who have no respect for their parents or their parents belongings (the fact that it is the 60s in Paris does not change this); I don't think the check at the end was for more groceries, I think it was a check for them to move out and end their ties with their parents; and finally the acting is ok but the directing in the film is horrible.",1482710400,,896,4.00561797752809

She had separate interests as her room attests, but her first love was definitely her brother.  Whether Theo's thoughts included her were explored, but it was clear that she was distraught at him finding a lover.  She broke first.  And she accomplished this without being weak.

Matthew/Michael Pitt is an American in Paris, and he becomes involved w/ twins, who love the cinema as much as he.  Theo and Isabel live a life indulgence, supported by checks from their scholar father, as their mother accompanies her husband.

Director, Bertolucci, certainly evokes a sense of 1960's Paris and includes many clips and Q & A sessions of 'classic' cinema for film buffs, but the story soon becomes tedious and like the characters, is shallow and pretentious.  Word of mouth spread quickly about the films sexual frankness and there is plenty of flesh on display (Green is an absolute must-see undressed).  Oh, to be young, pampered and with parents handing out cheques like lollies to finance any and all whims and indulgences!

The film was more than just an erotic independent movie it was full of drama and an original storyline. This is common among most independent movies which I am a huge fan of. The dreamers comes in two different versions the rated R and the NC-17 uncut version. I first saw the R version and thought it was very good but now I owen the Uncut original version and it is great.

I only buy movies that are ""classic"" in my opinion, they will never go out of style for me and I will enjoy it again in the future, just as much as I did when I first viewed it.  I love movies.  I am addicted to them.  I used them to escape from my reality.  I mainly enjoy independent films, most of which I find much more thought provoking then huge Hollywood blockbusters that show in the theaters.

This movie had my attention from the very first scene with Michael Pitt and his gorgeous, boyish face.  Add the beautiful European scenery backdrops, the French accents, the three main cast members being film and music buffs, the parents going out of town for a month, the psychological and sexual games-- it was like I was experiencing my teens and 20's all over again.

It had me from the very first scene and it was like watching a movie in a dream.  The only minus in this movie is the ending; very abrupt and predictable.",1398124800,,1004,4.26984126984127
2059749,4,B00023P4HY,"This film plays fine in the Blu-ray player on a 1080 P screen.  Due to the fact that this film was not popular at release, it has not made it into the Blu-ray genre.

The film is set in Paris during the spring 1968. While students take to the streets in the Spring 'revolution', a French poet's twin son Theo and daughter Isabelle enjoy the good life in his grand Paris home. It appears that this apartment is south of the Ile de la Cite in the Luxembourg Gardens district.  I recently passed through this area on a trip from Montparnasse to Austerlitz train stations.  They meet conservatively educated Californian student Matthew. While their parents are away for a month, they introduce him into a graphic orgy of indulgence of all senses, losing all of his and the last of their innocence. This highly graphic and  sexual encounter may be shocking to some, but it is strikingly French.  All this goes on with the back drop of the students rebelling.

Eva Green, a French born English actress plays the unforgettable Isabelle (one of the twins).  One of my favorite actresses is in her early 20s in the film.  She recently played Artemisia in the movie ""300 Rise of an Empire."" The nude scenes of her are remarkable and the graphic sexuality is overwhelming.  The setting that the Bertolucci creates is real in the  flat even down to the dishes in the sink.",1396137600,,1360,4.578512396694215

Filmed in France the movie is about an American college student who arrives in Paris in 1968 who spends weeks with a rather odd brother and sister who turn out to be fraternal twins. Set in the backdrop of the Paris Riots and the Vietnam War, the movie explores what youth was going through at that particular time in history: it was either a time of killing and war or a time of love and the trio wisely at first decide love to be the way to live.

Matthew (played by Michael Pitt)--the American outsider that soon becomes the missing piece in the lives of twin brother and sister, Isabelle and Theo (played by Eva Green and Louis Garrel).

The twins are cinema buffs and meet Matthew with like interests. They quickly become friends and Matthew is soon invited to live with them, in the anticipated vacation-absence of their parents. And ""when the cat is away"" these college age youths have opportunity to play. The game is to recognize a movie from pantomime acting.  The loser must forfeit, and the winner chooses the punishment. Isabelle is first to stump her brother and requires a most exotic act of him. Then, Theo stumps Michael, and to get even with his sister, requires them to perform an erotic act in his presence.

Michael soon realizes they are playing at being children. He protests, but the protests fall on deaf ears. As his protests threaten the relationship, Paris succumbs to student riots and youth is forever shattered.

2059799,5,B00023P4HY,"This is an amazing movie.  If you have been reading any of these reviews I am sure it goes without saying that it is not for everyone so I won't dwell on that.  I will address the nudity/sexual aspects of the film up front by simply repeating what many of the other reviews have said: there is certainly nudity, openly sexual scenes, and a variety of taboos explored in varying degrees, but they are presented rather matter-of-fact and not with strong eroticism (though, I admit that for any red-blooded, heterosexual male, even if she were just sorting socks or filling out a tax return, it would be hard to judge any scene with a nude Eva Green as ""not erotic"").

I believe that the sex primarily reinforces the innocence, or naivete, of the twins' -- Isabelle and Theo's -- private universe where they, as spoiled child-adults, endulge any desire or whim.  This is in contrast to the anger and intensity which dominates their pretense at social-activism, driven by  simple-minded reaction (war -- bad) to the turbulent times (the 60's).  But they are just two sides to the same coin -- they truly are ""Dreamers"", detached from reality by a wall of denial.  When anything happens which forces them to deal with reality, such as having the true nature of their relationship discovered by their parents, the results are not pretty.  (Actually, it is a little ambitious to suggest that their parents discovered the true nature of their relationship when it isn't clear that even they understand the true nature of this confusing mix of polyamory, bisexuality, incest, voyeurism, fraternity, obsession, and just a hint of sadomasochism.)  Matthew, the young American student whom they ""adopt,"" is torn between the seductive nature of their universe (including his attraction to and love of Isabelle and Theo) and his own grounding in reality -- though he is as young as they are, he possesses a maturity and true thoughtulness which they lack. So long as they all remain primarily isolated in their apartment, their private universe mostly prevails, but in the end their differences in the ""real"" world is what tears them apart.

The acting is superb throughout -- there is some very impressive work here.  The cinematography is also excellent and the use of clips from classic films is brilliant, reinforcing not only the establishment of the characters' love of cinema but also the degree to which these ""dreamers"" are lost within their fantasies.  The ending is amazing and rather abrupt.  (mild spoiler alert) It will likely leave most viewers feeling a bit unfulfilled but that fits the movie. The ending likely would leave the characters feeling unfulfilled -- ultimately, no matter how much he wanted to be a part of Isabelle and Theo's universe, Matthew could never remain there.  When reality came crashing through, the characters acted according to their nature and their differences severed the bond for good.

Some have complained that the film is too slow.  It is a bit slow but when doing a character-study, how much ""study"" is too much?  How much is enough?  I, personally, was riveted throughout.  Those who were not riveted, likely weren't really connecting with the movie anyway and more aggessive editing likely would not have changed that.  The movie is not for everyone.

The only other Bernardo Bertolucci movie I have seen is ""Last Tango in Paris"" about which I was not very enthusiastic.  It was an impressive film but ultimately I could not buy into the story -- I found the characters and situations ultimately unbelievable and that made all the good things in it difficult to appreciate.  The same thing could have happened here -- these characters certainly are not like anyone I know or would even imagine but the acting, the script, and the directing drew me in -- I rather imagine that for many, that was not enough, and they wound up disliking the film as a result.  I can't explain why it worked for me and I sure can't say whether it will work for you but the bottom line is, it worked for me.  I enjoyed this movie.",1351036800,12,4048,4.8234442836468885
2059800,4,B00023P4HY,"Once again, Bertolucci explores his favorite themes of politics, the nature of individuality vs. belonging and
transgressive sex.

In 1968 Paris, as the protests that began around cinema threaten to expand and bring down the
government, an odd manage-a-trios develops between a young American and a twin brother and
sister, whose relationship is full of borderline incest.  The three form a tight circle and almost forget
the world outside while dunk on booze, sexuality,and each other.  But by the end, the maelstrom outside
is too powerful to simply be ignored.

This is a very good film, but for me, not quite a great one.  The depths of these characters aren't explored the
way Bertolucci does in, say `The Conformist', and there are even some places where it feels like he pulls his
punches (not a director one thinks of doing so.) But the homosexual attraction between the brother and the
American is reduced to an occasional ambiguous smoldering glance.  That aspect, among others, was far
more explicit in the novel.

None-the-less, the film is beautifully made (some terrific editing that inserts images from other films that
relate to and comment on the story), and the acting is solid (and bold.  While the sex itself isn't that much more
explicit than in many R rated films, the amount of relaxed nudity is, and that meant these young actors had to
really throw off their inhibitions to make many scenes work.

2059804,3,B00023P4HY,"Watch the movie first but make sure to watch the featurette with Bernardo Bertolucci that follows.  You will see the ache of an older man who misses an exciting time in history and in his youth. The movie uses the closing of the Cinematheque Francaise, the firing of its director, Henri Langlois, and the student riots that ensued in 1968 as its background.

As the social upheaval of the times explodes in the streets of Paris, three young people detach themselves from its reality in order to engage in sexual daring and fantasy.  A young American in Paris to study French meets a young woman protesting at the gate of the Cinematheque at the beginning of the unrest.  After that, however, she and her brother retreat with the American to their parents' comfortable' Paris flat in search of something far different from freedom for cinematic art. Their use of cinematic knowledge is far more foreplay than study; more
carnal than academic.

The parents leave for the country and the young people rarely venture out after that. Exploring their sensuality within the flat outweighs the more nebulous  social upheaval taking place outside their windows on the streets of Paris.  Their private exploration is very sexually explicit and not for an 'R'-rated mindset.

The twin brother, Theo, and the American, Matthew, become the objects of Isabelle's sexual experimentation. In a daring role for a future Bond girl,  Eva Grant, leaves nothing hidden.  Matthew has her graphically. Theo has his sister in a secretly incestuous way-maybe. Each viewer will need to decide that on their own.  It is never really clear.

What seems to begin as a tribute to a fight for the freedom of the art of the cinema becomes a graphic attempt at sexual liberation in that time. It is both exhilarating and at times a confusing experience for the three protagonists. Bertolucci leaves the judgment of their failure or
 success to his audience. That is the European way in cinema.",1335225600,5,1960,4.903030303030303

2059817,4,B00023P4HY,"This film has very european sensibilities, and does a good job at creating a
dream-state / erotic experimental atmosphere.
Michael Pitt, who is now a big star because of his major role in HBO's
Scorcesse-directed mega-hit ""Boardwalk Empire"", really was a young lion in this film,
and turns in a very knaively sexy performance in this Bertulucci vehicle.
Basically, he's a young student from America, who comes to Paris to study, as millions have before him.
He gets swept up in the intrigue of this mysterious and uncomfortably sexual young Parisian
brother-sister pair (Isabelle & Theo), and they become a threesome of sorts: sharing intimacies of all kinds.
If full-on nudity & unbridled sexuality turn you off, or is embarasssing to you, then this isn't
your kind of film. But there is an innocence to their sexuality which isn't seedy at all.
Michael Pitt's character falls madly and passionately in love with Isabelle, but there is also
a sexual tension and comfort level he shares with her brother, Theo...who has a smoldering quality to him.
Though all three are attractive, the male-female dynamic of this strange liason is played up more between
Pitt's character and Isabelle, while the unspoken desire between the two young men is downplayed
and hardly touched on except in an awkward wrestling scene on the bed late in the film.
Just like in ""Brokeback Mountain"", the sexuality of the men always has to be played out in a
struggle for dominance-type of thing, usually followed by the defeated party being the submissive.
In a lot of mainstream cinema, this awkwardness and near rape between two men seems to be
the only way that some in Hollywood can depict intimacy between two handsome masculine men.
As if the two can't just simply find each other attractive and consent to being together.

I personally felt that the threesome thing should have been explored
all the way around!--That would've been even hotter! (-:
But this film isn't all about young bohemian college kids exploring themselves....
It takes place amid the turbulent late 60's, (1968 to be exact), which was not only a
turbulent time in America, but also in Paris as well.
REVOLUTION is all around them, and yet they are encapsulated from it all as well.
Finally, as it always does, reality has to come in and destroy their little erotic never-never land
dream bubble, and there is the inevitable revelatory moment, which shakes the wide-eyed idealists from their dream.

Overall, I found this film to be good, but the story seemed to get murky in certain places, and like I said,
(for my money) I think the whole sexual dynamic should have been explored between the three, since they
had already implied incest between Theo & Isabelle anyway, and Pitt's character and Theo defintely
had a silent thing too!
I think that it would've made it even more interesting.
To me, the ending, though I got it, was still kind of weak.
Since you can't give 3 1/2 stars on here, I'll go ahead and say an even 4 stars.",1308700800,9,2985,4.816764132553606

I concede that the actors are beautiful, and that their performances are remarkable (otherwise why should I be so upset?!), but for me the movie was a waste of time:  I really don't care much about these people, what they think, or what happens to them.  Perhaps that's because I and my friends were activists  -  we marched and picketed against missile bases in England, we fasted one day a week and contributed the money saved to famine relief in Africa, and we cared very much about the sort of world that we would inherit.

What had played out before me was at once sensual, sexual, erotic--but not overly so--sinfully voyeuristic, and politically charged.  It was a study in excess, of youthful indulgence and sexual exploration, of idealistic fervor both realized and unfulfilled.  It was beautiful and ugly, titillating yet repulsive.  And in the end I was drawn to the movie, a voyeur peering in on the lives of three humans as their world narrowed to just the three, where nothing else matter but the pleasure and pain they could inflict on one another in the name of love.

The Story

Based on the novel The Holy Innocents: A Romance by Gilbert Adair, who also wrote the screenplay, The Dreamers is the latest film by renowned and controversial Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci; it is in fact his 22nd offering in a long and distinguished career.  Bertolucci has described The Dreamers as being about three utopias centered on his memories of May 1968: political, cinematic and sexual.

The Dreamers open on Paris, beautiful, sensual, romantic Paris, in 1968 when it seemed the whole world was on fire.  The month is February, and a young American, Matthew, portrayed by Michael Pitt, meets French twins Th&eacute;o portrayed by newcomer Louis Garrel, and Isabelle portrayed with soft sensuality by newcomer Eva Green, at the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que Francaise during the Langlois Affair a demonstration against the firing of its leader, Henri Langlois.  The Langlois Affair was widely heralded as a forerunner of the May uprising by French students.  In a wonderful elegiac tableau, Bertolucci splices together archive shots of French director Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud giving a passionate speech in defense of Langlois, with his own shots of L&eacute;aud today reproducing the same event.

Matthew, a regular at the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que has had his eye on Isabelle for quite some time. He has been watching her almost daily through the semi-dark of the packed auditorium.  So Matthew is thrilled with the pair invite him to dinner in the family apartment, where he meets their English mother (Anna Chancellor) and French father (Robin Renucci), a noted author.

The twins are taken with Matthew and after their parents leave for places unknown, they invite him to stay in the apartment with them, and the new three friends begin a life of reclusive bohemia. At first they just discuss politics and play games like film-buff, but increasingly as Matthew is drawn deeper into their world, the twins begin to play sexual games as well.  Matthew discovers that the twins sleep nude together and during a round of film-buff in which Th&eacute;o loses, Isabelle makes him masturbate in front of her and Matthew, who is taken aback.  Later, during another round of film-buff, Th&eacute;o wins and sensing Matthew's barely masked attraction to Isabelle, orders the two to have sex in front of him.  At first Matthew resists; his American sensibilities can't imagine such a thing, but the sight of a now naked Isabelle excites him and he gives into temptation, making love to Isabelle on the kitchen floor, while Th&eacute;o fries eggs.  At the end of their coupling Matthew discovers Isabelle was a virgin, or was she just experiencing her time of the month?  The blood doesn't tell.

The die is cast, and the two make love all over the apartment taking pleasure from each other in long stretches, heedless of the now forgotten Th&eacute;o. Before long Matthew falls in love with Isabelle and her with him, but he cannot have her all to himself, because while Isabelle may well be in love Mathew, she is deeper in love with Th&eacute;o; the twin may have never consummated tier attraction in the old fashioned way, but they are engaged in a every thickening dance of emotional incest...

A lighting rod for controversy Bernardo Bertolucci is nonetheless one of the world's foremost directors.  His predilection for exploring the carnal side of human nature in his films has brought him much ridicule and acclaim, but none can deny his brilliance as a director.  Much criticism was heaped upon the cinematic shoulders of The Dreamers before its release because of the often raw depiction of nudity, sexuality and its underlying current of incest.  Quite frankly after the initial titillation, I found the movie hardly erotic or proactive at all; it was in the end a film about exploration and awakening, both of sexual and political awareness.  But all-n-all there was surprising little sex in The Dreamers.

It is interesting that only Matthew seems to have any sense of morality, or common sense for that matter.  It is the twins that draw him into their web of sexual gamesmanship and depravity; it is Isabelle who instigates the first sexual game, and it is Th&eacute;o who cajoles Mathew into having sex with Isabelle; and it is the twins who seem to knock down all barriers in pursuit of pleasure to the exclusion of all else.  Matthew is just along for the ride, the proverbial wide-eyed innocent and ignorant American.

The performance by the three principle characters was nothing short of suburb.  At first I did not care for Michael Pitt's portrayal of Matthew, but as the movie progressed I warmed to him.  Eva Green's portrayal of Isabelle was masterful and brave, and all three actors deserve a round of applause for portrayals of characters that must have been hard to embrace given the morally charged material.
If I have one criticism about the movie, it is that we really never gain a firm understanding as to why the twins are the way they are.  Why the deep emotion connection; from what well did it spring?  Is it their shared love of the cinema, or is it the close bound all twins share taken to a new level, flirting with physical incest, while fully embracing emotional incest?

The ending coming abruptly as it did, let me feeling strangely unfulfilled.  It's as if I wanted more; the voyeur in me wanted to continue to stare through the window of the trio's lives and see what came next.  That to me is the measure of how good The Dreamers was and I suppose is.",1290211200,6,6132,4.919417475728156
2059825,2,B00023P4HY,"The Dreamers is supposed to be a graphic erotic drama that takes place in Paris during the 60s. Maybe I am just a sick, but I did not find the nudity offensive or provocative. You do not actually see a full threesome or any of the sorts. It is only nudity and a fake sex scene. Towards the end of the movie, when Matthew, Isabelle, and Theo were sleeping under the tent naked, it merely resembled little babies taking a nap. I cannot believe the parents just walked out after they saw that. They just pooped in their pants and left. Very odd parents they were. The acting was well done throughout. I wasn't impressed with the film though, I was more annoyed like Matthew was about the twins' relationship with each other. The twins were really in a world of their own. I think Matthew was really heart broken when the twins decided to leave and continue with the riot. He had to learn the hard way that threesomes never work. Someone is always left out. The ending was rather bleak. They could have at least shown the twins getting clobbered on the street or something. I didn't see a whole lot of Europe in this. Only a few streets were shown. Then there is a riot concerning the suffering French film industry. I loved the apartment. There were a lot of references to classic films. That was more interesting then what was going on in the movie. I would have felt better about the film if there was continuity with the movie club.",1287619200,2,1432,4.407547169811321
2059826,4,B00023P4HY,"There are two DVD versions, 'R' and 'NC-17' and I suggest there is a choice to be made; a choice not helped by Amazon's mis-representation of the product. The R version is not 115 minutes as stated on Amazon's product info at the time of this writing (Sept. 2010), it is 112 minutes. The NC-17 version is 115 minutes. In the Star Trek film First Contact, Data says point zero six eight seconds is nearly a lifetime to an android. In The Dreamers, cutting three minutes also cuts some hugrly important character development and coming fully of age, shown mainly in the more open and explicit sexuality. How can I describe the choice of version you will wonder about? It is perhaps be the difference between a European and an American sensibility. The NC-17 version has far more graphic sexuality that in North America would be treated much more privately, and in films made in NA, not shown on screen. Either version of the film has plenty to say and think about, more perhaps in the uncut NC-17 version if you want to explore those different sensibilities. Either version you will find thought-provoking about what has happened to us and what we have become through the interaction of our personality and our surrounding history and each interacting within and around us affecting the other: the R version more on a wider political and social level we take for granted in NA, the NC-17 version I think better integrating that with more deeply personal and sexual awakening too. The NC-17 version however will not be to everyone's taste and is not for the squeamish or more 'proper.'

The Dreamers is a provocatively brilliant film. A look at growing up and a character study of the world and us, in 1968, the year of the largest strike in world history (11 million in France and spontaneously at that), the year of the assassination of Martin Luther King, and of Bobby Kennedy; the year of riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the beginning of the ensuing Chicago Seven conspiracy trial. The world was changing radically and everywhere. Mark Kurkansky work a detailed and fascinating book about it titled '1968.' Denise Levertov commented correctly I think that: ""America did not enter the 20th century until the 1960s, and in this film the turmoil of such a late and relatively sudden entrance is both reflected and brought inside the initial seeming cocoon of the Paris apartment of the young protagonists who are also 'growing up' and awakening personally, politically, and sexually, like the rest of the world.

Ironically, at that time, through behaviour that looked adolescently narcissistic, a degree of narcissism was lost, thankfully, in a world where power held by an older generation was not infrequently so self-indulgently mis-used, and oftenalso, as in the film, as the parents did, simply abrogated to those who would mis-use it by the others not taking any kind of engaged stance in parenting or in the world, isolating themselves in a sea-side vacation a deux - helping enable all the rest that happens to the young protagonists and the world. The two polar opposites, engagement and its lack, are the two inter-dependent tension points inextricably intertwined in the film, and in life and history.

This is Bertolucci's look at this most complicated of times, a time that initially gave us hope and optimism, and then in reaction, gave us Nixon, Watergate, Reagan, and Thatcher and ultimately re-directed political and personal energies that have led to even worse narcissism, and yet to places as diverse and good for us as the slow food movement and environmentalism. There is a lot to think about from this film and from our history and personal journey through the time it depicts (and any time really), which, as Bertolucci points out in his commentary, we have only just begun to explore; a time, difficult with dense experience and feelings and difficult for most of us to figure out without more life experience, time. and perspective. A film highly recommended.",1285545600,,4011,4.904270986745214

2059828,4,B00023P4HY,"Political unrest, cinematic musing and unbridled erotica come together almost magically in director Bernardo Bertolucci's controversial film `The Dreamers'.  While it is far from `Last Tango in Paris', to completely shrug off the films merits as nothing more than youthful porn would be a mistake.  While the young and obviously attractive cast sheds clothing and performs countless suggestive acts with one another, the heart and soul of `The Dreamers' is far more complicated than a mere act of sexual aggression.  `The Dreamers' is an interesting character study that benefits from drawing comparisons to the films of which it obviously admires, namely anything French new wave (which is especially exciting for me).

The film revolves around a threesome, French twins Isabelle and Theo and American student Michael.  Bonding over their love of film and their obvious physical attributes, the mismatched threesome begin a troubled affair during a dangerous time.  The film unfolds rather bluntly, with elongated scenes involving depravity that is masked over by a sense of naivity needed to fully understand the state with which these `kids' find themselves.  Decieved by their own communities and blinded by their own passions, the group finds that reality is never as kind as one would expect, and when morality and human nature begin to erode the core of their bond, the begin to fray rather rapidly.

Anyone who is familiar with the films of Bernardo Bertolucci knows that he has a thing for nudity and sexual exploitation.  `The Dreamers' is full of that.  If you are offended by mature and often graphically controversial content then stay far away from this film.  The taboo subject of incest and bi-sexuality are tackled here openly and without hesitation.  It is a film that could easily offend those not prepared for what they are in store for.

While the bulk of `The Dreamers' may not come together as definitively as Bertolucci may have wished, it does certainly remain provoking in tone and remarkably memorable, even if it is for the wrong reasons at times (and yet, are they really the wrong reasons).  I don't think that this film speaks as poignantly about human relationships and personal growth as `Last Tango in Paris' did, but it does manage to crawl under the skin with its blatant fearlessness.

The performances captured here are all very good, especially that of Eva Green who is absolutely stunning (one of the most beautiful women alive) and just effortlessly captivating.  She captures the audience with her luscious eyes and continues to bait us with her unwavering understanding of her characters human flaws.  Louis Garrel is a very strong presence here, understanding the complexities that come from a boy in his position and he plays to that strength remarkably well here.  You believe the jealousy in his eyes and the frayed morality that has come from a life of secrets.  Michael Pitt is not an actor I generally appreciate.  I find him rather one-note.  His boyish features and sheepish presence actually lay nice layers to Matthew's overall persona and compliment the strength found in his co-stars.

A film that uncovers the dangers of social segregation, `The Dreamers' is far more than it appears to be, even if it doesn't quite become everything it tried to be.",1284336000,2,3306,5.060885608856089
2059829,3,B00023P4HY,"I spent couple months in Paris and the surrounding cities in the summer of 1965. It was a beautiful city and I enjoyed seeing it again in this film. The nastiness which resulted in the riots depicted in the film was already evident in 1965 and I felt somewhat uneasy at being there, although all the French people treated us very well.

I bought ""The Dreamers"" as one of three ""adult DVDs"" for late night viewing with my wife. The first was ""Forbidden"" and was neither a good film, nor was it arousing. The second was ""The Ranch,"" which was a surprisingly enjoyable film. Last night we watched ""The Dreamers.""

""The Dreamers"" is a serious film and I would recommend it strongly to someone  who was deeply immersed in the cinema and it's history. I'm sure a dyed-in-the wool film buff would love it. However, I'm not a film buff and the movie became progressively tedious to view. It was rated NC-17 and earned it with a lot of nudity and sex scenes. I did not find such scenes to be particularly interesting or arousing, but at least they were a part of a well thought out story. A lot of people loved the movie, that's for sure, but if I had to give it a one-word review, the word would be boring. It just didn't hit me where I'm at and that's probably partly my fault. In any case, it was nice to see Paris again.

The scene where she appears as Venus de Milo, dressed accordingly (ahem), and what follows after that, are worth the price of admission.  Come to think of it, you're probably better off fast forwarding through all the scenes in which she does not appear because all you'll get is radical-chic chit chat from Eva's twin brother, a spoiled brat with a head full of nonsense about revolution and Mao and the little red book and all that guff, and the rather wimpy American kid from California who tries to set him straight but without much luck (surprise!)  Well, it's the 60s dontcha know, rebellion was in the air, or something like that, let's hit the streets carrying the communist flag and slug it out with the police.  That'll fix what's wrong, you bet.  Tell it to Tianamen Square.

Of course, you're supposed to identify with the American kid in Paris (I did) who runs into the adorable Eva and her bro, shacks up with both, has a great time, falls in love with Eva (who wouldn't?), can't keep his hands off her or stay out of her or off her or whatever (who could?) and is very much down in the dumps at the end when Eva dumps him because her bond with bro is just too strong.  I would have written a different ending, with Eva achieving liberation -- it is the 60s after all -- but that's just me.

There are lots of movie quotes (an idea from Godard), though Bertolucci does his best to deflate the facile left-wing politics we get from Godard, and pretty much succeeds.  Paris looks wonderful, the mad dash through the Louvre was a lot of fun to watch (would never be allowed to be filmed today), and being in Paris in your 20s with not care in the world except how to make Eva happy, even for a brief time, sure is a version of paradise ... or something.",1253145600,3,1877,4.433139534883721

2059843,3,B00023P4HY,"Bernardo Bertolucci's 2003 film THE DREAMERS is an adaptation of Gilbert Adair's novel ""The Holy Innocents"". Although Adair has recently been in the news for his translation of George Perec's quirky novel ""La Disparation"" (as A VOID), his own fiction had been somewhat forgotten, but it's good that Bertolucci brought this remarkable story to wider attention. In 1968 Matthew (Michael Pitt), an American young man studying in Paris, encounters the French twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Teo (Louis Garrel). Moving into their apartment while their parents on holiday, Matthew enters into a bizarre tradition of sexual escapades, and the trio retreats into their own private world as the '68 Paris spring of violent demonstrations unfolds outside.

The plot is highly original and thought-provoking. As a movie viewer interested in the international underground of the late 1960s, I enjoyed the point that the events of 1968 were a confrontation between a humane, sincere idealism and rash, irresponsible hedonism. However, I can give the film only a very mixed review. In terms of acting, Michael Pitt drags the film down considerably. In scenes with Garrel and Green, he seems almost amateur, able to offer pretty-boy poses but not put any life into his character. Speaking of Green, although she is an attractive woman who spends much of the film frontally nude, her sexuality inspires no prurient interest because she so convincingly plays a madwoman. Every move she makes is a threat.

2059845,5,B00023P4HY,"Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American studying in Paris. When he's not studying, he goes out to see films at the cinmatque franaise; and after a while, he notices/is noticed by fellow cinephiles Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel).

------------------------------
Matthew: The first time I saw a movie at the cinmatque franaise I thought, ""Only the French... only the French would house a cinema inside a palace.""
========================================

Theo and Isabelle are brother and sister, twins even, and they have an unusually close relationship, bordering on incest. They decide to invite Matthew into their little circle, however; and invite him to have dinner at their place. Matthew meets their mother, an English woman, which explains why they speak English so well, and their father, an author and intellectual. As luck would have it, they are leaving Paris for the summer, and Matthew, Isabelle, and Theo are left to their own devices.

They create their own little world, rarely venturing outside. Theo and Isabelle are the purest of the pure cinephiles. They refuse to watch television, even if the news is broadcasting events that will soon shatter their insulated world. The soundtrack plays music by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and The Doors, seemingly foreshadowing some imminent doom, as Jimi, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison would all soon leave behind this mortal coil.

Jim Morrison would even pass away right in Paris, and be buried at the Cimetire du Pre Lachaise, alongside such poets and artists as Honor de Balzac, Guillaume Apollinaire, Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Bizet, Frdric Chopin, Eugne Delacroix, Isadora Duncan, Stphane Grappelli, Amedeo Modigliani, Moliere, Yves Montand, dith Piaf, Marcel Proust, Gioacchino Rossini, Georges-Pierre Seurat, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Oscar Wilde.

It is May of 1968, and that was a time of worldwide unrest, especially in Paris. A general strike of students and young people would soon escalate into chaos and confrontation.

But for now, Matthew, Theo, and Isabelle amuse themselves with sex, drugs, rock and roll, and enacting scenes from classic films. Theo plays Paul Muni in Scarface (1932). Isabelle does scenes from Blonde Venus (1932) and Queen Christina (1932). She quizzes them and challenges them to name a movie where someone was driven mad by tap dancing; and Matthew guesses correctly that it was Top Hat (1935), with Fred Astaire. They argue over who was the best comedian: Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton; with Theo throwing in a reference to Jerry Lewis, much to Matthew's consternation. They argue over who is the best guitarist: Clapton or Hendrix, and ponder why it is that the French can never produce any worthwhile rock and roll bands. They enact the scene from Bande  part (1964) and race through the Louvre, breaking the record set in the original film. This leads to them chanting ""one of us, one of us"" and accepting Matthew into their inner circle, just like the scene in Todd Browning's Freaks (1932) when the trapeze artist marries the midget and the sideshow freaks attempt to welcome her into the fold.

All this comes together in a brilliant film by director Bernardo Bertolucci; who seemed to stumble off his pedestal a bit with Stealing Beauty (1996); but has regained his footing with The Dreamers. Bertolucci's best work -- his heyday -- if you will, were the films he made with Vittorio Storraro, the cinematographer; and production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti. Though those two venerable colleagues are absent from The Dreamers, he has no doubt found adequate replacements, along with his mojo. From the opening scene where Matthew is going to the cinmatque franaise, set to Third Stone From the Sun by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, I knew I was going to enjoy this cinematic experience. It is a cinephile's dream: a film about cinephiles, with all the exciting events of Paris in May, 1968, as a backdrop.

Parts of The Dreamers are a lot like Alfonso Cuarn's Y tu mam tambin (2001) or Nagasi Oshima's Ai no corrida (In The Realm of the Senses, 1976), where political turmoil is glimpsed only peripherally, ignored by those too engrossed in their own drama to notice.

The cast, especially the three cinephiles, the dreamers in question, are excellent. Michael Pitt's name might remind you of Brad Pitt (no relation), but he looks like a rough trade version of Leonardo DiCaprio or River Phoenix. He arrived in New York from New Jersey with absolutely nothing in his pockets and proceeded to make a name for himself. He is an intense young actor, and he also does a more than credible version of ""Hey, Joe"" that is featured on the soundtrack. The song works not only as a tribute to Jimi Hendrix, but also as an underpinning for Matthew and Theo's debate over the Viet Nam War.

Louis Garrel, who plays Isabelle's brother Theo, looks like John Kennedy Jr., and he does a great job acting in English. He has done a ton of films, but they are all in French, so he is not so well known to the English speaking audience. Theo has a lot of conflicting forces pulling on him in all directions: his sister, Matthew, his girlfriend, his friends who are pressuring him to be more active in politics and the ongoing strike.

I can't say who Eva Green looks like -- she is an original; but I can say that she is very beautiful, and a very intense thespian that portrayed a complex and enigmatic character as if it was the easiest thing in the world. All three are fearless, as their roles required a lot of nudity. They pulled it off well, looking very natural au naturel. The Dreamers was the first film in a long while to be theatrically released with an NC-17 rating. It was brave of Bertolucci to resist self censoring, as the nudity was integral to the story, and to the world the three created.

Bertolucci should have no regrets about The Dreamers. It is a bold cinematic triumph, and it ends appropriately with ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" (1956), a song written by Charles Dumont and Michel Vaucaire and performed by dith Piaf.

Matthew: I was one of the insatiables. The ones you'd always find sitting closest to the screen. Why do we sit so close? Maybe it was because we wanted to receive the images first. When they were still new, still fresh. Before they cleared the hurdles of the rows behind us. Before they'd been relayed back from row to row, spectator to spectator; until worn out, secondhand, the size of a postage stamp, it returned to the projectionist's cabin. Maybe, too, the screen was really a screen. It screened us... from the world.

Though Eva Green is gorgeous to look at and it's nice to see a movie in which sex plays a large role that doesn't make sex look choreographed, The Dreamers never manages to capture the potential of its sexual-freedom-meets-May68 plot and thus remains more of an interesting failure than an accomplished movie.",1233792000,,327,4.945454545454545

Set during the Vietnam War era of France as they faced a growing tide of youthful communist movement and political unrest, it shows the economic hardships of French society and its youth. Overall, it was a very realistic and heartwarming account of the time in France.",1232323200,4,539,4.806451612903226
2059852,5,B00023P4HY,"While there is full-frontal nudity, implied incest, and soft-core sex aplenty, this film is, in reality, a stunning indictment of the empty value system of the French Left of the 60s and, by implication, of Leftists, Radicals, Socialists, and Communists, in general. Viewing this film, you quickly realize why 'French Intellectual' is an oxymoron. Can you say 'pseudo-intellectual'? Theo's fawning admiration of Mao Tse Tung (large wall posters adorn the walls), arguably the greatest mass murderer in history, and spawner of the brutal insanity of the so-called 'Cultural Revolution', is but one example of the skewed, simplistic, and oh-so-wrong values of the Left.
Left (pun intended) to their own devices by parents whose largess they loathe (biting the hand that feeds you?), Theo and Isabelle and their new American friend Matthew indulge in an orgy of sexual debauchery (not hard-core, but very close, including one bloody scene that is definitely not for the squeamish) while skewering, among many easy targets of the Left, the Vietnam War, and waxing poetic about great films of the past. 'How many angels can stand on the head of a pin?' aside: Does anyone here work for a living? Not on your life! Quite literally eating themselves out of house and home (While the cats are away...), these brainless, hedonistic mice end up picking through the garbage (really!) for scraps, before finding an over-ripe banana they manage to split three ways.
This version is rated NC-17 and rightly so for, among other things, closeups of male and female genitalia). The latest Bond girl Eva Green IS spectacular in all her anatomical glory, and the acting all-around is superb. Highly recommended, though not for the reasons you might imagine.
Question: Did Bertolucci REALLY intend for his film to so spot-on expose the crassness, emptiness, selfishness, stupidity, moral turpitude, and overarching hypocrisy of the Left? If this isn't satire, it's certainly one of the finest example of serendipity in the history of filmdom.",1231891200,7,2022,5.205521472392638

Attracted to them first by a shared interest in the cinema, Matthew is soon drawn into the twins' incestuous relationship. To gain a full appreciation of the movie, including its historical background (set in the 1960's at the time of the student riots in Paris, and related to events in the French film industry at that time), I would recommend watching the excellent special features first.  On the other hand, if you are just looking for a wonderful sensual experience, you'll get that, too, in some great nude scenes featuring the beautiful Mlle Green.

Much of the story didn't really make a whole lot of sense, and the relationship between the brother and sister is really never fleshed out.  But, oh, my, to spend much of the movie viewing Eva Green disrobed is, well, worth the price of the dvd.",1219968000,3,413,4.407894736842105
2059858,4,B00023P4HY,"Ah, NC-17. Possibly one of the dumber ratings out there. The concept is great! Tag movies, like this, that aren't made for kids but are for an adult audience, with a rating that keeps kids away. In principle this is great! In execution, it's been deeply flawed. Newspapers won't advertise films with this rating, most reviewers won't review them, and studios won't generally allow them to be released. It's to the credit of Fox that they allowed this rather nice little movie to be put out uncut (though one of the male leads isn't... ha! Penis joke!).

The story concerns an American in Paris, played by Michael ""Drop-pants Gorgeous"" Pitt. He's a student visiting there who falls in with a twin brother/sister pair who love movies as much as he does. The twins aren't quite incestual, but they're as close as anyone can get.

The movie is something of a love-note to cinema. You see clips from a lot of the greatest movies of the early days of film, and get to see the kids recreate several of the scenes for their own (occasionally erotic), amusement. The movie also expertly highlights Paris in the late 1960's, giving you a real feel for the time and place and for what was going on.

Where the film fails... well, it doesn't fail in any real big ways. I gave it four stars because it felt like something was missing, though I couldn't put my finger on what (part of it is that the two male leads have an obvious simmering attraction to each other that doesn't get acted upon in the movie. I understand it does in the book the film is based on). There wasn't anything bad or wrong about the movie, but something did seem to be missing.

One thing that isn't missing, though, is acres of bare flesh. If you're one of those who doesn't like to see close-ups of penises and vaginas, then this likely isn't the film for you.

I'd actually recommend this movie for just about anyone over the age of 13 or so, provided you're a parent who doesn't mind your kids seeing a movie with lots of sexuality but no violence. If you'd prefer it the other way around, perhaps you need to rethink your priorities.

I haven't seen many other Bertolucci films, so I can't really compare them to this one. I know I liked it, though, and it's worth owning on DVD.",1217721600,6,2246,4.465853658536585

The myriad movie references.  A salute to vintage film.  Lovely.  Dreamy.  It will say what it wants to say to you.  For more to that end, you can easily check out a thoughtful review by Roger Ebert.

2059861,3,B00023P4HY,"I wouldn't say this movie is a bad film, but afterward you won't gain any food for thought from it. The two stars of the film are Eva Green's boobs. For the ladies, there's dongs hanging out quite a bit. Basically, the movie is about nudity, and three young characters trying to appear just likable and jolly enough to hide the fact they're in a softcore movie, with a few boundry pushing moments (that won't be that shocking to mature adults in this day and age I would think.) I'm not trying to be mean, but despite the great music, taboo subjects, and 60's counter-culture, everything about the plot is pretty much dull and cut'n'paste version of those things. Oh yeah, the characters are film buffs too, which really leads to cut'n'paste, as moments from their favorite films are sprinkled in the movie. So overall, I felt the whole story was ineffective, and the structure of the film ends up what I guess you could call ""cute."" The atmosphere and candid spirit of sexual adventure are what take a film that can't find anything to say and at least make it a comfortable trip. The question is, is that enough to make it a great movie, or is this a great cop-out that shouldn't think itself any greater than a skinemax late night movie? That's what I'm still wondering, and believe me I'd prefer the film had raised more substantial questions than that.",1213056000,2,1356,4.584362139917696

2059863,3,B00023P4HY,"Matthew (Michael Pitt) is a young American student who is studying in Paris. He spends his days and nights at the Cinematheque where a large number of film buffs gather to watch the latest films from all over the world. Matthew notices two people always in the audience like himself but doesn't have the courage to introduce himself. One day during a protest in front of the theater which has now been shut down by the government he befriends the girl Isabelle (Eva Green) and her brother Theo (Louis Garrel). They have noticed him too and wonder about him. They invite him over to dinner to meet their folks and then when the folks leave in the morning for a month abroad they invite him to move in with them. Matthew is shocked by not only how eager they are to invite someone they don't even know to live with them but also by a discovery he made in the middle of the night: Theo and Isabelle lying nude in the same bed together. However the lure of Isabelle is too hard to resist so Matthew moves in with the incestuous siblings and the three spend their days debating movies and playing games with each other that start off in good fun but turn sexual. Matthew reveals that he is a pacifist and that he doesn't agree with the violence that is taking place outside of the apartment which greatly contrasts with Theo who believes in revolution and quotes Mao regularly. Soon with Theo as instigator and Isabelle a willing participant Matthew is drawn into their sexual games. This comprises a third of the movie and there is nothing wrong with the sex and nudity since Eva Green is not only very attractive but has an unbelievable body but the problem is that nothing of consequence happens until the film's last act. It is only when the riots outside literally shatters their revel in the apartment that the three must take sides and take action. Michael Pitt despite being an odd looking version of Leonardo DiCaprio is a very good actor and his final look at the siblings at the end of the film is devastating. Matthew tries to convince the siblings that they can't live like this playing these kind of games with each other that they need to let each other go in order to grow up. Isabelle doesn't provide any sort of resistance to either man Matthew or her brother she loves them both. Theo is the most volatile of the group as he quickly becomes tired of Matthew sleeping with Isabelle but is more angered by his pacifist views. The film is a nice tribute to youth and the sixties which is what Bertolucci was hoping to make but the actual consequence and the three characters having to deal with the political revolution taking place around them comes too late. The DVD has a commentary track by Bertolucci as well as the screenwriter and producer, a very good hour long making of shot by the BBC which shows the serious intentions of everyone making the film and how hard of a director Bertolucci was on his cast, and there is also a thirteen minute doc on the events of 68 which are recreated for the film. Lastly are two trailers and a music video of Michael Pitt and the amusingly named Twins of Evil doing a cover of Hey Joe which is used in the film. Its a good movie with some good performances and some fantastic nude scenes but the serious intentions to educate the audience about the political landscape of Paris in 68 is not handled well.",1208995200,3,3359,4.481239804241436
2059864,5,B00023P4HY,"This gloriously liberated movie is a tough one to describe, and if you've seen it, you know what I mean. And please do see it uncut. It's just ridiculous to do otherwise because you'll lose much more than a few nude scenes, you'll lose its fearless magic.

As the fortieth anniversary of France's 1968 riots arrives, Bernardo Bertolucci's impressive but oft overlooked 2003 opus, The Dreamers, is suddenly at the fore of films which commemorate an explosive moment in modern European history of which few Americans are even aware. It is as if it took half a decade for the world to catch up with this a work of startlingly immodest originality, and find a place for it. With its near constant full frontal nudity, male and female alike, its non-erotic, non-pornographic, extremely realistic depictions of sex, its physically beautiful cast, its homage to films of the cinematic Golden Age, The Dreamers is a motion picture as vaguely disturbing as it is freakishly endearing, as frankly sexual as it is slightly dopey, as limited in its ability to display its inner imaginings as it is uninhibited in its capacity to aim unabashedly high in its artistic ambitions.

Set in Paris in 1968, mostly in a slightly decayed yet opulent flat populated by parentally unchaperoned, semi-incestuous post-adolescent twins (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) and their American guest, The Dreamers quietly presents itself sans apologies, and is soon revealed as a long, faintly claustrophobic tale of sex and mind games among members of a love triangle: a misplaced American loner traveling in France, and two native-born siblings whose obvious ennui is raw material for the shockingly sick games they undertake with one another. While somehow innocent, even sylph-like, the twins, Theo and Isabelle, compel each other and their American guest, Matthew (Dawson's Creek's Michael Pitt) to carry out depraved yet apparently consequence-free acts upon themselves and each other. Citing shared radical politics and an ardent love of film (a medium whose sheer otherwordly unreality mirrors the twins' own lives),  the trio bond as soul mates and play at fantasy inside their sheltered realm, even as outside riots rage and sudden poverty forces them to dine on other people's refuse. Nothing seems capable of infusing reality into the twins self-created little universe, though at times Matthew breaks free of the spell long enough to try, as when he asks Isabelle, long-since his lover, out on her first date.

2059868,4,B00023P4HY,"Matthew is a mellow, 20-year old student who happens to love movies.  It's 1968 and he's studying French abroad in Paris, and he's about to have the most insane few months of his life.

During the era that Matthew is in Paris, a famous film revolutionary named Henry Langlois is shutdown by the government or fired in some way.  It's just one part of Matthew's life, but it happens to coincide with his true love: cinema.  During his many visits to the movies, he happens to see most of the same film-buffs over and over.  It is amongst this counter-culture of film-buffs where he meets twin brother and sister, Theo and Isabell, a pair of fellow film lovers.

Matthew is sort of like a lame, film-savant of some kind, similar to Russell Crowe's character in A Beautiful Mind, except he has a intense desire to urinate in sinks and Russell Crowe never did that (not even in the deleted scenes).  It turns out that he's quite odd, noticing pointless details about random objects, and generally putting off a creepy vibe.  On the other hand, he's nowhere near as odd as his two new friends.

First of all, Matthew learns that Theo and Isabell, who, once again, are siblings, like to sleep naked with one another.  In between pretentious debates about actors and old movies (and some contrived Vietnam and Mao references), they also seem to enjoy a sado-masochistic, incestuously Freudian version of truth or dare, where the dares grow increasingly perverse and risque with each challenge.  Let's put it this way...menstrual blood is used often enough that all three are as comfortable with it as a menage a trois of scuba divers are surrounding water.

Just like the movie, which leaves a viewer completely baffled from beginning to end, I have no clue how to end this review, except to say that in some jaw-droppingly bizarre way, I think I liked The Dreamers, but thought the end was a little lacking.",1204848000,3,1901,4.709969788519637

I have been collecting Spanish and Mexican films for years, particularly Almoldovar's films. This was my first French film, or should I say Italian film.  Bertolucci is Italian, but the film is based on French life and a day in France's history. That's neither here nor there, I guess.

I love the openness of the three main characters. I am not bothered by the hint of incest.  I think your mind can either take you there or not.  The viewer is allowed to decide where the line needs to be drawn.  Life is complicated and I liked the complexity of this movie.  I have lost count of how many times I've watched it.  I love the music.  I love the added features. For me, they were essential to understanding the time period. I loved the mix of old clips and new recreated clips using the same historical figures. The music alone is worth watching the movie, let alone all the references to classic movies.

2059871,2,B00023P4HY,"The Dreamers (Bernardo Bertolucci, 2003)

I have to say, the more I watch Bernardo Bertolucci's films, the less I understand the seemingly universal accolades for his talent. Yeah, they're okay, I haven't found myself actively hating one. But they have never struck me as being great. The Dreamers is the latest example of this.

The story concerns Matthew (Bully's Michael Pitt), an American student in Paris in 1968, who befriends a brother and sister, Isabelle (The Golden Compass' Eva Green in her film debut) and Theo (Inside Paris' Louis Garrel). Before long, the three of them are living together in Isabelle and Theo's house, increasingly drawing away from the world as they get lost in one another, while outside, Paris is on the brink of a revolution.

The story itself is fantastic; it's the way Bertolucci plays it out that bugs me. The flick is riddled with capital-S symbolism that's about as subtle as a hammerblow to the face. Yeah, the three of them in a bath, each reflected in a different mirror. Could we be any less subtle? (And, for that matter, hasn't that trope been clich&eacute; for at least a couple of decades now?) That's only one example; you can find them throughout the movie. Bertolucci, working from Gilbert Adair's adaptation of his own novel, had an amazing canvas to work with here, but it seems phoned in. The characters' obsession with film is a great jumping-off point for a meditation on how retreating into a fantasy life can ultimately be even more harmful than the real world, but all the meditation there is to be found is in the script; the visual presentation just doesn't match up. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems a good number of directors could have handled this better.

All that said, it's a very pretty film, and the acting by the principals is everything it should be. Eva Green is breathtaking, both in the sense that she's beautiful and in the sense that Isabelle is the character who's farthest into a fantasy world, and thus has the farthest to fall when reality comes crashing in. Michael Pitt pulls off the mix of naivete and cynicism his character demands. Garrel, though, is the real find here; he seems at first to be sleepwalking through his role, but there's a great deal under the surface that comes out once we've gotten to know Theo a bit better, and Garrel makes Theo into the most vital of the characters by the end of the film. The Dreamers had the potential to be a truly amazing work of art; much of that potential is lost in Bertolucci's lack of artistry. **",1201564800,4,2530,4.678651685393258
2059872,5,B00023P4HY,"A near-great movie for 6.50? Who would pass that up?

I loved all the sex scenes (but only as a voyeur), and no, it is not a ""virtually"" incestuous relationship--it is an incestuous relationship.
I think my favorite scene is when the twins' parents arrive unexpectedly, and all three young people are sleeping in a happy naked pile in the tent they've set up in the livingroom (probably because their sheets are to dirty to use--in addition to the fact that sleeping in tents is fun). The parents look with horror at the way their house has been trashed, discover that their childrens' morals are ditto, and then one of them writes a check for them, and puts it under a candle on the table (which is then blown out). The wife starts pulling on her husband's sleeve, and when he looks indignantly at her, she says ""Did you want to stay for dinner?""

But: what I liked best about this movie is that the American is right about everything! Jimmy Hendrix is better than Eric Clapton, Chaplain is better than Keaton, Mao is not a very creative or humane way to go, all wars are for shit, and breaking and burning other people's property in the streets of Paris isn't going to make anyone agree with you....and incest, although it may be fun, will eventually ""make you forget your friends, homework, to fall in love and to brush your teeth."" (quote from me in..a story I, um, can't publish). Anyway, usually, the Americans are WRONG about everything. How refreshing!

As always, Bertolucci is very beautiful.",1199318400,9,1502,4.639097744360902
2059873,3,B00023P4HY,"First this flicka started slow, then it somewhat draws you in, maybe simply because you are watchin it.  Twill be viewed twine, but likely not a third time.  For it's price it was entertaining.  NPC",1196294400,,198,4.6
2059874,3,B00023P4HY,"I can honestly say I've never been more torn about a movie before. I'll freely admit I saw it based on: ""Twins play sex games with American student in 1968 Paris."" Uncut NC-17 led me to believe there was good sex, sensuality. Not in this movie. There's a lot of full frontal nudity, male and female. Did I say a lot? There is some sex and a particularly graphic scene, in fact. But none of it is sexy. None of it will give you that little twinkle in your eye. All the sex, all the nudity, all the sounds of sex (lots of those too), are part of the flow of the story ... a means to an end.

  The background was a bit confusing. The three meet and get together because they have an obsessive interest in cinema and are protesting the ouster of France's Cinematic Director. That sets in motion (eventually) the [Anarchist/Worker] uprising of May 1968. Don't expect more about that, though, it's touched on at the beginning and then you get another 5 minutes at the end.

  There really isn't much story. I figure they cut half the movie out for ""varied"" reasons and put the other half on the screen. Maybe to save it from an ""X"" rating? I can't figure it out. Sorry if I'm spoiling something here, but I think the gist is fairly obvious: incestuous twins bring in american boy to [assuage guilt, have fun with, etc]. The [assuage guilt, have fun with, etc] should have been the plot. It was never given the chance.

  There was the girl/guy relationship -- allowed to play out. There was also supposed to be a guy/guy relationship (read about some of it - too risqu) AND an incestuous relationship. That relationship did NOT exist in this movie. Psychologically, yes, but never really physically consummated. There is one scene where they hold each other topless while asleep. No other physical contact is had. At the end a feeble attempt is made to make us believe there was such a relationship, but passing out facing one way with all clothes on ... fade to black ... waking up naked with bodies askew - when no such act has even been intimated throughout the entire movie - is a little much to believe. This one scene has the weight of the movie on it. One scene to make you believe everything you'd seen up to that point was unimportant? Come on.

  Had we been allowed to concentrate on the true dilemma, I think this movie would have been the ultimate.

  Why three stars? Because I didn't move the entire time. Not once. I was completely and totally captivated. Every piece of this move - every action, every piece of scenery, costume, etc., all of it was so precisely  placed it was unbelievable. When the movie ended I felt like I had been played for a fool. I wanted to scream, ""Hey, I want my 2 hours back!"" (or at least give me a better ending.) Then it occurred to me that I truly had been entranced. So that's why the three stars. It's been a very long time since I didn't look at my watch or go get something to drink or hit pause for one reason or another during a movie.",1195862400,3,2985,4.3610108303249095
2059875,2,B00023P4HY,"Bertolucci is my favorite film director. No doubt others would disagree - if so, this is perfectly understandable because he is a flawed director with as many failures as spectacular successes. This is one of them. I don't understand the magic of artistic perfection any more than I can explain artistic failure, but one thing I'd venture is that nostalgia is a dangerous subject. Bertolucci is a great romantic, a man whose vision springs from his essential belief in the perfectibility of man. Stripped of any ideas other than nostalgia, the 60s haven't much to offer beyond what the director gives us, namely, chic porn. The film desperately seeks to shock with nudity and sex, incest, and the rest. Finally, we are as bored as the characters in a dull, pointless indulgence of self-consciousness. I was embarrassed for the great master as much as anything. I also felt that the 60s had finally hit bottom, having floated for years above the dregs of its sordid past, only to fall flat finally weighted down as it was with sex, drugs and self-importance. Bertolucci has a hard time connecting the glory years of the student revolution with anything in history; its ties to any revolutionary tradition proved long ago to be tenuous. It was after all is said and done just a panties-raid, as shown by its veterans whose lives now resemble more closely those of Marie Antoinette's Court than those of Jean-Jacque Rousseau's circle.

Paris is beautiful, the cast is beautiful, the dialauge is beautiful, and not to mention witty and intelligent.
  Matthew(Michael Pitt)is a wide eyed, slightly shy, charming young man who meets Isabelle(Eva Green) and Theo(Louis Garrell) purely by happenstance. Isabelle has mock chained herself to the gates of the cinamatique(the movie theater housed inside a palace) as a riot about the theater is going on outside. She and Matthew immidetly strike up a conversation and when her brother Theo happens along after speaking to the lead rioter, a noticable spark is ignited between the three of them. Within the course of the next few days he has dinner with them, spends the night at their house and then eventually moves in because of the invitation issued to him by Izzy and Theo.  The first night he spends there he walks by Theos room and sees them naked in bed together, asleep. He is shocked and confused, as you can tell by the look on his face, but he says nothing about it the next day. Other odd behaviours arise from the Izzy and Theo, such as Izzy licking the sleep out of Matthews eyes, them tag teaming matthew while trying to shave off Matthews pubic hair, and Izzy making Theo jack off in front of them after losing a game. Most people would be repelled by their strangeness, but some how, for some reason, Matthew is drawn to it like a moth to a flame.  We find out later that there is a sort of reason behind the Izzy and Theos  closeness, the reason being that they are siamese twins.

2059880,5,B00023P4HY,"I loved this movie! It is so packed with forbidden eroticism that it goes beyond taboo! But, it is not a bad kind of taboo.

The story centers around a young American film student studying in France.  He doesn't have many friends, until one day he meets a beautiful girl at a rally and her off-standish brother.  The siblings take the young American under their wing and eventually he moves in with them.  It is during this time that he sees how ""different"" the siblings are.

During a late night bathroom run, he catches a glimpse of the brother and sister lying in the same bed nude.  If you are schocked by this first erotic scene then you should definitley not watch the rest of the movie because it definitley doesn't get any milder.  Although the plot is less than developed, the viewer is completely sucked in to the lives of the three major characters.

Though the siblings are weird and do things that normal brothers and sisters would never DREAM of doing, there is something extremeley natural and normal about it.  As if seeing each other nude and during sexual acts is as normal as sharing a meal at the family dinner table.  They portray the classic taboo of incest in a classy manner, if that is even possible.

I didn't think that I would like American actor Michael Pitt because he looked like an American actor who would be too aware of his eyes and lips but I quickly learned why he was the director's choice.  His American is neither callow nor thoughtless about his fortunate friendship with Theo and Isabelle and the actor does not indulge in any poses.

I hope that the young actors don't feel bad about the silly media focus on the nudity.  It's not like those psychedelic movies with hippies doing gymnastics naked.

As an alternate, see my review, as well as this Amazon review by Bret Fetzer below mine.

Many would attempt judging this film as kinky with a sprinkling of frontal nudity and a menage a' trois scene thrown in (the NC-17) version. However, this Bernardo Bertolucci film would rather like to remembered as a love letter to the movies and to the average Parisian's intense love for good films. Using a backdrop of the 1968 student riots brought about by the firing of the director at the Cinematheque Francais - a temple for students and afficionados of art films, the story weaves into it the coming-of-age story of a bother-sister par and a young exchange student from America living together duing the heady days, and their evolving relationship.
-------------------------------
""A love letter to movies (and the French new wave of the 1960s in particular), Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers starts with a 1968 riot outside of a Parisian movie palace then burrows into an insular love triangle. Matthew (Michael Pitt, Hedwig and the Angry Inch), an expatriate American student, bonds with a twin brother and sister, Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), over their mutual love of film--they not only quote lines of dialogue, they act out small bits and challenge each other to name the cinematic source. Matthew suspects the twins of incest, but that doesn't stop him from falling into his own intimacies with Isabelle. As the threesome becomes threatened, Paris succumbs to student riots. The Dreamers aspires to be kinky, but the results are more decorative than decadent; nonetheless, the movie's lively energy recalls the careless and vital exuberance of Godard and Truffaut"". --Bret Fetzer

In this film, Bertolucci returns to Paris of 1968. His First Tango is as shocking as Last one - it received NC-17 rating for very open scenes of nudity, masturbation, sex, and the hints to incest. But it is not just about sex - it is about film itself. It was the time when Pauline Kael said, ""Bertolucci and Brando have altered the face of an art form"". It was the time when a crowd in Chicago would line up under umbrellas on the sidewalk, waiting in the rain to get into the next screening of Godard's ""Weekend."" It was the time when movie makers became the Artists. It was the time when closing down of the famous Cinematheque Francais in Paris by the government started the student culture riots which became the part of youthful rebellion all over the Western World.

Young American, Mathew, a devoted movie buff (Michael Pitt who by the opinion of several reviewers looks like cross between Leo DiCaprio and Macaulay Culkin. I found him looking more like young Roger Ebert would've. ) becomes friends with two French students and fellow movie lovers, twins Isabella (Eva Green, in a star making debut) and Theo (Louis Garrel) and accepts their invitation to stay with them at their apartment while their intellectual parents are away for vacation.

All three are big fans of movies - they not only talk about movies, they live their favorite scenes. ""The Dreamers"" is Bertolucci's love letter to cinema, and his irony toward people taking it so seriously that the real world is ignored.

When Matthew moves in with the twins, the result closely resembles ""Last Tango in Paris"". Much of the film's second half occurs in that apartment, as insular as Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider's more than thirty years ago. Flirting becomes passion becomes dark and dangerous games to see how far someone will go. The difference is that the kids of ""The Dreamers"" are not as complicated and interesting as Paul or Jeanne (especially Paul, one of the greatest performances by genius Brando).

With this wistful ode to sex, cinema, and the heated atmosphere of the '60s, Bertolucci has proved that he is still on the top of his game. I will be happily waiting for his next film.",1177545600,12,2408,4.696682464454977

Bertolucci's work is deeply political ... and, yes, beautifully sensual. There is no need to rehash the plot, you can find it in the other reviews. Instead, allow me to sway you into giving this film a whirl. 1.) The cinematography is gorgeous. The color, the framing, the mise en scene ... candy for the eye. 2.) The soundtrack is pitch-perfect ... it expertly highlights the content. 3.) The gripping plot unfolds with a delicious langour ... very nearly teasing the audience. And the idea of ""private"" and ""public"" being kept separate and ultimately colliding is surprisingly effective.  ****Spoiler: move to the next paragraph if you have not seen the film**** That the trio is rescued from death by the revolution spilling into their living-room is a particularly haunting concept.

As far as themes are concerned, watch for Bertolucci's use of mirrors. Note where they are split into threes ... and where they are merely divided in half. Watch how they underscore the status of the trio's relationship.

Bertolucci's film embraces cinephiles. References to Browning's ""Freaks"" (1932), Sternberg's ""Blond Venus"" (1932), and Hawks ""Scarface"" (1932) abound (and that's just the beginning). Sometimes referenced outright and sometimes cut into scenes (creating a mirroring effect), classic film awaits your discovery ... a bit like a quiz for those in the ""know"";) (And, yes, the repetition of ""1932"" is interesting since it was the beginning of the French Depression).

Of the rating, Roger Ebert (of the Chicago Sun-Times) states: ""The movie is rated NC-17, for adults only, because of the themes and because of some frontal nudity. So discredited is the NC-17 rating that Fox Searchlight at first thought to edit the film for an R, but why bother to distribute a Bertolucci film except in the form he made it? The sexual content evokes that time and place. The movie is like a classic argument for an A rating, between the R and NC-17, which would identify movies intended for adults but not actually pornographic.

2059909,4,B00023P4HY,"One of 2003's most provocative and controversial films that most no one has seen, `The Dreamers' is the type of movie you hate to love.  It's full of faux political messages and odes to the movies of the 60's and French revolution wrapped in illicit sexual content, graphic nudity and incestuous overtones.  While at times I think this film has trouble deciding what it wants to be, does it want to be a smart and intellectual character study, an adult film or a political drama, but aside from the sudden bits of confusion `The Dreamers' still attains a certain sense of self awareness.  It's a confident film and it's because of that confidence that the viewer is forced to keep watching.

Young Californian Matthew (Michael Pitt) has just moved to France and is living in a shabby apartment.  He soon meets and becomes close to twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) whose relationship borders on the unconventional.  When the twins parents leave them alone for the month they invite Matthew to live with them and soon, very soon, he's been thrown into their games, from acting out famous scenes in movies to `forfeiting' (wait till you find out what that means).  Matthew, while at first repulsed eventually Matthew becomes intrigued and joins in with their games.  His relationship with Isabelle starts to tear the three of them apart, especially driving a wedge between the twins.

Michael Pitt gives Matthew a very restrained and curious appearance, a very natural and expected reaction to his surroundings, and Louis Garrel plays the jealous brother/lover almost precisely, but it's Eva Green who steals the show with her blatant sexuality and unique confidence in her character.  As Isabelle, Green shows more maturity than her male co-stars and earns herself a spot in my most talented newcomers.  I tend to enjoy `The Dreamers' a little more when they stick to their guns and keep the physical relationships between the three the prime focus of attention, for they begin to lose me when they engage in riots and scream through the streets.

It's not the best movie of 2003 but it's one of the more unique and challenging and definitely would break my top 20.",1165363200,7,2181,4.864864864864865

This is a movie about one young American who enters the bohemian-like world of native Parisians who are sister and brother. They share an interest in film, but the young American soon is faced with moral conflicts that ultimately lead him to a boundary he will not cross.

2059912,3,B00023P4HY,"Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"" takes place in 1968 during the street protests in Paris.  Its protagonist is Matthew (Michael Pitt), an American student living in Paris for a year.  He's an ardent cinephile and spends much of his time watching films at the fabled Cinematheque Francaise.  While at a protest there he meets and begins a friendship with twin brother and sister twins Theo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green) - a friendship that turns out to be more than he expected.

""The Dreamers"" has drawn a lot of notoriety from the great amount of sex and nudity that gave the film an NC-17 rating.  While I had no problem with this, I did feel somewhat dissatisfied after I finished watching the film.  Bertolucci and writer Gilbert Adair, in the accompanying documentaries, talk about making a film about the protests, but I never quite felt that the idea of the protesters meshed well with the three main characters sequestered away inside their rambling Paris apartment.  I feel that the story of the protests needed to be given either more significance or less, rather than the uneasy balance that Bertolucci achieved.

That's not to say that the situation in the outside world is not talked about.  Matthew and Theo are on opposite sides of the coin politically.  Theo believes in the supposed non-violence of China's Cultural Revolution as compared to the bloodshed going on in Vietnam, while Matthew tells him of the folly of a country where everyone reads one little red book and nothing more.  Theo talks a lot about change but Matthew reminds him that while people are out marching in the streets, he (Theo) is lying around drinking wine and doing nothing.  When Theo finally does take action, his non-violent outlook suddenly disappears.

The real heart of the story is the relationship between the three characters.  Isabelle and Theo play out sexual games bordering on incest behind their parents backs, and when mom and dad head out to the countryside for a month, Matthew is (unknowingly to him) brought to join in.  He goes along with it (if unwillingly at first), but then has enough and tells them to grow up and realize that they're two different people who should lead two different lives.  My heart cheered when Matthew convinced Isabelle to go out on a date with him alone, but it sank when later that evening she got upset to find Theo with another girl and showed that she is still bound to him.  When Theo goes off to commit his act of violence, Matthew tries to convince Isabelle to stay behind, but she can't - not because she believes in violence, but because she simply cannot break away from her brother.

At first I thought that Michael Pitt was a little bland as Matthew, but then I realized that he was giving an understated performance as the observer of what was going on around him and, to some extent, the voice of reason in the group.  Eva Green is very alluring as Isabelle - though I wouldn't call her a classic screen beauty, she does possess a beautiful figure (which the audience gets to see in detail, quite literally, from head to toe) and is very sexy, even with her clothes on.  While I found these two characters to be likeable, I never quite warmed up to Theo.  While well played by Louis Garrel, I basically thought that Theo was an idiot.  While some may say that this was a result of his youth, Matthew and his ideals show that this doesn't need to be so.

The film is presented on DVD in a 1.85:1 ratio, enhanced for widescreen sets.  The visuals are beautiful - I've always liked films set in Paris - and the DVD transfer looks good.  Some visual highlights include a run through the Louvre (recreating a scene in a famous French film), a walk through the corridors of Theo and Isabelle's apartment revealing what an amazing place it is, and (best of all) a recreation of the Venus de Milo in living flesh, with Eva Green looking absolutely stunning as the goddess of love and beauty - surely one of the most arresting single film images I have ever seen.

Lastly, the film didn't so much end as come to a stop.  I wanted to see more - which means that it did hold my interest to some extent.  However, ""The Dreamers"" doesn't come close to a film like ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" - a masterpiece which also dealt with a sexual triangle of friends set against the backdrop of political turmoil in post-WW 2 Europe.  Still, it is worth a look (and for Eva Green fans, I guess it's a must see).",1162684800,3,4467,4.60479797979798

2059918,5,B00023P4HY,"I absolutely adore this film.  Bertolucci is one of the great filmmakers working today.  It was wonderful to see a film that treated sex and nudity (both male and female, at least in the NC-17 version) with respect and maturity, as opposed to the snickering of a Farrelly Brothers film or a Sex and the City episode.  The actors seemed very at ease with it, as Bertolucci has made some of the greatest erotic films of all time (even though Jake Gyllenhaal was up for the Michael Pitt part, but turned it down because he didn't want to appear full frontal nude...chicken).  The passion of those times is well conveyed here, and the clips from the great films are wonderful (especially if you're a cinephile, like myself).  There was a time in the world where people felt passionately about art, politics, cinema, life, sex, everything, and that passion seems to be lacking today.  It is nice to see a director (Catherine Breillat does this as well) who is unafraid of showing sex, and showing it to be natural and real, as opposed to having to put cheap sex jokes in there so we don't feel uncomfortable.  A masterpiece...",1149897600,16,1121,4.6313131313131315
2059919,4,B00023P4HY,"This film is very good, I was surprized at how much I liked it considering all the media reviews around its release which emphasized incest and nudity and sexual taboos.  In fact, the film is really about the social construction of reality and the testing of your constructed reality model. Let me explain what I mean by this; a pair of beautiful twins, a brother and sister, have developed a passion for film and have developed a highly dependent relationship upon each other that focuses their erotic energies toward each other in their insular world rather than outward. They have constructed an odd reality system, but for them it seems to have worked. They interprete the world through film. The first weakening of this reality system begins when the twins, Isabelle and Theo, invite Matthew into their world. Their parents leave for a month long summer vacation and Matthew moves into their lush apartment.

There is a very telling and important scene where Matthew comes to dinner with the family and the father and Theo have an argument at the table. Theo is angry and full of adolescent rage at his father, but his father is saddened to see Theo full of anger and so empty of real experience. Theo's view of reality is distorted and his sad father realizes that he can't help his son, that only pain and experience will open his eyes. Theo and Isabella have no idea how pampered they really are. Matthew sees it immediately but is gradually seduced by the beautiful and sophisticated twins.

Matthew is the first crack in the wall of their world. He moves into the apartment and they play games around famous films. Isabelle seduces Matthew, who is her first love, while Theo watches and so begins a marathon of love making all over the house from which Theo gradually withdraws. Theo then makes love to a girl in his college class, which is just the trick to stir Isabelle's insecurity, jealousy, and dependency needs. She quickly pulls Theo back into the threesome orbit.

These three young people are consumers, they are not producers, they run out of food and money and eventually drink a lot of the father's wine collection. Matthew, through his genuine love for Isabelle, trys to insert an external reality into their world, but both Theo and Isabelle resist. Around them the city of Paris is in riot yet the twins are oblivious. In a great scene, Isabelle and Theo wish to shave Matthew's pubic hair and he rebels and refuses confronting them with a desire to infantilize him, to make him their little boy - the childhood Theo loved by Isabelle, rather than accept that he loves Isabelle alone and wants out of the triangle.

The parents return because the phone line is dead and when the nude threesome are discovered, in a bedspread tent Isabelle recreates from her childhood, Isabelle decides to kill herself and the others using gas from the oven. This young woman will go to extremes to avoid letting the world enter her reality. To some degree she is the ultimate control freak in that she must control those around her to meet her needs and she does not allow any contrary vision of the real world to enter into her created childhood space. Matthew, though totally in love with her, realizes it is a lost cause. He realizes this when Isabelle and Theo are thrown into an on-going riot and begin acting like characters from a movie, with reckless abandonment as if they were immortal. He merges into the riot and disappears from their lives.

I loved the title, The Dreamers, for this exactly captures Theo and Isabelle's world. At least Matthew finally awoke. This is an underestimated film, it is very well done.",1146960000,135,3636,4.7271293375394325

2059921,3,B00023P4HY,"Matthew is a film student, quiet, intense, and voracious in his passion for classic movies. He's there, every night, taking in all that the cinematic undergound of 1968 Paris has to offer. Even though Matthew is private, even reclusive, other film buffs come to recognize him as one of the regulars. He catches the eye of one them, Isabel, who's at least as dedicated to the old movies as he is. With Isabel comes Theo, her twin brother. The three-way friendship builds around their shared love of film.

As he enters more deeply into that friendship, it takes odd turns. The twins play a never-ending game of forfeits, built around movie trivia, with a decidedly erotic edge. They make Matthew a part of the game as well. After initial shyness, he takes part fully. At that point, the threesome starts to fold in on itself.

The Viet Nam war looms large in the background, and the French riots of the 1960s. The activist spirit of the time, outwardly directed toward the social issues of the day, only highlights how self-involved the three become. They scarcely leave the house (or even dress), except to cash daddy's allowance check or to collect another bottle of wine. Toward the end, these lotus eaters do little more than cuddle like kittens, barely able to handle human tasks such as housekeeping.

Then the dream ends. It's as abrupt and destructive as an egg smashing. Maybe, without it, these grown children would never have moved out of their nest and toward the adult world.

The movie is slow at points, especially near the start. The physicality, though generally warm, has a confused edge - as if the players are children, cautiously testing the waters of adulthood. They seem horrified to find that, once they've put the first toe in the water, it can't come back out.

I did not expect much from it, bought it because I was intrigued by the reviews and I wanted to see the new Bond girl. Since I did not expect much I was relaxed into it and was caught up in the slow progress of the movie. This is not a quick hit in entertainment. It slowly builds using nudity to maybe pique the viewer's interest, but I do not think this is a film about nudity. In some respects parts of this movie are quite gross.

  That said the movie is only pleasant and interesting, not a movie where I could say ""I really enjoyed that"", and maybe that is not what was intended. Maybe the true value of this movie is it's very slowness, no rush to get anywhere and with a pleasant cast and scenery. I must say though that I could not identify with the plot, not being British or French. I think their mores are foreign to our understanding here in the US.

  Humorously, this morning I turned on the telly (I can use that term, I am married to a Brit!) and the news was showing Paris police quelling rioters, both sides using the same methods as were shown in the movie!

The opening credits tumble down against a steel background that makes you feel as if you're taking an elevator down the Eiffel Tower. You don't see many movies like this. ""The Dreamers"" is unashamedly erotic. But what's wrong with that? What else should we expect from the director of ""Last Tango in Paris?"" There's more sex here than in ""Last Tango,"" and Bertolucci shows that he has lightened up since that 1973 movie. ""Dreamers"" is very serious at times, but no one broods here the way Brando did. And unlike ""Last Tango,"" here we get a story of impossible love set against the backdrop of a larger struggle. Politics is important to this movie, but at its core, it involves a love triangle between a siamese brother and sister separated at birth and their American friend. The erotic center is Eva Green's character, Isabelle, who is about as gorgeous as actresses come. She bears the burden of being mother, sister, and lover. For a while, the film explores the ballet between Matthew and Isabelle that is not ended until brother Theo orders (permits?) them to make love in front of him. While he makes eggs. It made me think of the infamous food and sex scene in ""Last Tango,"" though here it is not mean-spirited in the way Brando's butter-topped rape of Maria Schneider was. ""The Dreamers"" is about the perils of first love as well as the love that is, or at least seems, permanent. The film is stronger when it focuses on the dreaming title characters and their hermetic world of movie trivia and pop culture arguments (such as, ""Who's better, Hendrix or Clapton?""). Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is contrived. Anyone who watched the first 100 minutes won't care much about the rioting in the streets. And Theo's politics are contradictory at best. He has a Mao Zedong poster, but has no qualms about sponging off his rich parents. The reality of the revolution doesn't really affect him until the last moments of the movie. But his conversion to the cause seems like an afterthought. For most of the movie, he happily drinks Chateau La Fitte while people are hurt in the streets. He hates his father in the bratty way many young adults dislike their parents, but he doesn't seem to have any real desire for social change. Maybe he is the typical romantic revolutionary: he wants something to happen, but doesn't know to what end. Rather than for the politics, watch this movie for its visual pleasures. Bertolucci sees everything as art, whether it is an old black and white movie, the backstreets of Paris, or the human body. Although many viewers will be repulsed by the film's incestuous theme, those with an open mind will squirm far less. Don't watch this one with your parents around, though. Isabelle and Theo engage in behaviors that would appall most people, but there's no actual sex involved.

The  main female character looks ageless.  According to the script, she's supposed to be college age, but she looks anywhere from 20 to 35.  Her ageless looks add to the impression of estrangement from her era and from reality in general.

The film centers on a trio of young cinephiles growing up in Paris in the late 1960's.  The Parisian brother and sister befriend the young American male based on a common love of great films.  In the era before home video, the threesome is limited to only the movies which are playing at the local cinema.

The adolescents are political activists and a huge contradiction in terms, since they are wanton consumers who do nothing but sit around and protest-war and have angst-ridden conversations while mooching off their parents.  The term ""activist"" is a bit generous for describing them, since their mouths were the most active things, and they never actually did anything progressive to change the world.

There is a three-way sexual relationship which is much more the focus of the film than the political machinations.  The brother and sister are obsessed with one another in a way that prevents them from forming healthy relationships with anyone outside the family.

Other than that, this seems (to me anyway) to be a typical Bertolucci movie.  Listening to the director's commentary, I found myself thinking ""Whoa there, Bernardo.

The tagline is 'Cinema, Sex, Politics.' The cinema is mostly sixties French, not my cup of tea, so that leaves the  politics and sex. This film probably has a nostalgic appeal to those who were inspired by Paris '68, but I was in nappies, so onto the sex.  The actress is hot, but in these mutlimedia days a naked woman is not the thrill it was when I was 15. I like films for their stories, and this one doesn't really work. The climax is very artificial, involving the return of parents who are estranged emotionally from their children, but the effect it has on the daughter is absurdly extreme. The acting is shabby, and all in all it comes off as an aging director using his clout to get sexual kicks on set.

I love foreing films and reading subtitles but this is fine too.

So, these french twin boy & girl and an american boy, who's there to study, meet in a movie theater. They quickly bond cuz all three are old movie fanatics. When the twins' parents leave town for a month they invite their new friend to stay with them as their mother sugested just before leaving. They get very sexual with eachother from there on while playing guessing games and daring each other to do ""stuff"".

 Meanwhile, out on the streets, riots are forming and getting worse, something to do with movie censorship or something. These riots actualy hapened but i've never heard of this before. So i'm greatful to this movie for enlightning me on this part of history.

Aside from the fact that this movie is so universally bad that I am yet to meet anyone that has found it worth watching (these friends are film buffs, as one might say) the movie also represents how pathetic mass-counter culture is.  Film has replaced progressive culture in frightening ways and contributed to the atomization of the individual in our society (a la Hegel and Marx).  People sit and stare at a screen with little interaction, except to hush someone who makes a comment during a film.  Then you see how pathetic these characters are ... they literally live their lives through a consciousness that cannot see hte world except through film scenes.  If anyone has read any Adorno, you will know what the dangers of this are ... not to mention how pathetic it is.  Yes, let film replace culture, let those who consider themselves progressive or liberal believe that the cure to our society's consumerism is to see their lives in terms of mass produced film scenes and to sit silently before a screen, ignorant to whether the people they are with are still in the room.  This is the state of community in our times ...  and culture as well.  Progressives criticize the turn away from the welfare state in our society, and then, instead of going out into civil society and engaging in politics and going to places where one finds genuine social interaction ... even at a bar with no televisions, instead, they sit home and watch movies with the same three people.  Then they pull out some trite postmodern postures, which are philosophically lacking any rigor or sophistication (read any of a variety of books, perhaps the most well-known, but not best, is Against Theory) to justify their inaction and stupidity.  Or what is worse, they watch television shows they know to be banal or rent movies of the most extreme stupidity and claim that they are really doing a cultural critique of them.  Why not just admit a horrible case of akrasia?  At least be honest with yourself?

2059953,3,B00023P4HY,"""We're shoting today and we're dreaming of the sixties"" - Bertolucci's comment in the documentary TV film ""Cinema, Sex, Politics"", David Thompson (dir.), BBC, 2003.

Bertolucci is an Italian director filming in Paris in French and English in 2003.  Despite this cross proper of European Union times, the movie is clearly American, with an exception .  Let me explain myself: the protagonist is a young American boy nineteen years old called Matthew.  We discover what is happening from his eyes, as if Matthew was in fact a young Roger Ebert or Jonathan Rosenbaum  in the days of May (Rosenbaum in fact reached Paris only in mid-June, but nevertheless became friends with Gilbert Adair, the author of the novel on which the movie is based).  Most of the movie is in English, being the French used only as a foreign language in French soil, making the use of subtitles unnecessary.  But there is a great deal of sex in the film (is a ""Bertolucci"" in the end) so it is distributed in the United States under the prohibitive NC-17 rating, reserved ordinarily only for pornography.  Under the guise of ""art"", this film is the closest American audiences can get to sex on the screen without feeling dirty in a wide distributed film.  An American director couldn't have pulled this off.  Probably the fact that Bertolucci is European allowed him to film the movie knowing that the American market would be open: strangers are allowed sometimes to trespass local red lines in the name of a supposedly exotic ""high art"".

""Nostalgia is highly selective, abridging the past and adjusting it to fit the terms of the present -- and often becoming an ideological con job in the process. Those who wax nostalgic about the radicalism of their youth usually imply that the values that made it so attractive back then also make it impossible to hold on to today"", notes Jonathan Rosenbaum , resuming in four lines the central thing to be said about ""The Dreamers"".  Nostalgia is the mode utilized by Bertolucci when looking at the past, even when is not for him because he was not in Paris at the moment but in Rome filming ""Partner"".

""Cinema, Sex, Politics"" is one of the film's taglines and is the one that defines the importance given to each element, with the first two competing with each other and the third one in a far place showing strongly only in the last minutes.
The May of this film starts in February when famous bunch of filmmakers and a lot of cin&eacute;philes showed up at the Cin&eacute;matique doors to ask for the restitution of Henri Langlois, the deposed Cin&eacute;matique director.  For the film (and also for Ebert, which should know better), this act of middle-class rebellion against an order from the administration is the origin of all which came later.  Class politics doesn't seem to be a part of it but cultural freedom and transgression it is.  This last concept is central for this version of history.  The young demonstrators in Bertolucci's world are transgressors that needed to cross the line of authority as a development need of their age.  The problem between the repressive forces of order and the young students is reduced as a generational gap that naturally occurs.  Workers, clearly, are not seen anywhere.  Bertolucci's view is close to the one of those ""repented"" leaders talking after twenty years about their `foolish' behavior on the streets of 1968.

Cinema: ""The Dreamers"" is full of quotations and homages to all kind of films, but the most impressive is to feature references to four Godard films being the exact political opposite.  ""a bout de souffl&eacute;""  is referenced as the birth date of Isabella (the beginning of the nouvelle vague), and a central sequence of ""Bande a part"" signals the moment when Matthew becomes part of the threesome, which is suggested but not explicitly showed: heterosexual sex is accepted, but the homosexual overtones of the original novel by Adair are censored.  Being the tension still present between Matthew and Theo, is understandable why no references to Truffaut's ""Jules et Jim"" are to be found.  ""La Chinoise"" appears only as a poster in Theo's room, in place with the rest of gauchiste references in the apartment.  It seems that political films are not to be included in the film buff games played by the trio, but only romantic scenes and one death (the one in ""Scarface""), this being understandable under the trio's desire to escape reality.  In this sense the film is being schizophrenic: in one side Matthew warns us at the beginning about the wish of protection from reality that offers the silver screen, but on the other all the political events are explained starting from the resistance to the removal of Mr. Langlois from the Cinemateque and his eventual restitution.  Events are compared with film.  The central political discussion to happen between Matthew and Theo starts from Theo's metaphor of Maoist ""cultural revolution"" as a blockbuster production with millions of participants, to what Matthew answers: ""yes, but everybody as extras"".  Matthew's critic to Maoism is not far from the totalitarian truth (""all the millions with only one book in their hands"") but his comment reveals a need for individual protagonists in history: the masses cannot in this view be important or desirable.

Sex: ""The Dreamers"" is overtly conservative in its sex politics.  Isabella seems to be sexually active, only to be discovered later that this attitude ""was only acting"".  Isabella is virgin and her first sexual act (with Matthew) is compared with a street manifestation.  Is Bertolucci saying that to manifest is the birth of a pleasurable and productive activity that hurts at the beginning?  I doubt so.  It seems that the painful part of the act is the only element considered for the metaphor.  Matthew considers all the sex games in which they indulge to be ""children behavior"", and later on he will relate this to political activism.  It is clear now that for Bertolucci the student's revolt is in fact child's play.  After some pseudo-explicit heterosexual sex we find the three characters in a single bath-tube to be scorned tight away by Matthew who enters into a fit of reproach towards Isabella and asks her on an American-like date.  The possibility of the non-existence of that kind of relationship between a men and a woman (""dating"") is promptly negated by Matthew: ""They have dates in France, don't you?"", being this phrase an almost culturally imperialistic assumption about custom in France .  The nostalgic touch intends to connect May 1968 with a supposed explosion in promiscuity not matched by reality: the movie comes closer to be Bertolucci's version of Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"".  At least it doesn't transform the Sorbonne into the orgy Louis Malle suggests in ""May Fools"", but limits the sexual activity to the apartment and disconnects it from what is happening outside (metaphor apart).  Rosenbaum again is helpful suggesting that the highlight in sex has more to do with the differences between American and French attitudes toward pleasure than to the politics of the day.  The same could have been filmed had Matthew traveled to Brazil or Thailand at the end of the 20th century (being the difference, and an important one, that Isabelle is white and ""European"").

Politics: After the demonstration in February at the Cin&eacute;matique, reality remains outside of the picture until the date scene.  Matthew and Isabella observe what is happening through a TV in a store window at night and a voice over (Matthew) informs us in a negative tone: ""they're not students anymore"", implying that the participants in May ""disturbances"" are not the genuine forces of youth who started it all in defense of cultural diversity (or more narrowly, the right to see all kind of films in a building in Paris).  After this they turn around and observe in awe an enormous pile of uncollected garbage reaching half the length of a post lamp. The garbage represents May exactly in the same way that a pile of shoes represents the Holocaust in Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"": is a banal reduction of a complex historical event to a single image devoid of human presence; it is in fact what remains of human activity after all what is important in an historical sense has terminated to happen.  The pile of garbage points to the disorderly nature of the events, only noted when thinking the number of options available to Bertolucci when choosing a representation: many other images could have been chosen, between them some more positive.
At the end of the film (the last five minutes) reality intrudes into the fantasy world of our three heroes.  The three go out of the apartment and doubling as our point of view the camera enters into the mass of demonstrators.  Demonstrations are seen on the screen directly, and Bertolucci makes sure none of us stays at the sidewalk.  We enter the manifestation and we are lost for a moment.  When Matthew sees the two brothers he asks of Isabella to put an end to all of the games, but Theo takes a Molotov cocktail and Isabella decides to join him.  Matthew presents a pacifist argument even when before he was defending the (poor) American soldiers in Vietnam .  ""A Molotov is fascism on a bottle"" is the key here.  It is that?  Theo throws the explosive cocktail, and his act seems on the screen not the result of his ideological convictions finally put into action (debunked before in the conversation about Maoism) but of jealously and immature behavior.  The American boy, Bertolucci and us abandon the two brothers at the middle of violence and retreat from history.  When the supposed realism of the historical Hollywood film menaces to bring History out of memory the effect of nostalgia finishes and thoughtful remarks about the past can arise.  Is precisely in this moment in which Bertolucci decides to end his account. At the beginning of the 21st Century, only nostalgia about the days when they were young is what the ""Baby Boomer"" generation -on the States and those who act like them- can allow themselves to record.

Times have changed.  Today no pavement stones remain on the popular neighborhoods of Paris.  To film the final demonstration scene, Bertolucci needed to ask permission to the rich inhabitants of one of the more exclusive arrondissements and wait for them to leave in the heat of August toward the beach.  In the international sphere, America has shown to be the government prepared to act violently at every moment, and France the one trying to appease the expansive drive of the empire.  On the Third World areas affected by this expansion, a new kind of popular resistance, many times more deadly and many times less ideologically backed is breeding and acting, hurting sometimes those who cannot defend themselves.  If Bertolucci asks for those who feel that the world is not right not to resist, why he doesn't do the same with the repressive and expansive activities of power?  Is he only interested in involving France and America in metaphoric love-making?  If there is such a thing as an esprit du mai, it has here been lost.",1130198400,11,11125,4.9044313934863855

From my point of view great parts of the film focuses on the relationship between the three characters which has the result that a great part of the ""real"" history has to be reduced.",1129161600,6,516,4.431578947368421

How deceived I was.

Not mentioning the utterly horrible packaging that tries to market it as some kind of third-rate ""Basic Instinct"" rip-off, the transfer quality of the movie to the dvd was horrible. The screen was constantly flickering with speckles with colorization that does no justice to the beautiful visuals of Cianchetti, and the sound was extremely muted and blurred that even at the full volume I had a hard time understanding some of the dialogues.

The extra features could be termed ""extremely insubstatial"" at best. The BBC documentary (again, with an utmostly unacceptable transfer quality) and the commentaries by Berolucci himself were the only ones that at least gave this demonic production some kind of value. Others? Just forget about them.

In conclusion, I highly discourage all of you from buying this DVD. There is a reason why Amazon offers an extremely high discount on this DVD. That is because this DVD just plain simply sucks, and does no justice to the great original film; and people know about this, unless they're one of the suckers like me who had no previous knowledge whatsoever about this horrible dvd and loved the original film.

Watching it, I was fond of its classical aura; it felt like an homage and also something wholly original. Only enhancing this quality are the interjections of classic cinema that are not simply tossed in but integrated seamlessly, uniquely, and often beautifully. Acting-wise, the film is okay, with Eva Green giving probably the best performance of the three. The sexual politics are portrayed effectively, though, by all involved. All in all it is a work I admire. I just cannot get the production design out of my head; the apartment is everything you'd imagine when thinking of an artsy, cinema-obsessed trio making love in seclusion. It is highly recommended to those who live, breathe and walk cinema (much like Matthew, Theo, and Isabelle), but to those who are at all squeamish to sex, I'd refrain.

2059975,4,B00023P4HY,"This is one beautiful, provoking, intelligent film. Brilliant direction, a daring and unsettling story, excellent acting by young and unknown actors, and an excellent setting. I think many who have or will see this film, like some previous reviewers, will see this film only as a Euro-sex romp or overtly fleshy movie. These are the people who see only what is drawn in a painting, read only the basic plot of a book, and notice only what happens in a film without thinking of why or how the artist does these things. They as well do not grasp the underlying subplot(s)and relationships things have to each other and how they are important to the whole work. Take ""Adaptation"", for example.

I hope you don't read the review by John Griffith's review. He's a really dum guy. First of all, it's rated R and a Bertolluci film (duhhhhh, will this have sex and/or nudity in it?). Second of all, he (like so many others before him) see this as only ""vulgar"" and distasteful. If you don't like nudity or sex then DON'T WATCH A BERTOLLUCI MOVIE! It's real simple. Griffith is no doubt a mathhead/sports jock type with the imagination of a lead pipe and happy that way. He'd watch ""Last Tango In Paris"" and call it a porno, read half a John Dos Passos book and put it down cuz it was ""boring"" and watch a baseball game. I'd lay down money he'd jump at the chance to play Matthew's or Theo's part in this fim opposite the wonderful and lovely Ms. Green.

The truth is, there is not that much nudity in the film. Nor is there much nudity outside of Theo. A bathtub full of soapsuds covering all hardly counts. Neither is there much ""sex"" as we generally think of it. Eva Green's character is actually a virgin in the film until she has one brief experience with Matthew. As for ""incest"", as mr. griffith put it, not true. He never even touches on the fact that Isabelle and Theo are twins, and as such they have a extremely close and special connection that is different than that of other siblings. This connection is very confusing and disturbing to Matthew at first, until he comes to understand them as one person with two parts. Instead, there is a plot set in the midst of a very turbulent and potentially explosive time in Paris, France, 1968. Three characters are joined by their love of film as well as their great passion for true freedom. Their very different lifestyles clash until they come to a mututal respect and admiration for each other. One aspect never changes, though, and it will keep them from ever coming together completely.",1119312000,13,2539,4.553610503282275
2059976,4,B00023P4HY,"There is an argument to made that pornography is the only truly honest form of cinema. Or, to be precise, all cinema is pornographic, but only pornography has the courage not to turn away at the moment of truth. However transparent their artifice, all pornography ultimately slams up against the reality of conjoining organs, and thus even the most contrived and absurd of scenarios is inevitibly redeemed by the unblinking gaze. Bernardo Bertolucci has always attacked this border between blinking and not blinking. Between the cutaway and the unrelenting visible. His cinema stems from the knowledge that film is the most erotic of all the arts, his camera relentlessly hanging suspended before moments that shatter the line of artifice and the real. The Dreamers is not a great film. But it attacks that line more violently then any mainstream film of recent memory. It testifies to cinema's dangerous power, as it leaves it to us whether or not to blink, or look away. To Bertolucci flesh and cinema are interchangeable, the conjuring of lights as real as the resistant skin. For him, we are all seated in the front row, recieving the moving shadows on the wall. Like the denizens of Plato's cave, cited to such extraordinary effect in a darkened room lit with shafts of translucent sunlight in his young masterpiece The Conformist. That film was set in Paris too. But a Paris younger and deeper then this one. The Dreamers's Paris barely exists. Its children take to the streets while Bertolucci's nymphs gather in Bachannalian entropy between walls, barely cognizent of the world-shaking events outside. Bertolucci has always been more interested in the politics of flesh than the politics of paper and fist. His three actors negotiate themselves by jealousy and need, seeking after the impossibility of conjoining. Like all Bertolucci's films, this also is a tragedy: the tragedy of the human self at war with its other, its second twin. Our essential alienation at mortal battle with our desperate need for communion. To Bertolucci, sex and cinema are tragic, for they both offer transitory, momentary glimpses into an impossible communion. Lovers are joined for an instant, then forever seperate. Movies last only an hour or two, then the lights come up. His French twins were once conjoined, but now they bear only the scars. So they are tortured: they have known the impossibility of absolute oneness. Once, says one of them, we were the same person. Like all Bertolucci's protagonists, they destroy themselves by hurling themselves against the wall that seperates all of us, one from another. Even in the streets, among the mob, there is no solidarity, and we, as the young American does, stand aside: watching. As we are watching in darkened cinemas and caves, lit by flickering shadows on the wall. As Bertolucci's merciless camera is watching. As the world was watching in those days in 1968 he desperately wishes to impart to us, in his own futile search, perhaps, for communion.",1118620800,10,2995,5.016064257028113

2059979,5,B00023P4HY,"You've never met a family quite like that of twins Isabelle and Theo - at least you should probably hope not!  This tale of self-indulgent living in a violently romantic place and time unfolds like a teenager's fantasy gone to a logical conclusion.  In other words, as the movie's hero Matthew discovers, it's the sort of experience that would be wonderful to live through up to a point, and terrible after that point.  But watching it from the safety of the other side of the screen is wonderful throughout.

An American student who witnessed the Paris riots of 1968 firsthand, Matthew is introduced as a lonely movie buff when he meets the twins immediately before the climactic events of that summer.  In a nice touch, he narrates the movie omniciently from the present time.  As the events unfold, the older Matthew shows twinges of regret here and there, but is for the most part defiantly happy about his short, bizarre friendship with Isabelle and Theo.

The friendship is initially based on a love of classic movies (allusions and even actual clips come fast and thick throughout), but the path from there into the twins' borderline-incestuous relationship is a very short one.  As Matthew explores his sexual awakenings with both of the twins, their world becomes increasingly insular and desperate almost by the minute.  This tension reaches a very powerful, er, climax (sorry, couldn't resist) long before the movie ends; but the remainder of the story is really no less interesting as the ""resolution"" doesn't resolve anything immediately.

The movie definitely earns its NC-17 rating, and it's not for the prudish!  All three leads are seen in various intimate circumstances, and I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie with more nudity.  As for the story itself, I found the ending slightly unsatisfying compared to the rest of the movie for reasons I can't explain without giving too much away.  But it is very compelling overall, and a lot of fun to watch from a safe distance.",1116374400,10,1992,4.8753709198813056
2059980,4,B00023P4HY,"In interesting movie well worth watching.
At first I thought the sex scenes  were  more than a tad sadistic and a bit of  a turn off and for a while I thought the movie was going nowhere but it does have a very satisfying conclusion and leaves one thinking.
The movie is visually beautiful a treat for the eyes and makes  use of a lot of old movie clips but as one learns the three students fascination with old film plays an important role into the story. For the Parisian twins live in their own fantasy.
An American student befriends a pair of twins, a boy and girl his age. They take him in to the home of their aristocratic parents who are on vacation. The twins in their parent absence turn the home into a sexually and politically decadent pleasure palace.
The American is somewhat wary. He realizes he is a stranger in a foreign country but some of the contradictions he comes across in this cocoon of youth he struggles with especially when he discovers the twins relationship is somewhat incestuous (whether or not it is truly incestuous is left as an open question).
There is definitely some creepy and some times down right ""ick"" factors to this movie.
The American is often put down by the twins for the American government and its involvement in the Vietnam war still soak up American culture to the point where one of the twins endlessly plays a Janis Joplin record.
Although I am sure the film is open to many interpretations the twins are somewhat symbolic of an incestuous culture. The twins also create their own world out of the wreckage of their parents world and live on the dole. And this seem to me to symbolize cultural decay. There are other moments in this movie that suggest this. The run through the Louvre may be a reenactment of an old film but I also find it symbolic as these three youths race past some of the world's greatest masterpieces.
Eventually the American becomes sexually involved with the sister. This causes friction between brother and sister as the world they so carefully created together is now being challenged.
The culmination of the film comes with the student riots in Paris in 1968. The American argues for nonviolence whereas brother and sister hurl Molotov cocktails at the police.
A beautiful time capsule and an interesting meditation.
Worth viewing. Perhaps worth owning.",1115596800,8,2331,4.678048780487805
2059981,5,B00023P4HY,"Ok, one of the things that interested me in this film was the trailers I saw in Europe:  a young nubile female strips, etc etc.  But the backdrop - 1968 Paris and its petite revolution - appeared the ideal context for a true film journey.  I have long felt ambivalent about Bertolucci:  his Last Tango was brutally shocking to me and a high school sweetheart, his Last Emperor appeared to exploit the cheapest ""Asiatic mysteries"" to me, an American half-Chinese.  But there is no doubt about the psychological depth in his unusual and audacious films, which always offer the unexpected.

This film is ironic in the way that many American films would never dare:  while student street fighting goes on, some pretentious youths - with conversations sooo like those I had sooo near that time - are creating their own little artistic-erotic world, safe in a cushion of bourgois money that is disturbed only by the strikes of basic services like garbage haulers.  I do not know if Bertolucci disdains the little revolution of 1968, but it forms an unspoken reference point to some serious adolescent experimentation.  I suspect that they are not studies in contrast for what was going on outside - in retrospect so selfservingly trivial and off-base an effort to re-make society in the space of a week - but a pure metaphor for what it all meant.

The protagonists are middle-class film nuts, who are taken up in the carneval of the 1960s with all its excesses and self-important sillyness.  I was similar to them, I admit, but was not in as exotic a place as Paris, though I felt destined to live there for a while (and did in the late 70s, largely for the reasons of the American character).  They play film trivia games, which when lost resulted in bizarre ""forfaits sexuels"" that are extremely titilatting to us folks who like to recall their reckless youth.  But it becomes deep as the protagonists get lost in their own personal labyrinthes:  the twins obsessed with eachother and with art, the American with the beauty of European difference and quality.  Having lived through so much of it, I empathised with all of them and did not find them as ridiculous as many reviewers have:  they are just young, experimenting before making tough choices, and enjoying it all while searching for some elusive ideal.  Haven't we all passed that way?  Or shouldn't we all have?

I will have to watch this many times before arriving at a definitive interpretation, but then that is the way with truly great art.  Also, I believe that this film will age well, will be interpreted at many levels as I enter old age.  Bertolucci really gets the double-sided nature of lucky youth:  they both see more than adults absorbed by a career trajectory and yet their insights can often be callow and pathetically selfish.  But hey, that is part of the jurney of life, and this film plumbs a lot of that depth with panache and zest.  I loved it.

When I did see it in its totality I was dumbfounded by its pointlessness, though, it captured the revolutionary excitement and free-spirited dynamic of Paris in that era. The sickening relationship that develops among three characters-- one American student and two incestuously close Parisian siblings-- did not make for an interesting character study.

Completely and utterly mesmerizing, ""The Dreamers"" pays homage to film, Paris, the 60's, and love. Apart from some of the awkward moments this movie tends to present sporadically, the movie itself was not mired by the abnormalities of some of the main characters. Though, this movie is one of the greatest I've ever viewed, it is not for everyone and cannot be readily recommended without reviewing some of the pros and cons I caught.

CONS:

-First off, if you're offended, in any way, by frontal nudity from either sex... caution: it contains a lot!

-For some, if the ending is a chief factor in deciding that you like a movie, it is possible you could be dissapointed (it ends in an unlikely manner). But if you can appreciate the ending, it doesn't hurt the film at all... Maybe people were disappointed by the ending because they didn't want it to end :)

-If not accustomed to slower-moving movies, based on a load of story depth or the like opposed to action or thiller movies, then it could be a let down.

But the cons are heavily outweighed by the pros...

PROS:

-For film buffs, Bertolucci doesn't dissapoint. The b/w segments intermingled within the storyline are anything short of genius and, for me, was the most beautiful and spellbinding part of this movie.

-For anti-censorship viewers, this movie could seem to be sent from heaven, because it doesn't leave much out.

-The acting is on a par with almost perfection, all three main characters are played flawlessly and completely take on the people they are supposed to evoke... Eva Green is especially amazing.

-The soundtrack is excellent as well. The tone that the music sets is completely appropriate and only adds to the dreamy atomsphere of the film; totally reminiscent of the 60's.

-A perfect representation of Paris in the 60's; eventhough the film's centerpoint is the main characters and their relationship with one another, the artist's home of Europe couldn't be portrayed to be more gorgeous (with the exception of the student riots in foreground).

If you were drawn to the movie by its NC-17 rating and for nothing else you will not be dissapointed, there is plenty of sexual material, but oddly enough there is much much more to this film than sex. I said odly because it was advertised as a sexual film but unlike other teen self discovery movies like ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" the sex here seems to belong instead of feeling awkward to see.

I espcially love the addition of classic french film scenes, in particular the scene where Anna and her two friends from Bande Apart run through the Louvre and the trio from the Dreamers reenact and try to beat their time of running accross the entire louvre.

2060006,4,B00023P4HY,"""The Dreamers"" is Bernardo Bertolucci's bizarre and fascinating (if not altogether successful) distillation of the radical `60's mentality.  Since the film is set in Paris in 1968, the radicalism naturally takes the form of perverted sexuality and extreme cinephilia.  Leave it to the French to be exploring l`amour in all its myriad possibilities!

In terms of plotting, ""The Dreamers"" is much like an incestuous version of Truffaut`s menage a trois classic ""Jules and Jim,"" with the new film's subject matter as shocking today as was the earlier film's in its own time.  Time and culture sure do march on, and it always seems to be the French leading the way.  In ""The Dreamers,""

Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) are twins who have developed a rather ""unnatural"" attraction to one another, becoming ""one"" in virtually every way imaginable - physically, spiritually, psychically.  Matthew (Michael Pitt, who looks for all the world like Leonardo Di Caprio) is the young American in Paris whom they pull into their strange little world of sexual intrigue and emotional games.  Matthew is a product of his time, a young man who is not very experienced in the ways of the world but who is willing to partake in the moral relativism that is permeating the culture.  Thus, he becomes the perfect candidate for Isabelle and Theo to work their magic on.  Their power of attraction proves overwhelming and irresistible for Matthew, for they are both exotically beautiful creatures, seemingly in tune with the trendy radicalism swirling around them.  Yet, Mathew eventually discovers that they are really only passive observers paying little but lip service to the cause, too obsessed with their own twisted relationship to actually step out and participate in those grand social movements they talk so freely about.  Isabelle and Theo are ""radicals"" to be sure, yet their radicalism seems to be channeled in a self-destructive, ultimately futile direction.  Only over time does Matthew awaken to this realization.

Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the subject matter, Bertolucci often seems more interested in shocking than enlightening us.  Isabelle, Theo and Matthew are so insulated and cut off from the outside world that the points Bertolucci seemingly wants to make about the times - as reflected in protestors marching in the streets, the references to Vietnam, Mao and Jimmy Hendrix  - feel tacked on and superfluous, not particularly integral to the film as a whole.  He is never quite able to bring these background elements and the foreground story together in any meaningful way.  What Bertolucci does capture well is the obsessive love the French have always had for the cinema as both entertainment and art form.  His characters live, breathe and think films, often acting out favorite scenes while the director intercuts snippets from the movies themselves.  The beautiful thing about the French is that they have always had such an eclectic taste in film, embracing both American studio and French New Wave products with equal passion.  And this artistic open-mindedness Bertolucci captures with gleeful abandon.  The film, in many ways, becomes an homage to Chaplin and Keaton, Astaire and Rogers, Samuel Fuller, Truffaut, Godard, Greta Garbo and many other icons of movie history.

""The Dreamers"" doesn't entirely hold together and the sum of its parts is better than the whole.  Still, the acting is excellent and Bertolucci has lost none of his skills as a director, making each beautifully composed shot stand for something - a real treat for audiences bored to tears by the kind of by-the-numbers filmmaking we get so often today.  Bertolucci is a true film artist and it is a joy just to sit and watch what he does with his actors and his camera, like a master painter working wonders with his canvas.

As for the much-vaunted sexual content of the film (it is rated NC-17), certainly those who are easily offended by nudity and provocative sexual themes had best avoid subjecting themselves to this film.  Those, however, with a more open mind will find little that is overtly offensive about what is shown here.  In fact, if Isabelle and Theo weren't brother and sister, there would be little controversy at all generated by the film.  My suspicion is that Bertolucci and writer Gilbert Adair made their film about incest because an ordinary love triangle would have seemed just too commonplace in this day and age to serve as a successful plot device for a film whose very theme centers around radicalism.  They really needed to shake the audience up and this was as effective a way as any to do that.  Whether it repels more people than it compels is something only time will tell.

As it is, ""The Dreamers"" is not an entirely successful film, but those impressed by fine filmmaking had best not pass it up.",1096761600,11,4848,4.991293532338308

This movie feels like an artsy inside joke between Bertolucci and his ilk trying to revive memories of the 60's. All three characters are movie buffs who have watched the most bizarre movies of the previous 50 years (I am talking B&W dawn of cinema stuff plus highly symbolic Eurotrash) and re-enact them in the isolated world of their apartment in Paris, while left-wing revolt shakes the city around them. The movie therefore is a recursive cinematic joke wrapped onto itself.

There is plenty of nudity, with homoerotic and incestual tension added in. I personally did not find much eroticism in the movie - the situations are simply too juvenile and/or absurd. Fortunately, the main actress is beautiful, and she is particularly impressive in the nude - which, sadly, is the movie's only saving grace.

The film was shot very beautifully however. The actress, Ms. Green has very real and very large handsome breasts, which were worth one star alone.  I also gave one star to the actors involved for being willing to be filmed completely nude in so many sequences...that must have been embarrassing to interact among themselves on the set all day while shooting. And finally I give one star for the ""modicum of erotic nature"" to the overall tone of what turned out to be a ""rather weak film"".

2060021,4,B00023P4HY,"Bertolucci's mastery of the visual medium is front and center in this film---every shot is gorgeous, Eva Green's willowy grace packs a huge wallop and more than maintains viewer interest (at least THIS viewer's, hee hee), and Paris doesn't look too shabby either.  In something of a departure for Bertolucci, the soundtrack is also prominently featured, mostly 1960s classic rock tunes with a large dose of Hendrix.

Which leads to one of the film's biggest weaknesses: the casting of Michael Pitt, who does a cover version of Hendrix's ""Hey Joe"" on the soundtrack.  His musical performance parallels his acting performance: relatively competent (it's not terrible), but far from spectacular (it could be a whole lot better).  He resembles Leonardo DiCaprio, just a taller and meatier version, but alas without DiCaprio's volatile talent---this comes out whenver he confronts the other two principals, Pitt has one of those baby-faces that's impossible to take seriously even when he's supposed to be undergoing the most intense emotions.  The guy is way too bland, white bread and innocuous---we never really sense or see any complexity, darkness or shadowplay in him, it's as if he got lost on the studio lot and wandered into the wrong movie.

The other major weakness of the movie is the plot itself, or what there is of one: conflicts are gradually built up, but never truly explode, instead usually fizzling out or inexplicably vanishing as Bertolucci shifts into the next segment.  You keep expecting eruptions from both of the twins, some cathartic outbursts of physical and/or emotional violence...but it never comes.

The last shot of the film, of oncoming hordes of black-uniformed French cops charging student demonstrators in Paris, is beautiful and intriguing.  The French twins have stayed to fight the cops, the American has walked away saying that all violence is wrong.  It's slow motion, with no sound---just an Edith Piaf song (""No Regrets"") which begins at its peak, then briefly shares the soundstage with a Jimi Hendrix tune (""Third Stone From The Sun"") before fading away so that we are left with is Hendrix's psychedelic riffs as the credits roll across a black screen.

The subtext is clear: this film is not about any ordinary 3 horny and slackerly postpubescents ""coming of age"" but rather an allegory of American and French culture, and their unique interplay.  They are both attracted and repulsed by each other, and in the end they must go their own separate ways to their own separate destinies---France, to decline and oblivion (the 1968 riots are romantic replays of its 18th century revolutionary glory) while America, to world dominance of its deeply ambiguous culture as exemplified by Hendrix's distorted yet melodic music, at once dreamlike and brutal.

Even if you don't get or agree with the subtext, this is still a gorgeously made film, well worth the 2 hours.",1092787200,5,2903,5.09915611814346
2060022,4,B00023P4HY,"This movie is about 3 kids.  They see themselves as bohemian, decadent, and revolutionary!  But while Paris is in tumult outside in March of 1968 they hole up and make love, smoke cigarettes, talk about films, and get drunk.  Oh yeah, and two of them are twins (boy and girl)who woo an American (Michael Pitt) to stay with them while their parents are away.  They all act adolescent - even in their supercharged sex scenes.  Their conversations are meant to be pedantic and pedestrian, the setting is meant to be claustrophobic, and the love triangle is meant to be icky and incestuous.

This is a beautifully shot artistic film.  Well-acted and well-photographed.  But it's not as revolutionary as it wants to be!  We've been here before, and Bertolucci's LAST TANGO IN PARIS seemed like a revolution in 1972 ... but 30 years later this incarnation called THE DREAMERS is just an upscale respectable 9 1/2 WEEKS.  But it's a great fun way to pass an evening!

Get this NC-17 version.  It runs 3 minutes longer, and has more nudity.  The sex is a part of the story ... actually the sex is the story since this is a discovery for the three leads.  So you might as well see it all.  But it's still not THAT shocking.  It has a relentless air of being artsy to take any sting of soft porn right off.  This is artful, and very European ... sex is not as big a taboo there.  In Italy this unrated cut was approved for ages 14 and up!

2060023,5,B00023P4HY,"The Dreamers has all the makings of a movie that I should have hated. First, it is a foreign film, set in France, with subtitles. It is an ode to the cinema. As if all of that weren't bad enough, the three main characters are freaks, some of the dialog can't be understood, and then there's the surreal treatment of bodily fluids. It's nothing short of culture shock.

 In spite of all that, I somehow fell in love with this movie.

 This movie is filled with full frontal nudity and sexual content and therefore marketed as an erotic flick. It's not. It is a many layered movie, and amongst the most interesting layers is its psycho-sexual deconstruction of Communism.

 Matthew, brilliantly played by Michael Pitt, is an idealistic American student studying in France who meets revolutionary twins of a famous French poet. He spends the summer with them in a twisty intellectual apartment, being seduced, literally and figuratively, by their concept of togetherness. ""You are one of us!"" they chant at him, but we know it's never to be.

 Instead of merging with them, the American increasingly attempts to break their co-dependence and to preserve his own identity. There is a particularly telling moment when he is asked to think about communism like a film, where the actors march with books instead of guns. Matthew points out that they would be marching with the same book, and that their sameness would make it a movie in which everyone was just an extra. This is a poignant comparison to his relationship with the twins--a conduit of their love, and an extra in their lives.

 It would be easy to dislike the characters in this movie. They are spoiled, idealistic fools. But each actor brings enough charisma and vulnerability to their role that its difficult to hold these things against them. Moreover, there are a surprising number of touching moments--surprising both for their frequency and for the odd circumstances that render them touching.

 There is the scene in the kitchen where our American student first consummates his relationship with Isabel in front of her brother and the situation turns from kinky-sex-game to connection. There is the scene in Isabel's room when she is pounding on the wall and crying for her brother. And though I found it personally unsatisfying, the ending was appropriate and evocative of Adam and Eve being kicked out of the Garden of Eden. The emotions and poetry of these moments are not what one would expect from this subject matter or from this setting, but they resonate nonetheless.

 This movie is strange. It is not for the faint of heart or for the anti-intellectual. It is, however, richly layered and will linger long after the final credits.",1091664000,6,2705,4.864923747276689
2060024,5,B00023P4HY,"A Bertolucci coined phrase actor Michael Pitt proudly displays on the front of a t-shirt, and yet oddly enough, very appropriate to this film. This is by far Pitt's best performance as character Matthew, a cinema lover from the States, who by fate and then virtue of invitation comes to know the twins in Paris through mutual role playing of favorite films, debate on topics ranging from war and politics, to comedic and musical rivals, and intimate exploration.

Bertolucci's poetic use of classic film clips, classic 60's music, actual persons involved in the revolts re-enacting classic speaches and perfect attention to details in scenery make this a great watch, and in my opinion, extremely underated. The full frontal nudity alone should be enough to captivate some, while the inner battles between violence/love and self-growth/codependency will leave deep thinkers in a mind-racing state.",1091491200,7,897,5.316901408450704

The incestuous relationship between two of them is absurb given their very ordinary lives and the film never explains the roots of the sibling's desire. The psychological movie games they played were as harmless and dull as children playing dress-up and seemed an excuse for a more exotic fantasy. This film about an American youth hooking up with sibling students in France during the Vietnam era is not an homage to movies or art or the French cinema, it is an attempt at sexual tension but the result is limp.",1091404800,3,672,4.801724137931035
2060026,5,B00023P4HY,"I was hoping this film would be pornographic.  Unfortunately I found it to be a well-acted drama with beautiful cinematography and very expressive performances from its principal cast.  In fact I got tired of all the nudity because I preferred the idea of the three young cinemaphiles playacting and reliving scenes from their favorite films.  There are references to Godard, Truffaut, Jean Vigo, Chaplin, Keaton, Nicholas Ray, and others.  The film introduces us to three interesting, rebellious young people in France in 1968.  One is an American, and the other are a French brother and sister.  All three 'come together' with an interest in film, particularly the French new wave.  Ultimately, I thought too much of the rebellion of the characters was confined indoors and more scenes of them protesting and performing in society were needed.  Also, I never quite understood Theo's character and more scenes developing his relationship with Matthew would have improved the film.  I have to admit I was hoping for more perverse and daring sex scenes, like the scenes in Last Tango In Paris.  However, the scenes of nudity are beautiful, often poetic, and absolutely not pornographic.  I actually think dirty, ugly sex scenes may have served the story better.  But anyway, the reason to see this is for its interesting if underdeveloped plot and for the surprisingly good acting, especially from Michael Pitt and Eva Green.  At the very least, The Dreamers might make you want to see Godard's Band of Outsiders or Bertolucci's own Last Tango In Paris.",1090972800,24,1552,5.062992125984252

But take that away and all you really have is a pretty stereotypical film about a couple of incestuous French siblings who, in true French tradition, spend a lot of energy devising ways to tantalize and shock their naive American friend. Add to that the fact that the young woman is a pretty sick puppy, and you get a very derivative homage to Jules and Jim (the French classic about a beautiful and emotionally complex woman whose indecision between two men ultimately destroys all three). The political context is pretty much window dressing, and the film doesn't delve too deeply into the moral and intellectual underpinnings which finally divide the trio. Of more interest is the sub-theme of film-within-film; the trio is obsessed with classic films and their actions are informed by various films, segments of which are shown. This is an interesting device as far as it goes, but in the end Bertolucci drops the ball as to its significance. And to me the failure to include any reference to Jules and Jim was dishonest. This is sadly not the Bertolucci of The Conformist -- one of my all-time faves -- but even the worst Bertolucci film is of more interest than the best efforts by many others.",1090886400,4,1394,4.6938775510204085

For these reasons I've given it the 3 stars that I feel it deserves. However, I just can't make out what the point of the film is. After it was over I just felt like I'd wasted two hours. The best message I can come up with from it is, ""You should spend your life playing creepy sex games with your siblings, but instead go out and live it."" This, however, seems like it should be given in most people's lives.

 Not all movies have to have a point however, they can just be good entertainment, but this wasn't that. Afterall, personally I don't find incest erotic and this movie's main focus in on sex. The highlight of the film is that in certain spots characters act out scenes from old movies and their action is intersplice with the films they're mimicing. In fact it made me even go out and rent Freaks and Queen Christina the next day. However, as far as this movie is concerned, the film charades, along with incest, Maoism and Vietnam, is just another random digit which fails to add up to any meaningful real number.",1090800000,,1157,4.401869158878505

Youth was in full bloom and the calories of virtues were being burned brightly.  However, this fantasy existed within the confides of the apartment, protected from the the harsh reality of political instability and social normals.  Although there are some people who claim that this film is only about sexuality and perverted incest, I think they missed the point of the film.

this is all about life in Paris in the late 60s - so be prepared to see nudity and sex. The touch of a great director is that nudity is not erotic or perverted in any form or manner - its pure like the morning dew. It shows the apparent difference in American and French culture - but there is a curious under current of similarity where they identify with the same movies and same events.

After a long time I saw a thought provoking movie. This is not a Hollywood movie so please do not expect any melodrama.

The ending made no sense and there were a number of snags in the story that served no purpose.

The viewer is left too busy wondering ""What the....?"" to enjoy any fleeting moments of nudity either. I will admit, I was almost impressed by the use of the classic films to drive the story, until they ended and the scenes interjected ad no impact on the plot whatsoever.

2060033,3,B00023P4HY,"""The Dreamers"" is director Bernardo Bertolucci's homage to the Parisian youth culture that made Franois Truffaut and Jean-Paul Goddard gods of the cinema and made French the language of film in the 1960s. It's based on the book by British author Gilbert Adair, whose own sojourn in Paris inspired the story. ""The Dreamers"" takes place in 1968, the year when France's youth took to the streets and changed its culture forever. It was also the year that Henri Langlois, the curator of La Cinmatheque Franaise, the center of cinephile culture in France, was fired for incompetence and reinstated by popular demand. These are the events against which ""The Dreamers"" unfolds. A young American man, Matthew (Michael Pitt), who is studying in Paris for a year, spends his spare time at the Cinmatheque Franaise watching endless films, alongside hordes of French youth. There, he meets Theo (Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green), cinema-obsessed twins, who befriend him. When the twins' parents go out of town, they invite Matthew to stay in their vast labyrinthine apartment. The twins' family is obviously eccentric, but Matthew gradually learns just how unusual Theo and Isabelle are, as he is drawn into their world of cinematic and sexual games.

The convergence of cinephile culture, student activism, and the sexual revolution in 1968 Paris would be a superb environment in which to situate a film. Unfortunately, those events are largely in the background in ""The Dreamers"". They are enough present to evoke a sense of nostalgia in those who were there and to arouse curiosity in those of us who weren't. But Theo and Isabelle are so abnormal and insular that they are nearly oblivious to the cultural revolution at their doorstep. This is a largely cloistered narrative, the emotional action of the film taking place between three people who are shut up in an apartment. As for the sexual game-playing, it's explicit, but pretty childish stuff. I do have to say that Eva Green, who is a British-French stage actress, has an extraordinary screen presence, and I hope to see her in films in the future. It's too bad that this story has so little to do with the environment in which it is set. If something interesting went on in that apartment between our young trio of characters, it might be different. But as it is, I'd recommend the film only for Eva Green.

The DVD: Bonus features include two documentaries, a music video, and an audio commentary. The first documentary is ""Bertolucci Makes 'The Dreamers'"", which was produced by the BBC. It includes interviews with the actors, Bertolucci, Gilbert Adair, and talks about the events of 1968 in Paris as well as about recreating them for the film. At 50 minutes, it's too long, but it's interesting. The second documentary is ""Outside the Window: Events in France, May 1968"". This one is 15 minutes long and discusses the events that led to the '68 student riots in Paris. The music video is of actor Michael Pitt performing the song ""Hey Joe"" (most famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix) with a band, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. The audio commentary features director Bernardo Bertolucci, novelist and screenwriter Gilbert Adair, and producer Jeremy Thomas. They talk about the realization of the film's themes more than technique or the filming itself. It's a pretty good commentary. They don't ramble. In summary, the two documentaries are informative, if a little tedious. Watch the first if you want to learn about filming, the second if you want to learn about the historical events which serve as the film's backdrop. Skip the music video. If you are more interested in the film's ideas and their adaptation from the novel, the audio commentary is your thing. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish.

2060047,5,B00023P4HY,"The decor for The Dreamers, Bertolucci's sensual and narcotic film is represented by effervescent moments that took place in Paris in 1968. In the same manner in which the house inhabited by the three main protagonists represents a character, so do the Parisian streets, with their trepidation and demonstrations. Contrary to other films directed by this director - who has promised much and delivered even more throughout his career - The Dreamers opens in a fast-paced and provocative manner. The director establishes the cinematic convention precisely, eloquently, and elegantly. It becomes clear that the film deals with furious and beautiful young people who live through the films they devour. In the first five minutes, the heroine of the picture (played impeccably by Eva Green, a theatre actress reminiscent of Isabella Rossellini) announces that she was born in 1959. Logically, it is impossible, seeing that the year is 1968 and she seems to be at least 19 years old. Therefore, she explains further: 1959, Champs-Elysee, where she yelled ""New York Herald Tribune!"" Suddenly the film cuts to a scene from the classic Breathless (A bout de souffle) by Godard, where Belmondo's feminine partner sells American newspapers on Champs-Elysee. Consequently, Bertolucci's feminine character believes that she has not been alive until seeing the afore-mentioned film, considered by many the beginning of the New Wave. The idea of interposing images and references to classic films is augmented in The Dreamers. It becomes a means of communication between the characters and in fact it ignites the entire ""action"" of the film.

 As in The Last Tango in Paris or Stealing Beauty, sex and sensuality also represent means of expression on which the director relies heavily. Yet The Dreamers rejects the desperation of The Last Tango through a seductive irreverence that indeed characterizes the so-called ""enfants terribles"" of 1968 Paris. It should be noted that The Dreamers contains various sexual and nude scenes, but that these are by no means as shocking as the sex scenes in The Last Tango were, when that film was released in the 1960s. Since then, video and Internet pornography have occurred and shocking audiences through nudity has become something of a moot point. It is only the MPAA that hasn't grown up. It gave The Dreamers basically the same rating that The Last Tango got, 30 years ago.

 What is undoubtedly very fresh in The Dreamers are the angles of the shots, the steady-cam that flies over everything. As in other films by Bertolucci, practically every shot could be cut out and studied hours at an end for its elegance. The three main characters (all played beyond reproach) live their menage-a-trois through concrete gestures and attitudes, as well as through emotions that are suggested by the sublime cinematography.

 The ending of the film, considered by some critics a weak point, is in fact quite accomplished. American viewers (including some critics) are used to American films, in which the build-up leading to the climax is essentially dynamic, suspenseful or tragic. But the European cinema is different. It often shows how feelings are condensed in a quiet but explosive mixture. This description fits The Dreamers like a glove.",1090281600,4,3265,5.185958254269449

On top of that, the movie includes clips from movies, and movie references abound - great for a film aficianado!

The movie does involve a few sex games, and there is frontal nudity (including close-ups, but if you don't mind, or simply accept them as part of the story, it just flows with the ideas behind the story of these charactes.

The three characters have great ideas, conversations, and views on movies, music and life in the 1960's.

2060049,5,B00023P4HY,"Bertolucci's revolutionary film takes place in the tumultous summer of 1968 in which a young American, Matthew (Michael Pitt) has come to Paris to study French. He becames a cinephile and a frequent patron of the Cinemateque Francais, the breeding ground for the New Wave movement. Shortly after the firing of Langlois, he meets fellow cinephiles Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Cassel) and scores an invitation to dinner.

That's how it begins, but this movie isn't linear and it cannot be deciphered merely by the order of events. Quite frankly, I was amazed by Fox Searchlight releasing what may be one of the most revolutionary and sexually progressive films of recent years. In the streets, the young and old found their revolutionary voices in 1968 and fought to institute governmental changes, but inside this chic apartment another revolution is taking place as well only this one involves fewer persons.

Matthew is clearly enamored of Isabelle and Theo (though this latter relationship isn't as developed as in ""The Holy Innocents"", which I found took away from the storyline) but he is not transfixed by them. He realizes that though they observe the world, they purposely keep themselves outside of it. Theo's father correctly observes early in the movie that to understand the world and change it, you have to become part of it. This is a lesson Matthew is constantly aware of and tries to pass on to his new friends. The first inkling of how grounded he is in this reality comes with the Zippo scene (my favorite) in which his casual observation of how a simple lighter fits into every possible place. Life allows us to fit into many possible spaces as we constantly change and constantly search for the ideal spot, but the cosmic lesson in it is that we will fit into them and consequently, will fit ideally into the one we pick out. We must allow ourselves to inhabit the spaces and become part of them in order to test the waters all the while and we do this by leaving the comfort of our original spot and become part of the overall world.

The sexual relationship between Isabelle and Matthew was passionate, realistic and completely believable. We live in very hypocritical times where nudity has become more taboo than violence and it was a pleasure to see young people making love with all of the intimate gestures that take place between lovers. It obviously takes a great director to pique our cinematic memories and remind us that it takes two nude bodies to make love. The nude scenes between the brother and sister were a bit troublesome to the audience I saw this movie with, but the incestual nature of their relationship in the book has been erased. To me, they just seemed dangerously, asphixiatingly bound to each other, the nudity being just part of said obsession.

All three actors do a fine job, but it takes a brave director to end a film with a police action about to take place to the sounds of Edith Piaf's ""Je Ne Regrette Rien"". Bertolucci understands his young protagonists and knows the many errors they will continue to commit before they pick and choose what is right and what is wrong because he has been there himself.

The broader political world of the riots and the implications of what was going on quickly receded into the background until I could only think of the three main characters.  In this way I was seduced by Bertolucci's film in a way that made me escape the broader and one may argue more important, concrete reality.
Also, Bertolluci's usage of stylistic cuts and effects mimics French New Wave Film in what would appear to be a valentine to those works.  In some ways this is a religious ceremony for film devotees to worship at.

The performances are exquisite and the film is beautifully shot.  The three young leads give emotionally rich, complex and nuanced performances.  However, there are some odd flaws.  It's a period piece and occasionally we see obvious signs of modern paris.  Also, not every audience member may be able to handle the constant nudity which is so constant that at times i felt so anaesthetized to its presence as to find it no longer erotic but merely sterile.  The sexuality and lust in the film is well done, but at times I think more can be accomplished with a light touch than a sledge hammer.
Like many of his other films, Bertolucci leaves the audience with contradictions coexisiting together.  This film is sophisticated and simultaneously sets up a monument to film while condemning those that would ignore the real world for escapist fantasies.",1090108800,,2154,4.881868131868132
2060052,4,B00023P4HY,"I don't know quite what to make of ""The Dreamers"". How did a movie with the sensibilities of 1968 suddenly show up in 2004? Though beautiful to look at, it seems oddly out of place. What is a movie in this era of `either you are with us or against us' doing here? How dare a movie suggest that, after all is said and done, life isn't a matter of right or wrong, but of shades of grays? And what is this vision of youth, not as a dumbed down, almost quaint part of humanity, but as a vibrant, intelligent force which, by its very essence, begets change? Haven't we gotten past such nonsense?
Matthew [Michael Pitt] is an American exchange student spending a year in Paris to study film. He meets French twins, Isabelle [Eva Green] and Theo [Louis Garrel]. They quickly bond, and, when the siblings' parents leave Paris for a month, Matthew moves into their vast old apartment. Their bonding immediately takes a sexual and virtually incestuous turn. The adventure-seeking but ultimately puritanical Matthew is fascinated by the sensuous and all too worldly twins.
While most of the story takes place inside the apartment, it is set against the French student uprising of 1968. Purportedly, this all began when the founder of the French film institute was fired. It quickly spread and nearly toppled the government. Young people today know little about this event, but, at the time, it was front page news. It was an era of disillusionment both in American and in Europe. The culprits were the Vietnam War and the debate over the value of Communism. People over 30 may have been content to twiddle their thumbs over the problems, but youth certainly was not.
Brilliantly directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, the movie is also an ode to the beauty and power of film. The three young protagonists see everything that is happening around them in cinematic terms. Initially, this insulates them, but as the film progresses, it is their undoing. After all, as powerful as it is, art can only imitate life. It can not BE life.
For thinking [God forbid I say `intellectual'] adult viewers, ""The Dreamers"" may be a profoundly moving experience. For all others, I can highly recommend the sex scenes - not that thinking people may not enjoy them, too.",1090108800,459,2235,4.733333333333333
2060053,2,B00023P4HY,"""The Dreamers"" is indeed Bertolucci's Valentine to films.  (The ones he likes, at least.) But so what?  Many of the films referenced I have seen, some I have not.  Nevertheless, it all plays like an erotic Trivial Pursuit game.  The sex is graphic, but ultimately boring.  Roger Ebert in his review talks about the sex existing within a successfully created context.  I disagree, and have to wonder seriously about reviews from cinema wonks.  There is a corresponding irony in the film that perhaps Ebert should take to heart when serving up such questionable verdicts: Theo masturbating on a poster of Marlene Dietrich.  I think a better erotic/art film example could be found in ""Henry & June."" Not perfect by any means, but at least Miller and Nin were creators .  ""The Dreamers"" only offers spoiled posers.

2060056,4,B00023P4HY,"The atmosphere of this film is wonderful. If you love the revolutionary spirit of the sixties you will love this film.  What really grabbed me right away was the music (Hendrix ""If 6 was 9"", Doors ""Spy in the House of Love"", Joplin's acid blues). The new wave film clips from the obvious heros (Godard, Truffaut) were just so so.  I love new wave cinema but found the new wave film clips that were chosen kind of passe(the best clip was the Garbo which is of course not new wave at all). The music on the other hand was really perfect--Bertolucci chose not the big hits but the harder stuff from the lesser known albums that never gets played on the radio and so still sounds fresh and new and full of the mood of experimentation that marks that moment when ones eyes are first opened wide to those boundless and lawless worlds of art and sex.  For me the music was the perfect sonic compliment to that moment when ones youth is so ripe it is almost bursting.  In such a state society seems utterly ridiculous and revolution seems absolutely necessary.  That moment only lasts about one summer, if you're lucky maybe two.  What makes things especially exciting for these three youths is that the whole  world seems to be fed up with all things normal at the same time they are and so there is all kinds of revolutionary fun to be had.  The film opens with images of the riots that ensued when the director of the Cinematheque Francaise (Henri Langlois) was dismissed by the minister of culture Andre Malraux.  This dismissal outraged all the new wavers and their stars(Leaud, Belmondo) and everyone protested.  The dismissal of Langlois would make an excellent topic for a film documentary as the event is given credit for starting the spring revolutions that sprouted for a variety of reasons in a variety of places throughout Europe in 1968.  Bertolucci does not really explore the event but merely uses it as a backdrop -- its not the specifics but just the atmosphere of rebellion that interests him.  The characters in Dreamers are all admittedly vague as well and their response to their environment is also vague but then such is youth -- youth lives its own dream of the world, the world itself is only seen through a haze of ones own very ripe desires.  I think the film captures that moment of youth between say 17 and 18 perfectly.  It is not so much a character study as a loosely organized series of  vignettes that show just what kinds of things(art, music, pop and subversive culture, sex and other stimulants) 17 and 18 year olds bond around.  If you want some great powerful scenes between three powerful actors this film is not for you. There are no future Brandos or Garbo's here.  Bertolucci gets from these actors about what you would expect from three pretty pretty fashion layout leads -- well they are a little deeper than that, each of them have that searching sentient but sensual animal in the wild look. The nudity is there more for reality sake than for shock sake--the bodies are shown as beautiful and erotic but also as delicate and vulnerable things.  These are eighteen year olds --  not fully formed adults -- and Bertolucci captures what it is that makes them 17 or 18. He captures what it feels like to be 17-18 so well it was like being that age again for the duration of the film.  For that thrill of recognition of experiencing what it is to be 17 again for 90 minutes the film is worth your attention.  A lot of youth is just dumb and forgettable but some of it is just plain majestic. Bertolucci recalls it all and makes you realize(some of it anyway)  is well worth recalling.  Few, very few, film artists can relay their characters experience in the intimate and natural way Bertolucci does.  I would say the actors are adequate not outstanding but the atmospheres Bertolucci weaves around them are really something to behold.  In these atmospheres we can feel the artist remembering.",1089849600,,3928,4.601147776183645
2060057,5,B00023P4HY,"THE DREAMERS has certainly polarized viewers: those who are devoted Bertolucci fans welcome this very unique work and those who object to viewing explicit youthful sensual exploration loathe it.  Taken in the vein of Bertolucci's output, it is more a youthful version of his LAST TANGO IN PARIS and as such it is a rather quiet, elegiac exploration of the needs and desires of the disenfranchised youth of the 1960s.  The love triangle  here is played out by brother/sister Theo/Isabelle ( Louis Garrel and Eva Green) and the American student Matthew (Michael Pitt, in a role that is surprisingly well acted). How they interact, mixing their obsession with old movies with their need to act out their feelings in the 'self-imposed' repression of the isolation of a Parisian apartment when outside the real world is undergoing the Protest Period of the 1960s' disdain for the Vietnam War, etc, etc, is the crux of the ambiguous story.  There is no real beginning or ending to this piece, just a glowing string of theme and variations that in Bertolucci's imaginative hands becomes moody chamber music. This is not a film for the squeamish, but it is an elegant cinematic achievement that leaves a strangely beautiful afterglow.",1089849600,2,1226,4.995098039215686
2060058,3,B00023P4HY,"It touches only briefly on the unrest in Paris at the time - for the most part, The Dreamers are the three main characters that have locked themselves away in an apartment which has become their own universe.
Twins, Isabelle and Theo, whose parents have gone to the country for a couple months are the most alluring and deeply troubling characters I've seen in awhile. Matthew (who, yes I remember from Dawson's Creek) is an American studying abroad but much more caught up in the movies at the local cineplex.
In the movie, Isabelle keeps both boys tightly bond to her. There is subtext that she is not quite all there mentally all the time. Theo is just as unbalanced. Periods of calm marked with moments of insanity. That Matthew is in love with both of them is obvious and that he needs approval and love from someone.  I'm confused as to why his relationship with Theo wasn't really explored.
The bro/sis relationship crossed all lines into bizarre.
I wish I could get a hold of the book as from reviews there is more to it, but alas I was confused.
Very uncomfortable to watch with the sibling relationship and their almost cruel intentions to everyone -even eachother. Felt almost sorry for Matthew for getting sucked in.",1089849600,13,1228,4.658986175115207

2060062,5,B00023P4HY,"Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"" is a beautifully photographed, colorful and sensual voyage through a young American's (Michael Pitt) experiences in Paris with an odd brother and sister who befriend him. Set in the late sixties, the backdrop is unrest and student riots in the city. Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) share a mutual love of film with the initially inhibited Matthew (Pitt) and invite him to stay with them in their parent's house when the folks go away. Immediately, Matthew senses something incestuous between Theo and Isabelle but his infatuation with Isabelle propels him on. They play guessing games about films and have no qualms about nudity and frank sexual horseplay. Matthew (and the viewer) is seduced into their relationship. Many old film clips are featured throughout as they act out and quote favorite lines and scenes from their film sources. The young actors are quite attractive and the sex is explicit. However, I feel much undue hype has been exploited regarding the sexual content and nudity. It's there, it's part of the story---but I found it nowhere near as sensational as I'd read. There are a couple of over-the-top sexual situations (one involving menstrual blood) and the film deserves it's NC-17 rating but to be honest I wasn't as surprised or titillated as I was expecting to be. I found the film to be as much an ode to cinema as well as youthful sexuality. The actors are fine in their roles, the storyline developes plausably and the ending is as expected as it should be. It's a lush, erotic experience and the soundtrack is great with Hendrix, Joplin, etc. evoking sweet memories of a different, exciting era of exploration and change.

Both a love letter to movies and a coming-of-age tale, ""The Dreamers"" showcases the experiences of three teenage friends in Paris during the revolutionary period of May of 68.
Portraying the doubts, choices, dreams, emotions and fears of a generation (or generations), this work of art is expertly acted, beautifully photographed, very well directed and even has a compelling soundtrack (The Doors, Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix,...). An intimate tale focusing passion, obsession, sexual awakening, ideals, communication, alienation and friendship, the movie is also an hommage to the cinema history as it displays multiple references to all-time classics (Chaplin, Truffaut and Godard oeuvres, among others).
Certainly a delight for anyone who loves cinema and art in general, ""The Dreamers"" is more than a period piece and wisely depicts curious, confused and lonely youngsters who don`t know how to act as adults. Mixing fiction and reality, innocence and perversion, old and new, this Bernardo Bertolucci`s achievement is mesmerizing and incredibly addictive. Unfortunately, it isn`t a blockbuster, so most audiences won`t get to watch it. But one can always dream, anyway.

2060080,5,B00023P4HY,"Bertolucci's revolutionary film takes place in the tumultous summer of 1968 in which a young American, Matthew (Michael Pitt) has come to Paris to study French.  He becames a cinephile and a frequent patron of the Cinemateque Francais, the breeding ground for the New Wave movement.  Shortly after the firing of Langlois, he meets fellow cinephiles Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Cassel) and scores an invitation to dinner.
That's how it begins, but this movie isn't linear and it cannot be deciphered merely by the order of events. Quite frankly, I was amazed by Fox Searchlight releasing what may be one of the most revolutionary and sexually progressive films of recent years.  In the streets, the young and old found their revolutionary voices in 1968 and fought to institute governmental changes, but inside this chic apartment another revolution is taking place as well only this one involves fewer persons.
Matthew is clearly enamored of Isabelle and Theo (though this latter relationship isn't as developed as in ""The Holy Innocents"", which I found took away from the storyline) but he is not transfixed by them.  He realizes that though they observe the world,  they purposely keep themselves outside of it. Theo's father correctly observes early in the movie that to understand the world and change it, you have to become part of it. This is a lesson Matthew is constantly aware of and tries to pass on to his new friends.  The first inkling of how grounded he is in this reality comes with the Zippo scene (my favorite) in which his casual observation of how a simple lighter fits into every possible place.  Life allows us to fit into many possible spaces as we constantly change and constantly search for the ideal spot, but the cosmic lesson in it is that we will fit into them and consequently, will fit ideally into the one we pick out.  We must allow ourselves to inhabit the spaces and become part of them in order to test the waters all the while and we do this by leaving the comfort of our original spot and become part of the overall world.
The sexual relationship between Isabelle and Matthew was passionate, realistic and completely believable. We live in very hypocritical times where nudity has become more taboo than violence and it was a pleasure to see young people making love with all of the intimate gestures that take place between lovers. It obviously takes a great director to pique our cinematic memories and remind us that it takes two nude bodies to make love. The nude scenes between the brother and sister were a bit troublesome to the audience I saw this movie with, but the incestual nature of their relationship in the book has been erased. To me, they just seemed dangerously, asphixiatingly bound to each other, the nudity being just part of said obsession.
All three actors do a fine job, but it takes a brave director to end a film with a police action about to take place to the sounds of Edith Piaf's ""Je Ne Regrette Rien"".  Bertolucci understands his young protagonists and knows the many errors they will continue to commit before they pick and choose what is right and what is wrong because he has been there himself.  And he regrets nothing.  We should all be so lucky.",1081728000,108,3228,4.736185383244207
2060081,3,B00023P4HY,"Set against the vibrant background of Paris in the Spring of 1968, The Dreamers tells the story of three young film students, their lives, and, surprise surprise, their dreams.
Despite the tumult and ferment taking-place on the streets, the movie's narrative centres around the complicated relationships between brother Theo (Louis Garrel), sister Isabelle (Eva Green) and their newfound American friend Matthew (Michael Pitt). When their English mother (Anna Chancellor) and rich poet father (Robin Renucci) leave them in charge of their comfortable middle-class home, the siblings invite Matthew to stay with them.
Sensing a kindred spirit, they involve him in their re-enactments of classic film scripts, and increasingly bizarre mind games. Cocooned in their own little world, they are for the most part oblivious to the social upheaval going-on around them. Police sirens wail outside, whilst inside the self-styled cultural revolutionaries mouth slogans like they've been plucked from the script of a really cool film.
The Dreamers blends several distinctive Bertolucci trademarks. The unabashed censor-baiting of Last Tango in Paris meets the sumptuous cinematography seen in Besieged. The sole defining characteristic of ""The Dreamers"" though is not the political subplots or the cinephile mindset, but the sexual content. Indeed, it is one of the few NC-17 rated films to see a sizable release in the last decade, Bertolucci is no stranger to sexually volatile subjects, and Dreamers returns the director to his blunt focus on the human body. Trouble is, as deeply erotic as the film is, is isn't hot at all.
For all its flashy camerawork, often slick scripting and some fine performances, especially Garrel's, it somehow manages to disappoint, because the viewer is left wondering what the point of the exercise is. Maybe the lack of a point is the point, but I really can't be bothered trying to work it out.

2060082,4,B00023P4HY,"Imagine you're living in a large city, smack in the middle of a political uprising, all while trapped in a small apartment with two other people you hardly know (and vice versa), in a land & culture completely oblivious to you. That's the general plotline of ""The Dreamers"", whose story can be somewhat described as one that's frenzied on the outside and cool as a cucumber on the inside. A college student (Michael Pitt), in Paris on a study-abroad program, meets two youthful, free-spirited Europeans (Eva Green, Louis Garrel), including their highly educated, stern parents (Robin Renucci, Anna Chancellor), who are unsure about the intellectual prowess and sociability of this foreign post-adolescent lad. When this stranger in a strange land passes the test with the senior members (with adequate results), he takes to their son & daughter immediately, and the three young charges take to the mean streets of Paris, sharing a small apartment and tackling intense subject matter such as war, peace, the sexual revolution, as well as the revolt taking place outside the confines of their own apartment. With this ""nouveau"" French Revolution, the three inquisitive, skeptical young adults seem to enjoy being trapped in their surroundings, which makes the plot more intriguing and even more climactic with each progressing moment. The exchanging pleasantries and tensions forming within the group are similarly metamorphosized and intensely insightful as in ""The Breakfast Club"", where the viewer gets to know each of the characters, their personal lives, loves, faults, even their various skepticisms about authoritative views of the very universe in which they live. With the revolution increasingly building to maddening proportions, rather than focusing on the potential bloodshed occurring outside their door, our three upstarts accept the situation for what it is, and go on with their lives, overanalyzing and living in their own personal world and the pleasures of sex, politics and self-glorification. Bernardo Bertolucci, who directed this dramatic, semi-autobiographical account, leaves everything intact, without having the viewer going around in circles trying to figure everything out, and doesn't insult his or her intelligence in the process. Everything is both tantalizing and appetizing here, although I wouldn't recommend the cuisine! This otherwise satisfying, digestible epicurian delight is currently being served in grand-sized portions (as well as proportions) at your local art-house cinema. Don't be caught at the end of the line, or you'll definitely be out to lunch, both mentally and permenantly!",1080259200,,2627,5.521091811414392
2060083,4,B00023P4HY,"Once past the excessive, graphic nudity, or perhaps because of it, Bertolucci fashions a jarring glimpse of three fascinating young people against the backdrop of the 1968 French General Strike, which nearly toppled the government.  For the three principals, hedonism, narcissism, and intoxication seem to dominate against what appear as lightly held political beliefs - socialism, love, compassion, tolerance.  For example, siblings Theo and Isabelle sleep together naked, their sculpted bodies entwined.  The All-American Matthew (well played by Michael Pitt) comes upon them sleeping nude (and slowly grows to love them), gathering some deeper yet perplexing knowledge.  This learning process for Matthew weaves its way throughout the film: a likable youth from San Diego doing his best to slip into the idiosyncratic lives of these very French `60s eccentrics and their almost invisible, '60s uptight parents.
Bertolucci abruptly intercuts continuously with memorable past film scenes: for example, Garbo's soulful eyes laughing at Gilbert's insipid love from ""Queen Christina.""  There are many of these lovely, thoughtful old film scenes that weld the humanity of these three characters to that of past lovers and haters.  I found myself virtually loathing the insouciance of Theo and Isabelle, their adolescent adoration of things kitsch, such as Delacroix's `Liberty Leading the People"" with Liberty's face that of Marilyn Monroe.  All this while exchanging drunk, violent words over politics, cinema and ragout when true fighters faced the formidable barricades in the streets of Paris.
But this is a film, I think, that one must settle into. Much of the first half appears about nothing much, perhaps a light titillating comedy.  Slowly, we understand it is not that at all. The nudity, arguments, sex, politics, brilliant film cuts, and memorable period scoring give satisfaction to those of us  `lucky' enough to have lived through that tumultuous time. Perhaps younger, less authoritarian generations will view it with more intuition than we boomers. One of the director's realized intentions was to impart with his typical lyricism an inner realization of why love, even silly vacuous sex, is so much preferable to war (the General Strike and Vietnam, here).  The ending is doubly startling.  But by then, the parts have become the whole, the trivial vital.  The significant beauty of this film lies in the director's wise, consummate vision.  Well worth seeing.  (For an amazingly contrasting view of the same period, see ""Fog of War"").",1079827200,5,2550,5.422784810126582

The emotion of sharing the touch with someone else. Paris, 1968. a touch of rebelation. The will of changing the world, starting from yourself. You may like or not, whatever. But: NOT to be missed.",1079740800,14,357,4.59375
