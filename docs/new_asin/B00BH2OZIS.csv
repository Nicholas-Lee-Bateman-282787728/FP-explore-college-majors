8568358,5,B00BH2OZIS,"Blu Ray - 4/5: Kam And Ronson Ent. Lt. version. This Blu Ray comes with just the movie. The subtitles have some grammar errors but that is typical of products made and produced in China. The audio is good as well. Picture quality is fine. I don't think it's in HD though but how cares.

Movie - 5/5: This is my favorite Sammo Hung (acted) movie for it's excellent story and martial arts action. Though the tone is inconsistent with the way the film coverts from comedy and tragedy.......... well actually that is what makes HK movies great. So up yours.",1484784000,,553,4.475247524752476

8568360,5,B00BH2OZIS,"The Magnificent Butcher is one of the best kung-fu movies ever made. The calligraphy fight scene alone makes the movie worth watching. Sammo Hung Kam-Bo plays Butcher Wing, a student of the legendary Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-Hong, and gets tangled up in a web of lies. Soon enough he has more problems than he can handle and needs a little help. Sammo Hung is magnificent in this movie, as are the actors that play Wong Fei-Hong and the drunken master.

The movie includes some of the best fight scenes, choreographed by Yuen Woo-Ping, as well as great comedic anecdotes throughout the film. Although it's a 70's kung fu movie, it is not a Shaw Brothers production and feels like it has more substance. Baio Yuen has a small role in this movie before going on to star with Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan in Wheels on Meals, Dragons Forever and Project A. If you are a fan of kung-fu cinema, The Magnificent Butcher is a must see and arguably Sammo Hung's best film.",1400716800,,963,4.5344827586206895
