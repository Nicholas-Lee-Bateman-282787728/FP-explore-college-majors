8248622,5,B0012ZPJAI,"I recently had a surge of interest in the early 'iron-clad' ship technology and in searching around for information on the subject came upon this DVD of the old (1936) film entitled ""Hearts In Bondage"".  This movie is a dramatization of the events surrounding the famous US Civil War naval battle between the early iron-clad vessels Monitor & Merrimack.  The run time for the film is relatively short (approx. 60 minutes) and it moves right along - presenting the various elements of the plot in a framework of a romantic 'love story' that helps to emphasize some of the deep divisions within family life that the Civil War caused. Within this context the, relatively familiar, tale of the construction of the Confederate iron-clad ""Virgina' from the remains of the Union vessel Merrimack and the struggles that 'northern' inventor John Eriksson faced in getting his revolutionary design for the Monitor implemented are played out.  The film climaxes with an excellent recreation of the famous battle of the first iron-clads at Hampton Roads - the model works and special effects are very effective, even by modern standards!  I found this to be a very enjoyable viewing experience - with good print quality (B&W, of course) and an engaging cast and production values.  Highly recommended!",1275523200,8,1289,5.061320754716981
