8465506,4,B005CIX2LE,"This DVD is an advanced workout with much more variety than DVD # 1.  You need the following equipment for this DVD:  a mat, a small medicine ball, a stability ball, 3-5 lb. dumbbells, a stretch band, and a body bar.  I do not have a body bar, so I attempted to use dumbbells.  According to Maki, I am missing out on some of the balance features of the exercises by not using the weighted bar.

Besides the exercises specifically for the hips, the DVD also has a lot of core work.  There are a whole series of exercises done while holding a plank.  If you cannot hold a plank without your knees touching, you probably would have to skip this series.

The hip exercises will strengthen your post op hip(s).  I only have one replacement so far, and I couldn't even do a few of the exercises on the non-operative side!

Although there is a warm up at the beginning, I would not consider this a cardio work out.  The DVD also is not for the upper body at all.  This DVD is designed for strengthening the hip, core, and leg muscles.

The DVD is an hour and there is no option to mute the music and use your own tunes.  The music on this DVD is very repetitive and uninspiring.  However, Maki is very enthusiastic.  I will continue to use this DVD in the future to help strengthen the muscles around my hip replacement.",1377648000,3,1313,4.276422764227642
