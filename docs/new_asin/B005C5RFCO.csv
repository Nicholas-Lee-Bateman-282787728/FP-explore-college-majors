4651517,5,B005C5RFCO,If you think women are catty...you have got to meet the boys!  I absolutely loved this.  Watched it and laughed out loud at much of it.  These guys are great.  I think Ryan and Mike Ruiz may be my favorites only because they seem to have it all together so much more that the others.  Sometimes they look at them with the same resigned expression I know I used to use on my kids when they acted up.,1320451200,,398,4.051282051282051

4651520,1,B005C5RFCO,"I wish I could give this product a good rating because I'm actually a fan of the show but I have had nothing but problems when it comes to the dvd. I ordered it and used next day shipping. It arrived on time but much to my disappointment, the dvd wouldn't work in my dvd player or in my laptop. I kept getting a disc error message. I returned this item and was sent a replacement which also didn't work. I sent back the replacement for a second replacement and that one didn't work as well! Even though Amazon was very accomadating it is very frustrating, to say the least. I realize that this item is manufactured by Amazon but there is no excuse for the product not to work! I returned that second replacement back and was given a refund. It's too bad actually beacause all I really wanted was the dvd. Hopefully this problem will be fixed and I will be able to order this dvd at a later date. Will see.",1314662400,4,905,4.206896551724138
4651521,1,B005C5RFCO,"Just horrible. A waste of film, money, and most of all time. Boring! This is part of horrible television. Has nothing to do with it being a gay show. There are plenty of great ones. This one is not worth anyone's time.",1314316800,2,218,4.214285714285714
4651522,2,B005C5RFCO,"Let's start off by stating that i don't really know what direction to take this review in. The show, an all-male version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Real-Housewives-of-Orange-County-Season-One/dp/B000S2XD36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Real Housewives of Orange County - Season One</a>, is what i'd call a guilty pleasure. From the previews alone, I immediately cringed, and as i watched the first episode, i stopped nothing short of. It follows several ""A-List"" New Yorkers around on their adventures:

Reichen Lehmkuhl: winner of the 4th season of The Amazing Race (his ""claim to fame""), former boyfriend of Lance Bass, and a stage Actor

Rodiney Santiago: Reichen's Brazilian boyfriend, a model

Mike Ruiz: famed photographer to the stars

Austin Armacost: Ex boyfriend of renouned designer Marc Jacobs, and former fling of Reichen

Derek Saathoff: former model, current modeling agent;claims to be ""Lindsay Lohan's best friend. She stays at my apartment whenever she's in NYC""

Ryan Nickulas & TJ Kelly: Ryan is a salon owner and TJ is his assistant. Ryan is the ""den mother"" of the group.

I'll recap the whole season (because, unfortunately, yes i did watch it. it was shame based though) in bullets:

-Reichen and Rodiney are in a relationship. They keep to themselves until they have problems. Then, they look to their group of ""friends"" to vent. Austin and Reichen had a fling several years ago and from the look of things, he seemed to be jealous of the relationship and tries to intervene.

-Derek and TJ, the most flamboyant of the group, try to help Austin adjust to NYC life, to which he has moved to after several months abroad. Austin does things to piss them off and they cat-fight throughout the season, but ultimately end up being the best of friends which then result in the 3 guys turning on Reichen and Rodiney.

-Ryan and Mike serve as the sane ones of the group. They are the ones that everyone go to for help.

This show is...exhausting. I am 22, a tad gay acting, I'll admit i have my moments; so im sure this show was geared for my demographic, but it was just an embarassment to watch. Its very similar to watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jersey-Shore-Season-One-Uncensored/dp/B003IB0FUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jersey Shore: Season One (Uncensored)</a>, meaning, the feeling you get when watching it is THE EXACT SAME THING.

This is a show you should NOT spend your money on. watch it online if you must and save yourself the money.",1293494400,,2572,5.386533665835412

8464796,5,B005C5RFCO,"I was reluctant to purchase this for a long time because of the many problems customers seem to
have with the discs playing properly.  Well, I took a chance and ordered - No Problem at all! - they
played fine in every DVD player I have.  A real fun show, RODNIEY SANTIAGO steals the show
from first episode to last!  A lot of us are waiting for Season 2 to be released on DVD, which is
the only format in which we purchase these shows.",1426464000,,435,4.094117647058823

They will not play in any DVD player I have, even though my DVD players are all current technology. I would think that Amazon would either fix this problem, post notice about this problem, or simply stop selling the series until the problem is fixed.  It's disappointing and frustrating.",1338595200,4,401,4.555555555555555

Especially Season 2!!  I can't say the same for Dallas.  Ehhh... not so much.  But this show features stars such as Margeret Cho, Jessie J, and some others.  You have to watch these on LOGO.  Do this before you buy is all I have to say about that!
