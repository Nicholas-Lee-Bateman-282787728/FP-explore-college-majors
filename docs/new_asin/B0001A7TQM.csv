1984062,2,B0001A7TQM,Lost me fast.,1454976000,,13,3.6666666666666665
1984063,4,B0001A7TQM,Good story line,1454284800,,15,4.333333333333333
1984064,1,B0001A7TQM,"Terrible acting.  Very slow plot.  and and a lot of film of young, pretty strippers.  Really not necessary for the story.  So typical of the 1970s, 80s. movies. Glad I missed this one back then.  and I stopped watching after a few scenes.",1454112000,,238,4.441860465116279
1984065,4,B0001A7TQM,"Good movie moves a little slow but that's how police investigations move. All the women are of course beautiful unlike any I remember going to college on W41st. and 11th on Manhattan back in 1972-74 but then this was Canada. Okay back to the movie interesting plot twists and a few surprises along the way. Anymore and I'd spoil it, so just watch it.",1451865600,2,350,4.484375
1984066,2,B0001A7TQM,"A psycho is killing prostitutes and photographing his handiwork in action with a custom 22 caliber sniper rifle and attached 35mm camera that all breaks down into pieces easily hidden under an overcoat.  Richard Crenna plays a detective tasked with investigating the killings who doesn't seem to be all that good at his job.  Songwriter Paul Williams is surprisingly effective but underutilized as a pimp named Julius who the detective really hates even though Crenna's Sgt. Boyd is apparently not a vice cop and really shouldn't be dealing very much with pimps.

This had a lot of potential from the title of the book it's based on (Sin Sniper) to the sleazy, no longer there New York locations, to the nifty custom made weapon and the theoretically colorful characters--unfortunately pacing seems to be completely beyond writer/director George Mendeluk's ability--Stone Cold Dead moves like the characters are actually encased in ice.  There is no sense of urgency or suspense--just a seemingly endless succession of scenes that barely crawl, way too infrequent bursts of violence shot with no style or imagination and a movie that completely forgets about its sniper killer for unforgivably long stretches that feel more like bad TV than actual grind-house cinema.  My recommendation would be to watch The Exterminator (1980), Night of the Juggler (1980), Ms 45 (1981) or Fear City (1984) instead to get a healthy dose of pre-Giuliani Times Square sleaze and skip this dull turkey altogether.",1433894400,3,1495,5.186721991701245
1984067,3,B0001A7TQM,"The morality is a bit outdated, but it's a good representation of the 1970's cheesecake type movies - think Kojak with more skin.  Good actors.  I've always been a fan of Richard Crenna except for the Real McCoys TV show.",1364601600,,221,4.5
1984068,3,B0001A7TQM,"I don't remember much about it right now, so it was not a memorable moview for me.

1984112,3,B0001A7TQM,"Typical 1970's TV fare in both story and shooting quality. Richard Crenna made a bunch of these
big city detective-type movies. This one's entertaining to a degree, not too complex or engrossing however.",1474070400,,203,5.181818181818182

1984118,5,B0001A7TQM,"Great 70s 80s flick.  Has that Dirty Harry type of vibe.  Crenna always overacts a bit in everything he's in,  but this was a good find.  If you're looking for an old cop with a chip on his shoulder movie....this is the one!  Stupid twist at end....but overall a good flick",1472947200,,273,4.2745098039215685
