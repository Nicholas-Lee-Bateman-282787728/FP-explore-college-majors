3712644,5,B001NDH4A2,"We have been watching series 1 & 2 for four months now. I didn't even know volumes 3 and 4 were available! My toddler twins love 1 & 2 and request it often (by signing).

I really like all four dvd's.  Probably 1 and 3 are my favorites, then 4, then 2.  However, reading reviews, everyone is different. I find myself singing the songs even when the video is not running.

The ""baby"" series is a lot of fun - I like all the bright colors. It has a nice mixture of using real people along with cartoons.

I recommend this DVD as well as the others in the ""Baby"" series.",1264550400,,567,4.072072072072072
3712645,5,B001NDH4A2,"This is my favorite video of the series. My son (18 months) seems to like this one best as well since he actually sticks around to watch most of it. As far as songs go, volume 4 is the best of the series. The songs are very catchy...in fact, we downloaded the album as well. The signs build on those in volume 1 and 2. I would start with those two volumes first as those signs are most likely to be used (milk, eat, bath, etc.) The signs in volume 4 are more geared towards playtime (share, play, nice, music, phone, balloon, bubbles, game), eating (apple, peach, pear) and feelings (happy, sad, laugh, cry).

My son started watching this series when he was 9 months old. He can now produce almost all the signs he has seen in these videos. It helps us understand what he wants when he doesn't know how to say the word for something. I would highly recommend this series to anyone with a baby or toddler.",1264291200,18,904,4.286549707602339
3712646,5,B001NDH4A2,"We loved Volumes 1&2, and Vol 3 was seriously lacking. We were hesitant to get Volume 4 because 3 was so disappointing, but it's just as upbeat, fun, and useful as the first two. I think of the four Baby Signing Time DVDs that we own, Vol 4 is the favorite. If you're looking into getting any of these DVDs, I would suggest buying Vols 1,2 and 4.",1263427200,22,346,4.102941176470588

3712648,5,B001NDH4A2,"A friend showed us and told us about this program, and we have enjoyed it ever since. A lot better than Baby Einstein which just shows you the sign and doesn't repeat them.

Great Job.",1243123200,,184,4.257142857142857
3712649,3,B001NDH4A2,"So overpriced (it's 27 minutes) but my kid likes it. One word of caution: There is a section where feelings are talked about and babies learn the signs. There are several scenes of children crying - my little boy gets visually upset every time we get to this part and he has started ""fake crying"" constantly as a result. We've actually had to take this out of rotation because he fake cries so much (and saying/signing ""I'm sad"" to us any time he's not getting his way).",1468886400,,470,4.413793103448276

3712653,5,B001NDH4A2,We are convinced that our son developed strong language skills early on in part because of these videos. They really helped him communicate basic needs to us when he was little and reduced his frustration level a lot.,1463788800,,217,4.7368421052631575
3712654,5,B001NDH4A2,"This is one in particular is my two year old favorite...not sure why but she always picks this one. She also asks for Box of Crayons, Crayons and Happy Birthday.

3712658,5,B001NDH4A2,"I would love it if there were more signs. My 1 1/2 year old daughter watched these over and over until she knew all the signs.  It taught us both the basics and am I so glad because now that she's almost 2, she rarely has communication melt downs.  She can express herself much more easily than other toddlers I see around with less grunting and whining or crying.  yay signing time. I highly recommend it for any parent to toddler aged kiddos, as long as you're willing to learn too.  When I am out and about or at play groups, there is a big difference in her ability to communicate with me and her happiness around that.  Without the confusion or lack of being understood, we can just keep flowing.  Other little children often (from what I've seen) get upset when what they are saying isn't understood.  Even the simplest little things can be a trigger for a fussy scene.",1457222400,,875,4.39751552795031
3712659,5,B001NDH4A2,"Every kiddo needs the baby signing time DVDs. My son always preferred the first DVD but, loved them all. He could sign the theme song and do every sign in the movies by 1 or 1.5 years old. We love this series and are always ranting and raving about it.",1452470400,,252,4.06

3712662,5,B001NDH4A2,These sign language DVDs are great. My daughter has a much larger verbal and signing vocabulary compared to other 18 month olds. We started watching baby signing time around 8 months old.,1447200000,,187,4.875
3712663,5,B001NDH4A2,Love all the Baby Signing Time Videos!!! We watched volume one with my first daughter and she loved it but was quicker to talk than my 2nd daughter.  Baby 2 has watched them all!!! My daughter is completely hooked. These are the only video she will watch. Over and over and over again. :) She picks up new signs each time she watches and uses them in our daily life. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE interested in teaching their child signs or if your child is delayed in talking this really helpednus with frustration. My 3 1/2 year old watches with my 18 month old and she loves learning the signs too and using them with her sister. Its very fun to watch and she gets so excited when she does a sign and you understand her. LOVE ALL THE BABY SIGNING TIME VIDEOS.,1446940800,,761,4.321678321678322

3712665,5,B001NDH4A2,"Baby signing time is awesome! We've been using since our youngest was 10 months. At 13 months how she's using a handful of signs regularly, and trying out others all the time. I don' want to encourage my baby to watch T.V. so baby signing time are the only videos we'll watch together at this point. The songs are really cute, Rachel's enthusiasm is wonderful, and it's nice to have all the different babies and children showing you how they do the signs. Even when our baby is done watching, our other kids will often still sit and watch. ;)",1442620800,,542,4.43

3712671,5,B001NDH4A2,"My son has learned so many sign words with these videos.  They really help him communicate before his spoken language has quite caught up.  this Can (not always) reduce frustration since i can understand what he's saying.  He started doing a couple signs (More, all done, from the first edition) when he was 5 or 6 months old.  Now at 16 months he has many of the signs.  Since he signs often now as he is also trying to say something, it helps me understand the word he's trying for and repeat it back to him so he feels understood, where without the sign, i likely would have no idea what he was trying to say initially.  This is the only 'screen' i allow him to watch a max of once a day, usually during witching hour at 5, and he has learned a TON from it.  Absolutely great product.",1431043200,,787,4.206666666666667

Share is a good one too.

My daughter is 15 months old now, and has been watching these since about 9 months. It's amazing how well she can sign, and how much it eases everyone's frustrations when we can all communicate effectively with one another.

3712692,4,B001NDH4A2,We love the Baby Signing Time videos.  All of the signs have a song to help teach the sign as well as clear and helpful tips to remember the sign.  The songs on this one are as catchy but still helpful.  I would like it better if the opposite signs were more geared towards babies; I think opposites are a bit hard for babies to understand.,1400025600,,340,4.121212121212121

The whole set is the best signing DVD's out there.  I agree that some of the signs are a bit difficult for kiddos to learn, but as a parent/ guardian/ caregiver you will learn what their sign is for that particular word.

My only concern right now is that he is 2 and more interested in signing than talking.  He has not been watching daily because of this but I plan to continue to expose him to signing time as I think ASL is a great 2nd language to learn.,1373068800,,468,4.224719101123595

3712710,5,B001NDH4A2,"My husband is deaf, so we have purchased many sign language DVD's to help our young daughters more easily communicate with him - basically to reinforce the sign language we teach them already.  This is by far the best series of sign language DVD's we have come across.  The only negative for me is the price - they are more expensive than others and the running time is on the short side (most are just short of 30 minutes long) - BUT, I do not mind paying it for the quality.  My 1 and 3 year old daughters adore these movies.  Rachel Coleman is excellent and the songs she sings are very catchy and enjoyable - I often find myself singing them, actually.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone wanting their child to learn sign language.",1371427200,,748,4.391304347826087

3712713,5,B001NDH4A2,Our toddler has been watching Signing Time for over a year now and has learned around 200 signs.

We introduced Vol. 2 a few months after and she LOVED both of them and learned almost all the signs/words before she was 1 and even said a few of them. Something about Vol. 3 was lacking when we tried it out and she didn't really like watching it. We tried Vol. 4 when she was about 15 months or so and she took to it quickly and learned all the signs and said many of the words outloud after only one or two views. Totally worth it!,1367884800,,561,3.9734513274336285

3712718,5,B001NDH4A2,"I started my son on the Signing Time dvds at around 8 months, eventhough at that age he just watched and didn't do much.  He is now 19 months, 4 dvds (Baby signing Time 1-4) later and he signs nearly every sign on them!  Great tool for communication when kids are not speaking yet.  It makes less frustration for them and parents when trying to figure out what they want.  I would recommend these to any parent with a child. The signs are extremely easy to learn along with your child and the are also put into context for little ones to understand.  They also have the babies and children doing the signs to show what it would look like, since adult signing is more crisp than a toddlers would be. Very useful!! Fun and musical!",1364947200,,729,4.330882352941177

Ignore the reviews that say the Baby Signing Time is ""too baby-ish or annoying"" compared to the Signing Time videos.  These have been perfect for my little one from about 6 months up until now at almost 14 months.  She loves the songs and has learned almost all of the signs and uses them all day long.  It's one of the best things we have done for her!",1364860800,,421,4.148148148148148

She giggles with excitement whenever she sees Hopkins (the animated frog) and is totally engaged from start to finish. Her communication skills have greatly improved since watching these videos and there are far few tantums.

I'm waiting (anxiously) for the other volumes to become available for purchase digitally - and will buy them as soon as they do.",1362441600,,501,4.9523809523809526

My daughter is nutso for these videos.  She is speech delayed and these products helped her to communicate with us.  We bought the whole set.  She doesn't really watch any other TV other than this, but I can say that if you are going to let your child watch anything it would be this series of videos.",1362009600,,345,4.359375

3712725,5,B001NDH4A2,"We have all four of the Baby Signing Time videos and they have been so wonderful in helping us to communicate with our little girl. We started letting her watch them a little around 9 months and within a week or two she had used her first sign to tell us she was hungry. Now she's 14 months old and she regularly signs to us that she wants to watch Baby Signing Time - they are her favorite thing to watch by far. These videos do a great job of making signing fun for the child and easy for the parents, although I do get the songs stuck in my head more often than I would like :). The videos are well produced, entertaining, and perfectly designed to keep babies and young children engaged.

I could write an entire article just about the value of teaching your baby sign language, but that's another topic. I'll just say that it has helped to deepen the connection we have with our daughter, minimized temper tantrums because she can tell us what she wants instead of just yelling, and it's just been a lot of fun for us to learn sign language together as a family. I would not hesitate to recommend these videos to anyone with a young child or baby.",1354320000,,1152,4.260273972602739

We not only use these disks in the car when traveling to teach her sign...but I have to admit I use them to calm her down too.
I call Rachel (the woman who does these video's) the Sophia whisperer because if nothing calms my daughter down...she can!!!

3712728,5,B001NDH4A2,I attribute my 18 month old's extensive vocabulary to the baby signing time videos. We've been watching them for about 9 months. She can say all the words in the videos and you can ask her to sign a word and she instinctively does it. I think she is able to learn words that aren't in the videos more easily because she has already mastered the basic words from the videos. We have all 4 Baby Signing Time videos and the Potty Time video as we are starting potty training soon. We watch the Potty Time video even though we haven't started training yet. Both my husband and I are huge believers in this program and we tell everyone we know with small children about it. I can't wait until my daughter is big enough for the Signing Time videos.,1353801600,,742,4.307142857142857

Not obnoxious, just fun and entertaining along with educational. It is great that she not only shows the sign herself, but they have children of various ages doing the sign as well and showing the word and pictures.

When the theme song comes on she starts squealing and rapidly singing and saying 'baby.' And she signs along with the dvd! :) The songs are very catchy and really help me learn with her.

Bottom line, I totally recommend it. :)",1341964800,,405,4.1265822784810124

The songs are catchy (so much so that that I wake up in the middle of the night with them in my head), the words are useful and this is an excellent way to spend 20 fun minutes with you baby as we sign and laugh together during this time as well as cuddle and be close.

At 2 years he is still a little behind on speaking but has played tremendous catch up and we think its because of the signing. He still loves to sign while he talks and will ask for these videos. Great option if you don't want your child to just sit in front of the TV and watch uneducational programming. Would highly recommend the whole series!,1328745600,,515,4.26530612244898

In the first week, he learned not only a ton of new signs, but could also verbally say many of the words along with the signs--hot, cold, me, you, no, yes, apple, and more! I love these videos because the tunes are catchy, they keep my son's interest, and best of all, they are educational, unlike most of the stuff on children's television.",1312761600,,444,4.426829268292683

She doesn't understand the signs yet, but because i have learned them, i sign with her anytime i can.  I believe in the developmental process of signing with a baby and i believe these DVD's are a fantastic product for learning.  I am not always sure how they pick the words they decide to teach - but they cover a wide variety of topics and concepts, in volume 3 it's friendship, playing nicely and sharing, words that are opposites, stop and go, emotions and some basic foods.  Volume 4 includes weather, moon and stars.  I love these DVD's!",1309996800,,714,4.427480916030534

3712745,5,B001NDH4A2,"I wanted to buy these DVDs for my granddaughter. Although she is no hearing impaired my daughter and son-in-law as well as myself felt it was important for her to learn a second language, i.e., sign. She started watching Volume I when she was only 2 months old, she watched it at least every other day until she was about a year. Suddenly one day at the dinner table she signed for more and starting using all the signs that she had previously learned. It is a great way for her to communicate since as a 20 month old some of her words are difficult to understand. She started watching Volumes 2, 3 and 4 and her vocabulary has already expanded  in just 10 days.",1304812800,,662,4.296

3712747,5,B001NDH4A2,"We received this video about a week ago. We bought it for our 17 month old son. We have the first three volumes of Baby Signing Time, and wanted to get this last one in the series. I think that this DVD is a bit advanced for our son right now. Some of the concepts that it goes into, such as opposites, and emotions, are good to introduce at his age, but I think that he won't master the concepts for a while. But he was excited to watch the video, and was captivated the whole time.

He still does best with signs related to concrete objects, such as food, pets, etc. In Volume 4, I expect that he will pick up first on the food items, like apple (his favorite!), pear, carrot and peach. Other objects like phone and balloon will be good too. But I think it will take some time for him to understand friend, play, share, nice, feel, happy, laugh, sad, and cry.

The music in this volume is excellent, and I think that it's the best composed music out of the series. The songs are upbeat, and Rachel's voice sounds beautiful.

In summary, this DVD is better suited for older toddlers, 18 months and above, but the series as a whole is excellent, and highly recommended.",1301443200,13,1169,4.280542986425339

As soon as I turn on the DVD player she's signing baby and screeching at the children on the DVD.  Plus it gives me 20 minutes to fold laundry, do the dishes and other minor house work while in the same room.  These are great DVDs.

She signs 'baby' and goes to the tv to ask to watch the videos.  The music in 3&4 is more advanced, I didn't like it at first but it definitely grew on me.  Now I sing the songs in my head all the time.  We started watching this series with my daughter when she was 14.5 months old.  She is now 18 months old and I have seen her sign 52 different signs!  Her spoken vocabulary is 17 words and it should be noted that she came into our family from a foreign country at the age of 10 months-didn't understand a lick of English.  We are also a bilingual household (trilingual if you count ASL) so signs have really been an important bridge to communication.  It is just amazing that she can make us understand what she wants and needs using signs, when those spoken words are still months away for her.  Being able to communicate and meet her needs has been important to our bonding as a family.  We've also received comments from her developmental specialist that she has a very low frustration level and is advanced in communication for her age because ASL counts as a language!  I am very happy with this series and plan to continue our family's ASL education with the Signing Time DVDs.",1283990400,3,1303,4.360995850622406
3712755,5,B001NDH4A2,"We love the baby signing time and the signing time series in our home. ASL has really bless our home by giving us the ability to communicate with our child even in scenarios where he doesn't have enough grasp of oral language yet. It's made our relationship with him nearly tantrum free. We are always getting comments from observers about how well behaved and bright he is, and we attribute a lot of that to signing with him from birth.

Our son LOVES these videos, its some of the only ""TV"" we currently allow him to watch. He simply lights up everytime Rachel comes on the screen, and often signs ""more"" when the videos end.

This episode (#4) of Baby Signing Time is definitely our favorite of the Baby series. The songs are incredibly catchy, and the signs learned in it are very useful in day to day conversation.

I highly recommend this DVD to any families interested in signing with their child.",1280188800,,904,4.533742331288344
