8265608,5,B0017CW5TY,"What can I say we loved the movie, ""The Odd Couple"". Bored with the other film. It was still worth the value of the one film.",1355356800,,125,3.8461538461538463
8265609,5,B0017CW5TY,"I purchased this DVD because I loved the first Odd Couple movie...a laugh a minute.  When I saw this DVD of The Odd Couple 2, I needed to get it.  I truly enjoyed this second movie of the Odd Couple movies...it, too, was a laugh a minute.  I love these two characters and they play their roles so very, very well.  Now, not only did I get the second of these two Odd Couple movies, but there was an extra movie on that DVD, as well.  Two movies for the price of one...and a very reasonable price at that.

I enjoyed First Monday in October almost as much as I enjoyed The Odd Couple 2.  I would highly recommend these two movies on one DVD to one and all...it would make an inexpensive gift for a family member and/or a friend.

Take a chance and purchase this most entertaining dual movie DVD that Amazon is selling!!!",1354320000,,819,4.205128205128205
8265610,5,B0017CW5TY,First Monday in October is a great movie.  I show excerpts of it to demonstrate the inner workings of the Supreme Court to my civic students.,1325462400,,141,4.423076923076923
8265611,5,B0017CW5TY,"""First Monday In October"" should be an all-time great for everyone, especially those with an interest in the law. Some of the best one-liners I've ever heard came out of this movie. ""The Odd Couple II"" is very good, tho it's hard not to be when you've got Walter and Jack in the same movie. These are actual ""comedies.""  You gotta laugh (as opposed to a lot of new releases these days called ""comedies"" which are about as funny as a root canal). And you can't beat the price no matter where the purchase. 2 really great flicks on 1 disc. Try it...you'll like it.",1316044800,2,562,4.352380952380952
8265612,5,B0017CW5TY,I GOT THIS TWO PACK BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BUY THE ODD COUPLE FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY.THE MOVIE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES THIS IS JACK AND WALTER'S BEST MOVIE THEY DID TOGHETER. I LAUGH EVERYTHIME I WATCH THIS MOVIE. I HATE TO ADMIT THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN FIRST MONDAY IN OCTOBER MOVIE.,1295481600,,285,4.107142857142857
8265613,5,B0017CW5TY,Nothing better than Walter and Jack together in another movie.  Love the Grumpy old Men's and this one is to love too.  Hilarious!,1280361600,,130,4.608695652173913
