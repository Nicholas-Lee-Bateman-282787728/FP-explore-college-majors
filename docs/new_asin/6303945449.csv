739704,5,6303945449,"A dark and violent gangster film, set in the Watts district of Los Angelas, where young blacks become involved in robbery and murder. Hard hitting and powerful gangster film which is nothing exceptional in  comparison to over gangster films but has many moments with the fierce incidents that take place which is certainly shocking. Performances are grittily realistic as is the dialogue. A beleavable observation of Inner city life. The film also boasts a great soundtrack. Included in the cast are Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, Jade Pinkett and Arnold Johnson. The film was produced by Darin Scott and directed by Allan Hughes. Highly recommended!!!",970790400,,648,5.230769230769231

I felt this film reached a  lot of young guys, black guys  espceially, becuase it allows them to see  how stupid trying to be the badest thing out there does to you. After  veiwing this movie it made me a much stronger believer in the saying that  what comes around goes around, becuase even though cain was choosing now to  make the right decisions in his life he had done so much in his past that  he could not go on.",963014400,,615,4.2956521739130435

739709,5,6303945449,"Menace II Society is a film which grips you from the beginning. My first viewing of it was at a friends house but after watching it I simply had to instantly buy it. Tyrin Turner and Larenz Tate portray two young homeboys  living in the ghetto perfectly and I am looking forward to similar titles  with either of those two actors in. The video cover says it all: ""This  is the truth, This is whats real"" The storyline is magnificent as is  the soundtrack to ""Menace II Society"" I recommend this film whole  heartedly 99%",956793600,,520,4.431578947368421

Very naturally acted, and with realistic situations, lots of guns, profanity and violence, but that is the  harsh reality that some people have to face. There are no heroes and  enemies in this movie, it's just a look into the lives of desperate people  who are deep down looking for a way out. Great film. Also see the similarly  themed 'Boyz N The Hood'. Extras: watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a small  role. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!",956448000,,565,4.446601941747573

739776,5,6303945449,"This film actually made me wince while I was watching it.  Extremely graphic.  The tragedy is that Caine had the best of intentions but not enough character to avoid the pitfalls of ghetto life despite the many  positive influences in his life.
If you're interested in really  understanding what the challenges faced by so many inner city youth are you  can't find a better vehicle than this.  If you're living this reality then  please take heed of the message because slangin' and bangin' has zero long  term potential.  Education is the way.
White america needs to be mindful  and proactive because the harsh realities of poor black life will come to  pass for more white people in our increasingly economically stratified  country without intervention by all our citizens.",949708800,2,776,4.9765625

The harsh reality of growing up around violence and drugs was displayed in this movie by the actors great, seeing this movie when it first came out was like so hype because I'm from  Los Angeles and when it was over it was like D@*%!  Basically because  that's how it is in the hood,so many young black men get caught up in that  life and even though it's aviodable it's inevitable. This movie really hit  me (even though I was young when it came out 14) because I saw so many  brothers I know end up how Caine did.

7856903,5,6303945449,"The 1993 hood classic ""Menace II Society"" is one hell of a movie. It takes place in Watts, Los Angelas, and from start to finish, the movie is like one long roller coaster ride. The cast is excellent, the story is VERY realistic and believable. This has to be one of the best hood movies made, along with Boyz N The Hood, Juice, and New Jack City (more of a drug movie though). The violence never stops, and the overall grimey feel of the film never seems to leave. The movie definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat, however cliche that seems to sound. It's very hard to predict what's going to happen next with every scene, and it all comes down to a depressing end.

The story is told by Kaydee, or Caine, who is a little...well, troubled. His dad was murdered when he was young, and his mom overdosed on drugs. As the result, he was sent to live with his very religious grandparents. At the beginning there is a fitting flashback to his childhood, where he sees his dad murder another man at a party over money. Throughout the whole movie, Caine is pressured badly by his best friend, O-Dawg, who is young, black, and don't give a f**k, or in other words, America's nightmare. At the same time, he is dealing drugs, and trying to help out Ronni, his female friend, and her son, Anthony. Ronni tries to steer him in the right direction, along with several other adults and another friend. However, that doesn't mean that Cain listens. The story is well crafted, and the characters are very believable. You have the main character who is torn between which path to take, the other who doesn't care, one who is very religous and tries to get his friends to be the same, and one who could be a football player. All of the characters help to contribute to the movie.

Many people compare this to Boyz N The Hood. I like both movies, but I will say that this one has more of a ghetto feel to it. There is way more violence and bloodshed than BNTH, and there is a hell of alot more of smoking, drinking, and drug dealing. I still like Boyz N The Hood a tad more, for some reason that I don't even know. The acting and cast is great. Tyrin Turner as Caine, Larenz Tate (one of my favorite actors since this movie) as O-Dawg, and Jada Pinkett as Ronni are all wonderful in there performances. All the other actors do great in their roles too. The whole movie is shot brilliantly, and shouldn't be missed by movie lovers.

So, I'd suggest you pick this movie up, especially if you like Boyz N The Hood, Juice, New Jack City, Above The Rim, etc. Maybe if you just like violence with a message. The movie is great, there is not a single thing wrong about the picture, script or acting. There is one thing, just like in Boyz N The Hood: There are a few racial insights but not much. Just a few racial comments are made toward Caucasions, so if you're easily offended do not watch this film, or ignore the comments. Otherwise, rent this movie when you see it. You'll get your money's worth, and there's no doubt about that.",1106611200,6,3018,4.347517730496454
7856904,3,6303945449,"""Menace II Society"" is still a good film which explains to its public how sad it is to see black men murder one another.  However, I would like to point out to you, Mr. John Maxwell, the thoughtless statement you had made on October 6, 2004 by saying that it is COMPLETELY black men's fault for crimes being committed in this country.  You said and I quote that ""The real reasons for the neverending crime in Black communities has nothing to do with ""poor social environments"" or ""lack of education"" as so many liberals have said"".  You also said and I quote that ""After all, who created these factors if not Blacks themselves?""  Well, Mr. Maxwell, let me tell you what I think.  In case you don't know Mr. Maxwell, it is NOT JUST African-Americans who are responsible for why there are guns and drugs in the black communities which makes our communities violent and corrupt.  There are ALSO White-Americans, oh yes, WHITE PEOPLE, who are also responsible for why there are drugs and guns in the black communties  because they are the guilty ones who smuggle drugs and weapons into this American country illegally, which makes it possible for black men to have access to these things.  In addition, drugs and guns are global around the world in which they have people of all colors ( black,white, red, yellow, and brown) who are helping to tear this country apart with drugs and guns by smuggling these dangerous things into America.  Now don't get me wrong, Mr. Maxwell.  I am not saying that all white people are responsible for drugs and guns in this country, and I am NOT condoning the evil crimes that black men commit.  But at the same time, we have to tell BOTH SIDES of the story that White-Americans are guilty as well.  You have a very big problem Mr. Maxwell, and I suggest that you better CORRECT YOURSELF BEFORE YOU CORRECT OTHERS.  THINK ABOUT IT!

talent. So i went and watched the movie that was called their best
and that was Menace to Society. This movie was great all the thing
s that I loved about Dead Presidents were in this movie execpt
a heist,and war scenes. It had great acting,directing,and flawless
screenplay. Tyrin Turner was excellent,Jada Pinkett was good,and
I loved the appearence by Samuel L. Jackson but Larenze Tate
was the shining star. Larenze Tate played a ruthless,foul mouthed
,gangbanger and did a great job.loaded with graphic violence,and
non-stop foul languege and racial slurs not to mention drug abuse

7856909,4,6303945449,"but this is an unsettling and harrowing film. If you've seen **Boyz N the Hood** and felt relieved at the end by the uplifting aspect of the protagonist making it out of a dead end life, you're unlikely to have much patience for this comparatively darker and angrier picture, in which the characters seem to know that they're doomed from the start.
But if this puts you off, you're missing out. As you probably know, this was brothers Allen and Albert Hughes's first feature. They direct with great self-assurance, in a style that is mostly invisible, matching the naturalistic, low-key acting of the principals-- Tyrin Turner as Cain, Larenz Tate as the sociopathic O-Dog,and Jada Pinkett[Smith] as Ronnie, Cain's lady friend, who just wants to escape and make a better life for her child.",1026432000,,790,4.902985074626866
