8380116,3,B002TCRQR2,"This is another Frankie Darro and Kane Richmond film where the two pair up to foil some crooks.  In this film, Darro stars as Freddie Shields whose brother, on his first day as a state trooper, is murdered by a couple of thugs who are taking stolen gold to be smelted and sold.  Freddie and trooper Tom Marlin (Richmond) go after them and the man responsible for the gold smelting operation along with ""the boss"" whose identity we don't discover until the very end.
Overall, this doesn't seem to be one of the better Darro-Richmond films.  The story doesn't seem to hold together well and the script is weak at points.  But for fans of either actor, it's worth watching its 57 minutes of run time.",1270512000,,697,4.507936507936508
