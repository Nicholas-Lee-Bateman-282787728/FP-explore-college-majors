8593102,3,B00DH9DUSK,"I sat down and took a look at this cardio dvd and decided it wasn't for me.  Too slow, not enough action to do much for cardio.  Better suited to inactive seniors, I think.  I'll pass it along to someone who might be able to use it.",1406160000,,232,3.893617021276596
8593103,5,B00DH9DUSK,"In rating this product, it is important to rate it according to what is expected to be accomplished based on the advertised write-up: ""Nancy's Cardio Circuit Level 1 is a gentle, safe workout that is excellent for beginners or those who have not been exercising regularly. All of the exercises are performed either standing or sitting on a chair - no getting down on the floor."" One of the reviews was very unfair, giving a 1 star, because she thought it was a chair workout and was disappointed. You shouldn't be giving low ratings when the product does what was described in the product description.

I bought this DVD so that my wife and I could do a gentle workout at our home on the weekends using our HD TV. We already love the 1 hour Silver Sneakers class that Nancy teaches weekly at our local fitness center. She has a super fun personality with her instructional choreography and dance moves.

When starting the DVD, there are the normal FBI warning and injury disclaimers. To my surprise, you can start the workout immediately or go to the chapters menu. In the chapters menu, you can even select to have subtitles turned on so that you can see the text when Nancy talks. In the chapters menu, you see all 9 chapter titles with videos of Nancy above the titles. You can start the workout by selecting 1 of the 9 titles. It is recommended that you start with the Warm-up and Stretching (10 minutes of standing exercises), then the exercises alternates between 3 Cardio (standing) sessions and 2 weight training (sitting) sessions (28 minutes). I prefer standing when doing the weight training. Using the DVD remote, you have the ability to skip to the next exercise routine. The workout finishes with the cool-down and meditation (12 minutes).

I found the exercises to be very helpful in burning some calories while working almost all of the bodies muscle groups. By strengthening the muscles around the knees, hips, shoulders and the core muscles, this helps the joints and back to maintain balance and flexibility. The music was delightful with the proper beat to perform the routines. Even though the exercises use a light workout, I found that you could increase the workout by using weights in the cardio routines and doing some of the routines double-time to increase the heart rate. I would especially recommend this DVD to seniors or persons that need to workout at home. I gave a rating of 5 stars because it was fun and it accomplishes exactly what was described in the product description. Thank you, Nancy!",1380844800,2,2529,4.743181818181818
8593104,1,B00DH9DUSK,I got this because I broke my foot and I thought it was a chair workout.  She starts out standing.  What a total waste,1380240000,,118,3.875
8593105,5,B00DH9DUSK,"Cardio Circuit Level 1 is the best DVD I have ever seen for beginners, seniors, baby boomers, etc. The Latin Salsa workout is a fun way of burning calories while you move to the music. There's also some upper body toning exercises with oldies and island music. All you need is a sturdy chair and you're on your way to fitness with Nancy.

I love the way she leads the program and her choreography. I am a senior with reduced mobility and I think this workout is wonderful for other seniors too.",1376092800,,777,5.429752066115703
