8480820,4,B0007PIOJ2,"If this DVD represents the documentary ""Sapporo Winter Olympics"" by Masahiroo Shinoda, it is probably one of the best that came out of Japan in the 1970's.  Extremely difficult to find on video, this film is as much about a meditation on discipline and on pure atmosphere as it is a coverage of the 1972 winter games.  Each section has its own rhythm and flows effortlessly into subsequent scenes.  Narration is almost completely absent for most of the film, the director preferring you to experience the feeling of cold weather that practically chills you from the screen and the determination on the part of many entrants gunning for a chance to make their mark.

If you like pure atmosphere in a film or are just looking for a good documentary about the 1972 Sapporo Olympics I highly recommend finding a copy of this.",1229990400,,821,4.72027972027972
