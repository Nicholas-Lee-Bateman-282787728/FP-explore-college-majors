4371590,3,B004FVWUZS,"Can't lie there were some parts of this movie that really freaked me out. There were also some parts that had me laughing a little bit. I wrote a review on the last exorcism and i don't like horror movies unless its about exorcisms because that is the only thing that scares me. Only thing I'm wondering is if the black and white footage is actual footage or not. Lotta times the black and white footage didn't seem frightening at all, almost forced acting. The parents, the american psychiatrist and ESPECIALLY the german psychiatrist should be beaten to death by whiffle bats because they ruin the movie with their God awful acting. Those characters mentioned are the only reason i figured out that this movie wasn't real or the footage wasn't at least. The audio recordings mixed with still shots and short video clips of the girl are SPINE TINGLING. I kid you not when i say that certain parts of this movie will freak you out and others are so bad you might laugh a little.

Hard to give such a harsh rating when a young girl supposedly died and had a tragic suffering throughout the whole process and honestly the young girl who is possessed really made you think she was possessed. One nudity shot in the movie, didn't like it too much because none of the other movies did it or needed to.",1301270400,,1296,4.491525423728813

This is amazing footage archived from Documentary,Germany '76.
This is what all those Hollywood movies copied,culled from,abused for profit.
The poor girl goes through hell and its so sad,The ending is foretold.

4371592,1,B004FVWUZS,I was hoping to see a faithful retelling of the story of Annelise.  Instead the only thing faithful is the actual audio clips of her suffering.  You get very two dimensional acting here.  The girl playing Annelise does do a decent job but everybody else feels like the are just reading line they have just memorized. Even as a found footage it falls flat because it feel acted.  The best part about found footage stuff is that it is not suppose to feel acted.  Its supposed to feel real.  This does not feel real.  It feels cheap.,1299888000,7,530,4.402061855670103

4371598,5,B004FVWUZS,"Before I watched this film, I had no idea what exorcism is until I found Anneliese's story on Netflix.

This is the most extreme lie shot on film I've run across in recent memory. Yes, anyone related to the real girl should sue the pants off Asylum.

4371601,1,B004FVWUZS,"First, a question: why isn't it possible to assign 0 stars to something that is, at best, worthless? Better yet, a rating signifying that wasting time on a particular work will actually reduce your quality of life?

Substantial portions of the exorcism of Anneliese Michel were recorded and remain objects of study today, intellectually fascinating regardless of your thoughts as to the nature of her affliction. They are also very difficult listening to anyone with a pulse, not because of the horrific possibilities of what you're hearing, but simply because you are hearing a girl being tortured by something that triumphed over faith, science and her life.

Not one second of those tapes is represented in this shameless effort to capitalize on those infamous agonies. She was treated by a host of well meaning individuals. However, begged by Anneliese to continue, the priests stumbled along at a time (the 1970s) when understanding of the Rite was at its lowest ebb and the European Church wanted nothing to do with it; we have since learned the bishops had more mundane matters on their mind and little energy to expend in matters other than covering up the ""works"" of priests of a wholly different sort while trying to dilute 2000 years of Catholic ritual and tradition into something utilizing a third grade vocabulary with tunes more amenable to the use of modern dance and ukeleles.  The psychiatrists working her case had no greater guidance from their ""wonder drug of the year"" suppliers and swung wildly from one new and unproven drug cocktail to another. Her physicians were simultaneously stumped by her symptoms and shut out of the process of trying to sustain her body by her own wishes, expressed during lucid periods. (The priests, per protocol and from humane concern, begged her to allow the physicians to keep trying.)

In the end, this sweet, devout and thoughtful young woman was surrounded by good intent; and yet she died as if sucked down into a sinkhole of evil, the nature of which is debated to this day. Her death produced a media outrage full of ill-informed opinions and disinformation from all angles; the bizarre denouement at trial was only remarkable because a court of law actually sought to grapple with the ambiguities of the facts, and came away humbled. (While the result is slightly different, the German court's reaction is accurately reflected by the characters at the conclusion of the fictionalized film, The Exorcism of Emily Rose.)

If you want to hear the tapes, Google them up. Portions are all over the place, thanks to the subsequent trial that turned them into public property. (As an aside, those who believe in the demonic too quickly forget that it lies, which would explain the somewhat odd answers given to the priests during the event, such as the purported identifies given during the infamous rapid-fire responses in various ancient languages, the clip most commonly found floating around the Internet.)

If you are curious, watch The Exorcism of Emily Rose, a dark, tense fictionalization that brings out the issues very well, without dogmatic bias for any side of the debate.

If you are Christian, take to heart the only sense that sustained Anneliese's spirit through the end. She believed that if nothing else, her suffering was proof that there is evil in the world and we ignore its power at our own mortal -- and immortal -- peril. The use of ""Rose"" as the last name of her fictionalized self was a nice touch, given the vision of Mary that brought her comfort during her final days. She died as what she had once dreamed of being: a teacher, albeit in a very different sense. The blessed girl's demons took her life, but never her spirit or her dignity. No: for that, all it takes is a low rent film company.

4371602,2,B004FVWUZS,"I come here not to bury The Asylum, but to praise them -they alone have the courage to fail as completely and spectacularly as they did in the making of Anneliese: The Exorcist Tapes.  No other film company would dare release such drivel as this, but The Asylum continues to prove that no standard is too low, no ethical line in the sand too precarious to cross when it comes to their production of low-budget rip-offs of other studio's films.  In their world, sacred cows exist only to be milked for all they are worth.  Sometimes their wild swings result in home runs (Paranormal Entity, Mega Piranha), but more often than not they strike out looking.  As strange as it sounds, I have to admire them for this because The Asylum's commitment to failure is complete and unprecedented.  How can you not love a company that will do absolutely anything for the chance of making a few dollars?

Anneliese: The Exorcist Tapes is probably the blackest sheep in The Asylum's growing flock of black sheep.  It's one thing to make a film this bad; it's something else entirely to try and pass it off as the actual tapes of the infamous exorcism of Anneliese Michel.  Sure, these fake ""actual film"" movies are all the rage right now, but who exploits the genre in such a brash and obnoxious way?  This thing was supposedly ""discovered"" by one of The Asylum's own.  Here is the summary of this film (""discovered"" by one of The Asylum's own B-list actors) as it appears on The Asylum's web site: ""The shocking account of history's most infamous case of demonic possession, compiled from the actual videotape and film recordings from over 76 exorcisms.""  This is, of course, a bald-faced lie.  The Asylum's marketing guys must have graduated from some school for politicians to be able to lie at such an advanced level.  Personally, I find this whole thing hilarious, and that's one of the reasons I love The Asylum - they're the Baghdad Bob of the movie industry.

By any decent standard, though, this film is awful.  It does include a couple of audio clips from the actual exorcism of the real Anneliese, but nothing else about it is true.  The premise of this story is that Anneliese's local doctor calls in a specialist from America to look at the patient; both men barge into the house (with a two-person film crew in tow) and just stay there, despite the fact that the family and the priests conducting the exorcism don't want them there.  Not only that, they hook up video cameras all over the house to record everything (keep in mind this takes place in 1976).  When Anneliese herself isn't acting like a wild animal, everyone else in the house is fighting over the situation (with much of the arguing in German, mind you).  The doctors want to take Anneliese to a hospital, but the family and the priests insist on continuing the exorcism.  The funny thing is that the two priests seem to spend about two minutes a day actually performing any kind of exorcism ritual - I guess that's why it's taking so long.  As if the fake doctors aren't bad enough, you have their little camera guy butting into interviews and egging on the tormented soul to put on a show for them.

Aside from the poor girl playing Anneliese (Nicole Muller), the acting is generally horrible throughout the film, with Kai Cofer adding the further indignity of a bad German accent to his performance.  Special effects also come up extremely short - apart from the fact that the video crew in this film apparently had an HD camera way back in 1976, you won't see anything more impressive than a little bed shaking.  Particularly annoying are the 16mm-style doctor's notes shown at the start of each new day, mainly because the writing is almost illegible to start with.  Getting back to Nicole Muller, though, I have to say that this young lady deserves some kind of credit.  It takes guts to accept a role where your first scene involved you licking up your own urine, and never let it be said that this girl didn't give everything she had in terms of her performance.  Unfortunately, few will ever see it because the film isn't worth watching - unless you're an Asylum addict like me.",1309132800,11,4151,4.627557980900409

I also know this because I am very familiar with he story of Anneliese Michel and any google search will show you that the actors are CLEARLY not the real people.  This is pure junk - a re-enactment not worthy of a Hollywood B-movie.  I couldn't make myself watch all the way through so I do not know how accurately it tells her story.
