8135747,1,B000H0MN8K,"EVIL'S CITY is such a muddled and disjointed mess it's a Herculean task to figure out what's going on.  Two characters vanish from the script, another character appears out of nowhere.  A major plotline regarding a car crash is never clarified.  Religious undertones and psychic hoodoo just drifts in and out and the ending is ridiculous.  The acting or lack thereof is abyssmal.  There is nothing to recommend in this farce!",1365465600,,425,4.929577464788732
8135748,1,B000H0MN8K,Don't let the case fool you this movie is a waste of time. the story goes no where and the quality sucks. I've seen independt films before and they were alot better than this. i wouldn't take it for free.,1287360000,3,204,4.125
8135749,1,B000H0MN8K,"I agree. Give your money to charity instead of on this awful piece of drivel. Bad acting, dull story, no action...it's just plain lifeless and stupid.",1276992000,4,150,4.8076923076923075
8135750,1,B000H0MN8K,"I watched this one on fast foward x8...The lead character is dead and already in Hell, the end. Save your money, give it to a charity but don't spend it on this stinker.",1228521600,4,169,4.151515151515151
8135751,1,B000H0MN8K,"La trama trata de un pueblo donde la gente fue negativa y se cometieron tantas atrocidades y pecados, bueno al menos eso dicen, que les fue retirada la atencion de dios y por que recibio algo asi como una maldicion. El resto... unos reporteros en su afan de ganar un premio Pulitzer tratan de investigar el paradero perdido de este mitico pueblo que parece solo existe en leyendas. Llegan al pueblo al mismo timepo que unos militares, comienzan a ser poseidos, se empiezan a matar entre todos.. malos efectos, bla bla... el resto de la trama es irrelevante. Definitivamente esta pelicula parece que fue filmada por estudiantes con muy bajo presupuesto y que ademas seguramente eran los peores en su clase. Hay un par de ideas que se salvan de la pelicula como la entrada y un par de detalles en la idea de la pelicula. Pero ni esto ni nada mas en el mundo pueden hacer que esta sea una pelicula digna de comprarse o siquiera de ser vista. Las actuaciones son exagerademente malas, los efectos, ni hablar e visto a fan sin estudios de cine ni efectosespeciales lograr mejores resultados. Por favor evitenla a todo costo y si alguie quiere regalarselas, devuelvanselas y diganle que mejor les den solo la caja, quien sabe uno nunca sabe cuando pueda necesitar una caja de dvd.",1145836800,,1274,4.666666666666667
8135752,1,B000H0MN8K,"First thing i would like to address, is that Amazon have a glaring gap in their rating system.....The option for ZERO STARS! I found this technical mis-hap just before writing this review. As Evils City forced me to look for the elusive No-Star rating.

Ok, ok, here is the plot. A group of wooden teenagers find a dvd camcorder and decide to pretend to be actors.  The following mis-mash of poorly lit, badly acted, horrendously directed scenes are then compiled in no particular order and burnt to a dvd rom!

The final product is then titled ""Evil's City"" and sent straight to to 99p bin at Blockbuster Video.

I find it absolutley incomprehensible how this tripe could ever be funded! I mean, after watching the first 5 mins of this garbage i was ready to withdraw the DVD from the player....let alone withdraw funding for further production!

The film has not one redeeming quality....it is badly acted, terrible jumpy plot, horrendous effects...(you will laugh at the shots through the ""camera-mans camera"", the fuzzy c.g. is a joke)

.....oh....The ending titles are average...but barring that...the whole Evil's City experience is, well...Evil!

Steer clear of this DVD at all costs. You would do yourself more of a favour inhaling exhaust fumes for 83mins.",1122422400,3,1265,4.966824644549763
8135753,1,B000H0MN8K,"Evil's City is another badly made shot on video horror film.  What makes it worse is the fake morality message that's added to the movie (like it isn't bad enough being a straight forward horror film).  What do you get when you cross a balding big lunk, an annoying woman, a teased lesbian scene, three co-ed dorks, a company of fat soldiers, a mob of lame looking zombies, a wannabe gothic acting priest and a balding aussie dressed in black walking thorugh the mountains of California?  I don't know and neither will you if you actually try to watch and comprehend this movie.

Please don't watch!",1119744000,2,599,4.622641509433962
8135754,4,B000H0MN8K,"A fun, fast passed horror movie, Evil City deals with several reporters quest for the mythical city of Eteron, a city so evil that the traces of it have been wiped away. The more clues the reporters find, the more they become intrigued, until they find the fabled city under the mist.

However, the sinister truth of the city might even be worse than the reporters believed. Zombies, Government Soldiers, and a mysterious priest all seem dedicated to no one making it out alive.

This is a fun, odd combination of other horror movies such as Tales from the Crypt (70's edition), 28 Days Later, I Know What You Did Last Summer and more. Over all, the film is entertaining, if some what short at a scant 83 minutes.",1115078400,2,713,4.51937984496124
