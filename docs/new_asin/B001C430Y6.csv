A must for Sam Fuller enthusiasts..Fantastic movie,from the opening scenes one is drawn right in. Unusual story is typically multi layered from Fuller this quote from him says it all ""When Art can dramatize and hypnotize,entertain,educate,inspire and reveal;gripping imagination and convey a sense of reality,play sacred emotions and interplay blinding colors..That is art in its purest form and that form is the FILM""..S.FULLER. 1964...ps Italian version no worries on multi region player....",1275004800,5,574,5.686046511627907
