6488666,5,B00LK2Q5IS,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE WITH A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS TO SEE. PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE BIBLE.

6488668,4,B00LK2Q5IS,This is number 8 in an ongoing END Time Prophecy study.  Some of which is speculative but none of it is beyond the realm of consistency of Bible content. (That is my opinion),1409270400,,174,4.2727272727272725
6488669,5,B00LK2Q5IS,"Watchers 8 is a logical continuation of parts 6 and 7 and I strongly recommend viewing those first and in order to appreciate the full impact of part 8. In hindsight, I view parts 6 and 7 as two sides of the same coin and part 8 begins the process of showing how the two sides of the coin come together.

Watchers 7 won the Best UFO Film and the Peoples Choice Award at the 2014 EBE Film Festival for the International UFO Congress in Tempe, Arizona. This is no small feat considering this is a production that directly countermands and refutes a number of the concepts that are common in those circles. L.A. Marzulli, Richard Shaw, and their crew keep finding ways to outdo themselves and I certainly was eager to see the follow-up.  I was not disappointed.  The routine at this household has become to stop whatever we are doing or finish up when a Watchers disc shows up in the mail so we can watch it immediately.  The phones get turned off and the blinds get drawn and off to the races we go! In case you get the wrong idea, this isn't about being entertained. Far from it. This is about being riveted from start to finish via high quality information download and overload of sorts.

It is even stated during the course of the documentary that there is a connection between the phenomena out of antiquity, that left behind a super advanced architecture that we cant duplicate to this day, and to todays UFO phenomena. What about the elongated skulls that have been left behind in places like Peru where cradle boarding has been completely ruled out?  The continuing progress on determining the status of those clearly leans towards a genetic manipulation issue, which I would argue is at the center of all of the research being undertaken thus far.  If there is a genetic manipulation issue then who is doing it? Thats where we get to the Bible and warnings in Matthew 24 and Luke 21 where Jesus said it would be like the days of Noah and Lot respectively in the season leading to His return.  If you watch parts 6 and 7 before watching this you will have a very powerful foundation and impact on driving that point home with part 8.  How do you have this amazing architecture from back then that we cant duplicate in modernity and how do you have 20 ton missile silos moved with ease and no signs of manipulation while theres a glowing orb nearby? Thus far the evidence heavily leans towards all of these things being related and I certainly believe that they are.

The opening segment is a direct follow up to Watchers 7 that involves the implant removal surgery. A fair warning for the squeamish. Starting at the ten minute mark for the next five minutes is the surgery footage up close and personal of the implant removal. This was handled in a classy manner but it is what it is.  I understand why they included this footage. They did it for the benefit of anyone that would accuse them of faking this and inventing it.  Good luck with that.

This overall sequence may be the centerpiece of the entire documentary.  For people who keep regular tabs on LA and his work they are very likely familiar with the account that gets presented here.  The account briefly is that when they went in to prepare for surgery to remove this implant it was undetectable whereas every instance leading up to surgery day it was easily detected with Gauss meters, stud finders, ultrasounds, and so forth.  After some consternation LA and Richard Shaw went for broke and went for a brief prayer and appeal to the Lord asking Him to remove any potential interferences or obstacles in regards to that implant.  In a handful of minutes at most after the prayer the implant suddenly reappeared out of nowhere right where it was supposed to be.  The fallout from this event was not lost on any person that was there for the surgery or a witness to it. This was a complement of people largely secular in their worldviews.  This is not given nearly as much coverage or specificity in the documentary for reason that Im sure were carefully debated and considered but for those of us that follow L.A.s work regularly we know some additional details which I will share here. These details have been shared by L.A. several times himself on his blog, radio show, and at two conferences as of the date of this writing.  The details are as follows:  Everyone really was blown away by the fact that a brief prayer went up and maybe two minutes later that implant reappeared out of nowhere exactly where it was supposed to be and they proceeded with a successful surgery.  Peoples cages were rattled and again this is a group of people who were mostly secular. One of these people approached L.A. and Richard Shaw shortly thereafter and told them  I now believe that there is a supernatural component to the UFO phenomenon.   This person was no less than Dr. Roger Leir and for the remaining few weeks of his life after this event, according to both L.A. and Richard Shaw, there were numerous in depth discussions.  I wouldnt be surprised to learn by now that other people involved in that event were coming out and asking some tough questions as well.  We cant overestimate or overstate what potential seed planting a situation like that is when you step back and allow the Lord to come in and show up.

In another segment, a former Air Force captain named Robert Salas who served as a missile launch operator. He was stationed at Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana. He describes in detail how he was on duty one fateful night in March of 1967 and how a glowing, 50 foot wide red orb or object of some sort appeared outside and hovered over the front gate of their base.  Needless to say this induced mass alarm and alert status from everyone on the base.  Without fanfare, the object disappeared and people wondered what had happened until they realized that the nuclear silos were left completely disabled thanks to electronic failure.  Thanks to a Freedom of Information Act years after the fact it was disclosed that Salass superiors and others in government found the account of that night to be highly improbable to use their exact words.  In the same segment Salas gave an account of stories he had heard from people he deemed credible of similar situations where 20 ton missile silo doors were opened and closed on their own and other high strangeness along those lines.  Finally Salas gave an account of his own UFO abduction experience that had certain common denominators and rings of truth that are shared across the board. I find it interesting how it seems like certain people get targeted for lack of a better word and one strange incident leads to another strange incident and often culminates in an abduction or similar occurrence.  Thats just my own personal observation.

A truly stunning segment is one in which infrared footage is shown of UFOs flying overhead. These UFOs are not visible in the normal visual spectrum and whats especially disturbing to watch is how some of them are flying together in unmistakable, organized flight formations. Numerous experts are interviewed for this segment including Paul McGuire and Gary Stearman to assist with the Biblical and prophetic point of view on this subject. I would concur with them that watching those objects/crafts/whatever you want to call them operate in that manner would seem to suggest preparation and possibly dry runs for something coming.  You do not need to be a professional to see deliberateness and well-organized movement and layouts.

Chase Kloetzke is a UFO investigator, radio show host, and author. She has many years of experience covering this field. If you go to her website, chasekloetzke.com, and hit the about area I will let her credentials and background speak for themselves.  She describes an extremely disturbing closer encounter of the fourth kind that she and a group of people had together in a corn field. She a describes a huge craft descending without noise overhead and a feeling of terror overcoming them all to the point that it exceeds fight or flee and they all start clearing out. She drops several thousand dollars worth of equipment without a second thought while in process of fleeing and then realizes they aren't alone in that corn field any longer. She describes seeing a being that broadly fits the gray alien description but had no expression whatsoever and attempts no form of communication that any of them could perceive. She describes this as terrifying.  This is a credible witness backed by multiple people who were there. Why is it these encounters are always so scary and malevolent? I personally know the answer to that because these are demonic beings playing a rusebut the point to a segment like this is to put out there to the audience and establish the case.

There is another disturbing theory about the grays being bandied about.  The theory is that at least some of the so called grays could actually be created hybrids.  Thats extremely difficult to contemplate and I sincerely hope it isn't true but if its really days of Noah then unfortunately I have to leave the door open to that possibility while I cringe in the corner.

Another segment was dedicated to the discussion of Bigfoot/Sasquatch in the context of all of the rest of these things.  I admit upfront that I didn't give a second thought to the entire Bigfoot phenomenon nor did I even consider taking it seriously until I heard an interview that L.A. did with Ron on his radio show not too long ago. Ron Moorehead was the specialist interviewed for this segment. Ron has spent many years following up credible leads in this area and has had several direct encounters with these creatures. He has been able to record their voices.  Like many other topics of controversy there is a ton of fraud and nonsense that has to be worked through but it certainly is not all fraud. There is a credible element of high strangeness to Bigfoot.  How do you have these huge humanoid creatures who can suddenly disappear and conceal themselves? People see and have documentation of very large footprints and tracks on the ground that lead to trees or other kinds of dead ends and then suddenly cut off.  They either have cloaking technology which seems unlikely or they are interdimensional like so much of the rest of this which puts them right into the same realm as everything UFO related. It is conceivable that Bigfoot/Sasquatch is a watered down genetic manipulation product of some kind. If the theory is correct that the Nephilim spread far and wide when Joshua and Caleb hit the Levant in the opening of the book of Joshua and some of them made it what we know as the Americas now then it is important to remember they could breed. If they could breed then their offspring would breed and so forth.  This could account for the Bigfoot phenomenon and if it does it is disturbing.

As before I must once again tip my hat to Richard Shaws extraordinary talents behind the camera on the gorgeous productions values from top to bottom and the keen eye with the camera. He always has some new trick up his sleeve.  He has a wonderful eye and skill with the camera that are good as any Ive ever seen anywhere. I say this as a lifelong cinema buff.

There were a few segments where both Richard and LA were on camera at the same time together where they were discussing things that had been shown and fleshing things out further which I really appreciated. This added a nice personal touch as well as helping the viewer process and digest everything before moving on to the next segment.

Another segment involved covering the Nazca lines and how the more complex ones relate to the more complex crop circles and so forth.  Footage is taken from the air that shows an incredible scale and level of detail that becomes very difficult to accept a conventional, on the ground explanation for it.

Finally I must mention Dr. Roger Leir who passed away shortly after the production of Watchers 8. Dr. Leir has been a mainstay and a staple throughout the entire Watchers series and I, too, agree with others that his work with the implants will be looked upon as critical science. I would argue that has already begun because there are those of us that certainly feel that way now.  Its hard to believe hes gone and it will be very strange to see the next Watchers video with no Dr. Leir.  He will be missed and is already sorely missed by those who knew him personally.

Often times people ask what this has to do with the Bible or the book of Revelation and so forth.

2 Thessalonians 2:7-12

 7For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 8And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: 9Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

Whats the lie aka great deception?  I think what Marzulli and Shaw cover in their work and ministry is certainly a major component of that lie.

What do people think ALL signs and lying wonders means exactly and why wouldnt we see some kind of warm up leading into that final series of events?  We most certainly have been seeing a ramping up across the boards on any and all supernatural phenomena just as it was prophesied in the Bible that we would in the season leading to His return.

The populace has to be conditioned for it first and this has been done gradually for several decades at least. In my Watchers 7 review link at the top you will see that I quoted some other Scriptures and made some points that apply again here as well.

I hope this write up and discussion has tantalized you to check these things out for yourself and ultimately check everything against the Scriptures.  I really wish I could do more justice by all of this but ultimately seeing is believing in this case. I can promise you that Watchers 8 is 90 minutes of cutting edge, Biblically relevant information that will fly by and then you will want to hit the replay button.

I'm excited about Watchers TV as an extension of the concept.  www.watcherstv.com  Bookmark it!",1407283200,19,14509,4.631435257410296
