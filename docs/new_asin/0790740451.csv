109292,4,0790740451,"Drew Barrymore is a doll in this short story comedy about a southern gal finding a father of her child.  At first, I thought it was a comeback of the movie, Annie at the first glimpse of Sally at the burger drive in.  I  just love her charms besides her glossy lips.  Although funny, the only  criticism that sparks in this comedy is that Sally, who is so young and  innocent and who got pregnated by an overwhelmingly older man should  deliver a message to young girls to be responsible on their bodies.  This  is rated PG, so I would strongly urge parents out there to render advice.  That's all folks, otherwise, it is a great comedy for the entire family to  watch.",924134400,,669,4.357723577235772

109306,3,0790740451,"Home Fries is a movie that tries to be two things, a chick flick romance flick between a heavily pregnant Drew Barrymore with red curly hair (supposed to be a certain real world fast food mascot maybe) and a new employee (Luke Wilson) who has started at the rural highway fast food joint she has been forced to work the drive thru at so no one can see her belly (yep it's a classy joint).  The other thing it tries to be is a quirky dark comedy where Luke Wilson only wanted to scare his step father (the guy who unbeknownst to them got Barrymore's character pregnant) but due to his psychopathic brother is now an accomplice to murder.  These sons trying to please their evil mother know there was a cross broadcast between what they spoke into their headsets worn during the murder and someone else.  They are determined to track down those other people and quickly suspect the fast food workers.  Wilson's character will go undercover to find out what they know. Meanwhile while he is working at the fast food joint, trying to please his mother, the psychopathic brother (played by Jake Busey) is trying to find out who his step father was having an affair with and is determined to kill her.

Although it's entertaining enough and does have some good sight gags, and funny lines, the dark humour angle of the movie falls a bit short compared to other serial killer character blending into the real world type dark comedies of the late 90's such as The Big Hit.  Now I'm not a big romantic film watcher but that side of things just seemed a bit unrealistic to me.  A heavily pregnant woman still working in fast food in her late 30s who still lives with her mother and will be a huge financial burden, doesn't seem like much of a catch to a guy who's a pilot whose only quality time he's spent with her is consoling her while she's crying.  I could see the attraction from her point of view, especially with the better life that would bring for her and the kid but it just didn't seem plausible the other way round, especially when he learns who the biological father is.

The movie probably would have worked better if it was just trying to be a dark comedy, if it had given more screen time to the psychopath brother and their mother rather than trying to force a romance part of the script that just didn't really work.  I would have also liked to have seen more of Roy (Daryl Mitchell) the fast food guy who was training Luke Wilson's character and was alpha employee of the fast food workers. Wilson's character was a nice guy with a conscience who didn't like his brother's killing so still could have tried to hide Barrymore's character's identity as the mistress from his family and protected her as a friend or an innocent person and the overall storyline still would have worked, but been more plausible.",1454457600,,2817,4.495107632093934

109317,3,0790740451,"""Home Fries"" (1998) is an offbeat romcom about a pregnant girl (Drew Barrymore) who has two National Guardsmen after her - one wants to romance her (Luke Wilson ) and the other wants to murder her (Jake Busey). The two guys are also brothers. The girl works at a hamburger joint and the brothers are concerned that she might know that they accidentally killed a man by scaring him to death via a military copter, prompted by their manipulative mother (Catherine O'Hara). The dead man just so happens to be the brothers' stepdad and also the guy who got the girl pregnant!

As you can see, the plot's bizarre and so the movie should appeal to those with a taste for black humor and the outlandish. Drew's a cutie as always, but not as attractive as usual since she's pregnant the entire film. The story's isn't that compelling, but it's generally amusing, albeit rarely laugh-out-loud funny.

The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in the Austin, TX, area (with some parts in El Paso).

I didn't laugh, but I did watch, and you may, too, if you like Drew and Luke. This 1998 film gets them at an early peak. The plot is the weak link here for me. It strains credibility, as if two jamokes from the local air National Guard could get away with flying a helicopter anywhere they please on personal errands. At least there's no violence to speak of.

109348,4,0790740451,"Home Fries stars Drew Barrymore as a pregnant woman who works at a fast food restaurant.  The man who made her pregnant appears at the drive by window one night, and he and Drew's character get into a fight because Drew wants the guy to be a father for the baby.  Instead, the guy drives off.  It turns out he has a wife of his own and wants nothing to do with the girl he made pregnant.

Well, while the guy is driving back to his house, a couple guys in a helicopter decide they want to toy with the guy, and make him scared.  Unfortunately, the helicopter incident makes the guy TOO scared, and the next day the police encounter the guy sitting in the middle of nowhere dead from a heart attack.

The storyline from here is that the two guys in the helicopter do everything in their power to make sure they aren't busted for the murder.

Unfortunuately for the two helicopter pranksters, they retrace their steps a little TOO much to the point one of the guys actually works at the same fast food restaurant as Drew Barrymore's character.  Eventually the guy falls in love with Drew and well... I guess NOW is a good time to mention Home Fries is mostly definitely a comedy, haha.

The biggest problem with Home Fries is that the film is funny in a ""What kind of outrageous plot twist will happen next?"" kind of way.  The writers who came up with such a storyline did an *amazing* job making it sophisticated and intelligent, and they deserve a ton of credit for that.

As far as actual laughs go, well you'll be laughing plenty of times, but the storyline also has some dry spells once in a while as well, which is why I can't give it a perfect 5 star rating.

It's mostly a film that's worth watching for the brilliant storyline.",1277164800,,1734,4.3343653250774
109349,5,0790740451,"Hamburger join waitress Sally Jackson is pregnant. When Beatrice, the wife of the father, finds out about his infidelity, she sends her sons from a previous marriage, military pilots Angus and Dorian Montier, to scare the living daylights out of him. Their gunship does such a good job, without hitting him, that he dies from a heart attack. Worrying about radio interference that night, they investigate who might have heard too much within the fairly empty reception perimeter, and soon discover only Sally could, still ignorant about her affair with his step-dad Henry. Dorian takes a job there to be sure, but soon falls for her himself, while mother-obsessed moron Angus would do anything to anyone for her honor. This movie with Luke Wilson and Drew Barrymore is very enjoyable. This movie has a darker comedic theme with some action sequences.

109362,2,0790740451,"The concepts in this film are not compatible with a slapstick comedy.  An unwed mother impregnated by an older man and then abandoned to give birth with no support isn't a comedy. Any person who could make it one would have to have an amazing viewpoint and ability to show humor in tragedy.  This movie is not that intelligent. The back drop of sibling rivalry and overcoming family prejudice is at the core of the story as well, but again, the movie is ridiculous. The son who loves his father's mistreated mistress is an exceptional person who understands suffering.  Watching this movie is like watching a tree get cut down for no good reason; it make you feel bad when something wonderful could have been made but was wrecked without explanation. There is absolutely no shortage of talent, and this film's poor quality has nothing to do with the cast; a cast with talent that is being depreciated. The actors look like they know that they should be expressing more. The film also is slightly offensive if one accounts for the labor scene where Drew Barrymore is panting like a dog. It is supposed to be funny, but it is not. Why didn't the producers just make a drama?",1242259200,,1172,4.598086124401914

109365,3,0790740451,"Sally Jackson (Drew Barrymore) reprises her classic role as the lovely young (pregnant) naf next door. Jackson works in a burger joint, whose kindly manager lets her work the drive-through to conceal her delicate condition. Meanwhile, brothers Dorian and Angus Montier (Luke Wilson and Jake Bussey), local National Guard helicopter hotshots, have frightened a local man (with serious results) with their aerial antics. Problem is, Sally may have overheard the pilots on her headset. The boys need to find out what, if anything, she knows.

Just one look at the DVD cover will tell you that in spite of everything, romance is in the air (Ha! Ha!) between Drew and Luke's characters. The movie is likable and fun and generally means well. But the plot line requires a level of suspension of disbelief that becomes distracting. I mean, even the Guard can't take copters out for joy rides, never mind discharging boxloads of ordinance.

But in spite of its excesses, ""Home Fries"" was enjoyable -- cinematic fast food that was nourishing, if not nutritious.",1171238400,,1052,5.040229885057471
109366,2,0790740451,"This was a black comedy that unfolded over the first 30 minutes of the film, revealing one surprise relationship after another, until you realize that all the major characters are related in surprising ways.  It's kind of strange, because this movie wasn't terribly complicated, but I'm still not sure what to make of it.

Catherine O'Hara has her two military helicopter-pilot sons scare her cheating husband, whose cheating on her with Drew Barrymore. The husband is successfully scared (to death) and Drew Barrymore is an earwitness through her headset at a burger joint.  I won't say ""Home Fries"" is a complete waste. I was somehow taken in enough to watch the entire movie. One shining light is Luke Wilson, who steals most of the scenes he has, and the crazy thing is that he's stealing them from actors like Jake Busey and Catherine O'Hara.

It was the overall movie premise and plot lines that were average at best. After the first 30 minutes of the movie you could see the direction the film would take.

Luke Wilson, who is one of the best looking men on the planet, portrays Dorian, an equally kind and lovable character who has to deal with a crazy mother & brother, while falling in love with Sally.

The characters portray a range of human traits that are  humorous because we all know people representative of those traits. The acting was especially good on the part of Luke Wilson and Drew Barrymore. Wilson is so natural at it. His facial expressions are hilarious when his character is uncomfortable. His body language reminds me of what Jimmy Stewart does in some of his comedies.  And Drew acts with charm and believability. Try watching the movie in closed-captioned you may notice more of the mumbled language that makes the movie funnier.
There are a lot of funny things but you have to pay attention to catch them. There is a scene where the sheriff and his deputy are walking away from a dead person in an old drive-in movie theater and they walk zig zag around the  benches to get back to their car instead of climbling over them. One scene show Luke's character, Dorian, thinking of hamburger assembly while at a funeral.
  Enjoy all the little subtle things: the trailing off conversations, the facial expressions, the body language. It's funny in real life so it's funny here too.",1056326400,14,1209,4.76555023923445
109372,2,0790740451,"Oh, the joys of trying to make a good movie! So much can go wrong that it makes farming seem like a safe bet. Home Fries has all the elements needed to make a great entertainment, save one. It's badly miscast. As I watched its comically bizarre story unfold, I found myself recasting it.
Being miscast and being a bad actor is not the same thing at all. Everyone in this movie has proved themselves to be good in a number of other projects. They simply are not adapt at the maniacal kind of performing that this movie requires. It's in the same genre as There's Something About Mary, in that a serious subject is not to be taken seriously at all. These are what are often called screwball comedies.
Drew Barrymore is Sally, who is mine momhs pregnant She works in a fast food restaurant. Her lover lied to her by claiming was not married. To further complicate matters, Mrs. Lever is lethally jealous. She convinces her son Dorian [Luke Wuksin] and her stepson Angus [Jake Busey] to scare the devil out of the old man by chasing him down a county road in a helicopter. Unfortunately, this gives Dad a fatal heaty attack.
The rest if the movie has to do with Angus' trying to save Sally from his totally mad famly.
The story is madcap, and the dialog is crisp. Both the photography and the editing are sharp. So we return to the casting problems.
Parker Posey would have been ideal as Sally. Kathleen Tuner would have been great as Mrs. Lever. Cast Brad Pitt as the psycho brother, and Keanu Reeves as Angus, and you would have had a gem of a movie.",1016841600,3,1548,4.397212543554007
109373,5,0790740451,"This movie is built on characterizations and macacbre humor. It's not necessarily a romance ""chick flick,"" but rather a detour into dark humor with an idiotic plot. By saying ""idiotic,"" I surely don't mean ""bad."" Actually, this kind of movie is perfect for the odd twists and turns it has.
It's been very misunderstood probably because of the fact that it was clearly marketed as a ""chick flick"" -- and when viewers expecting another cute ""Never Been Kissed"" style movie from the fact that Drew Barrymore is in it -- it gets mostly negative reactions.
It's actually a good movie. Perhaps it's an aquired taste; but then there are movies such as ""Beetlejuice"" that sort of contain the same over the top, macabre humor. And ""Beetlejuice"" was very popular back in the 80's.
A great example of this humor is in place when the mother (Catherine O'Hara) tells one of her two sons that she likes them exactly the same, and holding two fingers a couple inches apart, she says, ""with a difference of this much."" And the plot is none the less actually entertaining. It's kind of fun to know what happens next.
I'd give it 4 1/2 stars, but there is no ""1/2"" so 5 stars it'll be. (Also, the main rating for this is kind of low as well, so why not give it some help?)",1009584000,3,1254,4.4803493449781655
109374,4,0790740451,I saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint. Not even close! This movie is strange and should someday earn cult status. Besides I like watching Drew Barrymore.,1001980800,,298,4.339285714285714
109375,4,0790740451,"It was weird! Half the people acted crazy, especially Luke Wilson's brother and Mama! Besides they both killed their stepfather can you believe it? Drew Barrymore this was not your best at all, but their were still some  sad and funny, and of course cute parts, so most people (if you like Drew  Barrymore, like me) would like it okay.

109376,3,0790740451,"Home Fries is your average movie.  Drew Barrymore does a great job in the movie but what about the DVD?  The colors were nice but this movie is simply average.  This movie is primarily a dialogue DVD if you were  wondering about sound. The DVD is less-than average because there wasn't  many extras in it.  I don't include interactive menus, trailers, scene  access and different language as an extra.  All DVD's should have this.  So, maybe a featurette or some sort of trailers for other  movies...something cool.  Anyway, the movie is a fun average movie.",959126400,5,558,4.768421052631579
109377,1,0790740451,This movie was just way too confusing. The twists and turns were totally out there and not believable (as opposed to a good movie which would have unbelievable twists) If you have to see a Drew Barrymore movie of the  second phase in her career this is not the one. If you think this is going  to be a lighthearted romantic comedy think again. I suggest buying either  Never Been Kissed or Ever After which are much better movies for Miss  Barrymore than this one.,955238400,3,464,4.423529411764706

109394,1,0790740451,"This couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a black comedy.  No matter which it was trying to be at a particular moment the dialogue is CONSISTENTLY delivered in a oddly-rythmed mono-tone mumble (mainly by Luke Wilson but Drew is also guilty). With no sense of tension,  hint of a logical plot, or ultimately even a climax, the movie simply  peters to a bland end leaving one thinking ""WHAT A WASTE OF MY  TIME"".

You really believe how much they feel for each other. It's  too bad they aren't together anymore I think they made a wonderful couple.  You have to get this movie.
