8481133,1,B005OAEWZK,I bought this elsewhere for $20. figured how could I go wrong. First off there are 4 or 5 dvd's in a case and some were loose and scratched. No protective sleeves for the discs.  So I played one of the scratched dvd's first. It played ok but I discovered I wasted my money. The picture is grainy and I have a Bluray upconverting dvd player and that didn't seem to help. Found out these were filmed in 1995. Certainly they could have done a better job transferring them to dvd because I have dvds of programs that predate this series and they are much clearer. Then the music is awful and the script tells you nothing of value. I watched the one about whales and it was full of useless banter about their magnificence but not any useful scientific or interesting facts but there are lots of flowery words. Don't know if I will ever watch any of the others after just watching one....maybe when I am old and grey and have run out of decent things to watch. I am upset that something that could and should have been interesting turned out to be a big snooze. Save your money and find something else.,1318896000,19,1096,4.320388349514563
