8672332,4,B00MHFCAFO,"While the movie is good, imho and I highly recommend it, a word of warning: first, as stated by Amazon, it is locked to Zone B, requiring a switchable Blu-ray player. Second, although the first German movie was published on DVD and Blu-ray with english language, this one was not. I wrote the publisher and got a fast, friendly, but unsatisfying answer, mainly stating money constraints for not putting the english sound/subtitles on the DVD and Blu-ray.
What was not answered, was wether a dubbed english version was even produced for cinema - from the implications in the answer, my guess is not, but I will gladly edit this review if someone has different information.",1429488000,55,671,4.843478260869565
