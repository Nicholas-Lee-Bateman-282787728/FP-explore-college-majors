8667532,5,B00LP6VK4I,"I have studied nutrition for almost 2 decades was extremely impressed with the knowledge and truth that was presented on these DVDs.  Not only are the doctors extremely knowledgeable and straightforward, they are engaging and likable.  The material is presented in 20 minute segments, which makes it very easy to find the time to watch or use as a lesson for my children.  Yet, somehow they pack a vast amount of information in that small time frame!

Also, they come across as genuinely caring for the viewer to be able to reach abundant health in all areas: Physical, Mental AND Spiritual.  The spiritual health aspects shine forth in their use of Bible scriptures to equip and encourage.  Overall:  Well-done and highly recommended!

Eye-opening, engaging, powerful and Biblical!",1414540800,,782,5.102362204724409
8667533,5,B00LP6VK4I,"We started watching these videos as a family a few months ago and they really helped to put us on the right path to a complete lifestyle change.  As I've been implementing what we're learning, and really started making some changes in what we eat, how we think, how we exercise, etc., I have lost 40 pounds so far, and more importantly, I FEEL so much better! I have more energy, and I am setting a better example for my kids and the rest of my family. I still have another 20-30 pounds I would like to lose, but I am learning to treat my body the way I believe my Heavenly Father would like me to. I believe there are so many things God would like to accomplish through me, and being healthier and having more energy for that work is my goal. It's been a fun journey and I encourage everyone to take the time to study and learn from these videos.",1407456000,2,847,4.164634146341464
8667534,5,B00LP6VK4I,"Lessons for Healthy Living 2.0 has been such a powerful tool for our family, that we have opened up our home for a group study with people from our fellowship and anyone who would like to come and learn.
The series is paradigm shifting, and you can go over the information time and time again.  From the perspective of being a believer, it is great to see the teachers connect the learning experience to Biblical principles.
And not to mention, top notch video quality.
We're excited to see what else will come from Drs. Jeff and Andrea Hazim as well as BiblicalHealth.tv

8667536,5,B00LP6VK4I,"I am over 72 years old, living in good health, and always felt that my good health was my personal responsibility first and foremost. Yet these lessons actually provide the big picture of the complexity of this subject, facing the underlying causes that failing health can be traced from. They also deal with modern terminology, like free 'radicals' and 'antioxidants' for example, and what is the role of enzymes in our nutrition. The producers present these lessons in a user friendly and practical way, speaking to people who take their health seriously, yet are quite confused by all the bits and pieces of health information around these days.
My direct benefit from these lessons is the explanation as to why I may need some supplements with my nutrition..",1405728000,2,762,4.9609375
8667537,5,B00LP6VK4I,"My husband came across Biblical Health TV long before I did, and began to institute some changes in our family because of things he was learning there.  It took me a while to get on board (I'm a little bit hard-headed), but when we met Dr. Jeff and Dr. Andrea Hazim, and Dr. Kimberly and ""not-a-Dr."" Chaim Goldman in December 2013, and really got a chance to hear directly from them, and see that they are truly living what they are teaching... it really made a difference.

The teachings in this series are easy to watch, easy to learn, and eye-opening!  Dr. Andrea sure does love her props, lol.  But as a multi-style learner, the visual props help to put the picture in my mind.  We are watching the DVDs as a family, so we are all on the same page.  Everyone knows the why, how, etc., of what we're doing.",1405641600,2,809,4.324503311258278
8667538,5,B00LP6VK4I,"Lessons for Healthy Livivg 2.0 is an absolute necessity for anyone looking to take control of their health.  This information is vital to anyone looking for change and information that you won't receive in the mainstream media.  Allopathic doctors do not want you to know this wonderful, life giving information.  These 24+ 20 minute modules have truly changed my lifestyle and those who I have influence on.  Thanks Drs. Jeff and Andrea Hazim for presenting this knowledge succinctly with passion and enthusiasm.  Thanks ""Not a Doctor"" Chaim Goldman for being such a wonderful host.",1405641600,,583,5.159574468085107
8667539,5,B00LP6VK4I,"Health is a real passion for me and after watching lessons for healthy living I was ready to go concord the world. It was so informative and relative to today's world. When you are try to put health into prospective for people that don't understand the relationship of their health to their relationship with the creator it's a difficult thing. These DVD's help you to know better so that you can do better. Lessons for Healthy Living makes taking the message of health to others easy because it is simple, straight forward, easy to understand and a most share.
Thanks to the team for a job well done.

8667541,5,B00LP6VK4I,"The lessons and teachings contained in this set are truly life-changing. My Wife and I began a journey, about a year ago, to live a healthier life, in body, mind and Spirit...we actively decided that we HAD to do something about the food we ate and how we ate it...the habits that we had become accustomed to. As we watched these short, themed lessons, it all made so much sense...WE COULD DO IT ! ...and we are...what we put into our bodies is what manifests on the outside...as we journey together, we have a desire to walk out our faith in our Creator, in a complete way...in body, mind and Spirit. We have both lost about 30 lbs., each, and walk together, jog together, eat together, spend quiet time with each other, and most importantly, study scripture together. These DVDs will help you transform your life, renew your mind, and nourish your soul and Spirit, if you desire to do so...thank you, Drs. Jeff and Andrea...sincerely, Ron and Colleen Billie.",1405641600,2,960,4.652941176470589
