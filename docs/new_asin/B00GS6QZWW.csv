6106283,5,B00GS6QZWW,So what are the negative review people babbling about!? This movie was a great Friday night scary treat! I love the chemistry between the two leads and the suspense was awesome.,1420761600,5,177,4.741935483870968
6106284,1,B00GS6QZWW,This is yet another POV camera movie with little substance. The story is thin and once again you get a grainy/blurry look at the creature for a few seconds. I'm suppose to believe this huge creature leaves no footprints. These found footage movies have become  a crutch for lazy film makers. I would leave this one alone.,1418860800,,321,4.631578947368421
6106285,4,B00GS6QZWW,awesome,1416096000,,7,7.0
6106286,1,B00GS6QZWW,Another stupid attempt at documentary type movie. No bigfoot shown just sounds in the woods. One of the guys said he saw it but yet never seem to leave footprints in the snow...must be one of the rare flying bigfoot.,1414972800,6,216,4.425
6106287,1,B00GS6QZWW,"Don't know what movie the other people that reviewed this movie were watching but this was far from edge of your seat stuff. The only time I was near the edge of my seat was to turn this piece of crap off. Very predictable, no surprises.",1400284800,6,237,4.173913043478261

8626659,2,B00GS6QZWW,"This movie was awful.  This ""film"" was boring, had poor acting, and terrible dialogue.  I guess when you can't think of a line to use, just throw in a few four-letter words and that works!  Two stars because I loved the main menu layout and design.

Please save your time and money folks.  This movie has no suspense, it basically just two losers camping in the woods and shining their flashlights around at night.  The few glimpses of the creature that you get treat you to a man shuffling around in a lousy gorilla costume with furry fabric hanging straight down his legs like the suit used in Abominable.

This DVD is another one for the burn pile!",1449360000,3,651,4.466101694915254
8626660,3,B00GS6QZWW,"Well, I think I've seen all the bigfoot  foundfootage movies now and I can say this wasn't one of the better ones. However,it is worth a watch as long as you don't have to buy it. Acting is ok. I've gotten  kinda used to only getting a glimpse of the creature{every movie isn't EXISTS,which is a classic)so I knew by the reviews what to expect. Foundfootage fans or bigfoot found footage fans might as well watch it and get it off your list. It is watchable and I give it 3 stars(bigfoot was really good at rockthrowing..lol). It isn't Exists..but it isn't the awful Legend Of 6 Fingers either.",1445040000,7,594,4.440366972477064
