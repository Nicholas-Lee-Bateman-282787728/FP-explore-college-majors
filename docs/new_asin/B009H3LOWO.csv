8541447,5,B009H3LOWO,"There's not much detail in the description of this book/DVD set, so it was a bit of a gamble to get it.  But being a HUGE Rainbow and Blackmore fan, I pulled the trigger - and I'm extremely glad I did!  This is a 'coffee-table' hardcover book - 11""x11"" - that is sturdy, well-designed and quite handsome.  It has four DVDs included in an ingenious individual sleeve system just inside the front cover.  The book is 116 pages long, and is divided into two sections: the first section (the first 70-some pages) is a fairly good history of Ritchie and the band; the second section consists of six lengthy, previously-published (but today rare) interviews - three with Ritchie, one with Ronnie, one with Ritchie and Ronnie together, and one with Roger Glover - chronologically covering the period from '75 to '04.  I found the interviews particularly fascinating and informative, but the history was very good, too, even if not fully in-depth (I did find a few factual errors, but nothing really bad). The book also has quite a few full-size photos of Ritchie and various other band members that are generally excellent.

The four DVDs are structured in the same way as the book: the first three DVDs are the (I believe) previously-individually-released Inside Rainbow documentaries that chronologically cover the history of Rainbow.  They rely mostly on the words of critics and rock historians (all of whom are very knowledgeable, people like Jerry Bloom, as well as Jerry Ewing and Bob Carruthers of the Classic Rock magazine) and some semi-notable friends and fans of the band, though there are also recent video interviews with people like Bob Daisley, Don Airey, Joe Lynn Turner, Doogie White, Bobby Rondinelli, Graham Bonnet, and some others. (The moment where Bonnet admits that leaving Rainbow was a mistake was a bit heartbreaking - very big of him to admit that.)  Ritchie and Ronnie also get to speak, but only in the form of mixed-quality older audio interviews - the one with Ritchie dating back to '75, while at least one with Ronnie being often mislabeled as also being from '75, though it is almost certainly from the early '90s. There's lot of 'opinionizing' by everybody (and some are surprisingly critical of pretty much everything Rainbow did except for ""Rising""), but I personally enjoyed it all quite a bit.  The one downside is that there is no Rainbow music or video on these DVDs, instead just having some generic rock music in the background, and a lot of still photos while people are talking - the licensing of the original music and video was almost certainly too expensive. Some fans have expressed disappointment about that in the Amazon reviews of the individual Inside Rainbow DVDs, but it doesn't really bother me, as I understand what this is all intended to be - a general overview of a legendary band from the various perspectives of original band members as well as some people who love the band.  The fourth DVD is a collection of the fuller interviews used in the first three DVDs, and it's really great to hear Ritchie and Ronnie, as well as see people like Daisley, Airey and White talk about various things related to Rainbow.  They all come off really well, funny and bright.  It's easy to see why Ritchie picked them for the band (in addition to all of their talent, of course).  Each DVD lasts about 40 minutes, so in total it's about two hours and 40 minutes of viewing.

So, there you go.  Is this package perfect, and the last word on all things Rainbow?  Absolutely not!  But it's a great addition to the (far too few) available resources on one of the greatest hard rock bands ever, and I don't think any true fan will regret getting it, especially for only $25.  Definitely recommended!",1378944000,7,3735,4.764341085271318
