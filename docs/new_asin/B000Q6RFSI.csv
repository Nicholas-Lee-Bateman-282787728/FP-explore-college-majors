8194705,1,B000Q6RFSI,"This DVD is useless. It is poorly produced with a mismatch between speech and action on the screen and the content is very poor. I do not recommend.
It will not tech you anything that you cannot learn from the manual or the website of Steinberg. If I could I would claim my money back.",1239148800,,285,4.2
