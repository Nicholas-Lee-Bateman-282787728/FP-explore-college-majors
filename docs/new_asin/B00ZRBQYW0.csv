Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (1956) - Watch this cinemascope (2.35:1) movie in crappy Pan 'n' Scan (1.33:1) with washed out colours. Awesome!!!
Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans (1957) - Watch 10 of the original 39 episodes with variable transfer quality.  You could of course spend the extra $ and get the fully restored complete series from Network releasing in the UK (make sure you can play Region 2 dvds boys and girls).
The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890 (1991) - Probably the best part of this release. It's an OK doco but don't expect too much information.
In short, nothing to see here folks.",1507507200,,625,4.63063063063063
