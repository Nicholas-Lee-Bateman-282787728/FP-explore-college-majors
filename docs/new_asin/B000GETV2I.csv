8131029,5,B000GETV2I,"College is very expensive.  I'm still paying off my masters degree.  These DVDs that Ian did along with some of the others in the Gnomon series offer all the informatio I got in college and more in some cases.  They don't teach you about the business end of illustration but really you just need names of art directors, post cards, stamps and some base contracts of your own if you are working with shifty small companies.  Either way this DVD is a must have.",1341273600,,459,4.428571428571429
