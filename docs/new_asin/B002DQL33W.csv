8365803,5,B002DQL33W,"My interest in Saffire started at a free ""coffee House"" showcase they gave at a college in Allentown,Pa. during the release of their first Alligator Records album. My date,a fan of the Willie Nelson style of country music,had never heard the blues quite like this but by the end of the night she was ready to drive their tour vehicle forever. They had that effect on many women with tales of ectasy, triumph and sadness on life after Betty Frieden. Always entertaining and always truthful,Saffire gained new fans,one at a time. The story told here is compact and effective,like the group themselves. As they wind down their time together(and continue in solo careers),this little film tells the story of three rockin' mamas(four,including one member from their early days)who always left the stage with newly converted fans ready to drive that tour vehicle forever. My date and I have been married for over 15 years and we got to see Saffire many times,and each show was always fun but also renewal of our commitment as a couple. Thanks Gaye,Ann,Andra and Earlene for being truthful and sassy always. As you frequently signed on a CD booklet-Stay Uppity!",1251590400,3,1154,4.923076923076923

The history of these women, their joys, hardships and their uplifting performances make this piece totally enjoyable.",1246579200,3,286,4.916666666666667
8365805,5,B002DQL33W,"I had the great pleasure of seeing Saffire perform live on their current tour. The energy, wit and soul they brought was just amazing. And I'm glad I got a copy of the ""Hot Flash"" DVD because I learned so much about the band in their early years along with all of the funny and sometimes touching stories they told about their careers and lives. And the concert footage from their many shows was so great to see. This is a definite must have for any Saffire fan!",1245801600,2,462,4.261363636363637
