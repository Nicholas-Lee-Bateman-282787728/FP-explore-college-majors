8210418,5,B000TR6I8C,"This film is an absolutely perfect vehicle for that world-class actor, Amitabh Bachchan.  One of his strengths here is that his commanding presence looks so right in the costume that is frozen in time.  ""Eklavya"" is set in present-day Rajastan, but the principality and it's fortress-like palace atop a mountain still has a foot in the past.  The story of the palace guard and what has tainted the life of the noble-appearing man unfolds like a tale from a very old book, a half-remembered dream realized by a very competent director.  Saif Ali Khan and the rest of the cast acquit themselves well but, as is usual in his movies for quite a long time, Bachchan is the driving force.  He's a Titan among the mere mortals, the difference between good and great.

Eklavya is an aging but still very impressive man with a secret.  He has dedicated his life to ""dharma"" or ""duty"", in this case guarding the family of a weak and decadent rajah.  Yet Eklavya has very little to call his own.  Moreover, his eyesight is failing, and he wonders how long he can be useful. .  Sanjay Dutt, who seldom disappoints, does an excellent turn as a low-caste police chief, who has admired the legendary Eklavya since he was a boy.  One day, everything changes at the palace with its Shangri-La atmosphere.  The queen dies under strange circumstances, her son comes home from England, and events begin to unfold that puts the aging Eklavya, the ""man who never misses"" to the test once again.",1507248000,,1472,4.662790697674419
8210419,4,B000TR6I8C,"Having a facebook friend who was a Pakistani Pashtun caused me to be interested in this video.  He suggested it to me, and I found it on ancestry.  I had to have a printout of the story in order to understand it, but it was still very injoyable.  It's nice to see something made outside of Hollywood and have a peek into another culture.",1432425600,,337,4.234375

8210421,5,B000TR6I8C,"Eklavya reminds me so much of The Man in the Iron Mask: the plot of having the heir to the throne fathered by the most trusted bodyguard. While the stories are entirely different, I relished every moment watching the interaction between all the characters. Every single one of them light up the screen and embody their different characters so well that one forgets quite easily it's fiction. My favorite scene is when Jackie Shroff gets thrown over the a train track (don't want too give off to many details). I thought it was beautifully shot like every other scene and rather engaging. It's my favorite because it stands out to me the most. In Eklavya, the emotions, and elements of suspense are not lost. This is where I disagree with a previous reviewer. Eklavya is by no means mediocre.",1227916800,4,791,4.697841726618705
8210422,3,B000TR6I8C,"Eklavya is a story of a royal guard who's faith lies in his duty to protect his master. The old man is played quite effortlessly well by Amitabh Bachchan. The storyline isn't engaging enough and a lot of viewers will complain of the same. The cinematography is beautiful but by the time the end hits you, you lose interest because somehow even though the characters try hard to emote their grief to you, you really do not care. There are few films in Indian Cinema to compare to this one. This film will wrongly be thought to be ahead of it's time and will appeal to a few select base of viewers. For fans of Bollywood, this is quite undewhelming. Watch this if only like me you must give every film a chance. I watched it because it was chosen for Oscars, I doubt it will win, it isn't very long so that doesn't hurt.  Everyone of the actors chip in somehow but not one of those films you'd remember any of the great actors for.",1191715200,,929,4.278409090909091
8210423,5,B000TR6I8C,"This movie is sort of a gloss on Hamlet, Indian style. I thought it was beautifully shot and well-acted. The script is tight, and the only scene I didn't like was the improbable ending. There are stand-out performances from the usual reliables: Amitabh Bachnan, Imran Bomani, Saif Ali. I highly recommend it.",1188172800,3,308,4.9423076923076925
8210424,5,B000TR6I8C,"Every once in a while I stumble across a great movie like this.  Incredible character development.  Eloquent dialog.  Suspense.  Emotion.  The subtitles were translated crudley but the clever dialog still came thru.  One key is that ""Baba"" means Father.  That wasn't clear till later in the movie.  Pay close attention to the dialog and all the double meanings.  I would put this right up with Dr. Zhivago.  I would buy a new copy if they can get a better translation.  I rarely see movies I consider good, so this one really stands out.",1185062400,6,537,4.666666666666667
