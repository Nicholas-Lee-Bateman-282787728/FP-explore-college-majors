Great stories by and about her by herself and fellow actors. It's also really raw and honest. 80 minutes well spent. Felt like not a minute of it was wasted.",1403308800,11,310,4.0
6302037,4,B00IXD2N1K,"""Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me"" (2013 release; 80 min.) is a candid and intimate look at the legendary Broadway star, now age 86. As the movie opens, we spend time with Elaine as she goes about her business at her apartment in the Hotel Carlyle. Elaine is gearing up for another show, ""Elaine Sings Sondheim"" and we watch her at the rehearsals. The documentary contains tons of testimonials, including James Gandolfini (RIP), who quips ""if we both had been 35 when we met, I'm sure it would've resulted in a torrid love affair that ends badly. I love that woman"", ha! Someone else refers to Stritch as ""a Molotov cocktail of savvy, madness and genius"", and that about sums it up for me.

Yet the documentary is not just one long ode to Stritch. Indeed it doesn't shy away the darker side, showing Elaine battling diabetes and alcoholism. When asked point blank what she fears the most, she answers ""drinking"". The other challenge she battles is to remember the lyrics of the songs she is to perform, be it during the rehearsals or during the show itself. It all leads up to Elaine's performance at the Town Hall in NY.

The documentary also contains a bunch of archival clips, including Elaine performing on a TV variety show in 1955, yes almost 60 years ago, but also her unforgettable speech at the Emmys some 10 years ago. Kudos to director Chiemi Karasawa, a veteran in the film industry but her debut as a feature director. She is able to bring us an honest portrayal of an aging (""I'm older but don't call me old!"") Elaine Stritch. I can only hope I have the same energy and enthusiasm for life, assuming that I even make it to 86.

This documentary opened last month at one of the art-house theaters here in SW Ohio, and the late matine I saw this at was PACKED, believe it or not. ""Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me"" is an enjoyable documentary and worth checking out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1396742400,38,1902,4.523255813953488

6302051,3,B00IXD2N1K,"Famous Broadway actress / singer / dancer / comedian is shown ages 85 to 88, looking back in her Manhattan digs as she prepares for a new Sondheim show, actually a cabaret act using his songs. many celebrities offer insightful cameos.

Seems she is quite self aware: she never struggled financially (?), coming from patrician Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and marrying very successful men. But this awareness does not seem to extend to her performance life, where she has endured some real flops. was she ever a raging beauty , a great actress, a great singer? Her eccentricities ultimately keeping her at a distance?

This is a very deep portrait, as we get views of her from the '50s, '60s, in the recording studio, agonizing over flat notes; in a hospital bed around 2013.  I am glad I watched this all the way thru: Stritch fans buy it now. This casual fan will donate the DVD to the Library.",1447545600,,894,4.6455696202531644

6302053,3,B00IXD2N1K,"Broadway legend Elaine Stritch, who passed on last July will be primarily known as a stage star, although she had a few film and TV appearances. This documentary covers her last active years from 2012 and 2013. She had gained success on TV by playing the elderly mother of Alec Baldwin's character on the hit sitcom 30 Rock (there are a few behind the scenes from the show which went off the air in 2013 the same year she officially retired. It also shows her doing of her last cabaret acts at the Carlyle singing Stephen Sondheim songs (oddly enough none of her COMPANY and FOLLIES songs are showcased in the act). There is an archived clip from Company: Original Cast Recording documentary of her most famous song ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" which has become her signature song. It is strange to hear her sing ""I Feel Pretty"" at 87 though! She talks about her career and there are a few clips from her past movie and TV clips. (oddly the Oscars left her out of their In Memorian montage, although she did appear in a few films including the 1957 version of A FAREWELL TO ARMS with Rock Hudson (whom she had a brief affair with) and Woody Allen's SEPTEMBER. She also won an Emmy for her one woman show ELAINE STRITCH AT LIBERTY (which is available as an abridged DVD and there was also a documentary on HBO that has yet to be released on DVD). Among those interviewed are Hal Prince, George C. Wolfe, James Gandolfini (probably of his last before his untimely death in 2013), Nathan Lane and her behind the scenes crew. It also talks about her health crisis, she had been battling alcohol addition and diabetes for many years. They could update this with a segment on her death (she had been dealing with stomach cancer at the time). In all a good documentary and a found farewell to a Broadway legend.",1440460800,,1798,4.484756097560975

What a dame, that Elaine! I loved the mess out of her and will always cherish our one-time ""real"" to the heart conversation we had. What an honor it was for my husband to spend time with such an awesome woman that gave her heart and soul to the theatre; for him to be chosen to work for her in her home, until her diabetes worsened and she needed professional assistance, was a wonderful experience that he often refers back to and will never forget.

6302075,5,B00IXD2N1K,"Loved Elaine Stritch from childhood when she would pop up on TV. I thought she was glamorous, funny, inteligent, and truly whitty. This video is a crafty mix of performance, archival film/video, interviews, anecdotes, and the occasional walk on the dark side. Sort of a raucous and almost a too candid person, Stritch discusses her struggles with booze and diabetes and a career that lasted almost a lifetime until her passing in 2014.
There were a few things that surprised me on a personal level about ES, but this came out at the time of her death. I hadn't seen this film until November, 2014.  I always assumed she was never married, but she was married to an actor named John Bay, who coincidently was an English muffin Bay. She was a Detroit native and she went back to Birmingam MI to be with family before she died. She studied with Erving Piscator. She loved many people and many people loved her as evidenced by the interviews included in this doc. She was also frequently seen on television in the '50's and '60's.
This DVD was very interesting as well as fun and very cleverly assembled. Yes, ES was quite a dame and quite a performer. I loved the intimate feeling of this DVD and was pleased that it captured her toward the end of her long and productive life.",1423180800,,1274,4.539130434782609

my entire life.  I couldn't have been luckier, and I will miss
her forever.

The director, Chiemi Karasawa, has made a flawless and
seamless work of art with this film.  I was never aware of
any intrusive camera work - it's as if there were no camera
at all, and that is truly a rarity in documentaries.

I can only say, knowing Elaine as well as I did, since she
was so unique, so brilliant, such a consummate performer
and dazzling human being, that I feel really blessed to see her in this film.

Her courage and battle with a serious form of diabetes, her strength and honesty
both in her work and privately, her mind-blowing timing and unbelievable sense of humor,
her fragility and kindness, her astounding life force as she prepares for her shows -
we learn many life lessons from this great and remarkable lady.

Chapeau!",1417910400,,884,4.528301886792453

Aside from that, it is extremely entertaining and interesting on too many levels to mention here... Needs to be seen many many times. I don't think Stritch could tell a lie if she tried.

6302103,4,B00IXD2N1K,"Elaine Stritch, that gravelly-voiced, long-legged, larger-than-life singer/dancer/actress and Broadway legend, died less than six months after the release of Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me, a documentary made when she was 86. At an age when most other performers have long since called it quits, Elaine Stritch went soldiering on, clinging tenaciously to the one thing that gave her life purpose and meaning - performing on stage in front of a loving and devoted audience.

Director Chiemi Karasawa and her crew follow this grand dame of the stage around Manhattan as she preps for a new one-woman show, chats with friends, poses for pictures with fans and passersby, and speaks, with often brutal honesty, about her life, her career and her views on aging and death. Needless to say, her outsized talent and personality shine forth through every single moment of the film.

On a personal level, the movie chronicles her struggles with alcoholism and diabetes, her marriage to John Bay, the one love of her life, who died of brain cancer in 1982, her affair with Ben Gazara, etc. Karasawa interviews a number of celebrities - Nathan Lane, the late James Gandolfini, the cast of 30 Rock, among them - to get a sense of what it was like to work with Stritch on a professional level. The movie buttresses this with a veritable treasure trove of photographs showing Stritch at various stages in her life and career.

The movie doesnt shy away from showing the difficulties and diminished capacities that come with aging. For instance, there are moments of tremendous tension as Stritch becomes increasingly temperamental and irascible, struggling to do things now that came so easily to her in her youth (i.e. remembering lyrics during rehearsals and sometimes even performances). There are times when she even comes across as a bit of a diva or curmudgeon, going so far as to direct the documentary itself, molding a particular scene to her own liking.

The fact that Stritch died not long after the filming of the movie makes watching it now an especially poignant experience, as what was initially intended as a tribute has now become an elegy.

One of her non-celebrity friends describes Elaine Stritch as a Molotov cocktail of madness, sanity and genius. That pretty much sums her up, all right.",1414540800,,2290,4.968668407310705

As with Joan Rivers Piece of Work, there's a downside of seeing stars up close and it's not just without makeup, you see the pettiness, the rudeness and most of all, the charm that keeps them going and keeps us going to see them. She's not without her faults and when speaking to the camera after the credits, you wonder if she's lost it mentally. Still, it's good fun and mostly good fun to see her so happy, mostly on stage and not off. I am sorry that she's gone but glad we have this record of her. Hard for filmmakers to keep up with her for sure. RIP Elaine.",1412726400,,741,4.225352112676056

But she was a remarkable actress whether on Broadway, movies, or Tv, and we have little parts of her to fondly remember, even though it almost breaks you heart to watch it. A much better record of her career is the documentary Elaine Stritch: at Liberty. I recommend you see if first because as old as she was getting, she pushed and pushed her self to be fablulous in everything she did. And she accomplished so much.

Strich was always best in very small doses, like wasabi and tabasco sauce. Having once seen her in performance, I never had any reason to wonder why she sank the two musicals she starred in. She was ideal as a jaded, bitter loud-mouth, but Noel Coward was hopelessly delusional in thinking that audiences would accept her as a romantic leading lady. COMPANY gave her her ideal role: a few wise-cracks and one acerbic show-stopping song. Slam-dunk. As for this DVD, if you adore her, buy it.

It was amazing to see that someone who had performed thousands of times still get so nervous and scared before performances but pushed though.

6302190,5,B00IXD2N1K,"Getting ready for another of her one-woman shows, ""Elaine Sings Sondheim"", Elaine Stritch oozes moxie and personality, and this is just in her rehearsing.  If you know even a little about Broadway then you will know about Ms. Stritch.  Here, director Chiemi Karasawa shows us the woman during all stages of her life and performing career in a more intimate collaboration.  We are privy to her very private side, one that I wasn't expecting, but thoroughly enjoyed viewing.  Not everything is 'coming up roses' for Stritch although with her strength of character, when they do come up, she will grab them - thorns and all.

So much of the narrative by Stritch is a reflection on her life concerning feelings about the way things are for her now, and the struggles she has left behind her.  She speaks openly about the love she had for her husband which could not be replaced after his passing.  The ""one person"" she felt she could always trust.  This appears to be an intensely important issue with her; trusting the people closest to her is imperative for her to work with any one of them.  She drives this point home a few times in this study.  While her candor is a large part of her, so is her vulnerability along with some insecurity about ""getting older"" (""never old"").  Grappling with diabetes causes health problems that tax her memory which, in turn, can make it difficult to remember the lyrics of Sondheim.  We see this mainly during the rehearsals; on the stage is an entirely different story.  She commands her audience, her comedic timing is impeccable, and then rightly so, receives grand reviews for her ease in performing to the packed houses - over and over.

Stritch talks about her television role on 30 Rock, and I am probably the only one who has never seen the program.  I will now.  Her fellow performers weigh in, but her two cents are more than regarded as she goofs a bit with them.  James Gandolfini also adds another thought onto adoration that you need to hear straight from him.  Along with her comes such respect and admiration for the woman and performer that she is.  She speaks about her trouble with alcohol and apparently, when asked, this is the one thing that scares her the most; ""a drink"".  We see her celebrate another birthday while watching the documentary and hear of her long-term plans, that is if she does decide to make any of them.  This is one lovely lady who is still on the move, yes, ""still"".  She may not be too fond of the word itself, although for me, it only shows how amazing and resilient she has been for the long-haul ...

**I am so sorry to have to include this update; Elaine Stritch passed away on July 17th, 2014 in her home in Birmingham, MI at the age of 89.  After viewing this documentary and getting to know more of her admirable life, my heart broke upon learning this very sad news.",1404604800,20,2854,4.56188605108055

6302193,5,B00IXD2N1K,"Rob Bowman, Elaine Stritch's Musical Director for 14 years, says at their first meeting, Elaine told him, "" you have to be brutally honest with me, that is the only way I know I can trust you!"" And, that seems to be the real Elaine Stritch. Over and over Elaine and her friends, colleagues relate the truth and honesty she shared.

I first heard of Elaine Stritch when I saw her in a Broadway show, 'A Little Night Music'. I had heard of her and seen some of her work before, but never really heard her. Marvelous, electric performance. And, here, in this documentary, Elaine shares her real life, warts and all. Elaine is 89 now, 88 when this documentary was made. She was rehearsing for her latest show, singing the songs of Sondheim. With her age and her fragile diabetes, she was fighting many battles. She would forget her lines, low blood glucose. Rob Bowman would need to run off and find her orange juice and prunes or pure glucose. At one point in the Hamptons, she became very ill, she was visibly afraid and agitated and was hospitalized.  We follow her as she rehearses for the show, we see pictures and hear stories of her past life as she prepares the pictures to be shown in an honorary room at Stella Adler's theatre.  Her friends, colleagues comment off and on, and we learn of the love that Elaine has for these people and theirs for her. Stories are humorous, but mostly the real life shows through. Her husband, John Bay, the love of her life. Her other loves throughout the years.  In the end, Elaine decides the time is right to move home to Michigan where her family lives. She is there now, recovering from a surgery for cancer.  She is not eating according to Liz  's daily gossip column. I hope Elaine fares well.  A true talent.

This is a fabulous documentary. Everything is shown, indeed it is riveting. Elaine leads the film as she does in real life.
She's still here!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-29-14",1404000000,20,1936,4.5243553008595985
