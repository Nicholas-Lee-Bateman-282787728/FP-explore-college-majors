8111890,5,B000ENUKTO,Alot of people don't like the gt series i think its actually good just because akira toriyama didn't work on this one its still his work!!,1254787200,,138,4.346153846153846
8111891,5,B000ENUKTO,"This is one of the best animes that I have ever seen. If you really like anime then you should really check this series out along with the Dragonball Z series. There's tons of action and great storylines in this. Although Dragonball GT didn't quite hold the epic value that the Dragonball Z series had, it's still a really great series. Dragonball GT is the culmination of the entire Dragonball saga.",1209340800,,400,4.647887323943662

8111893,4,B000ENUKTO,This is easily the best saga in the Dragonball GT series.  It had more action than any of the other sagas.  This dvd set has 17 episodes which includes the whole shadow dragon saga.  It had a lot action and it all wrapped up into a ending that was that great and unexpected.  This dvd set has everything a Dragonball fan could want.  It  has great moments such as Vegeta finally becoming a super saiyan 4 and has the strongest villan ever in the Dragonball series.  I recommend this set first before you get anything else. The other three sagas are good but not as good as this one.,1180137600,,582,4.284403669724771
8111894,3,B000ENUKTO,"The last saga of the Dragonball GT series seems to be more thought out than the rest of the anime. Out of Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT, DBZ was my favorite out of all of them. Dragonball Z is a power trip, but more thought out. Dragonball GT seemed rushed and not as good of a storyline. The ending of the Dragonball GT series has an ok ending. I can not say it had a good ending, because through my eyes, it seemed a little bit easy to beat the ultimate Omega Shenron.",1168732800,2,484,4.159574468085107
8111895,5,B000ENUKTO,"This box contains the final episodes of Dragon Ball GT. These episodes are known as the Shadow Dragon Saga. I am a huge fan of Dragon Ball, Z, and even GT.  I don't like Gt as much as the other two mainly because of the horrible musical score and holes in the storylines, however my one exception to the bad storylines is in this saga.

Ever since Goku met Bulma all those years ago they gathered Dragon Balls and made wishes.  Although the wishes were almost always for positive things, negative energy was introduced into the world and was stored inside the Dragon Balls themselves. In the Kid Buu Saga of Dragon Ball Z, Elder Kai warns Goku and Vegeta not to use the Dragon Balls because they could upset the natural evolution of the universe. Partly due to this fact, this storyline in Dragon Ball GT is acceptable.  They were already hinting at this in Dragon Ball Z.

The idea of the ultimate good becoming your worst enemy is brilliant.  Because the humans relied so heavily upon the Dragon Balls, the negative energy inside of them was released in the form of a Black Dragon.  This Dragon thus creates Seven Dragons each created from a specific wish.  This is the one hole I can't tolerate in this storyline, each Dragon was only made from one wish, but they completely skip over some wishes such as reviving the humans after the Cell Games.

Still, despite this the Shadow Dragons themselves are entertaining and the fights are good even if they are mostly centered around Goku. When only one Shadow Dragon remains, he absorbs all the other Dragon Balls to create the most powerful villain in Dragon Ball histroy. All is not lost however because with help from Bulma, Vegeta has ascended to Super Saiyan 4.  Can our heros stop this final evil from destroying the universe?

In the end, Goku vows that the earth will from now on get by without having to use the Dragon Balls.  A final scene where Shenron appears without being summoned was absolutely wonderful in the dubbed.  He says that the true beauty of the Dragon Balls was knowing that you lived in a world where you didn't have to use them.

Then the Dragon Ball storyline ends with a glimpse into the future as an elderly Pan watches her grandson, Goku Jr., and Vegeta Jr. fight it out at the World Martial Arts Tournament as Super Saiyans. At the Tournament there is a gigantic statue of Goku symbolizing all of his noble deeds.  Suddenly Pan thinks she actually sees Goku watching the fight, but never actually sees him.  The last scene of the story shows Goku walking away and clips of how our heros destroyed every villain including Frieza, Cell, and Kid Buu.

So that's it for the Dragon Ball storyline.  It was a wonderful ride and it changed my life.  I love the shows and in my opinion this is the greatest anime ever.  I'll wrap up with the final episode title of the show by saying, Until We Meet Again!",1157587200,7,2880,4.523166023166024
8111896,3,B000ENUKTO,"I have to give this some props... it is the end of the line afterall.  I actually bought this one, I'm not really sure why, but the prices have dropped slightly on this box.

Plotholes were less apparent, but Toei is still treating Son Goku like a god!  As I've said on the first two box sets, Son Goku's Super Saiya-jin 4 is treated like it can take down anything.  I think it changes Goku's attitude...  In Dragon Ball Z, Goku would give his children every chance they got to fight.  Here, Goku believes that he can do anything by himself as long as he has Super Saiya-jin 4.

The plot here is rather confusing...  In the past 37 years since Goku and Bulma first met, the Dragon Balls had been overused.  Causing negative (minus) energy to build up inside the Dragon Balls.  So when Goku and company decide to summon up Shen Long, the negative energy bursts and a dark dragon comes out that splits into 7 negative dragons.  The Kais immediatly blame Bulma for the unavoidable destruction of the universe since she created the Dragon Radar.  Bulma then blames her bodyguard for 37 years, Son Goku!  Goku realizes he is responsible, if he hadn't taken out all of those monsters, everyone would've forgotten all about Bulma's silly dream.  Goku then takes on every single dragon one-by-one, each one becoming stronger than the next.  When Goku finally fights the last dragon, he absorbs all of the Dragon Balls and becomes the ultimate enemy!  Bulma creates a new device to help Goku and Vegeta, the blutz waves.  Vegeta turned into a Super Saiya-jin 4 and Gohan, Trunks, and Goten ressurected Goku for one last fight!  With the entire universe behind them, Goku and Vegeta fight to the finish with Omega Shenron.

Perhaps one big plothole is the fact that the blue dragon that came out of the Dragon Balls was never killed.  He didn't even fade away, he flew into the sky.  Some wishes in the show were overlooked.  Every single wish supposedly created a Shen Long, in the course of the show, the dragon was summoned at least 10 times.  With the number of wishes increased in late DBZ, it would make nearly 14 wishes granted.  Vegeta also runs out of energy much faster than Goku did.  Another case of Toei treating Goku like a god.  In the beginning, Vegeta was considerbly stronger than Goku.  Vegeta was always stronger until the very end of Dragon Ball Z, but Goku was just barely stronger.

Individual disk bashing, the extras on the disc are rather scarce.  The box says Textless Songs, when only the opening is textless.  The menus were rather lame, most of them being lame cutouts of of Son Goku and the dragons, just recolored.

Dub bashing.  The ending was pretty terrible in the dub.  The FUNImation dub had the usual background music playing as a bunch of clips started playing.  These clips were originally silent to give an ominous goodbye.  In this dub, the clips has the original lines added in.  We really could go without the GT Rap playing as Goku says his final good-byes as well...

Dub positives.  The script was pretty close this time around...  The names of the dragons are pretty cool, too.  It was kind of lame how all of the dragons were named after the stars in the original anyway!

Positives.  So, its the end of an era, what is there to say?  I loved this show, I've grown up with it, being only a toddler when Dragon Ball Z came out and loving it ever since, this terrible show became more... sentimental you could say.  The plot wasn't all that deriative because it wasn't all based on faulty fillers from the first two sagas.

I guess the only thing left to say is.

Good Bye Son Goku!  Until the Day We Meet Again!",1151971200,4,3649,4.526073619631902
