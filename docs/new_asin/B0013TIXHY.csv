3119278,4,B0013TIXHY,"Good quality sound, it was as advertised and it arrived promptly.  The packaging protected the guitar and the appearance was flawless",1356739200,,133,5.333333333333333
3119279,4,B0013TIXHY,"This is a great dvd for beginners.  Of course nothing beats a real instructor, but this is a great alternative if you want to learn guitar at your own pace on your schedule at a fraction of the cost.  The first chapters do alot of thorough explaining and show alot of step by step examples.  I know absolutely nothing about guitars or reading music off charts or tabs.  This dvd explains everything a beginning guitarist needs to know about charts, tabs, and chords.  However certain areas get very very advanced quickly.  If you're a slow paced learner like me this can be intimidating.  Just go over previous lessons over and over till you feel comfortable before moving on.  If you listen to the lessons and follow them exactly, this dvd will help out alot.  Remember you get out of it what you put into it.  This dvd has ALOT of info for new guitarists.  If you are more advanced the instructor Mark John Sternal has a series of lessons on dvd of all types. Hope this helps.",1348272000,11,978,4.468926553672317
3119280,3,B0013TIXHY,"The teacher starts you off slow and shows you all the basics for playing the guitar.
There are gaps in the teachings that leave you asking more questions but for the price its worth the time spent there if coupled with other teachings on the guitar.",1324944000,5,249,4.434782608695652
3119281,5,B0013TIXHY,i have other dvd from the same artist and from the others that i looked into this guy is the best and the easiest to understand. he tells you how to do it on a level that even a first time user can understand,1297296000,12,208,3.75
3119282,5,B0013TIXHY,"I am a new guitarist and this is the third dvd I have tried.  So far I am very happy with this one! The first day I learned about chords, tabs, and tuning by ear! The previous dvd's left me very frustrated.  This dvd however, answers all my questions, goes more in-depth, and is just the right speed for me.  Two thumbs up!",1267747200,19,323,4.095238095238095
3119283,5,B0013TIXHY,"Not sure about the previous reviewer. This DVD is certainly a Region 1 (plays in US & Canada). It plays in my home Sony system, my portable player, in my truck player and in my Dell PC.

As for the content, this DVD teaches everything a beginner would want to know and more. The parts of a guitar, playing 1 string at a time and building up to all 6 strings, showing notes and building chords and in the end teaches 5 songs. Perfect for a beginner guitarist!",1243987200,18,458,4.204545454545454

My computers wanted me to change my DVD player software format to something else (SE Asia, Australia or China), not sure which.  Would have returned the disk but fortunately have a portable player that I use on airplanes, and it plays all formats.",1238803200,,381,4.478260869565218

8252779,4,B0013TIXHY,Some good stuff for a beginner,1471996800,,30,4.166666666666667
8252780,5,B0013TIXHY,This was a gift for someone else.  Was good,1443830400,,43,3.7777777777777777
8252781,3,B0013TIXHY,OK but personally do not like the style and presentation.,1428019200,,57,4.8
8252782,5,B0013TIXHY,Easy to follow. Progress quickly. Very informed lessons.---10,1421971200,,61,6.75
8252783,3,B0013TIXHY,I purchased this item because it was considered a good choice for a biginner.  I have to disagree.  I think the information within is relatively sound.  It was Not easy to follow.  Was well boring.  This item has been used once for this reason.  Again Good content.  However Not exactly exciting in any way.  Nor did I find this to be good for a begging guitar player.,1415318400,2,368,4.388059701492537
8252784,1,B0013TIXHY,its like trying to teach algerbra to a first grader,1411862400,,51,4.2
8252785,1,B0013TIXHY,"Not for beginners, no instructional guidance!",1409788800,,45,6.666666666666667
8252786,4,B0013TIXHY,"This DVD is better than taking lessons in a class, or even one on one with an instructor because you can pause and replay anything you didn't quite catch. It is extremely detailed and comprehensive. I haven't even played it all the way through, but after watching a bunch of YouTube videos and even trying a beginner's class, this DVD was the best instruction I've received.

HOWEVER - it is supposed to be for accoustic guitar, yet the instructor plays exclusively electric. The information translates perfectly for a student of accoustic guitar, but it's annoying to hear the notes being demo'd coming from an electric instrument instead of an accoustic guitar. I was going to return it, but it's really good and hasn't stopped me from learning a lot.",1403395200,4,753,4.837209302325581
8252787,5,B0013TIXHY,Wonderful item for a everyone who loves guitar everyone should have this in their collection for those who are beginning to play.,1387065600,2,129,4.909090909090909
