849478,5,630434855X,"While ""L'argent"" and a number of Bresson's other films dance around the issue of the void and the consequent immunity of the lucid individual to any form of hope, ""Le Diable"" confronts it head on.
Charles, an apathetic, negative, yet somehow compelling young man walks around Paris with his 'friends' (he has no real contact with them) and searches, a bit lazily, for a meaning to live in a society which offers none.  Horrific shots of environmental destruction and human deformities resulting from pollution give an added impact to the film.
In the end, however, Bresson's focus is Charles--his miserable and joyless hedonism, his situationisteque responses to the outside world's demand for him to 'act', and his seemingly unabating feelings of alienation and despair.  The dry, realist tone of the film is Bresson's abrasive answer to our demand for drama in the questions of metaphysics Charles' unspeakingly proposes in his behavior.  Bresson knows that in the actual world no one would care or give the time of day to a young man of Charles' age with these kind of questions.  The paradox of the film is that Charles is an unsympathetic character in terms of his relations to others.  And yet we have nothing but the utmost sympathy for his nihilistic (or not?) plight.  The attractive leading actor is literally able to enact man's tenuous place in the universe with a few downward glances.  Of course, all attempts to save Charles are in vain; he is looking for truth, which is nowhere to be found.  He toys with suicide and in the end opts for a mercy killing via a junkie friend he has a strange empathy for.  While one would doubt that anyone cares enough anymore to sacrifice their own skin for the sake of a universal truth, it is both numbingly depressing and exhilarating to see on film.  Charles takes on the character (keep in mind, this is *cinema*) of a kind of saint of revolt through his last act of despair.  I would say that while this film would be nothing for most people, it would be everything for a few.",1086652800,9,2032,4.711864406779661
849479,5,630434855X,"With a cool, quiet narrative tone & an absence of any theatricality, Bresson presents a series of tableaux involving a group of young people who confront evidence of danger & evil in the world. The tone is of  disaster & imminent disaster, without redemption. Whether in  hollow  words of politic rhetoric or psychiatry, or in images of ecological  disaster: the destruction of forests & oceans, atomic annihilation. The  central protagonist is a figure who is unable to conform his despair:  Outside of society & social mores he articulates his alienation &  his nihilism. As with other Bresson films, the protagonist ultimately loses  himself & in doing so attains a state of ""grace"" through his  passage of suffering & loss.",963187200,6,727,5.042016806722689
849480,5,630434855X,"Beautiful poem of being in the world and not knowing why, seeing evil and being powerless to respond.  Like most of Bresson's later work (Lancelot, L'Argent), when the film ends it is a kick in the gut.  Bresson just walks  away.",960163200,6,229,4.536585365853658
7868583,5,630434855X,"The main character in this movie, who is 'more intelligent than the other ones' is confronted with political, psychoanalytical and religious gibberish, the misuse of scientific discoveries for the fabrication of deadly weapons (atomic bombs), economic (unrestrained growth, drugs) and environmental (pesticides) catastrophes, ridiculous police interventions and relational difficulties (real love is impossible).

Faced with a devastating human habitat, the 'hero' of the film can only choose the ultimate solution, in the ancient way.
This movie (a formidable uppercut) should not only be characterized as a masterpiece, but above all, as a very serious wake-up call for all human beings, and, in the first place, for its fundamentally diabolic masters.
For Robert Bresson, man himself is the devil, and not probably. His destructive actions are nothing less than a global planetary suicide.
A must see.",1461196800,2,904,5.696296296296296
7868584,3,630434855X,"Robert Bresson's 1977 meditation on the state of the contemporary world The Devil, Probably (Le diable probablement) is his twelfth and penultimate film. After his detour Camelot-way in Lancelot du Lac (1974) the film posits the same bleak and nihilistic agenda this time through the story of a group of students in Paris who are presented as products of a society which is sick to the very core. There was a time when Bresson's protagonists were predestined to receiving grace, even if they had to go to prison to attain it. That died out with his adoption of color from Une femme douce (1969) onwards, and The Devil, Probably amounts to his bleakest, his grayest, his most cynical and his most critical work. Indeed, there is a whining, hectoring edge to proceedings which shows him at his least likable and least approachable. Bresson's films exist on an extraordinarily high level of achievement and are essential viewing for the most part, but I found watching this one a wearisome experience.

Ignoring his usual lofty sources (Diderot, Tolstoy, Bernanos, Dostoyevsky), Bresson adapted The Devil, Probably from a mundane newspaper article. At the beginning we learn that a student has been found dead in Pre Lachaise cemetery in Paris having either committed suicide or having been murdered. The following 90 minutes detail the last 6 weeks of the student's life. Named Charles and played by Antoine Monnier, he is the intelligent son of rich parents who recoils from the society that surrounds him with his friend Michel (Henri de Maublanc) and two girls, Alberte (Tina Irissari) and Edwiga (Laetitia Carcano), the first of whom the two men share the affections of. Charles attends student anarchist meetings and university classes where he learns about what 'they' are doing to 'us'. Cue extensive footage of oil spills, nuclear tests, seal culling, deforestation, waste disposal sites, insecticides being sprayed on crops, cars dumped on waste ground, the effects of lead poisoning on kids, aircraft fumes poisoning the ozone layer, and the rest. In short we have the whole green agenda which in 1977 was still relatively new. Charles' worldview is crystalized most clearly when he takes a session with a psychiatrist. He admits he is intelligent, possibly more intelligent than most around him, but because society is fundamentally wrong with governments lying, companies profiteering and with no clearly defined prevailing sense of morality, be it Christian or otherwise, to study and succeed means contributing to the evil that surrounds him. By doing 'nothing' he is therefore doing society more good than doing 'something'. Charles' solution is therefore to commit suicide, or at least have a friend do it for him. No life is better than bad life and bad is what the human species is according to the director. We cannot solve the problem if we are part of the problem. Bresson seems to suggest that his death will be followed (should be followed?) by all our deaths in a future completely void of hope.

At the time Bresson's point of view seemed hugely impressive and when the film won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival that year Rainer Werner Fassbinder no less stood up and declared: ""Robert Bresson's Le Diable Probablement...is the most shattering film I've seen this Berlin Festival. I think it's a major film [...]. In the future - and this world will probably last for another few thousand years - this film will be more important than all the rubbish which is now considered important but which never really goes deep enough. The questions Bresson asks will never be unimportant"". That may well be true, but the message conveyed in the film is one that has been repeated many times over since (sometimes more skillfully) so as to make it seem a clich. Looking back with hindsight, viewers now will recognize the importance of the message, but will be bored by its repetitious attacks on familiar targets, especially when the attitude Bresson adopts (reinforced by his usual dour mise-en-scne, use of amateur 'models' who are forced to look expressionless throughout, avoidance of humor, and disregard of any hope whatsoever) remains so resolutely misanthropic. As I have stated in my other Bresson reviews I am a huge admirer of his and find even his other bleak color films (especially Lancelot du Lac and L'Argent [1983]) to be masterpieces. This one however just doesn't do it for me. I don't mind the director's anti-commercial stance, a stance which suited him well down the years, but in The Devil, Probably he states his grim case with implacable force in a direct even simplistic manner which smacks to me of propaganda. Unlike his other color films which force us to think deeply and interact with the texts in a meaningful way, this one leaves no room for that so that we feel goaded into supporting its dogmatic left-wing agenda. Whether we agree or not, basically speaking I do not like being told how to think and I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Bresson devotees will find plenty of the usual compensations in this film. The film's conclusion is telegraphed at the beginning as per usual telling us the fate towards which the main character is headed. Narrative tension is sacrificed so as to focus us on the reasons (the process) rather than the result. Bresson time and again points his camera into empty square spaces (usually door frames, stairways and vacant rooms) into which characters enter as if predicting a program which has already been mapped out. Grace may have disappeared from the film, but the characters still echo the Catholic predestinarian Jansenism which was always Bresson's main reference point. With cameraman Pasqualino De Santis Bresson continues pointing his camera downwards, catching characters' legs and hands rather than faces - again 'process' is more important than result. There is also the usual disregard for psychological character motivation. We don't know why Charles moves from woman to woman or why he elects to help a drug addict. We don't know why Alberte leaves Michel for Charles, much less why she returns to him. These are all narrative questions of zero importance to the director, intent as he is on showing us that it doesn't matter what the characters say or do, their destiny will be no different. Coming to this film from the very best of Bresson (which I take to be Diary of a Country Priest [1950], A Man Escaped [1956], Pickpocket [1959], Au hasard Balthazar [1966] and Mouchette [1967]) we recognize the film language at once, but realize the sympathy amply shown for characters in those films is absent here. Finally the film constitutes an end-game not only for the characters, but for the whole of western civilization as well, a civilization which Bresson sees as fundamentally doomed. This is not a scenario that anyone can feel comfortable with. That may be the point, but the film's one-dimensional misanthropic harangue is a million miles away from the subtlety of his best work.

Artificial Eye's presentation here is good, the pictures (aspect ratio 4:3 - 1.33:1) sharp and the sound (Dolby Digital Mono) clear. As with most of their Bresson releases there are no extras, a disappointment when the film itself is short (95 minutes). Perhaps a commentary and an intelligent documentary would make the film more interesting. Frankly though, this is a film for Bresson enthusiasts only. For others its appeal is rather hard to gauge. Perhaps some people will trust Fassbinder's judgement over mine. You'll have to buy it and find out for yourself, or perhaps you could test watch it on YouTube first.",1411430400,5,7612,4.977219167321288
7868585,1,630434855X,"I'm giving this one star for the same reason the first reviewer did.
I was luckily able to see this (and every Bresson film at a retrospective years ago) and I can certify that New Yorker has excised scenes from this film, the obvious one being the baby seal clubbing during the scenes of environmental stock footage carnage. I remember it because it was the most shocking thing I'd seen! When I bought the VHS of this title on New Yorker, that scene was noticeable
excised. I can't think of anything more profane than a company ""monkeying"" with the very precise and specific structure and formula of a Bresson film! New Yorker should be ashamed. Sincerely!
I agree with the first poster, I'm hoping this and all of Bresson's color films get the ""Criterion treatment"". Save your cash buying this sinfully neutered version!",1403222400,7,822,4.755244755244755
7868586,5,630434855X,"The choice of Antoine Monnier to personify the character Charles says a great deal about the genius of Robert Bresson !  No actor could in any way replace what Monnier simply walks through .  The entire film almost desperately depends on our understanding the problem that Charles is trying to deal with ---- that is --- how to escape from a life that offers everything he might desire but simply doesn't care for.

Bresson devotes most of the film depicting the casual, disparaging, hedonistic and sometimes frenetic lifestyle of his unwilling victim and then has him visit the ""famed"" analyst who ends by advising Charles just how the Romans dealt with this age-old problem some 2000 years ago ! Charles is enlightened and acts on this advice to put an end to his own suffering.

Really, not much more need be said about this film other than that it is close to perfect and stays away from needless detail.  One either understands Charles or chooses not to.  Most would probably choose the latter but shouldn't really blame the ""cinematographer"" for seeming to somehow sympathize with his creation !  ""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.""",1387929600,,1167,4.747524752475248
7868587,5,630434855X,"Bresson's canon is completely insane. The number of great films he made but also, the combined intensity of those works is dazzling.

This film is probably more timely today than when it was made. It's like looking back into a prior, pupal stage of collapse from a vantage point the author clearly saw. The whole point of this film is that it's not about the subject, Charles, or whatever his name is. It's truly a meditation on the degree to which all who are coming out of the chute, such as it has been shaped, are doomed. There are so many great sections in the film, but the one about the environment is probably the most powerful: as usual Bresson fetishizes the sound of saws, and the thud of trees hitting the forest floor. Like Faulkner's ""Delta Autumn,"" this is a world eating itself but so lost in its own dream of power that it can't tell that dinner is being served from its own hind quarters. The only salvation is to submit to one of a number of practitioners who can help you join the ranks of the ignorant (in return, of course, for a princely sum). This is not subject shifting, it's subject irrelevance as a consequence of the systematic machination of fixed outcomes, serving masters who never appear (likewise L'Argent, Bresson's breathtakingly brilliant final work).

That said, some of what the other reviewer, who complains about late Bresson, claims cannot be denied, but you pretty much want to look past it. Not necessarily to the ideas, but to a deeper sense of tragedy, more like the original Greek version, before Euripedes, where the viewer is not invited to 'identify' but rather to participate.",1343260800,2,1627,4.685314685314685
7868588,4,630434855X,"Though I hesitate to use the archaic language of religion, on some level I saw Charles (this film's protagonist) as the spirit sputtering and fading in inhospitable times. Through him we see a spirit which is loosened from its moorings and exploring. He looks into the possibility of finding a way to live which includes retaining his integrity, but the world will not let him do both and deep down Charles seems to know what the outcome of his search will be before it reaches its conclusion. He is keeping half an eye out for something that is worth his attention and his time - for something that he can invest himself in, for something that will make his life worth living. He encounters and half heartedly engages with, political activism, spirituality and love. The dialogue that revolves around all of these is somewhat insipid and hollow and I felt as distant and as bored as he seemed to while watching much of the film. It's as though the world in which he attempts to live is a lake polluted by waste burbling out of the pipes of industry, and he simply can't stomach diving into it. So he skirts around the edges of his life vainly seeking fresh water.

Though 'The Devil, Probably' deals with ecological themes, I felt that the real pollution here was to be found in what people were saying. Language swirls through this film like mustard gas. Whether it came from the mouths of the members of a Marxist political group, who Charlie dismisses as idiots. Or the pages of a 'lifestyle' magazine which seems to map out a future for him that he detests. Or from his mathematics college lecturers who are smart enough to understand nuclear physics but allow there efforts to fall into the hands of people who will use them to build ever more spectacular ways of blowing people up. Or members of the clergy who listlessly go through the motions of promoting a God who even they don't seem to believe in anymore. Or from Charles himself, who talks about his own supposed superiority and steals from grocery stores as well as stealing his friends girl without remorse. My favourite example of this semantic pollution came from a psychoanalyst who offers words of wisdom such as: ""Do you know that the feeling of being crushed by the society that you live in might well be the result of that spanking you got a a child? That, together with the painful dream of being murdered for a good cause, would point to the development of psychomotor symptoms and explain the root of your disgust and your wish to die."" This kind of Orwellian language conceals more than it than reveals and has an aura of authority while at the same time managing to be misleading or meaningless. Perhaps Robert Bresson would agree with the notion that: 'those who don't know say and those who don't say know.'

Given this films themes, you would expect it to be full of anguish but it isn't. All of Bresson's characters seem to react and interact primarily with their intellects rather than with any kind of passion and they seem to be half in the land of the living and half in the land of the dead. I'm reminded of Descartes words: 'Without the passions, the soul would have no grounds whatever to remain joined to the body.' I suppose that the impassivity could be seen as a Buddha-like lack of attachment, or as a comment on the film maker or artist as watchful bystander, or as an antidote to the way in which most contemporary culture bypasses our intellect and appeals directly to our baser emotions, but its an approach that makes Bresson's films difficult to engage with. Charlie does sometimes show an acute sensitivity at least - while he waits in a car and trees are being cut down with chainsaws around him, he can't bear to listen or watch and he puts his hands over his ears. But without passions or even interests to anchor him to the material world he begins to float away like a paper cup in a freezing winter breeze.

The camera is static throughout much of the film and many of the scenes would make excellent photographs. The sense of stasis is also highlighted (by way of contrast) in a sequence in which Charles catches a fish and he and his friends are delighted by its spirited struggle for survival. The police arrive to enforce a no bathing rule and Charles and company hide in the long grass by the riverbank. In a rare playful moment they play hide and seek with a policeman but the fun can't last in '...a world where egos are measured with tabloids, where automobiles double for morals, where beliefs are like naps - you leave them behind when somebody touches you and in a place where oil always takes precedence over life...' as Anis Mojgani put it in a poem.

Like most people, Charlie's friends are more pragmatic than he is and manage to make compromises but he simply can't adjust to such a flawed world. As he ducks out of commitments and enumerates the bitter virtues of doing nothing, the trajectory of his life slowly and inexorably begins to resemble more the Indian proverb: 'It is better to sit down than to stand, it is better to lie down than to sit, but death is the best of all.' Relenting to his friends suggestion he goes to see a psychoanalyst who inadvertently gives him, by example, yet more evidence of the irredeemably vain, superficial and money grabbing nature of contemporary society. Charles tells him that his problem is that he sees too clearly and the analyst offers some clumsy analytic babble in return but he does at least give him a useful tip about how to kill himself. In a way he takes the analysts rather predictable counsel that instead of being concerned with or trying to fix the reality that we share he should struggle to fix himself - he does indeed fix himself, once and for all. When his end and the end of the film comes, I didn't see the martyrdom of a saint because Charles already seems to be somewhat corrupted. He is arrogant for example, and because he can't beat them his future would seem to be one of joining them or else of despair. To live in despair is to live with a feeling of emptiness and as Bresson said: ""...there is something which makes suicide possible - not even possible but absolutely necessary: it is the vision of the void, the feeling of void which is impossible to bear."" It's as though he had been set the thankless task of attempting to light a candle underwater.

Perhaps his assessment of his prospects was correct and perhaps he was better off hitting the ejector seat and bailing out of this world before he became something that he hated. But I can't help thinking that the world needs more people like Charles in it, now more than then (in the late 1970's when this film was made) and that perhaps we should consider not sacrificing them to our hollow Gods.

Their very awkwardness (while not as horribly counterproductive as in L'Argent) may be the point, but while it does draw attention to ideas over performance and people, it also keeps you at more than arm's length. Parts of it work - there is a great scene on bus that gives the film its title as the various passengers join in a conversation positing that its not government but the masses who unthinkingly, unknowingly dictate policy - but perhaps more don't, leaving you with a film populated by people who believe in nothing that it's hard to care about or, more importantly, engage with its ideas or its pessimistic worldview.
