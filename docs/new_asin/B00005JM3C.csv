1482378,5,B00005JM3C,"Once again, here is yet another CLASSIC television series coming to DVD, which I watched as a child. Now, I know that most of you are thinking, ""yeah, it was cool as a kid, but as an adult, I know it'll just be korny.""! Well, that may be true, but it's coming nonetheless! And I can't wait! I bought the entire Space: 1999 series. I also bought both sets of the UFO series and I plan to buy the complete S.W.A.T. series! All I can say is: BRING 'EM ON PEOPLE! I'll take anything I can get to bring me back to that simpler time called ""childhood"". DVD's ROCK!!!",1058832000,20,560,4.146788990825688

1482638,5,B00005JM3C,"The original epic series is my fave.  I even enjoyed Galactica 1980, the follow up series.  I never cared much for the much praised remake.

1482754,5,B00005JM3C,"So far have only watched first disc but it was like being in 1978 all over again, just less the Farah Fawcett poster.  Battlestar was TV's answer to Star Wars and it did quite well for two seasons.  For the time the acting was fairly good and hard to beat the Colonial Viper launch scenes.  Overall a good add to my vintage TV shows collection.  Sure beats the overly dramatic remake which is utter feldercarb.",1513123200,2,410,4.426666666666667

1482827,4,B00005JM3C,"Maybe one of the most memorable Sci-Fi series in the late 70s And 80s. I remember seeing the movie. When it was first released , In a movie theater in tokyo. I was still in the second grade back then. Later in the 90s i saw the Movie again on VHS tape. It was a different style from star wars which i was familiar with at the time. There were robots that were like stormtroopers. with chrome armor. Called cylons.  After the movie, episodes were produced. There were a lot of good episodes. Another movie was made. Mission Galactica : Cylon attack. It was two episodes put together into a Feature film, The living legend and Fire in space.  Which i saw on VHS, Sci-fi channel later showed a marathon of the series on TV. I was able to watch the show.  I saw this Special Edition at borders during my trip in Chicago. Later I ordered the box set.  Its very nice . A good way to commemorate the series. A crome silver box with a cylon helmet. And the title on sides. A collectors book describing each episode. And the DVD set. Containing about 7 discs. It was a great series. I plan to watch it.  Its a good addition to my DVD collection.",1501718400,,1136,4.2407407407407405

1483010,5,B00005JM3C,"I was a kid when the original Battlestar Galactica came out.  I loved the series then.  Now that my kids are teenagers I wanted them to see the original, but unfortunately, the series is not shown on tv.  I saw it on scifi several years back, but it has not been on since that I know of.  I found this and decided to order.  I am glad I did.  The show is most definitely dated, it came out in the late 70's, but the transfer was good for being a 1978/79 tv show.  My middle son loves the show.  He is a sci fi buff and gets a kick out of this old stuff.  He does rib me about some things, but I get a chance to explain to him how, for its period, this show was actually quite a trailblazer.  Now I need to find my old drawings I made of the Battlestar and vipers to show him that I was not a half bad artist back then!",1493164800,3,818,3.78698224852071
1483011,5,B00005JM3C,"Easily my favorite science fiction TV show ever made! I like the newer version as well but this was the one that amazed me when I was a kid in the 1970's and still attracts audiences od all ages to this very day. An all star cast with names you will easily recognize like Lorne Green(Bonanza) and Dirk Benedict(A-Team). This epic TV series is full of interstellar action with gunfights, spaceship fights, and special effects galore! Much like other 1970's shows and movies this was years ahead of it's time in terms of special effects and scenes. Star Wars came out at nearly the same time back then and everyone was amazed by the special effects in that as well which are pretty similar. I would call Battlestar Galactica the ""Star Wars of TV."" Star Trek Voyager and Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda are pretty similar as well in that there is only one major human spaceship/warship for VERY long periods of time that must defend themselves without any help from Earth or otherwise. Andromeda had some episodes when Battlestar Galactica, the newer version guest starred making it a crossover of Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica once again proving that this scifi TV series will be loved for decades to come! Once again, special effects that were unheard of for the 1970's(until Star Wars) are this show's specialty. This is an absolute must have for your scifi collection and is one of the best scifi TV series of all time!",1492905600,13,1422,4.737903225806452

I have to mess with the forward and reverse buttons on my remote to get past these areas on this disk. Also, as a first time watcher of this series, it seems to me that there is missing segments of the series. Say I watch DVD # 3, and go to DVD #4, and the story has jumped to something completely different than what I was watching on the previous DVD...??? Just makes me think that something was left out....

If not for these two issues, I would give this four stars. Under the circumstances, I can only give it three stars.",1489968000,,615,4.082644628099174

Amazon have nothing to do with it. They did their part perfectly. On my request they delivered through high priority shipping even though I was charged for standard delivery which I opted for. DHL delivery was great as well. They delivered 2 days ahead
Some key specks about the product :- Audio Dolby digital 5.1. Video in NTSC 1080/24P. It can't be bettered. The show is 38 years old but its audio video is enhanced for 2016. The quality is not like a HD movie but is damn close. I highly recommend it as this is the best DVD format that you can get for this show",1477872000,,715,4.343283582089552
1483300,5,B00005JM3C,"I vividly remember my older brother and I watching ""Battlestar Galactica"" when it originally ran, and we loved it. Children of the 70's and 80's we cut our teeth on ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"", and to us, this was the weekly version of ""Star Wars"". The Cylons were the perfect blend of scary and flat out cool. The Galactica looked awesome, and the Vipers were just awesome.

Running just 24 ""episodes"", the original series explored some cool ideas, and featured cutting edge special F/X for the time. It created heroes with ""Starbuck"", ""Boomer"" and ""Apollo"", and who didn't want a wise leader like Lorne Greene's ""Adama""? And as cool as the heroes were, the villains were even better. The Cyclops-like electric eyed Cylons with their robotized vocals, and the evil human turn-coat Baltar, plus assorted other villains introduced throughout the show, kept me glued to the screen.

I was a bit worried about re-visiting the show, as I had such wonderful memories of it from childhood, I hoped it would ""hold up"" to my adult viewing. It does.
While a lot of praise was given to the ideas presented in the 2004 re-boot of ""Galactica"", quite a few of the ideas were presented here first. Granted, not in the same way, as the original series seemed aimed at a younger audience, but still the seeds were there.

If you fondly remember this show, you owe it to yourself to give it a re-visit. If you're only familiar with the rebooted series, give the original a try. Yes, it has it's fair share of cheesiness, but the core of the show is so good, it should just add to the fun.",1477612800,,1571,4.5836298932384345

1483427,5,B00005JM3C,"One of the best science fiction fantasy action adventure shows ever made for television, & movies.  Looking back on it now I realize this show really was remarkable, and had something more profound to it's theme then other ""Star Wars"" level fantasies or shows of its time (& ever since).

  The Y2K era remake series, with all of it's political correctness tied with an R rated more adult theme really was bad and in my view will NEVER be the real ""Battlestar Galactica"" series.

 They say this series was cashing in on ""Star Wars""'s success, and was a rip off when in reality the franchise has very little common themes other than space men engaged in warfare and special effects.  BSG was it's own unique thing, and it brought the elements of political-military WW2 style action drama with a ""wagon train through the stars"" western concept.  Its creator the late Glenn Larson was a Mormon, and the show does have some Mormon ""Christ Later-Day"" themes in it but still remained very enjoyable, and acceptable for most audiences.

 The primary characters who make the show believable are Lauren Green's Adama, and the rogue space-Marine pilot Starbuck.  Bring in the absolutely gorgeous Jane Seymour as a widow with her little boy, and the show really shines.

 The robotic creatures, similar to Arnold's ""Terminator"", the ""Cylons"" are on a mission of destruction and conquest.  They represent tyranny and despotic evil, while our heroes represent people who desire freedom and justice searching for the lost planet Earth.

 The only tragedy was this show was short lived, with it's second season premiering in 1980 where a group of new heroes do find Earth and defend the planet clandestinely because mankind wasn't ready to receive alien visitors.

 Wonderful series with big thumbs up, and an A+",1462579200,,1797,4.933333333333334

PLEASE READ THE REST OF MY BATTLESTAR GALACTICA REVIEW IN THE DEFINITIVE EDITION (BLURAY).

1/23/2016 AFTERWORD
THE CANCELLATION OF THE EXCELLENT BATTLESTAR GALACTICA TOS IN 1979 WAS A TRAGEDY. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, LIKE SUPERMAN, STAR TREK, AND STAR WARS, PERFECTLY SHOW US THE NATURE OF THE BATTLE OF GOOD VS EVIL. CONFIRMING THE TEACHING OF THE HOLY BIBLE THAT THERE ARE ABSOLUTES! ANY PEOPLE THAT REJECT THE HIGHER POWER OF GOD AND HIS COMMANDMENTS TO TREAT ALL OTHERS AS YOU WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED, REPRESENTED IN THIS SERIES BY THE SHIPS OF LIGHT INTRODUCED IN ""WAR OF THE GODS,"" AND THAT SUPPORT SATAN'S HATRED, GREED, AND DECEPTION, REPRESENTED BY THE EVIL COUNT IBLIS, HAVE NEVER NOR WILL EVER LAST. THEY WILL BE DESTROYED. ALTHOUGH THE SHORTLIVED ""SECOND SEASON"" GALACTICA 1980 IS ENTERTAINING, IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT US LOVERS OF THE SHOW NEEDED A BETTER ENDING.  SO AT THE TIME, I, JUST A BOY, WROTE A GREAT ENDING! MY VERY FIRST BOOK!

While most box sets have deleted scenes, this one has plenty of those along with outtakes, clips before the special effects were added, shots of the cast getting ready for scenes, etc. I'm frankly amazed anyone saved all this stuff as you usually don't find many extras in series from this era.

My only complaint was that the pilot episodes looked grainy. I was worried this would be the case with the whole series, but the rest of the episodes looked terrific. If you loved the original Battlestar and hated the remake like me, this is a must have.",1433808000,12,616,4.5

1484214,4,B00005JM3C,"I had not seen this program since it originally aired. I was surprised to discover that it only ran for one season (unless you count the horror that was Galactica 1980). The premise wasn't a bad one, but individual episodes could be bad: the cowboy one, the medieval one, the giant cannon one, etc. Star Trek TOS had stupid plots too but perhaps because Battlestar Galactica ran fewer episodes the bad ones really stand out. It is also obvious when you watch ALL the episodes in a short time as to just how few special effects shots of the spacecraft were taken. Perhaps if the program had a longer run it might have had an opportunity to shine. Still, it had some interesting episodes and is certainly worth watching if you are a sci-fi fan.

The overriding weakness that I remember from this show, even as a kid, was how the Galactica was leaving all the small human settlements they came across every week to their fate: ""Hey, well, we gotta go and find Earth now. By the way, there are a bunch of walking tin cans which will probably show up in a couple of centons... they want to kill every human they come across. Well, good luck!""",1427068800,,1137,4.440191387559809

This series was on the same time as Star Trek.  Sci-Fy fans should include Battlestar Gallactica characters and aliens in their festivals and such.

The metal cylons were distinctive- much more realistic than the remake. I liked the characters who had distinct personalities and were not politically correct stereotypes. The civilizations encountered in the journey had some very interesting cultures that differ from anything here on earth.,1412380800,,439,5.197183098591549

1484768,5,B00005JM3C,"By today's standards the special effects for the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" are, well to put it bluntly, kinda cheesy.
  That said, the story lines, the writing and the acting were pretty much top notch. They had to be or the show wouldn't have survived half a season given what was then the nascent ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" fandoms that were already growing in sophistication with respect to  plot development, continuity and, yeah, special effects. There are many reasons to love the original but, for me, perhaps the most important is the earnestness in which the stories were written and told. Gene Roddenberry firmly established the notion that science fiction should not only be about science but also about the human experience. He put Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the Enterprise into situations that reflected his times. So did the creators of the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" and that, for me at least, makes this series a valuable addition to my video collection.",1407801600,,990,5.024390243902439

1484824,4,B00005JM3C,"I was not born when Battlestar Galactica first came one tv I saw the reruns on the old SCIFI tv, I fell in love with it immediately, the series has transferred ok but a few episodes like Experiment in terra, and fire in space definitely show their age. The sound is ok but one or two episodes do sound muffled for a few minutes but then come back ok. Alot of these episodes are really good story wise but you can definitely see these were made in the 70s like in fire in space you can see the wires holding up Apollo and starbuck. Still a great series which lets face it was cut off too early. The extras are ok, the 45 minute doc remembering Battlestar Galactica is great for new or old fan alike, the docs about the cylons and the creation of BSG with glen Larson are ok and the previews of the BSG series and game from awhile back are ok but we already know what came of them both.

The Dolby Digital 5.1  sound is much better than the Dolby Mono 2.0 with less sound. The picture quality is kind of fair 50% if you don't mind the picture being dark  while watching on TV.

1484984,3,B00005JM3C,"As a cult classic, I expected more. I expected something...epic. What I saw was something from the 70's. A lot of over emotional acting, characters that were fairly one dimensional, writing that left a LOT to be desired, story logic holes that could fit a mammoth, etc.
I think, at the time, it was ground breaking and mesmerizing. But having years of sci-fi flicks and series of better quality to compare it to in my head, this just didn't measure up.

The series is WONDERFUL, and includes special guests in several episodes.  The original, like many others, is BETTER than the remake, and NEVER should have been redone!  (A remake should NEVER be done, unless they are going to somehow improve on the original.  The remake of this series actually had them shooting bullets in outer space, instead of lasers!  THAT ruined the whole remake.  Another screw-up: they made Starbuck a woman, and barely included Boxey.  I personally would've had the kid flying a Viper in an emergency or something, with his father Apollo seriously injured, in the back seat and dying.  With automatic controls, and at age ten ""in training"" as a Colonial Warrior using simulators, it would've made a suspenseful episode.  Too bad it was never done, and the remakers ruined the whole remake.)",1392681600,3,1000,4.92814371257485

The disks are outstanding, the in-depth appreciative (and often hilarious) commentary of Hatch/Benedict/Jefferson was the best part of watching 'Saga' again (and this entire set), but even finer is having the extended television version of 'Saga'.

1485410,4,B00005JM3C,"I remember this series so well from when I was a kid! I was only eight years old when Star Wars came out, nine years old when Battlestar Galactica followed it on TV; now that I have an 11-year-old of my own I am enjoying watching this series with him. It is less challenging than the newer versions of Battlestar Galactica (quite a lot of sex and death in that - maybe something for when he's 16 or so), and we both enjoy the hammy acting, although for different reasons. The words ""frak"" and ""felgercarb"" have definitely entered our vocabulary, not to mention talk of cubits, yahrons, centons, microns, etc.

Watching the series can be a bit dull because the development seems a bit slow at times, the action tame, and the battle/starship/fighter scenes recycled (you're always happy to finally see a new one). But there's no doubt that it was a good high-budget series, with all sorts of great gear, huge sets, and wild Colonial Warrior uniforms (love those brown suede jackets!). Also some of the most beautiful women in TV at that time.

The opening episodes are great because they have the sumptuous Jane Seymour in it (wow!!). She makes the stunning Maren Jansen look dull in comparison (Maren gets phased out of the series in favour of Cassiopia, as well as new arrival Sheba, played by the nasty, but nice-looking Ann Lockhart). I also love the tooth-gnashing, snickering villainy of Baltar, and the series definitely loses momentum when they stop fighting Cylons and encounter flaky villains like the Western Alliance, or run up against wacky desert warriors. There's also a shift in the goofy opening dialogue and the opening credits, ""There are those who believe that life here... began out there!!""

The opening episode is a stunning three-part story that shows the destruction of the colonies and the creation of the rag-tag fleet; it's laced together with one of the better episodes, which shows the Hotel California-like pleasure pit that's secretly a vampire/Cylon kidnap/hunting hole. Yuck!! ""Lost Planet Of the Gods"" is a two-parter that shows the Warriors fighting both cylons and a virus! ""The Lost Warrior"" is a wacky ""cowboy sci-fi"" tale, with Apollo landing on a Westworld that is being terrified by a malfunctioning Cylon called ""Red Eye"" aiding a group of caricatured goons in terrorising the innocent towns folk. Yeah!! ""The Long Patrol"" has our heroes encountering a new world of human villains with their weird prison system, and a young Irish thief who's fleeing them to find a new home for his family. Interesting. ""Gun on Ice Planet Zero"", a two-parter, has that cool dramatic title that you just love, and includes a cool commando squad assembled by Apollo and Starbuck (who else) to take out the ice planet death ray, while dealing with dangerous prison-ship demolition experts, and also funky ice clones. ""The Magnificent Warriors""
""The Young Lords"" is a weird little adventure that includes a nasty gang of kids.
""The Living Legend"" is probably the best Battlestar Galactica story - it features a manic Lloyd Bridges as the legendary commander Cain, and introduces his lovely daughter Sheba, and the minor character Bojay (love that nickname). Cain butts heads with Adama by introducing a daring plan to attack a Cylon outpost and a cylon base that comes with the risk of temporarily endangering the rag-tag fleet. The story is a brilliant example of strategy, with a very cool little ending. ""Fire In Space"" is one of those ""natural disaster"" stories, of the type that were so popular in the 1970s (The Towering Inferno, etc), with the crew battling flames. ""War Of The Gods"", a two-parter, shows the crew of the Galactica pitted against the mysterious Count, a Satanic figure, who no one really knows how to deal with. ""The Man With Nine Lives"" is also a great little episode that brings in Fred Astaire (!!!) as a man who pretends to be Starbuck's father... who then is Starbuck's father!! He's also a dastardly Han Solo-like character who tricks everybody, including the creepy Borellian Nomens - guys with seriously ridged brows and a deadly code of ethics. Very very very weird! ""Murder On The Rising Star"" is a pretty cool episode that shows the aftermath of a Triad game gone wrong, with Starbuck nearly found guilty of murder - until Apollo figures out how to clear his friend's name. Interesting stuff going on there. Very nice indeed (although we're never really sure why the murderer needed to frame Starbuck, rather than someone else). ""Greetings From Earth"" is a two-parter that shows the Galacticans intercepting a space ship with humans in suspended animation, and the strange proceedings that carry on from there, including the Galacticans following the humans to their farm world, some silly politics, a battle, and the entrance of the ruthless Eastern Alliance fascists. ""Baltar's Escape"" is an interesting one - it shows Baltar, the Borellian Nomens and our fascist friends from the Eastern Alliance helping each other to escape the Galactica. ""Experiment In Terra"" is a weird one, with Apollo being turned to white and sent on a ghost mission. Strange. ""Take The Celestra"" is a silly story about a devious co-pilot rebelling against his commander; bad acting and mustache-twirling aplenty here. ""The Hand Of God"", the final episode in this one-season series, is a cool one, showing a return of the Cylons, Starbuck and Apollo's adventure infiltrating a Cylon base ship, and more nuttiness, including the first kisses between Apollo and Sheba. What a man!! And let's not forget that ironic transmission that they receive!!!

The packaging is pretty cool - there's a nice six-DVD foldout set, with a cool little booklet that's full of pictures of the series' cheezier moments, great pictures of Starbuck and Apollo in all their feathered-hair glory, with episode details as well as single pages devoted to important cast members, as well as a nice schematic o the Galactica herself, the Vipers, and the Cylon Raiders. The outer shell resembles a Cylon helmet. Damn cool!!

Bonus features are fairly generous, although I'm not so impressed with the ""deleted scenes"", which are mainly outtakes of scenes where the actors screwed up their lines. No big deal at all.

But there are quite a few featurettes: producer Glen A Larson talking about the series' creation, composer Stu Phillips talking about the intense score to the series, how the Cylons operated, how the daggit operated, a photo gallery and an interactive game; there's also commentary on the pilot show with Apollo, Starbuck and Boomer.

Among the earlier, shorter pieces, the first one is Glen A Larson talking about his fascination with Egypt, pyramids, Erich von Dniken's Chariots Of The Gods, and all sorts of trippy thoughts about what connects our various races of ancestor civilisations, which he observes developed in isolation of each other. ""What if `Heaven' is the name of a planet?"" This sort of trippy plot development emerges in several non-Cylon episodes (and alongside cowboy episodes, like the one with Red-Eye). Drew liberally from mythologies, and mentions how in one of the episodes the Satanic character was revealed to have cloven hooves. Thoughts about evolution, and how perhaps our own job some day - if we do a good job in this life - is to run some planet somewhere. The music director talks about how he made themes for all of the characters, including Boxey, and how themes were repeated, allowing him to do his job week-after-week without imploding. ""Inside Battlestar Galactica"" shows three short videos: working the cylons, working the daggits, and a photo gallery. The first one talks about the Cylons, and how the mirrored armor looked cool, but it was heavy, it reflected the cameras, visibility for those wearing the armour was poor, one guy nearly drowned when he went under water with the heavy gear on, and how the limited visibility (and top-heaviness) meant that a lot of cylons would take a dive and crash around (sometimes topping each other like dominoes - there are several great shots of this). At one point, they ran out of money for new Cylon suits, which may explain why there were so few shots of Cylons in later episodes, as the first round had been destroyed during filming - they were cannibalising parts later on. For the daggit series they showed live shots with the chimp sounds coming out of the daggit. Noah Hathaway talks with fondness for the chimp, Evie, who we see in just one shot without her helmet on. Awwww... There are plenty of cool pics, including 42 of the cast, 24 of the artwork, and 50 of the original models. The disc also includes a trailer for the upcoming remake series, and for the video game.

On the last disc, finally, we get a longer documentary called ""Remembering Battlestar Galactica."" It runs through interviews with many of the cast members, including Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Noah Hathaway, and we get to see how old they are now, and how their careers have faded (outside of Noah Hathaway on The Neverending Story, and Dirk Benedict on The A-Team, I don't think any of them ever worked again). It's a shame for Richard Hatch, because we all rooted for him as Apollo - as square as his character was, he certainly was one cool-lookin' dude.

In the documentary, we learn that 60-70 million viewers checked out the pilot movie for Battlestar Galactica. That's a lot!! The crew describes the pressure that they were under going from pilot to mini-series to full series at the drop of a hat, and how they often hardly had their lines (or re-writes) before they were on camera! Wow!! It must have been a crazy year, no wonder it was not re-newed.

We get to see some of the jokes they played with each other on-set - like one with a viper going backwards for one of Starbuck's scenes!! There are shots of Starbuck's original shirtless love scene with Cassiopea. For the Triad scenes, the guys actually got to play the cryptic outer space game, a pure exhibition of male Colonial Warrior sexuality. The cast talked of Lorne Greene telling the most off-colour jokes. We learn/see that shots existed of the Imperious Leader (and lizard), but they were never used. Noah Hathaway talks about how they gave him beer on set (uncool, actually), and both he and Richard Hatch talks about falling in love with Jane Seymour... awwww!!! Can't fault them there, though - who among us hasn't ever fallen love with Jane Seymour?",1377043200,6,10420,4.888574660633484

1485501,5,B00005JM3C,"I remember watching this show as a child.  I was into space stuff like everyone else due to ""Star Wars.""  BG was very well cast.  Richard Hatch and Lorne Greene were very believable as father and son.  I believe this is the main reason it ""worked"" for me.  The characters were likable and the actors portraying them were the reason for that.  Dirk Benedict was great as Starbuck.  And they had some great guest stars, Fred Astaire and Lloyd Bridges to name a couple.  The writing was good, even though sometimes it was a little hokey.  The overall storyline was that the last survivors of the ""colonies"" were fleeing the robotic ""cylons"" and searching for the planet they believed to be inhabited by the 13th colony...Earth.  Of course they encountered many planets along the way that had humans, so I never quite understood why they couldn't just stop at one of them.  I suppose they thought Earth was far enough away from the Cylons that they wouldn't have to deal with them??  Anyway, although some of the episodes were much better than others, I enjoyed watching a show that brought back great memories from my childhood.  I still can't believe they canceled it after only one season.",1375401600,4,1188,4.681159420289855
1485502,2,B00005JM3C,"I bought this series hoping to watch it with the whole family; we only made it through the first few episodes.

The plot and characters just never clicked with us - we never felt that we cared about them.  Somehow, I feel like the writers expected us to somehow know about these characters or that by showing a few seconds of someone's life that we're supposed to suddenly ""get it"" and care about them.  They failed.

Additionally, the content surprised me.  I thought that since this had aired on broadcast TV several decades ago that it would be family-friendly, but it's not.  It didn't show explicit scenes or anything, but the situations, discussions, etc. are not something that I expected or wanted.",1374883200,,706,4.745901639344262

This is the original I loved as a kid. Mention any of the crew and these are the actors I think of... including Bond-girl Seymour.  It was meant to be a mini-series and was so good it was expanded into a weekly show. Unfortunately, they weren't prepared to produce a weekly series and, after competing networks moved their popular shows opposite Battlestar Galactica, ABC cancelled it after one season.  Still, I'd recommend this to the 2003 reboot fans as well: you can see how several bits of plot and character were initially laid out. This has given me a fresh appreciation for how it was all utilized and re-imagined for the technically superior reboot production 25 yahrens later.",1371513600,,730,4.785714285714286

The Galactica fighters were like that of X-Wing fighters and I believe they were the first before Star Wars came out.

1485658,5,B00005JM3C,"I love both incarnations of Battlestar Galactica (1978 & 2004), but in my opinion this version is by far the best! Lorne Greene is the better Comander Adama. In this version the cylons were made by a reptilian extra-terrestrial species, and not by humans as proposed by the 2004 version. I found the 2004 concept of man making machines that evolve and turning against him, a little played out. Anyone who has watched all the Terminator movies knows what I am talking about. The charachters are refreshing and well cast. The amount of money the studios invested into the series allowed the producers to create episodes that played out like well produced movies: Saga of a Star World, Lost Planet of The Gods, Gun on Ice Planet Zero, and The Living Legend. This series is the best $25.00 you will ever spend. This series was later followed up by Galactica 1980; a show not to well recieved by fans, but I actually like it. After watching both series (BG & G1980), you realize that unlike other Sci-fi shows of its day, the heros do not always go out with happy endings. Watch both series and you will see what I mean. Unlike Star Trek were only the guys in red shirts get killed, many of Battlestars charachters get killed off. Zack, and Serina get killed off in BG. Apollo and Tigh are revealed to be dead in G:1980. Starbuck is revealed to be stranded on a barren planet(G:1980). This really is a good show.",1362355200,2,1407,4.543307086614173

The show starred Dirk Benedict (Face of the A-Team), Lorne Green (Ben Cartwright of Bananza) and Richard Hatch (replacing Micheal Douglas in the Streets of San Francisco for the last season of that show).  The premise was about a fleet trying to find the planet earth before the Cylons find the crew of the fleet of the surviving members of the destroyed planets.  The show was always compared to the movie STAR WARS for its outer space exploits but I'm inclined to liken the show more to the classic David Janssen TV series THE FUGITIVE; just as Dr. Richard Kimble tried to prove his innocence in the death of his wife Helen by catching Fred (the one-armed-man) Johnson with Lt. Phillip Gerard in relentless pursuit, the ""last battlestar galactica"" as Commander Adama put it in closing of each adventure of the series was serching for Earth with the tyranny of the corrupt traitor Baltar and the Cylons out to murder the innocent survivors.

Plus, I don't believe the writers put much thought into where to go with the story upon finally reaching earth.

1485993,5,B00005JM3C,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: THE COMPLETE EPIC SERIES is probably one of the best box sets ever created for TV fans. There are many behind-the-scenes featurettes and a commentary for the pilot episode that is just as entertaining as the episode itself. Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, and Herbert Jefferson, Jr. are your tour guides through the hostile galaxy where the Twelve Colonies of man are destroyed by their enemy, the robotic Cylons.

If you want a perfect set, I recommned this one with the collectible Cylon mask box. A year later Universal re-released the series in a smaller box that fits with all other sets on the shelf with one major issue...the episodes on disc two are flipped. Side A is actually side B and vice versa. If you are perfectionist like me, then this collectible set is the one for you. All of the episodes are here  in the proper running order with excellent sound and video quality and you can't do any better than this for the entire series.

Every episode has a plethora of deleted scenes and interesting insights into how they were created are all in one place on the second side of the 6th disc. For me, the pilot episode commentary with Richard, Dirk, and Herb, is worth the purchase alone. If you have been holding out for a great price for this set, you can find it here on Amazon at a great price.

You can also probably get your copies signed at GALACTICON 3 in Houston, Texas between May 23, and May 26, 2013 when the cast and crew of both the classic and the reimagined series will come together for a huge celebration honoring the 35th anniversary of the original series (in this set) and the 10th anniversary of the new series that was created by Ron Moore. Just visit [...] for more information.

This set is a gem and it is worth owning for any sci-fi fan. In my opinion, it blows STAR WARS out of the frakking universe. It's BETTER than STAR WARS. And that's not a lie!

the good: spaceships, lasers, solid casting, epic story, a solid mix of enough good episodes to overcome the bad ones.

the bad: the original film battle scenes are the only battle scenes and seeing them repeated over and over for 2 seasons gets old.

The series was rushed, even as a child I had trouble accepting that the incompetent Cylons were a serious threat. having episodes that treated the colonials as ""gods"" was offensive, treating science as magic while par for the era is also annoying, the 2nd seasons writing went downhill rapidly, most likely due to the constant fear that the series was going to be cancelled.

THE PRODUCT: Double-sided discs cause many problems with playback. 1/5
TOTAL RATING: 3/5

I remember BSG from my youth and the show has held up remarkably well over the past 30+ years. The special effects are on-par with Star Wars. The writing is, well, less than stellar, but each programme is captivating entertainment and, frankly, there are far worse SciFi shows out there. The show had a lot of promise, and it is a terrible shame that it did not continue into further seasons in which the characters may have been given the chance to develop into more than two-dimensional cardboard cutouts.

Be forewarned that this manufacturer makes these discs in double-sided format, which is often plagued with many problems. This is the second set of DVDs of this show I have gone through, and side B of the third disc will simply not play, so I cannot discern if the B-side is blank or has material but is defective. Furthermore, the sets were shrink-wrapped and not factory-wrapped, the discs had fingerprints upon them, which, in all, means that I twice received sets which were used, defective, rewrapped and resold *as new*. This is shameful, and those responsible should be roundly reprimanded. If possible, make sure that what you purchase is FACTORY-WRAPPED, and not shrink-wrapped.

1486123,5,B00005JM3C,"at first glance, it would appear that the great science-fiction tragedy of the past decade or so was the uninspired ""reboot"" that put Battlestar Galactica through the ringer. the true miscarriage of justice, though, was the colossal tidal wave of thoroughly undeserved critical acclaim which actually reached the point of repeatedly stating (not simply implying, but stating outright) that the original was a best forgotten piece of crap. all i can say is, i hope all those critics enjoyed whatever they bought with their payola.
because make no mistake: Galactica Mk. II was/is the most laughable, misguided attempt to fix what ain't broken since the New Coke! it never even tried to recapture the spirit, the HEART, of it's ancestor.
(if there's one thing more shameful than misrepresenting a piece of crap as a masterpiece, it's misrepresenting a masterpiece as a piece of crap!)
the word that best sums up the newer version is hip, and ""hip"" doesn't necessarily gel with science-fiction at it's finest. why do you think the devotees of Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, etc., are stereotyped as ""geeks""? because to be cool is to follow and adhere to what's trendy, and the province of sci-fi is deeper, more philosophical matters than that.
the original walks that fine line much more expertly. maybe it is a bit dated and doesn't always disguise the backlot so well, but it makes up for that with rigid attention to story and character. (maybe the newer one tries to as well, but it doesn't do much good when your characters aren't even the least little bit likable.) it assembled fine actors - Lorne Greene, Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Herbert Jefferson Jr. - into a crackerjack ensemble that could feed off each other. the reboot corralled a completely random bunch who's characters would ultimately have no individual charm, much less collective ""chemistry.""
and while i certainly applaud any advance in women's lib, there's reasonable limits to everything. converting one or two characters into women is one thing, but half the friggin' cast? they took it to far for it to feel like anything but an attempt to curry the feminists.
the writing of the original might've strayed into cliche' from time to time, to say nothing of noticeably gearing itself to a ""family"" viewership as per the norm at the time, but it managed to engage and charm in spite of these potential limitations. if nothing else, it's storylines are always coherent and comprehensible. the reboot's writing is so pompous that it might as well be bishop's lecture, not to mention so convoluted that it might as well be in Sanskrit.
in a nutshell, sci-fi fans were handed a textbook bill of goods. please don't let a bunch of dubious critics who were obviously bought off mislead you. don't let the delightful adventure-for-adventure's-sake Galactica stated out as be eclipsed and forgotten in the wake of the disrespectful bastardization perpetrated by Edward James Olmos and Company.

1486128,5,B00005JM3C,"Battlestar Galatica (1978-1979) is my favorite science fiction television series (the original Twilight Zone not withstanding).  Although heavily influenced by the original Star Wars (even apparently employing some of the same modeling and concept people), BSG stand out well on its own.  The regular cast had excellent chemistry.  And the guest stars include well known actors ranging from Fred Astaire to Lloyd Bridges to Patrick McKnee to Jane Seymore to Ray Milland.  Although certain technologies are dated and some episodes rather cheesy, the special effects were revolutionary for television at the time (the sheer cost of the series is often stated to have led to its cancellation despite its popularity).

The DVD box set itself includes deleted scenes and documentary/interview material which will surely be interesting to fans.

Below I will give my thoughts on specific episodes.

1.  Saga of a Star World--The original and highly imaginative pilot.  The robotic Cyclons have climaxed a thousand years of war with a genocidal sneak attack on 12 human worlds.  The surviving human warship Galatica leads a fleet of civilian survivors through galatic minefields and political power plays on a voyage to a rumored 13th planet called Earth.  Although there are some slow moments, the pilot had good special effects, excellent guest stars (Seymore, Milland, etc.), and introduces many of the main characters.

2.  Lost Planet of the Gods--A two part episode that is Jane Seymore's last.  The human traitor Baltar (John Collicos) and his mechanical Cyclon advisor Lucifer pursue the Galatica to the planet Kobol.  Meanwhile most of Galatica's male crew are dangerously ill which leads to the introduction of women fighter pilots.  Very well done episode although the ending is the most tragic of the entire series.

3.  The Lost Warrior--BSG meets Shane (literally the plot is that close).  Apollo (Richard Hatch) is temporarily stranded on a western style planet with a cylon shootist as the adversary.  Fun episode but nothing spectacular.

4.  The Long Patrol--Interesting and fun episode set on a long forgotten prison colony producing an alcholic drink.  Note the Irish sounding accents of the stranded colonists.

5.  The Gun on Ice Planet Zero--the Galatica is trapped between an approaching Cylon fleet and a pulse weapon on an icy world populated by human clones, a cylon garrison, and a brillant if misguided scientist.  The only option is to recruit prisoners experienced in artic conditions to help destroy the gun.  Fun episode (this one also has a good novelization counterpart).

6.  The Magnificent Warrior--Watchable but mediocre episode involving food shortages and a tribe of tribal pig-like creatures.

7.  The Young Lords--I am not certain whether to find this episode funny or hilariously bad.  Starbuck finds himself on a medieval/viking style planet helping child warriors rescue their imprisoned dad from cylons in a castle.  This episode is rather fun if cheesy.

8.  The Living Legend:  My favorite episode.  This two parter features the Galatica discovering another surviving battlestar commanded by Lloyd Bridges.  Full of space battles, well acted, and also noted for introducing Anne Lockhart's character Sheba.

9.  Fire in Space:  Enjoyable episode in which the Galatica is severly damaged by Cylon kamikaze starfighters.  Much of the actions centers around saving the burning Galatica and rescuing those trapped by the blaze.

10.  War of the Gods:  Another 2 part episode and one of my favorites in which Patrick McKnee plays Count Iblis.  This character is in my opinion the best villian of the series and the only supernatural villian.

11.  The Man with Nine Lives:  Memorable episode with Fred Astaire as the guest star and featuring the Nomen assassins as villans.

12.  Murder on the Rising Star:  Starbuck is framed for murder.  This episode combines a detective story with the BSG plot.  Actually pretty good in my opinion even if not particularly original.

13.  Greetings from earth:  Oh no!  Although it begins with an interesting ethical situation, this episode is the only one I can say I do not like.  Hector and Vector make me cringe and the human characters are not that enjoyable either.

14.  Baltar's Escape: Entertaining prison escape episode combining several villans from previous episodes.

15.  Experiment on Terra:  Interesting Episode in which Apollo and the Beings of Light helps prevent a nuclear war on a planet with a cold war style situation.

16.  Take the Celestra: An entertaining tale of mutiny and pride in space.

17.  The Hand of God--Unintentionally the final episode of the series.  Thankfully it is one of my three favorites.  It offers interesting possibilites of how the series could have gone as well as features the only direct clash betwen the Galatica and a Cylon Base Star.  The ending is both hopefully and badly ironic.  Well done episode.",1332374400,4,4930,5.189808917197452
1486129,5,B00005JM3C,"My DVD's came in far sooner than they were projected to. Brand new condition, too. The new lower price should make it easier for fans to see where their favorite new SF show came from.

1486130,4,B00005JM3C,"I was introduced to the series when I was 15, it came on the SCI-FI channel (not syfy)back in the late 90's. I remember my Mom telling me it was a poor man's Star Wars, but since I already liked Star Wars, so I would give this show a shot.

So lets start with the basics: Overall as far as story goes, the really good episodes are:
Saga of the Star World (pilot episode)
Lost Planet of the Gods pt. 1-2
Living Legend pt. 1-2
War of the Gods pt. 1-2
Hand of God

Which to be honest, every fan of this series are going to say that these are the best episodes, they're not wrong, it just there are some good ones in between that you should check out to like

The Long Patrol
Fire in Space
Heck you can throw in Guns on Ice Planet Zero pt. 1-2 and
Murder on the Rising Star

Sometimes that plot can be thin in some place, and lets be honest, not big on continuity, its one of those cases that if you over think it, you won't enjoy it, so if you really want to enjoy this series, don't think about it, just watch!

Second the acting is what you can expect from a '70's tv show, full of melodrama and pretty hair,annoying extras annoying kid actors, and even more annoying daggits, but I give Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, and Herb Jefferson Jr. their just dues. And I have much love for Lorene Greene, he truly was the anchor for the other actors around him.(I had a  major crush on Richard Hatch, the green eyes had me, and the triad uniforms offered great titilation for a pubecent 15 year old girl.)

Third the special effects are impressive for a show with made with stone age techniques, you can tell when the production ran out of money because some of the scences of the vipers flying repeat over and over again.  You are just wishing that they would do something new.

Overall despite the camp I enjoyed myself, just like I did when I saw the show the first time and I enjoyed it again many years later as part of my DVD collection.",1330300800,3,1935,4.18010752688172

The week the series was cancelled, the cast and crew had just finished production with an episode, yet the ABC Network big shots declined to put it on the air. This ""Final"" episode was featured in an 1990 TV special with Dirk Benedict (StarBuck) as the host. The ""Final"" produced episode was about StarBuck and a Gold-Leader Cylon Warrior both shot down and crash landed from a space battle, injured, and stranded together on a frozen planet. The two have to work together to survive. StarBuck survives, yet the Cylon dies. It was a really good episode, I wish it was included in this set.

1486215,3,B00005JM3C,"Well, admittedly, I purchased this several years ago but the physical quality is dismal.  Not the show, the discs.  Let me get this out of the way first.  Had it been manufactured properly and not on flimsy double-sided discs, I think it would have lasted a lot longer than it has. 5 years is not the average shelf-life of a DVD!  I have much older discs in my collection which are as clean as when I first purchased them.  Okay, 3 more discs would have done it.  Only 3 more per set.  My collection is suffering from DISC ROT!  I am so disappointed that I will have to purchase this thing again only after 5 years of ownership.  Not right.  Some episodes do not even play.  I take good care of my collection, keep then clean, dust-free, etc.  So, beware of a short shelf-life and be prepared to re-purchase this set.

Notwithstanding the pluses.  I love BSG (the Classic -- REAL BSG.  Sorry, kiddies, the bs SyFy rendered is NOT true battlestar.  The Man builds Machine, Machine gets smart, Machine rebells against Man is a tired scenario and Glen Larson had an awesome idea of making it mysterious by using another race's creation run amuk but SyFy blew it, BIG time.  Not really sure what the draw is, even in its' own right)  The episodes are intact, the extras are fantastic but the audio sucks.  Mono?  ??  Anyway, if you're a true Classic BSG fan, this is recommended.  It's great to watch these episodes, even tho they're not actually re-mastered, clearer than with the Rabbit Ears so many Yahren ;) ago.  Commentary was captivating and interesting.  Loved the deleted scenes, but I bet there were a lot more... still it was engrossing.

Episodes of Note: (SPOILER ALERT!)
Saga of a Star World: Should have been one complete episode, not 3 parts. Still gets an A.

Lost Planet of the Gods:  I found it outrageous  and really quite rediculous that they had to follow Egyptian Customs and use a male stand-in for Serina.  They come over here and do as they please.  Anyway, I give it an A.

The Lost Warrior:  ""Puppis""  My god, couldn't they come up with a BETTER name???  Character was about as annoying as the name. What saved it from a complete failure, the standoff between Red Eye & Apollo, when Red Eye says ""Uh oh!""  That was hilarious! D.

The Long Patrol:  Pretty funny, Starbuck gets the ride of his life. B.

Gun on Ice Planet Zero:  Could have been easily one episode, not two.  A little drawn out in spots. It would have received a B, but because it was a bit long, C.

The Magnificent Warriors: Entertaining.  I found it curious that two trained and seasoned warriors could be out-foxed by ordinary farmers.  B.

The Young Lords: A bit too silly if they were trying to be serious.  Unfortunately, the fact that a band of kids can keep a platoon of Cylons busy like that without being injured is more that just a little too far fetched.  Hard to believe that was the ONLY homestead left on that planet. D.

The Living Legend:  Sheba. Ugh.  Cute and all but she whined a lot, even more than Starbuck.  This was ALMOST the end for me, she was just a bit too sensitive for a warrior.  Her character could have been a bit stronger and not so annoying. I'm all for women in the military, but she needs to toughen up!  I was disappointed Cain and the Pegasus disappeared again.  Imagine the possibilities... Would've been an A if not for Sheba. B.

Fire in Space:  Had so much potential but just didn't quite make it. C - for effort.

War of the Gods: While I realize Sheba was hypnotized, she was still way too whiny and annoying. If not for her, it would have scored an A. B.

The Man With Nine Lives: Fred Astiare.  Need I say more? However, would've been an A without Sheba.  Too involved and girly...sickningly so! B-.

Murder on the Rising Star:  Meh. Having NOTHING to do with Sheba, this time, LOL! C.

Greetings from Earth:  Oh, MAN, the POTENTIAL with this one was awesome.  Again, missing the mark. I'm not sure why they always made the kids so annoying and out of control!  Hector & Vector were actually humorous but destroying Apollo's viper?  That was beyond stupid.  And the planet was supposed to be deserted.  Michael and company was supposed to be the ONLY inhabitants. Contradition of facts.  It surprised me that the Galactica did not have the technology to adapt the ship to their atmosphere. Could have been a B.

Baltar's Escape:  Not bad, actually.  I thought it was interesting they used the Borelian Nomen again and with so much focus. However, while politicians are idiots, it just doesn't seem to me they would be so blindly welcoming of people like that.  However, this whole thing would have been averted had they simply executed Baltar in War of the Gods.  It just shows how politicians can be bleeding hearts in any universe! LOL! B.

Experiment in Terra:  I think fans are torn over this one.  However, I actually liked it.  Sheba wasn't in it! A.

Take the Celestra:  Somebody was on vacation, no doubt.  How did this one pass QC? Bad acting and typical ""Starbuck and Apollo save the day."" I hate giving an F, so I'll give a D-.

The Hand of God: Well, they HAD to cast Sheba in this one and even though it was ""Starbuck and Apollo save the day... again,"" Why couldn't Boomer and Jolly have boarded the BaseShip?  Oh, wait, last time they went on a mission (Lost Planet of the Gods), they brought back more than recon data!  Anyway, this one was good.  Even the Star Dome scenes, where they used Apollo (coincidence?) mission footage. B. (sorry, Sheba ruined it...again!)

The booklet was great, too, but I think the Cylon head on the package was a bit much.  That came off almost instantly because it was difficult to store with it attached.  Artwork is very good.  So, all in all, it's worth the $90 it is now.  I must've been out of my mind when I bought it for $200, years ago, though.

EDIT: 6/20/2014
Dropped rating to 3 stars because disc quality is such that after only 3 plays, it now skips, freezes, does not access scenes from menu the way it should.  I handle ALL my DVD's like pure gold, only handling by the edges, dusting them before each play.  This, I believe is due to the inferior dual-sided disks.  I understand WHY this is done, but it renders an inferior product for the customer. I should not have to replace this every 3 plays!  Really frustrating and I am NOT going to invest another $35-40 for this only to have it happen again.  PERHAPS I will if it is released on Blu-Ray.  Just be aware that after a limited number of plays, your disk will begin to malfunction.",1323820800,,6537,4.463104325699746
1486216,5,B00005JM3C,"This is the classic 70's sci fi show. It was cancelled NOT because of ratings but because of the very high cost to produce it. This is long before cgi effects. ( computer generated images) and it was extremely expensive to make. The cylons are machines that continue on the war of their reptilian masters who are now extinct. This is different from the newer galactica , which is a great show also.  The shows are very different but in some ways the same. Both are classics in my opinion.  This set is a good one , with all the series episodes available. However they didn't clean up these episodes.  They should have but such is the luck we fans get, dirt and scratches in a age where computers can fix the problem.  The set is worth owning and alot of fun. It was tv's answer to Star wars and it was alot campier than that movie series for sure. But it's a good romp and it was much loved by viewers , in fact one poor lad jumped off the golden gate bridge after hearing it was cancelled.  the rest of us moved on and were glad to enjoy the newer galactica which is  a dark and serious show.  Galactica 1980"" is also worth owning , even though it's a shadow of this one.  The extras are not great on this set either.

But really, lets not fool ourselves that this was a terrific show in every aspect, it was fraught with all the seventies cliche haircuts, some real cheesy plots, too bad some of the plots weren't better, but that was 70's cheesy tv for ya.
Its too bad the show is so expensive brand new, very surprising, I had to wait to get it used, otherwise, ehh, unsure if I would have paid over fourty bucks, actually I found a used set for under thirty missing the cylon head packaging, but I was near the point I might have sprung for near full price, but hey, buying used is like saving the planet or something, like recycling.

1486218,3,B00005JM3C,"My mother is a Trekkie, therefore I was born in that world. When my mother discovered they were 'redoing' Battlestar Galactica, she had reservations because of how ridiculous she found the original series to be.

We watched it (the remake) and loved it. Later, I read quite a bit about the difficulties the original series had in keeping to the scripts they intended, and how the network did not believe in the vision of the show's creator, Glen A. Larson.
After reading this, I insisted to myself that I would see this show, in its original intention, to see what it was like, and how it differed from the remake that I loved.

When I discovered we could not find the show to rent, only 'Galactica, 1980,' I knew that meant I would have to purchase the original show to watch it once. I found it in town for about $50.00 and bought it, though I felt I may regret it later on.

Having now watched the lengthy pilot and the three succeeding episodes, I can say that so far I completely understand why this show was cancelled.

For one thing, it includes WAY too many two-parters, which is not something a late-'70's audience appreciated. Secondly, it seems to deviate more from its point than any show I have ever watched.

It is supposed to be about the genocide of the human race, and the remaining survivors are supposed to be space-bound, searching for a mythical planet called Earth. (It even shows and the narrator explains how all the humans from all the colonizes planets used the ships they had to join the rest of the fleet in search for a new home.) But, in the pilot episode, they find PEOPLE on a PLANET, that seem to be completely oblivious of the Cylon threat.

In later episodes, they discover MORE humans on OTHER planets. The way this is going, it feels more like the original series of 'Star Trek,' where the point of the series was to 'seek out new life, and new civilizations...' The genocide of the human race doesn't even really seem to matter, since the humans on the Galactica and the other ships could easily recolonize on any of the planets they have encountered thus far and defend that planet from the cylons.

It seems to me that the dislike the original series' fans had of the remake of the show was that it was too 'dark.' Well, how is a show that is SUPPOSED to be about the near annihilation of the human race supposed to be 'light-hearted,' including a character who seems bent on getting as many girls as possible, and who seems completely uninterested in the fact that his species has almost been completely destroyed?

The remake of this show stays to the point of the heart of the situation humans have found themselves. Realizing they are the only ones left, not encountering plants with humans on them, since humans have been nearly destroyed, and trying to discover that mythical planet known as Earth by the skin of their teeth.

What part of this show is supposed to be light-hearted? The original show, at its best, seems to digress from the seriousness of the situation at every turn. The only difference between the two is that the remake actually takes seriously the annihilation of the human race, the original felt like it was all happening on the screen, and not in real life.",1312070400,,3227,4.5595854922279795

In certain carousel-based DVD players such as the one I have (a 400-disc Blu-Ray/DVD changer), they do not remove easily enough to flip, so this makes it very inconvenient.

Admittedly going in, my expectations for 1978 television weren't very high and certainly some of those aspects were present.  There was a lot of use of ""stock shots"", at times the acting was cheesy and the costuming questionable.  However, as a devoted SciFi fan I viewed this series through a 1978 lens and did not let those more minor elements detract from what is overall a compelling story.  As I moved along the episodes, I found myself being drawn in to the plots and discovered the characters to be as endearing as when I first encountered this series so long ago.  Further, by 1978 standards, I found the graphics well done and in hindsight quite respectable considering that in '78 they certainly did not have the production and graphical aids of today. As I reached the end of the series, as in the Battlestar remake, I actually found myself wanting more and was disappointed that this series was terminated after only one season (Battlestar 1980, by the way, did not satisfy this thirst).

The video and audio quality are descent.  If I had one criticism, it would be that of the DVD format.  These discs are back to back discs that need to be turned over.  This is a personal hangup, but I find that such discs are more prone to damage and accordingly need more careful handling.  Cheaper for the manufacturer but a bit inconvenient for the consumer.

1486436,3,B00005JM3C,"First off, a note on my perspective: I watched this series purely for the purpose of comparing with the reimagined series. I didn't grow up with this series, and I don't have any nostalgia associated with it. I do, however, have an appreciation for classic science fiction and can be very forgiving when it comes to the dated aspects of the show.

The series begins with a brilliant premise, familiar to us all: Humans, fleeing the Cylons, seek Earth. Though many of the ideas are good, the execution (i.e., the quality of the episodes) varies wildly. Another reviewer here gives a pretty good episode-by-episode rundown, so I'll just say this: The show starts out interesting but shaky, becomes so bad it's nearly unwatchable, then recovers by the end.

Apollo and Starbuck are a great team. They have a great rapport, and this is key to holding the show together. Their absence from the Galactica 1980 series is undoubtedly one of the reasons why that reboot is considered an unmitigated disaster.

Sure, the Cylons look silly, a few special effects are reused over and over again, much of the acting is hammy, and the dialogue is frequently poorly written, but the same could be said about Star Trek, in all honesty. One could compare these series in many ways, and I'm not interested in doing that here, but I mention this only to point out that great series can have flaws. Given time, I think Battlestar Galactica could have continued to improve. Alas, it wasn't given that second season.

In the end, I found it fascinating to see how the reimagined series took all the best elements of the original epic series and created the show it deserved to be. The lamer aspects were left by the wayside (Boxey, the silly outfits, people in robot suits, and poorly made-up aliens), and the fascinating things were brought to the forefront. If nothing else, the original series had some great ideas - one of them even evolved into Quantum Leap a few years later.

The packaging of this set is really cool, with the Cylon head, making this a nice product to display rather than just stow on a shelf. Some discs are double-sided, which isn't something I like, but the DVDs are held firmly in their case. The booklet, too, has some nice images, there are deleted scenes for many of the episodes, and a well-done featurette with cast and crew interviews.

Overall, I think fans of the original series get a lot to enjoy here,. There are too many flaws in the writing and acting for me to give this four or five stars, but for those of us who are primarily fans of the reimagined series, there's a good argument for considering this mandatory viewing.",1266105600,8,2643,4.673118279569892

The three hour opening pilot was a ratings winner but successive episodes slipped to the point where the cost of the show (at the time the most expensive in tv history) sealed its doom.  Still, it is a fun show and if you don't expect a lot, it is entertaining.  Richard Hatch (off his stint as Michael Douglas' replacement on THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO ) as Captain Apollo, Dirk Benedict as his hot-shot buddy Starbuck (a tv Han Solo) and Lorne Greene as Commander Adama.  It is fun.  I found it amazing that it was reimagined.  When I first heard about those plans my thought was: ""What the f**k?""  But that series turned out well -- well the last episode is, well, preachy.  Another such ""reimagining"" is on the way with AMC's THE PRISONER.",1255996800,,881,4.45625
1486442,5,B00005JM3C,"It's what I alsways wanted, a 70's show I loved, I  hadn't seen for 20 years, all collected!",1250467200,,92,4.111111111111111
1486443,4,B00005JM3C,"For me, the golden age of television will always be the late 1970's and early 80's.  I think of shows like QUARK, BUCK ROGERS IN THE 25TH CENTURY, THE DUKES OF HAZARD, MAGNUM P.I., SIMON AND SIMON and of course, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.

Several of these shows, including BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, were created by Glen Larson who certainly left his mark on American TV history.  His shows seem rather sanitized by today's standards.  Where's the graphic violence?  Where's the blood?  Where's the sex? Personally, I find it refreshing not to have to deal with those things in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  When they did the remake in 2004 I feared that they might go in that direction, appealing to our most mean and base desires, and when I had the opportunity to watch some of the second season my fears were realized.  Whatever happened to just good, wholesome entertainment?

By contrast, one of the things I've always appreciated about the 1978 series is how traditional values are reaffirmed; values like, devotion to family, keeping a sense of humor,  faithfulness in friendship, respect for one's elders, courage under fire, good sportsmanship, making sacrifices for the greater good and (I know this makes some people wince) reverence for God.

The three-hour pilot episode presents the story line pretty well.  Suppose we didn't descend from monkeys and apes.  What if our ancestors actually came from outerspace and settled earth as a colony?  If that were true, it would be likely that there are human settlements scattered throughout the galaxy, more technologically advanced than ours.  Unfortunately though, these settlements have been all but destroyed by a hostile machine race that wants to completely wipe out humanity forever.  Battlestar Galactica is the story of the desperate journey of survivors to find the last bastion of humanity....earth.

It's a great idea, and there's alot that could have been done with it. Larson wanted the series to run for several years, but because of the massive expense of producing the show, the network decided to cancel it after the first season.  BIG MISTAKE!  The network also threw Larson a curve ball.  They wanted the survivors to find earth during the first season.  Larson complained, quite rightly, that if they did that it ruin the story line.  Apparently the compromise they came up with was that the survivors would find an earth-like planet (ie. Terra) and leave people guessing whether or not this was really earth.

Overall the production is quite good.  The special effects are amazing even by today's standards.  The acting is excellent especially from Lorne Greene, Fred Astaire, Lloyd Bridges and John Colicos.  Also the writing and creativity that went into the show are quite good, considering the pressure they were put under by the network.  Every episode is fresh and exciting.  In THE LONE WARRIOR Apollo lands on a planet with a cowboy settlement and he becomes a gun slinger.  How cool is that!

I would also point out that in the late 1970's our country was still deep into the cold war and reeling from our failure in Vietnam.  There were strong anti-war sentiments in this country at that time, and producing a series that questioned those sentiments took alot of guts.

The only sad part about the series is that it ended so abruptly, and when the network finally did decide to produce GALACTICA 1980 they couldn't get back their original cast.  I watched a few episodes of GALACTICA 1980 but it was a total flop.

In summary I would say that this series is a well-written timeless classic and I would recommend it to viewers of any age.  I just wish that it had a longer run.",1250035200,6,3650,4.908496732026144

If you put Star Trek on a budget and add lots of Christmas lights, this was what resulted.  It's light on characters,light on plot,however it's a lot of fun to watch this seventies relic. John Dykstra, who produced the effects for Star Wars,was resposible for Galactica.  A lot of the flight sequences are used repeatedly, but it's still good clean watching.  It didn't hold up well over time.  It's remake far surpasses this one. I do have to say that I have a spot in my heart for this version.",1249948800,,635,4.338983050847458

1486646,4,B00005JM3C,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was my favorite show during its 1978-79 Season, which I used to watch every Sunday night on ABC when BATTLESTAR GALACTICA made its debut on ABC in the Fall of 1978, which was a year before the science-fiction drama BUCK ROGERS:IN THE 25TH CENTURY made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1979.

The truth is BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was an awesome science-fiction drama in its 1st Season, but then it went downhill in its 2nd Season when the show changed its name to GALACTICA 1980 in its 1979-80 Season when BUCK ROGERS was in its 1st Season since BUCK ROGERS made its debut on NBC on Thursday September 20th, 1979 along with the fact that this Science-Fiction drama was starting to lose a lot of viewers through BUCK ROGERS since BUCK ROGERS was soaring in the ratings while BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was toppling in the ratings.

Another thing that led to BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's cancellation on ABC was Starbuck(Dirk Benedict, Apollo(Richard Hatch), Sheba(Anne Lockhart), etc. were all ousted from the show by GALACTICA's 2nd Season, but it just so happens that the same sort of thing ended up happening to BUCK ROGERS the following year when it started its 2nd Season on NBC in January of 1981 which led to BUCK ROGERS cancellation in the Summer of 1981 which was only a year later after ABC cancelled GALACTICA 1980 by the Summer of 1980, but it just so happens that the same sort of thing that led to BUCK ROGERS cancellation on NBC is the same sort of thing that led to BATTLESTAR GALACTICA on ABC since the ratings plummeted rapidly on BUCK ROGERS in its 2nd Season when Dr. Huer(Tim O'Connor) left the show and got replaced by Hawk Man(Thom Christopher)and a few other new characters on a new fleet.

Something intriguing that just occured to me was the red sensor light on the cylons on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is what inspired creator(Glen Larson)to have the red front moving scanner light installed in the middle on KITT on KNIGHT RIDER 4 years later when KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 since there's never been anything else like it on any other show besides BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and KNIGHT RIDER.

The one thing I don't understand is why didn't Universal just released the original BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with Lorne Green, Dirk Bendict, and Richard Hatch individually season by season like Universal did with their other shows like KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, MIAMI VICE, THE A-TEAM, AIRWOLF, etc. instead of just releasing BATTLESTAR GALACTICA in a complete series DVD box set.

Additionally, I enjoyed watching BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and BUCK ROGERS in reruns on the Sci-Fi Channel, and now BATTLESTAR GALACTICA will be coming to Me-TV this Summer.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Former rockstar(Rick Springfield)in the pilot episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL and before his days of being a famous teen idol in the early 1980's.

*Lance LeGault before his co-starring days as the disgruntled Col. Decker on THE A-TEAM and Magnum's high-strung superior officer(Col. Green)on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Edward Mulhare before his co-starring days as the Brittish(Devon Miles)on KNIGHT RIDER

*Randolph Mantooth after his co-starring days as L.A. County Fireman(Johnny Gage)on EMERGENCY

*Eric Server before his co-starring days as the voice of Dr. Theopolis on BUCK ROGERS:IN THE 25TH CENTURY

*Emmy winning actress Jane Seymour in the pilot episode

*Judith Chapman before her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS, DAYS OF OUR LIVES, and ONE LIFE TO LIVE

*Wilfred Hyde White in the pilot episode before his co-starring days as Dr. Goodfellow on BUCK ROGERS

1486653,5,B00005JM3C,"I got Battlestar Galactica as a gift for Christmas. Remembering the show as a child, I wasn't excited at all. After various people recommended this to me since I liked the original Star Trek and Star Wars movies, that I would find this as a great balance between. So I watched the first episode, and I was hooked. I couldn't believe the quality of the show and I guess as a child, I never gave this show a chance.

The dvd pack is awesome. It comes with six dvds and a pretty cool book that explains the episodes. The thing I didn't like about it is the fact that the dvds are double sided. My great question is why couldn't they just pack a lot of episodes together on one dvd rather than having just one or two episodes on each side of the disc? I guess the main ""problem"" is that over time, you get finger prints and other things on one side of the dvd, so it would require more care than a single sided dvd, in my opinion.

Overall, I think the show is pretty fantastic. I felt that it was indeed a mix between the original Star Trek and Star Wars. It binds the quality of both into a fairly cool collection of ""space opera.""",1231632000,6,1129,4.1506849315068495

1486761,4,B00005JM3C,"Battlestar Galactica was one of those late 70s / early 80s shows which quickly entered into popular culture. It has an excellent cast, including Starbuck (played by Dirk Benedict) who is a smoking, drinking, gambling, womanising pilot (with marked similarities to the Han Solo persona) and the more serious Captain Apollo (Richard Hatch) who is son of Commander Ardama (more like the serious foil / Luke Skywalker role). Commander Adama (Lorne Greene - from Bonanza) plays the main role as the serious commander of the Galactica ship.

Despite all the song and dance made of the similarity with Star Wars (Ep IV), this is a separate idea, and has more in common with a US military operation which operates like an aircraft carrier. The nice twist here is that they are carrying civilians too and are the last survivors of the cylon attack. It was a great idea for a series but after the first season it was clear they were starting to run out of ideas within the sitcom formula. The movie is a good entry point and will let you know whether you want to expore further - but be warned it is normally included in most versions of series 1 (1978) so you will end up buying it twice if you decide you like this.

1486970,4,B00005JM3C,"Talk about being ahead of its time.

This expensive and popular show started out extremely well, for a family-themed show that does ultimately end up corny in spots.

But it jumps the shark.  Recall the episode ""Fire in Space"" when the ship ends up in a disaster?  Well, not only is this the point the show jumps the shark in favor of meandering and soap-opera nonsense, it's also a template of which Star Trek TNG saw inspiration from in order to make ""Disaster"".  But I digress.  From here on, especially when we get to ""Baltar's Escape"", the Cylons too seem to have disappeared and all that's left is the soap opera between the characters.

Mind you, the finale - ""The Hand of God"" is rather good...

Other episodes to look out for include:

""The Living Legend"" - featuring Lloyd Bridges, this 2-parter is arguably the best episode made.

""Lost Planet of the Gods"" - Adama finds their long lost homeworld of Kobol, which has the details on how to get to Earth...  another good 2-parter...

""Gun on Ice Planet Zero"" - another two parter, this one is also a high point.

""War of the Gods"" is another high point; a good example of the show being ingenious, mystical, and corny at the same time.  It dares to be something big, and that is its greatest strength.

Indeed, BSG's multi-part stories tend to fare better than the one-offs.  Allowing for more character detail and a more epic scope, they do satisfy.

One thing about ""Saga of a Star World"" -- this was the BSG movie, revamped -- Baltar is no longer killed (he is given ""another chance"" to find the humans, of course).  I have to prefer the theatrical movie, as it seems more realistic - ironically.  :)

Into the pilot episode were added scenes that I had never seen before, ( and neither had Hatch if you listen to the commentary!)
Brought back lots of memories that I had forgotten about. Such as the episode with Aurora! I had totally forgotten about that one!

1487109,5,B00005JM3C,"This series is my all-time favorite, and this DVD set is the highlight of my collection!  People make fun of it for production values - so what, remember it was a 1970's TV show.  But the criticism I hear that bugs me the most is when people say it ""isn't edgy"", or that it doesn't reflect real life because it is too family-friendly with every episode having a moral if you look deep enough.  To me, this isn't a criticism of the original BSG as much as it is an indictment of today's TV fare, with its need to be ""edgy"" and ""real"".  Look at the new BSG series for example.  Starbuck is now a foul-mouthed, cigar-smoking female who punches out superior officers at the drop of a hat.  Military respect and discipline?  Forget it - they just don't exist.  Pilots routinely tell their CAG where to go.  And morals?  How about Starbuck sleeping with Apollo the night before marrying someone else.  No, give me the old BSG any day, with its morals and light-hearted fun - even with antiquated special effects.  If the new BSG had captured that spirit, it would have been 100 times better.

So this set is a breath of fresh air - fun, without losing site of values.  This set is also well-made, with high-quality transfers and some cool extras.  Heartily recommended!!",1181520000,16,1264,4.506607929515418
1487209,4,B00005JM3C,"Like the original Star Trek a decade before, the original Battlestar Galactica broke new ground that allowed for the newer, higher tech, special effects heavy series we know today.  At the time ""the most expensive show on television"", Galactica tells an epic story, a lonely quest, to find the lost 13th colony of Earth.  It's based on the premise that the great civilizations of Earth were founded by a parent civilization elsewhere in the universe that also founded other civilizations.  Drawing upon the imagery and language of ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt, the show never deviates from this premise:  all these cultures and the cultures of the 12 colonies are one and the same--at least in origin.  It's something I couldn't understand in 1978 when i was in the second grade, but can definitely see in this DVD collection.

The DVD set itself has a couple problems.  One is the ambiguous labeling of each of the disks.  some are double sided.  some are not.  it's never clear from any part of the packaging which are which.  I missed seeing a couple episodes because of this.  Since each disk has no more than 5 hours of programming, the format just doesn't make sense--on all other DVD sets I own (which is a lot) they are able to put five episodes on a disk without flipping.  In fact I have a Law and Order season that uses both sides but puts nearly twice the number of episodes.

Once this packaging error is fixed, i think this makes a great set.  Yes, the show is a little dated.  So is original star trek. Yet it would be unfair to judge a 1968 or 1978 program by 1998 standards.  The age of the supercomputer has radicially changed our concept and expectations in filmmaking.  it's almost refreshing to see a show where the ships are models instead of cgi animations and there are flesh and blood people in the background of the bridge scenes.

yes, it's a show from 1978, but what a ride!  they just don't make them like that anymore and never will!",1180828800,9,1966,4.562857142857143

1487215,4,B00005JM3C,"I really enjoyed the previous reviewer's episode guide.  I printed it and decided to see how my own humble opinions stacked up to his.  I especially laughed at his review of FIRE IN SPACE: ""A fire. In space.""

After a month of viewing it was fun to see where we saw eye to eye and where we differed.

SAGA OF THE STAR WORLD [A]: Pure classic.  The bridge sequence is beautifully cinematic.  This 3 hr pilot offers the very best of Galactica.

LOST PLANET OF THE GODS [A]: The magic continues without falter as the Galactica continues its escape from the Cylons in this 2 part story.

THE LOST WARRIOR [B-]: This Shane/ Wild West formula worked for me.  I enjoyed it and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Apollo showdown in the end with Red Eye was perfect.  The poor dubbing on the barking dog was laughable.  Still, it's a cool episode even if it riffs on many western classics.

THE LONG PATROL [C]: This Starbuck prison colony episode is a yawner.  I didn't care for it as much as I liked the previous Apollo solo plot.  I loved watching the actors in the Cylon uniforms in one sequence tentatively walk down the stairs in fear of falling.

THE GUN ON ICE PLANET ZERO [B]: The whole Hoth flavor of this episode worked for me.  I loved the story and enjoyed the ensemble cast.  It's a solid 2 part story.

THE MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS [D]: This episode plays it loose with the whole Magnificent Seven plot.  I love Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and anything that pays homage to it, but this particluar episode is poor.

THE YOUNG LORDS [C]: Starbuck crash lands on a planet and helps a group of children rescue their father from the Cylons.  Okay.

THE LIVING LEGEND [A]:  Lloyd Bridges guests as Commander Cain of the Pegasus.  Apparently Cassiopeia had a thing for him.  Damn he's good!  An excellent 2 part story.  Oh and the very hot Anne Lockhart as Sheba starts here, daughter of Cain.

FIRE IN SPACE [B]: A fire. In space, but man I can't be as harsh on this one.  I found it exciting.  It's like Towering Inferno on the Galactica.

It's riveting stuff especially given how atrocious GREETINGS FROM PLANET EARTH was.  I love the Apollo and Starbuck on wires bit.  My 8 year old noticed.

WAR OF THE GODS [A]:  Patrick MacNee stars as Count Iblis.  He's a long way from The Avengers.  This is a strong 2 part story.  The science fiction is very Star Trek here and the exchange between Adama and Iblis and others is taut with drama.  Great stuff.

THE MAN WITH NINE LIVES [B-]: Fred Astaire guests as the alleged father of Starbuck.  The Nomen arrive.  Good.

MURDER ON THE RISING STAR [C]: Starbuck is accused of murder following a heated exchange with a shipmate during a radical game of Triad.  Dig the undies guys!

GREETINGS FROM PLANET EARTH [F]:  You see Battlestar Galactica was truly ahead of its time with its own take on the Alliance [pre-FIREFLY].  You've got Ray Bolger guesting [formerly the Scarecrow] and Mantooth [formerly of Emergency 51 fame].  Hector and Vector perform a little dance number that Fred Astaire would not do for the show.  All of this culminates in a 2 part stinker.  It just isn't compelling sci-fi.

BALTAR'S ESCAPE [C+]: The Nomen and Baltar team-up to hijack.  Not good.

ESCAPE FROM TERRA [C-]: The Ship Of Lights [again]. Ed Mulhare [of Knight Rider fame] guests.  It takes a page out of the Cold War.  Again Not good.

TAKE THE CELESTRA [D]:  Great idea.  Fairly rediculous, silly execution. The Cylons have all but disappeared since FIRE IN SPACE.

THE HAND OF GOD [A]:  Premium Glactica returns along with the Cylons.  Where have you been guys?  Final episode here departs in a blaze of glory.  Great stuff but where has Boxey and Moffat gone.  They dissapeared with the Cylons but never came back.

REMEMBERING BATTLESTAR GALACTICA THE DOCUMENTARY [A]:  Terrific.  nice seeing the entire cast, reminisce about their fave episodes and see how they have all aged.  Lovely memories.  My wife tells me ""they are not your friends.""  I keep telling her but they are.  Apart, from overutilized explosions and dogfights, reused launch sequences, bad edits and some minor continuity problems [one episode Starbuck goes from long hair to short to long to short again - what!?], it was fantastic to watch these again.  Poking ocassional fun is part of the fun, but I was surprised how well this series looked being nearly 30 years old.  Sure, the mastering isn't there.  It would have been wonderful if they cleaned these prints up like they did with Star Wars, but still looked good and the 5.1 sounded great with the subwoofer.

A short, sweet, wonderful series thanks to great characters created with care and well-acted by a tremendous cast.  THUMBS WAY UP!  I can see why they brought it back for the SCI FI CHANNEL's NEW MASTERPIECE!",1173052800,11,4774,4.612903225806452
1487216,4,B00005JM3C,"For all lovers of the original Battlestar Galactica TV show I highly recommend this DVD collection.  It is attractively packaged and contains all of the original episodes along with deleted and alternate scenes. (It does not include the few episodes of BSG 1980, however, I never considered them as part of the original series anyway.)  It also has some interesting interviews with Glen A. Larson and many of the original cast members as well as various featurettes.  I did have trouble with one of the DVD's reading after watching it a few times but figured it was because of getting scratched and dirty, although, I noticed that others have had similar problems.  It's true some of the stories at times were a little ""cheesy"" as others have said but for a TV show filmed almost 30 years ago I think many of the special effects are still impressive and the stories fun and entertaining.",1171324800,7,887,4.740259740259741

1487340,4,B00005JM3C,"I was 11 years old when ""Battlestar Galactica"" hit the scene.  ""Star Wars"" had just hit the scene the previous year, and since this was in the days before multiplexes, it was still showing in theaters.  Think about it... a TV show, promising ""Star Wars""-like action EVERY WEEK?!?  FOR FREE?!?!?

Oh man, life was good.

The original BSG is late-70s TV at its best.  I won't go into the specifics of the show (that's what Wikipedia is for!), but I would like to say that the concept of Galactica was more ambitious than the culture paradigms of network TV allowed for.  So you end up with something that's a cross between ""Star Wars"" and ""The Love Boat"" in a stylistic sense.  Watching it now, almost 30 years later, it seems a bit goofy on the surface, but you can see what they were trying to do.

Anyone who is a fan of the mind-bogglingly awesome update of the show on the Sci-Fi Channel owes it to themselves to watch this show and see where it all began.  It will give you that much more of an appreciation for the new show.  You will see what elements they kept, what they modified, and what they dumped.  You'll see how they've taken certain plot points from the original that seemed insignificant and expanded upon them to create some of the best drama on TV today.  It's almost like saying ""Romeo and Juliet"" was based on ""West Side Story,"" not the other way around.

As far as the packaging goes, I picked this up new from Amazon for $10 cheaper than the NON-cylon head packaging.  It seemed like a no-brainer.  For the people who complain about the box being difficult to store next to their other DVDs... come on.  You don't by something as insanely cool as the Cylon head packaging (with red lenticular EYE!!) and STORE it!  This is for DISPLAY purposes, man!  This is to have on your shelves when your geeky friends come over so they can drool over it and say ""Duuuuuude!"" and you can say ""PWND!!""  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then go buy the regular box... those who understand?  You know what to do.",1168300800,5,2031,4.420485175202156
1487341,5,B00005JM3C,"The leaders of the twelve human colonies are making preparations to sign a peace treaty with the Cylons, their sworn enemy. On the eve of the treaty ceremony, with the aid of a villainous human traitor named Count Baltar a sneak attack is carried out on the unsuspecting Colonies by the Cylons.

Now under the protection of the last surviving colonial warship, a Battlestar named Galactica the remaining battered survivors have joined together to form a fleet of nearly 220 ships in search for a new home known as the 13th colony, which turns out to be Earth. Commander Adama of the Galactica continues to hold out hope that together they will find their new home. Along the way, the Colonials will encounter other species as well as the legendary warrior Commander Cain; whos only goal is to destroy Adama and the Galactica. If that wasn't enough the fleet will constantly be pursued throughout the galaxy by the Cylons.

Created from the Genius that was Glen A. Larson comes the sci-fi fantasy hit Battlestar Galactica that sadly only ran for one season 1978-79. The series starred veteran actor Lorne Greene as well as notable stars Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict. In my opinion the show was ahead of its time and it was abruptly cancelled.

What we have here is the one and only original ""Battlestar Galactica"", so definitely 5 stars all the way for this 70's sci-fi adventure classic. This deluxe box set including the awesome Cylon head packaging is way over priced for what you get. Don't get me wrong the DVD's themselves are incredible to say the least and I'm happy I own this set. The Cylon head packaging is really cool but definitely hard to store with my other DVD's and I wish Universal Studios would have kept the packaging simple.

The digitally re-mastered picture and the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound couldn't get any better in my opinion. Together the re-mastered picture and sound provide the ultimate viewing and listening experience for every ""Battlestar Galactica"" fan. I don't ever remember seeing or hearing this fantastic show looking or sounding as good when it originally aired on television. The 6 double sided discs, yes that's right double sided discs once again from Universal, come in a clear fold out digi-pak housed in the Cylon head packaging.

If you take away the deluxe Cylon head packaging you're basically left with a standard DVD box set and collectible episode guide booklet and nothing more than that. For the price this set cost, Universal Studios should have included the short lived ""Galactica 1980"" television series as a bonus for fans and maybe an autographed lobby card from one of the shows actors. Unless Universal Studios are planning to re-release the series again, this set is the only way to go and a must for any ""Battlestar Galactica"" fan despite the price.

The fight to save the entire human race has begun! The hope for peace between the Evil Cylons and the human space colonies has failed. Only one Battlestar spacecraft remains to aid the space travelers in their never ending journey for a new home called Earth. Standing in the way of the humans and their pursuit for a new home on earth are the Cylons and they'll stop at nothing to eliminate their enemy. The stage has been set for the ultimate showdown between the Cylons and the colonies, who will survive? Welcome to ""Battlestar Galactica"" the complete series. I hope this review is helpful.

1487342,4,B00005JM3C,"What can I say about a marvelous series like Battlestar Galactica?

In Brazil, this series was aired on sundays afternoons in the early eighties, I don't quite remember the correct year. In these same and nostalgic sundays we had Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Chips and Knightrider, but Galactica has a special meaning because of its epic proportions.

And this boxset only enlightens these proportions. It is very well decorated with photos and drawings from the first concepts for the series. The booklet has an excelent paper and the photos are stremely bright and sharp. The discs have high quality of audio and video which enrances the experience of watching the series. The menus are quite breath-taking expecially in the start when a cylon appears and say: By your comand !

Boy, I watched only one episode of the series each day so I could enjoy it as long as possible, and these were the better days of this year that is ending. It was a plunge into my childhood, in times I can never forget. The extras are ok, they could be longer in duration, but quite cover the main aspects of making the series and showing the actors in the present.

The only complaint I have about this collection is that it doesn't have the Galactica 1980's so it could be complete. If Buck Rogers In the 25th Century's boxset has the entire series, why Universal haven't done the same with Galactica?

Although Galactica 1980 officially is a new series, well there has been only 13 episodes made of it...and at least I would love to watch the last one with Dirk Bennedict lost in the planet with the cylon, the history of his son, if my memory doesn't deceive me.

That's why I give only 4 stars for this product, if it had Galactica 1980 included in the boxset it would reached 5 stars in my judgement. Anyway it rewards you each penny paid for it.",1164326400,6,1837,4.551515151515152
1487343,4,B00005JM3C,"I would like this dvd no matter what because I was a big fan of the original series as a kid.  However, the DVD is cheaply made.  The episodes were not cleaned up anywhere near as good as the old Star Trek episodes, which are as much as 14 years older if you go back to the original Stark Trek pilot.  There is also not many extras or commentary on the DVD.  The only commentary is on the orginal pilot movie.  The interviews with many of the former actors are quite brief.  I think it was mainly released to promote the blasphemous new series which I have tried to watch from time to time.  The new series compared to the original sucks really bad.  I think they should have just created a new show and made it a loose rip off of the original and called it something else.  If you are spoiled like me by the quality of 24 and Doctor Who DVDs you will be very disappointed.  However, I am still very happy to have the original series in my collection.

Yeah, it was extremely cheesy. And, at times, I just didn't feel that the humans were really running for their lives. Still, this was a great show.

Reading some of the reviews here, I feel like I'm in the minority in that I loved the old BSG and love the new one. Personally, I find the new BSG to be the best show on television.",1160352000,6,668,4.301587301587301

1. It is missing at least 9 episodes.

People take it for granted how many movies, tv shows and miniseries are available nowdays that are space oriented.

Back in the 70s there was only re-runs of startrek, Buck rogers and Battlestar Gallactica.

Yes this show came out in the late 70s.

Yes this show had lots of cheesy endings where all people fade to black while laughing.

But the space battle scenes were excellent for the time.

The bad guys looked like bad guys, sounded like bad guys and acted like your enemy.

They varied the plots so there was not just 1 enemy.

Fantastic show, box set could be better, but still way better than the terrible new BSG on scifi channel.",1154649600,4,793,4.406896551724138
1487347,4,B00005JM3C,"The original Battlestar Galactica is very nostalgic to those of us who grew up during the late 1970's. It is still special watching it over again, despite some of its cheesy parts. The great chemistry of the cast, well developed characters, and religious and mythological themes bring universal appeal to viewers of this series. It is full of hope, some episodes have great twists, and the acting is great and convincing.

The Highlights: (ones not focused on by other reviewers)

-The emotional struggle Lorne Green, Richard Hatch, and Dirk Benedict portray brings depth to a story of a people that see their civilization destroyed.

-by watching each episode one after the other in their proper order, you can enjoy the proper chronology of the voyages of the Galactica (as opposed to seeing bits of it during Galactica marathons on cable).

-family friendly characters and storylines (unlike the new, adulterated remake!)

-Hatch (Apollo), Benedict (Face--er, Starbuck!), and Jefferson's (Boomer) commentary of the pilot episode.

-Interviews with these three and other cast members (I can't believe that the guy who played Boxey is over 30. Yikes, I'm aging!)

-The last episode is NOT the stupid one where there's this five year old professor, where Lorne Green has a Santa beard, and where Apollo and Starbuck are replaced by two look-alikes that are rot-gut actors! Thank ""The Lords of Cobal"" that this series ends with Apollo and Starbuck making a daring infiltration of a cylon base ship!

The Negative Side:

-Anyone who grew up watching sci-fi shows with CGI graphics will be disappointed by the dated special effects of this series. REMEMBER: Galactica's special effects were as high tech back then as the original Star Wars. John Dykstra worked on both Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica.

-Speaking of special effects, how many times must the same Cylon fighter get blown up on the right corner of the TV screen? It get's annoying sometimes!!!! Knowing that each episode cost about a million bucks (lots of money back then) I don't blame the producers too much.

-When I see the ""space-aged"" dancers and hear their retro disco music during some Galactica episodes, I CRINGE! How did pop-culture survive the era of poofy hair?

-Those Triad (a game that's part volleyball, part indoor soccer) uniforms are HIDEOUS! If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the episode ""Murder on the Rising Star.""

This one-season show made a huge impact on millions because of the universal themes and fun characters. The stories are exciting and creative. After all these decades the original Battlestar Galactica still has got the magic.",1153872000,5,2643,5.076212471131639
1487348,5,B00005JM3C,"this shameless star wars clone was one of the most expenceive show on t.v. at the time,and even though i still enjoy it,it really was cheesey. after the first two shows the writeing began to get silly sometimes,and they reused the f/x far too much so that you could tell which ship would get blown up in a fight.

  with that out of the way,this is great campy fun and some of the shows are well done. not for all taste but if you grew up in the late 70's like me you will get a kick seeing this one again! check it out!!!!!!",1151452800,2,525,4.028846153846154

What happened when srbuck made a friend out of a cylon when he rebuilt him after he cracked on a planet and had a kid with a women the cylon found there.  What happened to the eposides when they went found earth.  It still featured commander adoma and boomer as the main characters from the  original cast.  It also had starbucks kid as the leader/ advisor of commander adoma?

1487438,5,B00005JM3C,"I LOVE this series. It definately takes me back to being a kid and having the entire family gather around the TV to watch it (something that rarely happens these days).

What people have to remember is this was one of the cutting edge for series of the time.  The computers that were used on the sets were state of the art (remember we are talking about late 70's early 80's when this was made).  Although probably highly politically incorrect by today's standards (with a lot of Starbuck's womanising and lines like: ""...you can't be a warrior because you are my wife"" from Apollo to Serina), most of the story lines had strong moral implications that taught right from wrong and good conquering evil, something lacking in a lot of series today.

I highly recommend this series for the true Battlestar Galactica fan. I'm still upset that it only lasted for one season...... it could have gone a long way if it was given more of a chance.

This series is good, clean family fun (unlike the smut driven ""re-invented"" current BG). Nothing beats the original!",1147651200,6,1056,4.655913978494624
1487439,3,B00005JM3C,"Although this DVD set isn't bad overall, it shouldn't be getting the praise it has gotten. The transfer of the pilot episode on disc 1 is terrible. Heavy grain, all sorts of specs and floaties, and the crispness and clarity of a professional transfer is sadly missing on ""Saga of a Star World"", the first episode. The complexions of the actors are usually washed out and faded. The first episode is a good 75% faded, with 25% of the other scenes passable. The bottom line is, this was obviously a poor transfer of an old VHS tape onto a DVD disc. Additionally, ""Saga of a Star World"" freezes just as the Carillon sequence is underway with Starbuck and Boomer watching the multi-mouthed singers. Additional scenes that were indeed filmed are still missing from the deleted scenes section, such as Starbuck and the othe pilots storming the bridge demanding to know why Adama pulled out of battle. The other episodes were transferred better, but the heavy grain is still evident.

On the positive side, a superb 5.1 dolby sound is on this set. The extras are good, though the ABC-TV previews of each episode before the actual broadcasts (not the pre-episode teasers) would have been welcome. For example, the pilot episode previews which aired in August 1978 a good month before the series premiered.

If you want a really good crisp transfer of the pilot episode, stick with the widescreen dvd release, though it really isn't widescreen with a good 28% of the picture clipped off at the top and bottom.",1147564800,10,1500,4.765384615384615
1487440,5,B00005JM3C,"After ""Star Wars"", I was always attracted to space operas.  Before ""Star Wars"", I was not that attracted to ""Star Trek"", until I saw ""Star Trek-The Motion Picture"" when my interest for Trek started flourishing -although I have always thought Spock is a great character.  But there was one space opera that established my passion for science-fiction, and that was ""Battlestar Galactica"", either in its movie version or in its TV show.

I love those Vipers and the Cylon ships are very cool, without forgetting how impressive the design of the Galactica herself is.  And even though the show now seems outdated, it still brings me great memories when I was in my pre-teens when I rushed to turn my TV on in my house in Caracas and watch it.  Lorne Greene has always been incredible, showing his commanding presence and demonstrating why he is impeccable as the eternal patriarch, either in ""Bonanza"" or in here.  I must say I was in love with Maren Jensen as Athena and Laurette Spang as Cassiopeia, and I still sigh for them when I watch them again on this DVD set.  Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict are fantastic as the heroes.  Gosh, there are so many things that I like about this TV show that it's difficult to remember them all.  Oh, I almost forgot: as a soundtrack collector, I still enjoy Stu Phillips' music and the theme he wrote together with series creator Glen A. Larson.

Thanks to Universal Home Video for releasing this DVD set with all the episodes of this great show.  The documentaries are fantastic, especially when you see the actors -as they are today -remembering their experience filming this classic sci-fi camp.  Too bad there weren't any more seasons, but I am quite satisfied with the updated remake, which tells each and every one of us that ""Battlestar Galactica"" is eternal.",1143676800,4,1803,4.725239616613418

1487546,3,B00005JM3C,"Let's see, it's been 20+ years since this classic ""Star Wars rip-off"" has been seen by the public, and this collection certainly tried its best to recapture the old series glory.

However, for the price, it falls short. First off, it's NOT the complete series! In fact, it's missing 5 critical episodes: Those aired in the 80s when the Galactica finally found Earth!

What the frack is up with that???

Second, for those who have an appalling memory, my recommendation is to wait to find this collection in a sale bin in about 6 months. While it's a good collection, it's just not worth the price to recapture those memories you have on how well you thought this show was.

If you're watching the new version on Sci-Fi, believe me when I tell you campy doesn't begin to describe the old 70s version. Fun as it was to sit through my ""Galact-a-thon"", I'm really disappointed I spent this much for the set, especially when I saw the missing episodes. I guess the genius minds at MCA/Universal didn't bother to think those other shows, although not directly part of the series before it was cancelled, were important to add to the box set, especially when 2 of the discs didn't even utilize the second side!!!!!

>:(

Regardless, stick with the new version and wait for a 75% off sale on this collection. In fact, you can catch re-runs on Sci-Fi of the older series to remind that memory of just how campy this show is.

Sure, it was good back then, but it's certainly laughable now, especially when most of the episodes seemed to be about helping those who migrated from the 12 colonies yarhens (geez, was the stupid time reference absolutely necessary in every fracken episode??) ago.

Also, MCA should have done a little editing magic on this series to shave off the amount of time one needed to spend watching the pilots REPEATEDLY keep pressing the fire button on the control stick! Believe it or not, it DID get irritating after the first TRILLION times we've seen it and that's just in the FIRST episode!

Sadly, the older show does have its flaws in the storyline (such as crew members disappearing from the show and the Cylons seemingly taking a vacation for about 5 episodes), but for good fun.... save your money.

Buy the new version. At least you won't regret it.

1487548,4,B00005JM3C,"I can't say what other reviewers have said enough: this set is fantastic.  After years of seeing these episodes edited on SciFi Channel, to have them on DVD uncut with digitally remastered audio and video is a wonderful treat, especially with all of the special features, including several hours of deleted scenes and outtakes.

My one major complaint is about the pilot episode. The nice thing is that it is FINALLY presented in uncut form.  For years, the only version was a truncated, edited movie version or you could watch in SciFi Channel with different scenes removed than the video version.  The pilot here is uncut, thankfully, but has not been restored in any way shape or form.  Some scenes are filled with grain, holes in the picture and the sharpness and clarity of scenes shot in red-light of the Galactica's bridge look atrocious and are terribly out of focus.  Seeing as several versions of the pilot existed, I was hoping that a full-restoration would be present and it is not

1487553,5,B00005JM3C,"I was 12 years old when Gallactica aired. I was in love with this series, and often got into alot of trouble with my parents over it. Mainly because we always had somewhere to go, or something to do when it came on.

  I am also an avid Trekkie too. I loved the original series of both of these great shows! However, let's face it. this is not the 1970's.....( and thank God it isn't). The problem is that most of us try to view these ""original"" shows in ""todays"" eye. You can not do that. Try to watch these shows the way YOU were then, a starry eyed nieve youth, still dreaming of what you wanted to be ""WHEN YOU GREW UP""! Not with your adult eye and and adult opinions of today.

  Too much has happened in this world since we were kids, and it has clouded the ""inner child"" that actually was entertained by these great shows. When you set down to watch one of these episodes of your youth, ( that is what it was too ), try to remember what else you used to do while watching it. Maybe grab a bowl of popcorn, or grab a big piilow, throw it on the floor in front of your t.v. and lay on your belly too close to the tube. Act like the kid you were then. YOu will see that it was fun then, and it can be fun now too!

  Dont' compare these newer versions to the originals. That is not what the writers, producers, actors, directors, or ther creators of these shows want. Keep the originals, origianl, and develope new opinions on the newer series'

  One of the things they did that I hate is they recorded on both sides of each disc, so if you get a bad one, a lot of episodes are potentially messed up.",1118448000,13,536,4.037735849056604
1487676,5,B00005JM3C,"Okay, yes this series is showing a little age and there were some obvious problems with some of the later episodes.  But you know what?  So what.  I grew up with Battlestar Galactica.  Couldn't wait for another episode when I was seven years-old.  Collected the models of the Viper and Cylon Raider, and even had a kid in my class who was an extra in ""Gun on Ice Planet Zero.""

People often forget that this series was done in 1978.  You can't compare that to today's television standards.  It also had one of the largest budgets for a television program.  Were certain special effects shots re-used?  Yes.  They used what they could.

John Dykstra still did a masterful job with the special effects, showing some incredible space-battles scenes of Vipers engaging Cylon fighters.  To me, there is still no single fighter in cinema or television history that is as cool in name and appearance as the Colonial Viper.

Some may also complain that the Vipers always destroyed the Cylon Raiders.  Again, think back to television of yesterday when you couldn't be killing people off so easily on television at a time when children watched the show.  Obviously, today's Battlestar Galactica doesn't have many of the ""issues"" that the original show had.

Still, you can't deny the true comradery of Apollo, Starbuck, and Boomer (something that I feel is missing in today's television); the sage-like wisdom of Commander Adama (greatly portrayed by Lorne Greene).  Dirk Benedict will forever be remembered as Starbuck, the wise-cracking, womanizing, hotshot pilot who always lightened the mood with a well-placed ""frack!"" or ""felgercarb!""  Even though Apollo could get on one's nerves at times with his ""boy scout"" approach to life, he is still a favorite character whom Richard Hatch made his own.

Favorite episodes for me are: War of the Gods, Hand of God, Lost Planet of the Gods, and Living Legend.

As I kid, I was heart-broken when this show went off the air.  But, I was ecstatic when I found out that they were finally releasing all the episodes, UNCUT, on DVD.  I'm currently serving as Peace Corps volunteer in Kazakhstan.  And one of the DVD series that I requested my family to send over was Battlestar Galactica.

Be sure to listen to the commentary of ""Saga of a Star World"" by Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, and Herbert Jefferson Jr.  It's great to hear them reminice and talk about their experiences on Battlestar Galactica.  Dirk is hilarious!",1116633600,5,2452,4.87409200968523

How fitting that it was from my mother who never let me stay up to watch it when it originally aired back in 1978 (I was only 8). I watched this series on weekend reruns in the early 80's along with Buck Rogers on UHF TV. I was also sick of missing when the Sci Fi Channel would show them. Now I own all 24 episodes on DVD! I was reminded of how cool the Cylons looked and sounded, especially the deeper sounding lead Gold Centurians. I loved Jonathan Harris as the voice of Lucifer the witty right hand Cylon (of the advanced IL Series) to Balter. Patrick MacNee was brilliant as the Cylon Imperious Leader and later as Count Iblis.

It was really cool seeing some of the deleted scenes for each episode. Some were alternate versions that they changed entirely and that was really neat to see. The bloopers were great. Not everyday you hear the guy who played Hector say,""I F***ed up!"" The booklet that acompanies this set is real nice. It has pictures and a synopsis on each episode with their original air dates and guest stars. The neatest thing I liked was the audio commentary on the pilot 3-parter with Richard Hatch (Apollo), Dirk Benedict (Starbuck), and Herbert Jefferson Jr. (Boomer). A good thing to do if you put on that commentary is turn the subtitles on so you have the show's dialogue to read while you listen to them talk.

The ""Cylon Head"" packaging can be a bit bulky for the DVD shelf but makes a great display piece. There is a set available without the ""Cylon Head"" packaging if you're not into that.
Much like the original Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica's run  was cut way too short... Both shows were on main stream network TV and didn't have the luxury of a Sci-Fi Channel to get that target audience like the new Battlestar series (which I like) and is enjoying a 2nd season.

1487849,4,B00005JM3C,"Coming hot on the heels of the theatrical success of Star Wars, ABC gave us what amounted to a space Western.  It may look dated now and the acting may not be the best in the world, but those of us who watched it never missed an episode.  Why?  Because it was enjoyable and if you were a sci-fi fan...well, there wasn't that much to choose from.

Now let's compare the original series with the 2005 version - it's a lot like comparing apples and oranges.  Lorne Greene made a perfect Adama....Edward James Olmos just doesn't cut it.  The Cylons in their original polyester/metallic outfits were much more believable than the current version which has them assuming human form and on and on.

If you're looking for an enjoyable romp through vintage 1970's sci-fi, you owe it to yourself to get the orginal Galactica.  Forget the remake.

And now, if only Universal would see fit to release the spin-off, Galactica 1980, the package would be perfect.",1105660800,8,948,4.662650602409639
1487850,1,B00005JM3C,I'll probably get beat up for this but Battlestar Galactica was a waste of television airtime and it's even a bigger waste of a perfectly good dvd disc.  The performances are lackluster probably because everyone was just there to make a buck.  The stories were silly and the dialogue is even sillier.  Even Mel Blank (the voice of the robot) couldn't help this sorry piece of trash.  Don't waste your money here.

1487851,5,B00005JM3C,"A great question about the deleted scenes was asked by lexta. I'm no Battlestar Galactica expert (I'm just a guy who enjoys the show and this set) but I do know that Lost Planet of the Gods was filmed to be a tele-film first but aired as a two part episode instead. The two part episode version is a few scenes shorter than the tele-movie version (I guess because credits had to be added to make it two episodes) and so the slightly shorter two part version was how the episode was first broadcast and seen by many fans. Many fans wanted the episodes just the way they were first shown and that's what the DVD set provides. Those scenes that were cut from Lost Planet when it became the two part episode first shown on network TV are now on the DVD as deleted scenes. The tele-movie version of Lost Planet was shown on TV later and it included those scenes so that's why some fans remember them. This set was designed to keep things as close to the way they were first presented and how many fans first saw them. So they didn't cut scenes for this set and this is NOT like Lucas' reworking of Star Wars. This version is the Lost Planet of the Gods that was first watched by fans plus the cut scenes and other scenes and bloopers and more. I think that's very cool becuase the set stays true to what was first aired, and loved by many fans, and gives us the extra scenes too. They tried to please all the fans and stay true to the episodes as first shown. I appreciate that.
Hope this helps clear things up. I have many DVDs and many are not this well done. This is amazing! I'm only a casual Battlestar fan but I admit it's damned impressive. I believe it's a five star DVD set.",1104969600,21,1678,4.214285714285714
1487852,4,B00005JM3C,"I'm a BG fan since it first broadcast and I'm enjoying the DVDs which I received as a gift.  But I'm wondering... I thought the ""Deleted scenes"" would be outtakes and things that were never seen on TV.  I don't normally watch such things on DVDs.  But I decided to watch the ""Deleted scenes"" from ""War of the Gods"" and there seemed to be quite a few ""deleted scenes"" that I remembered. That is to say, it seems to me that some of the ""Deleted scenes"" were in the original broadcast but were removed from the DVD version of the episode and relegated to the ""Deleted scenes"" section.

Case in point: In War of the Gods where the Council of 12 is ready to elect Iblis as president of the council and Adama asks for more time, I distinctly remember the conversation about not wanting to offend Iblis by taking too long and also when one of the council members responds, ""I for one find Adam's words true and reasonable.""  That was in the deleted scenes and I remember it from the original TV version but for some reason it wasn't in the DVD version of the episode.  And in the original TV version I remember them finding the lost pilots on the surface of the planet without fuel at the end of the program--and that fact is seen in the ""Deleted scenes""--but is nowhere to be seen if you just watch the ""War of The Gods"" episodes on the DVD.

Am I smoking something, or did they actually delete scenes from the original TV programs before they put them on the DVDs and relegate them to the ""deleted scenes?""  If so, I'm disappointed. I wanted to see the episodes just as I saw them in 1978 and if they deleted scenes from the original episodes when transferring them to DVD then this seems to be in line with George Lucas mangling the original versions of Star Wars after the fact and it should be mentioned.

I don't know which is worse: George Lucas adding stuff to the original Star Wars that wasn't there before or someone *removing* scenes from original Battlestar episodes...",1104883200,3,1975,4.418732782369146

1487854,5,B00005JM3C,"Sometimes television shows from our youth don't hold up well over time.  You watch them as adults and say ""how could I have watched this rubbish?"".  Not Battlestar Gallactica!  I enjoyed watching the show now maybe even more than I did as a wee lad back in the late 70's.

In my opinion, great casting, great cast chemistry, good stories (except ""Greeting from Earth - that episode was the epitome of BAD SCI-FI), tons of action and superb special effects that hold up today. In short, Battlestar Galactica is a fun show to watch.

POSITIVES:

1)Great transfer -The video clarity was excellent.  Got to give them credit for the 5.1 Dolby Digital mix also.  AWESOME.  Battlestar Galactica has never looked or sounded better.

2) You get to see legends such as Lorne Greene, Fred Astaire and Lloyd Bridges and Dirk Benedict (just kidding).

3) John Colicos as Baltar.  That guy is a riot. Great character actor (up there with Donald Pleasance and the under-appreciated Jack Colvin).

4) Extra Features and deleted scenes - really give you an idea of what goes into to making a television show. There were tons of deleted, untruncated and alternate takes.

5) The three amigos - Apollo, Starbuck and Boomer.  You can't beat that!  Their commentary on the pilot movie was COOL.

6) You see a lot of familar faces:  for example Jane Seymour, Rick ""Jessie's Girl"" Springfield, Ed Begley jr., Larry Manetti (Rick from Magnum P.I.)

Negatives:

1)The network BLEW IT when they cancelled the show.  It had at least ONE solid season left.  What a screw up.

2) That network REALLY blew it when they cheaped out on that lame comeback Galactica 80.  There was no way that show was going to make it without Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict.  Remember what happened when Bo & Luke were replaced by Coy and Vance on the Dukes of Hazzard?  Heads should have rolled.......

Overall, this is an AWESOME DVD set and I highly recommend it if you were a fan of the show or a fan of science fiction.",1104796800,6,1976,4.6521739130434785

1487954,5,B00005JM3C,"For those of you who seem to be completely confused, this is the complete ORIGINAL series of Battlestar Galactica.  You can find this info elsewhere, but the fact of the matter is this: Battlestar Galactica aired for one season, and then was abruptly cancelled, with no final episode (they thought they were coming back for season 2).  Then, after NBC was inundated with requests to bring the show back, they did a short season of a spin off called Galactica 80.  In this series, the network insisted on bringing the cost of the show way down, so the show was set on earth in present day, by having the Galactica finally reach us, in the year 1980.  Also, most of the original cast (save for Lorne Greene, and in only one episode, Dirk Benedict) were not included.  Boxey's character was now a grown up played by Barry Van Dyke.  But, the creativity of that show was so low, that most BG fans have washed their hands of it (much like the way Star Wars fans want to forget the SW Holiday Special).

As for what is included in this set: it is amazing.  The entire first and only season of Battlestar Galactica is included, with commentary on the original pilot episode by cast members Dirk Benedict, Richard Hatch and Herbert Jefferson, Jr., and it sounds like they had a blast recording it.  Unfortunately, we may never see them reprise those roles again, but at least we can now view the show in it's original glory.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, and the mini documentaries included are very complete.  Each episode even includes a blooper real and discarded and unfinished scenes.  So, for all of you old enough to remember it, this is a great collection, and well worth the money.  And for all of you too young to remember it, check this out.  This show was far ahead of it's time, even with all the behind the scenes bickering that eventually led to the shows downfall.",1104019200,12,1888,4.547337278106509

1487956,4,B00005JM3C,"When I was a kid I looked forward to each new episode of Battlestar Galactica.  I  was introduced to sci-fi in the theaters with Star Wars and BG filled the void until Empire was released.  At least that is what it seemed at the time - I could not get enough of this new/alternate world.  Yet, as I grew up I recalled the series fondly.

When the series was released on DVD I was excited to see how my childhood memories stacked up to my more ""enlightened"" tastes.  I was not disappointed.  Sure, there are the bad hairdos, the funky outfits (the gay roller-derby Triad garb?), sometimes cheesy acting, and contrived attempt to fit this into some western ideology.  On the other hand, one sees relatively early work of Jane Seymour, approachable characters, and lots of decent sci-fi special effects (yes, they do hold up after time).  With the deterioration of Star Wars (with the prequels), Battlestar once again fills my yearning for more of the sci-fi fantasy.

Do I have complaints?  Yes.  The price is high, especially when one considers that the six discs of material could have been put onto four - at least given the paradigm of using both sides.  I think that the series should have sold for half the price.

Another complaint is the lack of special features.  Perhaps the Ceylon-head package contained additional material, but the standard version is sparse.  Read my previous thoughts here - I want more.

On the other hand, I was willing to spend the money on the set and would do it again.  Sure, nostalgia played a big part, but placing the series against its contemporary competition shows that BG was a winner.  If you are contemplating whether to buy it, rent it first.  I think that you will be hooked before you hit disc 3.",1101686400,3,1743,4.615635179153094

1487959,5,B00005JM3C,"'There are those who believe

that life here began out there...'

Thus begins the tale of Battlestar Galactica, full of meaning and hope and mystical importance, spoken with the majestic voice of Patrick Macnee (best known from The Avengers).

Okay, enough theology for the moment.

Or, maybe not. The first episode, a movie-length introduction to the series, along with the first several episodes, definitely has theological undercurrents. It is the fight between good and evil. It is a wandering in the desert (of space) looking for the promised land. It is about hope and humanity, sensitivity and courage.

And, as a 12 year old (when I first saw it) I of course understood none of this. I merely loved the special effects in my own home (as opposed to the Star Wars which required payment at the movie theatre), the characters and the technology. I was amazed that every computer on the bridge set of the Galactica actually worked.

Today I'm amazed that the computer on which I'm typing this review has more power than all those computers combined!

The story is basic. Ambush in space because of a monumental betrayal by a sinister bad guy who is in turn double-crossed (Baltar), a quickly-organised escape from the evil mechanical Cylons (who both symbolise the terrors of technology as well as of autocratic rule--remember the Cold War?), a daring journey, and finally a hope. Unfortunately the series became a wandering in the desert with little hope for reaching the promised land, and in television-series timelines and lifelines, this just wasn't acceptable.

In video form, the entire series was not available.  It was frustrating that not all of them are available, as watching them in sequence left some gaps. However, there are enough dedicated fans who would purchase these (as is evidenced by the amount of BG 'junk' being auctioned at ebay and other such places) that the DVD generation has made all of the episodes available.  This includes the complete set of Battlestar Galactica (please note that Galactica: 1980 is a different, if related, series).

The series was fated only to last one year, due to high costs (a million an episode may be a standard 'ER' actor's salary, but back then it was big bucks even in Hollywood), a slumping viewership (which in retrospect was never as small as reported), and an overall lack of direction (not just that of the fleet). The journey was just taking too long for the era of instant gratification.

The first episode is a three-hour extravanganza.  The whole premise is set up here, and the rest of the episodes look back to this set-up.  The acting is fairly basic, occasionally rising above a level playing field (particularly Lorne Greene, the leading figure as Commander Adama), but the audience was supposed to be so 'wowed' by the special effects and sets that they wouldn't notice the slightly-above-average acting.  For the time, the effects were great; some scenes still hold up well.

The plot of this film goes from the destruction of the colonies, through the assembly of the 'rag-tag, fugitive fleet' to a final battle with some Cylon Death Stars, leaving an open-ended but hopeful conclusion between Apollo (Richard Hatch) and Starbuck (Dirk Benedict in pre- A-Team days).

Outstanding episodes of the series include Living Legends (guest starring Lloyd Bridges), the Man with Nine Lives (with Fred Astair), the War of the Gods (with Patrick Macnee out of the shadows of Imperious Leader) and the three-episode arc when  the Galactica encounters a planet named Terra, which is very earth-like in appearance.

There are documentary/interview segments worthwhile, including Dirk Benedict, Glen Larson (the creator/producer) and long-term fan and advocate/star, Richard Hatch.  There is also a trailer for the new Sci-Fi soon-to-be released series.",1100908800,6,3824,5.068580542264753

To those who are asking about the final episodes: Hand of God is the final episode and a very good one though it's sad that the show ended so early. It was one of the most exspensive shows of it's time. This series was followed by a low budget show that was aimed strictly at young children and called Galactica 80. That show took place on Earth to save costs and featured kids from the Galactica playing baseball and camping. It was not unlike the Star Wars holiday special or Ewok TV movies in that it was more of a 'Saturday Morning' version of Galactica and really lacked the charm, mystery, and most of the beloved characters of the original Galactica.

In my early twenties I saw it again, with an even different viewpoint: campy, corny, but with a lot of good qualities as well.

I'm 31 now, and even though I'd seen a few episodes on the Sci-Fi channel, watching these episodes in the boxed set was the first time since I was 5 that I really sat down and took in the series.  They don't make TV shows like this anymore -- sure it's corny at times, but the characters form a sort of family, and it's a show you can sit down and watch with your own kids and not worry about the content.  There's a warmth about it -- not to mention cool robot bad guys and neat spaceships (which is what appealed to me as a 5 year old).

I was excited when I learned that the Sci-Fi channel had created a new version of the show, but was ultimately disappointed by it -- even though they'd discarded all of the camp and corniness of the original, and made it more scientifically accurate, the new version also lacked the warmth, optimism, and family atmosphere (I sound like such an old man now) of the original.

Owned all of the figures, saw all of the episodes during sydication, etc. I think the episodes on these dvds along with the extra footage are THE BEST that anyone could ask for. So how can I say that and still give this set two stars you say? Here's the problems that are eating at me. First of all, I paid for what is called the ""complete set of BG episodes"". This is stated in MANY parts of the dvd set, the packaging, the ad on Amazon, etc. Well, this IS NOT THE COMPLETE SET! It is missing no less than 10 episodes. Yes, roughly 30% of the series! For those of you who just said ""no it's not"", here are the facts. There were 10 episodes made and released in 1980. Only one included Starbuck though. These episodes include when the Galactica found earth. I have the episode list, but it is too long to list here. Here's a link instead, [...]
You would think Glen Larson would have remembered filming these episodes before calling this the ""complete set of BG episodes"".  Unless he was smoking a little too much of the old peace pipe. The number two reason that I am disappointed overall in the set is the packaging. By the Lords of Cobol, it's bigger than a cylon baseship! If you don't own this set and you think the picture of the cylon packaging is neat, THINK AGAIN! It is a square box with a VERY LARGE cylon plastic face GLUED to the front of the box! It DOES NOT easily fit on any shelf or display case. I would have been much happier with a simple but awesome cylon 3D sticker on the front of the box. In short, this set could have been so awesome with just two VERY minor changes. One is, actually make it a COMPLETE set, not a partial one. And two is, get rid of the massively large packaging! If that had been done, I would be giving this set 5 stars! However I must say that I VERY much enjoyed watching the old episodes again.

 In 1978, my father had surprised me with my very own color television for my bedroom. Battlestar Galactica was the first show I saw that night. Eventually I became fond of the tv series. I had not realized it had been cancelled. I was still waiting for episodes the next Septmeber.
 Very nice television DVD set. Battlestar Galactica (1978-79) only lasted for one season. Originally meant to be only a seven-hour mini-series. Why the ABC network cancelled this science-fiction series is anyone's guess. It really was a hit with people. It debuted nearly 10 years after STAR TREK (1966-69, the original cast) had been cancelled and the very first STAR WARS (1977) film was released one year earlier. The STAR TREK reunion movie, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE was released in 1979. Battlestar Galactica was about to start a whole new science-fiction revolution.
 BG included a cast that we soon came to know: Lorne Green (Bonanza [1959-73], Earthquake [1974]), Richard Hatch (Best Friends [1975], Heated Vengeance [1985]), Dirk Benedict, Herbert Jefferson Jr, Maren Jensen, Tony Swartz, Noah Hathaway (The neverEnding Story [1984], Terry Carter, John Colicos, Laurette Spang, Paul Coufos (Days Of Our Lives in 1981-82), Sarah Rush and special Guest Star, Jane Seymour (Live and Let Die [1973]). Leann Hunley (Days of Our Lives in 1982-86, The Beverly Hillbillies [1993]) and Larry Manetti (Magnum PI) make appearances and The Daggit, ""Muffit"" too.
 The spaceships were so acceptable. The sound effects were smooth and easy on the ear. Very pleasent to hear. The cyclones with the moving red eye were like nothing we had seen before, almost hypnotizing. Battlestar Galactica was originally a tv series, but the pilot episodes were edited down into a theatrically released motion picture too. This DVD version includes scenes that were cut from the theatrical version and some scenes have been restored back into the episodes.
 The bubble-wrap as partition sends me. Lorne Greene still wearing his cowboy boots. Those light helments, and watching this tv series again makes me wish I still had my long hair back.
 Battlestar Galactica soon came back in a new tv series, Galactica 1980 starring Kent McCord (Adam-12) and Barry Van Dyke. Lorne Greene and Herb Jefferson Jr. returned. Richard Hatch and Glen A. Larson both tried for years to bring back BG in recent years. Richard Hatch made a test film Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming (1999), originally intending to bring back original cast members. Ultimatly, the SCI-FI Channel broadcast a new mini-series, Battlestar Galactica (2003) starring Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell. Instead of Apollo and Starbuck being two men, it was changed to man and woman. The Canadian white and grey sets looked nothing like we were used to seeing 25 years ago. And none of the original cast members had anything to do with this project. No cameo appearances. Dispite the disappointment of loyal fans, the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" will become a series in 2004.
  Original cast member of the original ""Battlestar Galactica"", Richard Hatch, had a special guest role in the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" tv series (Sci-Fi Channel,2005-08) as ""Tom Zarek"" a prisoner.",1087171200,4,3246,5.157794676806084
1488256,5,B00005JM3C,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA might not have been sci-fi at its best (due to financial constraints), but it deserves its place for the depth, originality, and scope it tries to bring to the small screen.  No other sci-fi show before it tried to do what it did.  Yes.  The acting was sometimes difficult to watch, but overall it offered something for its time other shows didn't.
It gave you hope that you could present a show that clearly tapped into the success of STAR WARS without being STAR WARS (by the way, will people realize that even when this came to court because of George Lucas suing over similarities between BSG & SW the court ruled in FAVOR of BSG?).  No small feat, when you realize how many shows after tried to just rip off STAR WARS without trying to craft a plot!
I've read all the whining about the 2nd season, and read how the show wasn't ever cancelled before the 2nd season went into production.  Obviously these reviews were written by children who don't research what they're talking about.  As a card-carrying geek from waaaaay back, I can say that the original show WAS cancelled by ABC because it was too expensive to produce (even with using stock footage, the show still was becoming a problem for ABC).  Because of the fan response, ABC decided to bring the show back...and when they did, the magic was gone.  The characters viewers wanted to see were gone.  What made BATTLESTAR GALACTICA memorable was lost.
Sure, there were two episodes I remember that were WORTH watching through once.  Yes.  The one with Starbuck & the Cylon on an alien planet (the title, BTW, was ""The Return of Starbuck"").  There was also one wherein a Cylon crashes on Earth, trying to reach a radio station to signal the Empire they had found Earth (this is the episode where HUMAN Cylons were first seen & it was hinted that there were other models of Cylons, finally).  However, as good as those two were (out of TEN episodes that were made, I might add), it doesn't warrant the horrible abomination that was GALACTICA 1980 as a part of this boxed set.  I'm glad someone realized that.
GALACTICA 1980 was rush-produced, and it showed.  The dialogue was even WORSE that what a few people have already complained about BATTLESTAR GALACTICA...and so was the acting.  Dick Van Dyke's son may be great in DIAGNOSIS MURDER, but he's no Dirk Benedict...and that was one of the reasons why they brought back Starbuck (for a one-shot deal) in the end.
The boxed set is well worth it.  But to those who don't know what they're buying in advance...quit your whining...and leave the reviews to those of us who do know.

With the high price, I was lucky to get a gift card during the holidays. Some episodes needed to be cleaned up better. (One thing I did notice during a deleted scene as Starbuck was running through the viper hanger during the bloodtrail from the ""BADGUYS"" he hit the deck in front of the viper that ""his dad"" was sitting in, anyway my dvd was silent- no sound from this out take.

1488260,5,B00005JM3C,"This is the ultimate collection for any Battlestar Galactica fan. It even has the final episode ""Hand of God"" where Apollo and Starbuck unknowingly receive a transmission from Earth. It is in the form of visual and garbled audio communications between the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon and Houston on Earth. They think it is a planted transmission by the Cylons to lure the Galactica into an ambush. The L.E.M. does look like a Cylon head when you think about it.
That was the first episode that I watched when I received this collection. I have not seen ""Hand of God"" in 25 years.
The box that the set came in was very easy to open: Just lift the top with the embossed Cylon head up and off and voila there are your DVDs. Anyone with any intelligence can easily figure it out.
Overall, it is very well done and presented. The DVDs fold out from the center, 3 on each folded side, 6 in all. The picture quality has been Digitally restored and the sound is in 5.1 Dolby Surround. The picture and sound quality is better than anything I saw 25 years ago when Battlestar Galactica was originally broadcast.
For how difficult it has been to get the entire series, the investment in buying this collection is a bargain.
So, when you receive your set, sit back and be truly amazed with this definitive Battlestar Galactica collection. Enjoy!!!",1077062400,3,1337,4.551867219917012
1488261,5,B00005JM3C,"I only remembered bits and pieces of the show from my childhood. Because I hardly remembered it, I didn't consider myself a die-hard fan of the series.
But I bought this, and to date it has been one of my favorite DVD boxed sets. I won't get into listing the episodes, actors, features, etc. (as others have done in great detail), but I will instead say this: ""Battlestar Galactica"" has the wit, soul and charm that is lacked by many shows of today--sci-fi or otherwise.
This boxed set has made me a die-hard fan of the show, and I now realize that this show has accomplished more in 24 episodes than many shows do in five seasons. After watching the last episode, I wished for more.
Keep in mind, this show did not get cancelled because it was bad--it was ABCs rating leader when it aired. Instead, the show was cancelled because the network thought it was too costly to produce.
Buy this boxed set--you will not be dissapointed.",1076889600,8,930,4.508875739644971
1488262,5,B00005JM3C,"As a child I was enamored with Battlestar Galactica. Having been bit by the Star Wars bug, I was sucked in to this, let's face it, Star Wars spin off.
I made sure that the BSG box set was at the top of my Christmas list for 2003. I have watched all of the episodes, and must admit how impressed I am with the quality of the transfer from film to digital. Although, I was a bit depressed with the format being full screen, and not widescreen, since I do have the pilot movie on DVD and it is widescreen. The audio seperation is impressive, since the original series was broadcasted in mono. That is one good thing about Universal Pictures, is that they always recorded the audio trax in dolby stereo, (the analog predecessor of Dolby Digital)and actually kept the individual audio trax, so that now, they could be converted to 5.1 digital sound. Although, it would have been better for them to transfer the trax to DTS sound. After all, this project was recorded well over 25 years ago.
The special features are incredible. The bloopers, and re-takes are fun to watch. I was especially touched by the featurette on the last disk, that interviews the cast 25 years after the show went off of the air.
I want to be clear about one important detail. There seems to be a bit of controversy between trekers and BSG fans concerning why BSG was cancelled and Star Trek went on to make three spin-off series and ten motion pictures. The answer is simple. Money!!! In 1977, Star Wars revolutionized cinematography. John Dykstra, who was the guru behind the special effects in Star Wars, was recruited by Glenn Larson, creator and executive producer for BSG to recreate the moive magic captured in Star Wars, and transform it to the TV screen. At a cost of one million dollars an episode, BSG is the most expensive televison series to date. Although the Neilson ratings were phenomenal, it wasn't enough to justify the million dollar price tag. This explains why stock footage was used to much, and the story lines did tend to become a little ridiculous, since the weekly story had to revolve around the limits of technology and the inability pump out brand new footage week after week. Rememeber, the technology Dykstra created to film Star Wars was the same equipment used in BSG. No CGI or Macintosh platfomrs to create lavish sets, and special effects with. Just two inch models. This process took time to perfect, since each explosion didn't want to explode the way the director envisioned it. BSG is classic story telling. Adamma, (Adam) leading a rag tag fugitive fleet( Noah, and the Ark) for a shinny planet known as earth.....(Moses leading the Hebrew's to the promised land) There is a lot of biblical character references in BSG, which is a good thing!!!!!!!
If you are not a BSG fan, then you can watch these episodes all you want and it's not going to register with you the way it registers with us.
If you are a BSG fan, then buy this box set, or hook up with someone who has it, and revisit your childhood. Trust me, it's worth it!!!!",1076889600,12,3039,4.588235294117647

1488402,5,B00005JM3C,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, after all these many years, has finally been presented to us in a beautifully packaged 6 disc DVD boxed set containing all 24 hours of the short-lived 1978-79 series, including the rarely seen three hour version of the pilot episode.  This set does not, however, include any entries from the horrendous follow-up series GALACTICA 1980, so you will have to look elsewhere for the highly sought after episode ""The Return Of Starbuck"".  I have included a list of each episode included in this set, as well as having rated each installment:
Saga Of A Star World (4   Stars)
Lost Planet Of The Gods, Parts 1 and 2 (4 Stars)
The Lost Warrior (2 Stars)
The Long Patrol (2  Stars)
The Gun On Ice Planet Zero, Parts 1 and 2 (4 Stars)
The Magnificent Warriors ( Star)
The Young Lords (1  Stars)
The Living Legend,  Parts 1 and 2 (5 Stars)
Fire In Space (1 Star)
War Of The Gods, Parts 1 and 2 (5 Stars)
The Man With Nine Lives (3   Stars)
Murder On The Rising Star (2  Stars)
Greetings From Earth, special two hour presentation (2   Stars)
Baltar's Escape (4 Stars)
Experiment In Terra ( Star)
Take The Celestra (2  Stars)
The Hand Of God (4  Stars)
Though starting off very strongly, the series quickly settled into an annoying habit of focusing all of its real effort on the two part episodes.  While this tactic provided the absolute highlights of the series (including such memorable episodes as ""The Living Legend"" and ""War of The Gods""), it left many of the hour long installments lacking in a major way.  Nearly all of the regular hour length episodes suffer from poorly written, uninteresting scripts  that are only kept alive by the character moments sprinkled throughout.  Hampering the efforts further was a noticeable drop in the production quality on these episodes.  The only two regular length episodes that really rise to the occasion are ""Baltar's Escape"" and the series finale ""The Hand Of God"".  These two episodes are prime examples of what could have been done in future seasons had the show continued.
In addition to series regulars Lorne Greene and John Colicos, the series guest starred many other well known actors and film legends.  Within, you will find the likes of Jane Seymour, Dan O'Herlihy, Roy Thinnes, Lloyd Bridges, Patrick MacNee, Fred Astaire, and Brock Peters.
I am very impressed with this boxed set as presented by Universal Studios.  They have been kind enough to provide each episode with deleted, alternate, and behind the scenes footage.  The only two episodes  that do not sport any extras what-so-ever are ""The Magnificent Warriors"" and ""Take The Celestra"", more than likely because none now exists.  There are several short documentaries to be found here as well, including an interview with series creator Glen A. Larson which I found to be very interesting and informative.  He discusses his inspirations for the show, as well as the many problems encountered while making it.  There is also an interview with the series' composer Stu Phillips.  Other goodies are spinkled throughout the set, including a retrospective look at the work that went into developing the Cylons for the film and subsequent series, as well as how they created the 'mechanical Daggit' Muffit!  There is also a very nifty photo gallery showcasing Ralph McQuarrie's beautiful pre-visualization art work for the first film that is not to be missed.  Lots of rare footage abounds in this DVD set, be sure to keep your eyes open for several differing shots of the never-shown-up-close face of the Cylon Imperious Leader!
The pilot movie contains a three person commentary track provided by stars Richard Hatch (Apollo), Dirk Benedict (Starbuck), and Herbert Jefferson Jr. (Boomer).  It is a very engaging discussion between the three as they joke and recall stories from the set.  They are still good friends in real life and that comes through on the commentary track very nicely.  This was one of the more entertaining commentaries that I have heard on DVD in some time, as well as providing lots of insight into what went on behind the scenes of the movie and series.  Also not to be missed at the conclusion of the set on Disc 6 is a 45 minute long featurette called ""Remembering Battlestar Galactica"".  It is a very interesting  look back at the show in the form of brand new interviews from surviving cast members.
The episodes are very nice looking on disc now that they have been digitally remastered, looking much better than they have ever appeared before.  Unfortunately, the time was not taken to try and clean up the picture of all the small scrapes and scratches.  Also, the super clarity of the DVD format has managed to upstage many of the special effects created by John Dykstra.  The poles that hold the models up are now rather visible in many of the spaceship shots.  Oh well, that is a small price to pay to finally own this series on DVD.  The sound has finally been remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, being available now for the first time ever in something other than mono.  It is wonderful to finally hear this series as it was meant to be heard!
Also included in this set is a 18 page booklet featuring episode synopsis and cast information, as well as lots of cool  pictures and graphics.  It is a rather nice addition, but doesn't really contain too much relevant information all the same.  The Cylon helmet shaped box that this set comes in is kind of neat, but takes up way too much room.  This set is now being released in a normal version like other DVD box sets, so it will fit right on the counter with the rest of your collections.
Overall, this series as a whole gets 4 stars and the DVD box set put together by Universal Studios gets 5 stars.",1075852800,11,5721,4.721774193548387
1488403,5,B00005JM3C,"First, let me say that I am an unabashed BG fan and have been since I was eight.  Most people wonder why while extolling the virtues of ""better"" sci-fi.  I counter with the fact that I like to look past the surface glitz and glammer at the substance of a show and BG had a wealth of that.  When I heard there was finally going to be a boxed set, I was elated.  And I was not disappointed.
This is one great set.  Universal leads out with the opening episode that has many restored scenes and a great (and at times hilarious) commentary by Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Herb Jefferson.  The following episodes are transferred perfectly to DVD and contain a wealth of deleted scenes, some of which are pretty amazing.  For instance, watching how Viper scenes were shot against timed film on a rear projection backdrop made me realize just how old school some the special effects were.  No blue screen acting here!  It also made me appreciate the high quality they tried to instill in each episode.
Throughout the collection are other nice mini-documentaries and short commentaries from the cast and crew.  There is also a really nice photo gallery with many great shots from the production of the show.  Man those models were big!
About the only drawback to the whole production is that the clarity of DVD shows some of the rough edges of this 25 year old series.  Matte outlines, wire rigging and such sometimes show up clearly on the screen.  George Lucas took the time to wipe that stuff out of the first three Star Wars movies.  Universal should have done the same.
Even with the rough edges, this is a fantastic set and one I highly recommend to anyone who is (or was) a fan of the series.",1075680000,,1695,4.496732026143791
1488404,5,B00005JM3C,"Well worth the price! If you are a fan of the show, get this set!

You can catch some reruns on the Scifi cnannel, but they don't play all episodes, they only seem to play the so called more popular ones. This box set has it, including the Feature film, which basically was a three part pilot. Otherwisw all episodes are included. There are quite a few episodes that are two part episodes, making for hours of entertinment. My only complaint would have to be that the episodes don't seem to tie into one another other than the basic search for Earth. This is just the way it is. Like I said at the begining, Money well spent.",1074816000,3,665,4.370967741935484
1488406,5,B00005JM3C,"The video is crisp and the extras are great for any fans of the series. I have to agree that the packaging is really impractical and that they could have spent a bit more time remastering the audio.  It's great for the time, but sounds cheap by current standards. However, as far as boxed sets go, this is a pretty good deal. I was pleasantly surprised when I first saw that the episodes had been released on DVD rather than just on VHS, but since the 25th anniversary SciFi series came out, it makes a bit more sense.
As for the reviewers that have complained that there are episodes missing; there aren't. It's the complete 22 episodes of the original series. What's missing is the spin-off series called ""Galactica 1980"". It really didn't have the same feel as the original series and it ended after only 10 episodes. Flying motorcycles, the obligatory viper in the park shot and the occassional knock-over of a payphone or ATM for cash is really all that I remember from it. Oh...and the kid genius (think Wesley Crusher, but add condescending to list of annoying traits).  It had some decent storylines, but it was really ""Battlestar Lite"".",1073088000,7,1145,4.663366336633663
1488407,3,B00005JM3C,"This was a bit disappointing. I loved the series when it was out originally and even saw the ""pilot"" when it came out theatrically. One of the great parts was the SOUND. How come the wonderful L.A. Philharmonic fabulous soundtrack sounds so ""tinny"" and bland? Plus, when it came thru the theaters in was one of the first ""Surround Sound"" mixes, EVER!?! I can't understand how that didn't translate to DVD. And who cares about the Cylon head box, anyway, I'd rather have ALL the episodes, not just the first season. What's up with that? I recall several dealing with their arrival at earth. Also, I recall one with Starbuck being standed with a Cylon (ala ""Enemy Mine"") that was quite good. The ones at earth weren't that great, but the were interesting. I gave 3 stars just because it was great in it's own time and still worth buying now.",1072828800,4,839,4.562913907284768

1488409,4,B00005JM3C,"This is the truest, most complete Battlestar Galactica presently available.  Yes, there is a ""movie"" version DVD that was re-released in October but it is obviously only for those who just want a taste of BSG, and not the whole meal.  The movie version (as I understand it) is NOT the true TV series pilot, but it does use some of it and a smattering of stuff from at least 2 other episodes.
I say that only to help with any confusion some fans may have over  whether they should purchase the movie or the series.  Or whether the ""movie"" was something entirely different than or unavailable in the series boxed set.
As to the boxed set: it is VERY complete and includes some truly remarkable extras (for virtually every episode).  It includes an amazing collector book, with amazing photos and episode listings.  Then there's the fun box itself.  I stress fun as that's really all it is.  It's very oversized, so adding it to your DVD shelves is almost impossible unless you dedicate a larger spot solely to it.  The Cylon mask also limits how well it sits on the shelf.  The eyes of the Cylon are a bit disappointing given current hologram abilities - they went with some imitation refractive plastic that doesn't even simlulate a single eye blip, nevermind one that appears to move.  I'm not looking for lit LEDs, but at least some kind of true illusion the Cylon had an eye, even if unmoving.
My other disappointment: the box back slip shows picture printed DVDs, this is FALSE.  As the DVDs must be double sided to accomodate the amount of stuff, they are not actually printed as depicted.  Shame on Universal for showing them to be.
I also am fairly impressed with the image quality, but it doesn't seem quite up to snuff with the restoration of the movie DVD or other older series/movies that are cleaned up for DVD.  It's certainly above original television release quality, but not truly DVD quality.  The sound however seemed quite crisp and clear.
As to the pricing of a set like this: seems a bit much compared to some full season (18-24 episodes) shows out there, but slightly less than other sci-fi series seasons.  In this case I justify it more easily by the unique (if somewhat awkward) box, loads of extras, great booklet, and that this is the first ever offering of this complete television series .
I rated this as 4 stars for my overall impressions, and nostalgia the series brings back to me.  I leaned towards a 3 given the price, and lasting troubles dealing with the box itself after the fun wore off - but everything else about this set stands above.",1072569600,3,2575,4.5873362445414845
1488410,5,B00005JM3C,"I saw Battlestar Galactica when it first aired in 1978.  I loved it then and I love it now.  When the series was released on DVD I was estatic!  If you love Battlestar Galactica, you will be too.  The episodes look great.  The real treat that this set offers is the oodles of extras.  Much of the cut scenes are material that I never knew existed.  In all, there is about 3 hours of deleated scenes.  I real treasure trove for Galactica fans.  But wait there is more!  The first episode has a fun and informative commentary track with Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Herbert Jefferson Jr!  There is also a documentary and  5 featurettes.  A great set that will thrill Battlestar Galactica fans for years to come.  The only down side is the packaging and an unwanted addition.  The giant Cylon head packaging may have seemed like a good idea on paper but it is really unweildy and hard to display on your DVD shelf.  A minor quibble.  The one thing that I wished they had replaced with something else is the promo for the horrible ""Galactica"" miniseries that aired recently on the sci fi channel.  It really has no place here.  I would rather they had more interviews with the original cast instead.  This minor annoyance aside, this is a must own for Battlestar Galactica/Science Fiction fans.

The Cylon Base Star was a cool ship and the Cylon Imperious Leader was Spooky. Patrick Macnee's voice as the Imperious Leader was great as well as Johnathan Harris(Dr. Zachary Smith from the Classic show Lost In Space)is super!! I fully recommend this DVD set. There are great episodes but my favorites are:
The Pilot episode
Gun On Ice PLanet Zero
The Living Legend
Lost Planet Of The Gods
Baltar's Escape.",1070928000,8,1249,5.067961165048544

1488523,1,B00005JM3C,"Possibly one of the worst television shows ever created, this series totally destroys any quality its amazing premise had with horrible plotting and dialogue, and acting that was even worse.  Rightfully cancelled mid-way into its second (even worse) season, ""Galactica"" somehow found its own little niche audience.
Like any other series created by Glen Larson, it has a great premise, but can't get anything else right.  The characters are poorly drawn, swaggering fools, and the Cylons are even worse.  They're slow-moving, dullards of machines.  It's a wonder even the foolish crew of the Galactica and its rag-tag fleet were able to defeat them so readily EVERY TIME they go into combat.
Avoid this set, unless you're REALLY into watching bad TV and movies.  This belongs on the same shelf with movies starring the likes of Steven Seagal and Freddie Prinze Jr.",1070755200,17,863,5.092198581560283
1488524,5,B00005JM3C,"The original 1978 sci-fi television series ""Battlestar Galactica"" was an epic adventure about a remnant of human refugees from a nation of twelve planets (known as the Colonies) fleeing an evil society of sentient machines known as Cylons.  Prior to the exodus, the humans had originally been trying to establish a peace treaty with the Cylon Empire to end a war that had been raging for 1000 yarns (years).  During which, the humans created a fleet of battlestars, which were analogous to huge naval aircraft carriers providing mobile bases in space for forces of smaller fighters (known as vipers) and their pilots.  Unfortunately, on the eve of what was to be the end of the war, the Cylons unleashed a massive surprise attack upon the undefended twelve planets and the unsuspecting battlestar fleet.  All but one of the members of the Council of Twelve (the human's ruling body), Commander Adama (Lorne Greene, 1915-1987) decided to take his battlestar, named Galactica, back to his home world in an attempt to defend it.  Adama's son, Capt. Apollo (Richard Hatch), was one of the viper pilots assigned to the Galactica, as was his friend Lt. Starbuck (Dirk Benedict).  As it was evident that the Cylons had practically extinguished all human life upon all twelve colonial planets and none of the other battlestars had survived the surprise attack, Adama made the unilateral decision for the remnants of the known human race to abandon the twelve colonial planets to find refuge with the mythical thirteenth tribe who had supposedly traveled to a mythical planet known as Earth.  Along the way, the human survivors discover that a traitor had been in their midst, Count Baltar (John Colicos); and they also come across (at one point) another battlestar (the battlestar Pegasus) that had been considered destroyed from an earlier battle.  From the Pegasus, the crew of Galactica acquires more personnel, including its commander's daughter, Sheba (Anne Lockhart).  Other memorable characters from the series included Lt. Boomer (Herb Jefferson Jr.), Col. Tigh (Terry Carter), Athena (Maren Jensen), her son Boxey (Noah Hathaway), Cassiopeia (Laurette Spang) and the Cylon named Lucifer (Felix Silla).
Unfortunately, the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" series was only aired for the single 1978-1979 television season because in spite of the fact that it had a Nielsen Rating of 18, ABC cancelled it due to enormous production costs.  Considerable effort and financing had been made to create the Cylons, the elaborate technological sets, and the high-quality special effects (for the time), as well as filming in various exotic locations.  One of the more interesting concepts introduced in the series was the idea of a battle between good and evil between beings existing on a higher plane of existence.  Sadly, this concept could not be further explored once the original series was cancelled.  ABC attempted to resurrect the series in 1980 in a watered-down, less-expensive version under the name ""Galactica 1980"", but it was a dismal failure as only one original cast member (Lorne Greene) had returned.  Only 10 lackluster episodes of ""Galactica 1980"" were filmed and, thankfully, are not included in this DVD boxed set of the original season.
The original episodes (24 hours total) include:
1. the 3-hour series opener ""Saga of a Star World"" (5+ stars, 9/17/78)
2. the two-part ""Lost Planet of the Gods"" (5 stars, 9/24/78 & 10/1/78)
3. ""The Lost Warrior"" (4 stars, 10/8/78)
4. ""The Long Patrol"" (4.5 stars, 10/15/78)
5. the two-part ""Gun on Ice Planet Zero"" (5+ stars, 10/22/78 & 10/29/78)
6. ""The Magnificent Warriors"" (4 stars, 11/12/78)
7. ""The Young Lords"" (4 stars, 11/19/78)
8. the two-part ""The Living Legend"" (5+ stars, 11/26/78 & 12/3/78)
9. ""Fire in Space"" (4.5 stars, 12/17/78)
10. the two-part ""War of the Gods"" (5 stars, 1/14/79 & 1/21/79)
11. ""The Man with Nine Lives"" (3.5 stars, 1/28/79)
12. ""Murder on the Rising Star"" (3 stars, 2/18/79)
13. the two-hour ""Greetings from Earth"" (4.5 stars, 2/25/79)
14. ""Baltar's Escape"" (4.5 stars, 3/11/79)
15. ""Experiment in Terra"" (5 stars, 3/18/79)
16. ""Take the Celestra"" (4 stars, 4/1/79)
17. ""The Hand of God"" (5 stars, 4/29/79)
Overall, I rate the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" series with 5 out of 5 stars.  It was a very good show that should not have been cancelled at the end of its first season.  Richard Hatch made several unsuccessful attempts to revive the original series, but the Sci-Fi Channel ultimately got the rights and has created a soon-to-be aired television mini-series that has been totally changed from the original story.",1070496000,23,4612,5.129333333333333

are great to watch. This show gives me new meaning

1488527,5,B00005JM3C,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA -- from its inception -- had the potential to become far much more than it ever amounted to on television.  That isn't to say that the show -- one of the highest rated premieres in the history of the medium -- doesn't have a record worth mention; it's just to say that had the series continued into a second or third season or had the series launched a series of theatrical films (an opinion I've long held), the phenomenon of GALACTICA would probably be as pronounced as STAR TREK or STAR WARS is today.
The series has been given top-shelf treatment here in this fully remastered DVD collection, and I can't imagine a missing piece to the puzzle.  The DVDs contain all of the episodes -- cut into seamless productions -- along with a handful of new production featurettes ('looking back,' 'special effects,' etc.) that are very good but could have packed more punch.  The commentary on the pilot episode/movie plays wonderfully, with the principal actors contributing terrific anecdotes and memories of their experiences in making the premiere.  Additional, EVERY EPISODE boasts deleted scenes, alternate takes, or outtakes (some hilarious ones!), and, arguably, some of these alone make this collection 'epic' in a single definition of the word.
While some episodes clearly are clunkers strung together on a thin plot under the strict constraints of network television, one fact remains clear: the creative forces behind the show worked very, very hard at maintaining the kind of continuity other science fiction shows strive for today.  They realized -- back then -- that serious fans were interested in stories that grew -- in situations that led to repercussions unanticiated -- in choices that were not always easy because they seemed 'right' so much as they were 'just.'

1488529,4,B00005JM3C,"Yes it is true.  I am one of those millions who saw that TV guide picture of Maren Jensen and just got drawn to the show.
And for the first 3 episodes of Battlestar Galactica, it was just pure joy....and it looked like Maren/Athena was going to be one of the main characters of this show. But...the producers or writers started going in the opposite direction. They decided to ignore the dynamics of the Adama family and added new characters that had nothing to do with the original premise that at least drew me and many who had hoped to see more of the Adama family show and it's success....Mainly Athena for me.
 Yes, Glen Larson who created and produced this show and maybe others...decided Athena and Maren...was not what he or they  wanted....(Big mistake IMO.)  As the season went on, it just got more frustrating...as Maren/Athena was getting less stoyline...along with the quality of the show...which went down hill after the first 3 episodes.
And the last 4 episodes only had Maren Jensen in the credits...GRRRRRRRR.
I personally struggled in deciding to buy this set....Why should I buy this DVD set if the original show gave me so much frustration??
Then I heared about the 3 hours of deleted scenes and outtakes....and I also heard that the pilot would be restored to it's original form,(Maren's two scenes that were cut when it was on cable TV, and the movie DVD.)
I finally decided to buy it...and Maren Jensen fans....the scenes are back....and more!!!!
She is as stunning as I remembered seeing her the first time...and there are many outtakes with her in it..:) Yippie!!
Also there is commentary from Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, and Herb Jefferson....they are great and hilarious.  They really put the movie in perspective and context. They in fact say everything most fans think of the show. And I loved the great things they said about Maren...that she was really sweet in person and just as stunningly beautiful. And they also were dismayed about the fact that Glen Larson's and and maybe others, decision not to use Maren anymore in the latter part of the series.
There are many good things about this DVD. Lorne Greene and all the actors that helped make this show. And the Maren Jensen parts of this DVD set makes up for the frustrating decisions that ultimately killed this series IMO.  Yes I am thankful that Glen put together this show....but I am truly dissapointed in his and who ever was responsible for taking Maren out of this series.
Yes get this DVD series if you love to see Maren Jensen. You will see it is worth the large sum of money.
And Maren if you are reading this, you still have a lot of fans waiting to see you come back to the acting field...we miss you.
I give this DVD set 4 stars instead of 5 because Maren is not in the latter part of the season......hee hee.",1069200000,6,2811,4.623246492985972

This is as close as the REAL fans of the series will get when Sci-Fi releases the version that is ridiculous in December. 3 hours of deleted scenes is what did it for me. Wow, does this really enhance the series! Scenes make more sense, things are more logical, its good clean fun! And the documentaries and commentary by Dirk Benedict, Richard Hatch and Herb Jefferson Jr. are great. Take it from me. I was the editor of a fanzine - THE KOBOL CHRONICLES - when I was a kid. THIS is what the fans want and is the best release of a dvd collection for a tv series I ever saw so far, including STAR TRREK, MASH, CHEERS...you name it. This one has class and style. You won't be disappointed...even by Apollo and Starbuck's hair! My advice? This is the BG to watch - not the one on Sci-Fi.",1069113600,8,813,4.251612903225807

New intreviews and commentary and goodness galore ... we even get our first good look at Imperious Leader!
This is a fun, classic show that I enjoy watching with the kids. Nothing beats those Cylons, and Starbuck and Apollo are just as cool and dashing as they were all those years ago. I only wish Sci Fi channel were doing a continuation of the original show than the vile, non-family friendly remake with dopey ""human"" Cylons ... bleech.",1068681600,6,689,4.564516129032258

1488646,5,B00005JM3C,"Having been a fan since its inception, I greatly anticipated the release of Battlestar Galactica on DVD.  You always have the marathons on Sci-Fi channel but the constant commercials after every few minutes gets monotonous!  I have now gone through every minute of the DVD set and must say that even after all these years I found them excellent!  The picture is cleaned up and looks great!  The most impressive thing for me was the noticeable improvement in the sound and music.  It is not only cleaned up and digitized but it is now in stereo instead of mono.  This fact alone makes a HUGE difference when putting it on a big screen with a decent sound system.  The stories are the stories, either you liked them or hated them.  I thought that perhaps I might find the stories a little hokey since I liked them so much as a teenager, but I was pleasantly surprised, they have seemed to survived the test of time.  I guess that is the sign of a classic.  Get your full set now since you never know if these DVD's will be available later, it is worth the price tag, especially when you break it down to being around $4.94 per episode (that's reasonable), and that doesn't even take into consideration all of the extra behind the scenes insights, commentaries, and deleted scenes.  This is a worthy investment and a true keepsake.  Thanks to all those who had a hand in its DVD release and shame on ABC who cut it after only one season many years ago, and it had the highest nielson ratings at the time, who knows how big Battlestar Galactica could have been.  The real beauty of this is that now my son is starting to get into the series just like I did when I was about his age.  Now that's the sign of a classic!",1068249600,52,1713,4.3627760252365935
1488647,5,B00005JM3C,"If Classic Trek is the epitome of a cult sci-fi show, then Battlestar Galactica is the very essence of one. The loyalty of the fan base is amazing, and Trekkies are probably jealous on some level or other about what little stolen thunder Galactica fans may have enjoyed in 1978 and since.
As for the series, to be honest, there are some problems with it. The blatant overuse of stock footage puts an Irwin Allen spin on the proceedings (realistically, how many times can a Viper get nicked in the top tailfin by Cylon laser fire, and escape destruction?!) The shamelessly 70's hairstyles, disco dancing, and kid-friendly atmosphere have all tended to date Galactica over time. But even so, despite everything, Galactica retains a certain charm unseen in any of those new Treks we've been inundated with.
The show was always a favorite of mine, but mostly because it was a show I watched as a kid, and have not seen except in bits and pieces over the years. Of course, I had to buy it when it came out on DVD.
The episodes have been transferred to disc with good quality, and the show is as crisp and colorful as possible. The Cylon packaging for the set is interesting, but ultimately fragile and too bulky for storage. While the attempt is appreciated, the special packaging works against those of us drowning in our DVD collections.
What really strikes me after screening the series in this set is just how BIG it was. The scale of the Galactica always seems to be nicely realized, especially on the bridge, which is just packed with extras moving about in the background. Touches like that help convey the epic scale of the story as well, and the sheer vastness of space in the Galactica Universe. On top of that, look at the names of those who guest starred; Lloyd Bridges, Fred Astaire, Ray Milland, Jane Seymour, Patrick Macnee, Lew Ayres, John Hoyt, Paul fix, Edward Mulhare, Rick Springfield, Jonathan Harris, Britt Ekland, Roy Thinnes, Ray Bolger, and more.
Besides that impressive roster, we have the regulars, Lorne Green and John Colicos. It goes without saying that Green was always amazing in any role he played, but I think if there is one actor who gets forgotten, it would have to be Colicos. Colicos was always incredible, here or in any other part. Richard Hatch also delivered in every instance, while Terry Carter, Herb Jefferson Jr., and Maren Jensen hit all the right notes when in front of the camera. Supporting actors David Greenan (Omega) and Sarah Rush (Rigel) also light up the screen in their admittedly limited roles. It pains me to admit it, but even Noah Hathaway (Boxey) gives a good accounting of himself in his part.
Certainly no new Trek can compare with the sheer size and scope of Battlestar Galactica, and the almost unsung achievements of this rare offering from 1978.
By comparison, the most disappointing aspect of screening the show after so long a time is the realization that Boxey, Muffit, and Athena all inexplicably vanish from the last fifth of the series. While I always disliked Boxy and his robot dog (I did like Athena), their sudden absence is very noticeable. Also, other than the two that cameo in ""Baltar's Escape"", there is the very palpable lack of Cylons in the last fifth of the series. Kind of hard to flee the Cylon tyranny when there are no Cylons to flee from!
The best feature in the set by far is the almost overwhelming amount of cut scenes and alternate takes. Not only do some of these snippets help fill in a few holes and illuminate certain plot points, but you get a good feeling for the production method used on the set to make the series. In fact, it's hard to choose the most important of the cut elements. Probably the best has little or nothing to do with the plots or whatnot, but a scene in which Adama explains to Boxey the problem that the Terrans face with differences in air pressure.
Fun to see this show again after so long, plus the cuts, and the featurettes. The behind the scenes documentary covers just about everything, too. All in all, the set is a real winner, and despite the dated hairstyles and whatnot, Battlestar Galactica reminds us that Trek is not all there is to sci-fi.",1068249600,493,4174,4.641891891891892
1488648,5,B00005JM3C,"I just finished viewing all of the content in the Battlestar Galactica DVD boxset. It took me nearly two weeks to view all of the episodes and extra features. There is an enormous amount of material to go through on this set.
The packaging is indeed unique, being a molded plastic Cylon helmet with a chrome coat on top of it. The ""Red Eye"" portion is a thin reflective coating similar to a lenticular sticker. The set is a little large with the helmet packaging, but that really doesn't bother me since it's interesting just to have sitting on a shelf. The set also comes with a nice collector's booklet with air dates and information about all of the episodes, photos, drawings, ship diagrams, etc. The booklet is about the size of a magazine, which is great since it wasn't some dinky little booklet.
As for the 6 DVD discs themselves, they are all Double-Sided. Universal shows Single-Sided on the advertising materials for the set, and even on the back of the boxset! That's a minor gripe, but somewhat deceiving to potential buyers. Many of the DVD's are Dual-layer on one side and Single-Layer on the opposite side to maximize the footage on a single DVD. The Menus on all 6 discs are the same, but still a nicely done motion layer sequence that runs at about 52 seconds. As for the interior package that holds all 6 DVD discs, it is a foldout package that has clear plastic disc holders with photos underneath. They are rather sturdy in their grasps on the discs, I had trouble freeing up one disc at first. On the opposite foldout side are layered photos from the series. All episodes and time lengths are also listed on the back of the inner package.
As for the episode transfers on the set, they are very clean and clear for a TV series which aired in the late 1970's. Actually they are almost too sharp and clear at times. You can sometimes see the ""matte-frames"" or ""wires"" in shots very clearly. It doesn't bother me while viewing, but it might with some viewers. At least the episodes were all untouched and not fooled around with. The sound is presented in a new Dolby Digital 5.1 mix. I didn't notice too much stereo seperation on my home theater system except in certain intense scenes. On nearly every episode there are various Deleted and Alternate scenes, and Bloopers. In total there are well over 3 hours of those additional scenes spanning the 6 discs.
There is a great 45 minute feature with all new interviews with the cast and creators. A video interview with series creator Glen Larson concerning the creation of the series is also included. To top it off, there are several mini-featurettes about the music score, Daggits, and Cylons.
I would gladly recommend this DVD set to any fan of the series. It is well worth the money and the wait to have the entire series to view at any time, and finally crystal clear in quality!",1068249600,254,2852,4.572265625
1488649,5,B00005JM3C,"I grew up watching Battlestar Galactica on TV and in later syndication. Definitely a landmark show in terms of the sheer scale of the production, large and extraordinarily well-cast acting ensemble and movie-quality special effects.
True, Battlestar did reuse its effects. True, some of the early episodes did borrow from popular movies of the time.
But who can argue with any show that drove home an original idea like a search for Earth, and did so with such a compelling background story, being driven by a seemingly unstoppable enemy?
I would say, pound for pound, Battlestar had some of the best science fiction stories ever produced for television in ""Living Legend"", ""War of the Gods"" and ""Lost Planet of the Gods"".
Any fan of the show will be thrilled with the nearly three hours of deleted scenes, organized per episode. In addition to full-length commentary of the pilot episode by Dirk Benedict, Richard Hatch and creator-producer Glen Larson, this DVD set has a number of first-seen extras. A 45 minute documentary on the making of the series with interviews from most of the cast remembering the event 25 years later. Documentaries on the Cylons, working with the Daggit, making the music for Battlestar Galactica and a particularly compelling piece by Glen Larson on the creation of Battlestar Galactica. The accompanying book on all the individual episodes and extras does not have enough written content, but great pictures.
Overall, still a lot of fun to watch, with good 16:9 widescreen presentation (although the picture has not been touched up from the TV masters), and excellent Dolby 5.1 sound.
Good for for the nine-year-old aspiring carrier pilot in you, and great for any fan of television science fiction! I can't believe this show didn't run for another five years.",1068163200,17,1792,5.037037037037037
1488650,5,B00005JM3C,"The content of this edition is better than one would expect from a 1970's series.  I have not recieved it yet, but according to the box, it only has commentaries on the original three episode pilot.  One wishes that there were more commentaries.  Another plus is that every episode is in stereo.  Even the original release of the pilot, (in the form of the theatrical feature film), was in mono, so that's a nice plus.
My only real beef, (and it's a big one) is the completely unnecessary large boxing of this edition, (with the glowing eye Cylon mask).  I feel that this collection would sell itself without this bulky extra, which would also bring down the rather high price tag for this series.  As others will, I'll wait to get it at a lower price.
As many others have stated, I, as well, grew up during the 70's and as a kid thoroughly enjoyed tuning into this show, so it definitely has a large camp value.  I also agree with other reviewers in that, don't look for deep, vast cosmic storylines.
Even Star Trek was commonly derivative, (that'll cheese off some trekkies), so, enjoy this for it's simple entertainment value.

1488769,4,B00005JM3C,"I was in Jr High when this show came out, and watched every episode faithfully.  I sat glued to the set, and couldn't wait for next week.  It is too bad that the show only lasted one season, as it would have been fun to have several seasons like Star Trek to explore new worlds and situations.  The show was ahead of its time, and while some of the effects and acting are typical 70's television, the mood created was a blast to experience as a kid.  A quick ""copy"" of Star Wars is evident in some ways, but the unique Egyptian overtones and compelling storyline makes this series worth watching on its own.
Here are the highlights.  Every episode is here, including some which are very rarely seen on reruns like ""Hand of God"" and ""Baltars Escape"".  The quality is excellent, as is the packaging and extras.  The book is well done, although too short.
However, there are some weak points to the set.  The ""deleted scenes"" are quite disappointing.  In fact, as I watched a few of them it was like seeing behind the stage at a play, interesting but it ruins the ""suspended disbelief"" required to enjoy the show.  Many of the deleted scenes are no more than outtakes and unpolished scene run throughs with voice stand ins and overdubs.  These are not the deleted scenes we have come to expect as polished portions of a film or show which have been cut.  Also, many of these so called deleted scenes were in the original showings, which mean that the episodes are not reproduced exactly as they were aired.
I am thrilled to have these on DVD, and enjoy them again. Sure, it's not the same as when I was 12, but then what is?",1067558400,14,1621,4.402684563758389
1488770,2,B00005JM3C,But doesn't hold up very well against contemporary competition.,1067558400,2,63,6.111111111111111
1488771,4,B00005JM3C,"I give this one 4 stars because, although it is nice to have the whole series on DVD, the picture (particularly the dark shades) tend to be grainy, and the package is susceptable to easy damage. The vac-formed Cylon helmet had three dents in it before I even got it home! If you do buy this, watch the pilot with commentary on- It's pretty entertaining! I laughed a few times! Anyway, if you liked the show, it's worth it. The extras are a nice addition. On the whole, just to have these on DVD makes it worth it. Unfortunately lasted only one season, but we all know that it cost something like 1 million per episode back then. Why would a studio spend that when you can air stupid sitcoms for very little money. A fun series...let's hope the new one isn't as bad as people are presuming it to be...",1067385600,5,800,4.304635761589404
1488772,4,B00005JM3C,"The first thing I noticed after I tore the plastic off my purchase was that the cool looking Cylon helmet box was only made of cardboard.  Tapping and feeling around its edges and corners made me realize that the box would probably degrade relatively quickly, particularly in relation to other boxed sets. The hi-tech look which showed cheap on close examination reminded instantly of the series.
Of course the only way you'll be able to store the box with other DVDs is to remove the box-in-a-box of DVDs and store the Cylon helmet separately.  The large TV-book was reminiscent of similar ones that they put out in the seventies.  Whether this was deliberate or not, I don't know, but it is a nice touch.
The TV series is lovingly brought back to life, in all its wonders and flaws.  The DVD brings out some of the border-line special effects that may have survived broadcast and VHS.  Still, this (at least for me) is all expected from a 25 year-old TV series, virtually the only one at the time (if not the only one)showing us space sequences.
It might just be my set, but the holding case seems to have a death grip on the DVDs, and since you can't place your fingers on the double-sided forum, it makes one concerned that the DVD might be broken or warped beyond usage.
Fan-boys(such as myself)will probably be the only ones wanting to buy this new.  I'd be willing to bet that this set will drop in cost inside of a year, whether or not the SCI-FI series is a success or not.  I do have a feeling that this will become a long term collector-item, but it will fade and be forgotten first.  In conclusion:  For those who loved it, buy it.  For those who haven't seen it, watch your friends, decide if you love it, and if you do, buy it!",1067126400,,1741,4.4125
1488773,4,B00005JM3C,"Before anyone chimes in with bad information, this is the complete series. They reach Earth in a second series - Galactica: 1980. The basic premise for Battlestar Galactica comes from Erich Von Daniken's theory that life on Earth originated elsewhere.
The Cylons destroy the 12 known colonies of humans and most of their military. A group of humans who survived the attack escapes on the remaining spaceships. The Battlestar Galactica is the only known military ship left. Commander Adama (Lorne Greene) of the Galactica tells everyone the legend of a 13th colony and decides to lead the humans to this 13th colony which is believed to have settled on a planet called Earth. The series focuses on the events of that journey.
All of the episodes are presented in their original format. For example, the pilot is 2 hours and 19 minutes long instead of broken up into 3 episodes. Unfortunately, the pilot episode isn't the same quality as the others in the set. Some bright points tend to blur a little such as a wide shot of the Galactica. There was some white smearing/blurring from the Galactica's landing bay in early scenes. Overall, the pilot is of very good quality, and it's better than I'm making it sound here. It's only a few scattered moments that created doubts about what the other episodes might be like.
The other episodes are near-perfect in quality - within the limits of what's possible. There are a few white specks in the picture at times, but the image is as sharp as what I remember from the Sci-Fi Channel using DirecTV.
One complaint some people may have is how often special effects footage gets reused. You will also see some clips from Silent Running at times. Another complaint may come from the vocabulary. Most people can probably figure out some of the words. For example, a daggit is a dog. The units of measurement may confuse some people, but you don't need to understand them perfectly to enjoy the series. The context of the dialogue helps clarify the meaning of the words.
I was surprised by the guest stars on this series. Fred Astaire!! ...who appears in ""The Man With Nine Lives."" Lloyd Bridges starred in ""The Living Legend."" John Hoyt (""Baltar's Escape"") was the doctor in the original pilot for Star Trek. Some of the others stood out for what they did after Galactica. Melody Anderson (""Experiment In Terra"") starred in the 1980 version of Flash Gordon.
Most of the extras are nice. The commentary on the pilot episode is fairly nice. Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, and Herbert Jefferson, Jr. provide some nice comments. It seems a commentary by a few actors is more interesting than a lone expert. It's not a dry, boring statement of facts.
The deleted scenes are mainly unused angles and some scattered lines that were cut out. There are only a few scenes that were not used at all plus a few bloopers. Most of the deleted scenes are raw footage - no music, no special effects, and no sound effects. You can hear the actors speaking the Cylons' lines in normal voices.
There are also featurettes on the Cylons and Muffit. There is a longer special Remembering Battlestar Galactica which has Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Herb Jefferson Jr., Laurette Spang, Terry Carter, Anne Lockhart, Patrick Macnee, Noah Hathaway, Glen A. Larson, and a few others discussing the series and memories. Not all of the memories are strictly about the series such as Noah going on a ""date"" with Laurette. Some of the deleted scenes appear in this special. There is also an extended trailer for Sci-Fi Channel's new Battlestar Galactica. There is a featurette about the new PS2, XBox game too.
There are two things about this set that bug me. I am not a fan of two-sided DVDs. Disc #4 and #5 are single-sided, but #6 goes back to being two-sided. I hate two-sided DVDs because it's easy to get fingerprints and smudges on the disc. I don't mind it as much if one side is letterboxed and the other is pan/scan where I'm more likely to watch only one side.
The insert that holds the DVDs is the same size as the ones you'll find in box sets for Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Simpsons and others. The insert is about 5.5 x 7 3/8 inches. The box for the series is big - 8.5 x 10 inches. The collector's book is the only thing in the box that explains the size. Universal could have reduced the size of the book and use a storage box that's the same size as those Paramount uses for their Star Trek series (except for the original). The DVD insert fits into a cut-out in a piece of foam rubber inside the box. This box will not fit on the same shelf as your other DVDs or tapes.
TRIVIA: Besides the guest stars I mentioned above...
John Colicos was the first Klingon commander.
John Dykstra also did special effect for Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope (original edition, not special edition) and Spider-Man (2002). Dykstra has also won awards for his work.",1067126400,2,4882,4.632064590542099
1488774,5,B00005JM3C,"I've loved BG since it's 3 hour pilot way back in 1978.  To at last have the series on DVD - and all in one great box - is fantastic.  However, there is one drawback one can't help but notice - the DVD transfers are at times TOO good.  During the outer space shots the 'junk mattes' around the ships stand out on the digital transfer so much that it is actually distracting.  Granted, the sound and picture quality are lightyears ahead of the old MCA videos, but one wishes someone at Universal could have taken the time and money to 'fix' the space shots a bit - just tweaking the contrast on the original film stock probably would have done it.  That said, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND this set...the deleted scenes alone are worth the price!  Long live Battlestar Galactica (and hopefully a quick death the the insipid 'remake')!",1067040000,3,828,4.486666666666666
1488910,5,B00005JM3C,"Well it's here, Battlestar Galactica, the complete series on DVD for the first time!
Once you open the silver box with the shelf space consuming Cylon head on the front, you get a DVD set which once again brings the epic adventures of the crew of the Galactica back to life.
In this series there is something for all the family, gorgeous gals and handsome hunks, wise and steadfast men and cute furry creatures that are man's (or a boy's) best friend!
The special effects still give the CGI blockbusters of today a run for their money, and the chrome-plated baddies, the Cylons, still endure as an icon of evil.
Battlestar Galactica's message - a tale of hope in desperate times, and its themes of family and friendship, selflessness and sacrifice are as relevant today as they were in 1978.
The set's picture quality and sound is top notch, the menus are easy to navigate and there is a wealth of deleted\alternate scenes to watch after each episode.
There are a number of short documentaries and one 45 minute one in which the original cast, guest stars and directors etc, remember the making of the series, and their enthusiasm for the show is infectious. There are also a number of outtakes, the ""wedgie"" one being particularly funny!
Universal have excelled themselves with this DVD set and are to be congratulated for its contents, presentation and packaging.
Buy it now!",1067040000,8,1377,4.7656903765690375
1488911,3,B00005JM3C,"OK. OK, I now have bought both the film and the series and so I now believe I have a right to sound off.  When I originally watched BSG, at the old age of 24, I was looking forward to a great show--the fanzines were hyping it and ABC was trying to sell it as the greatest epic ever made for TV.  (Which should have told me something was rotten in Denmark, but....).  The show was great--the music was good, the actors were good--and a big masculine Woo-Woo for Maren Jensen--the first two hours were magnificent, but when the fleet hit the casino, then the manure hit the fan.  It was all down hill from there.
  The problem lies with producer/creator Glen Larson, AKA ""Grand Larceny"" for his products that look lifted from good to better films--remember ""Alias Smith and Jones"" (which was a rip-off of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"").  While he kept claiming that he was a sci-fi reader much of BSG appeared to be a rip-off of older films from ""Shane"" to the much-mentioned ""The Guns of Navarone.""  These liftings killed the series and it didn't help that Larson then used Ray Bolger (a probable mis-spelling there) and Bobby Van as robots--give the audience a break, GL.
  So, why did I buy this set?  Once in a great while, a moment or two do appear of the greatness that could have been BSG.  I now have hope for the new mini-series to fulfill the original promise--unless there is another casino on a planet of living bugs and then we are all back to square one.
  Buy it for the effects, music and Maren Jensen, but--please!--don't call it good or great.",1066953600,3,1566,4.46830985915493
1488912,5,B00005JM3C,"Okay, so the oversized Cylon-head box won't fit neatly on a shelf with other ""regulation sized"" DVDs. This is to be expected for a DVD set of Battlestar Galactica: a show which forged a path all its own.
This DVD set includes the complete original series. No, this doesn't include ""Galactica 1980,"" as if anyone would want it to. Instead, it includes all 22 episodes of the original series, before ABC-TV pulled the plug in April 1979. Each of the six discs is two-sided, meaning essentially 12 discs for the 22 episodes. This leaves room for the episodes and a slew of extras.
Extras...? How about an audio commentary for the pilot episode, including Dirk Benedict (Starbuck) and Richard Hatch (Apollo)? How about tons upon tons of deleted scenes for 15 of the episodes...? Granted these deletions are very ""raw cut"" though that's what makes them so cool. Someone literally must've scrounged the cutting room floor for all of this lost footage. Featurettes include an interview with series creator Glen A. Larson, a look at the robot ""Daggit,"" a look at the upcoming video game (which stars Terminator 3's Kristanna Loken), and the new Sci-Fi Channel Mini-Series.
The best extra is a 45 minute reunion special, on the final disc (fitting enough). All the original cast and crew are present, with the exception of Jane Seymour, Lorne Greene and Maren Jensen. This is a nice addition. They obviously had a lot of fun starring in this show. That's only fair. I had a lot of fun watching them!",1066867200,9,1490,4.77906976744186

Thanks to Universal for releasing it and including the deleted scenes and commentaries, but why didn't they even make a small attempt at cleaning up the transfer? It's as bad as anything I've ever seen in a few spots, while in other places it's crystal clear and sharp. All in all, in my opinion the price is not out of line for the work that was done gathering and arranging the shows, the extras, subtitling, and everything else in making the set on par with the Star Trek DVD releases (and they're even more expensive). Finally, as an aside, is the whole Mormon similarity thing REALLY that big an issue for some people? Honestly, if you're watching a sci-fi series from the 70s trying to glean all the religious overtones, I think you've missed the point of the series ;-). I think I can say with certainty that Glen Larsen wasn't trying to be a missionary with BG, LDS was just a religion he was naturally familiar with that would be quite unfamiliar at the time to just about the entire country outside of Utah and would therefore sound alien and mystical.

There are featurettes, previews, and a big book with episode synopsis. My only complaint really is that the box is so huge. There's no way it can go on my DVD shelf along with everything else. also the case they used to hold the actual DVDs is difficult, and I am afraid of snapping the discs. The packaging is my problem, but the disks are great. 6 disks, double sided and packed with features on each side, you probably won't be wanting more, unless you're like me and want the last episode of Galactica 1980 to complete the set.",1066780800,5,701,4.571428571428571
1488917,3,B00005JM3C,"If you are reading this and are interested in purchasing the Battlestar Galactica series on DVD, then you already know about the series. But what about the DVD set?
I was disappointed.
First of all, the video quality was grainy in spots and there were a lot of defects. They don't appear to have done ANY cleanup. The special effects weren't cleaned up or improved any either. The audio seems to be mono which is not surprising considering when this was made. Another nit pick I have is that you have to flip DVD's over and there are no lables on the DVD's as a result. This is a small thing, but I like having one side of the DVD with a label on it. It looks better and easier to identify the DVD when it's not in it's case.
Overall, considering there was no clean up of the video, no improvement of special effects, no upgrade of the audio, and no labels on the DVD's themselves, I think this DVD set is way over priced.
If you haven't purchased it yet, wait until it goes on sale closer to $50 or $60.
Or better yet, maybe someday they will come out with a special edition where they have cleaned up all of the problems.",1066780800,50,1123,4.227906976744186

All the episodes are shown uncut and the quality is great.
There are tons (over 100 cut scenes/alternate scenes)from the episodes.
The commentary from Apollo, Starbuck, and Boomer on the first episode is fun to listen to, although I would have liked commentary on MORE EPISODES, especially LIVING LEGEND.
The bonus documentaries are pretty good, but I would have enjoyed more commentary from Glen Larson.
Overall, this DVD set is a must for fans. I would rate the DVD an A, and the bonus material a B.",1066780800,5,563,4.64

Anyway, the set overall is very nice.  (I'm just going to need to buy a photo rack to display this box.) The sound is wonderful - very clear and in stereo.  The picture is sharp.  All of the outakes are fun to watch.  We've just started going through them all, but have been satisfied with the set so far.  Only disappointment is it appears they did not include the trailers for each upcoming episode.

1489000,5,B00005JM3C,"Galactica was a phenomenon of its own while I was growing up. It wasn't glorious like Star Wars, and it didn't pursue sci-fi mysteries like Star Trek. So why did people love Galactica and continue to do so today?
It had a great overall plot. 12 tribes of humans, betrayed and hunted by a robot race created by Cylons (who were also destroyed by their own creation). Refugees from every colony led by a single warship to search for a planet known only in their legends... our planet Earth.
Episodes had very solid stories. Galactica was not the best eye candy at the time, so it made up for it by having some of the best stories in a TV sci-fi series. Most of the space combat scenes were the same cuts used in the original feature film. The episodes were distinct, yet it did not take away from the overall plot.
They had great characters with distinct personalities. They are memorable, and each play their role very well. Commander Adama, Apollo, Starbuck, Boomer, Athena, Cassiopia, Sheba, the list goes on... Mix that in with Galactica lingos like centons and microns, daggit, their own card game called pyramid, and of course who can forget frac and fildergarb...
The series will grow on you over time. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, there are plenty of good stories to keep you interested. The conclusion to the series which ended up in the Galactica 1980 feature, unfortunately, is not a part of this box set.",1066608000,6,1428,4.58203125
1489001,5,B00005JM3C,"This is a wonderful box set, nearly perfect in content. Almost every story has deleted scenes. In fact, there are over 3 hours of deleted scenes on this box set. Yes, 3 HOURS!!!! The deleted scenes include bloopers, retakes, trimmed material, etc. No, they are not remastered and there is no musical score (except where they show surrounding televised material for reference), but they are fun to see nonetheless. You will even hear Muffy the Mechanical Daggit as a chimp screech out and ruin a few takes (yes, Muffy was a chimp, the secret is out)!
There are also featurettes which highlight the memories of many of the surviving cast members (including the actors who portrayed Boomer, Starbuck, Apollo, Boxey, Cassiopiea, and others). These are well done and very viewable. Especially fun is the one on the Cylons (and how they could not see, so they kept falling over, tripping, running into things, etc). Lots of fun!
Don't be fooled. Yes, there are six discs, but several of the discs are two-sided, meaning you get upwards of 10 disc-worths of material in this set.
Also, you may be suprised that some of the larger stories are not divided up into their episodic release (at least, I did not notice any episodic breaks). For instance, Saga of a Starworld is presented as one long story (much longer than the theatrical movie release), but I believe (and correct me if I'm wrong) that this was how it was originally released on television back on that Sunday night in 1978 (a three hour TV Event Spectacular once you threw in commercials). In fact, I believe it was subsequently divided up into 3 parts for syndication purposes.
A booklet is also included in this oversized Cylon head box. No, the Cylon's eye on the box does not move back and forth electronically (it would be nice if it did). It is actually a reflective piece that does not really give much of an eye-movement effect. Anyway, the book is nice; it tells you where each of the stories can be found on the discs, gives a short plot synopsis of each story, and has some nice pictures.
What's fabulous about this set is that the sound has now been remastered for Dolby 5.1. No more mono tracks!!! Those of us who have been watching Battlestar Galactica for years have known how the sound (which could have been so rich and full) has been absolutely killed by being in mono. Well NO MORE! Now it is in surround!
Ah yes, there is a commentary track for Saga of a Star World as well (Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, and Herbert Jefferson Jr), and a special with Glen Larson... there is so much on this set, I haven't had a chance to absorb it all! It is definitely worth the wait; this is how a box set SHOULD be done as far as content! BUY IT!

STOP SUSAN WILLIAMS (begun at chapter 2)
THE SECRET EMPIRE (begun at chapter 3)
THE CURSE OF DRACULA (begun at chapter 6)
Only DRACULA, featuring Michael Nouri as, I believe, a handsome young Count running around in L.A., ever reached its conclusion.
I watched this as a kid and I still remember it as well. I hope that one day someone will release DVD's of all the obscure stuff. These shows are not making any money sitting on the shelfs in warehouses. Hope this information helps.",1065830400,,994,4.653409090909091
1489006,4,B00005JM3C,"An arousing epic, the most expensive and ambitious television show in history to that date. Unfortunately that enormous budget also contributed to its downfall. The most apparent problem was that, in order to keep budgets reasonable (under $1 million per episode!) they had to reuse spaceship fly-by's and battle scene SFX footage in episode after episode. It became nearly unbearable. I accept this as a necessary evil due to the sharp rise in expense of optical printing (the special effect that made spaceships ""fly,"" prior to the revolution of computer animation).

As I watch the episodes in adulthood I feel that it was a very good premise with great actors, great effects (for the time), great music, and a few great scripts. Dirk Benedict and Richard Hatch molded truly outstanding roles for themselves. Donald Bellisario (later the creator/writer of Magnum P.I., Airwolf, Quantum Leap and JAG), owes the beginnings of his career to this show, lending his exceptional writing talents to its better side. The cheesier side of Galactica was probably the handiwork of Glen Larson himself, the mastermind of the series. Larson is good at coming up with neat ideas and selling them to TV (not a small feat!), but he seems to like his science fiction with a healthy supply of cornballs. Larson would later launch the sequel series  Galactica 1980, featuring a ho-hum new cast that spent a large amount of time sneaking around on Earth in a series of silly low-budget adventures, disappointing even me as a kid. He would also bring us Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (which actually began with an almost adult tongue-in-cheek pilot in 1979, but quickly spiraled into a corny kiddy toon), Knight Rider (same pattern), and the failed Manimal series (anyone dare to remember this one?). Larson did accredit himself as composer of the theme to Battlestar Galactica with Stu Phillips, a pattern we would see also with Knight Rider and Buck Rogers, and if that's true, then he's very good at theme music. The Galactica theme is still among the best.

I feel it is worth it to buy the complete Battlestar Galactica series on DVD. I would NEVER buy Galactica 1980, and I would only consider Buck Roger's pilot, not the series. But Battlestar Galactica marks an important step in the evolution of science fiction television. And of course the series holds a lot of nostalgia for me.",1065830400,16,2374,4.915211970074813
1489007,3,B00005JM3C,"If you're of a certain age, the original first season of Battlestar Galatica has its charms. I watched the series as a kid and marveled at John Dykstra's visual effects (although after awhile they got boring and repetative as the same shots were frequently used again and again). The Cylons, while powerful villians, weren't all that threatening. They always lost and had no personality or charm (until the introduction of the late Jonathan Harris as one of them. He brought the same oily villiany and humor here as he did to Lost in Space).
The plot of the series borrowed from virtually every golden science fiction/space opera series of the 40's and 50's; A race of machines called The Cylons are at war with humanity. There are a number of those who believe that the overtures of peace are little more than an excuse to launch a surprise attack on the surviving fleet of battlestar cruisers. Among those skeptical of The Cylons are Lorne Greene. He's no longer on the Ponderosa but, instead, the commander of a Battlestar Cruiser as well as a leader of the planet. In a bid to finally wipe out humanity, The Cylons attack destroying the bulk of the remaining fleet and deceimating humanity's homeworld. Without the firepower or base of operations to fight back, humanity (lead by Greene and aided by his son Apollo played by Richard Hatch)flees searching for the lost tribe of humanity and the homeworld they established called Earth.
Galactica has more in common with the space opera elements used in Star Wars than current science fiction. The plots started off pretty promising. A number of talented writers (including Donald Bellasario the creator of Quatum Leap and Jag)got their start here. It's no wonder that Lucas sued Universal and Glenn Larson for ""borrowing"" his ideas; Galactica did borrow quite a bit but it just as readily borrowed from the space opera sagas of Larson's youth. To be fair, Lucas borrowed his ideas from classics ranging from Dune to the seminal space operas Flash Gordon and Buck Rodgers. I could see Larson's show as a homage to those classic serials like Flash Gordon that he, no doubt, grew up with as a kid as well. What probably influenced the Lucas and Fox to pursue it was John Dykstra's involvement and the design of the ships more than plotting similarities.
The first season showed the most dramatic flair both visually and narratively. Many of the seasons most powerful and dramatic episodes were based around quality guest stars like Patrick MacNee (in a marvelous turn as a Demon-like visitor).
Richard Hatch was always too stoic for my taste. He played the character of Apollo too straight and without much character or flavor. Dirk Benedict's knock off of Harrison Ford's performace of Han Solo had just the right amount of sarcasm to make the character and his performance work. The mix of Greek mythology with other myths and religious symbolism didn't always work but, well, a twelve year old kid wasn't likely to spot it.
Despite its considerable flaws, BG had charm at first. Like Lost in Space, it lost much of it as the season progressed. Why Sci-Fi Channel has chosen this series to remake is obvious; it's not too difficult to add a few post-modern touches and improve on the original model. Still, I have a little fond spot for the series (like most bad shows that knocked off popular movies, e.g. Planet of the Apes....which reminds me when is Logan's Run coming out on DVD?).
It's not good science fiction (or good storytelling)but all the cheesy elements work to the right degree. It's not the classic I had hoped for when I was a kid but, well, compared to most network television it at least looked good (back then). The packaging is really cool and I'm giving the boxed set an additional star for imaginative packaging).",1065830400,4,3787,4.800918836140888
1489008,5,B00005JM3C,"James J. Bell, you are thinking of the short-lived sequel series ""Galactica 1980"", which is NOT part of Battlestar Galactica. Also, you are mis-remembering. With the exception of one two-part episode, Starbuck was not in Galactica 1980; he was never on Earth.
Galactica 1980 lasted about 10 episodes and was deservedly cancelled, though if the dvd of it was sufficiently cheap I would buy it for completeness, as I am a Lorne Green fan, and several fo the new actors were good in their roles; it was the scripts that were super-cheesy.
Battlestar Galactica, on the other hand, while it had its cheesy scripts and cheap, rehashed special effects, was an excellent sci-fi drama. Two weeks is too long to wait for the dvd set.",1065744000,,723,4.792
1489124,2,B00005JM3C,"I recall reading somewhere that the orginal concept behind Battlestar Galactica was to recreate the 60's western series Wagon Train in outer space.  That show followed an Oregon bound wagon train and each week they had a new adventure on the trail.  That's pretty much what Battlestar Galactica viewers got...
Back when I was in the 6th and 7th grade, there really wasn't any good science fiction on TV.  When we finally got it, it came in the form of Space 1999, Buck Rogers and Battlestar Galactica.  All these shows were aimed at the kid's market and its a wonder they even showed these in prime time.  I think they may have done better on Saturday morning.
Of these three, Space 1999 is probably the most watchable as Sci fi- if you can buy into its stupid premise.  Buck Rogers was a product of the disco age - enough said.  Finally, there was Battlestar Galactica.
Battlestar Galactica started out strong, it had a good premise and the first half of the pilot movie was great.  Then they went an attached what should have been the first episode as the second half and ruined it.  It was a sign of things to come.  After that, it went down hill each week.  Apollo has a wild west gunfight.  Apollo and Starbuck attack the gun from Ice Planet Zero in a script that was like a demented cross fertilization of The Dirty Dozen and The Guns of Navarone. (Why were all those clones dressed like full sized Oompa Loompas?)  I hope they got sued for stealing ther people's ideas.  That said, there were a few good episodes too, Lloyd Bridges in the Pegasus episodes leap to mind so the series isn't 100 percent unwatchable.
Galactica 1980 was a wash, but by the time they made it they were playing for laughs.  I thought it was funny at the time, but it would have been better if all the original cast members had come back for it.
Here's the real deal.  The campy sci-fi value of this show is high.  If it is a part of your childhood, it might be worth the money but I think it has more ""warm memory value"" than real ""entertainment value.""  If you grew up on the sci fi that came to TV after Battlestar Galactica, the poor story lines and the overuse of stock footage of the space battles -used at least 10 times each episode- will drive you nuts.  Let's not let our childhood memories make a silk purse out of this sow's ear, I'll wait for all the suckers who buy it to sell theirs at a deep discount in two months.",1065657600,10,2414,4.360178970917226
1489125,5,B00005JM3C,"Am I the only guy that remembers the episodes when Starbuck & gang secretly landed on Earth?  They had motorcycles that could haul some serious butt and universal translators.  One scene that I have never forgotten involved a diner.  Starbuck was asked if he wanted some coffee.  They entered ""coffee"" into the translators and it read ""A warm beverage made from ground beans.""  Starbuck seemed to think that sounded disgusting and thus decided not to order coffee.  I have no idea how many ""Earth episodes"" were filmed, but I desperately want to see them again.  Also, if anyone remembers a mini-series called ""cliffhangers"" that showed 3 subplots (all ending in cliffhangers) per episode - please post the name - I have been looking for that forever!  Thanks.",1065484800,5,760,4.929133858267717
1489126,4,B00005JM3C,"Finally on DVD to take advantage of the Sci-Fi Channel's remake/mini-series. This is a must for the science fiction fan in your family. Especially if they were around back in 1978-79.
The Emmy Award winning special effects work, by John Dykstra, echoes closely what had been developed for ""Star Wars"" the year before. Stu Phillips great music added a certain majesty to the proceeding as well.
Let's face it, it was '70s TV though. Your memory may fool you into believing all manner of things about this show. The truth is that it was very good in it's time. And you'll get a great nostalgic feeling reliving all of that again. Plus, the box itself is quite a keepsake.",1064620800,8,669,4.630252100840337
1489127,4,B00005JM3C,"This really is a dream come true for us older SF fans who still remember those pre-VCR days when we faithfully parking ourselves in front of our tv sets every Sunday night at 8 o'clock sharp to watch our favorite show.
 I fully expect it to have lost some of it's appeal since those days in 1979. The stories and special effects to be a lot cheesier. But I'm willing to watch it again, even with it's many warts just for the chance to relive it all.
 Here's hoping that if it does well, Universal will consider giving a similar treatment to their less serious SF TV effort, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.",1064102400,13,606,4.307017543859649
1489128,5,B00005JM3C,"This was the best TV show of the 70s.  It came out right after the first Star Wars movie, and even uses some of the original props from that epic film.  The special effects were way too expensive for TV, which was the main reason the show was canceled.  Those of you whose imaginations have been hardened by CGI will probably not like it.  There are times you can even see the strings guiding the spaceships, and a contrast in color around the ships indicating how they were added in to the black backdrop of space.  For those who think CGI is a total copout on film making then you must see this.  These people were at least ten years ahead of their time with special effects.  The story is the equivalent of a sci-fi legend, ""space opera"" as Star Trek's Gene Roddenberry refered to it.  This is a story of apocalypse, the end and rebirth of all things.  There are lots of interesting references to ancient Earth culture, the Egyptians and Native Americans of North and South America.  There is also an underlying tone of religious significance since the villian is at the very least a demon set out to destroy humanity, and at the most the devil himself.  Each episode plays out like a mythological story, with heroes named Apollo and Starbuck.  What really brought the show together though was the soundtrack provided by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and composed by Stu Phillips.  He is TV's answer to John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith.",1063756800,11,1449,4.61328125
1489129,5,B00005JM3C,"Either you like Battlestar Galactica or you do not.  I love it!  The first episode was so epic!  Imagine, how on the eve of a peaceful settlement with the Cylons to have your worlds destroyed.  Imagine having to flee into the void of space just to survive.  If you can imagine and dream, you will love this.  If you are an non-imagining twit, you'd better go elsewhere.  If you love to dream and imagine, show this to your children and your friends!",1062806400,8,449,4.402439024390244
1489130,3,B00005JM3C,"How can you watch this series recycle the same 10-15 shots ad infinitum without wanting to send them your own cash to produce a new effect? With endless crash landings propelling plots stolen from famous movies and uniformly weak performances by all involved, there is a reason this series crash landed. It seems that the best kernels of ideas that this deritive series had to offer were all stolen from Star Wars: reckless flyboy Starbuck was TV's paper-thin answer to Han Solo; that hooey about the Lords of Kobol was a bizarre riff on the Force via the Mormon Church; the Cylons were chrome versions of the Stormtroopers; the Viper fighters were just X-Wings minus the upper half of the X. ABC fronted the cash for two episodes worth of John Dykstra's special effects then stretched those same shots through every episode that followed. It was a shame to see a potentially good idea (rebuilding a civilization destroyed by war on a new planet) reduced to painful cliches, overwrought dialogue, re-used special effects and group hugs in the end. This is television for the non-discriminating science fiction fan. It lasted only one season because it was patently awful television (one can't honestly consider Galactica 1980 as even related to BG) and because they couldn't afford not to use the same dogfight footage over and over again. Although I want to support BG out of nostalgia for my childhood (I never missed it, I used to draw pictures of it, I even wrote a little short story and script), I can also look at it as a grown-up. What a poorly executed squandering of time and talent with absolutely nothing to say about the human condition. Star Trek used its outer-space setting to comment on the times; Space: 1999 was admirable for its cult-like psychotronic plots; and Battlestar Galactica gave us Star Wars meets Bonanza by way of the LDS Church. There is no way the new Galactica can't improve on such thin source material. For all those who bellyache for a ""continuation"" of the old BG utilizing the same cast members, get out your wallets. This DVD set is for you.",1062201600,14,2082,4.770083102493075
1489131,5,B00005JM3C,"There are very few science fiction programmes or films I have ever watched with true enjoyment, and this is one of the finest examples.  This has appeared a number of times on TV in its edited versions (broadcast as ""films""), but the story lines in the edited versions have missed the point of story and plot development.  Each episode is linked from beginning to end, and as the series progresses, the viewer will be taken in by the developments that occur.  For those who have never seen this, I provide a brief description.
The story starts with the pilot episode in which a group of ships are heading towards a planet for a meeting on a peace treaty.  On their way, they are attacked by Sylons (robots controlled by an evil master).  The Galactica is the only surviving ship in this attack, and the remainder of the story unfolds to reveal how the enemy is defeated, and how Galactica attempts to reach its final destination - Earth.  There are twists, character developments, and a very original plot make this series a unique one and a classic.  I have not seen such a depth of story telling in any other science fiction programme or film.  The special effects for its time are far superior to Star Trek or Space 1999 (in my opinion, another classic).  The acting is superb.  I personally feel that Battlestar Galactica was grossly underrated, but I am glad to see that it is being released on DVD for the benefit of a new generation to enjoy.",1060732800,22,1449,4.55984555984556
1489132,4,B00005JM3C,"Yes there were good episodes and some bad ones. But what hurt the show was it's budget and it should had been a mini-series and not a regular TV show. But hats off to the fans including myself who never gave up on the show. I've also heard there are a number of episodes that were never seen by the fans which haven't been released and they are better than what aired on ABC-TV.If Battlestar Galactica makes a successful comback and it does even better than it did the first time around,then George Lucas should ask himself where did he went wrong with The Phantom Menance and Attack of the Clones.",1060732800,5,598,4.396396396396397
1489133,5,B00005JM3C,"...This will always be a classic Sci-Fi series and the absolute best from the 1970's, for me, personally.  I can always see the entire series, continuously, even though it's definately dated, especially considering Star Trek: The Next Generation series.  The series contains everything that a guy likes: action, romance -- especially consider Starbuck and Athena or Cassie and later that little spark or intonation of romance between Apollo and Sheba.  There is just one other point I must mention in regret about the series, its overt Mormon theology. But, Mormonism is considered by true Christians to be a cult because it lacks the true message of the Gospel, whereas, with Star Trek:TNG it's just rehashed New Age Theology, in other words just Near east Religions: Toaism, Buddist mixed into the Stories.  But by far, Nothing will ever come close to the original BsG Series, especially because that was the best Sci-Fi I grew up with as a teenager, along with Buck Rogers: in the 25th Century, a very close 2nd.  The stories were always so captivating and engrossing....",1060041600,23,1074,5.01123595505618
7939817,3,B00005JM3C,"This package consists of the original 1978-79 version.  The series was groundbreaking in its time, but the results were mixed.  Some of the issues trace back to the fact that it was originally designed to be a sequence of TV movies.  Shortly after the theatrical version was released, the network opted in favor of a weekly series, so the writers were working overtime, with the production on many episodes being rushed.  The basic storyline was like a Biblical epic in its conception.  The political subtext was conservative, with strong Cold War sensibilities, and frequent religious symbolism.  The good: the series was visually impressive, and there were a few outstanding episodes.  The bad: the script writing was intermittent, at best.  Many scripts were mediocre, some were terrible.  Several potentially good ideas were ruined with bad dialog and ludicrous plot twists.  Despite this, one of the enduring strengths of the series was that the characters were easy to identify with.  When the heroes prevailed, as they usually did, the effect could be quite uplifting.",1525996800,,1075,5.191860465116279
