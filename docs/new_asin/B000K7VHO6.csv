2683776,1,B000K7VHO6,"Please don't waste any money on this film.  The idea of the film is wonderful but it never delivers.  Between the bad acting and the deviations from scripture you hardly recognize the story at all.  The writer seems more interested in furthering his anti-Semitic cause then exploring race issues.  If you don't know anything about history, scripture or not really interested in either then you might get something out of it, otherwise skip it.  My only regret in that this movie bombed is that people may think that no one is interested in seeing biblical characters being portrayed as people of color when the truth is the movie is just bad.",1170547200,19,642,4.747747747747748
2683777,2,B000K7VHO6,"This movie is to focused on race. The one movie we get to see a black man depicted as jesus and it has to be the worst person I had ever seen to portray him. I am Glad this movie went unnoticed. Maybe a good production, starring a black man as Jesus, can be made.",1170201600,10,263,3.8
2683778,5,B000K7VHO6,It was a very good movie which chronicled the last 24 hours of Jesus and told the truth of hid lineage and color.  Too bad they didn't promote it in the theatres but I definitely supported the producer and director and thank them for having the courage to share the truth as I see it.,1170115200,5,284,4.163636363636364
2683779,5,B000K7VHO6,"I really enjoyed this movie. It really gave me a biblical view of the last 48 hours before Jesus was killed. The acting was great. It gave you the following views. 1. It had a scene with the Jewish high priest discussing about Jesus being the Messiah. 2. It had a multi-color cast of the disciples. 3. It had a scene with Judas betraying Jesus. 4. It had a scene with James the brother of Jesus. 5. It had a scene with Mary the mother of Jesus. 6. It had a scene with Peter saying that he would never deny Jesus. I really believe it identifies the cultural and the people who lived in the Middle East. We have to ask ourselves ""What was the Middle east called before 1948?"". It was the northeast part of Africa.  It is not strange for Jesus to have been dark skin because most people in Africa are.  If we leave the African presence out of the bible than how can we understand its  people and culture. There are Ethiopian Jews. It is a fact that they have the same DNA as the Jews in Jerusalem. Also words such as ""King of Kings and Lord of Lords"" is from Africa. Judaism is not a religion based on race. They did married other people.  When the church can accept its diversity than it can truly be universal. Salvation is not based on race, but it comes from God through Jesus Christ.  If Jesus is betrayed as black  or white we should not have a problem with it, because he saves.",1169510400,8,1382,4.19622641509434
2683780,1,B000K7VHO6,"The idea of Jesus being black is no more absurd than Jesus being a blue eyed blond. That is not the point. According to the New Testament Jesus of Nazareth was tried and convicted of blasphemy. He claimed to be God which really ticked off the religious leaders of the day. This film throws out that idea entirely and has Jesus being a victim of racial bigotry. The film also reports that the only reason that Jesus was born in a manger is because black folks were not welcomed at the Inn. It dosen't stop there. Jesus is crucified but is not raised from the dead. Just one more misunderstood black man who ain't coming back. This movie will likely appeal to those who are more interested in Tupac than Jesus. The film is the product of modern American political correctness rather than a depiction of Jerusalem 2000 years ago. The only way this could have been made worse if they had subtitled this ""Jesus--the Original Gangsta"".",1169337600,33,929,4.568862275449102
2683781,4,B000K7VHO6,"First things first, speaking as a man of African, European, and Native American descent...I appreciate this work of art not because it's one of the first theatrical releases based on the life of Christ depcting Him as a ""dark-skinned Nazarene,"" but because it, in my opinion, challenges the racial biases, mindsets, and walls that have divided Christians(and people in general for that matter) for ages with the depiction of Jesus Christ(bka Yeshua Ha Meshiach) as a Black Jew. Looking at other reviews, particularly those that renounce the possibility of Jesus being black as being a modern day invention and false, I have to disagree because there are mid-eastern people who are blacker than black, and it's a confirmed fact that there are Jews of darker shades (from Africa, Asia, India,etc), so I'm prompted to acknowledge the fact that this film also addresses the racial stigmas that exist within Judaism to this day(ie, Ethiopic Jews are not welcomed by some ""traditional"" Jews because they resemble the descendants of Cush or are accused of being halfbreeds like the Samaritans of Jesus' time who were half Jewish/half Babylonian). I feel that the question posed is whether or not the Church abroad would accept the 2nd coming if Jesus didn't share her racial features? If you ask me...we have a long way to go.

As far as my critique of the film, as is proposed, we have as good and classical a presentation of the life of Christ as ever, particularly His last 48 hrs(a la Passion of the Christ). I enjoyed the spin put on by the racial implications(not as overwhelming as I'd expected), I even enjoyed the fact that Joseph was alive throughout Jesus' ministry(it actually is disputed nowadays whether or not Jospeh died during Jesus' childhood as is traditionally taught),good acting, and a good Semitic feel. My only qualms are with the portrayal of Mary Magdala, yet again, as a prostitute by trade(via Pope Gregory's splicing together of accounts of women anointing Jesus' feet) and the fact that we see a Christ Who didn't seem to expect a resurrection...as a matter of fact, He doesn't resurrect in this film at all...I feel the resurrection of an ethnic Christ would've enhanced the message...that faith is more than skin deep. STILL...good movie, not for the religiously boxed-in or for the culturally biased. If your love for Christ is unconditional, you'll appreciate just because He's the Way. Out.",1168992000,7,2418,4.985148514851486
2683782,5,B000K7VHO6,"You are in store for a philsophical treat. The hook for me? Jesus as a black man. Although, it follows the same pre-cursor concept as previous ""jesus BC flicks, BC= before crucificion"", there is very little violence and those violent situational segments are in the movie at all. Making the movie more of a docudrama feel

Plus, the portrayal of Mary Magdalene as a opportunistic prostitute is a chauvinstic. This is a  shameful betrayal and to her. The actor playing jesus is very, very good. He exudes a concerned cerebral depiction. Focasing on jesus being the hated envy of the status quo and is conscious of the awful things they do to keep the hatred going..

I recommend this movie.  The movie's theme is humanitarian. Yes, the hook is the color thang. The greatness of the film is its intellectual handling of the project. ""Color of the Cross"" is a wonderful film for anyone who is religious. Oh yaeh, bring a hankie. It is a tear-jerker. Even for the fellas in the movie audience.

It seeks to show Jesus as an ordinary man who actually realize he is hated. He reasons to himself and attempts to persuade to his disciples that the manipulative conditions of the status quo's hatred is out of his hands because they need the meekness of the people to remain in power.

I think the filmmakers seeking to have the film make contemporary-sense to the viewers in this moderm- world. Trying to answer many reasons why all the crappola happened. Why he went through it and why he'd already known of its impending circumstances. A very good film for today's whites and especially today's blacks.",1166918400,16,1596,4.702508960573477
2683803,3,B000K7VHO6,"The acting ranges from decent to good. The cinematography is quite indie. The pacing is a bit slow, so I recommend this movie to people who are already familiar with Jesus' story and Holy Spirit. This is no evangelism film. It probably won't convict sinners, but it does show the heart of Jesus' interactions with His disciples (my favorite part). Other than the ""shocking"" Black Jesus angle, ""Color of the Cross"" is actually pretty faithful to Scriptures. After purchasing this, I realized that I already purchased it years ago (before salvation), but never watched it.

It was fine to have Jesus portrayed by a black man and the acting was fine, but bringing race into his ministry, death and resurrection renders his actions almost meaningless.  No matter his color, Jesus was killed because he said he was God and lived and did things in accordance with that.

I respected Jean-Claude ever since I first saw him playing a role in Malcom X.  Yet, after this film I cannot help but feel saddened by his efforts.  After all these years, is Jesus' death for the sins of mankind to be cheapened by the result of racial discrimination?  The movie did not give an accurate portrayal of the events that led to the death of Jesus Christ.

2683856,1,B000K7VHO6,"Yes, there was racism played out in Jesus' death. But because he was Jewish and the Greeks and Romans hated the Jews, especially one who claimed to be the King of Kings.  The Greek and Roman kings declared that they were God and were worshiped by their subjects.  If not, they would be killed.  Well, here comes Jesus, not only Jewish, but claiming to sit on a throne higher than theirs.  So Jesus was indeed a threat.  That's why they killed him.  Because bottom line, he called for everyone, kings included, to worship the one true God.  Jesus WAS dark skinned, but because he was Jewish.  He could have been purple for all I care.  But it is important to understand that Jesus said he is for ALL people.  We don't have to mess with biblical facts in order to believe in his love and redemption for ALL people.  Just accept him as he is, don't go trying to change the truth in order to make him more palatable or stylish.",1184371200,3,923,4.3391812865497075
2683857,5,B000K7VHO6,"This movie lives up to its promotion attributes and not only LaMarre, but the entire cast is hereby Heralded.  It is an excellent film and should be widely viewed by the general public. It is very unfortunate and very sad that many of our people and people in general gave the movie negative reviews.

Those that issued such negative reivews are totaly unaware that the European Academy recast the entire Bible into a saga of European people.

The result has been the creation of a world in which too many Blacks themselves have become uncomfortable with images of biblical characters as Blacks.  Despite all of the evidence that indicates a manifest black biblical presence, Euro centric church officials and scholars have tended to deny or minimize the fact that black people are in any part of the Bible itself, a tendency that has had gave consequences for persons of African descent(Original African Heritage Study Bible).

2683858,2,B000K7VHO6,"Jean-Claude La Marre has brought a new vision of Christ to the screen, and for this he should be applauded. Presenting Jesus as a black man, invites a whole host of questions about how much God understands the suffering of all people. However, I did not feel the issue of black suffering was dealt with as much as it could have been. I think that rather than re-tell the Gospel account of Jesus' last 48 hours by simply putting a black man into Jesus' shoes, it might have made for a more interesting (and thought-provoking) film to begin with a discussion of how blacks have suffered at the hands of (Christian) whites over the years, and then consider how this would have impacted on Jesus if he had been black (or stood in the shoes of black people who have suffered). I applaud the decision to present Jesus as a black man, but as this was simply a re-telling of the story we know there was absolutely no way the issue of race and racism could be explored in any real depth. Although it was stated on the DVD cover that this film would suggest that the Crucifixion was racially motivated, this was not actually brought out in the film. A few scattered references to Jesus being black and having black parents, does not make the Crucifixion a race-issue. In fact, by the end of the film I was actually left with the impression that Jesus was still put to death for claiming to be Messiah, but just happened to be black!

One line that was repeated in the film twice, was the following:

'In my father's eyes we are all different, yet we are all the same.'

If this was supposed to the central theme of the film, it was lost on me. If anything, I felt anti-Semitism was a key theme in the film, rather than Jesus' blackness! As a good example of how the issue of racism was not tackled in the film, one of the disciples began to recount the story of The Good Samaritan, yet was stopped by one of the others (because the 'master tells better stories). This was a shame, as this story/parable is not just a lesson about treating your neighbour well, but also addresses the matter of racism. For it was the despised (half-cast) Samaritan, who Jesus told his Jewish audience to be the one acting well, rather than the Jewish religious leaders passing by the man in need. Now here was an opportunity to discuss the matter of race and racism in the context of the biblical teaching, yet it was lost for the sake of a mediocre 'joke'.

In terms of the technical aspects of the film, the DVD cover describes this film as 'epic'. Now with a 2.5 million dollar budget, there was certainly a descent amount of money attached to this project, but I am not sure this is reflected in the overall look of the film, such as to describe it as 'epic'. Certainly there are some good-looking moments in the film, but most of the time the set-design and costumes looked a little too faux-first century for my taste. Also, there was a lot of woodenness in much of the acting. Some performances were painful at times, and even Jean-Claude La Marre seemed a little unsure about how to play the 'Son of God'. Certainly his scene in Gethsemane is an example of over-acting par excellence! There were also some moments where the direction seemed questionable (i.e. choice of camera angle), and editing was choppy in some places leading to a significant drop in tension and narrative (when the opposite effect was clearly being sought).

I think this was a brave film, but in the end a lost opportunity. There are some nice moments in it (E.g. where Jesus washes the disciples' feet, no matter what their skin colour is), but far too much of the time seemed to be spent on lesser issues. If this was a film designed to provoke a thoughtful response about black suffering, then for me it needed more than just a black actor playing Jesus and various black actors crying at his Crucifixion. Some actual discussion of this matter during the course of the film would have been nice too!",1179360000,,3956,4.48127600554785
2683879,3,B000K7VHO6,"Readers, I tried to look at this with an open mind and objective perspective.  I ignored the fact that the Jesus story was racially painted.  I ignored some of the subpar acting and dialog.  I ignored accuracy of events.  In other words, I really expected and wanted to like this movie.  However, it was very difficult to watch...even from an entertainment point of view (not that Jesus is supposed to be entertaining, but hopefully you readers know what I mean).  The one accolade I can give is that the creator Jean-Claude LaMarre had the ambition to cast a mostly African-American cast.

Still, although I didn't expect a documentary, the problem with this movie is that it is a fundamentally lacking story of Jesus.  They could have casted Korean, Latino, or other ethnic actors in it and tailored the story appropriately...but from all Biblical accounts it would still be lacking.

To put it bluntly, it wasn't even a good Jesus highlight film.  It was very disjoint in parts, making it was difficult to watch.  Even more disappointing was that this movie had all the potential to still tell the Jesus story of redemption and salvation, with an African-American cast to boot.  But, after viewing this, one doesn't leave this movie with a better understanding of Jesus' purpose.

Hypothetically, even if the ethnic racism spin were true, this movie still didn't cover adequately who Jesus was and why He transcended race/ethinicity for all mankind.  Not only that, but the true legacy of any Jesus story is what He did AFTER the crucifixion.  Instead, this movie treats His death as the end of the story and ends with retrospectives of the Last Supper and other scenes.

Even writing this review is difficult because how can you say something bad about a Jesus story?  So I write this only as a warning to those who are thinking about buying this.  Buy it for your collection if you must, but PLEASE read the Bible for a fuller and more character developed story about Jesus.",1178755200,12,1979,4.787610619469026
2683880,4,B000K7VHO6,"Most reviews of this film seem stuck on the low budget (although it probably cost a lot more than The Gospel According to St. Matthew, a masterpiece) and the indifferent acting (although the performances are much better than those in The Jesus Film, purportedly the most widely seen movie of all time). Get over it. I think The Color of The Cross is challenging, delightfully quirky, and not afraid to be in-your-face wrong. In otherwords, it's everything Jesus movies don't dare to be.

While the movie does not really depict Jesus' death as racially motivated (he's still killed for blasphemy, although his color does disqualify him to be the messiah in the eyes of some Jewish authorities) it does deal with race in a way that's challenging and brazenly anachronistic. Mary gave birth in a stable because, it turns out, she's the victim of first-century Jim Crow. There's lots of shock about Jesus being black, and what that all means. Scholars pretty much agree that this kind of skin-color-based racism is a much later development in human civilization (nobody seemed to care that St. Augustine was black). Nevertheless, a black Jesus hanging on the cross does invite us to compare crucifixion and lynching -- two forms of public execution designed to terrorize the oppressed.

Race issues aside, there's plenty of other quirky stuff in this movie that make it puzzling and memorable:

1) Jesus' death does not take place in Jerusalem, but someplace called ""Arimithea"" (not Arimathea), a place where Joseph, Mary and the rest of Jesus' family live. The Romans go from the house of the Last Supper to Joseph and Mary's, looking for Jesus and busting up everybody's Seder.

2) James, the brother of Jesus, is not one one of his disciples, but Joseph has big plans for him anyway. ""Your time will come,"" he tells a guilt-ridden James. This is obviously a veiled hint at James the Just's leadership of the Jerusalem church. It also suggests Joseph has a dynasty in mind.

3) Mary Magdalene, a devotee of Jesus, is nevertheless still a working prostitute. She turns an (off camera) trick with Judas after the Last Supper to give Jesus time to escape!

4) During the Last Supper the director montages from Jesus' Seder to that of the Holy Family, and then that of a number of Sanhedrin priests, reinforcing the message that these are all Jews, with a common religious tradition and values. It's a shocking transition, because it forbids us to see the priests as mere ""bad guys,"" in the fashion of nearly every other Jesus movie and, alas, the Gospels themselves. Scenes like these -- and the elimination of the entire trial sequence -- seem to argue against any anti-semitic motive behind this movie.

5) During Jesus' agony in the garden, he has a vision of three moons which obviously terrifies him. What's up with this? It's never explained.

There are many other strange innovations in The Color of the Cross. The movie is disturbing and thought-provoking, although it never comes close to being Oscar material. But for those interested in the modern meaning of the Jesus story, or just interested in the history of the cinematic portrayal of that story, it's a must-see.",1177459200,5,3174,4.864814814814815
2683881,1,B000K7VHO6,"This movie was awful.

Every bit of the acting was awful.

The charachters were undeveloped.  The disciples were too militant!

The plot was completely RIDICULOUS! The movie focused solely on the Romans search for the ""Black Nazarene"", and none of Jesus' teachings or miracles were touched on. When Mary asked Joseph, ""Do they want to kill him because he's black!!!!"" ended it for me.  The rest of the movie from that point was garbage.  Someone mentioned that the Ressurection should have been touched on, too.  All I have to say in response to that (and in response to my OWN review) is that you can't really delve into the more pertinent aspects of the life of Jesus because this movie so poorly focused on race.  This was trash!

I have no problem with modernizing historical stories (prime examples Romeo and Juliet, and Othello), but to add a modern ""controversy"" and keep all other aspects of the story the same just didn't work for me.

The best part of the movie to me is the Final Supper.  I bought this yesterday off of amazon on accident so I'm going to return it without opening it and get my money back.  This was an AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL movie.",1175731200,2,1161,4.555555555555555

2683883,5,B000K7VHO6,"As a low budget film ""Color of the Cross"" was excellently done.  Has great acting. As with all directors, there is some dramatization of the original story, but La Marre does stay close to the Scripture.

The inference that the crucifixion of Jesus was ALSO racially motivated is NOT out of the realm of possibilities.  The most significant color of the cross, however, is still RED; ""for without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin"". (Hebrews 9:22)",1174867200,,464,4.775
2683884,1,B000K7VHO6,"Its not the idea that Jesus was a man of color, there are clear indications that he might have been. Its the ridiculous notions and ""creative liberty"" that is taken with the scripture. I am so upset and hurt by this sinful depiction of Jesus, his disciples and the events leading up to his death.

Sure, if he was black I truly believe that the crucifixion had something to do with him being black, but the reality is that there is no scriptural proof that Judas raped Mary or that Mary was ""in love"" with Jesus or that Jesus was a man of worry, fear or indifference.

It is these types of destructive ""interpretations"" that lead people astray. I am also disgusted that Bishop Jakes was so money motivated that he would allow his movie to be a preview on something that  so obviously nullifies scripture for self interpretation and profit.",1174176000,7,839,4.543046357615894
2683885,4,B000K7VHO6,This movie is told from a very different point of view of why Jesus was not accepted as the Savior of the Jews. The movie gave me something to think about.,1173916800,,155,4.032258064516129
2683886,1,B000K7VHO6,I think if you are sincerely looking for an experience of the Cross and the Christ of the Cross you should not spend one cent on this DVD,1172448000,7,137,3.9285714285714284
2683887,4,B000K7VHO6,"I loved this DVD - the alternative representation of Jesus as a black man was unique and thought-provoking. The movies' portrayal was a good one - and it lets you know that racism was alive and well a long, long time ago. Quite the eye-opener - that Jesus would have been treated badly because of his color and not just his message. Makes you think...and it's rather sad that things still haven't changed much.",1171929600,6,410,4.554054054054054
