8031646,5,B0002T8C4K,"Felix the Cat is by far my favorite cartoon character; he was created by Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer and named ""Master Tom"" in 1919 for ""Feline Follies,"" and in 1924 he was re-named Felix, and became the first animated superstar. I love the surrealism of the early silent b&w animation for the Sullivan Studios, and when the Van Beuren Studios took Felix over in 1936, the storytelling and art of Felix changed, but didn't diminish. We get 1 example of the former, and 2 of the latter in this DVD collection, and they are wonderful. Another big favorite of mine is ""The Sunshine Makers,"" an oddball cartoon also from the Van Beuren Studios. Total running time is 65 minutes.

Episode list:

1: ""Felix the Cat and the Goose"" (1936), directed by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer, music by Winston Sharples for the Van Beuren Studios. Felix and Goldie the Goose are very philanthropic with their golden eggs, until Goldie is goosenapped by Captain Kidd. Felix to the rescue!

2: ""April Maze"" (1930), directed by Pat Sullivan for the Sullivan Studios. Felix takes Inky and Dinky for a picnic, but they are hounded by storms. Includes a dancing bear and a snake charming rabbit that try to steal the picnic basket.

3: ""Neptune Nonsense"" (1936), directed by Burt Gillett and Tom Parker for the Van Beuren Studios. Great underwater animation as Felix tries to search for a mate for his pet goldfish Annabelle.

4: ""Chicken a la King"" (1936), directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Dave Tendlar and Nicolar Tafuri, music by Sammy Timberg and Bob Rothberg for the Fleischer Studios. A hilarious chicken harem, with the Arabian rooster falling for Duckie Wuckie, a scintillating duck modeled after Mae West. Lots of singing and dancing in this one.

5: ""Cobweb Hotel"" (1936), directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Dave Tendlar and William Sturm, music by Sammy Timber and Bob Rothberg for the Fleischer Studios. Flies get trapped in Mr. Spider's Hotel, but Mr. and Mrs. Fly check in for their honeymoon, and fight back!

6: ""The Fresh Vegetable Mystery"" (1939), directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Dave Tendlar and William Sturm for the Fleischer Studios. Veggies come to life in this imaginative cartoon. Color is quite washed out in this episode.

7: ""Greedy Humpty Dumpty"" (1936), directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Dave Tendlar and William Sturm for the Fleischer Studios. Humpty Dumpty's greed is his doom when he desires the gold in the sun. Lots of song and dance in this episode.

8: ""Farm Foolery"" (1949), directed by Seymour Kneitel, animated by Al Eugster and Bill Hudson, music by Winston Sharples for the Famous Studios. A farm animal sing-along as they sing ""Shine on Harvest Moon"" and provide lots of sight gags.

9: ""The Sunshine Makers"" (1935), directed by Ted Eshbaugh for the Van Beuren Studios. Happy gnomes are happy because they have discovered how to bottle sunshine. They pelt a neighboring town of gloomy gnomes with the bottles, and then everyone is happy. Fantastic animation in this gem, and though the color does not have the vibrancy it should, and I have seen better transfers, it is still terrific.

10: ""Picnic Panic"" (1935), directed by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer for the Van Beuren Studios. Molly Moo Cow made her screen debut in this episode that is part live action, featuring some children, and kettles, teapots and cups.",1125878400,9,3360,4.87719298245614
