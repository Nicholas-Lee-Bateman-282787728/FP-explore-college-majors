7373827,4,B013W7LTL6,"Watched a few scenes from the movie for a work training course. Made me want to see the whole thing. I think it is a well done movie, shows how an experiment can't get out of hand.",1513555200,,180,3.891891891891892
7373828,5,B013W7LTL6,"There are quite a few movies inspired by the actual Stanford Prison Experiment that Dr. Zimbardo conducted, Das Experiment is a great one, but that one is fiction, this one is real. The doctors picked mentally healthy individuals and chose the role of prisoner and guard by coin toss. It's interesting that none of the prisoners wanted to be guards, but once the guards got their nightsticks, uniforms, sunglasses, they changed. One was particularly cruel and the others soon followed.

The prisoners itself changed. What began as a joke, quickly became real. Here we see a wide range of human behavior, from those who comply to those who rebel, from those who abuse their authority to others who know the limits. My favorite character was Zimbardo's civilian consultant, a man who did 16 years in San Quentin, a real prisoner. The parole scene is particularly compelling, specially when later on he says he wasn't acting, but doing exactly what was done to him.

The movie doesn't really explain what was the point of the experiment, so I had to search elsewhere. Apparently, the point is that it's not a rotten apple who spoils the bunch, but the system, the situation, the environment. Basically, anyone can become evil under the right circumstances. It's reminiscent of Hanna Arendt's books, ""The Banality of Evil,"" about how Adolph Eichmann wasn't really a monster but the everyday German, doing his job, following orders.",1505260800,,1427,4.991596638655462
7373829,3,B013W7LTL6,"Although I've since changed careers rather significantly, I am a theater graduate and spent years working in theater.  My strongest feeling while watching STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT was ""this could easily have been a play rather than a movie and it would have been 10x more powerful.""  It is already a story mostly confined to a tiny area, and it features almost nothing in the way of cinematic artistry.  The acting, while often good, is mostly pitched at a slightly exaggerated level that would work much better on stage.  The dialogue is a bit ""stagey"" too.  And things like cinematography are uninspiring and unrevealing.

BUT, it isn't a play...it's a low-budget movie with an interesting cast, an interesting story and a deep, deep need for an editor.  The film runs just over 2 hours, and should EASILY have come in at 90 minutes.  In case you don't know, this is a true story, about a 1971 ""experiment"" conducted by a Stanford research psychologist in 1971.  He hired a bunch of students (at $15 per day) to take on the role of either prisoner or guard.  Other than telling the guards they couldn't physically hurt anyone...they could pretty much do what they wanted.  The scariest thing the experiment teaches is not that under these circumstances, the guards might be come cruel and the prisoners terrified and dehumanized.  It's HOW FAST it all happens.  The movie also shows what a horribly conceived experiment it was, and how terribly the psychologist and his colleagues got sucked into playing their own ""roles"" in this scenario.  It's pretty amazing that people didn't go to jail and the looney bin for this little game.

The young men are played by a wide variety of interesting actors such as the always good Tye Sheridan (MUD) and the fascinating Ezra Miller (WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN).  Miller is a pretty compelling and interesting film actor, but in this project, he's just a bit over the top.  His character's arc is clumsily written, granted, but he could have overcome this better.  He's a great example of what I said above...if this same performance were transported to a theatre with an audience of about 900, it would be thrilling.  Here, where we can see him up close, it's just a bit too much.  Billy Crudup, as the shrink, perhaps fares best of all because he doesn't forget that in film, less is often more.  He does a convincing job portraying a man who fools himself into thinking his ""game"" is advancing human knowledge in a useful way, and not just destroying the psyches of all involved.

It's not a FUN movie to watch...and many of the scenes of tormenting the prisoners drag on too long or are too repetitive.  It's as though the director and writer thought they had to make their point over and over and over.  It just became a bit mundane.  (Perhaps that was the point...but what it really did was kind of grind the momentum to a halt after the film gets of to a brisk start.)  This is worth seeing, but it's also not the earth-shattering revelation it wants to be.

(PS, if you have time, watch the two brief little documentaries [less than 15 minutes total].  You'll meet the ""real life"" main character.)",1504224000,,3151,4.6903460837887065

7373831,5,B013W7LTL6,"In 1971, Dr. Phillip Zimbardo converted the basement of the Stanford University psychology building into a jail in an effort to study the psychology of prison life. 24 students were randomly chosen to be either a prisoner or a guard. The experiment ended after only 6 days and has become a psychology touch stone on the power of authority and abuse. Sound interesting? I certainly thought it was!",1502928000,,396,4.838235294117647
7373832,5,B013W7LTL6,If you're skeptical about this movie I would definitely say go for it! After learning about this experiment in psychology I was very interested and the movie held up.,1502323200,,166,4.758620689655173
7373833,3,B013W7LTL6,"It's a decent portrayal of the actual experiment.  I was looking forward to more in-depth discussions about the observations, results, and conclusions.  This film really only scratches the surface of a very important historical experiment.",1499817600,,239,5.8
7373834,5,B013W7LTL6,"As a psych major, I learned the basics of this infamous experiment early on - that is to say, I do not know the minute details, only the outcome.  This film captures the essence of what I know.  I think much of the design of this experiment relies on Hannah Arendt's description of the evils of Nazi Germany being carried out by men who showed ""the banality of evil"" - the boring nature of someone like Adolf Eichmann, a mastermind of ""the Final Solution"".  Zimbardo was curious to see what regular people would do when either given great power or denied it.  By every stretch, he succeeded in showing what run-of-the-mill folks can become and the shock to the psychological establishment exists to this day.  Social psychology experiments are practically taboo in this country because of this and a couple of other trials that left behind negative outcomes.  This is too bad - social psych is a rich field that says a great deal about who we are - biologically, neurologically, temperamentally - so we look overseas for experimentation that can be carried out humanely.  I've gone on about the subject at length; the film is written, acted and directed in a reverential manner as it should be - this remains an experiment considerably more valuable than much of Freud's work.  Particularly effective is the performance given by Nelsan Ellis as an ex-con who consults on the project.  More than anyone else, he scrutinizes and dismisses the prisoners only to come to the realization that he is just like his former captors.  He stands out but he doesn't diminish the other well-cast, well-done acting.  Really, a film to benefit all.  Much of the time we spend deluded, believing we could never carry out the atrocities we too often read about.  But how do we know?  Did the SS guards at Auschwitz, as children, as young adults, think they would do the galling things they did?  This film orients the psyche to look in at itself.  I recommend we do so before...",1498867200,,1961,4.706744868035191

7373848,1,B013W7LTL6,"I was skeptical before I even began watching, but gave it a chance regardless. Later, I only kept watching in the hopes that before it was over, someone would break the jaw of the one guard they called ""John Wayne"" but who bore a more striking resemblance, in more ways than one, to Charles Manson. I was also hoping to see an epilogue which told of how the good ""doctor"" who ran this sideshow was stripped of his teaching credentials, at the very least.

From the beginning, it was an idiotic experiment, with an inevitable conclusion that wouldn't take a psychic to predict, but the great Stanford professor of psychology was too thick headed to realize that the ultimate result of his ""experiment"" could be predicted by anyone with half a brain who had any experience with human nature. The only real question to be resolved by his little personal circus was how far would it go before someone finally pulled the plug. Somewhat ironically, just weeks after this experiment was terminated, inmates at Attica prison in New York state demonstrated quite vividly just what could happen when prison guards abused their authority and prisoners reached the breaking point. If the good ""doctor"" at Stanford wanted to study something, he should have studied that event, rather than patting himself on the back for creating a tempest in a teapot and then trying to compare it to a tornado. If you put a rat in a maze, the experiment loses much, if not all, of its value if rat knew from the beginning that it was going to be put in a maze, that it would not be allowed to remain trapped in the maze indefinitely, and that no harm would come to it as a result of being ""stuck"" in the maze, should it fail to find its way out.",1488499200,,1717,4.538709677419355

7373856,5,B013W7LTL6,I am familiar with the Stanford Prison Experiment because I read about it when I was working on my psychology degree. But seeing it portrayed was very disturbing. How the experiment plays out with normal college kids  abusing their power so quickly resulted in me wanting to know more about that.  So I putchased the book The Lucifer Effect  which delves more deeply not just into the experiment but how average people can turn from  being good to doing evil.

I recommend the movie, but i would never watch it more than once.  there is no need.  there is something so unbelievably disturbing about the idea that someone who is given *power* (when in actuality i think that really they are supposed to be entrusted and obligated to protect) over the lives of others....could so horrifically abuse it...just to see how far they can go.  the idea that we have the ability, at the drop of a hat, to dehumanize people so readily....and anyone can fall in to this trap...we just don't know until faced with it....and that others fall in line and allow it to happen.

these kids were not criminals and so it sort of makes it all worse...but even still, at what point do we have the right to treat someone like they are a monster?  does someone who rapes, tortures..murders...deserve to be treated with respect and kindness?...does fear mongering really help any given situation? i don't know.

i walked away from this movie feelings depressed and sick to my stomach...to date the only other movies i can think of that made me feel this badly are *an american crime* and *the elephant man*",1472601600,4,1269,4.588495575221239

I like the movie, but if this accurately portrays the events, I have lost all respect for Phillip Zimbardo and Stanford University. Both should have been sued. Any competent lawyer should have come to the legal aid to seek recompense for breech of contract and recompense for tort. The guards were not to touch the prisoners; they did so repeatedly and violently and even sprayed a carcinogenic fire extinguisher spray in their faces. Philip G. Zimbardo and his fellow researchers observed this, knew it, tolerated it, and relented only when one of the 'prisoners' in the study demanded a lawyer. Both Philip G.

It was carried out by Dr. Zimbardo (Billy Crudup  Sleepers and Spotlight) who was assisted by a number of academic and non academic colleagues. The results were surprising to say the least and this film seems to stick very closely to the events and what actually occurred.

The brilliant Michael Angarano (Gentlemen Broncos) plays the rather nasty Christopher Archer aka John Wayne who was the most notorious of the guards and he plays the part with real gusto. There are some scenes that some may find upsetting but everything depicted here pretty much happened and this makes this telling have more of an impact than such fictional accounts as say the German film, Das Experiment that was remade in America.

7373948,4,B013W7LTL6,"This is a fictional movie loosely based on a real life psychological experiment back in 1971, conducted at Stanford University on students who volunteered for cash ($15 a day in this movie version) to be in a prison simulation.  They would either be made guards or prisoners. In this movie everyone wants to be a prisoner since they thought it would be more fun or that people don't like guards (remember this was the early 70's in an era of protests against authority) and reasons like this.  However at the flip of a coin in most cases, half became guards.  The guards could go home at the end of their shifts, but the prisoners couldn't leave the faculty offices (converted into cells) for the entire two weeks.  The students would quickly find out that being a prisoner wasn't any fun at all, as the guards, led by a psychopath wannabe in both the day and night shifts, would out compete each other to see who could make the prisoners lives more hell than the other group. Especially particular prisoners who resisted, questioned them or didn't respect their authority.

The outcome of the experiment questions do people become meek and submissive if degraded (assuming they don't have a mental breakdown as two did) like the prisoner students were in this film. Also if you give someone power over someone with no consequences, will they turn into what the guards were in this film? I don't know much about the real life events, but for me with this movie version, I wondered if the guards hadn't of consisted of the two sadistic students, who became unofficial shift leaders, one a clearly small framed kid who probably got bullied during his entire education up to this point who was trying to be a character from his favourite film Cool Hand Luke, if you would have actually gotten the same results?  I also was constantly thinking the prisoner students only stayed and put up with abuse because they desperately needed the $15 from each day (which was obviously the equivalent of a lot more money now).

It's an interesting movie, disappointingly it sums everything up in text boxes at the end rather than having included those scenes in the film itself but overall it's not bad, and makes me want to check what actually happened in the real life study.",1463529600,2,2262,4.696969696969697

Michael Angarano absolutely steals the movie as a sadistic prison guard. He immerses himself in a character that is, himself, immersed in a character. He owns the screen every time he's on it in this movie.

This movie is a really fascinating look into the psychology of authority, mob mentality and cruelty. In one of the recreated interviews at the end of the movie, the sadistic prison guard is asked by one of the prisoners (after the experiment has ended), why he was so cruel and ""imaginative"" in his punishment of the prisoners. He almost smugly replied (paraphrasing), ""Because nobody told me I couldn't. Nobody stopped me.""

7374006,5,B013W7LTL6,"Its one of the most brilliant films I ever saw.  everyone is raised with the idea that police are good people arrested are guilty and the criminal justice system is fair.  The american criminal justice system has its heritage based in the salem witch trials.  That we put to death 19 women and one man for witchcraft is not a historical comedy, its indicative of what we still do.  Accused rapists exonerated with dna evidence.  a man in texas executed for arson when the flash was caused by his entering the house to save his daughters.  The guilty and the honest are treated the same, the chinese way:  confess for reniency!  the one woman who admitted witchery was the servant of one of the families having the feud that lead to the accusations.  And in that tragedy is our modern justice system.  The threat of punishment so severe that even the innocent will admit guilt just to avoid the consequences of not confessing.  The dynamic set up between the guards and inmates is exactly what happens on the streets with police and citizens.  Those in control with the power use it to their own end and pleasure while feeling they are doing the right thing by dehumanizing others.  It is bullying true to form and disgustingly accurate on how police really treat people when no one is looking",1453161600,2,1292,4.614035087719298

And I would have preferred to view the original documentary, because there is a cinematic quality to this film that both helps and hinders it.  Hinders because its larger than life.  But helps because it brings a larger audience to an historical incident from which we can learn a great deal.

Most of us have some previous knowledge of the Stanford Experiment, but I was surprised to see some of the details, which a Wiki reading seemed to corroborate.  My background and experience are partly in psychology, but I had not realized the unethical dimensions of this experiment and the man in charge.  The way that Zimbardo injected himself into his research was highly inappropriate and unprofessional and its surprising that he has not been evaluated less kindly by peers.  If the movie is accurate, the professor revealed more about himself than anyone else.  The fact that he allowed the original experimental parameters to be violated, and then encouraged even more aberrant behavior is unconscionable.  And there was a disturbingly voyeuristic quality to his participation, at least in the film.

Another reviewer mentioned that the post-experimental therapeutic reconditioning of the subjects was insufficient.  Id like to add that the guards certainly required reentry therapy as well as the prisoners.  These young men were on the way to developing a frighteningly abusive aspect of personality.

There is still a lot to take from TSPE, and there are a lot of questions to ask.  Such as would using another demographic have made a difference in the research?  Young male students are used to treating each other that way and taking a fair amount of abuse and giving it too.  And they certainly weren't street-hardened.  And it was the Seventies.

Also, not to nit-pick, but Im tired of hearing how people have been characterized via such experiments.  Half of the population was not used.  Many women would have likely reacted very differently . . . it would have been interesting to test, anyway.  Not that women cant be fierce and/or victimized, but they usually have different ways of coping and working in group situations.  Thats why it was a shock for America to watch the errant female soldier in the Abu Ghraib incident.  There are always exceptions to the general rule.  But it took a woman in TSPE to intervene and end the debacle, which is telling.

And my first impression while watching the experiment itself was that the one student guard who took a leadership role was a sadistic outlier.  The other guards seemed more reluctant to get carried away, but had to take orders from him.  The professor should have been concerned right then about the validity of generalizing the research.  And the fact that the prisoners went in originally knowing that it wasn't real and that they weren't in danger meant that they baited guards early on and artificially escalated the situation.

Regardless of this mess of an experiment, it remains astonishing that some humans can so quickly and intensely adopt such attitudes and begin to hallucinate their roles believably.  At least we can conclude that there is a danger in allowing situations to develop in which authority can be abused (including research experiments).  Even if a few bad apples are necessary to initiate trouble, it can go viral quite easily.  Sometimes safeguards are necessary to protect society from ourselves.

Four stars for a movie that frankly, seems to be a closet expose of Dr. Zimbardo, a researcher who got caught in a web of his own making.",1452816000,,3573,4.941275167785235

The film seemed well made, the acting was very good by all parties.  The acting was so good, it was easy to forget that you were watching a movie recreation of the experiment.  One thing that struck me immediately after watching:  I would never want to watch it again, and I don't think many people would, it's just one of those types of films.

The experiment and it's results are surprisingly interesting in regards to psychology and sociology, some people might even call it groundbreaking, but unfortunately the film didn't spend much time discussing the broader implications or the findings and research after the experiment.  I was expecting and hoping for some intellectual debriefing and reflection after 40+ years since the experiment took place. Maybe the book covers that, I have not read it, but the film doesn't give those areas adequate treatment, hence the 3 stars and the title of this review.",1451952000,10,1053,4.882022471910112

7374021,4,B013W7LTL6,"A bit of an enigma.  The cast is terrific, its directed and edited artfully and intelligently, and it never falls into what would have been easy exploitation or exaggeration of a true event.  Indeed, whole sections of the screenplay were taken from the actual transcripts.  Yet somehow this reenactment of psychologist Dr. Philip Zimbardos famous 1971 experiment - where students played prisoners and guards, and quickly the roles started taking over until things got out of hand - is less chilling and powerful than what I expected.

Having seen an educational documentary that included excerpts from the tapes of the actual experiment, I found the film just couldn't match the power of the real thing, in spite of tons of talent and good intentions.  I was always aware these were actors and I was watching a movie.

That said, there is a lot thats worthwhile here.  The always wonderful Billy Crudup finds all the darkness in the ego-driven Zimbardo, but never lets us forget hes also a human being who believed he was doing something important, even if he has momentarily lost the forest for the trees in a big way.  All the supporting players bring complexity to roles that could have felt very sketchy.  And certainly a film about an experiment that showed just how easy it is for a sense of power over others to distort the personality of almost anyone is timely and important.

I just hope that now someone can get a hold of and re-release ether the very little seen documentary of the same name, or create a new one with the actual footage.  That would be an even more powerful addition to the study of the dark sides of all of our natures.",1449446400,7,1649,4.671280276816609

7374023,4,B013W7LTL6,"This film illustrating many aspects of the original 1971 experiment is interesting enough, but it seems largely redundant. People interested in how cruel dominance develops in groups have the original footage of the experiment that they can view online. They also have Zimbardos book, The Lucifer Effect, detailing the conditions and results of the experiment. So there didn't seem to be a pressing need to go to the trouble of filming this material again.

In presenting this re-enactment, the film falls into a confusing gray area of mixed genres. Docudramas are clear dramatizations of real events. But this film is at least once removed from that category. It tends more to be a dramatization of a documentary. Or is it a documentary of a documentary? Or could it even possibly be considered a documentary of a dramatization (if one regards aspects of the original experiment to have been induced for dramatic effect)?

There is a lot of bonus material time here that could have been used to clarify some of these issues. For example, the film shows Zimbardo intervening at one point when the prisoners look as if they are either barricading themselves in their cells or else planning an escape. Zimbardo appears before the guards as himself and sharply tells them that their duty is to keep control of the prisoners. His tone is intimidatingly angry. I didn't recall him reporting that level of intervention on his part in his Lucifer book. The director commentary could have included an explanation of the difference between actual events and dramatized extrapolations. But it did no such thing.

The commentary deals strictly with how cinematic problems were solved  how lighting was adjusted and how cameras were maneuvered and focused in such small spaces. The Director says that hes specifically directing his commentary to aspiring independent film makers  and didn't want to touch on any of the psychology of the experiment. He said a mulling of the sociology/psychology of the experiment was available in enough other formats. But my feeling was - if a review of the psychological import of the experiment was viewed as being redundant - why wasn't this whole film seen as being redundant?

To the extent that Zimbardo himself was involved in this project, he showed a lot of courage in letting himself be depicted in such an unflattering light. He comes across as a very unpleasant, domineering individual  insisting that people address him as Doctor  then railing at a colleague who asks him what the independent variable is in his experiment.

Also, Zimbardos and everyones ultimate concern over how this experiment might be permanently damaging the participants is a little puzzling. There are so many situations in life in which individuals might perpetrate or be the victims of such cruel dominance games. Not only does this happen in situations that are intrinsically hierarchically organized, situations such as prisons, police/civilian encounters, and the military  but these Lord of the Flies games develop spontaneously in the workplace, in fraternities, and in schools, where bullying is a perpetual problem. English boys schools have been notorious for the cruel dominance exercised by seniors over younger boys, up to and including the most brutal physical assaults. Its likely that many of the participants in this Zimbardo experiment would either have already experienced such warped social conditions, or would experience them in the future. So its hard to understand why so many people involved in formulating this experiment, including Zimbardo himself and his girlfriend, ended up viewing this experiment as being so uniquely cruel that it had to be aborted.

All these considerations aside though, this film does provide clear, summary access to the experiment for those who don't want to read Zimbardos book or view the original washed out footage of the actual experiment.",1449187200,,3908,5.177496038034866

7374037,4,B013W7LTL6,"'The Stanford Prison Experiment' is one of the more intriguing films to release this year. In school I studied many different subjects. Psychology being one of them. One of the very first things we learned about was this very experiment. So, this film has been on my radar since its screening at the Sundance Film Festival. For those of you that don't know, The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study about how humans react to certain situations. In this particular case, being in a prison. Headed by Dr. Zimbardo and a couple of students, a make shift prison was built out of a few offices and a hallway. Then 24 students were selected to participate in this study. Twelve prisoners and twelve guards. The study was given two weeks to be carried out and paid $15 per day to it's subjects. What no one expected to happen, happened. It perfectly captured human nature, in a very scary way. It showed that, given a role and no limitations, humans can be incredibly cruel to one another. The film captures this beautifully. It shows these young men lose all sense of self with each and every moment they are there. Within one day most of the test subjects were so lost that they had forgotten each others names. Only referring to each other as the number that they were assigned. This makes 'The Stanford Prison Experiment' one of the scariest films to watch. It displays how we as humans are. Whether we like it or not. Without limits it's scary what people can and will do. Even on a scale as small as this. With every passing day these students were dehumanized more and more without even realizing it. Losing themselves entirely and falling into the role that they were assigned. Of course all this would've gone to waste without its cast. If even one of them broke character this entire film could have come crumbling down on itself. This is what struck me the moment that I began watching. It may not have any big name actors but these guys sure know what they are doing. I have seen many of them in various films but I had no idea they were this good. In many scenes their performances alone carry the film.

But not all is well here. Unfortunately this film is to fact based. Yes, it shows that these kids were completely dehumanized but it never tries to go deeper. Watching the kids grow closer to their breaking point with every passing minute was an enjoyable watch but it didn't pack any real punch. It doesn't give any reason to see it again. If you already know about this study and just want a refresher then read about it instead.

'The Stanford Prison Experiment' definitely a good watch. It makes good with the fascinating material that it so dutifully recreates. It's a film that I would recommend to anyone purely for its intense educational value. The more you know about yourselves and others, the better. Yet, if you are already familiar with the study your time is best spent elsewhere. As this film doesn't offer anything past what we already know.",1448841600,28,2971,4.582706766917293
7374038,2,B013W7LTL6,"Humans are horrible people when given power over someone else.  Psychologists are horrible people when they enjoy having power over others.  This movie just made me disgusted.  The documentary I watched on the subject years ago was far better.

7374039,5,B013W7LTL6,"This is a gripping and powerful film about how prison -- an isolated institution that houses a society where inequality is a given norm -- dehumanizes all who are part of the society:  the prisoners, the guards, the wardens, and even the researchers themselves.

Based on the actual experiment, this film is set in 1971 and captures the look and feel of gritty films of that period.  It is shot in flat colors, the actors' long hair and clothes are rough around the edges.  The music effectively underlies the story but never calls attention to itself.  The film moves swiftly through early plot mechanics:  recruiting the participants, overall instructions to them and plunges us and the characters directly into the bleak, closed world of a prison.  Within moments, the audience and the characters are plunged into a hell that - originally in the experiment was to last two weeks -- becomes overly sadistic in seemingly record time.  Soon, the subjects, both guards and prisoners insert their own realities into the experiment.  Some guards adding unneeded levels of authoritarianism, some prisoners losing sight of the fact that they can leave the experiment when they want.  The experiment itself was pulled by the head researcher after 6 days.  I had been put through a roller coaster of ugly emotions within the first 20 minutes - fear, repulsion, horror, anger.  It is the totally committed cast of really good young actors that kept me from turning this off in disgust.

One of the ways I pre-judge a movie is by how many writers are listed.  I like to think that there are still films that seek to tell an artistic truth and I believe that those truths come through best when the film is the result of one writer and one director.  This has only one screenwriter listed.  Tim Talbott, who based the screen play on the actual professor's book about the experiment, ""The Lucifer Effect"".a guy whose previous credits include 30 episodes of South Park and one other film I've never heard of.  The dialog is natural, the plot linear and easy to follow and filled with opportunities for an inventive director to give free reign to his vision.

It's to director Kyle Patrick Alvarez's credit that there are no flashy directorial episodes in the film  He knows where to place his camera, artfully aping videotaping - static repetitive long shots, direct close-ups on the actors' faces, medium shots that leaves the audience seeing only part of the horror and asking us to fill in the rest with our imaginations.  This is Alvarez's third film.  His second was the underseen C.O.G. (Children of God), based on David Sedaris's story about working on a migrant apple orchard in Washington State.  The films share a theme of exploring isolated societies built on power structures of inequality -- in C.O.G. the society is split between the Americans who own and supervise the mostly poor and immigrant workers.

This film belongs to the actors and Alvarez assembled a top-notch cast, headed by Billy Crudup (the rock star in Almost Famous) plays the head researcher is unflinching in his drive to complete an important experiment until he realizes how much humanity he, too, has lost.  Michael Angorano as the most sadistic of the guards gives a performance that is as grueling to watch as it must have been to be a prisoner under him.  It's a stunning turn for an actor who was charming in the romantic comedy ""The English Teacher"" last year.  The rest of the cast consists of television actors, familiar faces you've seen in Mad Men, The Good Wife, etc.  Given the chance to play three-dimensional characters, these guys run with it.

Highly recommended, but you know what you're getting into.  That weird world of ""prinsontainment"".  However, unlike the gaper's block that is OZ or THE BIG HOUSE, there's a point to it  given unlimited authority and power how far will we go and conversely, stripped of power how much we will assent to our own dehumanization.",1448668800,6,3958,4.836552748885587
