8177117,1,B000NDFI56,"I bought the dvd version of this movie. It doesn't show the complete movie. It only shows 25% of the movie. I hope they will re-release this movie on a better dvd that shows the complete movie, rather than only 25% of the movie.",1380931200,,228,4.204545454545454
8177118,5,B000NDFI56,"The casting is in perfect harmony with the exceptional characterization, quite a feat given the immense heterogeneity of the leading parts. Assembling Italian, English and French actors works perfectly well and adds an adequate cosmopolitan strength to the story line. Tognazzi IS Dionysos, Brochet IS innocence and Everett IS redemption. They are all magnificent.",1212710400,10,364,5.7592592592592595
8177119,1,B000NDFI56,"Movie gets a 7

Not only is the transfer from a really bad VHS tape , the movie cuts off around 61min .
