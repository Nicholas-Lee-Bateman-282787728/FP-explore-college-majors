691306,5,6303614337,"Been watching John Waters' later movies with my teenage kids, first serial mom, then polyester, crybaby last night, original hairspray tonight. They have been amazed so far.

I was a bit disappointed that this edition did not include the odorama numbers flashing in the corner of the screen.  You don't need the card for that to be funny. Also some interesting edits: at the drive in when he is visiting his friends in the back room, tab hunter mixes up
His cocaine to prepare it for free basing, but then it's implied that he has snorted it, whereas in the original hee smokes it from a glass pipe.  So this is some weird edition that wasn't what i saw in theaters or cable in the 80s.  Also, in this version Tab Hunter sings the song in the opening credits and the Debbie Harry version is nowhere to be heard.
Still glad it's available for streaming.

I'm going to let the kids ahem ""discover"" his earlier movies on their own, if they choose.  We have all agreed that we lack interest in watching divine eat dog poop.",1466294400,3,1019,4.451612903225806

A must see for every Divine Fan.
As a big Fan of John Waters, this move may not fit the taste of most normal movie watchers.
With its dry vulgar humor this would be more of a miss than a hit to those who just don't understand.
If you can handle raunch then you'll have no problem watching John's work.
The more you attempt to understand John Waters creative mind (and I am sure most never will) the more you will appreciate his direction and twisted plots.
Additional Warning:
John Waters movies can become addictive and the more you watch you'll actually feel your perverted voyeuristic side of your mind asking for more.",1406246400,,702,4.4921875
691578,3,6303614337,"POLYESTER, while representing an improvement in filmmaking technique from previous John Waters' movies, is still noticeably lacking in the narrative department. I suppose that maybe his style isn't the best fit for me, but the biggest problem with this movie is that the story is rather disjointed and lopsided. A lot of time is spent building on Divine's character's frustration and torment, but the payoff of is rather short-lived and weak. Part of the reason it's like this may have something to do with the type of movie that POLYESTER is making fun of, and the satire is pretty dead-on at times, but it succumbs to a lot of the goofiness and clichs as well. As far as acting is concerned, Divine was never really the greatest actor, but she managed to put together a decent performance here, at least more so than she did in previous John Waters films. Here, she played an entirely sympathetic character. Also starring was Tab Hunter, who was a heartthrob from the 50's and was in a bunch of movies I've never seen. Obviously, it would have helped if I'd seen or heard of him before seeing this, but I can only imagine he was poking fun at his previous image and he did look like he was having a good time onscreen. Overall, POLYESTER isn't John Waters' best movie nor his worst. It's an average story with improved production values. It's also more tame than previous Waters movies, so newbies to his style wouldn't be as put-off by this as something like PINK FLAMINGOS or FEMALE TROUBLE.",1402963200,,1495,4.666666666666667

Polyester is a perfect balance between Waters' somehow-charming
trademark gross-out sleaze (in explaining the character of Baltimore,
he calls those movies ""documentaries"") and major - picture production
values.

Packed with his regular ensemble of - uh - actors, a (closet
homosexual) 50's heartthrob, hysterical social satire, and ODORAMA,
this movie has something to purturb EVERYONE several times over.

For the mild-mannered, it's much easier to take than his early
debaucheries, while for die- hard Waters fans, it retains the hammy,
outlandish - uh - acting that helps make his movies so eccentric.",1392940800,,647,5.581632653061225

In viewing the brilliant Divine in Polyester, I am compelled to think of her ( or maybe rethink...) as one of the greatest actors ever. Really! No one was or is capable of 100% emersion in character like this goddesss of film. Yes. I am serious! Check it out.

Polyester is more mainstream but it still has the ability to shock and annoy like a toothache that won't go away.
This one-two punch of off kilter shockers is the stuff you sometimes associated with mental illness but always associate with mental depravity.

691646,4,6303614337,"If there were a movie genre called ""gay-camp"", John Waters (director of this film) is the Master of it.  For those of you not familiar with ""camp"", it's a gay term which refers to something so seedy and distasteful, that it actually becomes hilariously funny.  To some this movie may look like an amateurish piece of junk.  However, if you aren't gay, you don't know how gay people view society.  Since we have been judged so negatively by the majority for so long as being sinners, etc, we look at our society differently.  And sometimes we just have to laugh at a society which judges us so harshly just because of our sexual preference.  Finally, a word about Divine.  This actor was a true star of the genre ""gay-camp"".  He is no average drag-queen, he goes above and beyond in terms of comic timing, posture and screen presence.  So vastly under-rated and so sad we lost him at such an early point in his life.  He's a treasure.",1366329600,2,933,4.5

691709,5,6303614337,"IMHO, this has to be one of Water's best efforts.  Funny to the max.  I love  the opening credits and lmao  watching Francine preform her 'toilette' while listening to Debra Harry's excellent lyrics being crooned by Tab Hunter.  There is so much understated weirdness going on in this film  you'll miss it unless you pay very careful attention -  eg:  when Francine and Cuddles sit down for a ""big lunch"", keep an eye on the cake.

I still can't figure out what exactly Francine's mother LaRue (The Street!) has going on with Todd.  I just know she doesn't like wasting valuable shopping time.

I always thought the name ""Fishpaw"" was a creation from Water's weird mind, but I was very surprised to learn that there are people who really have that surname.  Who knew?

691713,5,6303614337,"...which is, ""could John Waters top Pink Flamingos?"". Son of a gun, he did! ""Pink Flamingos"" was a visual acid test for modern film, designed to see how far an audience could be pushed before they left the theater. That is a noble experiment in and for itself, but Waters is up to something quite different here. John is obviously learning to be a satirist here, and let's face it, the guy learns quick. Everyone is dimly aware that life is ugly; few are aware that their life is no exception. All John Waters has to do is show you, and he has a film. And really, he's not making fun of you, he loves you and your freakish failure. That's the thing people miss, I think: he believes Francine Fishpaw is a hero. To try and be nice in an America gone completely mad is not easy- a place where your son is huffing amyl, your daughter is an incurable horn-dog, your husband is a sleazeball, and your mother is out to kill you if you'll just let her in the door enough times. That might have been your life in the 80s. And if it was, this was a great big Hallmark sympathy card to you from John. He wants to say that he is sorry, and that doesn't mean he wants to apologize. He is simply sorry it had to happen that way. There's no amount of Renuzit in the universe that will wash the stink out of the air. But there's a happy ending! It may involve strangling someone with macrame and your mom being backed over by a car, but, isn't that how you really wanted the whole mess to end in your dream of dreams?",1292716800,,1502,4.164948453608248

691767,5,6303614337,"I love camp, its THE aesthetic for me. And this film is Douglas Sirk on acid. Not as purely absurd or sleazy as John Waters' early trash art, but I think thats the film's grace. Its his first tight, mainstream satire of American cultural illnesses. The first half of the film really makes art out of the depressing Hell that innocent Divine must wade through. It lets up for awhile, and the second half isn't as strong, but its not an unbalanced film or anything. Its great seeing Divine carry a film as a somewhat normal protagonist and flex his acting and amazing presence. I really commend Waters for the stylized direction and soundtrack that brings the film to life, moving away from his previous low-budget cinema verite and oddball pop selections (that we still love so much). If you enjoy 50s  melodramas, punk rock, absurdist satires and Odorama, you'll find this is one of John's best.",1211932800,,895,4.7006369426751595

691771,4,6303614337,"This two DVD set of John Waters films gives us Polyester coupled with Desperate Living. The packaging is good and the artwork reflects a good deal of thought as to how to attract viewers with a silly spoof of family and love stories in Polyester and a rather ""different"" (ahem) movie that is salvaged by great acting in Desperate Living.

In Polyester, we first watch a brief introduction by a ""scientist."" He tells us that we're about to watch a movie in odorama; and he shows moviegoers how to scratch and sniff the odorama card when the corresponding numbers light up in the corner of the screen. (Yes, you DO get an odorama card.) We then see the Fishpaw household. Francine (played by Divine) tries hard to keep her family together. That ain't easy: Francine's husband Elmer (David Samson) is fooling around with his secretary (Mink Stole); her pregnant and unwed teenage daughter is running around with junkies (look for Stiv Bators as Bo-Bo Belsinger); and her son loves women's feet so much that he routinely stomps on them and winds up in jail!

The pressure on Francine is worsened by her cruel mother. Francine's only friend is her former, mildly mentally handicapped maid Cuddles (Edith Massey) who is suddenly rich now that she's inherited a huge sum of money. Francine's world crumbles almost all together when her husband Elmer leaves her; and that's when the action speeds up even more! Francine meets Todd Tomorrow (Tab Hunter), a handsome man who's clearly interested in her. Can this be the start of a new life for Francine?

Of course, the plot can go in many different directions. Francine eventually becomes alcoholic because of her pain--will she combat her drinking problem? How far can Cuddles go to help Francine? Will Elmer really leave Francine for good? Will Francine's daughter go off with Bo-Bo? What about Francine's son? Will Todd turn out to be the right man after all for Francine? Watch the movie and find out!

The cinematography is good when the camera is filming an aerial view of the Baltimore suburb where The Fishpaws live; and the choreography works well in crowd scenes like Cuddle's debutante party. In addition, the DVD contains a director's commentary.

As for Desperate Living, the action starts in the Gravel household. Peggy Gravel has just returned from a psychiatric hospital and her husband seems to think it's going to be all right even though she's still crazy like a fox! Bosley Gravel (George Stover), Peggy's husband, wants to give her a medication injection. However, when Peggy fantasizes that Bosley is trying to kill her, their very obese maid Grizelda Brown (Jean Hill) accidentally kills Bosley by sitting on him.

They know they're in hot water for having murdered Bosley--ands Peggy and Grizelda flee in Peggy's car. After an unusual (ahem) scene in which a cop lets them get away, they know that they can only go to Mortville where murderesses are tolerated without being punished under the law.

And what a dump Mortville is! Full of trash, poor people and ugly shanties, Peggy and Grizelda don't like it. They stay, however, to avoid the law. They soon rent a room from Mole McHenry (Susan Lowe) and her female lover Muffy St. Jacques (Liz Renay). They also discover that Mortville suffers under the reign of wicked Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey), who delights in torturing people and making them walk backwards one day or be murdered on the spot.

Does Mortville work out for Peggy and Grizelda? Will Muffy or Mole make a pass at either Peggy or Grizelda? Will Queen Carlotta remain unchallenged? Watch the movie and find out!

The DVD has a commentary by John Waters; but that's really it for the DVD extras. Desperate Living isn't my kind of flick--the ""sets"" look like they were taken from a city dump-and they probably were! The acting redeems the movie to some degree.

John Waters fans will rejoice at this two DVD set. Desperate Living lets you see what John Waters did before he attempted to go mainstream; and Polyester is the first film John Waters directed when he did begin to go mainstream. I highly recommend this for fans of movies directed by John Waters; and people who like movies that are off the beaten path will love these two films as well.

691772,5,6303614337,"Polyester was probably the first John waters film geared toward a mainstream audience. It worked! Although these days Polyester is something of a cult classic; the movie was originally shown in many cinemas. Mainstream America got its first close-up look at Divine playing Francine Fishpaw; Mink Stole playing Sandra Sullivan, Francine's husband's mistress; and they saw Tab Hunter once again in a role as Todd Tomorrow, a slick guy chasing after Francine.

The action starts from a clever, creative angle: We get a brief introduction by an actor who plays a scientist. He explains to us that we're about to watch a movie in ""odorama;"" and he shows moviegoers how to scratch and sniff the odorama card when the corresponding numbers light up in the corner of the screen. (Everyone who saw the movie in theaters got an odorama card.) Although this is completely unnecssary for the plot, it somehow makes for a powerful beginning and it encourages audience involvement with the film. THEN we get introduced to the Fishpaw household. Francine, a rather big sized woman (played by Divine) tries hard to keep her family together. That ain't easy: Francine's husband Elmer (David Samson) is fooling around with his secretary (Mink Stole); her pregnant and unwed teenage daughter is running around with junkies (look for Stiv Bators as Bo-Bo Belsinger); and her son loves women's feet so much that he routinely stomps on them and winds up in jail!

Of course, the pressure on Francine is only worsened by her obnoxious, cruel mother. Francine's only friend is her former, mildly mentally handicapped maid Cuddles (Edith Massey) who is suddenly rich now that she's inherited a huge sum of money from some people she used to work for. Francine's world crumbles almost all together when her husband Elmer finally leaves her; and that's when the action speeds up even more! Francine meets Todd Tomorrow (Tab Hunter), a handsome man who's clearly interested in her. Can this be the start of a new life for Francine?

Of course, the plot can go in many different directions from here. Francine eventually becomes alcoholic because of her pain--what will she do, if anything, to combat her drinking problem? How far can Cuddles actually go to help Francine when Francine's in trouble? Will Elmer really leave Francine for good? Will Francine's daughter go off with Bo-Bo? What about Francine's son--what happens when he's in jail? Will Todd turn out to be the right man after all for Francine? Watch the movie and find out!

The cinematography is good in the beginning when the camera is looking down from an aerial view of the Baltimore suburb where The Fishpaws live; and the choreography works well in crowd scenes like Cuddle's debutante party.

The DVD extra gives us a director's commentary; and yes, you DO get an odorama card with this DVD.

Polyester remains one of John Waters's better films. The snappy dialogue and the peppy plot full of campy scenes and zesty one liners kept my attention completely. There are many funny scenes in this movie--if you like movies that are slightly off the beaten path; this one's for you!

Divine plays Francine Fishpaw, a 30'ish housewife trying HIr best to live the American Dream.  Except that HIr husband is a fat loudmouth pornographer! And HIr son is a glue sniffing foot fetishist!  And HIr daughter is a punk whore who goes out with the slimiest guy in town!  And HIr mother is a gold digging witch! And HIr dog hangs itself on the refrigerator! And HIr best friend is the deliciously ugly Edith Massey!  And HIr new lover, Todd Tomorrow, (Tab Hunter) is in cahoots with HIr mother to inherit the house and Divine's American Dream!

My favorite scene is where Divine (Francine Fishpaw) goes to her first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting!  The attendees mercilessly taunt and coach her to say the ""Magic Words""---""I'm Francine Fishpaw! And I am an alcohoooooolic!""  and they all cheer!

As if the theme and plot isn't zany enough for you, John Waters adds the spectacle of ""ODORAMA"" to the movie.  At predictable times in the film a number flashes, to have you scratch and sniff the corrosponding number on you ""odorama"" card to enjoy, for the first time, SMELLEVISION!  Smell all the delightful smells of Divine's life, from old moldy sneakers, to farts, to gasoline!

None of that changes the fact that it has not aged well, despite the fact that Tab Hunter IS kind of cute.

I do understand that the obvious charges against it -- sad, sorry, sexist, stupid, stereotyped, shoddy,  etc. -- are beside the point; the response from defenders can only be ""DUH!"" Of course that's the point. Outrage! (with a capital O!!)

But really is that enough of a point? No, I don't think so. This bizarre and tired film will deservedly sink to oblivion with (not very much more) time -- and good luck to it! I wouldn't wish watching it on my worst enemy. Life is too short to spend ANY of it on such low-budget dreck.

They are so bad they're good (hence the campiness), and inspire future generations of film makers, actors, and artists to in fact, be all that they can be in the relm of mediocrity.  Ha ha ha ...

Polyester was the now famous turning point moment for John Waters and the rest of the original DreamLander cast and crew.  It segwayed him and the rest into mainstream acceptance.  Here we see the trials and tribulations of an everyday housewife, Francine Fishpaw, trying to keep her dysfunctional family together.  Her husband is cheating while pulling in a successful living in the downtown pornographic theater.  Her daughter, LuLu, is a wild child out of control who dances ludly for the boys at lunch period and cavorts with bad boy BoBo (Stiv Bators from The Dead Boys).  Her son Dexter is a foot fetishist who criminally stomps on women's feet in between huffing their household cleaning products.  It's all falling apart after her husband leaves, her son is arrested, and LuLu goes off to a home for unwed mothers.  Further hilarity ensues when Francine meets Tod, a handsome ladies man, who seems to sweep her off her feet to take her away from all the troubles.  He is actually plotting with her shrewish mother to overthrow Francine just when things are starting to look up for her.  But Francine, ever the brave soul, triumphs in the end.

This was a hilarious story, all the characters of John Waters movies make appearances and preform at their best.  There was even an added bonus of Smelly Vision, when Scratch N' Sniff stickers had suddenly burst onto the scene.  There is a sadness about it now, not that anyone knew when it was made.  Though John Waters would go on to make his most successful commercial venture to date, Hairspray, after this movie, this would end up being the first generation DreamLander ending.  Edith Massey, the adorable Cuddles, would die shortly after due to complications from diabetes.  Cookie Mueller, though she has only a brief appearance on the faux news as a stomper victim, died of AIDS.  Stiv Bators, though far less known as an actor and more as a punk rock pioneer, died following a car accident in Paris, France.  And Divine, the star of stars of all John Waters movies, would die of a massive heart attack in his sleep a few years later.  This would mark their last hurrah.  The movies following, while they have been just as many hits as they were misses, have a distinctly different flavor to them even though the original cast continues to make appearences in them.

691863,3,6303614337,"I really like the point of view John Waters comes from when making films, the sleazy, transgressive, exploitative school of movie making.  To me though, Polyester seems to be the beginning of Waters' attempt to make more commercially acceptable films, which seems to be the antithesis of the style of flick he's making.

All of the elements are there, the foot fetishist son who breaks women's feet on angel dust highs, the go-go dancing, bo-bo dating, pregnant abortion seeking daughter, the two timing, sadistic pornographer husband, the bright as a burnt bulb ex-cleaning lady turned heiress debutant best friend, and the divine overweight alcoholic scent sniffing mother, Divine.  The plot is dementedly trashy and the dialogue is funny for the most part.

But even with all of this, there isn't much in the way of shock or sleaze.  It's hard to call a film like this subtle, but for the most part it is.  To me the film should play way over the top, but a lot of the performances are way more realistic and subdued.  A lot of this has to do with the plot, which doesn't really start moving until the last third of the movie, which plays very incidental.  Since the climax is secondary, I think the build up should be more intense, but it's really by the numbers, all weird character traits considering.  Practically all of the characters end up doing nothing more shocking than you'd see in 70's and 80's after-school specials.

All in all the film seems to be a good bridge to exploitation and sleaze cinema for those not familiar, but offers nothing new for fans of subversive independent film.  At first that seems positive, but when you consider the aim of transgression, to push the envelope to show things considered taboo and sinful, it's really a step in the wrong direction, a step toward mediocre.",1112659200,7,1812,4.757188498402556

691918,5,6303614337,"...screams Mink Stole in the opening rant of this delicious double scoop of filth and decadence. And that line sums it up perfectly: this DVD set picks up where ""Pink Flamingos/Female Trouble"" leave off.

""Desperate Living"" was the only movie in John Waters' 70's trash trilogy I had never seen (because it was never available at any local video stores) and I was unsure as to whether he could pull off another camp/trash masterpiece without his ""Elizabeth Taylor"" (I am referring, of course to that wonderfully, hilariously vulgar creature known as Divine). Ten minutes into this disc, and that answer was a definite ""yes!"".

Right from its opening moments, ""Desperate"" has the same sleazy feel as its predecessors, and the lines that come out of Mink Stole's mouth could make up an entire CD of laugh-til-you-drop sound bytes. Sheer brilliance! And the film just gets better as it goes along, when Mink and Jean Hill descend upon Mortville and Susan Lowe and Liz Renay (""I sleep in the room right next to you.....NAAA-keddd!"") enter the picture. Their flashback sequences are among the funniest moments in the movie and the ""dog food"" scene made me laugh out loud--but the ""squish"" scene at the end of the wrestling match almost made me pee my pants, it was so riotously funny!

Mary Vivian Pearce actually gives a somewhat touching performance here, as I felt sorry for Princess Coo Coo once ruthless Edith Massey as Queen Carlotta started putting her wicked plans into action. The lesbian bathroom bit was another memorable sequence (Kudos to Pat Moran for a brief but deliciously creepy turn as the ""bathroom pervert""--and to Van Smith for making her look that way). Susan Lowe as Mole delivered another gut-busting moment as she stood there proudly waving her newly-attached penis (""It never goes soft!!"") but also made me wince as Muffy finished off the last ""stitch"" making Mole scream in agony.

Aside from Princess Coo-Coo's fate at the end, the movie is a real camp classic that, like the rest of Waters' earlier work, definitely improves with repeated viewings. Watch it with friends and you will all be quoting from it for days--""Royal proclomation Number One--Kiss...my...ass!!"".

The commentary on this disc is a little disappointing because Waters' shares the time with cast member Liz Renay who spends way too much time raving about her own body and how much she loves her own boobs, but she can be forgiven because I'm sure this discussion must have brought back plenty of fun memories for her.

Waters alone does the commentary on ""Polyester"", which brings Divine back to the forefront as suburban matriach Francine Fishpaw, who's life of suburban bliss is constantly threatened by one crisis after another. Several of the Dreamlanders appear in this one, but in minor roles (Mink Stole is sadly under-used) yet Divine manges to hold it all together, and the actors playing her teen-age children deliver funny performances, with Lulu's go-go girl-gone-bad antics being a definite highlight (she even has her own theme song).

""Polyester"" is Waters' ""transition"" film--not as offensive to mainstream audiences as some of his earlier works, but still quirky enough so as not to alienate fans of those earlier works. It too, is filled with wickedly bad dialogue you'll be quoting daily (""Scrub down any interesting toilets lately?"").

Together, these two films will provide hours of fun--put these on at your next party and see who goes running for cover--you'll find out who your REAL friends are. Buy this set together with ""Pink Flamingos/Female Trouble"" and you've got hours of fun!!",1073606400,6,3603,5.023450586264657

691920,3,6303614337,"John Waters' first mainstream film is tamer compared to the likes of PINK FLAMINGOS and DESPERATE LIVING, but it's still bound to offend someone out there.
The movie stars Waters regulars Divine, Edith Massey (Both of whom mercifully remain fully clothed in this. Thank God!) & Mink Stole.
Written, Produced and Directed by Waters & Exec-Produced by Robert Shaye (who would later go on to produce the ELM STREET series) and once again set in the film maker's beloved Baltimore; POLYESTER centers around Francine Fishpaw (Divine) an unhappy 300lb housewife, whose philandering husband Elmer is a porn peddler. This makes the Fishpaw residence a perfect target for anti-porn/violence protestors (One of whom looks freakishly like Patricia Bartlett) who want Elmer to show G rated family movies (presumably) like the psychologically damaging ANNIE; because they feel X rated movies encourage sex offenders (Just like the Bible left Jim Jones & David Koresh with heads full of bad wiring- can you see the hypocrisy here? Waters certainly can).
But love comes into Francine's life in the guise of Todd Tomorrow (Tab Hunter) the owner of an adult drive-in theater also picketed by the Chastity Belt Crusaders. (NB: I just made that up).
POLYESTER is; in actuality, a suburban satire  in which Francine attempts to deal with her dysfunctional family consisting of her pothead son Dexter, who has a foot fetish which is causing him to attack women in the street and steal their shoes, to say nothing of her skanky daughter Lulu who to her mother's horror is dating Bobo, a greasy, glue-sniffing punk (played by Stiv Bators from the band Dead Boys).
Though personally I prefer Waters' underground movies to this, POLYESTER still has enough bad taste & sick humor to please his devotees and is a good introduction to his work for novices.
As with all Waters films (with the exception of HAIRSPRAY) POLYESTER will offend the heck out of prudes; which is always a good thing: People whose idea of a wild night is watching a PG movie in the dark and drinking two lite beers.
I've nearly forgotten the most important detail: This is the movie where on its original theatrical release; Waters introduced the  gimmick of a Scratch & Sniff card where when numbers 1-10 flash at the bottom of the screen the viewer would scratch the corresponding square for the aroma. Today it just looks odd with the numbers flashing onscreen. I pity the fools who actually scratched the numbers for the flatulence & glue bits. Good idea though.

I must tell you I am a long-time Waters fan, and have seen all his film from Mondo Trasho on (including The Diane Linkletter Story), but sadly, this is my least favorite of his films.  It's not necessarily bad (for a John Waters movie, that is); it just is not as funny or as happy as his other films.  Neither Divine (who was unavailable) nor David Lockery (who was dead) appeared in Desperate Living, and Waters seemed lost without them.  This movie is about a town called Mortville, where criminals are allowed to live instead of going to prison. Edith Massey, in her best film role, plays evil Queen Carlotta, who relishes in humiliating her subjects and having her sexual needs met by her ""goons"".  Mink Stole is also in top form here, thanks to the meaty role of an hysterical housewife, who, together with her maid Grizelda, murder her husband and escape to Mortville.  Another Waters regular, Mary Vivian Pearce, plays Princess Coo-Coo who, against Queen Carlotta's wishes, falls in love with the garbage collector at the Mortville nudist colony.  There are also a female-to-male sex-change operation, a bowl of dog food used as a murder weapon, and female ""glory holes"" which must be seen to be believed.
Polyester, on the other hand, is a great film.  Although Hairspray was Waters breakthrough to mainstream filmmaking, you can tell he was on his way with Polyester.  Divine is back, this time playing a victimized housewife with a philandering husband and two dilinquent children.  Her life is a complete mess until she meets suave, debonair, (and rich!) Todd Tomorrow, played by Tab Hunter, Waters' first ""real"" movie star.  However, Todd may not be what he appears to be...  In an homage to film director William Castle, who used gimmicks to promote his movies, Waters used a gimmick for Polyester: Odorama.  Theatergoers were issued Odorama Cards upon entering the theater; each card had ten numbered scratch-and-sniff patches on one side.  At certain points during the film, a number would flash on the screen, indicating that it was time to scratch and sniff.  The DVD comes with one Odorama card, which is great, unless you want to have a movie party.  However, vintage Odorama cards can usually be purchased reasonably on eBay.  Just heed the film's warning: ""Some things in life just plain stink!""
The commentary track for Polyester is Waters at his brilliant best--most of his audio commentaries are as funny or funnier than his films.  The track for Desperate Living, on the other hand, is a disappointment.  Waters shares the track with cast member Liz Renay, who has a tendancy to ramble on about things having nothing to do with the movie.  You get the impression that each was allotted a set amount of time, and Waters, who's commentary is informative and entertaining is continuously curtailed by Miss Renay's incessant chatter.  Waters' other ""shared"" commentary track is on the DVD of Hairspray.  He is joined by Ricki Lake, and their give and take works great.  For Desperate Living, Waters should have gone it alone.",1038614400,15,3309,4.899461400359066
691923,4,6303614337,"John Waters' films are outrageous, disgusting and hysterically funny!  That's the point!  Don't expect academy award winning peformances, scripts or cinematography.

They portray two very different perspectives; both are accurate!!",1037923200,4,381,6.113207547169812
691924,4,6303614337,"I found this movie very entertaining and funny. Divine was at her ultimate best. I've watched this one several times and can't help but roar laughing. Once you see one of Divine's movies you'll want to see the rest! In case  you've never heard of Divine, she's a guy  who always portrayed big fat women on the verge of virtually anything. This type of comedy is offbeat and can be on the dark side. I wouldn't  recommend it to anyone without a serious sense of humor. This one is about a porno movie theatre owner who is out cheating on his overweight wife with  his secretary. Their teenage kids are totally out of control and the mother takes to drinking when she finds out about him. 50'S  hunk Tab Hunter also is featured doing the title song which was written by Debbie Harry (Blondie) and also plays the man who comes into her life.

The film is such a wonderful stinker anyway!  It's a hoot to watch Francine Fishpaw slowly going mad.  Even the poor dog commits suicide!  At least her foot stomping son survives the mental hospital through art therapy - now he paints nothing but feet!
""Desperately Living"" contains the classy Grizelda, a huge black maid to the spoiled and wealthy Gravel family.  Well, an escape to Mortville solves all thier problems and Queen Carlotta will always feed her birdies pizza!  Oh, and what a happy ending!  Queen Carlotta gets a feast of a lifetime and so what if the whore princess foams rabies?  It a beautiful family atmosphere!  Another classic!",1028851200,3,819,4.74468085106383

This movie is a work of art-- a masterpiece-- a bevy of visual delite!!!! I laughed so hard the first time I viewed this movie. Polyester, on the other hand, is a little more dull than Desperate Living. Don't get me wrong, Polyester is good, it's just a little slow. I especially enjoyed the Odorama card that was enclosed. It made my movie-viewing experience a unique one, appealing to all of the senses. Also, the commentary by Waters is also worth viewing. This man is a god!!!

I have seen some of the grossest films ever made, Evil Dead, Me, Myself and Irene, American Pie, Scary Movie, and There's Something about Mary. I thought these were some of the grossest films ever made. Nothing on this beautiful Earth was to prepare to survive the movie Desperat Living. It is the most vulgar, disgusting, horrible, ugly, profane, and just plain nastiest film I have ever been fortunate enough to see. It is very sick, but if you can look past that you will find tuns of humor that is shockingly funny. Pink Flamingos (another John Waters movie) is said to be leagues worse, but I have yet to see it. Polyester, the other title featured in the set is very funny as well. The guy with the foot-stomping fettish cracks me up so much. Buy this set only being farewarned that the term disgustingly funny earns new meaning.",1015372800,6,934,4.598802395209581
692005,5,6303614337,"Polyester found Waters heading toward mainstream film-making, and it's his most successful attempt, as he retained his vision without selling out to studio censorship. It's also Divine's most realized performance. She is Waters'' Liz Taylor (the Virginia Woolf Liz, not the crappy Cleopatra Liz), and she works hard in this role. You'll reallly feel her torment through the laughs.
Divine was touring with her club act when DL was filmed, so she's absent. But this is Waters' most outrageous narrative. It is one of thhe funniest American films ever made, period.
Credit a great cast (the brillliant Mink Stole at her best) and a script that never quits in the laughs department. All this for under 25 bucks? Now that's what I call a bargain.",1005264000,,742,4.944
692006,5,6303614337,"Being a huge John Waters fan, I am delighted to see many of his infamous, earlier films being released on DVD. However, it's amazing to me how the passage of time changes your perspective. I used to think that ""Desperate Living"" was second only to ""Female Trouble"" as John Waters' best film and thought that ""Polyester"" was an occasionally funny, but slightly derivative suburban satire. After watching these two films again recently, my opinions have reversed.
Despite some sharp writing and some deliciously rude moments, ""Desperate Living"" is almost unbearable to watch due to the fact that 95% of the dialogue is either shouted or shrieked. In fact, the only other film I could compare it to is ""Network"", another film that's brilliantly written, but agonizing to sit through due to the shrillness of the performances. While Waters earlier films are hardly subtle, ""Desperate Living"" is particularly grating.
On the other hand, ""Polyester"" gets better and better as time goes on.  While not as visually shocking as ""Desperate Living"", ""Polyester"" has a better script, contains much funnier dialogue and has a better satirical edge.  Bratty Lulu's speech about how she can't wait to have an abortion, likening her fetus to ""a cancer ... eating away at all the fun I deserve to have"" seems even more offensive nowadays.  The film's attacks on right-to-lifers and moral majority types is especially daring, considering its Regan-era release date.
All in all, if you're a Waters fan, you've gotta buy this package, but I think I'll be watching ""Polyester"" a bit more often than ""Desperate Living"".",1001635200,7,1597,5.087786259541985
692007,4,6303614337,"POLYESTER is a comedy from director John Waters that takes a look at the dark side of suburban life. Francine Fishpaw is a woman with a dysfunctional family: her husband owns a pornography theater and is having an affair with his secretary, her daughter is pregnant and wants to have an abortion, and her son has a foot stomping fetish. Soon, Francine begins to fall in love with a man who owns an art-house movie drive-in named Todd Tomarrow. This is the first John Waters movie that I ever saw, and I've become a fan of many of his films since.
DESPERATE LIVING is a ""monstrous fairy tale"" about a mental patient named Peggy Gravel and her maid Grizelda who escape to a town populated by criminals that are ruled by the demented Queen Carlotta after they've accidentally killed Peggy's husband. There's a lot of sick, twisted, disgusting, and perverted humor throughout the film to entertain the whole family. This is one of John Waters best films next to PINK FLAMINGOS.",1001116800,,973,4.695906432748538
692008,4,6303614337,"If anybody is a John Waters fan then they know how hard it can be to find some of his movies in the best prints. I spent two years looking for a good copy of Female Trouble, and I spent months looking for Mondo Trasho and Desprate Living. And while I don't see Mondo Trasho on sale in DVD I do Desprate Living.
This DVD collection (VOL.2 in whats so far a 3 volume collection) is good. It's good because you finally get these movies in their best print, and you get subtitles. What really gives them a kick is the COMMENTARY.
1. Desprate Living - This is Waters most outragous film, maybe not in shock value but in story and plot it rises above even Female Trouble. This is a great print, though it's in MONO, but who REALLY cares. The only problem was the commentary. They had Liz Renay give a half and half commentary with WATERS. All we learned from her was that she loved HERSELF. (Well she is an actress.) I wanted to hear WATERS insite, not the past life of a nowhere star. But you take what you get when you want it.
2. Polyester - This one was great it made up for the sad tale of Liz Renay's amazingly nothing life. WE GET THE ODORAMA CARD! And the commentary is GREAT because it's 100 percent WATERS. We also get a stero and WIDESCREEN version of the film. This DVD would have been worth the 20 odd bucks alone, but then the other one would have only been worth 10, do it's a good marketing plan.
With the up coming Female Trouble/Pink Flamingos DVD I'm hoping NEW LINE sees the money that can be made and brings us MONDO TRASHO/MULTIPLE MANIACS and CRY BABY/CECIL B. DEMENTED. Who knows, even though CECIL was made under a different company I'm sure a deal can be worked out.",1000252800,3,1686,4.255451713395638

692074,5,6303614337,"""This is Odorama!"" declares Dr. Quackenshaw (Rick Breitenfeld) sounding like Dr. Strangelove at the start of John Waters' hilarious film POLYESTER.  Ignore this proclamation since it only applies to the retro  gimmick Waters used to lure people to the film during its original  theatrical run.  Scratch-and-sniff cards with various scents identified  with the numbers 1-10 were given out to members of the audience so that  they could interact with the film.  Now, unless you own one of those  souvinir cards, the numbers that flash on the bottom right corner of the  screen during the film won't do much for you, but POLYESTER is still  another wildly original film from a man who embraces the white trash  culture of America.
There are few better openers than the one Waters  created for POLYESTER.  Following the prologue, which explains the magic of  Odorama, the camera takes us on a tour of Francine Fishpaw (Divine)'s house  accompanied by a hilarious theme song sung by Tab Hunter (written by  Blondie's Chris Stein and Deborah Harry).  Up the camera goes into  Francine's room, showing her in her oversized undergarments as she trims  her nostril hair, shaves her armpits, and puts on her dress.  She goes on a  scale which reads 310 lbs and she angrily kicks the scale away.  Francine's  husband Elmer (David Samson) owns a porn theatre and outside of the  couple's house, picketers voice their disgust with a hilarious chant:  ""2,4,6,8, X-rated movies we all hate.  1,2,5,9, G-rated movies are  mighty fine.""  Francine, a devout Christian, is humiliated.  Elmer is  ecstatic:  ""All that free publicity!  I can't wait to see the 11  o'clock news!""  Their children are a son named Dexter (Ken King) who  has a strange fascination for feet and a scrapbook to prove it and a  daughter named Lu-Lu (Mary Garlington) whose raging hormones cause her to  announce:  ""I learned all about my cervix in sex education class  yesterday!""  Francine's mother makes her life even worse.  When  Francine is on the toilet, her mother walks in and says:  ""Can't you  do that later.  I don't have all day, you know.  I'm missing valuable  shopping time.""  Francine's only refuge from this living nightmare is  her former cleaning lady Cuddles (Edith Massey) who's now rich thanks to an  inheritance from another family she worked for.  Cuddles pictures herself  as the cream of the crop and loves to speak pig latin and French despite  her speech impediment due to her missing front teeth.
Thanks to her  husband who cheats on her and rubs it in her face, her dysfunctional  children, and her mother from hell, Francine's life plummets into  alcoholism until she meets the man of her dreams - Todd Tomorrow (Tab  Hunter).  She first sees Todd standing in front of his white corvette,  scratching his crotch as she looks out of the window of Cuddles' limousine.  Later, Todd and Francine ""meet cute"" at the scene of a gory car  accident.  What follows is Waters' parodying the cheesy romantic montages  of other films.  The lovers' ride in the country and frolick amongst mother  nature is set to a song by Deborah Harry and Michael Kamen sung by Bill  Murray (seriously!) sounding hilariously similar to Tab Hunter:  ""One  boy/One girl/Deeply and honestly/Our real life fantasy.""  Francine's  children are now born again artists and she declares:  ""Oh, thank you  God.  Thank you for answering my prayers.  We're a real family again.  A  normal American family.""  Soon, POLYESTER takes a huge twist that  leads to a shocking conclusion that I wouldn't dare reveal.
John Waters  has become a living legend thanks to his entertaining and creative films  that have dared to break the rules and sometimes crossed into the  mainstream.  From his ""indepedent"" films (PINK FLAMINGOS,  DESPERATE LIVING, and POLYESTER) to his recent ""Hollywood"" films  (SERIAL MOM, PECKER, and the upcoming CECIL B. DEMENTED), Waters has  joyfully embraced and satirized white trash America and his beloved  hometown of Baltimore.  In POLYESTER, he dares to tackle the abortion issue  as a protester asks:  ""Suppose Einstein's mother had an  abortion?"" and Waters provides this memorable exchange between a  mother and her son:
FRANCINE:  I'm afraid your mom's an  alcoholic.
DEXTER:  Oh, mom.  You can stop.  I got off the  the  angel dust.
And Waters also pokes fun at his own vocation of choice with  the following advertisement announced at a drive-in theatre in  POLYESTER:
""Visit our concession stand.  We feature boluga caviar,  suculent oysters, and champagne.  Take a tempting taste treat and ponder  the intellectual meaning of cinema.""
