6750750,5,B00OHFZCRK,"We don't buy many videos, but we liked this so much, we wanted a copy. It's hilarious. This is a DVD, not a Blu Ray, but it looked good to us on our 40"" plasma TV. Since this is a cartoon, I don't think it would be any better as a Blu Ray.",1420416000,4,239,3.5283018867924527

6750753,2,B00OHFZCRK,movie is not at all what you will think.  Its mostly a cheesy musical and not kid friendly in my opinion.  Don't buy it.,1419811200,5,120,3.9583333333333335
6750754,1,B00OHFZCRK,"I usually read this story to my middle school students each year, but forgot my book at home and bought this as a last minute replacement.  Big mistake. While my kids usually love the book and illustrations, this was truly cringe-worthy.  The songs were cheesy and the charm of the book was lost in the constant shift between the text and the filler that was added to make this a full length cartoon.  I never used it and chalked it up to a waste of 5.00. Definitely not a classic.  If you want to purchase the story, I would recommend the book.",1419465600,3,545,4.313725490196078

6750756,5,B00OHFZCRK,"I really enjoyed this film. It was entertaining, funny and cute. The only issue is that i don't see it coming to blu-ray. I don't deal in dvd's anymore. Dvd is a old format at 480 lines of resolution, poor quality almost like vhs...i'm into 1080 lines of resolution, HD.",1417737600,5,270,4.42

6750768,1,B00OHFZCRK,Do not be fooled by the positive reviews if you are thinking of getting this for younger children. Very crude.and disappointing.,1482537600,,128,5.142857142857143

6750773,1,B00OHFZCRK,"This is likely a movement from the PC youth crowd to promote bad behavior as ""misunderstood"" instead of what it is, bad. Parents being the blame(of course), which they shouldn't be, it is more that society telling parents how to raise kids is wrong! not being allowed to take a firm hand to truly bad kids, that is the promotion here.  and calling Murray a ""bad guy"" because he isn't willing to ""do good"" and is self centered when, in fact, he isn't really the bad guy, self centered, yes, but no half as bad as the children hes working hard to ""do good for"". No! doing for others is NOT what people need to be doing! NOT if they DON'T deserve it! Are NOT worth it!  It is the little elf and the makers of this show, not Murray, who are TRULY evil!  It isn't good Christmas cheer, though I admit when it started I loved the ""Grinch stole Christmas"" mis-rhymes that was the end of it!  it is a PC movement in the WRONG direction!  And most of the kids he delivers gifts to are not, including the girl who kills her grandpa by popping a bag behind his head causing a stroke!. Then getting a gift none-the-less.  I showed this to my mother and dad who are 72, and 75 respectively, and they wanted this movie removed from NBC television!(that won't do any good NBC has all power) but it SHOULD be removed!  It does NOT promote goodwill toward men, it does NOT prove that doing ""good"" is good. and it is NOT right in ANY way in ANY society ""new age"" or conventional classic, to expose kids nor young adult parents to this gutter trash!  It is written by loosers with mister hand puppets near their laps as they write the script, and additionally, it promotes neglectful parenting, and bad behavior in kids!  Kids,  who will grow up thinking they are ""misunderstood"" AS adults who will use this excuse to hurt others every time they ""have a bad day"".  if you value your kids and want them to do the RIGHT thing, DO NOT purchase this video and DO NOT let them watch it on NBC!!!",1480032000,,1971,4.3
6750774,5,B00OHFZCRK,What a fun story to add to the Holiday collection.,1457827200,,50,4.1

6750780,5,B00OHFZCRK,"Love this movie, it's adorable!",1453507200,,31,5.4
6750781,1,B00OHFZCRK,"This is the Christmas move equivalent of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""  -- pretty much the worst Christmas movie ever.  It is so bad that it likely becomes a cult classic for bad.  Santa is a bad guy.  There are inexplicable characters from holidays from other parts of the year that just kind of randomly show up.  The musical score is simply dreadful and the script and lyrics are even worse.  It has this narrative that bad children (including one that kills his grandfather) should get presents just like good children and Santa only takes presents to Christians but Murray takes them to people of all religions.  If you want to watch this with a group of adults get some laughs for how awful it is, do it.  Definitely not for kids.  It's twisted.",1450915200,2,747,4.514925373134329
6750782,5,B00OHFZCRK,"Absolutely hilarious.  Exceptionally clever, with multiple pop-culture tid bits for all us TV nerds.",1449273600,,100,6.142857142857143

6750786,5,B00OHFZCRK,"As with all the best cartoons, there is plenty for the kids, and humor that will pass over the kids' heads and amuse the adults.
  Destined to become a classic!",1427068800,,160,4.3

6750788,5,B00OHFZCRK,This is a new favorite for Christmas! This appealed to my quirky sense of humor. Kind of off-the-wall but very entertaining and even a little poignant for those that want sappy at Christmas.,1424649600,,190,4.787878787878788

6750793,5,B00OHFZCRK,"This film was broadcast twice at Christmas, and I watched it both times, which I seldom do with any show spaced closely together. That's when I knew I had to own it. The rhyming dialog is clever and never cloying- it made me laugh and smile all the way through. Musical numbers are choreographed with humor and are catchy, the animation is detailed and easy on the eyes. Acting is good throughout. While some may consider a few scenes silly, if you are open and ready to let yourself go, and don't take yourself too seriously, you'll most likely enjoy this film. Be prepared to poke a little fun at a slightly foolish Santa and a self satisfied policeman. The idea that the Christmas spirit is for everyone and can offer redemption has never been so humorously told.",1422835200,2,766,4.557971014492754
6750794,4,B00OHFZCRK,Good cartoon story.  It can be appreciated by children and adults.  The puns are for the adults.,1422835200,,96,4.588235294117647
