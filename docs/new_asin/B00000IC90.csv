7910011,5,B00000IC90,"This is a wonderful old British TV series but buy the TWO volume set for a better deal:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avengers-67-Set-1-Vols-1-2/dp/B00000IC8Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avengers '67 - Set 1, Vols. 1 & 2</a>

(Please note that the title refers to this volume as ""1966,"" which is wrong -- just look at the illustration and you will see that it's part of the '67 series!)

You can check out my full review of each episode there as well as my other more general comments about the series.

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211673600,,791,5.15625
7910012,5,B00000IC90,"If you fondly remember that great British import that we watched on TV way back in the 60s then you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John might say to Emma, ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Emma are back and are here to stay. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good, excellent in fact. Still can't get that great theme out of my head.",996969600,3,593,4.303571428571429
