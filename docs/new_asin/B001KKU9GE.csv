8315172,1,B001KKU9GE,"I couldn't make it more than 10 minutes through this movie, ""10 Dead Men."" It's about a man [Brendan Carr] looking for revenge on the two men that almost killed him. The video is shot with a CAMCORDER - NOT Panavision or similar cameras! The film quality is super cheap, and the soundtrack is awful and the actors are college rejects. I couldn't believe it made it on DVD. Like I said, I wasted 10 minutes of my life on this film. RUN, DON'T WALK from this. You will be greatly appreciated.",1362182400,,490,4.336956521739131
