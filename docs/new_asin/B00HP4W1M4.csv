6194596,4,B00HP4W1M4,"Had zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised as to how well done this film was.  The practical effects were fantastic and cleverly done.  I'm a big fan of the Horror genre and it was refreshing to see this as a solid entry.  The lead actress did an awesome job, not to mention she is on screen for almost the entire length of the film which is no small feat!  She is also extremely likable and comes across as a character that you can relate to; someone you might know.  Kudos to the whole crew for working on a seemingly super low budget and giving us something creepy and entertaining.  I will be checking out the Director's first feature, Scare Zone this weekend.",1392940800,,672,4.467213114754099
6194597,5,B00HP4W1M4,Better than expected. great graphics and worth the viewing. would def watch again maybe again too go and watch this movie,1392768000,,121,4.809523809523809
6194598,1,B00HP4W1M4,First 4 and 5 Reviews Def. Misleading. The cast and crew must have written these or they paid someone. Really I am a huge Horror fan and have sat through some rough stuff but 20 minutes of a fortune teller who's acting is just horrible was too much LOL. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,1392681600,16,278,4.166666666666667
6194599,5,B00HP4W1M4,The spooky scary type not the slice and dice type. Very suspenseful and it kept my attention. I wish there were more like this.,1392422400,,127,4.333333333333333
6194600,4,B00HP4W1M4,"The acting was good, especially the lead role (Which is so important.) The story line flowed well which is also vital. The theme was believable, which too many directors and writers overlook. The filming for this level of budget was superb. The surprise spooks were well engineered... My only wish was that what spooked was more terrifying looking. Smoky monsters, no matter what they're throwing around or tossing around or breaking, etc... just doesn't cut it for me. But, overall, this film gets a Bravo from me. It's hard to tell a story and get everything right about the genre it's cast in correct and this film had a very decent flow and some cool moments.
I'm and arm chair critic, so please take into consideration that though I've worked on film for over 25 years in the sound department and am an avid fan of horror flicks, I am still an amateur critic, that is to say, since I've never made a film from top to bottom, I only have some qualifications to critique, not all of them.
Thank you for reading my review,

6194601,4,B00HP4W1M4,"The director  has done well  considering this to be a low budget movie. Like the character development, but the dialogue/context  was repetitious. The choice of lead actress is good. rented this movie over a sunday afternoon, time spent worth... Thanks.",1391904000,16,253,5.275
6194602,4,B00HP4W1M4,"I took a chance on this film mainly because the trailer looked professionally done.  It wasn't just the trailer, the whole movie was professional.  The lead actress is good, holds her own in the title role.  Her quirky BFF Maya is quite a character; full of energy and enthusiasm, I liked her.  Their bond seemed genuine, like they could be BFF's in real life.  The story was believable and held my interest until the end - I believe I read this was based on actual events(?).

I really really liked this movie.  Granted, it isn't an ""action-packed"" film and you won't see gore and blood - it's a  supernatural, paranormal flick and I think you should take a chance on it - I was very pleased I rented it.",1391472000,34,705,4.410852713178294

6194604,3,B00HP4W1M4,"I didn't know if I should give this two or three stars. It was ok. I felt this could've been so much better. The main character was getting on my nerves. I know in horror movies people need to be dumb or else you wouldn't have much of a movie. But this lady was too much. How much more weird things happening around your house do you really need before you either: Tell your friend to come over, hop on the nope train and go to her house ( this would be my choice) or at the very least when she's trying to give you advice don't hang up on her and listen, because she knows what she is talking about.",1475020800,,600,3.9669421487603307

In some ways it reminded me of something youd see on a show like say Tales From the Crypt or The Twilight Zone .There were a few times I was at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen to her next.

6194658,3,B00HP4W1M4,"Acting was okay, not great but not horrible. The storyline felt quirky and interesting, albeit somewhat predictable. It held my interest and I was glad I got it to watch - until the end. The ending was so predictable, clich and formulaic that it totally destroyed the rest of the movie. Hence, the three star rating. Actually the boring ending didn't completely negate the beginning hour and fifteen minutes of the movie, but came close. Here's an idea. If you want a fairly interesting movie to watch for an hour or so, watch this - but don't bother with the last fifteen minutes, make up your own ending and you'll likely be happier and more scared by that!

I should imagine younger horror fans would like it more, but I guess I watch too many mysteries and sci-fi films, and generally love only those that have a plot twist that I couldn't predict as I was watching the movie.

Happy Valentine's Day! Watched this to celebrate. Joking. Not a bad movie. Good acting by the main actor. Some of the other actors just need more experience. The real estate agent, Lee, was hard to watch and I almost shut down the movie because of her acting. Interesting plot though not a new one. Some nice tense moments  that keep your interest. Quality of the film was good. Okay, one irritating thing about the writing...hetero femmes don't usually say stuff like ""Love you"", ""Love you more"" to one another. Also, that was cribbed from another flick.

And it does! I really liked this film, and was especially impressed given that it was an independent film. Not every viewer is going to like a ""slow burn"" where the suspense and tension escalates over time for one big finale. That's okay; if you prefer to see action throughout the film then this may not be for you. But if you don't mind a gradual building of the tension, such as what you might find in this film or The House of the Devil, then you'll really appreciate it. It's a little ragged at the edges--some of the dialogue between Samantha and her friend is a little clich and the gravelly spirit voice you hear from time to time made my eyes roll--but other than that, this is definitely worth watching.

6194879,3,B00HP4W1M4,"This movie was obviously low budget, with only a few no-name actors, and the special effects were simple.
There was no blood or gore, so I would call it a thriller (not a horror movie) because it was suspenseful but not scary.
I enjoyed it and it held my attention.
It was slow moving, but that added to the suspense.
I really felt for Samantha's loss over losing her husband, and being lonely in a big house, and hating her job.
I loved the ending.

The one thing that really annoyed me about this movie was that the friend, Maya, asked Samantha about a dozen times if she should come over. Samantha kept saying no, but instead, she kept calling her and freaking out over the phone.  If I were Maya, only half an hour away in a car, I would have just gone over there, especially as it started getting later in the evening.

Samantha said that she had a long day of work the next day, but then, at the end, she finally told Maya to come over and that they could go dancing, and by this time, it was after midnight.  Samantha took sleeping pills, had taken off her make-up, was wearing sweatpants, and had been freaking out all night, and so it did not look like she was in any condition to go dancing, and certainly not to have alcoholic drinks after taking pills.

Maya was a good friend to her, lending her spiritual items, talking to her all night, being supportive and upbeat and understanding, and offering to come over.",1439164800,,1425,4.362264150943396

Lots of basic haunted house stuff--mainly where any sane person would leave the house, yet they don't, thereby fostering enmity on the part of the viewer toward the stupid person who doesn't leave.

Why the visitant attaches itself to the real estate lady in the first place is never explained. It's things like--things that give a good horror movie it's strong and necessary internal rules that are needed for it to be good. This movie just kind of throws things together and then inflicts the viewer with implausible things--like the friend who just happens to be all up on ghosts.

6194956,3,B00HP4W1M4,"I liked this movie. I like when I like an unexpectedly pretty good B movie. The theory of paranormal attachment; actually, I'm a believer, not a theorist, plays well here. And a woman who's trying to find an acting gig, working as a carnival fortune teller, who doesn't believe in the supernatural; that's clever.  Her best friend skyper, a bubbly true believer. I'm a fairly knowledgeable para/super/supra natural kind of gal; this skype buddy was rattling off category numbers and evil, neutral, good quantities like a Dungeons and Dragons nerd expert. Category 3, like a Tornado or Earthquake. That's clever.

There's one scene, which is the catalyst for this faking it fortune teller, where she is visited by a most distraught, desperate patroness. She is being terrorized by something that appears to be demonic; and this never-have-I-seen-you-before actress... impressive in her exhausted, terrified, desperation.

In fact, just recalling that scene, I've completely forgotten how the movie ended.

More likely, just too lazy to finish a job, too bad, this could have been a good one.

The entity doesn't waste anytime making its presence known to our lead and the movie provides its fair share of creepy or scary moments. If anything, there's a little too much of it. We know it's in the house, we know it's messing with her, we don't need to see a CGI spectral shadow stalking her, or a demonic image flash up on a television screen full of static. That's lame in my book. Seeing a ceiling lamp start to swing gently, or a light slowly being lit up as the character walks by unaware is enough to let us know it's following her. No F-bombs are dropped, no sex or nudity, practically nonexistent gore, so as PG-13 horror movies go, The Visitant is well worth your time if you're looking for some tame scares.",1420329600,2,834,4.422077922077922

There are gaps of logic, but what movie doesn't; that kind of movie is a rare breed and usually very high budget directed and conceived by detail  obsessed individuals that demand 40+ takes of a minor scene just to get the right expression out of an actor.

Overall this is a satisfying delve into spiritualism with some amusing twists.

Samantha comes home, plays with her bird, gets the mail, walks inside, closes the blinds, walks to the bathroom and takes off her fortune teller make up and contacts which changes her looks in a really big way.  When she picks up the phone and talks to her friend, she mentions how everyone in the fortune teller room has a secret.  Samantha insists she isn't conning anyone but... she is!

She hears the piano playing by itself but it's just a gerbil walking across the keys.  Her friend brings up a guy (her boyfriend named Stephen) and how his art belongs in a museum.  The movie doesn't say what happened to the guy but we assume he died.  Then we see Stephen's art work while creepy music plays.

We now see Samantha coming home late at night from a jog to the sound of loud music filling her house.  She runs inside, turns the TV and music off.  At first I thought this segment was a nightmare!  She talks to her friend again on the phone.  Samantha thinks it's a power surge that caused the chaos and loud music but her friend thinks it's telekinesis.  Samantha fiddles with a knob and hears a weird ghost sound which scares her.  Then she hears feet pounding upstairs.  She calls her friend back and heads upstairs.  The feet walking is actually the sound of the curtains flapping in the wind.  Samantha gets a shower and the letter S appears on her glass shower door.  She exits the bathroom and sees her antiques rattle.

While eating food and watching TV on the couch she sees shadows moving in the corner of her eye.  While drinking milk she hears a weird demonic scream and spits it out.  She unplugs the TV and, while it's easy to miss, those who pay close attention can see an image of a ghost in the TV while the static fades.  Cool effect there!  Samantha tries to call her friend but she doesn't pick up.  Instead she calls her shrink and he thinks she's having another one of her anxiety disorder attacks.  He thinks she's just having a memory which triggers the return of her symptoms.  She mentions how her boyfriend died a year ago today.  The shrink mentions the memory might be painful but it's just another day on the calendar.  He recommends getting rid of her boyfriend's art work so she can let him go.

As the conversation ends the shrink disappears as ghostly demons take over the computer monitor.  Samantha takes her medication and off to bed she goes.  She falls asleep while laying in bed reading a book only to wake up hearing banging coming from behind her bedroom door.  Well at first she wakes up in a dream and sees a strange soldier figure looking at her.  She screams ""Go away!"" and the door flies open.  Upon waking up (for real) and opening her bedroom door she sees a small figurine of the alien figure lying on the floor.  Samantha talks to her friend on the computer monitor.  She mentions she was talking to her shrink and that she was hearing things.

Her friend insists something spiritual is in the house and haunting the woman.  Her friend says ghosts don't care if people believe in them or not, and that she had a ghost in her house.  The two sort of joke it off. They have a lengthy discussion about ghosts.  While researching what a visitant is online, suddenly this horrible death metal noise screams through the computer speakers.  Oh man that music's bad!  It would scare me too.  Samantha walks around the house taking picture of her mirrors.  She slowly walks into her boyfriend's art room.  Some freaky art work indeed, including a giant centipede demon in black and white, and a Yoda-looking puppet.  She looks over the footage of the pictures she took, and while talking to her friend on the phone, her friend recommends looking for anything suspicious.

Suddenly the power goes off.  Samantha walks around in the dark looking for the circuit breakers.  She finds it and turns the power back on, but when she turns around the washing machine is filled with inflatable monsters.  When Samantha calls her friend, her friend says she tried calling Samantha for an hour.  Samantha says the inflatable monster in the washing machine was just upstairs and it doesn't make sense how it got down here.  Samantha chalks it up to the thing falling in the laundry basket.  She mentions the woman she had to deal with while working her phony fortune teller job, and thinks the spirit was released from the woman and attached itself to her.

Her friend recommends cleansing her house with smoked sage and walking around each room talking to the spirits.  Samantha finds a bowl to put the sage in.  Before this a glass falls in her hands when she opens the cabinet door.  That would freak me out but not Samantha apparently!  While walking around the house she says ""I need you to go away.  You're not wanted here"".  The TV comes on the moment Samantha leaves the room and we again see a monster in the static.  As she leaves the upstairs hallway her boyfriend's picture frame cracks.  Samantha screams ""Go away!"" when she hears pounding in the art room.  She panics when the smoked sage sets the smoke detector off.  She finds newspaper clippings about her boyfriend, and notices the name of the woman she had to deal with during the fortune teller incident is shown in the paper.  The lady handed Samantha a business card while getting her fortune read, and now Samantha's about to burn it.

Samantha suspects the woman killed her boyfriend in a hit and run incident and calls the woman and asks if she was drunk when she killed him. It's not a coincidence the woman visited a fortune teller a year after the death of Samantha's boyfriend.  The woman gets upset and says Samantha's boyfriend ran into a tree.  She witnessed him drive towards the tree like he was aiming for it.  The woman got out of her car and prayed for Samantha's boyfriend, but she felt the presence of a demon.  This demon followed the woman home and haunted her.  The woman insists Samantha's boyfriend is with her in the house.

Samantha lights a candle and tries to contact her boyfriend.  She apologizes for burning his sage and banishing him.  She begs him to come back.  She wants him to move the mask she placed on the floor.  He does.  She asks him to move the toy.  He does that as well.  Samantha panics and calls her friend.  She tells her friend the spirit is her boyfriend.  She doesn't believe Samantha and says she needs to be sure.  It might be another spirit- a darker one, according to Samantha's friend.

Samantha talks to her boyfriend- ""If you truly are Steven I open my heart to you.  I'm ready for you.  Let's connect"".  Just then the candle blows out and a harsh wind fills up the room.  Drawers bang open and drawings magically appear in the book.  Samantha says she doesn't understand what to do and insists ""I'm yours"".  The scrabble letters move around the floor and spell ""Steven"".  When the letters spell ""Steven"" instead of ""Stephen"" Samantha screams ""Hey, you're not Stephen!"" Then the spirit bangs the door into her ankle as she tries to run away.  When the door opens we see a SUPER scary demon running towards Samantha.  That's definitely a frightening scare there!  When the friend arrives she sees Samantha lying on the floor.  She holds her hand as the move ends.

A pretty good suspense.  The acting's surprisingly solid and the story's decent but there's not really a whole lot going on.  Nothing truly remarkable about this movie.  Perhaps the whole fortune teller part in the beginning was probably the movie's biggest mistake given how tacky it was done and how it made the movie look like a poor horror film, but I guess the scene was necessary to get the story rolling.  I think the movie relies too much on the constant phone conversations between Samantha and her friend.  All these phone calls reduce the suspense factor so the movie ends up looking like young girls freaking out by simple bumps in the night even though there really is a demon in the house.

Otherwise I enjoy the Visitant and would recommend it.  The story gets a lot better in the second half if you're willing to stick with it.  The demon activity is used sparsely which I like, as is the tease that this is the boyfriend of Samantha.  Samantha insists it's her boyfriend coming back to visit her, whereas her friend thinks it's a demon.  Perhaps it's odd that Samantha doesn't seem as torn up about the anniversary of her boyfriend's death as she should be, and the subject of her mental issues isn't brought to our attention very much either.  I still enjoy the film.",1498262400,,9620,4.568248388986526
