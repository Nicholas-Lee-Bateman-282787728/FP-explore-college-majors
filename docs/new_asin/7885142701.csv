However, I will be looking for english copies in stores. Good preview of what I am going to purchase in english.",1314489600,14,283,4.461538461538462
1124087,4,7885142701,"These stories are historical and wholesome.  Great messages and morals are given in these movies. The fight scenes were built up and triumphant, I could not just sit there and watch them, I had to stand and cheer him on!!",1313625600,5,221,4.525

1124089,1,7885142701,"in regards to this collection, ip man 3 is actually known as ""the legend is born: ip man"".

it is a prequel to the original ip man movies with donnie yen in them.
so it is not ip man 3, its not released by the same studio or follow exactly the same story line and the first 2 movies.
these are dodge asian rip offs. make sure you buy the proper ones seperatly",1312675200,11,359,3.9178082191780823
1124090,5,7885142701,"After reading the other reviews and hearing that Ipman 3 wasn't worth purchasing, I was hesitant to purchase the set, but I did and my husband really likes all of the movies.  I would recommend this if you like kung fu movies.  My husband made me watch the 1st movie and has lent them out to our brother in law already and keeps talking about them to family and friends.",1311552000,6,370,4.271428571428571

1124092,1,7885142701,"The DVDs I got weren't part of any particular set, and they look like bootlegs to me. It was three DVDs, packaged individually. Artwork was fuzzy and two of the three discs were loose and off their hub. Luckily despite the scratches they all played. Picture wasn't that great on two of the three. Now looking at seller's listings, it seems that not all products are the same. There are a couple sellers selling what appears to be bonafide sets that are packaged together and they claim are official releases. I might take a chance and reorder. IP MAN is probably one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and I want a really good version. Also, if you flip to page 2 or 3 of ""IP MAN"" search results, there is another 3 disc set that looks a bit more legit. I think I might email one of the sellers for that product.",1311120000,39,818,4.25
1124093,5,7885142701,"This DVD collection contains all three IP MAN films. Part 1 & 2 star Donnie Yen as the title character. Part 3 a.k.a ""Legend is Born"" is a prequel and stars Dennis To, a real life martial arts champion. All movies are fantastic. The Donnie Yen films are crowd pleasing and are absolutely terrific. Part 3 isn't a bad film, but is more for completists. These DVDs are really high quality. I did a more professional review for another web site, and the technical specs of all three discs stand out for their high bitrate transfers and Dolby/dts 6.1 soundtracks. English subtitles are quality on all 3 discs. Packaging is efficient in a single high quality 3 disc capacity case. A terrific buy.",1309996800,19,691,4.626016260162602

1124899,5,7885142701,These are some of donnies best though the 3rd didn't have Donnie it was still a good movie oh and its in two languages and that's why its not in English. I am referring to the 3rd ip man,1380153600,,186,3.7948717948717947
1124900,5,7885142701,"Interesting, none of these would play on my new DVD player, but they played just fine on my old one. Not sure why. Perhaps region code? Anyway, they are good to watch, especially if you want more background to compliment the 2012 or 2013 Ip Man movies out now. There's the original Ip Man, a DVD of his earlier life (called Ip Man Zero) and Ip Man 2. All three are much better than the 2012 Ip Man - The Final Fight (not in this set). If you like studying this form of Martial Arts, and enjoy watching really good filming of full body action (not that hollywood closeups of body parts making contact with jumpy camera effects) then you'll enjoy these DVDs.

One more thing, they are overdubbed in English. The translation is a bit strange, so I recommend having the English subtitles on as well and make your best guess as to what was actually going on by listening and reading the English translations simultaneously.",1379894400,,918,4.497005988023952

1124902,5,7885142701,Great set!  You have to go into menu and turn off them speaking English but after that its a good DVD set. It's a bit much with subtitles and them dubing it in English. You can change it to one or the other in the menu area.,1377993600,,224,3.765957446808511

1125203,4,7885142701,It was interesting to learn about the master of all masters. this film is a great movie. the history of china was depicted in this film to some extend. I enjoyed these movies and will be watching it over and over again.,1377216000,,219,4.238095238095238

1125205,5,7885142701,"Great movie.. It shows a side to the Sino-Japanese war that most people don't get to see, the hardship and the cruelty of the Japanese occupation.

1125210,4,7885142701,"Fantastic, a? i couldn't believe i found this at such a low price, such is the wonder of Amazon. however, im very picky, as are most lovers of a certain genre or film. The only reason i didn't rate this set a full 5 stars is that the Ip Man 2 in this collection erroneously has a ""cantonese"" language option, which is the beautiful original language of this film. it is actually Mandarin. So, lovers of the original form will notice right away it isn't right. i never watch modern kung fu films in english dub. its terrible and much of the feeling is lost. But i know that to many westerners, this is trivial. if youve got the money and are die hard fans of these, buy them separately. If the language options aren't important, then this is a real bargain! Im still happy with my purchase.",1361232000,,789,4.337837837837838
