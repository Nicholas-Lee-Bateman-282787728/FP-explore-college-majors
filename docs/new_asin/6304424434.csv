Maurice Sendeck is just an amazing illustrator, he turned Little Bear into a show after the books, and hits a grand slam! The shows brings back a lot of memories, too! Two thumbs ups! I highly recommand it!",1431043200,,282,4.775510204081633

7873484,5,6304424434,Both of my children have watched Little Bear since they were toddlers and I enjoy them too!  The stories show family values.  The animals are so cute and lovable and the music is very relaxing.  Little Bear is an excellent addition for anyone with kids - of any age!,1222214400,,266,4.387755102040816
7873485,4,6304424434,"the original ""little bear"" stories are marvelous. This video preserves the sense of warmth and love that distinguish the books. This is a family that does things together. The Little  Bear character embodies many of the traits of a typical toddler/preschooler. Mama and  Papa Bear provide structure for a little bear discovering a wonderful and sometimes complicated world out there.
 Unfortunately, the tape is of very poor quality. I exchanged it once, but the new tape is just as bad. Luckily, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. My 3 year old daughter really loves these stories. She can identify with many of the concerns and delights that Little Bear experiences.",976060800,9,667,5.045454545454546
7873486,5,6304424434,"I discovered these wonderful stories when my daughter was born.  She is now 18 months old, and eagerly looks forward to watching Little Bear while I am making dinner (it's the only thing that keeps her out from under my  feet!).
The stories are endearing, the pacing is slower than most  ""cartoons"", the stories have morals and they encourage children  to explore their world while being careful, kind and loving.
I love  watching these videos with my daughter, and I have purchased all the books  so that when she is learning to read, she can snuggle up with these high  quality tales.
I highly recommend these videos to anyone that thinks that  ""tv cartoons"" are too violent and action packed, and want their  children to become loving, caring people.",912124800,3,753,4.775193798449612
