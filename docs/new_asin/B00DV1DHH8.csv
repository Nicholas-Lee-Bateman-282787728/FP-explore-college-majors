8598130,5,B00DV1DHH8,"""THE POKER HOUSE"" ALSO KNOWN AS ""BEHIND CLOSED DOORS"" IS A VERY WELL WRITTEN AND WELL ACTED REALISTIC STORY ABOUT THE LIFE THAT CHILDREN SO OFTEN FACE WHEN ONE OR BOTH PARENTS DRINKS TOO MUCH ALCOHOL OR COMSUMES OTHER DRUGS. ALSO IT TOUCHES ON THE SAD REALITY THAT SOME CHURCH LEADERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AT HOME THAN WHAT THEY PORTRAY AT CHURCH. OUR STORY FOCUSES ON 3 WONDERFUL LITTLE GIRLS AGES 10-14 THAT LIVE WITH THEIR USUALLY DRUNK MOTHER IN A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.  AN OLD FAMILY FILM SHOWS HOW THE DRUNK FATHER BEAT HIS WIFE AND THE GIRLS, AND HOW HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH TO BE ANY PART OF THEIR LIFE. HE BASICALLY ABANDONED THEM AFTER THE SEPARATION. THE MOM'S DRUNKENNESS IS DESTRUCTIVE TO HER DAUGHTERS SELF ESTEEM BECAUSE OF FREQUENT VERBAL CRITICISM, THE TYPE THAT ACCENTUATES THE NEGATIVE AND ELIMINATES THE POSITIVE. THE MOM DIDN'T GIVE THE LOVE THAT DAUGHTERS NEED. RATHER THAN BEING ANY SUPPORT TO HER DAUGHTER, WHO WAS THE BEST BASKETBALL PLAYER ON HER SCHOOLS TEAM, SHE WAS READY TO TEACH HER 14 YEAR OLD, AGNES, HOW TO HAVE SEX WITH ANY OF THE MANY MEN THAT PARTIED REGULARLY AT THE GIRLS HOME.  AGNES, PLAYED TO GIRLISH PERFECTION BY A GORGEOUS 19 YEAR OLD NAMED JENNIFER LAWRENCE, WAS SEDUCED AND RAPED BY AN INTOXICATED BOYFRIEND OF HER MOTHER'S. AGNES RUSHED INTO THE BATHROOM TO CLEAN OUT HER BLEEDING VAGINA BECAUSE HER VIRGINITY HAD JUST BEEN PAINFULLY RIPPED AWAY. WHEN HER MOM CAME IN, AGNES, TRIED TO GET HELP AND LOVE, CRYING AND REACHING FOR A HUG, BUT THE MOM DIDN'T SHOW ANY LOVE AND STARTED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL OF THE TIME THAT SHE WASTED READING TO AGNES WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, PLAYED BY BEAUTIFUL CHLOE GRACE MORETZ, APPARENTLY ESCAPED BY SPENDING AS MUCH TIME AS SHE COULD AT FRIENDS HOUSES. THE MIDDLE GIRL DELIVERED NEWSPAPERS, BEFRIENDED SOME HOMELESS PERSONS, TELLING THEM HOW SHE MAY GET ADOPTED, AND APPARENTLY FANTASIZED ABOUT NEW IDEAL PEOPLE IN HER LIFE. ALL 3 GIRLS DEVELOPED OUTSIDE INTERESTS AND FRIENDS, THAT ALTHOUGH WERE FAR FROM IDEAL, NEVERTHELESS WERE HELPFUL BECAUSE OF THE HORRID SITUATION AT THEIR HOME. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE LORD PUTS A GREATER HEDGE OF PROTECTION AROUND YOUTHS, BUT SOMETIMES HE REMOVES PEOPLE FROM THIS WORLD YOUNG. PLEASE READ WISDOM OF SOLOMON 4:7-19.
WHO HASN'T SEEN OR HEARD OF THE HORRID VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE THAT COMES FROM DRUGS OR TOO MUCH ALCOHOL? A PERSON THAT DOESN'T ENCOUNTER THESE TYPES OF ABUSES IS VERY BLESSED. THE FOLLOWING FORMS OF VERBAL ABUSE ARE FAR TO COMMON: MACHINE GUN (MGVA), MACHINE GUN VERBAL CRITICISM (MGVC), AND GUN CRITISM (GC).  MGVA IS RAPID FIRE ABUSE WITH LITTLE CHANCE TO RESPOND. MGVC IS RAPID FIRE DESTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS WITH LITTLE CHANCE TO RESPOND, AND GC IS ONE OR MORE CRITISMS SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT YOUR TIME WITH A PERSON OR PERSONS. THE MOM IN THIS MOVIE USED GC AND MGVC, WHICH I HAVE FOUND TO BE INSIDIOUS, BECAUSE THOSE THAT DO THIS, IGNORE THE 95% OR MORE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT YOU DO, ACCENTUATING THE NEGATIVE AND ELIMINATING THE POSITIVE. WORSE YET, THEY ALMOST NEVER REMEMBER THE HORRID WAY THAT THEY BEHAVED, SO APOLOGY IS UNHEARD OF FROM THESE ABUSERS. IN MY LIFE, I BELIEVE THAT ABUSIVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T REMEMBER IT ARE TEMPORARILY POSSESSED, THAT A DEMON AND WITCH COMBINATION HAS BEEN RUINING OUR FAMILY IN THIS WAY FOR ALL OF THE NEARLY 100 YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PILLARS OF THE BEAUTIFUL SAMISH ISLAND COMMMUNITY. VERBAL ABUSE/CRITICISM HAS LEAD MANY TO BE DEPRESSED OR EVEN COMMIT SUICIDE, BUT MY LOVE FOR GOD AND MAN IS UNENDING, NO MATTER WHAT EVIL IS DONE TO ME.  HAVING NEVER CHOSEN TO HURT ANYONE IN  MY ADULT LIFE, TO ALMOST ALWAYS TREAT EVERYONE LIKE I WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED (LUKE 6:31), TO OBSERVE EVERYONES RIGHTS AND PRESUME EVERYONES INNOCENCE, HAS ALLOWED ME TO REMAIN JOYFUL IN THE LORD DURING THE OPPRESSION CAUSED BY MY FAMILY'S PHANTOM MENACE.  I HAVE NEVER CHOSEN TO BUY ALCOHOL OR NONPRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR MYSELF, OR TO ACCEPT THEM AS GIFTS MY ENTIRE LIFE!  UNFORTUNATLY, MY WITCH HAS ""SPIKED MY APPLES"" AND DONE WHAT HE/SHE CAN TO DESTROY MY FRIENDSHIPS ALL THROUGH MY ""YELLOW BRICK ROAD"" OF LIFE.  MY RESPONSE TO THE EVILS OF THIS WORLD IS TO DO GOOD AND GOOD ALONE!
THE END OF THE MOVIE SHOWS THAT THE GIRLS FINEST DEFENSE IS THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER COUPLED WITH THEIR HEALTHY RESPONSE TO SEPARATE FROM THEIR DRUNK MOM AND HER FRIENDS. SEPARATING ONESELF FROM ABUSERS IS A NECESSARY TOUGH LOVE RESPONSE. THE MOVIE ENDS IN AN UPBEAT WAY AND THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE GIRLS WILL SUCCEED IN SAVING THEMSELVES FROM THE HORRORS OF REMAINING THERE. TRAGICALLY, ONE OF EVERY FOUR GIRLS WILL BE SERIOUSLY SEXUALLY MOLESTED OR RAPED BEFORE THEY GROW UP. GIRLS IN A HOME LIKE THE POKER HOUSE ARE EXTREMELY LIKELY TO BE RAPED MULTIPLE TIMES.  IF YOU CAN, PLEASE HELP CHILDREN AND THE PARENT IN SUCH HORRID SITUATIONS. PERHAPS YOU CAN TAKE THE DRINKER TO A TREATMENT PROGRAM AND AA MEETINGS, AND THE KIDS TO YOUR LOVING HOME, CHURCH YOUTH GROUPS, AND ALANON FOR TEENS.  ABSOLUTELY DO NOT ABUSE THE DRINKER OR DRUGGER IN ANY WAY.  WHEN YOU DO THIS, YOU BECOME AS BAD OR WORSE THAN THE ABUSER THEMSELVES. DON'T FORGET FROM 1 CORINTHIANS CHAPTER 6, THAT IT IS BETTER TO BE WRONGED THAN TO DO WRONG.
DRINKING TOO MUCH WINE LEADS TO BITTERNESS, RESENTMENT, AND CONFLICT. BEING DRUNK MAKES A FOOL LOSE HIS TEMPER. THIS IS TO HIS DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE HE BECOMES WEAKER AND GETS INJURED MORE OFTEN.
I LOVE THREE THINGS, AND THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MORTALS; BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT LIVE IN HARMONY, NEIGHBORS WHO ARE FRIENDS, AND A HUSBAND AND WIFE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER.

8598131,5,B00DV1DHH8,"It takes courage to tell your story to the world.  Lori Petty has done a terrific job at crafting a dark, stylized portrait of her own experiences.  Jennifer Lawrence is exceptional, long before blockbusters littered her resume, this film shows you her true talent.
 This is a film for film lovers.  Not a popcorn flick, this is a true arthouse film.",1457222400,,350,4.688524590163935
8598132,3,B00DV1DHH8,"Based on a true story that takes place in Iowa. Agnes (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 14 year old girl advanced for her age. She plays basketball, does calculus, holds down a local job, keeps the household together and gives dry boring narration about her life and dogs biting. Her mother (Selma Blair) owns the Poker House"" which is known for poker, gambling, drinking, prostitution, and apparently drugs, although the nightly antics are basically limited to one night, so the audience never got the real feeling of despair.

Bee (Sophi Bairley) is 12 years old and delivers papers. She stays at the neighbors whenever possible. Cammie (Chlo Grace Moretz) is the youngest and in spite of all the praise for J-Law, I couldn't wait for her character to come on screen as she rattled off at the mouth.

The story is slow. It spends time to fully develop the sisters' characters. Agnes, is coming of age and has a touch of Jungle Fever, which becomes both her demise and finally salvation. It is an interesting tale, but it felt incomplete. Personally I thought Lawrence's acting in ""Winterbone"" smoked this one.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape, nudity (Selma Blair) 3 1/2 stars

The film leads you to believe this was the bio for Lori Petty but her IMDB bio reads: ""She spent her childhood traveling the US with her father, a Pentecostal minister. Her keen talents first lent themselves toward being a graphic artist in Omaha, Nebraska, but an impulsive desire to act quickly took precedence and soon she was off to New York""

""She was the first female editor of the North High School newspaper and graduated in 1982.
Attended North High School, Sioux City, Iowa, where she was involved in Yearbook and speech/debate.""

The film suggests she left for NYC at 14. Seems to be some missing story.",1442793600,,1782,4.7882736156351795
8598133,1,B00DV1DHH8,The movie did nothing for me at all. It is the story about a girl growing up with a drug using parent who ends up with a guy who eventually rapes one of the daughters in a very graphic sex scene which was totally not necessary. I knew I should not have bought the movie after NOT seeing it in the guide titled The Definitive Guide To Girls In Coming Of Age Movies 2015. I'm going to smash the DVD and toss it in the recycling bin.,1434326400,,430,3.954022988505747
