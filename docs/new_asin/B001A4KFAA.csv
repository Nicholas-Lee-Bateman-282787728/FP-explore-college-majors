8719594,5,B001A4KFAA,"Truth be known, I find that revisiting a music-related DVD is something I don't often do.  Generally one viewing is enough for me.  I'm able to recall what I need when listening to the audio thereafter.  With Journey Into The Valley, however, I've found that returns to the DVD not only has been instructive, but downright entertaining!

Yes, the music is the primary draw for me.  But I can't discount the absolutely excellent filming/recording/mixing/mastering work done by Tim O'Brien.  The many camera angles, the artful timings of the changes in perspective, and the respect offered to the entire stage all works to the viewer's advantage.  And then we have some extra footage from the same date, some great interviews, and some of Faruq's intense poetry.  All of this to say--watching the DVD time and time again brings many rewards.

So don't let the small independent label concern you.  Journey Into The Valley is a fantastic release presenting Faruq Z. Bey backed by the equally accomplished Northwoods Improvisers.  With the DVD you also get a CD packed with some of the better tracks off the DVD--a very nice way to ""carry the music"" with you in the car!

Highly recommended.",1334361600,,1187,4.909547738693467
