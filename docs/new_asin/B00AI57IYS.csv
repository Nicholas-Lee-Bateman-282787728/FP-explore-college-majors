8551864,5,B00AI57IYS,"having seen this film at the japanese film festival in sydney 2 years ago , and having just come back from nagoya japan, i still think that this would have to be one the great all time comedy films. THANKS FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLE.  p.s. while in Japan i found out that there was a ""thermae romae  2 on the way. PLEASE CAN YOU LET US KNOW WHEN IT COMES OUT ON BLUE RAY.",1404345600,,384,3.9740259740259742
8551865,5,B00AI57IYS,I wonder if it is good since it has Chinese character on it (Japanese DVD). But it was totally fine. I enjoyed it.,1402876800,,114,4.0
8551866,3,B00AI57IYS,"I enjoyed this flick for its entertainment value, but the laughs stop less than halfway through the story. Then, we're seriously rooting for emperor Hadrian along with Modestus. Some of the best parts are carried by the supporting cast, like the professor, a guy with an Elvis pompadour, and Aya Ueto's father, as they help Lucius Modestus build a curative bath for the Roman soldiers in Pannonia. Some critics slammed the film for using an opera singer between Modestus' time-warps from Rome to modern Japan, but I thought the musical ploy fit the tale. Fact is, there aren't enough zany films produced these days with Hollywood's directorial preferences for car chases and comedies that get no laughs.

If anything negative can be said, I would have preferred to see Aya get a better deal than she got. Throughout the film, she's treated with indifference. When at last she fades away, Modestus could've at least reached out a hand toward her. This didn't happen because the film's director either hates women (a distinct possibility) or he was so insensitive that Aya's character simply slid down the proverbial drain. I give the movie four stars for chuckles and originality, but only three stars of directorial crudeness toward women.",1400112000,,1239,5.014563106796117
8551867,5,B00AI57IYS,"Its a rare movie that I love. And an even rarer one that everyone in my family also loves. We watched this over the Holidays and were all in various states of disbelief and stitches throughout the movie from start to finish.

The premise it that a failing Roman ""plumber"" travels by ""underwater accident"" back and forth from Rome to Modern Japan. And that he finds inspiration in Japan's modern pluming which he applies back home. Our hero can't quite figure out that he's travelling through time so he contends with the idea that there is a strange tribe of slaves somewhere in Rome whose ideas are profoundly superior to his own ... leading to existential angst.

That I can share some of this angst from our time travelling friends is proof of the movies zanny genius.",1390435200,3,771,4.62043795620438
8551868,5,B00AI57IYS,We saw this on our flight to Japan and the whole plane was laughing! Once we got this edition we still are laughing just as hard and so are our friends. Can't wait for the sequel to come out!,1390176000,6,191,3.923076923076923
8551869,5,B00AI57IYS,this movie is so funny with lots of Japanese bathing cultural aspects. Those who are familiar with it can really laugh about it!,1384387200,3,128,4.608695652173913
8551870,4,B00AI57IYS,"Lucius Modestus (Hiroshi Abe) is a serious-minded architect of the second century Roman Empire, having hard time coming up with a new idea for the public bathhouse. Luckily Lucius finds the inspiration for his next plan in an unexpected place, when he is mysteriously transported to modern-day Japan's ""sento"" or public bathhouse. There, the proud Roman is impressed with various ""innovations"" of the ""flat-faced slaves.""

Lucius, now a popular figure back in Rome, is commissioned by the Emperor Hadrian (Masachika Ichimura) to build a bath at the palace.

A live-action adaptation of Mari Yamazaki's hit comic, ""Thermae Romae"" starts out as a time-travelling comedy about a Roman bathhouse architect trying to make sense of all these modern technologies related to bath and other sanitary ware. Unlike Jean Reno in ""Les visiteurs"" Lucius goes back and forth in time several times, each time bringing back some unique ideas to his original time.

The narrative structure in the first half, which is faithful to that of the episodic comic, gets repetitious, but Hiroshi Abe as the dead serious Roman is always amusing. Charming Aya Ueto (""Azumi"") plays Mami, a wannabe manga creator in today's Japan. They could have explored the romantic side of the movie. Perhaps we should wait and see what happens in the sequel (now in production).

Part shot in Cinecitt Studios, the production design is surprisingly good. Japanese audience will enjoy recognizing some of Japan's character actors including Riki Takeuchi (""Dead or Alive"") and Hachir Ika, and other pop culture based jokes (reference to ""Fist of the North Star,"" for instance). Remember, like most comedies in the world, the film is made for the domestic market.

Still, the character of Lucius is fun to see, with Abe's effective performance that is funny without making his character a one-note caricature. The story loses its momentum towards the end, but the film itself is entertaining.",1368230400,2,1947,5.187898089171974
