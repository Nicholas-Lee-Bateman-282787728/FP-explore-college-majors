3926908,5,B002HEENRI,"As a senior fitness instructor and personal trainer I am always looking for programs to provide the results my clients are looking for, such as weight loss, strength, pain relief, or flexibility.  The Edmonde Technique is a worthwhile program and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exercise program that is gentle yet yields results. I purchased the CDs in coordination with the training manual, but the CDs work well by themselves unless you are interested in the anatomy point of view or detailed explanations of the different techniques used in the program as I was.",1290038400,73,581,4.928571428571429
3926909,5,B002HEENRI,"It took awhile for me to get into these workouts after purchase. A couple of years. I thought the exercises looked lame, stupid, and way too repetitive to hold my interest. Leg lifts. Whoopee.

After recovering from a spinal injury, feeling weak, suffering from fibromyalgia, and losing 30 pound on the Pain Diet, I tried to dedicate myself to just a few of these workouts, just to test moving around again.

So it's not just leg lifts, when it looks like just leg lifts, or arm lifts, or anything else. I tried to moderate these exercises so that I would not hurt myself, or cause a flare. Even 'taking it easy' left me knowing that I was working things that needed it.

Now, I do many of these exercizes in front of the TV, standing, on the floor. It is very easy to incorporate these movements into just about any activity I perform throughout the day. I have my flexibility back, and then some. I am unable to do most abdominal exercises, but have found exercises that I can do, that will leave me with a nice belly burn, and some of that delicious soreness where it counts.

Esmonde-White presents as bubbly and friendly. She is not always on top of her cues, and loses count sometimes. That is part of the charm, for me, anyway. There is no obnoxious, overwhelming music or personalities. No one is showing as much skin as they can possibly manage. So, by some of today's standards, these might be boring workouts.  They are workouts, however, and I feel like I have gotten what I paid for. I appreciate the focus on exactly what you are doing with your body, and how it is being affected.",1471651200,16,1595,4.4673539518900345

I'm new to Ms. Esmonde-White's technique, so am a little slow following some techniques, but I feel so wonderful after each session. I'm a retired woman, and lazy in my physical activity, but I don't have to talk myself into working with this DVD. I enjoy the format, and her style, and all that I am learning.

3926918,3,B002HEENRI,The stretches are gentle and easy to do. Some more strenuous than others and designed to target specific health problems or body parts. I like Miranda so I liked the workouts. I did have problems with the DVD itself. The case had a crack in it when I got it (thought outer packaging was fine). I ignored it at first because the DVD's looked okay. Only they weren't. In time I discovered that the sound cut out frequently on about 1/3 of the workouts. I don't know if I got bad copy or if it was truly damaged in shipment or if the seller had in fact sent me a used copy--whatever. Since so much time had elapsed since I first purchased it I just threw the whole thing out. All I can say is - buyer beware--and report problems immediately unlike me.,1450828800,4,748,4.2377622377622375

I checked out her website and found some help there, so I'll use the DVDs and hopefully over time I'll get better at following her routines.",1444176000,7,470,4.390804597701149

Thanks to  other reviewers, this particular set of lessons is very appropriate for a newbie.

3926960,4,B002HEENRI,"Classical Stretch season DVDs were originally played on PBS stations prior to being released on DVD.  All episodes from this season feature instructor/creator Miranda Esmonde-White alone. As opposed to latter seasons, Miranda gives longer introductions at the start of each episode here; she explains in detail the purpose of each workout. During the workout itself, she also refers to ""Chapter ___ in your manual."" These references are to her book, which serves as a companion to this series.

Miranda can be quite goofy, but I like her!  She is a bit less polished here than in the newer seasons--does miscount at times, and her cuing, while mirrored, isn't always the best.  However, these are flowing routines, not overly choreographed workouts that you have to follow along with exactly.

There are 3 discs to this season. I have broken down down each episode below. Please note that each workout, with introduction, is about 23-24 minutes long (to allow for a 30-minute TV slot, with commercials).

DISC 1

401, Deep Muscular Stretch
Miranda works out here poolside, and she states in her intro that she will be teaching you how to stretch. The warm-up includes toe taps, kickbacks, and arm circles. There is a brief plie segment followed by whole body stretches which emphasize making a c-curve with the back and stretching the joints. With 12 minutes left, Miranda moves to the floor for side-lying work for both the inner & outer thigh, and she finishes in a seated position for hip, back, & groin stretches.

402, Toning & Slenderizing
This workout, which takes place by a miniature pool, is designed to focus on eccentric elongation. In the warm-up, Miranda performs big arm swings, shakes, plus front & side leg kicks with balance. The standing stretch includes both front & side lunges and pulling moves. At the 12 minute point, Miranda moves to the floor for about 6 minutes of side leg lifts, 3 minutes of abs work, and then 3 minutes of seated full body stretches (including leg lifts).

403, Muscular Tension Release
Here Miranda states that the emphasis will be on stretching effectively using PNF (contracting & releasing of muscles); she is on an outdoor path for this workout. The warm-up includes joint & waist rotations, throws, little kicks, & curls; this is followed by a brief segment of arms work. Miranda next focuses on using PNF for the back & hips, then moves into full-body stretches which continue to use tensing & releasing. With 11.5 minutes to go, she transitions to the floor for lying hips and hamstring work. She finishes with seated groin stretches & additional PNF work, including the neck.

404, Pain Relief
This workout is performed on a balcony overlooking a pool. Miranda states that you will be working on straightening out the body's fascia in order to reduce pain. The warm-up (which is performed without music!) includes punches & kicks; it moves abruptly into a brief arms work sequence. A series of gentle full body stretches follows, and then with 12 minutes to go, Miranda begins barre work, stretching the hips, hamstrings, psoas, and quads. At the 5.5 minute mark, Miranda moves to the floor for additional groin, calf, & neck stretches.

405, The Spine
Here Miranda is exercising in an covered hallway outdoors. She begins the warm-up with arm swings plus Frisbee & ball throws, and she moves right into stretches for the hips, psoas, and calves. The standing segment emphasizes use of PNF. At the 12 minute point, Miranda transitions to the floor for work on the stomach, performing locust variations. She then moves to her back for hip & hamstring stretches, followed by about 3 minutes of abs work. The workout concludes with a brief reclined stretch & seated stretches.

406, Muscle Memory
For this workout, Miranda is pondside on a golf course. During the warm-up, she focuses on loosening the hips & includes some brief arms work; a short plie sequence follows. For the standing stretch, Miranda focuses on maximum reaches, windmills, and pulling weeds. With 12 minutes to go, she moves to the floor for hip & hamstring stretches using PNF. After 3 minutes of abs work, Miranda finishes with 3 minutes of seated stretches.

407, Maximum Flexibility
For this workout, which takes place by an outdoor pool, Miranda begins with Figure 8 moves for the arms, circles, and some marches. She performs plies combined with arms work and then moves into standing stretches which include side lunge & open swan. At the 12.5 minute mark, she comes to a seated position with the legs in front of her for various stretches which target the hips, IT band, & ribs. She continues with back & quad stretches and finishes with stretching the back & neck.

408, Scar Tissue
Miranda states that in order to target the scar tissue, this workout will focus more on the joint and range of motion; it takes place on the beach. The warm-up consists mostly of moves to shake out the joints. Miranda then starts right in with barre work, performing hip cleaners, leg lifts, and rotations. She also performs stretches with the barre, targeting the hips, quad, psoas, and finally the back. At the 11-minute mark, Miranda moves to a side-lying position on the floor for more hip stretches. She comes to seated for quad & calf stretches and finishes with PNF work in a butterfly position.

409, Posture (Pulling Up & Turning Out)
Miranda is again by the mini-pool for this workout. During the warm-up, she includes cross-country skiing, little kicks, and big swings. She follows this with balance work, adding a balance challenge to the standing flow stretches as well. With 11.5 minutes to go, she switches to performing plies and then leg lifts to the side & front with balance. Miranda concludes this workout with additional full-body stretches, including familiar moves such as the table twist, the bell-ringer, and pick a flower.

DISC 2

410, Hip Flexibility
Miranda describes this workout, which is performed on a outdoor patio, as addressing ""body awareness.' The warm-up includes shaking plus Frisbee & tennis moves. Following this, Miranda moves into balancing leg lifts to the front, side, and back. With 11.5 minutes left, she moves to seated on the floor with the feet out in front, performing twists for the hips, ribs, and IT band. She also does a pretzel quad stretch and then returns the feet to the front for some seated leg lifts; she finishes with brief neck stretches.

411, Muscular Balance
On an outdoor balcony overlooking a pool, Miranda starts with a warm-up that includes moves for the arms and fingers. She follows this with balancing leg lifts to the front & side; next, the standing stretch emphasizes side lunges and windmills. With 12 minutes to go, Miranda moves to a barre for hip, hamstring, psoas, and quad stretches. At the 6 minute mark, she goes to the floor for 3 minutes of abs work and then finishes with 3 minutes of seated stretches focused on the abs.

412, Alignment
Here, Miranda states that the focus will be on both alignment & application; she works out on an outdoor covered patio. The warm-up includes shaking for the hands, shoulders, and feet. This is followed by aligning the feet with lunges and then full body stretches with side, front, & back lunges plus airplane. After a rather lengthy add for vacationing in Cancun(!), the floorwork begins at 9 minutes left with 3 minutes of abs work. Miranda concludes with 4 minutes of lying hips stretches and 1 minutes of seated groin work.

413, Opposing Muscle Groups
This workout involves agonist & antagonist work. Because it takes place on a golf course, Miranda incorporates some golf moves as well as wrist stretches & feet articulation into the warm-up (which oddly has no music). She then performs some gentle plie work involving tensing/releasing the quads & hamstrings followed by a standing stretch emphasizing side stretches (and some neck work). With 11 minutes left, Miranda moves to a barre for a long (6 minutes) series of hip stretches; she concludes with some balance calf work & upper body stretches using the chair.

414, Strengthening
This workout takes place on the beach; Miranda states that it involves eccentric pulling & strengthening. The warm-up is gentle & includes slow Tai Chi-like moves. This is followed by about 2.5 minutes of tough arms work, and then Miranda goes right to the floor for a fairly long (almost 5 minutes) situp sequence. Next come side leg lifts, and Miranda finishes with a long seated stretch (including seated on heels).

415, Posture 2
Miranda states that the goal of this workout is to protect the joints; it takes place poolside. The warm-up includes leg kicks and then is followed by 3 minutes of hand & wrist work. The standing stretch emphasizes washes and includes some shoulder extensions. This is followed by plies and some standing hip work/lunges. With 6 minutes left, Miranda goes to the floor for 3 minutes of situps; she follows this with brief lying hip stretches and then finishes with seated shoulder stretches.

416, Muscle Chains
Miranda performs this workout on an outdoor patio by a small pool. The warm-up includes arms work. Next, Miranda performs moves which she says will help frozen shoulder; this includes cow-face arms plus triceps & shoulder stretches. The standing stretch continues to emphasize the shoulders and includes Figure 8s. With 12 minutes left, Miranda moves to the barre to stretch the calves, back, hips, & psoas; the final 6 minutes are performed on the floor to stretch the hips & hamstrings.

417, Eccentric Stretching
In her long introduction to this workout, Miranda states that the purpose is to use force the muscles to the maximum using PNF to stretch & heal; she is exercising on an outdoor patio. The warm-up starts with toe articulations and includes leg kicks to the front, side, & back. Next come plies with tensing & releasing and then stretches for the hips, calves, and hamstrings. At 10 minutes to go, Miranda moves to the floor for side-lying work; this is followed by prone & child's pose stretches. She concludes seated with the legs in front for back stretches.

418, Abdominals
Exercising on an outdoor lawn, Miranda explains that the focus of this workout will be on flattening the stomach by keeping it pulled in throughout the workout. During the warm-up, which includes knee lifts & kicks, she emphasizes holding in the stomach. This is followed by balancing leg kicks, keeping the stomach hold in mind; the standing work concludes with the clock (1-way only). With 12 minutes left, Miranda moves to the floor for abs work: she performs 3 minutes of her traditional abs moves & then 3 minutes move of bicycle-like moves. Coming to seated, she does 3 minutes of stretches for the abs, and moving the legs straight out front, she concludes with a final 3 minutes of stretching.

DISC 3

419, Anti-Aging
Miranda leads this one on an outdoor patio setting. She explains in the beginning that there are differences between active, passive, and ballistic movements, and in CS, the latter is used only for arms work. The warm-up for this one is more choreographed than we usually see in CS, with knee-ups, Charleston, and some ballistic arms movements. Miranda then goes into a nice long arms segment. The standing section emphasizes washes and twists for the back. With 11 minutes left, Miranda moves to a prone position for cobra moves, then flips onto her back for about 3 minutes of abs work. She concludes with lying hip/hamstring stretches and finishes seated with cobbler's & back stretches.

420, Back Pain Relief
Miranda leads this one in what looks like a covered outdoor hallway. She states that it is a gentle program for when you are in active pain. It begins with about 6 minutes of very gentle standing stretches. Miranda then continues the standing stretches using a chair for additional side & back stretches. With 12 minutes left, she puts one foot on the chair to stretch the psoas as well as the hamstrings & hips. She moves to the floor with 9 minutes left for cobra & child's pose stretches, then flips onto the back for situps, emphasizing the idea of the pelvic tilt. The program ends with an additional few minutes of gentle stretches.

421, Back Pain Prevention
Miranda states that this one is designed to prevent chronic back pain attacks. She suggests that you can just pick & choose exercises which you find helpful from the program and do those only. Miranda starts using a chair in a standing position for about 4 minutes of various pelvic tuck and rotation-type moves. She then places one foot on the chair to stretch the psoas, hamstrings, & hips as well as sits in the chair for additional tucks & rotations. The floorwork starts at about 12 minutes left: first, Miranda performs several variations of child's pose, stretching the back from several different angles; she then does cat/cow as well as additional seated twists & stretches. Moving to lying on the back, she does mini versions of her usual hips & hamstrings stretches, and she concludes with brief seated stretches.

422, Stretching for Cardio
As Miranda explains in her intro, the ""Stretching for Cardio"" in the title refers to improving circulation, so the purpose of this program is stretching to the maximum, or to the very ends of the limbs. To this end, the warm-up includes a lot of very large arm movements. This is followed by a plie segment which includes held arm moves. The full body stretch includes both airplane & clock. The floorwork (starts w/12 minutes left) consists entirely of stretches: Miranda starts with the legs straight out in front for some upper body, hip, & hamstring stretches, and she concludes with a long sequence of quad stretches, including the calf in this series.

423, Strengthening 2
Miranda states that this program, which takes place on an outdoor patio, focuses on stretching & strengthening to lose weight and so emphasizes more of the cardio aspects of CS. The warm-up incorporates big arm moves and little kicks. This is followed by a short by tough arms work segment. The standing series includes a good deal of pushing a unique side windmill. With 11.5 minutes to go, Miranda moves to the floor for some side extensors work as well as some brief leg lifts. Abs work follows, and then Miranda concludes with hip & hamstring stretches on the back.

424, Anti-Aging 2
For this outdoor workout, Miranda notes that the emphasis is going to be on rotational moves to lubricate the joints and help you to keep moving. The warm-up begins with arm swings and little kicks. Miranda then moves right into stretching, going from stretching the long vs. short muscles for the hips, thighs, and hamstrings and then moving on to stretching the shoulders and the entire body. With 12 minutes left, Miranda moves to the floor for lying hamstring stretches, seated groin (butterfly) stretches, seated quad stretches, and seated leg extensions.

425, Digestive System
Miranda leads this workout in an outdoor grassy area. She reveals during the intro that it is designed to help with an embarrassing problem: constipation. To address this, she incorporates many ""twisty"" movements immediately into the warm-up; she also includes ""fake sports"" moves. Next come Tai Chi plies, but Miranda adds rotational hip moves in several different positions. This is followed by what Miranda calls ""deep stretches for the entire torso""; I could feel this work in my upper back as well. At the halfway mark, Miranda continues the standing work with calf & inner thigh stretches as well as some quick kicks. Finally, with just 6.5 minutes to go, she moves to the floor for some abs work. She then finishes with some seated twists and a butterfly stretches. On note about this episode: there were several instances where Miranda counted incorrectly.

426, Injury Prevention
This episode takes place in an outdoor grassy pondside setting. Miranda states that in order to prevent injuries, it is important to pay attention to how you are transferring your body weight, so the emphasis of this workout is on transfers. During the warm-up, Miranda is constantly reminding you to keep your stomach in while lifting up and performing various knees up moves. A brief plie segment follows, and then the standing stretch series emphasizes smooth transfers of your weight as you flow from side to side. With 12.5 minutes left, Miranda goes to the floor for a long (about 6 minutes) side-lying legwork series. This is followed by abs work and then some final stretches that felt fairly rushed: Miranda performs a few on the back, then a few more seated.",1405123200,197,16598,4.892920668801138
3926961,5,B002HEENRI,"This is a great program.  It has a lot of information to help with getting into shape.  What is really nice is that, even though it is a tough work out, it does not hurt my joints with high impact moves.",1394755200,17,203,3.926829268292683
3926962,1,B002HEENRI,"I saw her show while I was in CT and her technique made sense to me. I have been exercising for over 30 years.  So I bought this season.  I was very disappointed because she is the worst instructor ever.  Her transitions are harmful.  I've actually pulled muscles trying to align my routine with her.

I wish someone else could instruct using her techniques.",1383004800,6,358,4.53125
3926963,5,B002HEENRI,The Stretch is just what I wanted.  It is well done and gives me a lot to aspire to in completing it.,1375920000,,101,3.590909090909091
3926964,5,B002HEENRI,This is an exersize program. I think if you are looking for something to solve any kind of body pain. Look no more this is the program for you.,1375228800,,143,3.9655172413793105
3926965,4,B002HEENRI,"Wow! Great stretch workouts that begin with easy warmups.  Quite a nice level of fun and cheerfulness, which counts for a lot.  Excellent value with three DVD's of 9 half-hour workouts per disc.

Esmonde is a former ballerina who discovered several key stretch and muscular healing techniques during her own physical therapy following a debilitating back injury.

She used the best of these techniques by creating a wide range of stretches that are the basis of her PBS show Classical Stretch.  There's a lot of active stretching, moving while you work, so that it's not boring.

Most of the episodes are themed, although the titles don't always seem accurate.  The two back pain ones on disc 3 are worth the price of the entire collection.  Perfect if you have just injured your back (one of the episodes) or if you have a bad back in general and you just want to soothe and remove any pain there.  Some users may find that some of the episodes have some really excruciatingly difficult stretches, but as Esmonde likes to say, she works with Olympic athletes who badly need these exercises, so ANYone at any fitness level reaps real benefits from such stretches. Keep at it (she always stresses working to YOUR level of ability at first) and you will notice gradual and definite improvement.

Pluses: she has a fantastic technique, the stretches make my body feel great, and the settings and workouts are varied enough to never be boring.  Interesting music sometimes. The approx 27 mins per workout is not time consuming.  Esmonde is cute and very positive, very encouraging.  She USUALLY gives very precise instructions about joint positions or postures during a stretch.  You'll find the episodes that are easy for you and challenging for you, and you can choose, then, how tough you want to go.

Minuses: she sometimes loses count and you end up doing a few more of one thing on side and not the other.  This happens maybe 4 times total, but it's annoying.  She'll also sometimes give more time to stretching one side (leg, usually) and this is annoying too.  Once in a while the camera angle will not capture the exact position of a foot, a hip or a leg (whether it's bent over the knee, which direction it bends, etc): extREMely annoying, as body position is EVerything.  In almost every one of these workouts, she refers viewer to some page or chapter ""in your study guide"", but the study guide doesn't come with the DVDs and when I searched for it online, it's like $125 or so.  Grumble grumble, further annoyance.

Virtually all ages can do these workouts: my young personal trainer friend likes the Esmonde technique and incorporates some of these stretches in her work with clients.  For middle-aged me: I stretched to one routine for 25 years, and although it was a decent repertoire based on a dancer's stretches, upon changing to the Esmonde technique, I find I can really dig in to some areas I had neglected to my detriment.  And it helps my spine health (I see a chiropractor).  Not quite as dedicated to exercise as I once was, I find that these workouts are REALLY good whenever I do one after a stint of low activity... very rejuvenating and motivating for me.  If I follow with a weight workout, I feel totally ready for whatever I might pile on next.",1371427200,62,3273,4.690017513134851
3926966,3,B002HEENRI,"Miranda has good information to share at the beginning of the series.  However, it cuts into the workout, making them rather short.",1359590400,2,131,4.954545454545454
3926967,4,B002HEENRI,"I have a long commute and many demands on my time, so going to the gym or devoting a lot of time to an exercise routine are not in the cards for me. The Classical Stretch videos have been a godsend.  I can take my yoga mat and DVDs into an unused conference room during my break, stretch, strengthen and relax and still have time to freshen up before I get back to work. I find the explanations of the effects that each movement has on my body to be very helpful and Miranda's sometimes funny digressions make you feel more like you're in a class than watching a video.",1298592000,36,569,4.172727272727273
3926968,3,B002HEENRI,"I bought this expensive video set because I saw her on a PBS station and liked her basic stretches.  So I ordered the video.

I am so disppointed.  She spends way too much time talking and viewing the scenery.  I don't care about the scenery I just want to do my stretches with a video instructor that flows smoothly and doesn't stop constantly to explain body parts. Its annoying and a waste of time.

If an instructor wants to talk, please do an intro section to address these concerns/techniques, etc and then have regular stretching sections that flow with continuity.

I will never buy another one of her videos.
I have to mute it and fast forward constantly just to maintain a routine.  Do not purchase unless you want to be told every single time what to do and when and how and why.",1294185600,11,790,4.444444444444445
8370236,4,B002HEENRI,"I bought this one after buying/loving her ""Classical Stretch by Essentrics Age-Reversing Workout Mobility & Bone-Strengthening for Beginners"" (which is wonderful!)  because I'd heard that Season 4 is also beginner-level.  Actually, the workouts here are more quickly paced, more intense, but don't let that discourage you. Stay with it and you'll be up to speed soon.
So - lots of great workouts, lots of good information. You can trust Miranda Esmonde-White's workouts will be good for your entire body.

BUT ... be aware that these workouts were done in standard-definition video and then upconverted for HD, so the picture is not as sharp as I expected it would be.  The audio level (loud/soft) varies noticeably between segments. There are often times when Miranda has to fuss with her earpiece. The videography relied on natural light, which means sometimes Miranda is in shadow.  I found these technical aspects distracting the first time through, but truly you're here for the workout, so let it go.",1492041600,2,1006,5.147239263803681

8370242,5,B002HEENRI,Never tried an exercise video before but my wife cajoled me into buying and trying it. Glad I did. It focuses on stretching and I needed it (although I didn't know I did). We both have benefited from using it - and we do them (several routines on the video - about 30 minutes each - for different muscle groups) regularly. Everything becomes easier - energy improves - stress drops - aches and pains diminish. We're devoted Mirandaites - she makes it easy.,1484784000,,456,4.506024096385542
