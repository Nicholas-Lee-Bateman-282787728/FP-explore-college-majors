I would like my money back, and,if it is not returned, I will think twice about ordering through Amazon.com again.",1444608000,,261,4.673913043478261
7906924,5,B00000F4YD,My favorite play of all time. Athol Fugard's play is heartachingly nuanced and exquisite. Zakes Mokae's silken gravitas is a privilege to watch. Matthew Broderick is a phenom as a young man caught in these cross currents. Lovely work by John Kani.,1359158400,,247,4.904761904761905
7906925,4,B00000F4YD,"This powerful three-character play, set in Port Elizabeth, South Africa in 1950, considers the interwoven relationships of young Harold (Hally), the seventeen-year-old son of the white proprietor of a tea room, and the two African men who have worked there for years. Hally has always considered Sam, the waiter, as a kind of father substitute, looking to him for guidance about the real world, since his undependable, alcoholic father has been living in an institution. When Hally's father is released from the hospital, Hally's fear of the future leads him to turn on Sam, releasing racial prejudice which has always before been hidden and damaging their relationship significantly.

Zakes Mokae portrays Sam, a person of vision and nobility who dominates the action of this powerful and poignant drama. Stunning in his ability to draw out the audience's emotions, Mokae keeps his delivery low key and his actions subtle. Matthew Broderick, as Hally, looks like a schoolboy here, but at age twenty-four in 1986, when this play was filmed, he has wide experience in the theater upon which to draw for this demanding role, and he does a terrific, if somewhat ""stagey,"" job.  John Kani, as Willie, the custodian, is a foil for both Broderick and Mokae, and while not exactly a buffoon, he is a character without subtlety or introspection, and Kani plays the role broadly.

Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg makes full use of the close-up to reveal feelings, including tears, and the action is almost completely internal. The only real movement on stage consists of Sam and Willie practicing their ballroom dancing for a contest, something that gives beauty, fun, and excitement to their lives, even though Hally demeans their efforts, explaining that ""primitive black society [always] includes singing and dancing."" Less a political drama than a human one, the play, based on an incident in the life of the author, rises above its immediate setting in South Africa during apartheid to consider universal feelings and human relationships.

7906926,5,B00000F4YD,"Having seen both this version televised and a live performance of ""Master Harold and the Boys"", I can't think of a play that has touched me more.  It is a truely wrentching look at the effect that prejudice and peer pressure can have on a loving relationshp.  The performances in this production are outstanding - a side of Matthew Broderick's talent that will amaze.  John Kani as Willie and Zakes Mokae as Sam give equally impressive performances.
Highly recommended...but make sure you've got a box of tissues on-hand!",1042675200,3,521,4.8977272727272725
7906927,5,B00000F4YD,"This 1984  filming of the most famous South African play preserves the most accomplished work of the adolescent Matthew Broderick and a heartbreaking performance by the great South African actor Zakes Mokae, who played Sam in the first production (at Yale in 1982).Although very, very talkie, and unabashedly a record of a stage work with three actors on a fairly simple set, the film is not visually static. There are many closeups, seemingly more often of reaction shots than of the speaker.
The play is set in 1950, two years after the enactment of apartheid restrictions in South Africa. The reduction of black adults to a status below that of a bratty, damaged white adolescent is central to the play.
One might wonder if the dismantling of apartheid makes this drama any less compelling. Seeing it both onstage and on video last week, I would answer: not at all. Though I knew what was coming, it still packed quite a punch. The situation of an economically privileged youth being parented by servants is not at all unique to South Africa of apartheid times. Indeed, the play could have been set in the American South of the same time with no change other than making the tea-shop a caf. The emotional dynamics of the relationships do not even require racial differences between the boss's son and the workers, though some of the particular force of the last half hour rests on the racism institutionalized by apartheid.",991180800,12,1426,4.820408163265306

7906929,5,B00000F4YD,"Master Harold and the boys, a teleplay by Athol Fugard, starring Matthew Broderick and Zakes Mokae , reflects the tragedy of apartheid as it effects a teenage boy and his two servants.  Both actors give phenominal  performances is this little recognized drama.  As a viewer you revel in  their joyous memories and are brought to shocking tears as their friendship  is torn through misplaced hate and fear.  This is a must see, if you want  to view apartheid on a interpersonal level.",911779200,3,483,4.817073170731708
