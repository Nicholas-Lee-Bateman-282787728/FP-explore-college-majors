The film begins in an urban setting. The East Side Kids are taken in and placed on a bus for a ride into the country for two weeks. They hear a warning about a maniac who has killed three persons and may be in the vicinity. At night the boys hear some howling. A stranger comes to visit the long empty Billings estate. Dr. Van Grosch shows up next and asks the station master to keep his presence secret. The boys go exploring the countryside at night; a shot is fired and the boys seek refuge at a lone house. The owner leads them upstairs to a bedroom so PeeWee can rest well. The others will stay in another room. [There is no electricity in those days.]

PeeWee awakes and walks out of the room. The boys show up and search for him. They wander around the house. Some of the jokes are no longer funny. A stranger offers a ride to the nurse and she accepts. In town the men get their firearms to search for the monster at the Billings estate. The identity of the mysterious stranger is revealed. Linda screams and the men rush to her aid. The monster is caught for a happy ending. [This story will not strain your brain.]",1471132800,,1152,4.2318181818181815

8369876,5,B002GOAGOS,They made this film again with David Niven. There was no need (like many remakes) because this is brilliant.,1460592000,,108,4.7368421052631575
8369877,1,B002GOAGOS,"Poor quality reproduction.  I agree with the other reviewer. I played the collection on two separate DVD devices to verify.  Too many artifacts (blobs of dust) and jerky movements.  The sound was muddy.  For films with snappy dialogue, these were a disappointment.  Closed captioning was not available.

A side note, I usually check for closed-captioning before I purchase a DVD, this time I was too enticed by the low price.  Generally, inclusion of CC indicates slightly better quality DVD production.  And, NO, simply turning up the TV volume does not help.",1280880000,8,560,5.076923076923077
8369878,1,B002GOAGOS,"Beware of bogus claims of remastering.  These are unbelievably bad transfers, even of the newer movies.  It is a complete rip off, preying on people's love for these wonderful old movies.  Spend the time to research and purchase only legitimate remasters, even if you end up paying a little more.  Trust me:  these are so bad as to be annoying and to destroy your enjoyment.",1279584000,10,374,4.6923076923076925
