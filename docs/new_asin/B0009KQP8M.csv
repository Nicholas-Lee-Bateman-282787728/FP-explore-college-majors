8062904,5,B0009KQP8M,"This collection of episodes has to be about the best out of all the others. in fact, I remembered most of them from watching the show on TV. The disc includes 6 episodes which are:

1. No Business Like Snow Business- Champ helps a young skier regain his confidence on the slopes while beastly and shreeky try to capture him.
2. Caring for spring- grams tells hugs and tugs a story about mother nature and the wicked witch of winter.
3. Ski Trouble- When bright heart goes skiing by himself, Beastly and Shreeky try to capture him.
4. The Frozen Forest- the crew of the S.S. Friendship is in big trouble when Beastly and Shreeky plan to use a freezing ray to turn them into ice.
5. Ti's Raining, It's Boring- On a rainy day, Hugs and Tugs overcome the Beast of boredom by finding lots of exciting things to do.
6. The Cloud Monster- Bright Heart learns the value of teamwork when a cloud monster, created by No Heart, starts to eat the Care Bears' home.

This disc contains a few lessons in safety, like not going off alone without telling anyone where your going. and also a few tips on what to do on a rainy day. Its a fun disc for everybody.",1181952000,3,1143,4.311627906976744
8062905,3,B0009KQP8M,"I've never seen a Care Bears cartoon until now other than one of the modern CGI movies (which made me want to vomit) but I was expecting them to be better, not to say they were bad.  On the contrary, I'll be renting another disc.

This was pure 80's which meant there were goods guys & bad guys, the animation was top notch (and actual animation unlike a lot of the garbage today) & it was strong on teaching morals to the viewer (something else that's completely foriegn to today's stuff).  The one thing I can point to that I didn't like was the villianess Shreeky.  I don't like cartoon characters who shriek & yell, teaching kids bad habits.",1165708800,,645,4.394957983193278
