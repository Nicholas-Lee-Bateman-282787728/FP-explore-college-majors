5993344,3,B00FIO19QM,Got a replacement DVD-R copy of the movie today. I sent the first one back due to it ALSO being a DVD-R. Will be returning it again.,1405641600,,132,3.925925925925926
5993345,4,B00FIO19QM,"I liked Alter Ego (A School Conjuring). It's not as scary as The Ring or The Grudge, but it does have it's creepy moments. And the concept of mirror creatures and the way they kill people, I find interesting and unique.",1399334400,3,219,4.365853658536586
5993346,2,B00FIO19QM,"While Takashi Shimizu's name is prominently displayed in the description, I have to warn you that this movie is NOT at his caliber. In the credits, he's listed as ""supervising director"". I am not sure what role he played. It would seem that either he really loves whoever did this film and wanted to help out OR he lost a bet OR he was paid an insane amount of money to add his name to it (not likely given the lo budget quality of this film). I assume this movie is low budget, given the very low production values. It looks fuzzy and reminds me of a poor VHS. The story line is thin. The characters in the film are met with their lookalikes, which leads to their demise, as per a legend. There is nothing creepy or disturbing or even scary about the visuals in the film. The acting is adequate to subpar though none of the characters are likeable. I am very sorry I rented this.",1391385600,5,880,4.244047619047619
5993347,5,B00FIO19QM,"Finally being released anywhere for the first time this is one of Takashi Shimizu (The Grudge, Ju-On, and upcoming 7500) earlier works. Here he is also working with some individuals both behind and in front of the camera you'll notice and recognize that pop up in his later classic Japanese horror feature films.  Self contained and creepy story/atmosphere that we've come to expect from that country across the Pacific.",1380931200,5,420,5.086956521739131
5993348,2,B00FIO19QM,"Normally I really enjoy films like this, the cheap special effects are to be expected. The sub-par acting can be overlooked. Plot wasn't really spectacular, but it wasn't that bad either. My major complaint, whatever moron they hired to do the subtitles did a horrible job. Almost every line was mistimed from the audio. Either they didn't even watch the movie, or they plain didn't care. It was really hard to finish for this reason alone!",1423353600,,440,4.802631578947368
5993349,5,B00FIO19QM,If you enjoyed any of the Ju-on films then you're in for a treat. This film has all the elements needed to give that genuine eerie factor we long for in a ju-on film; and the run time is satisfyingly appropriate.,1423008000,,212,4.195121951219512
5993350,3,B00FIO19QM,"It was entertaining.  Three stars because I like the Director.  Not to say that it was great, or fantastic... nor would I stay that it was horrible or not good.  It was entertaining.  Would I watch it again?  Yep... just let me get the absolut and cranberry juice first.  :)",1419638400,,274,4.38
5993351,4,B00FIO19QM,"Alter Ego was an entertaining movie, even if it didn't have an engrossing plot.

In the film, three potential teen idols go to an abandoned school for a photo shoot. They're in the beginning stages of their careers, but the producer seems to have misgivings about them. In any case, the movie takes a twist into the bizarre, when one of the girls tells an urban legend about how you can summon demons out of a mirror, by facing two mirrors together. If done right, the demon will leave the mirror, looking exactly like the person who summoned it. If it finds the person, it kills them.

At that point the film goes down a strange, yet interesting road of terror, where everyone has to contend with copies of themselves, hunting them around the school.

Well I don't know what to say about this one. I can tell you I found it entertaining. Not so much on a horror level. More on a, I gotta see how all this turns out, kinda way. The story starts off pretty standard. But once the group runs into trouble, you just want to see what happens next. That's the best way to describe it.

The acting was fair, and the film adds enough in the way of minnie and major conflicts, to hold the story together. And I don't know why, but  abandoned Japanese schools always make great suspense locations.  Even if the plot was a little thin, you still feel drawn into the story enough to finish the movie off. The ending was good and made sense. There was even a funny scene where a narcissistic girl finds a copy of herself, but she seems to enjoy looking at herself, despite the danger.

My only complaint would be the explanation of how this all got started. But in a way, you have to view this story more like a, what would happen if an urban legend came true, type of film. Kind of like, what if Bloody Mary really came out of your mirror. If you view the film on that level, you won't be disappointed.

Alter Ego is offered in Japanese only, with English subtitles. No other features appear on the DVD other than a few trailers of other films.

 In the end, Alter Ego is a rather fun, slightly creepy, slightly bizzare film, that doesn't push too far into your face. It just entertains you, and that was good enough for me.

Worth a rental at least.",1419033600,2,2239,4.345323741007194
5993352,5,B00FIO19QM,Really good AND scarey.,1418860800,,23,5.0
5993353,3,B00FIO19QM,It was ok,1417824000,,9,2.3333333333333335
5993354,3,B00FIO19QM,"Typical of most B rated movies.  I read the reviews on this movie, but still decided to watch it.  The premise of the story was weak. The whole 'put two mirrors together and you will see your dead self"",made no sese especially since we never saw them do it. The only redeeming quality was at the very in when they tried to tie the loose ends together.  If you have nothing better to do, take a chance on this as a last resort.  Not the worst T've seen, but far from the best.",1417132800,,475,4.075268817204301
5993355,2,B00FIO19QM,"Just like this review, I'm thankful it was short. This is one of those stories that is better left to anime and manga's.",1416787200,,120,4.260869565217392

5993357,3,B00FIO19QM,"The move really wasn't scary.  It held together well enough, though it was confusing at first.  The premise is that if a person puts two mirrors facing each other, they will see their ""dead"" face in the reflection.  Or you see the devil.  Apparently, the myth has a lot of variations.  What was confusing is that these people were being hunted down by their doubles, and yet you didn't see any of the characters try the initial experiment that should have unleashed the mayhem.  Usually horror movies have the characters doing something stupid--watching the cursed video tape, going into the haunted house, etc.  Here, they didn't do anything wrong, and yet they were being hunted.

However, the explanation does come at the end.

This movie felt rather short.  It felt like one of those after-school horror shorts you sometimes watch.  There was not much development--it got pretty much to the point right away.

It was entertaining enough, but it wasn't really something I'll want to see again.",1413158400,3,996,4.8982035928143715
8615949,4,B00FIO19QM,"Lots of cute girls, creepy old dude, hero dude, protective older woman and demons! Cute girls in a school where everyone gets killed off one by one. Not original, but not bad at all, plus it's got lots of cute girls! The demon faces are really funny looking, too.

8615950,2,B00FIO19QM,"Did the internet try to erase the existence of this movie? It seems like it tried. Not 100% waste of time but I can see how someone who helped direct movies like ""Ju On"" would want this movie to disappear",1461024000,,204,4.125
8615951,4,B00FIO19QM,"Not bad at all! I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was, actually... it's not perfect, and the effects are pretty cheesy - but it also takes a light-hearted, self-deprecating view toward the effects (in other words, I think they knew the effects weren't going to look scary, so they played them for laughs more than horror). It was a cool story, most of the actors were good, and it was definitely worth watching - especially if you're like me, and can never get enough of Asian horror!  I wouldn't give it 5 stars, but I think it's a pretty solid 4.",1456963200,,556,4.295238095238095

8615953,4,B00FIO19QM,"This is an interesting J-horror take on the mirror stories (Bloody Mary, Candyman), which tend to terrify me just on general principal, from the same person who brought us The Grudge series (which terrified me very specifically). It's early and appears to be very low budget, but surprisingly deep and scary. Like a mirror itself, it distorts and reveals, and the deeper undercurrent seems to have something to say about childhood exploitation.

The subtitles were a bit off.",1446422400,,475,5.089743589743589

I'm baffled by the great reviews, but perhaps the DVD's subtitling is of better quality than the streaming.",1427846400,,320,4.818181818181818
8615958,3,B00FIO19QM,"I get that it is an earlier work, hence the 3 stars. Good all the way through but...

I am Japanese and the English subtitles were not in sink with the dialogue. With me knowing enough Japanese and referring to the translation when the speech was over complicated, well, needless to say, it was difficult to fully digest this film. Also like many other Japanese translations, a lot of the nuance was lost when translated into English.

Hey, maybe someone should make a movie about that.",1427155200,3,486,4.6395348837209305
