8234217,5,B000YVBF8Q,"This happens to be a favorite workout routine. Kimberly Spreen is exact on all of her cues. I never miss a step.
I just wish she was still producing exercise  DVD'S",1378598400,,164,4.290322580645161
8234218,4,B000YVBF8Q,"I do enjoy Kimberly Spreen workouts, and this is no exception.  There are three workouts although the last one is more of a funky cool down/stretch with nice music and a dance groove.  I like doing one of the first two workouts and following up with the last one.  It isn't a difficult set of workouts but it is a nice workout.",1361232000,2,327,4.241935483870968
8234219,5,B000YVBF8Q,Kimberly Spreen is one of my top five favorite instructors.  She cues almost flawlesssly.  Doing her workouts is always a pleasure.,1359936000,,131,5.190476190476191
8234220,5,B000YVBF8Q,"Kimberly Spreen has such a sweet, helpful, girl-next-door personality, it's impossible not to like her.  She genuinely seems to want to make sure you get the moves down.  Each of the three workouts -- kickboxing, med ball, and ""yoga flow"" -- is 30 minutes long, so I generally do either the kickboxing or med ball workouts and follow that up with the yoga flow, which has a great toning effect of its own.  The production value is fairly low -- but the music is great, the workout is terrific, and Kimberly demonstrates her rhythmic flair while giving excellent form pointers and staying on the beat (something that not all instructors seem to be able to do!)",1305849600,2,659,4.663793103448276
8234221,5,B000YVBF8Q,"I have to disagree with the other reviewer. But, everyone might have a different opinion, so there is no right or wrong here. Whatever suits your fitness level is the best for you. But I had a great time working out with Kimberly on this DVD...I would definitely recommend it!",1219363200,4,276,4.54
8234222,1,B000YVBF8Q,"I have bought a lot of exercise dvds lately.  I have to say this is the biggest let down.  Was expecting three high energy workouts. The first workout I only did half of the workout I got bored, and it's very low impact.  Second workout you need a special ball, and the third workout is a low impact dance workout. I used to do Kimberly Spreen workouts on exercisetv and enjoyed them that's why I was so dissappointed.",1207526400,4,418,4.333333333333333
