8192999,5,B000PR0JM2,"By pure dumb luck, we were able to watch this film on a cruise in 2012 because the ship's Danish captain knew that the 700+ Danish passengers aboard his ship would LOVE to see this 1967 comedy classic. And, boy, did they! Even if the captain's video did not have English subtitles, we still would have enjoyed the film's many slapstick scenes and extreme characters. A web search found this recap:

""A great cult comedy that was probably ahead of its time. A beloved movie among danish sailors. Martha is a very old and very rusty freight steamer, sailing in the Mediterranean, almost forgotten by its danish shipping line owner. The crew takes advantage of this, leading a very comfortable and luxurious life on board. Not without financial problems though. One day the ship's owner suddenly needs to sail on her. He is a very old school and disciplined person and certainly not satisfied with the state of the ship and the crew. But the crew shows their worth when they have to fight for the survival of their beloved old steamer."" Written by Peter Rasmussen

It's funny in the same way as Kelly's Heros.

And it was one of the most memorable things about our entire 13-day cruise. I would LOVE to get my hands on a copy!",1348358400,2,1223,4.575342465753424
