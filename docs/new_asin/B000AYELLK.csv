2398023,5,B000AYELLK,"From what I have read of the other reviews, a few of the people who wrote in have a few screws loose.  Wrestling is suppost to be fun and entertaining to watch.  Its a show for your enjoyment.  But a select few people seem to be having a hard time seperating the show from reality.  One guy below refered to the competition between TNA and WWE as ""a war"".  Another guy reverted back to childhood calling WWE fans stupid names.  What war are these idiots talking about?  No matter if your a WWE fan or TNA, or both like me, wrestling should be viewed as a fantastic form of entertainment...period.  And by the way...I wrestle on the independant scene, and all the guys involved in this sport are incredible atheletes and performers.  The Raven DVD rocks!",1125360000,6,753,4.477941176470588
2398024,5,B000AYELLK,"Raven has been my favorite wrestlers for years. I have been watching TNA for almost a year. Raven is truly one of the best in wresling. WWE doesnt know how to use true talent. October 1st Spike tv 11 pm watch it and then tell me that TNA sucks...though i will say the last good wwe ppv was NOT even in 2005...cena sucks....o back to Raven. This is a great collection of his greatest TNA moments up until '05. He just won the title, so expect Volume Two in a year or less!",1125187200,7,471,4.075268817204301

Please watch TNA than judge it.

Sacrifice was an execellent ppv that had a match that tooped any crap summerslam had to offer.

Please stick to writing messages like ''OMG OMG TEH CHIAN GANG RULZ!!!1111!!'' because this dvd is for actual wrestling fans.

Obviously you kid know very litle about wrestling. You obviously keep coming on amazon.com everyday hoping to win a ''war'' sad really.

People have lives, we love wrestling thats why we watch TNA. Please don't filth this place up by insulting something you have never seen.",1124755200,6,594,4.784313725490196
2398026,5,B000AYELLK,This DVD includes some of Raven's best matches in TNA and he also provides commentary on his matches with AJ Styles and Chris Harris. If you're a fan of Raven you'll love this DVD. I also recommend the Best of AJ Styles DVD which is phenomenal.,1124668800,4,244,4.326086956521739
2398027,5,B000AYELLK,"Raven's career has had highs and lows, in ECW he was the greatest he has ever been and won the title of quite a few occasions and was a great champion, he came to WCW, where he should have beaten Goldberg and came close to do soing on one or 2 occasions. He could have been on the complete top in WCW, but his career there suprisingly was better than his WWE tenure. In WWE, he had one of the best Wrestlemania forgotten matches for the Hardcore Championship against the Big Show and Kane on one of the best Wrestlemanias ever, X-7. Now in TNA, Raven is on top of the world, he is the NWA World Heavyweight Champion and the most well deserving champion they have had thus far, because he has bled, sweat, and done everything to give it his all every time he wrestles for the fans, Raven has and will forever be one of the reasons why I want to get into this business, and that says alot when your on my list with people like Bret Hart, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit. The character was always amazing, and the wrestler is unique, Raven is truly amazing, Quote the Raven Nevermore! Now buy this DVD and support TNA and Raven.",1124496000,2,1121,4.267605633802817
2398028,5,B000AYELLK,"Raven has made quite a name for himself via ECW fame (his legendary feud w/ Tommy Dreamer, barbed wire match w/ Sandman).  He is one of the great workers in the business and is passionate about the art of wrestling.  This 2 disc set is a great look at what Raven has been doing in TNA.  There are great matches with Jeff Jarrett, AJ Styles, D'lo Brown.  But what sticks out on these is the hardcore matches.  If you like bloody, hard hitting match there are plenty.  Matches with the Disciples of the New Church are brutal, one including Raven getting his head shaved, and so brutally, his scalp gets all cut up! Also are matches w/ Abyss and Vampiro, Sandman as well as the 1st time that Raven and Sabu faced each other in a singles match (so TNA claimed).  Also included are a couple of matches where Raven gives commentary on.

This is a great set, with a little bit for everyone.  There will be more coming from Raven, who recently won the NWA World Title.  See TNA Impact this October on Spike TV, or check out TNA's site ([...]) for details.",1124496000,4,1047,4.350515463917525

2398040,5,B000AYELLK,"TNA ""Best of"" DVD's seem to be broken in two categories...Nashville TN, TNA and Orlando, FL TNA.  Nevermore: The Best of Raven has some of Raven's best matches from the Nashville, TN TNA era.  This 2-disc collection is really good and any fan of Raven, TNA, ECW will enjoy this collection.  I rated this collection 5 stars because the matches are great, truly some of Raven's best work from the Asylum.  Best match would have to be Raven vs. Sabu.  My only problem is this is not the ""Best of"" Raven by any means.  I would of liked for TNA to hold off on putting this DVD together because I feel it was too early for a ""Best of"" Raven series.  He wasn't with the company for even 2 years by the date of the most recent match on this collection.  Too early for a ""Best of"" series.  TNA should of waited and included Orlando, FL TNA matches like Raven vs. DDP, Raven vs. Sean Waltman (House of Fun) and Raven's NWA title win at Slammiversary and some of his title defenses.

Overall this is a fantastic DVD showcasing one of the more interesting characters in professional wrestling.  Any hardcore wrestling fan will truly enjoy.  Pick this up.",1148860800,3,1142,4.4375
2398041,5,B000AYELLK,all im going to say is any ECW or raven fans should pick this bad boy up,1145404800,3,72,3.2941176470588234
2398042,4,B000AYELLK,"Raven was yet another wasted WWE wrestler and in TNA he's a big star and here's some of his best matches. In the WWE they could've made him the next Mick Foley. He's hardcore and he can actually wrestle, you can't really say that much about Foley. I mean when was the last time you saw Foley do the ankle lock ? In the WWE, they probably wouldn't even have been able to release a best of Raven dvd because he was used poorly.

  This dvd is full of some of his best matches in TNA. He takes on The Sandman, A.J. Styles, Vampiro ""which could've been a better feud than it was""  Jeff Jarrett,  Abyss and  Sabu to name a few. They need another Raven dvd though because he had a lot other really good matches after the dvd was released. He had a good cage match with Jeff Hardy, a Raven's rules match with Sean Waltman, his World title win, his successful defenses over Abyss and Rhyno and his title loss to Jeff Jarrett in Canada. He also has had recent matches with Justin Credible and Chris Kanyon, although they went under different names in those matches. Those matches weren't really his best though. Raven lost a career ending match at the last ppv though because Larry Z. has something against him...I have no idea what. I just hope Raven is brought back soon and that he kicks Larry's ass though in some sort of violent match lol.",1138233600,8,1335,4.32
2398043,5,B000AYELLK,"You gotta hand it to Raven when it comes to being creative and seeing beyond what a wrestling match should be. It's not Raven's best, i.e. breaking fingers or anything like that, but there are quite a few classics on this dvd set. Check it out. Later.",1136160000,2,251,4.361702127659575
2398044,4,B000AYELLK,"This DVD is set up from the early days of TNA (Nashville with the regular ring) to just right after they got the six sided ring before the move to Orlando.  This is a good DVD for TNA fans but the only complaint I have here are that they have matches that would look good on paper but were just kinda ""bleh"" when they actually happened in the ring.  But this DVD in the end gives you a nice mix of hardcore brawls & wrestling.

Raven's TNA debut - Just shows Raven attacking Jeff Jarrett after being released by WWE.

vs. Sandman (Clockwork Orange House Of Fun Match w/special referee Kevin Sullivan) - Tons of weapons were hanging around the ring and the way to win was the knock your opponett off the balcony through some tables.  This match looks good on paper but wasn't anything special since they've had tons of better matches in ECW & even WCW.  Just your typical hitting each other with weapons & fighting through the crowd before the eventual finish happens.  Raven bleeds buckets.

vs. AJ Styles (Ladder Match) - It was more like a hardcore match involving a ladder than the type of ladder matches you would see in WWE.  Also AJ wasn't doing his ""high spots"" stuff during this match so it was interesting.  Better than the Sandman match.

vs. Jeff Jarrett (NWA title match) - This is one of the best matches on this disc.  Great mix of wrestling, brawling, tons of outside interfearence.  5 star match for me.

vs. Shane Douglas (Hair vs. Hair) - Typical brawl, nothing really special during the match except for when Douglas vomits during the match.  After the match though, Raven gets SCALPED by James Mitchell (who was holding the clippers the wrong way) to the point to where his head was bleeding & you can see the pain on Raven's face.

vs. Vampiro (Gallows of Retribution Match) - This was a match to where you had a dog collar in each corner & you had to hook them all on your opponents neck & beat them down.  Again, looks good on paper but the match wasn't anything special.

vs. Father James Mitchell (Last Man Standing) - Basically a squash match only put on here to follow his fued against The New Church group.

vs. Abyss - Average match but enjoyable.

vs. Ron Killings vs. AJ Styles vs. Abyss (Sting is the special outside enforcer) - Nice four way brawl with Sting even getting involved in some of the action.

vs. Chris Harris vs. Ron Killings vs. AJ Styles (NWA title match/Deadly Draw Match) - If a decision isn't made after 5 mins., a new contender comes into the match.  Another good four way dance match.

vs. Sonjay Dutt - Another squash match only to follow the fued between him & Sabu.

vs. Sabu - They went back to the ECW days with this hardcore match.  Alongside with the Jarrett match, this was another one of the best matches on this DVD.  Another 5 star match for me.

Bonus Section: Both of these matches have commentary by Raven & Terry Taylor.  The commentary was real good since you hear him talk about his storytelling during each match along with his DEEP knowledge of the wrestling business.

vs. Chris Harris - Good wrestling match.

vs. AJ Styles - Good clash of styles and is another good match.  The commentary is really interesting on this match.

Overall, the DVD has a good mix of hardcore matches, brawls & actual wrestling...aside from the squash matches.  When you thinking about getting a TNA DVD, this should be one of the ones at the top of the list.",1135900800,22,3412,4.46925566343042
2398045,3,B000AYELLK,"The famous Edgar Allen Poe quote has served as Raven's trademark for many years. Ironically, Raven's legacy in TNA Wrestling may mirror that of the writer, as he spirals into madness in his quest to achieve his self-described ""destiny"" to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion.

2398046,4,B000AYELLK,"This is a 2 disc set of matches for Scott Levy (Raven) from his stint with NWA/TNA wrestling.  The compilation is hosted by TNA's Don West and Mike Tenay.  They give a short introduction at the beginning of each disc about the upcoming matches.
The following are my ratings of the matches based out of 5 *****:

Disc One:
1) Raven's TNA Debut - The immediate ending of the Jeff Jarrett/Chris Daniels match is shown as Jeff is celebrating his victory over Daniels in the ring with the other TNA wrestlers.  Raven storms into the ring, attacks Jarrett and takes his Championship belt from him setting the stage for Raven's quest for the NWA Championship.

2) vs. Sandman - A ""Clockwork Orange, House Of Fun Match"" with Kevin Sullivan as ""Special Enforcer"". The ring is surrounded with steel chains, chairs, a steel gate, trashcans and assorted weapons.  The winner is the first one to toss the other off of the ""Raven's Nest"" onto three stacked tables below. Needless to say, this match is bloody and violent. Both men take multiple heavy hits and bleed alot. At the end of the match, Raven calls out Jeff Jarrett, who runs into the ring and attacks a bloody/weak Raven. Check the ending. Rating - ****1/2 (for the beeting and bumps Sandman takes) (8 1/2min)

3) vs. AJ Styles - Ladder Match. The first one to get the suspended Championship Match contract wins. Raven bleeds rivers. AJ top-rope leg drops Raven through a table! Raven staple guns AJ's head! Disco Inferno interferes and power slams AJ over the top rope and through a table! Was it enough for Raven?
Rating - ***** (11 1/2min)

4) vs Jeff Jarrett(C) - NWA Championship Match. Raven has Julio and Alexis (The Gathering) outside the ring. Raven bleeds a ton. This was a pure brawl with old-school wrestling. Jarrett
top-rope elbow-drops Raven through a table! There was alot of outside interfence from the Gathering and other wrestlers. Jarrett takes a real pounding! Got to give it to Jeff on this one. Rating - ****1/2  (17min)

5) vs Shane Douglas - Hair vs Hair match. The loser gets his head shaved. Raven gets the audience directly involved in the match as he and Shane battle outside the ring. Raven has a couple of audience members hold chairs for him as he slams Shane's head into the chairs. Shane vomits a couple of times during the match! Shane is noticeably injured as he holds his  limp right forearm. Both men bleed alot. Raven top-rope DDTs Shane through a table! There is outside interference in this match also, as ""The Deciples Of The New Church"" and ""The Gathering"" brawl. Check the ending. Rating - **** (for the fortitude and endurance Shane displays)  (14min)

6) vs Vampiro w/James Mitchell - Four Corners Dog Collar Match. The first one to get hung and submits loses. Once again, both wrestlers bleed big time. Raven lands a top-rope inverted DDT through a table on Vampiro! This match is very brutal. A pure brawl. Rating  - ****  (12min)

7) vs James Mitchell - This is James' first wrestling match and it is a total squash! James bleeds alot (watch Raven help James ""color"" himself).  Don't know why this is on here.  Rating - **  (5min)

8) vs Abyss - Abyss lands a torture rack/drop down on Raven. See Abyss fumble around with a table in the ring as he tries to set it up in a corner. Raven has to set it up for him, and then he gets speared through it! Check the ending as outside interference again disrupts the match. Rating - *** (11min)

Disc Two:
1) vs AJ Styles vs Ron Killings vs Abyss - A fourway brawl with Sting as ""Special Enforcer"". This match has alot of aerial moves. Watch AJ and Ron land a double over the top-rope flip-dive onto Raven and Abyss! See Killings land a top-rope ax-kick onto AJ's head while AJ has a chair laid on his head! This match is non-stop action! A bit too short!  Rating - ***1/2
(11min 15sec)

2) vs AJ Styles(C) vs Ron Killings vs Chris Harris - NWA Deadly Draw Championship Match. AJ has to take on 3 wrestlers spaced 5 minutes apart. After 5 minutes if there is no pin or submission, the next wrestler enters the ring. If a pinfall or submission occurs within the 5 minutes, a new champion is crowned, the loser leaves and the next wrestler comes in and wrestles the new champion. AJ fist takes on Chris Harris. This is my favorite match on the disc. Non-stop action! AJ puts on a real show! AWSOME BABY! This is stuff WWE WISHES they could come up with! Rating - ***** (22min)

3) vs  Sonjay Dutt - No DQ match. A pure squash. Ravens is trying to get to Sabu and he has to go through Sonjay to get to him. Raven turns heel. Rating - *1/2 (for Sabu sighting) (5min)

4) vs Sabu - Their first ever match against each other! Raven once again has to bleed like a stuck pig. This match has everything you expect from Sabu - tables, chairs, aerial moves and pure insanity! This match was a decade + in the making, but it needed to be alot longer! Short but too the point! Rating - ****1/2 (12min)
BONUS MATCHES:
With commentary by Raven and Terry Taylor
1) vs Chris Harris - Their first solo match together. A fantastic match. Raven thinks it's Chris Harris' best match. It very well might be! Great match! Rating - ***** (20min)

2) vs AJ Styles - My 2nd favorite match on the disc. A great wretsling match with submission holds, counter moves and acrobatics galore! I think it's Raven's best wrestling match ever. Rating - *****  (16min)

The only drawbacks with this DVD is that there are no dates for the matches! Come on TNA, what's up with that? Also, there is no biography of Raven and there are no interviews or match thoughts with Raven.  You get the matches with some pre-match info. but not a whole lot of background on Raven. It would have been better if Raven gave some insight on his career and the matches.
Overall,it's worth the money.",1129593600,15,5781,4.493791786055397

Then TNA took me by sureprize with AJ Styles, and Raven still can work a good match I was watching him VS Rhino on PPV real good match. TNA is nothing but hard working wrestlers. There smart there taking the WWE stars that can still put on a good match, and I love the X-DIVision. The story line thing is played it's time for Action and TNA is all that. The WWE is so weak
there giving there belts to anyone and saying he has a belt let's call him a superstar. The new so call stars can't sell out like the old stars can. The new stars can't sell a DVD
that's why there making so many old school wrestler DVD's. Warrior, l.o.d., Jake the snake, Best of the 80's, The best of Undertaker. But the one I can't wait for is the Bret Hart Story due in late November that's price less. But for now TNA is the best wrestling on DVD and sat. on Spike TV. Raven Nevermore!

2398056,5,B000AYELLK,"This DVD showcases Raven at his best in TNA before he finally won the NWA World Title from AJ Styles a few months ago. I highly recommend this DVD and all of TNA's other DVD's as well as checking out their debut on SPIKE TV on Saturday, October 1st 11PM EST/10PM CT. This is the alternative that wrestling fans have been longing for since March 26th of 2001 when WWE(then WWF)became the lone major pro wrestling company in the U.S. after the unfortunate deaths of WCW and ECW. I've been a hardcore fan of the wrestling business for over 20 years and I must say that we(the wrestling fans)in addition to the wrestlers NEED for TNA to be very successful for the overall health of the business. Fans want to see great, compelling wrestling programming and after watching what's happened to WWE over the past 4+ years I think it's become painfully obvious that they are at their best when they have COMPETITION. Actually, they're truly at their best when they're the number 2 company looking up at another company that they can't seem to overcome as we saw for 83 weeks thanks to WCW Monday Nitro's winning streak over WWE Raw years ago. WWE was hungry and gave us great TV! Now, you never know what kind of show you're going to get from WWE. I'm not saying that they don't have good/great shows, but I am saying that they're not consistant anymore. TNA could provide WWE with that much needed competition that's been missing while also delivering some great TV for the fans! Also, the wrestlers need another option because WWE isn't for everyone. Thanks to TNA since June of 2002 we've seen great talent like AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels, Ron ""The Truth"" Killings(how much better has he been since joining TNA compared to his WWE stint? 2 time NWA World Champion!), Chris Sabin, Petey Williams, Amazing Red, Low Ki, Kazarian(who should be returning soon), Matt Bentley a.k.a. Michael Shane(who decided to stay), etc. Also, wrestlers who are no longer with WWE may be better off in TNA such as Team 3-D(Bubba Ray & D-Von Dudley), Charlie Haas, Matt Hardy(Oops! Matt went back to WWE, might not have been the best move Matt, let's see how he fares in tomorrow night's cage match against Edge at Unforgiven),etc. Now I'm not saying that TNA is without it's flaws. That brings me back to the fact that Raven is a ""former"" NWA World Champion. He lost the title on Sept. 15th at a Border City Wrestling ""house show"" in Windsor, Ontario CANADA to.... Jeff Jarrett?!! Once again the title has been put on Jarrett. He'll be the first Champ that fans see on Oct. 1st. Well, TNA has made mistakes before and eventually they seemed to learn from them. Maybe one of these days they'll realize that the only people who believe Jarrett is a main eventer are his family members and his friends(Vince Russo, who gave him his first World Title in WCW in 2000). But overall, the fact remains that TNA's product has greatly improved over the past 3+ years. So the future looks promising. They just need exposure, to learn from past mistakes(Jarrett is a BIG one!)and to be focused on delivering a great product. I hope you've enjoyed my comments, if so check me out on a free wrestling hotline called the Ringside Report (847)604-3769 and please let me know what you think.

8080866,3,B000AYELLK,"After a long career spanning from WCW and WWE in the early '90's, to ECW and WCW in the mid to late '90s and a not so blockbuster run in WWE til the very beginning of 2003 (mainly do to politics in my opinion), Scott Levy the man known to wrestling fans as Raven made his shocking debut in TNA attacking the Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett. Since then he has had some classic and violent encounters and this DVD shows some of his best from the early portion of his TNA run.

-1/22/03, Raven's Debut: Right after winning a hard fought match, Jarrett gets attacked during an in-ring interview by Raven who hits his Evenflow DDT and steals the title belt leaving through the crowd. Good debut.

-3/6/03, Clockwork Orange House of Fun Match, vs. Sandman, Special Enforcer Kevin Sullivan: Basically another name for a hardcore match where everything is legal and the only way to win is to take your opponent up to Raven's Perch in the stands and throw them through two tables. Its a pretty good match, lots of weapon usage, tables, chairs and Raven bleeds pretty good. Sullivan more or less encourages the violence as he hands both men chairs or whatever throughout the contest, Raven hits a nice diving elbow off the top driving Sandman through a table. Eventually they fight through the crowd, up to stands and Sandman goes through a bunch of tables so Raven wins. 7/10. Nice post match where Raven calls out Jeff Jarrett who beats on him for a bit, then AJ Styles comes in to join the action.

-3/20/03, Hardcore Ladder Match, vs. AJ Styles: Starts out hot with Styles slamming a trash can into the head of Raven, then a springboard moonsault by AJ driving him into the ladder. Raven tosses a chair at Styles to send him off the ladder, then uses the ladder in an airplane spin knocking AJ down, Raven bleeds badly in this one. There's more good weapon shots, especially from both using a trash can lid, a staple gun and of course the ladder, nice spot though where AJ nails a diving leg drop onto Raven and the referee sending both through the table. Glen Gilberti (WCW's Disco Inferno) interferes powerbombing Styles through a table on the outside, allowing Raven to climb the ladder and grab the contract to fight for the heavyweight title. 7/10. It does appear to be slightly clipped though.

-4/30/03, NWA Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Jeff Jarrett (Champion): The most hyped match in the first year of TNA that had been built for roughly 3 months since Raven debuted in shocking fashion attacking Jarrett after he successfully defended his title. The crowd was way hot and there was tons of brawling, both men bled, nice spot where Jeff nails an elbow off the second rope driving Raven through a table. There was interference from various guys like Raven's Gathering, The Sports Entertainment Xtreme, Extreme Revolution (aka former ECW stars). Jarrett gets handcuffed, Raven goes to hit him with a chair, the lights go out and Sabu hits Raven with a chair then a senton onto the Revolution members on the outside. Raven misses a chair shot, Jeff covers for two, then gets uncuffed, he ends up hitting the Stroke and covers to win. 8/10, just a bit too much interference for me to rate it higher. Side Note: Wrestling fans will recognize the woman with Raven as Mickie James.

-9/17/03, Hair vs. Hair Match, vs. Shane Douglas: This was the infamous contest that featured some good brawling, they went into the crowd, some weapons were used like a chair and a steel chain, there was a little wrestling in there and the expected intereference from members of the New Church on Douglas' behalf, who put a table in the ring. The Gathering come in and clear the ring, Shane puts the table up, gets the DDT but kicks out at 2, Raven tries for a superplex, gets sent through the table but kicks out. Raven does hit a DDT off the top rope through a table but before the 3 count the lights go out, then Vampiro of all people is in the ring, hits a DDT on Raven allowing Shane to cover and win. 7/10, the bloody scalping of Raven is included, which is pretty graphic. Side Note: One disgusting moment took place during the match as Douglas was literally puking in the ring, perhaps from past substance issues he's had.

-10/29/03, Gallows of Retribution Match, vs. Vampiro w/James Mitchell: Always been a fan of Vampiro, the object of this match is to hang your opponent from one of the dog collar chains attached to the ropes and you win when they are hung and can't continue. This is an expected violent match, chairs are used, Mitchell interferes to give Vampiro the advantage and he's busted open. Nice spin kick by Vampiro off the top, uses the chain around his head then headbutts Raven, hangs him from a chain but Raven fights out. Nice exchanges in the closing minutes, Raven hits a sloppy looking DDT off the top through a table, puts a collar on Vampiro then hangs him and he gives up. 5/10, cause its a bit clipped and kinda sloppy in spots.

-11/5/03, Last Man Standing Match, vs. ""Father"" James Mitchell: After being brutalized and humiliated by Mitchell and his New Church, we have Raven's revenge here, where Raven beats up James around the ring slamming him into the steel steps busting him open. Raven uses a chain, a chair, Mitchell hit a lowblow and the weapons a few times, then slaps Raven, who comes up angry hitting some quick clotheslines, the Raven Effect and covers for three and Mitchell can't answer the 10 count so Raven wins. He then hangs James from a chain as blood pours out of his head. 3/10, as it was more of a segment.

-vs. Abyss: Raven takes some punishment here and also dishes out some good offense using Abyss' size against him, however Abyss sends Raven crashing into the guardrail then continues his beatdown. It goes into the crowd where Abyss uses a chair a few times, back in the ring he sets up a table in the corner. Raven tries for a comeback but gets Shock Treatment just for two, then a bit later Abyss hits a spear drilling Raven through the table, but Raven kicks out somehow. He hits the Raven Effect but some security members interfere on Abyss' behalf, Abyss locks on the bearhug, Raven then fights off the security guards which leads to a DQ. 5/10. The Gathering comes out to even the odds, the brawl continues between Raven and Abyss with the monster taking a big chair shot.

-No DQ Four Way Match, vs. AJ Styles vs. Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. Abyss, Special Enforcer Sting: Its a match to determine a contender to face the number one contender Chris Harris for a title shot (guess that makes sense) and this was a match full of quick offense with some good face offs between the four. Nice double teaming by Truth and AJ, Abyss hits a nice double back suplex on both men, Raven takes a swing at Sting who fires back beating him up, Raven and Abyss bring Sting in the ring then hits a double clothesline knocking both out of the ring. Great double flip dive by Truth and AJ to the outside, back in the ring each man breaks up the pinfall, Truth hits an axe kick slamming Styles head onto a chair. Great closing moments, we have the Styles Clash on Raven but Jeff Jarrett interferes and distracts AJ long enough to allow the Raven Effect to be hit and the cover for three so Raven wins. 7/10.

-Four Way Gauntlet Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship, vs. AJ Styles (Champion) vs. Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. Chris Harris: If you get pinned anytime during this match you're eliminated, tt starts out with Harris vs. Styles for the first 5 minutes, Harris takes it to AJ early on hitting a nice delayed vertical suplex only for two. Raven comes out next and hits some quick moves on Chris, including a running bulldog, he blocks the Styles Clash by AJ running him into the corner. Nice double sleeper hold spot, with Harris having one on Raven who has one on AJ. A couple minutes later Truth comes down and hits a nice spinning forearm onto Harris, AJ hits a nice Shooting Star Press off the top to the outside on all three guys. Loved the exchange between AJ and Truth with Styles finally hitting a big kick, Chris applies a Sharpshooter on Truth while AJ uses the Funk Spinning Toe Hold on Raven. Loved the close nearfalls at the close of the match, Jeff Jarrett comes down hits the guitar shot on Styles, Raven hits the Raven Effect for two, Harris hits a diving elbow on AJ only for two, Truth hits a top rope axe kick on Styles and covers to win the title. 7/10.

-Raven's Rules Match, Raven vs. Sonjay Dutt: This was about putting over the story of Raven wanting to face Sabu with Sabu refusing to, Sonjay gets beat up initially around the ring but he does hit some nice kicks before getting powerbombed out of the corner then pulls him up before the three count. He duct tapes Dutt's hands then uses a screwdriver on his head, all while he keeps asking on the mic where Sabu is. The referee quick counts to stop this madness, 3/10. Raven keeps hammering Sonjay, duct tapes his feet then slams the mic into his head, finally Sabu comes out to face off with Raven but even after a few slaps Sabu won't strike back. Dusty Rhodes comes out and gets in Raven's face and Raven leaves.

-8/11/04, Raven vs. Sabu: After vowing never to fight Raven for years, the tension and violence became too much as Sabu finally faced off with Raven, strangely though this is the opening match when the build up warranted the main event slot. Each man comes out dressed as the other and this is a pretty intense match, Sabu hits a dive to the outside sending Raven into the guardrail. Its really just a wild brawl which is expected, lots of weapon usage, Sabu grabs a spike and drills Raven with it busting him open however Sabu goes through a table on the outside and appears to hurt his left knee. Raven targets the throat and head of Sabu with a chair and even locks on Sabu's Camel Clutch, then the drop toe hold into the chair twice.

Sabu comes back with chair shots, leg drops, the camel clutch but Raven doesn't stay down, Raven hits some moves but gets the Arabian Facebuster on Raven off the top rope onto a chair. Sabu then hits a springboard leg drop through a table but just for two, Raven tries using the ropes to get the three but the referee catches him, Sabu shockingly kicks out of the Raven Effect DDT. A bit later Raven hits another Raven Effect through a table and covers Sabu for three. 8/10.

Bonus Matches featuring Special Commentary by Terry Taylor & Raven

-Raven's Rules Match, vs. Chris Harris: Right after winning the four way, we have this contest where Harris had his left arm taped up and Raven did focus on the injury throughout the match. Chris did show a lot of heart as he kept fighting back even hammering on the knee trapping it in the second rope then slamming it in the guardrail. There's interference from Sabu and James Storm who fight into the crowd, Raven attempts the Raven Effect but gets rolled up for three. 7/10.

-NWA Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. AJ Styles (Champion): After not getting his shot at Jarrett for the title, Raven faces AJ in this pretty good match, Styles displays some aggression going after Raven's knee, then sends him into the guardrail and works on the leg some more. Raven does counter some of AJ's high flying moves and grounds him for a bit, targeting the shoulder after AJ crashed on the outside from a splash. There's some good submission moves by both guys, AJ comes back, nice spot where Styles throws powder into Raven's eyes while he gets the superkick. The referee gets taken out, so he can't count AJ down for three, someone comes out dressed as La Parka and DDT's Raven, AJ hits the Styles Clash and covers for three. 8/10, La Parka takes off his mask to reveal he's Chris Harris, then James Storm and a bunch of guys come down and brawl a bit.

While it is nice to see Raven in his best environment the hardcore fray, some of these contests are available on other DVDS and other than the special audio tracks on the two bonus matches there's no comments from Raven himself during the 3 hour feature presentation. The Dutt & Mitchell matches weren't really worth putting on here, the Vampiro one while decent was sloppy at times, as was the Abyss match on here. So if you're a Raven fan then pick it up but honestly its a mixed bag of matches, where while some are good once you watch them once you likely won't watch them again.",1346284800,,12578,4.517574692442882

4. Hair vs Hair Raven vs Shane Douglas
  The match isn't to much to see just basic brawling inside the ring then with the fans when we get back the match is still not to much and then shane vomits in the ring which isn't that gross but if your eating can be nasty but it isn't the sickest part as afterward raven is scalped by jim mitchell 7/10

5. Hangmans Horror Raven vs Vampiro
  The match is pretty good with both getting cut open and the hanging of each other leads to a little suspense the match doesn't get old after watching it a few times I think it stays fresh 7.75/10

6. Last Man Standing Raven vs Mitchell
  Total squash but fun to watch him give mitchell a little color 2/10

7. Raven vs Abyss

8. Raven vs Aj Styles vs Abyss vs Ron Killings
  This is a pretty good four way match and when I first saw it the who wins shocked me Sting was the enforcer for this one and does some things first but seems to just fade from the match soon but the action is really solid 8.75/10

9. Deadly Draw NWA Title Raven vs Aj Styles vs Ron Killings vs Chris Harris
  The rules are that there are two five min rounds and if they don't have a fall the next comes out and the number of people is raised the action is better than the last and the match is perfect but i don't like the winner 10/10

10. Raven vs Sonjay Dutt
  Squash and worse than the last but to advance in the story of him and sabu 1.25/10

11. Raven vs Sabu
  This match rules the wepons are used right and the match moves along perfectly but shouldn't have been an opener but a main event the match is great two legends going at it what is not to like or love 10/10

The next two matches Raven and Terry Taylor do the commentary which is just great

12. Bonus Raven vs Chris Harris
  Chris Harris puts on a great match but of course he is with raven but no really this match is just great you will never seen such great wrestling out of Chris unless you are watching this match 9.25/10
