8051314,5,B0007TKGG2,"SON OF INGAGI (1940) is a rare horror film. One of the films by Zack Williams, a black film artist who made films with an all black cast, for the black audiences. (This was in the days before Denzel washington, Sidney Portier, James Earl Jones, the days you never saw a black man in the heroic lead in a film.) The real treat of the movie is the nasty old witch that lives in a little house. All she has to do is bang a low-toned gong and the big giant, who sleeps on hay, wakes up and beats the old woman's enemies to a frazzle. A rare piece of film history, and a lot of fun.",1524787200,,577,3.9401709401709404

Great scene where the monster steals his sandwich - TWICE -  Also you get to hear a rare clip of The Four Toppers. Not a great plot, but worth the watch!!",1510790400,,328,4.360655737704918
