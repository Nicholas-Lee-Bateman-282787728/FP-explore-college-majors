7965157,4,B0000694VH,"Well season tree on Lexx was my favorite.  The whole story about heaven and hell was imaginative at worst.  As it began to wrap up, the story takes us to Girl Town where we see a parody of ruling by commitee and burocrats.  It is very clever and at times side splitting funny.  The we move to purgatory on The Beach where stan has his judgement day.  IT is the least entertaining episode of the season but it is nessasary to the unravel the upcomming Heavev and Hell,  the season finally.  This climax is great as it puts the Lexx crew in their worst scenario ever and fortunately pulls them out in time to throw them one final ball buster before the credits roll.  A great show and a great run down the strech to a gripping final scene.  have fun.",1025136000,5,748,4.24822695035461
