3136764,5,B00150MENK,"I had seen Dr. Harper's ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" and found it extremely helpful in dealing with newborns to help them calm down when crying and to sleep better. All his suggestions and techniques I found to be very effective. With ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block"", Dr. Harper is also very good in giving ideas to deal with toddlers who are having problems communicating their feelings and desires and do so throwing tantrums. Dr. Harper offers very helpful techniques to understand the little ones and help them be happier by having the adults around them respond in manners that are more appropriate to their developmental level. I haven't yet tried the techniques but I sent a copy to my son who has a two year old daughter. I'm waiting to hear from him to see what he thinks. The parents who participated in both videos appeared to have learned the techniques and found them very helpful.",1220140800,,902,4.679245283018868

3136767,1,B00150MENK,"I bought this dvd in hopes to help us with foster children that come to us with lots of temper tantrums. I have raised my own children and remember how stressful tantrums can be on us and our children. After watching this video, I was utterly disappointed in Dr. Karp's approach. I agree we should let our children know that they have been heard and we understand what they want, but to mimic what they are doing doesn't seem like being a very good role model to teach them how to handle these emotions they are experiencing. I think it encourages them to react with tantrums whenever they experience their frustrations and anger with a situation. We need to model how we handle these feelings and how we expect them to handle them. Not join in and encourage the unwanted behavior.",1324080000,6,781,4.546099290780142
3136768,4,B00150MENK,"My husband and I loved the ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" so we're hoping ""Happiest Toddler on the Block"" works just as well! We just watched it today so we'll see. Only thing about the DVD is the annoying song the guy sings at the beginning and end so it's inevitable you're going to listen to it! LoL",1309305600,,300,4.189655172413793

3136771,5,B00150MENK,"Harvey Karp, M.D.'s methods seem based on empathy. He teaches parents to quickly identify their child's negative emotions or demands. Once you understand what your child wants you can then act in a way that gets their full attention. Basically by sympathizing with your child you can get on their level and talk to them in their ""caveman"" language. This is a playful and fun way of interacting that may take some practice.

The parents featured in this DVD have had great success with the methods. By watching this DVD you can see the methods in action. Children who are upset are quickly calmed. So if you have children who are throwing tantrums or go as far as to have scary breath-holding spells then the methods presented here will make your family life much more peaceful. The information on this DVD will help you teach your child patience and how to be respectful. With this method there will no longer be the need to shout or spank.

Dr. Karp has explained so perfectly how the toddler mind works.  I have used many of the techniques with my own child as well as the sick children at the hospital I work at. I have had much success and see a really opportunity for building a great relationship with children using these techniques.  I have been very impressed and empowered in my communication with them.

The dvd covers only the first few chapters in the book.  And of course the chapters I still need to read are NOT covered in the dvd (big bummer for me).

However I am a huge fan of Dr. Karp.  His baby dvd was a life saver for us with our first baby and we've used all the methods with our new baby.  His toddler philosophy makes TOTAL sense.  We've used it a few times with our daughter and it does seem to work.  I would suggest you get both the book and the dvd.

I gave this only 4 stars because it didn't cover EVERYTHING in the book.",1252713600,9,713,3.8958333333333335

When I saw that Dr. Karp did a Happiest Toddler on the Block DVD I had to buy it.  I was not as happy with the content in this DVD and I felt that some of the toddler work was ridiculous.  I would have preferred it if his approaches were tailored to the personality of the toddler you are raising.  My little boy does respond to the exercise of crying with him and repeating what he is trying to say however none of the others.  He just looks at me like I am nutty.  I am giving it three stars because one of the exercises did work and I like the 5 S's in HBOB.",1357171200,,689,3.75
