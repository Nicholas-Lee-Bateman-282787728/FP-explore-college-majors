2642610,5,B000HT3PEM,4 seasons later and this show is still as great as it was in the pilot! The cast & crew have become a family and it truely reflects on screen.  The storylines & acting have become first class and this show is destined to become a TV Land classic!,1164067200,11,246,4.020408163265306
2642611,3,B000HT3PEM,"I love this show. It is one of the only 2 sitcoms on television that I can actually watch.

This DVD set however, was a big dissappointment.

The packaging is smaller than the sets for the first 3 seasons (which totally ruins the prettiness of my shelf), and there are NO extras on this set at all. . . . which was really annoying.

Worth the purchase if you're a huge fan of the show though. This is quality television =)",1164067200,5,422,4.185185185185185
2642612,5,B000HT3PEM,"The series just gets better with age.  Each actor has become their characters completely and can do pretty much anything with them and make it funny!  This season has some of my favorite episodes and is the last until the sixth season that features Scarlett Pomers as Kyra.  Reba is back on the CW November 19th 8/7c so tune in!!!  Buy Season Four if you love great comedy!  As someone (can't remember who, but they're a well-known critic, trust me!) it's one of the last great comedies on TV.",1162857600,7,493,4.49438202247191
2642613,5,B000HT3PEM,"Reba is a great comedy that can put anyone in a great mood! With all the amazing characters in the show, I can't decide who is better...Reba, Brock, the amazing Barbara Jean, and who can forget Van. I don't think there is a t.v. show out there with the personalities of Van and Barbara Jean. Reba is appealing to all ages. The adult side with Reba. The typical guy side with Brock. The blonde bubbly side with Barbara Jean. Of course the teenage angst that is Van, Cheyanne, and Kyra. And of course little Jake. I don't know about you but I can't wait for more seasons to come.",1158969600,13,577,4.302752293577981

2642712,5,B000HT3PEM,"Take a famous female country music singer and give her a sitcom.  I would have said it was a recipe for disaster, but Reba proved me wrong.  Season after season, this show never failed to make me laugh, and pulling out season 4 on DVD again reminded me why.

Season 4 picks up where season 3 left off - Brock (Christopher Rich) has just confessed to his ex-wife Reba (Reba McEntire) that he made a mistake when he divorced her to marry his pregnant girlfriend Barbara Jean (Melissa Peterman).  The problems in their marriage grow so intense that Barbara Jean kicks Brock out.  No, he doesn't go back to Reba (and I'm glad about that), but they do spend quite a bit of the season trying to work things out.  Of the kids, this hits Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) the hardest since she's still living with Barbara Jean and trying to pick up the pieces.

In other developments this season, Reba become a realtor, daughter Cheyenne (JoAnna Garcia) continues with her schooling to become a dentist, son-in-law Van (Steve Howey) gets traded to the Denver arena football team before seeing his career ended by a rare spinal condition, and Jake (Mitch Hollerman) goes out for football as well.

While every episode has plenty of laughs (this is a sitcom after all), a few of them really stand out.  For example, the one where they throw a surprise party for Van only to have him drop a bombshell is a riot.  Another great one involves Barbara Jean's missing dog (also named Brock) and who might have hurt it.  The show is always walking a fine line between the comedy and some of the more serious issues they deal with, and that is most true in the seasons finale, which involves someone realizing they are an alcoholic.  And while they do get serious at the end, the show features some more truly gut busting laughs.

I have usually found that the longer a show lasts, the better the acting from the main cast gets, and that holds true here.  These actors know the characters and are able to tap into that to truly show us what the character are feeling.  Yet, since this is a sitcom, the comic timing is also important, and the cast has that as well.  Yes, even Reba.  She is a gifted comedian as well as a gifted singer.  I have to also praise Steve Howey whose comic timing and facial expressions are absolutely priceless.  Just his reactions can often bring down the house.  On the guest star front, watch for an episode that features Reba's friend Dolly Parton.

Season 4 marked a shift in the release of the show on DVD.  While the previous seasons had extras, there are none to be found here (or on the last two releases).  But since for a while it was iffy that we'd even get the season at all on DVD, I'll take what I can get.  The set includes all 22 episodes on three double sided discs.  They are in their native full frame and stereo sound and look and sound great.

While the show does tackle some serious issues, it never forgets to make us laugh.  And that's why season 4 of Reba is another winner.",1433376000,,2998,4.43327239488117

2642849,4,B000HT3PEM,"This is an especially touching season.  They deal with several real-life situations with more delicacy and kindness than at the beginning of the series, and I think that is a good thing.  Van and Shiane (sp?) continue to grow up and become better people, but not without real-life difficulties.  Very entertaining!",1187136000,,314,5.117647058823529

Description:

It takes a lot of heart to keep a family like this one together. Country music superstar Reba McEntire is back as Reba Hart, and as always, keeping the peace in her household is one hilarious challenge after another. Amid Brock and Barbara Jean's marital troubles, Cheyenne's personal struggles, Van's career crisis, and Kyra's growing pains, Reba somehow manages to keep the whole family functioning at a level just above dysfunctional. A little love, it turns out, goes a long way. Vibrant, touching, and laugh-out-loud funny, Season Four of Reba has it all!",1181174400,,716,4.860655737704918
2642853,5,B000HT3PEM,"Reba is a wonderful show which aired for six years, 5 on the WB and then the last shortened season by the stupid CW.  The fourth season of the show continued in the great and funny tradition of the first three seasons.  There are many great episodes in this season, but one of my favorites is the ""Pageant of Grandmas"" in which Reba and Barbra Jean fight over who will be in a beauty pageant at Jakes school!  It is hilarious, and Reba McEntire has just gotten better and better in her acting over the years.  Now some bad news, Season 4 may be the last season of Reba released on DVD.  Because of ""poor sales"" of the first four seasons, 20th Century Fox has no plans to release Seasons 5 and 6.  So please anyone who has been thinking of purchasing Reba on DVD, do it!  I guarantee you won't regret buying this awesome show!",1180483200,,825,4.25

2642895,5,B000HT3PEM,I have not had a chance to watch season 4 yet.  I'm still on season 3.  Reba is one out of two of my favorite shows though and I'm sure that season 4 is great.  I can't wait to watch it and I'm so disappointed that Reba is no longer going on.,1173312000,2,242,3.6153846153846154
2642896,1,B000HT3PEM,"The product came in a timely manner and plays as expected, but the outer case was bent along the spine and that disappoints me. The mailer that it was sent in was undamaged which means it was packaged for shipment already bent.  When I pay for a brand new product I expect it to look like a brand new product.",1173312000,,309,4.15
2642897,5,B000HT3PEM,"It was a joy to purchase season 4, and to see the same fine quality packaging as in seasons 1-3.  It is a smaller set than the previous seasons, containing only two disc folders instead of the usual three.  That is no matter, however, because the product is still wonderful.

As far as story line, we see the characters grow as people, and yet they still retain their humor.  Fantastic character interaction! This is one of the best ensamble casts ever.",1171843200,4,453,4.555555555555555

2642899,5,B000HT3PEM,"If you love Reba, you must have this.  The show has been cancelled after 8 years, and I hope they put them all on DVD.  Each character is fun.  The acting, timing, and comedy are superb.  Van is a hoot.  Reba Hart is priceless.  Barbara Jean makes your eyes water, she's so funny.  An unlikely story line, but it WORKS.  You know, I said if you love Reba, you must have this.  This actually made me love Reba.  I'm a new Reba fan.  In the rare moments that she sings, it's always a believable part of the story line, AND WHAT A TREAT.  Boy does she have some pipes!",1171324800,5,565,4.08256880733945

2642903,5,B000HT3PEM,Reba season 4 was great! My favorite episode would of had to have been when cheyenne sings in this kaorako bar and sounds horrible. I would definently tell everyone to get it for themselves!,1170374400,2,190,4.617647058823529
2642930,4,B000HT3PEM,I love Reba and it seems like every season gets better. I love the fact that the show is so qoutable and yet they still can get into serious topics and consequeces without dragging you down. This particular season was a lot brighter compared to the third season and yet not quite as funny as the second season which i would highly recomend. But all in all this season is defenitly worth adding to your reba collection.,1170201600,3,418,4.441558441558442
2642931,5,B000HT3PEM,"My wife and I have been following Reba since her show premired in 2001.  Not being Country music fans, we were reluctant to try it at first.  However, we had heard great things about her performance on Broadway in ""Annie Get Your Gun,"" and that's a long way from Nashville.  We have her first 3 seasons and are eagerly awaiting season #5.

This woman has a great command of comedy and the program offers answers to problems that arise all over America.  Of course the divorce situation may be stretched out a bit, but just because people can't stay married, there's no reason why they can't be civil towards one another.  ""Reba"" takes that situation (among others) and runs with it all the way to the bank.",1169856000,,706,4.519685039370079
2642932,4,B000HT3PEM,"""Reba"" debuted on the WB in the fall of 2001 and was the WB's number 1 sitcom for five years.  We all knew that Reba McEntire was a talented singer and she had done some acting before, but who knew she could carry a sitcom.  And be good at it.  Unlike some other sitcoms that are on the air, ex. ""According to Jim"" and ""Still Standing"", ""Reba"" is actually funny.  The cast is excellent and the writing is superb.  I don't know why Reba McEntire hasn't been nominated for an Emmy.

Season 4 aired during the 2004-2005 season with 22 episodes.  Unlike seasons 1-3, season 4 does not have any special features on it.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  The other sets have cast commentaries on certain episodes and featurettes.  Other than that, this is an excellent dvd set.  You will be happy with this one.",1169856000,4,803,4.322147651006712
2642933,5,B000HT3PEM,I love this show. It will remain a classic for many years to come.,1168905600,,66,3.7857142857142856
2642934,5,B000HT3PEM,"This series is outstanding(!), revisiting what I thought were extinct traditions when situation comedies were high quality and in good taste!  Stories are extremely witty, yet realistic.  Human behavior is written with such realism that it adds to the already near-unbearable humor.  Writing has depth, composition, and thought.  Acting is superb.  Characters and actors are superbly cast, including not only Reba herself, fitting perfectly with the character she portrays, but Melissa Peterman and Steve Howey also fitting in, and acting, superbly with the characters they portray.

Whoever is responsible for this show, thankyou for reviving good...no, excellent(!)...entertainment and television writing!

Sincerely,
