It is, in essence, a good movie to go to sleep after seeing it if you are bothered by an action film before going to sleep.",1483574400,,253,3.980392156862745

8059926,3,B0009F4ZRA,"This was the bottom half of a Universal double bill shown in UK cinemas, but a perfectly watchable low budget western with Darin well cast, and shot on the familiar Universal backlot.
Bad guy Leslie Neilsen's ranch headquarters is the Shiloh set from 'The Virginian' as if anyone in a 1967 audience didn't recognise it! Ex Ford stuntman Frank McGrath (Wooster in Wagon Train) makes one his final appearances in a wheelchair.
Hopefully a good clean print will soon be added to the Universal Vault series.",1315526400,5,503,4.8604651162790695
8059927,3,B0009F4ZRA,"This is a remake  of the 1956 movie  ""Showdown in Abilene"" ,and while not a carbon copy ,does stick pretty closely  to the original movie .Bobby Darin - a perfectly good actor,underused in movies,-plays Cal Wayne ,a disillusioned Confederate army veteran who returns to Abilene after the Civil War  .He refuses to use a gun since accidently shooting his best friend's brother some years previously .On his return  he finds that his best friend  is well on his way to being the Mr Big of the local area .He is Grant Evers( Leslie Nielsen)and Evers persuades Cal to become town sheriff believing he can easily be manipulated or killed should that need arise

Evers is not averse to using violence and intimidation to expand his Empire and he clashes with Cal and  matters come to a head when a neighbouring ranch worker(Michael Sarrazin)is brutally whipped by Evers' men .Cal is forced to strap on his guns and go after his old friend .The relationship between the two men is also complicated by their mutual atttraction for a young woman played by Emily Banks

It is well acted and is directed with some skill by William Hale -whose main output was in TV .The script rambles a bit but all in all this is a good B movie Western made at a time when that type of movie was on its way out.
Solid and watchable movie for Western lovers",1195948800,5,1329,4.527196652719665
8059928,5,B0009F4ZRA,I was twelve when I fell for Darin.  He's absolutely darinlicious in this film.  Well worth spending a Saturday afternoon with him.,1189728000,,131,4.909090909090909
8059929,4,B0009F4ZRA,"Considering all the third-rate movies that are released on DVD these days, why has no one bothered to release a DVD version of this DARIN opus?
It is not a classic movie. It is not even a classic western. But it's got Darin who is solid, if not spectacular as the sheriff. Leslie Nielsen is his old reliable self as the bad guy and Emily Banks should have had a lot more roles directed her way.
If you are looking for a message, something you can analyze to the...ZZZZZ...Ooops, sorry!, then this movie is not for you. If you want to waste a little bit of time and not have to work overly hard at deciphering what the story is ALL about,ALL the while being entertained, then it's Saturday Matinee ALL over again and this one's for you!",1185580800,,735,4.333333333333333
8059930,5,B0009F4ZRA,"This is not a great movie, but a Bobby Darin fan will love it.  He is in almost every scene and he looks terrific.  The acting is good by Bobby, Leslie Nielsen, Charles McGrath and Donnelly Rhodes.  I never tire of watching it just to see Bobby in action and in a white shirt that is cut down to his waist!  Had to give it 5 stars just because Darin is in it.  Can you tell I am a Bobby admirer?",1152316800,5,395,3.8271604938271606
8059931,3,B0009F4ZRA,"""Gunfight in Abilene"" is a faithful re-make of 1956's ""Showdown at Abilene."" Why anyone would choose to make another movie of this minor material, and why anyone would then decide to cast Bobby Darin in the role once played by Jock Mahoney, are mysteries for which there may be no solutions. By 1967, B-westerns had about run their course but as B-westerns go, this is competently made, despite its central miscasting, with occasional flashes of interest along the way. It has a pleasing song, (heard through the opening credits), which was written by Darin and it has a scene in which Michael Sarrazin is stripped to the waist, tied to the back of a wagon, and flogged. In the book, ""Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies,"" this flogging ranks 58th. Otherwise, there's not much here to recommend but fans of B-westerns will probably find this ""Gunfight"" tolerable.",1117324800,4,893,4.8431372549019605
