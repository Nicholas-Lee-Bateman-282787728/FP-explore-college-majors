8233171,3,B000YKI4OA,"Though I love my motorcycle, I hate television and never watch motorcycle racing. I just don't get it - it's not that exciting. I tried watching this in streaming format and didn't find it compelling - over two hours of slow paced chit chat with Troy, his parents, his sister, his wife... and excessive footage of people walking around, standing in locker rooms, in general not being interesting. Not much of a compelling story line - and a lot of filler. I bet if this was edited down to 60 minutes (leaving out crap about his wedding - seriously???) - it would be more interesting. Someone should've told his dad about sitting like that in front of the camera - e[...] Recommend this only for the most die hard racing/Troy Bayliss fans.",1316563200,,738,4.598484848484849
8233172,3,B000YKI4OA,"Although I liked The Doctor,The Tornado and The Kentucky Kid better,That is not to say this isn't worth watching, Troy Bayliss seems like a nice guy and a good racer I am not a big fan nor Much of a Ducati Fan but it is interesting and in depth with interviews with him and his family, His time Riding Kawasaki, Suzuki and Ducati.",1288396800,,330,4.253968253968254
8233173,3,B000YKI4OA,"There was a lot of great background of how Troy Bayliss got into racing but this really stops at 2002. There was really nothing about his 2 years with the Ducati MotoGp team, his year on the Honda MotoGp bike or his return to World Superbike other than a few sentences and images. I would have thought this newer DVD would have more of the recent history as well. This DVD shows what a great competitor and really nice guy Troy is.",1211760000,7,431,4.2682926829268295
