He had never seen this particular movie and (against my advice to skip it) really wanted to see what he'd missed. Needless to say, he wished he had listened.

Had a bedtime and it was one of the first directors to doing unrated directors cut direct to video considering this was the era of VHS. Anyways I was so happy when I was watching it that it was the directors cut, I had to look up the time difference to see which version was Whataway once I purchased it, because either way I already own the movie. But I was so happy to find out that I had actually bought a very excellent quality of directors cut in HD and Amazon really pulled out all the stops with this version for sale :-) so the digital edition they sell is indeed the unrated directors cut although it does say rated R addition, it is not .

A black cat just leapt in my path.
Im not superstitious, but this might
explain why Im failing in math.
By chance I walked under a ladder
a teacher had placed by the wall.
In class my umbrella popped open,
and thats why I tripped in the hall.
The salt spilled this morning at breakfast.
While walking I stepped on a crack.
I took off my shoes on the table.
It looks like my future is black.
This evening I busted a mirror
which means that the next seven years
are due to be filled with misfortune,
catastrophes, mishaps and tears.
With all the bad luck Im confronting,
it seems that Im probably cursed.

685155,1,6303579396,"During the 1980s, only two years passed without an entry in the Friday the 13th series. That's eight films in ten years, and while the quality usually betrayed those short production times, they always felt like kin. Spiritual relatives. It took four years for a ninth chapter to see the light of day, plus a switch from Paramount to New Line Cinema, and somewhere along the way there was a great disconnect. A true B-grade picture in every sense, Jason Goes to Hell is the worst Friday yet, and one of the most desperate, flailing, pointless films I've ever seen. Though veteran blade-swinger Kane Hodder has returned to the role, this Jason bears little resemblance to the cool, creepy psycho killer of the earlier films. Inflated and deformed, at this point he's basically a roid-raging leper in a twisted, vaguely-familiar hockey mask, but he's changed in more than just a physical sense. The story revolves around his black heart, literally migrating from host to host to inspire fresh killings after Jason himself is blown to bits in the opening scene. We've swallowed some absurdly stupid plot devices over the course of this franchise, including a similarly lame-brained ""fake Jason"" angle in 1985's A New Beginning, but this one sets an awful new standard. It plays like cruddy straight-to-video '90s gimmick horror, not the quaintly under-produced slasher material that had typified the series to this point. Needless to say, the acting hasn't improved (somehow, impossibly, it's actually grown much worse) and the production values, which enjoyed a well-deserved bump in Jason Takes Manhattan, are once again cut-rate and pitiful. Not a good look for New Line, proving right out of the gates that they don't understand what they're making and don't honestly care, one way or the other.",1477440000,,1796,5.05050505050505
685156,1,6303579396,The worst in the series. Who wants to watch a Jason movie with Jason barely in it? The whole storyline was stupid. The only good scene was the end where Krueger's hand pulls Jason's mask under the ground at the end. This sets up the Freddy versus Jason movie. Other than that I could've totally skipped it and not been upset about it one bit. I remember watching this when it first came out and hating it then. I rewatched it and know what? I still think it stinks. I even prefer Jason X over this one and that's saying a lot. The first Friday only had a small part for Jason at the end but there is no comparison between this film and that one. The first Friday was great and set up for all the sequels to follow. Besty Palmer was fantastic in her role as Jason's mother in the first film. For this one I would've preferred an entertaining story with the end being him getting blown up. Instead that's how they chose to start this disaster with a lot of ridiculousness following. Would give it 0 stars if I could.,1476403200,,1014,4.231958762886598

685187,5,6303579396,"This movie is BY FAR the best in the whole franchise.  There have been eight before this one.  You won't believe this:  this movie has a PLOT!!!  It has characters we care about, every one of them.  It references the Terminator for God's sake.  And the Hidden/Alien.  And Evil Dead.  It's amazing.  Four naked women.  Many of the killings are great; one of them is possibly the most insane thing I've ever seen in a horror movie.  It's funny.  Absolutely not one minute of this movie is annoying where you're yelling at the characters to stop being stupid.  Not a single repetitive murder to get the body count up.

Is it Citizen Kane?  Of course not.  But it is so far better than any other Friday the 13th movie, it's truly a surprise from the first minute to the last.  And I'm not exaggerating.  The ""best"" F13s are 1, 2, and 4, right?  6 is fun but goofy.  1 is good, but just a standard slasher movie that can't hold a candle to Halloween.  2 and 4 are good for F13 movies.

685206,1,6303579396,"I first saw this movie back in late '93 and it is one of the biggest pieces of garbage I've ever seen. I, and many others watch these movies to SEE Jason killing people, not Jason possessing people. You get Jason in it for maybe 7 or 8 minutes, and the rest of the time he's possessing people. Even wanted to make sure he looked good by shaving that naked cop before possessing him. Even though there's a good body count, the only one I count as Jason killing someone is when he bear hugs Duke, because it's JASON doing it, not Jason in someone's body.

I see 2 positives in this movie:

1: That girl in the tent getting impaled and torn in half
2: Freddy's glove pulling Jason's mask under

These 2 things are not worth sitting through almost 2 hours of garbage though. I own it, but I only own it to have the complete Friday the 13th series.",1458691200,2,843,4.191358024691358

685231,1,6303579396,"The Basic Gist:  Jason is tricked and lured to his death by a gorgeous and incredibly smokin' hot FBI agent as the barrage of feds open fire on him and blow Jason to smithereens.  One person however knows that that's not the total end of Jason and that person is bounty hunter Creighton Duke(Steven Williams, tv's 21 Jump Street).  As soon as Jason's body parts are taken to a morgue in Youngstown, Ohio, it isn't long before Phil the coroner eats most of Jason's heart and gets possessed by Jason.  Caught in the middle of this is Jason's sister Diana( Erin Gray, tv's Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and tv's Silver Spoons) ,her daughter, Jessica Kimble, tv newsman and Jessica's current boyfriend, Robert Campbell and Jessica's ex-boyfriend Steven Freeman(tv's Friday the 13th: The Series).  Duke knows what needs to be done about Jason and asks for a half a million dollars in bounty to see to the situation.  Jason mostly switches from body to body using some slimy parasite to live on, while he kills people through their bodies, as he's looking to be born again.  Can Steven and Creighton help to save the day or will Jason never actually be sent to hell?

The director is Adam Marcus.  This time Sean S. Cunningham(of whom directed the first Friday the 13th) returns as the producer.  The music is once again by Harry Manfredini.  Special Visual Effects are by Al Magliochetti.  The Special Makeup Effects are by Kurtzman, Nicotero, and Berger EFX Group.

This time atmosphere/surroundings, mood, and dreary weather take a total backseat.  The environment of the movie is so under-emphasized that any real feeling of dread isn't really developed.

The musical score that Harry Manfredini gives to this movie is uneven, not impressive, not scary or creepy, sounds like it belongs more in a murder mystery or a fantasy movie than a slasher/horror movie.  Sometimes it's just silly sounding noise.

The editing was, more often than not painfully slow.  In general, you see a scene of murder or action, which would then quickly next turn to a scene that just slows down the flow of the movie way too much.

I know that you're not supposed to expect great acting in one of these movies, but the acting here is so devastatingly corny and over the top, that it's just so embarrassingly and indisputably and in your face.

You would think what with Sean S. Cunningham coming back that they would have come up with something far better than this.  Why would he attach himself to this sad pile of manure anyway?

The characters were all one-dimensional and not interesting in the least.  Also, there is one unlikable character too many.  The sheriff is an annoying, aggravating pain in the a**, bounty hunter Creighton Duke is a sick, twisted, power mad a**hole, Pookey and Joey are two repulsive, annoying, aggressive, red neck rejects who get in Steven's way, Jessica is a bit of a b****, and Robert Campbell is a stereotypical sleazebag of a reporter.  It's all well and good to have one unlikable character or even two unlikable characters, after all that allows the audience somebody of whom the audience is thrilled to see die, but this movie really deluges the audience with an unacceptably big number of unlikable characters.

There are a couple of embarrassing sound effects.  The bullet ricochets when a gun is fired sound effect, sounds like an old western movie and Looney Tunes like and there's a scene where while Jason's possessing someone, he knocks one of his victims against the wall and there's this squishing sound effect.  Those sounds effects couldn't possibly be more ridiculous.

The gore effects are pretty good, but they're overused to the point of sickening and totally mean-spirited.  In particular, the scene where he possesses Robert's body after leaving Josh's and Josh(graphically) melts and falls apart.  That scene was just too unbelievably sick and uncalled for.  Also, the scene with Phil the coroner eating Jason's heart was both sickening and going too far.

What exactly was the point of the infamous ""Homo-Erotic Shaving"" scene.  Why was that pointless scene even used in the first place? It's not like it moved the movie along, but rather slowed it down.

The kill scenes were more disgusting and worthless rather than creative and entertaining.  There's not much to be said there, just that those scenes felt much too exploitative.

There's hardly any nudity and what there is of it is good, but the movie needed a bit more.  The only nude scene(s) is when those sexy young kids go to the old Crystal Lake campgrounds to sleep to have fun and sex.  Also, that was literally the only time that this bowel movement of a slasher actually felt like a Friday the 13th movie.

There were unquestionable plot-holes within.  The personal desire that Creighton has to take Jason down is never mentioned.  What it is that went wrong between Steven and Jessica's relationship is never explained.  Also how Creighton Duke even knows how to destroy Jason is totally unclear.  Finally, why don't they ever explain how Jason comes back to life after the events of part 8?

WTF is with that stupid f***ing slimy parasite.  That storyline is just a bunch of bull, it doesn't make any sense, and Jason has never body switched in any of the other movies so this is just ridiculous as it is idiotic.  What is the deal with that stupid thing?  Jason's not an alien or anything so again wtf?  Also, it's just ripping off the 1987 sci-fi/action movie, The Hidden.  Which by the way was everything this movie will never be.  Also, it's very disappointing that Jason has very little actual screen time and is mostly possessing people.

That scene where Creighton Duke is breaking Steven's fingers as payment for information on how to stop Jason is one seriously sick, sadistic, incomprehensible, and all together f***ed up scene that the movie just plain could've done well without.  Why would he get such a sick thrill out of breaking someone's fingers?  What a terrible and unbecoming act for someone to do when their supposed to be a hero.

There are no characters in this movie that I honestly gave a crap about.  Nobody in this movie is interesting, many of them are unlikable, and they're all too flat.  I know that I already mentioned much of this, but I just can't emphasize these points enough.

Overall, in the end this movie is just too crude, mean-spirited, has lame characters, has plot-holes, the plot doesn't make any sense, has slow dull scenes, is badly edited, the musical score is terrible, the gore is too over the top sickening, the secondary hero Creighton Duke is a scumbag, the cops are jerks, the main character Steven gets pummeled one time too many and usually for no good reason, it doesn't feel that much like a F13 movie, there's absolutely no continuity between this one and part 8 before it, the storyline is garbage, and it just pales egregiously in comparison to part's 1,2,3,4,6, and 7 before it. This is the number one worst chapter in the series that doesn't even fit with the rest much more than part 5 didn't.  It's a shame to waste Kane Hodder's time to cast him in another bad F13 movie.  I would recommend skipping this one just as much as parts 5 and 8 should be skipped also.  It's just plain worthless and not even worth seeing once.

Jason is destroyed at the outset and people infected with Jason go about killing people a la Jason but it's just not the same thing.  It's like Tinker Bell pretending to be Peter Pan.  The acting is desperate and overdone, a lot of wild eyes and strange affectations.  I just couldn't get past the disappointment of little to no Jason in a movie with his name in the title.

685311,3,6303579396,"At the beginning Jason was ambushed by a small army of FBI.  They hit him with over 100 rounds of various caliber rounds and then blew him to pieces.  Jason's body was destroyed, but his black heart and soul lived on - allowing him to possess others.

Jason was even more dangerous than usual in this chapter.  With his own body Jason simply guarded Crystal Lake.  But regular human bodies couldn't endure Jason's evil, they'd get diseased and Jason got weak.  He had to keep jumping from body to body.  Jason needed to be reborn, and only another Voorhees could do that.

Jason had a sister named Dianna, a niece named Jessica,  and Jessica had a baby girl.  If Jason took possession one of them his body would be restored.  But a professional bounty hunter, named Duke, had a mystical dagger.  In the hands of a Voorhees, he believed it could send Jason to Hell forever.

The climax was after Jason had used Dianna to restore himself.  Then Jessica buried the dagger in Jason's chest.  Mystical energy flowed from the dagger into the sky and ground.  The soil itself seemed to come alive and drag Jason underground.

685340,4,6303579396,"Well, let me start off by saying I got the chance to see this in the theater and liked it. Although, I always wondered how Jason was able to come back to life after the ending of part VIII. I went into it thinking that Jason was yet another illusion of Rennie Wickham from part 8, since she had ones of him a few times earlier in that one, so it could be possible.  New Line definitely wanted to get the two movie baddies (Friday and Nightmare)  in one film together and that is primarily THE reason they bought the rights to the franchise from here on out.  I didn't have a problem with that since I liked both franchises. I have to say that after seeing the theater version and then this UNRATED version, the UV definitely is THE one to have! Beautiful menu and nice special features are included. This movie takes a different approach to the previous Friday movies that had Jason killing camp counselors, weekend partyers and anyone that got in his unfortunate way at Camp Blood.
This time, the FBI sets up a ""sting"" operation on Jason himself and uses a lovely FBI agent as the bait. It works and lures out the killer to the set up. Startled, large lights flash all around and then numerous guns start blazing, even grenades. A direct hit on Jason's body sends it exploding in all directions. His then destroyed body is taken to the local hospital morgue for analysis under armed protection. (Kane Hodder himself plays an FBI agent standing guard). After one of the ""doctors"" becomes confused and hypnotized by the stand alone beating heart of the ""dead"" Jason, he proceeds to eat it, taking in the evil that is Jason all along. In this way, he transfers his evilness to any body that he wishes. Once the current body his ""evil"" is in begins to be destroyed, he then seeks out a new host to do his killing, ultimately seeking out the long, lost sister he never knew (reminds me of Michael Myers from Halloween) to be reborn as Jason again. Eventhough in part 1, Pamela Voorhees said herself she only had one child, Jason. It could be viewed that she had a step daughter of sorts, not born from her that she never discussed or revealed. Her main focus was on Jason, her only born child, that drowned while camp counselors were making love in a camp building.
There are some nifty horror cameos here, but they are items, not actors. We get to see the Book of the Dead and the Dagger from the ""Evil Dead"" movie, plus the Arctic Expedition Crate, (Julia Carpenter name on it) from ""Creepshow"" at one point. I recognized that right off or at least it looked really similar to it. The bounty hunter searching for Jason, although not new to the franchise, (see part 4), says he has been following Jason for years. He states he is the only one that knows how to kill Jason and put an end to him once and for all. The key lays in the family Voorhees, of course!  When Jason is stabbed with the ""evil dagger"", strange lights and ground rumblings begin to occur. Apparently Hell has opened its gates for Jason to finally go. Huge evil hands come up from below to bring Jason down to his ""final"" resting place. Or is it? A fellow nemesis comes up from below to snatch the last glimpse of what remained of Jason and his killer image.

685442,3,6303579396,"I'm not a gorehound and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of an unstoppable killer -- who increasingly becomes an infernal monster -- just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

The first two films are serious in tone with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagues the rest of the series with the exception of maybe IV, VII (maybe VIII) and the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.

Released in 1993, ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" is arguably the oddest entry in the series, which isn't much of a surprise since three of the last four installments were departures from the typical Friday formula -- Part V, VII (which features a Carrie-like character) and especially VIII (which switches the setting from Crystal Lake to a cruise ship and the big city).

The prologue shows Jason back at Crystal Lake. How'd he get back there after the events in Part VIII? The ending of that movie didn't show Jason completely destroyed, so we must assume that he made it out of the sewers of Manhattan and simply gravitated back to his familiar stomping grounds. Anyway, the opening is excellent and highlighted by one of the most stunning females in the entire series, Julie Michaels as Agent Marcus (which is saying a lot in light of the series having the best line of women of ANY movie franchise, except for Part VII, which was sub-par in this department).

Jason winds up in the morgue in Youngstown, Ohio, and the film takes an interesting twist reminiscent of the 80's cult film ""The Hidden."" Other bizarre additions to the Jason Voohees mythos include a magic sword, a strange ""Jason-Finder General"" character and the revelation of the only way the monster can be killed and resurrected. I don't mind the change of pace as the series was hackneyed after 8 films in 10 years from 1980-89 (albeit still entertaining). Besides, there are enough typical Friday-isms to please fans of the series, for instance the entire camp sequence and the prologue.

Some object on the grounds that Jason is supposedly a misunderstood manchild and this movie changes that. The only films fitting that model are Parts II, XI and the 2009 remake. Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII were more in line with the idea of Jason as a force of darkness & evil -- the curse on Crystal Lake or whatever. And Parts III and IV had him killing a pregnant girl, psychologically torturing the heroine, and attempting to kill a boy after slaying his mother, so he wasn't exactly Lenny from ""Of Mice and Men"" as these critics maintain. Face it, although Jason may have been an innocent deformed child at one time, the seed of evil (possibly a demonic spirit) entered into his heart at some point and he increasingly became a hideous infernal monster and you have to give this entry credit for trying to fill in the bones with corpse flesh, whether you accept these revelations or not.

Unfortunately the final act goes so over-the-top with the action and horror shenanigans that the movie becomes cartoonish and laughable. Take, for instance, the fight between the deputy and Steven (or whatever his name is). As such, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is one of my least favorite in the series, along with Parts III and VII. Nevertheless, it's still an entertaining and worthy installment in the series.

Besides the awe-inspiring Agent Marcus in the prologue, we get a couple of cute campers, Deborah and Alexis, with Deborah (Michelle Clunie) particularly shining. There's also Jessica, who turns out to be the main protagonist, her mom (the goddess Erin Gray from ""Buck Rogers"") and Vicki from the restaurant. Needless to say, great job on the babe front.

For those who care (I don't) this entry seriously ups the ante in the horrific gore factor.

As far as locations go, ""JGTH"" goes back to Southern Californ in the tradition of Parts III, IV and V.

Many people find these films scary and shocking and they do have some creepy aspects and jump scares, but -- with the exception of the 2009 reboot -- I don't find them particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Jason Goes to Hell"" gets props for its radical departure from the Friday formula, even while containing obvious Friday-isms -- the youths, the babes, Crystal Lake and so on. But the final act spins out of control with quasi-horror zaniness and becomes a joke. Still, any movie that features Agent Marcus and Deborah can't be all bad, lol.

The film runs 87 minutes.

I guess the writers decided to try & reimagine the series, but failed horrible. This is the Highlander 2 of the Friday the 13th series, it try's to destroy any connection we may have to the rest of the franchise isolating its fan base. In this film Jason has a half-sister who's daughter has an infant child. Jason needs to re-birth himself through another Voorhees. He does so by vomiting up a worm creature from his mouth into another persons mouth. Earlier in the film Jason's original body was destroyed, but he was resurrected into a new host when the guy doing the autopsy ate Jason's heart. So for the rest of the film we don't even see ""Jason"" just what ever body he decided to throw up his worm creature into, taking control of their body. But just temporarily, that's why he is after a Voorhees so he can fully re-birth himself. What does this even have to do with a hockey mask wearing zombie serial killer that murders teens at a camp? The writers must have been on drugs. And don't even get me started on the ""bounty hunter"" guy who just happens to know everything about Jason in this film.

P: Jason is blown to pieces after a police ambush, but his spirit is resurrected jumping from body to body in an effort to be born again.

Misguided sequel ignores most of the other entries in the series and forgets about logic & reason. It throws in some mumbo jumbo saying that Jason is an evil spirit. It then wallows in its own cruelty, torture, gore and excessive violence while the other Friday the 13th movies had a certain spirit & cheerful disposition to their death sequences that made Jason a modern day anti-hero.

Theres also a serious lack of Jason. Jason is talked about throughout the film, but other then the opening and closing of the movie, he isn't anywhere to be found as this sequel has him jumping from one body to the next. Jason, in his true physical form, hockey mask and all, is the selling point of this series. Jason is the heart and soul of this series and you just can't exclude him from a film bearing his name.

685505,4,6303579396,"Jason Goes To Hell: Final Friday is actually a pretty good film for the finale of the series (I don't consider Jason X part of the series), despite what many may say.

The movie begins with Jason chasing Elizabeth Marcus through the woods of Crystal Lake and it turns out that the chase was all a trap for Jason. Elizabeth turns out to be an Undercover FBI agent and once she's lead Jason to an opening in the woods, he's blown to pieces by a Government Task Force. His remains are taken to a morgue for an autopsy where a bounty hunter/coroner by the name of Creighton Duke is suddenly hypnotized by Jason's heart, compelling him to eat it. This causes Creighton to become possessed by the spirit of Jason, who goes on a killing spree, leading to Crystal Lake.

Jason's spirit must move to new hosts due to the bodies it infests, dying from decaying tissue and being damaged by gunfire, disease, etc. This transfer happens by the host body regurgitating a demonic worm-like creature and spitting it into the mouth of the new host.

Jason ends up possessing the body of Josh Brennan and heads to the house of his half sister, Diana and kills her. Steven, Diana's son in law is framed for the murder and arrested where he meets Creighton in prison who informs him that only relatives of Jason have the ability to kill him for good or make him reborn. The only remaining relatives of Jason are his half-sister Diana Kimble, her daughter Jessica, and her infant daughter Stephanie.

From that point on, Steven and Creighton work together to track down Jessica to track down Jason and kill him once and for all. Unfortunately their plans fail as the worm creature crawls inside the dead body of Diana (in a rather interesting way I may add), thus bringing Jason back to his original form.

On the fortunate side for them, Jessica manages to kill Jason by stabbing him in the chest with a dagger. Jason is then dragged to hell by demon hands while the tortured souls of the victims he's killed are released into the air. The end of the movie is a mark out moment as it sets off the events for Freddy vs Jason which wouldn't be released in theaters until 10 years later.

Overall, I consider Jason Goes To Hell to be the final installment of the Friday the 13th series and in my opinion it couldn't have ended in a better way. Similar to how fans negatively criticize Halloween III for having a lack of Michael Myers, Friday the 13th fans negatively criticize Jason Goes To Hell for featuring a lack of Jason. But just like Halloween III, Jason Goes To Hell didn't need the main character throughout the film to make it good. All the actors placed in the film to portray the spirit of Jason did fantastic and kept it watchable, especially Steven Williams who portrays Creighton Duke and makes certain scenes in the move entertaining to watch x1000! Give it a chance and watch it with an open mind and you won't be disappointed",1386892800,,2920,4.520833333333333
685506,2,6303579396,"This is by far one of the most displeasing Friday the 13th's ever released. Jason Goes to Hell has obnoxious characters, virtually 'no limit' plot holes, and essentially no storyline of any kind.

The plot was reminiscent of The Thing (1982) meets Jason. This film is a complete financial exploitation of The Hidden (1987), which if you actually like Jason Goes to Hell, you should acquire. It's unquestionably really difficult to be the worst film in the Friday the 13th series with Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986), Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988), Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) on the slab but this somehow manages.

This film is full of tired supernatural cliches, unoriginal characters, and continuity issues. The direction is highly unskilled and seems to fall into the dull trap that suffocated the Halloween (1978) series and turned it into a feebleminded comedy show (including Rob Zombie's moronic new Halloween (2007)).

Whoever decided to take the incompetent screenplay and accept it for a Friday the 13th film should be pelted with rotten vegetables.",1383177600,,1116,5.054347826086956

I also liked how the majorty of the film wasn't like the others,where you had a bunch of sex crazed teenie boppers running around. It was also pretty cool to see John LeMay in this film,since he was in the Friday The 13th Series,which I loved. The characters were also great. I especially loved the Joey character.

685508,1,6303579396,"Let me begin by saying, that if I could sell this DVD on this site, or any other auction site, and make enough to wipe away my profound disappointment in this film, I would do it. In a heartbeat. And one of the main reasons I do feel this way, is because I expected that if Sean Cunningham would involve himself in another one of these movies, after doing such a brilliant job with the first film, that I was about to see something that would make up for the slow decline of the movie series, over the years.

I have seen excuses for this movie, all over the internet, one of the main ones being that it is not supposed to be a follow up to the events that happened in 'Friday the 13th: Jason Goes To New York'. I didn't know that when I watched this, but it is not an unforgivable faux pas.

However, the rest of this film is.

Friday the 13th: Jason Goes to Hell, veers off into a completely different and unimaginative direction. Gone is the undead killer, skulking around Crystal Lake, looking to kill anyone and anything that he feels needs killing. No careless teens running amok, boozing it up and having wild sex in places no decent person would.  Also missing was the feeling that Jason's prey was trapped in one particular area of the lake.

What replaced all of that, was the equivalent of some sort of voodoo/demonic possession movie. Jason possessed people, drove cars, moved around the small town and killed whomever happened to be standing next to the person he was now in. What does 'hell' have to do with the movie? Eventually, Jason regains his body and is pulled down to hell by graspy, paper mache looking claws.

I would never tell anyone to not see this movie, especially if they have seen every other film in this series because despite claims of otherwise, I do believe it is part of the film series as a whole. I will suggest, however, that people rent it or even get it from their local library.",1382054400,,1921,4.397183098591549

But as a fan of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B003COE90S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;and its sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-II/dp/B001DCZ4HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th - Part II</a>, I've always felt the series was hit or miss (mostly formulaic ""miss"") after those two anyway.

The opening scene of the film is INTENTIONALLY over-the-top and bombastic...literally...meant to hook you in. If you're a fan of the F13 / Halloween school of filmmaking, I think you'll like it. The problems begin AFTER the opening scene. No spoilers, like I said...let's just say that the filmmakers attempt to something a little different with the Jason concept. You may think it's edgy and original or you may yell ""BOGUS!""

After you get past THIS part of the film, your back in the land of pre-fab formula slice & dice.

The introduction of the ""Creighton Duke"" character (portrayed by Steven Williams) is an attempt to add an additional undercurrent of menace beneath the already existing menace of Jason Voorhees. It ends up less of an ""Oscar-worthy performance"" from Williams and more of an idea that probably sounded great on paper...bad lil' doggie's bite never quite matches his bark.

The movie was SUPPOSED to seque directly into ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" which didn't arrive until a decade later. Instead, F13 viewers got ""Jason X"" (sending Jason into space so that he could orbit the Earth while the powers that be untied the knots in the ""Freddy vs. Jason"" project).

In the final analysis, this movie may hold more value for you as a rental than as a purchase...hard to say, depends on your tastes.

There is however some degree of entertainment offered by the film with reminiscent kills and suspense leading up to each climatic murder that has kept fans of these films coming back for years. The movie series itself has never fared spectacularly at the box office, but has endured as a coming of age cult classic - which is the reason I have remained a fan of the franchise. This particular film only served as an entry to keep pushing along the franchise and its meager effort succeeds in that respect.

685698,5,6303579396,"*****Spoilers*****

The whole inside joke about this film (that Adam Marcus took an epic fail miss in making) is that this is the Evil Dead Friday the 13Th.  Evil Dead is a 'cult' horror film that has a huge underground fallowing.  The Necronomicon being present in the film was the tip.  As well as a dagger that looks like the Evil Dead Dagger.

It was an epic fail because the horror fans (and average audience) didn't have a flying cow clue what was happening in this movie.  Evil Dead is a cult film, not a mainstream film.  As such, most people

just
didn't
get
it.

If you watch the Evil Dead before you watch this film, the film makes perfect and complete sense.  Jason is a Deadite (Candarian Demon) human hybrid.  His Mother clearly used the Necronomicon to bring Jason back (which is why the book is still in her house.)  This is why Jason never dies for good in any of the Friday the 13Th Media; and why he has his demonic powers.  The Evil Dead is like the base game (Doom 3) whereas Jason Goes to Hell is like the Expansion Pack (Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil.)

Because of the fact that most people (even a lot of horror fans) didn't get what was happening; they just thought the Necronomicon appearance was nothing more than a cameo; and failed to understand that it was the tip for horror fans to use to uncover the entire inside joke that is this movie (that Jason is a Deadite Human Hybrid.)  This fact is almost spelled out word for word in the two Freddy VS Jason VS Ash Comic Books.  Yet, many fans still don't get this.

Watching this film without watching the Evil Dead is like trying to play an expansion pack without the base game; it just doesn't work.  Without the Evil Dead as a base for understanding; Jason Goes to Hell just looks completely out of the box.

I love this film because Adam really took a chance and did something unique with it.  I just feel bad that so many people did not like or get the angle he was going at.  The film was Part 9 after all.  I appreciated the creative spirit that he brought to the film in trying to do something new, fresh, and tongue and cheek with it.

I hope that someday the fans will learn to respect what this movie really did; instead of looking away like it's not there.",1329696000,,2244,4.3031026252983295

Despite having a rather decent cast for once, This movie isn't really too interesting aside from the very shocking finale [which serves as the setup for Freddy VS. Jason]. Arguably the darkest, goriest, and most gruesome of all the Jason films this should deliver the goods for the biggest Jason fan. Others might wanna just rent this one.

685704,2,6303579396,"I really don't know why I'm even bothering writing a review here. For some reason, after re-watching the movie once again recently I felt compelled to finally tackle this one. So where do I start? Good Question. First off, I'm a huge Friday the 13th fan. Have been since I was a little kid. Yes, they are all pretty campy and cheesy. Gratuitous sex and violence, weak plot, weak acting..all that stuff. But that's one thing you have to learn to accept and love if you're a fan of the genre. However, this film takes some of this to a whole new level. In a nutshell, it's just plain ridiculous. Yeah, I know its the 9th installment of the series and they were looking to do something different. They were looking to kill Jason once and for all. Though I think by now, most people knew that even Hell wouldn't stop Hollywood from making more sequels. Anyway, the plot to this film is just so over the top stupid that you can't help but ask yourself ""So this was the best idea they had to finally kill Jason off?"" What makes this so bad is that they add so much extra crap to a well established character and story then expect the audience to just accept it. After 8 films, all of a sudden..there's a Voorhees house, a Voorhees Dagger and Book of the Dead (yes, the same ones from Evil Dead), Jason is a Great Uncle now, has a sister and a niece with a baby. There's a bounty hunter chasing him, who apparently decided to wait 15 years or so to try to actually stop him. Jason can switch bodies. Be re-born. Compel people to eat his heart. Has a small creature inside him that can crawl into bodies. Oh, and he shaves a naked man's face strapped to a table so he can shove his tongue down his throat. No, I'm not making any of this up. But besides that, this movie is pretty normal huh? Hey, I'm all about trying new things out with a horror franchise. Adding some new twists and turns. Not trying to make the same movies over and over. But this? It's just way too much silliness. Compared to this crap, I'd rather just see some naked kids get killed in cool ways until one chick is left and she gets the best of Jason. Yeah, maybe not original. Maybe silly. But come on, it makes more sense than this. Not only that, but this movie don't even give you much of the nostalgia factor in actually seeing Jason on screen. He's there for the first 2 minutes and gets blown to bits. Then random shots here and there for a few seconds, til the last 5 minutes or so. So you're not even getting the redeeming quality that at least you're getting to see Jason kill people. You're seeing Jason inside other people's bodies. Yeah, that's what I want to see when I watch Friday the 13th. A doctor, a cop or a guy in a suit killing people, and you have to go ""Oh, but its really Jason!"". No thanks. Call me old-fashioned, but how bout trying to stick with what apparently worked for 8 previous films. Yes, change up some stuff here and there if you want, but don't go crazy just because its supposed to be ""Final"" Friday the 13th film. I still can't believe that Sean Cunningham had anything to do with this, but for some reason he produced it. If I had created the Jason character and story, and these people added all this ridiculous story lines to it almost  15 years later just to try to kill him off, I'd be kinda upset about it. But that's just me. Look, I know its just a movie. And especially with these films, they're not supposed to be taken too seriously. But I find this one just so silly that I just tend to ignore it as far as the Friday the 13th series goes. I do own this movie however, because I'm a collector of the genre, and overall, Friday the 13th is my favorite horror franchise. If you're a horror fan, then undoubtedly you've seen this and you have your own opinion. And there's actually a strong following to this movie who will defend it as being creative and imaginative. I, however, am not one of those people. If by chance you haven't seen this one yet, well, I can't tell you I'm sorry that I gave away some stuff about the movie here. I actually think I did you a favor. Sure, I suggest you watch this at least one and just see what I'm talking about.

One of the things that was changed was the way that Jason looked, while in the Paramount Friday the 13th's Jason had more of a sinister look to him making him look a little more freaky looking.  In this one Jason does look good, but overall I don't think that he looks scary enough, though that don't stop this movie having any gross parts to comic parts that's been known to be in some of these movies.

My first instinct was """"Ooooooooooo is he going to be killing people in hell"""", sadly that didn't come true, but thats a pretty cool idea if I must say.

It opens with some chick driving to a mobile home in crystal lake, taking a shower, and it then tracked down by Jason. But it turns out she was with the FBI, and all these troopers pop out and blow jason to bits, successfully killing him once and for all. But as they are doing an autopsy on Jason, the employee for whatever crazy reason takes a bite out of Jasons beating heart, and has Jasons soul inside of him, and starts killing people, then this guy starts spreading the soul of Jason to other people.

Jasons spirit at some points of the movie turn into this worm / slug thing (as you see on the cover). Its all up to this one guy (i forget his name) to stop the evil. This movie progresses very slow throughout, and not gory one bit, the idea of possession ina film like this is kind of absurd, I thought the ending was stupid with the Freddy Glove, and let me just continue to say.....

The plot was reminiscent of The Thing (1982) meets Jason.  This film is a complete financial exploitation of The Hidden (1987), which if you actually like Jason Goes to Hell, you should acquire. It's unquestionably really difficult to be the worst film in the Friday the 13th series with Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986), Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988), Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) on the slab but this somehow manages.

This film is full of tired supernatural cliches, unoriginal characters, and continuity issues.  The direction is highly unskilled and seems to fall into the dull trap that suffocated the Halloween (1978) series and turned it into a feebleminded comedy show (including Rob Zombie's moronic new Halloween (2007)).

685775,4,6303579396,"The Pro's:

It had to be different because they'd already suppossedly killed Jason for the last time in the Final Chapter. Secondly, it's an intriguing idea to go outside Camp Crystal Lake and witness how the legend of Jason Voorhees has effected the community. I think doing this was a daring move. It's the only film, other than the first one, to give us some kind of back-story and add more to the mythos and genealogy of Jason Voorhees. Also, Jason Goes To Hell is one of four Friday films starring Kane Hodder as Jason. Hodder is widely recognized as the best Jason but the four films he played Jason in are commonly considered the weakest entries in the series, with the exception of A New Beginning in which Jason did not appear. I have a theory that the Kane Hodder entries (Part's VII,VIII,IX and X) are probably brought down by Friday traditionalists--in my opinion, traditionalists are probably older fans that remember the first one when it was in theaters and consider the first four films the best because they stuck closest to the original template created by Sean S. Cunningham. It seems to me, the Friday traditionalists have a problem with substance, or a stand-alone story line, in their Friday films. I can see the point of this argument and I would be in favor of it if the additional story elements slowed the films down or got in the way of the chief reason why people go to see these movies, horrific violence. (Now, I know what you're going to say, we go to these movies to see Jason! And, Jason's barely in this installment! Well, I'll get to that in the next paragraph!) Keeping that in mind, Jason Goes To Hell is probably the goriest entry in the Friday series and all of the gore is intact in the final cut of the movie. Unlike the sequels before it, Jason Goes To Hell--like all the Fridays released by New Line--was released on video in both un-rated and rated editions. Lastly, the acting. I think John D. LeMay and Kari Keegan do good work as the two leads, and the bounty hunter character, Creighton Duke, as played by Steven Williams, is a step above most characters typically created for the Friday The 13th universe.

P.S. the ending is killer (no pun intended).

The Cons:

Yes, Jason is only in the beginning and the end of the movie. Yes, it's poorly shot; it looks like a TV movie from the 80's. Acting is irrelevant because the acting is inconsistent in all of the Friday films. Scripting, again, this is a Friday the 13th film. Yes, it's stupid, and, yes, it's disappointing as a ""final"" entry. Another complaint is that it borrows heavily from other horror films, as if the first Friday didn't borrow heavily from Halloween and Psycho. I think the most likely excuse for this ""borrowing"" is that the young screenwriters (Adam Marcus, who is also the director, and Dean Lorey, who also stars as the coroner that gets killed by Jason) were probably just writing what they knew - horror movies. Whether or not these plot similarities are intentional or unintentional, as a whole, I think the story is unique for what it is.

In Summary:

Not a bad film, not a great film, Jason Goes To Hell is, however, unfairly maligned by fans of the series. It deserves a second viewing because it gives fans a glimpse into the mythos of Jason Voorhees and shows what it's like living and growing up as a resident of Crystal Lake. However, if you're not interested in plot or thinking outside the Camp Crystal Lake box, then you might be interested to know that there's more gore in this film than in any other entry in the series.

685807,2,6303579396,"Jason Voorhees is believed to be dead, but his murderous rampage lives on. He's able to transfer from body to body, but each host deteriorates at an incredible rate and he has to switch frequently. Meanwhile, Steven goes to meet Diana one night, who happens to be his ex-wife's mother. She has something very important to tell Steven. You see, Diana is the sister of Jason Voorhees and Jessica, Steven's ex, is his niece. Steven and Jessica have a baby named Stephanie, as well. According to Creighton Duke, a bounty hunter, the only way anyone can kill Jason is by destroying his heart and it has to be done by a blood relative. Not only that, but he can also be reborn by transferring into the body of another Voorhees. So after Diana is killed in a scuffle with ""Jason,"" that only leaves Jessica and Stephanie. Steven has no choice, but to protect his family even though he's believed to be the one who killed Diana and has the police hot on his trail every step of the way.

For a Friday the 13th film, the acting in this is surprisingly good. It still has a few actors that make you groan, but the actors who get the most face time are decent and get the job done. In fact, I probably would've rated this a few points higher if it wasn't for a few factors. The main one being that Jason is a worm. That's right. A freaking worm. Not only that, but he's like this demonic worm thing that the worms in Dreamcatcher would probably find attractive. If they hadn't tried to give Jason this supernatural explanation and had something else in its place, this would have been a lot better. Jason, like the actual Jason with the hockey mask, is really only in the film for maybe ten to fifteen minutes tops. So that hurts the film, in my eyes. They also made Jason make all these weird noises this time around. He was wheezing, breathing heavily, groaning, and grunting. It didn't fit the character. He was generally silent up until this film and is again in Jason X. So...what the hell? It's a disappointing sendoff overall for a film labeled as The Final Friday. I guess it wasn't completely pointless. We did get the Freddy Vs Jason tease at the end, which wasn't really followed up on for ten years. But I digress...

685811,1,6303579396,"With this being a Friday the 13th movie (I suppose), I really wanted to enjoy it and tried to enjoy it but sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

First of all, FOR SHAME on the directer/producers etc for calling this a Friday the 13th movie and puttin Jasons picture on the front of the DVD box. Jason dies 6 or 7 minutes into the movie and we don't see him again untill the final 5 minutes (and I'm not exagerating).

A coroner eats Jasons heart from his dead body and is ""possesed"" by Jason. He then ""passes on"" Jasons heart to somebody else and a series of 4 or 5 people end up being ""possesed"" by Jason. There is NO main character(s) in the movie, the protagonist just keeps getting killed and it jumps to a new one overy 10 minutes or so.

Deffinatly the goriest in the series so far but it's not good gore (ie bloody or creative death scenes, like in previous Friday the 13th movies) it's just disgusting. Gore doesn't bother me or anything but in this movie it served no purpose other than it made me feel sick (in 2 scenes).

I know I'll probably get 0 out of 387 people finding this review helpfull, but I'm just giving my honest opinion. I would recomend any other Friday movie (even parts 5 and 7 which aren't great but are far better than ""Jason Goes To Hell"").

Terrible movie, not even worth watching for the most hardcore of fans. Thank God they made Jason X and Freddy vs Jason, such a great series did not deserve this movie for an ending.",1237593600,10,1481,4.219081272084805
685812,3,6303579396,"Happy Friday the 13th!  We love you Jason.  Wherever you are!

  First of all, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is not the final entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise.  New Line Cinema later produced the futuristic ""Jason X"" in which astronauts find a frozen Jason and take him aboard their spacecraft for more mayhem.  ""Jason Goes to Hell"" attempts to reveal Jason's secret as to why he can not be destroyed.  A grotesque eel-like creature (of demonic origin) with rows of sharp teeth has been keeping Jason alive ever since he supposedly drowned at Crystal Lake.  It reminded me much of ""The Hidden,"" a superior science fiction horror film starring Michael Nouri as a detective tracking down an eel-like alien who travels from one human host to another via their mouth.

  John D. Lemay (who played Ryan in the ""Friday the 13th"" hit television series) is Steven Freeman; he must find and destroy the creature before it enters the body of a Voorhees descendant and is reborn as Jason Voorhees.  This film had a good premise; it would've been much better if the acting wasn't amateurish and the plot predictable and silly.  ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is the goriest of the entries, as though the gore would conceal the acting and plot deficiencies.  Also, the ending was very unbelievable.  Jason continuously slaps and tosses John D. Lemay around, as though he is a puppet, without killing him; others have been easily killed with a single strike.

  On a high note, the director of the original ""Friday the 13th,"" Sean S. Cunningham, returns to direct this one.  Also, the legendary Harry Manfredini has returned to provide another creepy, suspenseful score.

  ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is definitely different from all of the other entries.  Too different for many fans and critics.  Despite its shortcomings, however, I still enjoyed this film.  It is recommended for fans of Jason Voorhees.  All others should rent before purchasing.

Note:  The ""Friday the 13th"" remake was heavily criticized because Jason took someone hostage; fans complained he'd never done that.  In ""Jason Goes to Hell,"" he takes a police officer hostage.  In fact, he straps him to a table, strips him naked, and shaves his face before subsequently possessing his body.  Why the stripping and shaving, I'll never know.  Perhaps it was a Satanic ritual.  Jason didn't do it when possessing the coroner or the slimy newscaster.",1236902400,2,2385,4.894736842105263

685815,1,6303579396,"I've tried looking at this movie from every angle: As part of the continuing series (or the conclusion of the series, since it IS the FINAL Friday) its just a bad, bad, cheesy, pathetic, lame, unjust, bad way to end the series. Jason had built up over the course of the last 7 movies (not counting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-V/dp/B00005NG6D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part V</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-I/dp/B001K9OXDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part I</a>) and we've put up with a lot of stuff, as well as Jason himself has. But the storyline was just pathetic. The whole backstory of Jason going after his family is too much like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B00009UW0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;ripoff. It started in Crystal Lake and that's where it should have ended, like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-VI/dp/B00005NG6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part VI</a>. And Jason is only in the movie for 15 minutes! They owe us (and Jason) more than some pathetic storyline.

Even if you look at it as a seperate movie, outside of the series (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-X/dp/B00006FI0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason X</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason</a>) it fails miserably as well. I just don't buy the doctor eating Jason's heart in the beginning, without any explanation as to why; a voiceover of Jason saying ""eat me!"" for example. And the concept of a Bounty Hunter going after Jason, knowing all of what he knows without any reasoning (a surviving member of Jason's rampage, perhaps) seems cheap as well.

The ONLY adding factor is that we learn who Jason's father is (Elias, stupid name I know), and that he had a sister; although that seems to be really pushing it and takes a lot to swallow. First we have to assume that Elias and Pamela split up after Jason was concieved, and that Elias knocked up someone else to give us Diana. Elias & Diana are NEVER mentioned in any of the other movies, so as far as we know they never existed, and probably should have stayed that way.

This movie was an abomination from beginning to end. It starts out in a familiar setting and then you're like, ""what the f-ck is going on?"" And you're doing that throughout the whole movie. Believe me, this is one movie you can pass on, whether you're a fan of the series or not. It's just plain bad!!",1233446400,2,2717,6.259358288770054

This of course is not true, because it would have happened in the previous movies. Also, who is this ""Duke"" character?

685857,1,6303579396,"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (Adam Marcus, 1993)

It pains me to admit that I didn't realize until about ten minutes into watching this piece of dreck that I'd already seen it. It's downright embarrassing to admit that after I realized this, I did, in fact, watch the remainder of the movie again. Why would I put myself through such horror again? Your guess is as good as mine. But I did. And since I did, I might as well review it. I can sum my review up in three words: ""Oh, the humanity."" But since three-word reviews are not looked upon kindly by those in the movie-buying community, I will take a few minutes to expand on my reaction.

Plot: after an FBI sting, Jason (Kane Hodder) is finally taken down. Or is he? When he gets to the morgue (in pieces, of course), his heart begins beating again, and he possesses (by means of the movie's best scene, actually) the coroner working on him (Daddy Day Camp's Richard Gant). And thus begins Jason's newest talent-- travelling from body to body in order to get himself into a situation where he can be reborn. (If this sounds familiar, it is--this device was used to much greater effect in the 1998 movie Fallen.) Along the way, of course, are all the old tropes of the Friday the 13th movies that make them such a neocon's dream--if you use drugs or have premarital sex, you die. The difference here is that some of Jason's victims are actually premeditated. Then, of course, there's the big showdown, the two minutes where you get to believe Jason is really dead, and the final scene showing he isn't. (Or, in this case, finally giving the fans the hope that Freddy vs. Jason was actually going to get made, though it took ten years.)

Everyone knows there hasn't been a good Friday the 13th movie since #2. For a while, they just kept getting dumber and dumber, but Jason Goes to Hell was a true nadir; even Jason X wasn't this completely awful. It's useless to go into the technical specs, since this series has set the baseline for bad acting, woeful direction, cinematography that ranges from campy to crappy, and taking itself way, way too seriously. But really, in the age of director's cut DVDs, you'd expect more of everything (no matter how bad it is) from an unrated Friday the 13th movie.

685863,5,6303579396,"""Jason Goes to Hell"" is a great entry into the series and isn't the same story that had been played seven movies before it where Jason kills people who go to Crystal Lake. This movie has things that any horror fan would love; melting people and tons of killing. No, it doesn't have much of ""Jason"" as you know him-but it is the same character. That is the difference between this and the fifth movie, this is actually still Jason, even though he is in different bodies.

Watching this and seeing the Necronomicon from the Evil Dead series appear on the film makes me sad that Ash won't be in the next Freddy vs. Jason movie. It would be a great intro into the next film, just like Freddy's hand was a prelude to FvJ.

Overall, I loved it. I saw this movie as a kid and just watched it again and I thought it was great. It has great special effects and an interesting story that is a change of pace. So, it depends on what you like. If you watch the movie just to see a hockey mask killer, then you won't like it that much. But if you like something different, this will be for you. But what you have to remember, it is still Jason that is the killer. Halloween III didn't have Michael in it in any way, shape or form.

685864,4,6303579396,"Fangoria said...This has the mose incredible ending we've ever seen. For the time period they were probably right as far as The ""Friday"" series goes. With the lackluster and lame ""a new beginning"", the nearly awful Jason Takes Manhattan and The ""Space Epic"" of Jason X this movie has both the humor and the gore and effects all in the right amount. Yeah Jason is jumping bodies but it's still him, so he's still in the whole movie. Kane Hodder playing Jason as only he can. If your not a huge ""Friday"" fan this is one of the ones to see. Do yourself a favor and stick to the ""unrated"" version and you've even got Kane Hodder playing a ""security guard"" and the extra's include a really good commentary by the director and screenwriter. You've even got a Cameo appearance of L.A.'s famous KLOS Morning DJ's Mark and Brian and cops. Of all the ""friday's"" this is one of the ones I enjoy watching more often then the others. I'd rank it up there with ""The New Blood"", ""The Final Chapter"" and ""Jason Lives"". The entertainment value is in the fact the movie doesn't take itself so seriously. It has great ""momments"" even if it doesn't succeed as a whole.
Take it for what it is an 80's style slasher flick.",1201046400,2,1200,4.4343891402714934

Here recently I began to dig into the Friday the 13th series. I watched this sequel last.  I had high expectations for it, so did it live up to them?  Jason Goes to Hell most certainly met my high expectations and then some.  I loved the film from the first shot.  The film is a blast to watch.  I knew before watching that Jason wasn't in the film as much as he was in the last few sequels. That intrigued me a great deal.  For once the Fridays tried to incorporate some new fresh ideas.  It seems that most didn't seem to like it.  I found it largely refreshing. Like I noted, the film is a riot act.  Any gore fan will love it.  It surprised me how much gore was actually in it(the unrated version). Jason, for what little he is in the film, looks creepy as hell.  I absolutely loved the beginning of the film and once it starts it won't let you go.  I find many of the Friday the 13th movies to drag in places, this certainly strays away for the slow pacing.  The acting is amongst the best in the series.  You actually start to feel a  little compassion for the characters.  I loved the actor who played Steven.  Theres nothing cooler than a nerd you can root for.  The death scenes are absolutely awesome and incredibly well done.  The photography is the best in the series. The Friday the 13th films usually don't have too many cool shots or special photography.  Here there are some really nice shots of Jason and over all the film has a great look and dark atmosphere.  I truly don't understand some of these low reviews. The film is incredibly fun to watch.  While I really never find any movie particular scary, this is amongst the creepiest.

But, a coroner who examines Jason's corpse eats his still-beating heart which invites the evil spirit of Jason into his body and it continues the deadly rampage of Jason Voorhees. It's also revealed for the first time ever that Jason has a long-lost sister who also recently had a baby and she's the only key to putting Jason to death for good. The acting is much better than usual, This movie features the best attempt at a plot any Jason movie ever had, And the movie has some pretty good special effects. But, This movie also tries to stray away too much from its roots and you have to admit, It does get quite tiring after a while of seeing Jason jump in and out of different bodies when you'd wish Jason would just appear as himself again [Which he doesn't do again until the final 10 minutes of the movie]. This is certainly the darkest, Most violent, Most bloodiest movie in the series. You will see a huge gorefest in this movie as well a very high body count. This movie also features probably some of the sickest murders ever thought of for a Jason movie. This movie also features plenty of topless, nude females [That probably will make many guys glad to sit through this]. This is also the first Jason movie to be handled by New Line Cinema instead of Paramount. You can tell New Line handled this very differently from Paramount [The dvd treatments of the New Line Jason movies are far better than Paramount's treatments of the first 8 movies and New Line's Jason movies are darker than Paramount's Jason movies]. I think this movie deserved a better reputation than what it's gotten over the years, Cause after all, This movie far surpasses most entries in the series that came before this. I say this movie deserves a chance. Again, Like part 4 years before it, This promised to be the final entry in the series.

It's like a the worst thing that could happen to a franchise, a sequel that disregards every canon rule in the book but still makes a decent movie out of it.

Jason Goes to Hell is quite a misleading title, maybe not.  Jason does go to hell, but it's a lot slower than most of us hoped.  This movie sure does send Jason to hell but not because of anything on the screen.  It's quite entertaining, but breaking every rule of the Friday the 13th series is no way to properly end one of the most enduring characters in cinema history.

New Line, who had just bought the rights to the series, decides to do away with what made Jason work (for the most part) and put out what they hoped people would respond to.  No, it doesn't work, but the entertainment factor runs high.  The acting is abysmal but the premis is enjoyable.

I do not recommend this DVD.  It adds nothing to the Friday the 13th lore, but it's at least not the worst in the series.",1189036800,,1106,4.204761904761905

685909,1,6303579396,"At this point in the Friday the 13th series we really have some bad movies, but Jason Goes to Hell manages to be the worst on in my eyes.  It was released four years after part 8 and was not distributed by Paramount Pictures.  The title is of course as dishonest as the third sequel, The Final Chapter.  Jason Goes to Hell was marketed as the final film and it wasn't.

Jason is back inexplicably and completely ignorant to his trials in that New York sewer, when he was evidently transformed back into a young boy.  He apparently decided instead to stick with the decayed zombie look indefinitely.  Jason chases a girl through the woods but he has been lured into a trap and is blown to smithereens by some FBI guys.  All of his parts are brought to a morgue.  The guy at the morgue decides it might be a good idea to begin eating Jason's heart.  This of course means he is possessed by Jason.  Jason's demon form is a fake looking snake with fangs and so forth and he goes from one host to the other, all the while killing folks.  Then we find out through some fancy pretentious poetry by this really cheesy bounty hunter guy that Jason can be killed by a fellow Voorhees.  Through this fortunate coincidence and for the benefit of a heavy handed death for Jason, our completely forgettable heroes managed to stumble upon a Voorhees.  Meanwhile, we don't care.  Jason dies and goes to hell, or just into the ground.  His hockey mask remains but Freddy Kreuger's clawed hand takes it into the dirt with them both.

For horror fans there are two references to other classics besides the obvious Nightmare on Elm Street tie-in.  One being ""the Myers place"" mentioned in some dialogue and the other being the unlikely appearance of the Necronomicon from the Evil Dead movies.  If you're a hardcore fan of these movies and need to see or even own part 9, then I wouldn't recommend anything other than the unedited version.  It includes a great murder scene that could not have been shown with an R-rating.  Other than that this movie is awful.",1185321600,5,2040,4.506811989100817

I have owned all of the films on VHS, bought the individual DVD's as they came available, and broke down and bought the box set when it first appeared just for the meager extras that were included. I love these movies. With that said, I only recommend ""Jason Goes to Hell"" if you are a completist and need the entire series on DVD. It's no wonder it took a decade after this film for ""Jason X"" to come out, as New Line nearly killed the series here. Fans of the series go to these films for basically one reason....to see Jason do his slasher thing with a forest full of annoying kids. That's it, we don't need a deep plot, we don't even really need an explanation of how Jason is resurrected once again, just have him show up and start chopping in more imaginative ways. So why New Line decided to launch their version of a Friday the 13th film where Jason is only in two scenes makes no sense at all! The plot of this film is a direct rip-off of a flick called ""The Hidden"", but intstead of an alien body-jumping, we get an evil worm thing. To top it all off, while this is a gory flick at times, it is also a very talky flick. The body count is pretty low until the last 15 minutes or so, and by then it's too late to try and save this thing. I see other reveiwers lumping this flick in with ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"", and while I understand their reasoning, I say New Beginning at least keeps the action moving with a HUGE bodycount and at least tries to capture the flavor of a ""Friday"" movie, ""Goes to Hell"" does not. I can see myself popping this thing in every 5 or 6 years or so, just because it's so forgettable I won't remember why I haven't seen it in so long...only to be reminded again at a later date just why this movie collects so much dust sitting on my shelf.",1184544000,,1949,4.118110236220472

Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?!

On the other hand the story keeps moving and it doesn't make any less sense than Jason coming back from the dead time after time. I like the fact that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that it pays homage to other classic horror films. I also thought that the film was effective at creating suspense.

685936,2,6303579396,"Let's understand two things about slasher horror from the 1980's: first of all, they had a legacy of saturating their own market, and secondly, they were simple stories born out of the twilight of an ever changing world.

With this in mind, it would be easy to point out what is wrong with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday- however for the sake of time, it might just as well be easier to point to what's right about it. The answer to that is: NOTHING! All you ever wanted to know about Jason is revealed, and once you know the dark secret, it will haunt you- except for a small matter of cosmetics, the ""dark secret"" is the same as the lemon revealed a short time earlier in New Line's bad ""finale"" to the Nightmare movies. Of course, the only nightmare about that film was having to admit that you paid to watch it- much the same with this piece of total garbage.

Jason, it would seem, is not merely a specter capable of regeneration with a great rage at those who he feels are responsible for both his own and his mother's demise. Oh no, the dark secret is that if you can find someone who shares his father's blood line (cause lets face it, his mother was not born a Voorhees), then you can see Jason finally put to death, or you can see him re-born. Guess what happens here.

Except the rebirth is anti-climatic because he is nothing more than the same twisted mass of flesh that he was before he was blown apart by bombs and bullets at the beginning of the movie. And apparently genetics has a preference for certain types of clothing, and a certain mask because he is reborn with both.

In one laughable sequence, you would be forgiven for thinking ""Jason"" (or as I'd like to refer to him as...the Imposter) being reborn meant the world would end, however a mere 10 minutes or so after he was ""reborn,"" he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger (who were the camp counselors who ignored Jason as he died...some ancient Sumarian or Egyptian people or something? What's with the dagger that must be used? Why does it look like an artifact?) supplied to his niece (oh, this is a long story, and is too tedious and boring to go through right now) who finds the Linda Hamilton in her to terminate the 'terminator.' You'll be in for your just desserts if you think this repulsive piece of junk is worth even five minutes of your time. Of course, there is plenty of blood and gore (as the Friday films always seem to have), and there is also plenty to gross you out- but if you think or feel anything towards the horror icon that made these films successful, you ought to take a pass on this one.",1161043200,2,2616,4.365503080082136

There has always been quite a bit of talk about Jason Goes to Hell being 'the worst of the series.""

Not so I say. At least in my opinion.

This film is light years ahead of a couple of the other sequels that came before it (Part V and Part VIII.) It features more well-known actors than previous offerings, a precursor to the post-Scream relevance that is shown to the slasher genre. It also features what is at least trying to be adult characters and situations, instead of thrity-somethings acting as drunken, fornicating teens. Not that there is anything wrong with that.

It does borrow liberally from other pictures, such as The Hidden and The Thing somewhat.

Adam Marcus, the director, had lofty designs of bringing something fresh to the table. That plan got hampered in the production by having just a bit too little of Jason (a bit, not a lot, but a bit) as well as feeling a bit over blown in it's mythology. It is a film of great moments, but not necessarily of great over all arc. But at least it is not as bad as Parts V and VIII. Those films are over all bad, but without any great moments.",1160956800,,1145,4.331775700934579

685939,2,6303579396,"I can respect director Adam Marcus for trying to pull away from the series and do something different, but we already had the BS Ft13th movie: Part V.  Jason wasn't the killer.  Technically, Jason is the killer in this movie, but it's not really.  You'll see what I mean when you see the movie, and it is worth a see, but by the 7th or 8th movie, they were movies for the fans.  They stopped making them to be innovative by the 5th movie and were just making them to make money and entertain the audience.  Adam Marcus wanted to be innovative with Jason Goes to Hell, and it doesn't work.  Not for fans or an average audience.  There's nothing interesting about seeing random people who act like Jason walking around and killing people, not to mention WITHOUT the trademark machete.  They could've at least given these people a little personality with the machete, but whoever called that one thought they were doing the series a favor.  The introduction of Jason having a sibling, niece, and now a great niece (I think?) by the 9th movie in the series is a little too late, sorry.  We would've had to know about these people by at least the 3rd or 4th movie to make us care about their struggle.  Another thing:  Jason as a snake/demon creature crawling around the floor?  Hmm... I wasn't under the impression that Jason was really evil in the first place.  Let me explain:  Jason has been made out to be mentally/physically disabled.  If Ginny in Part 2 was able to convince him that she was his mother by wearing her sweater, than Jason isn't evil at all, he just loves his mom and kills all the victims because he believes that they're responsible.  So, Jason as a wierd little hell creature doesn't necessarily work when bringing it into the context of the other movies.  The design of Jason's actual appearances in the movie doesn't make sense either.  What happened between part 8 and 9 to get his mask somehow buried and melded into his face?  Why does he look fat?  Where did his hair come from?  At least Part 8 had some respect for the look and personality of Jason, while it might not have been the best in the series it was at least satisfying to see him the way we know him, and not make drastic changes which don't even benefit his appearance.  Adam Marcus, I can respect you for trying to make your own movie, and yeah, it's definately yours.  Don't try and make your own movie the 9th movie in a series of movies that are about the fans, and don't BS the fans with your idea of an improvement of the series.

I'd say, fans should see this movie just to see it.  It's worth the view and the surprise cameo at the end.  *wink*",1152057600,3,2641,4.402892561983471
685940,4,6303579396,"I know some previous reviewers pointed out some glitches to this 9th chapter. (1. We don't know how Jason came back after the end of Part 8. 2. Jason has a sister in this movie even though in Part 1 his mother said he was an only child. 3. Jason supposedly can only be killed by a certain party, even though we know Tommy Jarvis killed Jason in Part 4.)

Well, if you raised these complaints, you were right. But the truth is, if people are willing to pay to see sequels, the industry will do what it has to do to create another chapter, and it really doesn't care about cheating. (Look how ""Halloween 4"" brought back Michael and Dr. Loomis even though they should have died in a hospital fire. But they cheated because people wanted another chapter.)

Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I think Part 1 was pretty good; part 2 had it's moments; I didn't much care for Part 3; part 4 had its good points and introduced Tommy Jarvis; part 5 was surprisingly good and focused on the aftermath of survivor Tommy Jarvis; part 6 remains my favorite one for soundtrack, well done scenes, and a surprisingly well written script; part 7 was arguably the most boring and worst chapter; part 8 was slightly better than part 7.

Onto the subject at hand. The opening scene gives us something new. We see Jason blown to bits, and we are wondering how even Jason will come back from this. (But since this is the 1st scene we obviously know he will do it somehow.) Good suspense. Soon we learn that Jason has the ability to inhabit other bodies when he (with some nice effects and musical touches) 'borrows' the coroner's body. Jason then continues his killing spree. As Jason does this, we learn that Jason has a surviving sister, niece, and once removed niece.

Also, we meet Mr. Duke. Duke explains that Jason has the ability to jump into other bodies, that he knows the way to destroy Jason, and will do so for a price. One interesting thing is that we learn that Jason can't stay in any one body long before he must seek a new one. We are allowed some time to wonder why before Duke gives us the answer. Besides telling us the way Jason can be destroyed, Duke also explains to us that Jason will eventually need to make use of some Voorhees woman to get his own body back.

Now I know some people complained that we don't get to see Jason on screen too much, but let's be fair. We all know (possibly through the good acting of the borrowed bodies) who Jason is. 2nd, it offers some new twist in that the other characters don't know at first who Jason is, and in one well drawn scene even we the audience don't know. 3rd, rather than just wondering how many people will get killed before (providing if) Jason is stopped, we are in suspense as to whether Jason will somehow manage to get his own body back.

Overall, there is good suspense, some good laughs, decent character development, some new twists, and action that is not so overdone. While Part 6 will always be the best to me, this chapter was surprisingly good.",1151107200,4,3019,4.391771019677996

I guess after having had the rights to the first eight 13th movies they got a little tired of this franchise. The movie starts out at Crystal Lake which makes no sense at all since last time we saw Jason was in New York. But I guess he bought an airline ticket or simply flew back. But I guess being un-dead he could have walked all the way home also. The script is downright awful and the dialogue is even worst. I wish I could give it 0 stars but since this option is not available I am forced to give it one. Which frankly is one too many. The acting is some of the worst acting I have seen in a long time and is right up there with the classic movie Malibu bikini shop. The special effects are downright shoddy and look cheap even for a 1993 movie.  The dialogue is downright awful and is filled with many clichs and this looks just like a cheap made for TV movies. Then again this is the ninth movie in the seemingly endless Friday the 13th series so they probably did not have that much money to spend on it. Watch it only if you are a super die hard Friday the 13th fan series, otherwise this turkey of a movie can be totally avoided.

Part 3 had the 3D gimmick. Part 4 had Senior Voorhees being offed by a 10 year old. Part 5 had the copy cat killer. Part 6 had the resurrection (unlike the other movies, he was actually buried). Part 7 had the ""Carrie"" copy cat. Part 8 took us out of the woods and into the city which brings us to Jason Goes To Hell. This movie shows us Jason the body hopper and hints at his eventual pairing with another horror movie icon from the '80s.

The movie opens with Jason stalking another screaming female through the woods ready to do what he does best. Ah but not this time oh Minister of Death. The unsuspecting Jason has been lured into a trap and 3 minutes into the movie, he's blown to smithereens. Case closed, everyone can go home. Not so fast. In the words of the great James Brown, ""Jason's got a brand new bag"". You see, destroying his body barely slows him down. The heart still pumps and apparently looks quite appetizing to one particular person who's performing an autopsy as he takes a huge chomp on the Lord of Lethal's heart. That chomp turns into one huge overgrown leech that inhabits the body of anyone within arms distance. Once the parasitic Jason has used a body to its full potential, it finds someone else to act as host. All of this is learned by the exboyfriend (ex husband maybe, I don't know) of a member of the Voorhees family (and the way he was informed was quite painful). It turns out that Jason will need to continue swapping bodies until he can get into the body of a family member. In this movie, there are 3. A mom, her daughter and the daughter's child. Because of his body swapping ways, the characters in the movie have a hard time determining which body is carrying Jason (though it's something the audience can easily discern because the hosts all act like lumbering zombies from ""Night Of The Living Dead). We get to see Dr. Voorhees and Officer Voorhees amongst other hosts.

While I do enjoy this movie, it's been a while since I've seen it and oddly enough, I don't remember any of the kills so they must not have been too impressive. Also if I'm not mistaken, this is the only movie in which Jason is the murderer where we don't get to see his face. That's one of the things fans of this series have come to expect. Did they run out of ideas? Another thing I didn't like is once Jason actually finds one of the 3 family members, he enters her in a rather tasteless way. The movie makes up for it once the inevitable Jason death occurs. The way the death occurs isn't anything new but the effects are pretty good and then we see the great submerging of Jason and the legendary submerging of the famed hockey mask.

Overall: Good edition to the series.",1150329600,,2861,4.404536862003781

685944,2,6303579396,"To be pleased by this film would mean that you never saw the first 8 and know nothing about Jason Voorhees. Here are the biggest fumbles of the film (possible spoilers):

1. They never explain how he got back to the Jason we all know and love or how he got back to Camp Crystal Lake (if you remember in part 8 he was turned back into a child by a wave of toxic waste in a New York City sewer). In the first 8 installments of the series they always explain how he came back to life, no matter how ridiculous and implausible the circumstances were.

2. Jason now has a sister, even though in the first film his mother says he was an only child.

3. We learn that Jason can only be killed or reborn by the hands of a Voorhees woman. In part 4 Tommy Jarvis kills jason and in part 6 Tommy Jarvis accidently brings him back to life.

Not only does this film ignore every other installment, but it doesn't even deliver on the Jason front. There's maybe 10 minutes of classic hockey mask wearing Jason action, the rest he's inhabiting the bodies of others and it just doesn't work.

Any good in this movie? Yes. KNB FX did a great job on the gore. I'd go so far as saying it's some of the best looking gore in the entire series. Also, watch out for references to other horror films including Evil Dead, Creepshow, and A Nightmare On Elm St.",1149811200,,1333,4.171206225680934

So, this time the FBI are called in, intent on killing Jason once and for all. Isn't it funny how it took the government 11 years to set up the operation??  Setting of Camp Crystal is once again revisited with an added bonus of the Voorhees house.  A sting operation is set up and Jason is blown to bits by the FBI.  However Jason is not really dead, oh no, his spirit still lives on.  The coroner after completing an autopsy suddenly becomes possessed by his heart by eating it! And so, the film runs through with a lot of body hopping.  The writers tried to give this plot some credibility by introducing the idea that Jason did have a sister ('Jason was my only child')  Remember Mrs. Voorhees statment in the first?

Jason is barely in the movie.  When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening.

Third, you get the feeling that this is the first time the filmmakers are actually in on the joke... as in every horror movie, the couple that has sex is 'punished' but in this movie, there's even an amusing scene where, right before Jason kills them, he steps on the condom that the guy tossed out of the tent- so much for safe sex!

685979,3,6303579396,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.

Okay, I admit it. I actually have a soft spot for Friday the 13th films (well some of them at least). While none of them could ever be called truly great cinema (actually most of the films are downright awful), being a horror fan and self professed gore-hound I've always liked watching the franchise's undead mascot Jason Vorhees slice and dice his way through some really dumb and oversexed teenagers.

But by the 6th and 7th installments, the evil MPAA was cutting almost all of the ""good stuff"" out of these movies to get an R rating as to where there wasn't really a point of watching them if blood and gore was what you were wanting to see. Then, the 8th film literally ripped off all of the fans by calling itself Jason takes Manhattan and then sticking him on a boat on his way to Manhattan killing off the teenagers on board for 3/4 of the film. He didn't even get to Manhattan until the last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie and even then, almost all of the action took place in back-alleys to disguise the fact that the Vancouver was substituting for New York (with the exception of a couple of cheesy Times Square shots).

When New Line studios bought the rights to the Jason character (but not the Friday the 13th name, hence the title of this film and the title of Jason X) from Paramount during the early 90's and announced they were making yet another Friday the 13th film, I cringed. But when Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (or Friday the 13th Part 9) was released in theaters (in heavily edited R-rated form) my friends and I went ahead and saw it telling ourselves over and over that it couldn't be any worse than part 8.

While I applauded New Line for trying to do something different with the franchise, I wasn't sure if what I had just witnessed was truly a Friday the 13th film. In an interesting twist, the makers of this movie basically acted like the last few movies didn't exist and literally rewrote the whole mythology of Jason Vorhees. In the prior movies they presented him as just pure evil that could not be stopped no matter what methods the protagonists tried to use. It was pretty much a simple case of him just being an unstoppable killing machine and nothing more.

In Jason Goes to Hell, we learn the ""reason"" why Jason keeps coming back. Turns out that his heart is actually some sort of parasite/demon that enters unlucky people through their mouths (unwittingly of course!), and takes over their body using it to do various highly questionable things (in this case killing numerous people in grotesque and gory ways). Kind of like Invasion of the Body Snatchers to a certain degree. Whenever the current body gets too beat up due to extensive gunshot wounds or other inflicted mayhem, the parasite simply exits the host's mouth and goes into someone else's mouth to take them over pretty much against their will and continue on its merry murderous way.

Sound familiar?!!! Of course it should. This plot is directly ripped off from the 1987 cult-classic The Hidden, only in this case they don't make any mention of the parasite being from outer space (though I was seriously waiting for that plot element to be introduced at any moment given the movie's everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach of referencing other horror films). In this film, it's just some sort of unexplained demon. There also aren't any extra-terrestrial detectives trying to track it down either though we do get a bounty hunter named Creighton Duke who has made it his life's mission to track down and kill Jason. (this plot element always amused me. He knows where Jason is at which is Camp Crystal Lake. It's not like Jason is going around the country killing people).

The film starts out in a familiar setting, a camp ground where a very attractive young woman is just arriving at a secluded cabin. There's the obligatory scene of her having to go out to a shed to get a new lightbulb to replace one in the house and her being scared by the door suddenly closing and other creepy sound effects. After fixing the light, she goes upstairs to take a shower and remove most of her clothes (always required in a horror film such as this) when the power suddenly gets cut (of course). Alarmed she goes out and is attacked by Jason. While running through the woods with Jason chasing after her (actually make that walking after her and still managing to stay right on her heels), she all of a sudden jumps in a clearing. A bunch of spotlights get cut on and a swat team of sorts descends out of the trees and proceeds to fill Jason with about 200 bullets (give or take a few). Then some sort of explosive device is lobbed his way blowing him to smithereens with a shot of his heart laying on the ground slowly stopping beating. Turns out the girl was nothing more than bait to lure Jason out in the open. But then we get a shot of some mysterious black man in the woods who utters the prophetic words ""I don't think so"" and then the opening credits begin.

At this point I'm not going to try to summarize any more of the plot since the film just gets more and more complex and confusing and some truly screwy things happen that had me going ""WHAT?!!!""

An early scene involves a coroner eating Jason's heart(!) after it somehow takes over his mind and he gets taken over by Jason's evil spirit. The black man I mentioned earlier is a guy named Creighton Duke who is some sort of bounty hunter who has been following and trying to kill Jason for years. We also learn that Jason had a sister who is still alive and that somehow if the evil parasite can infiltrate the body of a Vorhees, Jason can be reborn. Creighton Duke tries to warn her about what's going on and of course she thinks that he's nuts.

Lots of non-sensical body hopping ensues and the movie has a finale in which Jason finally makes a return in his true form and we learn that he can only be killed by a ""magic dagger"" that has to be handled by a Vorhees to put Jason back where he belongs.

Keep in mind that all of this is brand new and has absolutely nothing to do with the other Friday the 13th films. I've heard of filmmakers trying to reinvent a franchise but this borders on ridiculous at times.

But if you take this movie out of the Friday the 13th context, it actually is decent fun in a really goofy gory sort of way. The acting varies from decent to unintentional camp. The cinematography and direction is actually quite a bit better than we are accustomed to seeing in a Friday the 13th film. Plus, the fact that this one actually attempts to have a plot is a big advancement for this franchise.

The main star of this movie though is the extremely over the top gore effects by the renowned KNB effects team. Throughout the course of the film we are treated to:

1) Jason getting blown to smithereens by some sort of non-sensical explosive device in super gory detail.

2) A coroner chowing down on Jason's black heart in gruesome close-up shots including the coroner barfing up a nasty black substance.

3) A girl getting stabbed and ripped in half while right in the middle of having sex with her boyfriend (she's on top in case you were wondering). Her boyfriend's head is squashed off screen.

4) Brains/gore exploding out of the top of a woman's head after having her head severely squeezed by the killer. This comes after a double impalement of sorts.

5) 2 guys having their heads smashed together.

6) a man slowly melting and basically coming apart (one of the f/x highlights of the film IMO). The shot of the writhing body with its intestines strewn beneath it is bloody good stuff.

7) one of the cops gets his head partially decapitated

and there are still many more graphic gun shot wounds, stabbings and various impalements all shown in super graphic detail.

There is also the prerequisite female nudity (along with a male backside for the ladies) that is expected in this kind of film. What would a Friday the 13th films be without some fine bare breasts? ;)

The recent DVD release of this film contains both the R and unrated versions of the film. The 88 minute R rated version runs about 3 minutes shorter than the 91 minute unrated cut and is definitely not the one to watch (though it is interesting to see how the MPAA can butcher a film). The unrated cut has all of the uncut gore sequences. (The sex scene in the tent is also about twice as long featuring some explicit shots/angles not presnt in the R-rated cut). Both versions are on the same side of the disc and are selected after choosing the ""play movie"" menu selection. Both versions are present in the film's original 1.85:1 matted theatrical ratio and the film looks pretty good though some of the nighttime shots have sort of a washed out look to them in regards to the black levels.

In regards to extras, New Line has done their typical great work supplying worthwhile extras to a film that most people would think didn't deserve it. First off is one of the best (and funniest) commentary tracks that I've ever heard featuring the director and the main writer. They both realize that this movie can't be taken seriously on any level and they strike a great balance between offering interesting tid-bits about the making of the movie while also making cracks at the movie's ludicrous plot. This was their first feature film and they make no apologies for the movie that they unleashed onto the masses. They both say that they are huge fans of the Friday the 13th films and they were just trying to take this movie in a completely different direction. There is never a dull moment in the track and it's just great fun listening to these 2 guys have a blast watching this movie for the first time in years. (An interesting fact is that they both actually kind of prefer the censored R-rated cut as they claim in some respects that it's more suspenseful.)

There are also about 12 minutes of deleted scenes that were only present in the edited T.V. version shown on TNT. These scenes are mainly just talky stuff though it is worth checking out just to hear how they replaced the curse words with overdubbed T.V. replacements like ""friggin'"" and ""frig"". The DVD also has the usual selection of trailers and I was particularly impressed by the nifty animated menu screens.

But the best feature is called the ""Jump to a Death"" feature. You can bring up a menu of every death scene in the movie and clicking on one of them takes you directly to that scene. While some may frown on this feature as being in pure bad taste, at least New Line acknowledges the majority of people are just going to skip to the gore scenes anyway after sitting through the whole film once.

I'm kind of torn on my rating for this movie. While it's not a great movie by any means, it does do what it sets out to do which is gross out people and provide a few legitimate scares. On one hand it's easily the most ambitious Friday the 13th film to date (that is until the awful Jason X was unleashed in theaters 9 years later) but Jason really is only in the movie for the first few minutes and the last 10 or so minutes of the movie. Yes it does have a plot but it is so unbelievably goofy and confusing at various points in addition to having absolutely nothing to do with the prior films in the series. Now granted, none of these movies have had Oscar worthy scripts but when the 8th film ends with Jason reverting back to his youthful form in a sewer from the toxic sewage of New York (don't ask......) at least the prior films established some sort of continuity that this film completely throws by the wayside.

But on the whole, I enjoyed the movie. If you love really well done gore effects and extreme levels of brutal violence this movie is worth checking out. While a lot of people will be turned off by how mean and vicious this movie is, horror fans will eat it up. If you are a fan of the first 8 Friday the 13th films, this movie will more than likely do nothing but infuriate. But taken as its own movie, Jason Goes to Hell does deliver enough of the goods to be worthy of a rental one weekend when you're hanging out with your friends and downing some beers.

On the plus side however, Kane Hodder returns as Jason (what little we see of him) and as this release is of the unrated version, boasts some of the series most gory killings. But is really one for completists and die hard fans of the series only.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) has returned for the ninth time. But as soon as he starts off his intended killing spree around Crystal Lake, it's cut short by the F.B.I. who unhesitatingly blow him to smithereens. However, it's not so easy to keep old Jason down. Jumping from body to body, the spirit of Jason travels back to his old stomping grounds in an effort to find a Voorhees relative so he can be reborn through them. So how does this film stack up to the other eight in the long running series? Not well, I'm afraid. For starters, Jason is not the Jason we remember. Though Hodder is back behind the make-up and the mask, Jason seems almost smaller and less imposing than he was in previous films. Screen time for the actual Jason is extremely limited to the beginning and end sequences of the film, as most of Jason's killing is done while his spirit resides in other people's bodies. One of the worst moves this film made was introducing the voodoo angle. It's far too late in the series to be introducing new concepts such as that into the formula. At this point, it feels more like a joke or a flailing gimmick that the filmmakers used because they couldn't come up with anything else to breathe life into an exhausted story. The best part of this movie resides in its cast members and the interactions they have with each other...excluding Jason's presence. John D. LeMay is perfect in his role of Steven Freeman. He's the first truly memorable leading man the ""Friday"" franchise has even seen, it's just a shame the movie he starred in couldn't be as memorable as his performance. Steven Williams is a marvel to behold as bounty hunter Creighton Duke, bringing humor, guile and a little bit of uncertain malevolence to his role. He also plays off LeMay expertly. The scene they share in the prison is the best non-Jason moment of the entire series. LeMay also shares a hilarious scene with Kipp Marcus as Officer Randy Parker on the side of a dusty road at night (which is even better in its full length version in the alternate scenes segment of the special features). Kari Keegan is nice as Jessica Kimble but she doesn't really have the strength to play such a demanding and ultimately heroic role. The best supporting role resides with Steven Culp as tabloid reporter Robert Campbell, who only truly shines after Jason takes over his body. He presents the exigent villainy to pull off such a performance. It's disgraceful that such a solid cast and such intimate character developments were sandwiched into the screenplay of such a wasted excuse of a sequel. Their characters at least come off as believable representations. Our friend Jason doesn't fare so well. Take a logical look at the finale of the film and tell me...how wholly unbelievable is it that Jason is reborn with his famous hockey mask intact? Trivia buffs take note: when this film was first released theatrically (and on videocassette), it was known by its full title of ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"". When it was released to DVD in the new millennium, ""The Final Friday"" was removed from the cover, although it still appears in the opening credits of the film. First time ""Friday"" director Adam Marcus plays Officer Bish in the film. Another bit of information is that Kane Hodder not only played Jason Voorhees in the film, but he did stunt work and was the stunt coordinator for the movie as well. You also get to see Kane Hodder out of make-up during the first few minutes of the film as he plays one of the guards protecting the federal morgue where they take Jason's body. Horror afficionados might want to take a closer look at the book Steven finds in the old Voorhees home. It's the actual copy of the Necronomicon used in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Was that a suggestion of another possible movie-meets-movie spin-off a la ""Freddy vs. Jason""? I can see it now...Ash vs. Jason! In a final trivia note, John D. LeMay might look familiar to true ""Friday"" fans. That's because he played Ryan Dallion, one of the two co-stars, on ""Friday the 13th: The Series"". Overall, this might have been a four and a half star film if the producers only had the foresight to transmogrify it into something original. There's no place for occultist fantasies such as these in the ""Friday the 13th"" canon. The three stars this film wound up earning came from the quiet character interaction scenes and the tremendous amount of bloodshed the film displays. Those seeking true Jason terror need not apply.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.85:1 widescreen presentation is clear, realistic and free from grain. The 5.1 surround sound is without a doubt the best that has graced a ""Friday"" film. New Line Cinema has given every effort to ensure this is a visually and aurally pleasing film for the devoted horror connoisseur. There's also a DTS surround soundtrack, a 2.0 stereo surround soundtrack and English subtitles. Subtitles are a brilliant white in color, they're very easy to read and they have been placed within the frame of the film itself. The front cover is an almost direct lift (minus ""The Final Friday"" moniker) from the original videocassette release which finds a new silver hockey mask being inundated with a ghastly, serpentine creation on a flaming backdrop. The back cover is a well-suited representation of the film while the one sheet insert features four photographs and the twenty chapter stops for this ninety minute (unrated) movie. There are a few good special features on this disc beginning with the ""R"" rated version of the film (1:27:39) which might make for an interesting comparison for those who want to waste their time with an edited redaction of the film...I didn't bother with it myself. There's also a ""Jump to the Death"" sequence which allows you to navigate directly to your favorite kill scene. Added to that, there's nine scenes cut from the television version of ""Jason Goes to Hell"". The television scenes are presented in 1.33:1 full screen and some are patently edited for TV, but they all should have been restored in the DVD version of the film as they fit well and present more character development. The scenes include ""Diner Scene"" (3:32), ""Prank Phone Call"" (2:34), ""Cuffing Steven"" (0:16), ""Introduction Scene"" (0:34), ""Giving Vicki the Baby"" (0:53), ""Vicki and David"" (1:05), ""Vicki Gets to Work"" (0:33), ""Alone in Jessica's House"" (1:45) and ""Steve and Randy's Fight"" (1:22). There's also the original theatrical trailer (1:11) which tries to draw the viewer in but doesn't really succeed in doing so. To top it all off, there's a commentary track from director Adam Marcus and screenwriter Dean Lorey (only on the unrated version of the film). The commentary track itself gets four stars and is perhaps more entertaining than the actual movie. Both participants jump from one topic to the next with a lot of energy and enthusiasm, obviously having fun recording the track. It alternates between two separate feelings. Sometimes it feels like a comedy routine, sometimes it's like listening to two adolescents watching the horror movie. They make mention of the ""original"" concept for the film (""Jason Takes L.A."") and the seven minute rule that illuminates the ""Friday"" formula. They weigh the pros and cons of their outrageous gore effects and they touch on why they feel the MPAA is a necessity for American audiences. They also add uniquely personal stories such as Erin Gray's MILF moment and the surprising connection between ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and the first ""Die Hard"" movie (both films share a recurring police officer). All in all, this track is a prime example of why movie fans love audio commentaries.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: New Line has included a number of special features on this disc, so there was no reason to add additional hidden material. You're more likely to resist eating Jason's viscous black heart than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: In the opening scenes, Agent Elizabeth Marcus (Julie Michaels) bares her tight buns and also gives the orgiastic viewer a peek at her supple breasts. During the camping sequence we're allowed to see Alexis' (Kathryn Atwood) gorgeous breasts as she changes shirts outside. We then get to see Debbie's (Michelle Clunie) magnificent breasts when she has her tent rendezvous with Tony ""the wonder llama"" (Michael Silver...though he's mysteriously listed as ""Luke, the boy camper"" in the end credits). Fetishists will be delighted to know that they have the opportunity to hear both girls urinate by the bushes. Later in the film, right before Jessica Kimble (Kari Keegan) takes a shower, we're given an exceedingly brief glimpse of her breasts in a black, lacy bra. Regrettably, she doesn't bare anything else during the shower itself. However, astute viewers will catch a glimpse of her thong-divided derriere when Steven (John D. LeMay) tosses her in the front seat of his car as they run from the Jason-possessed Robert Campbell (Steven Culp).

THE GORE REPORT: During the opening credits, the viewer has a few opportunities to see the blown apart corpse of Jason Voorhees close-up before the coroner (Richard Gant) decides to chow down on Jason's still beating heart (a true delight for gorehounds). Perhaps the best gore scene from any of the ""Friday"" films happens here when one of the female campers is sliced in half. In another utterly gruesome sequence, when Jason transfers his spirit from Officer Josh (Andrew Bloch) to Robert Campbell (Steven Culp), Josh's body goes through a horrific meltdown which should please fans of the disturbed and unusual. There are some other truly bloody moments in the film, making this the most gore-laden entry of the series. We're talking as close to Italian horror (think ""Dr. Butcher, M.D."") as a mainstream American-produced film had gotten up to that point.

SAY AGAIN: ""In my professional opinion, this guy's deader than sh*t."" - Bill the Coroner (Richard Gant).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. See it for the girls, see it for the gore, see it for the sarcasm, imagine it as a separate movie, just don't expect to see the Jason Voorhees you know and love...because he's nowhere to be found. If this film had been crafted around an all new psychopathic terror instead of the infamous Jason Voorhees, it would have been a more genuine, more creditable horror movie and it might well have wound up being a classic in its own right. As it stands, fright fans can only wistfully perceive what could have been and long for the true return of their favorite hockey-masked hellion.

He stalks a pretty young woman who turns out to be a plant to draw Jason out into the open!  Dozens of soldiers burst from cover and obliterate the infamous murderer.  Fret not, Jason fans, there's more!

A pathologist, while performing an autopsy on the fiend's body, suddenly decides it would be a good idea to eat Jason's heart, which allows Jason's spirit to possses his body.  The rest of the film, Jason's spirit switches from body to body as he tries to find his long-lost sister so he can take her body and be reborn as Jason (this is explained by some ticked-off prisoner, played by the guy who played X in The X-Files).  Jason can only be killed by his sister with a special knife stabbed into his heart.  Jason is reborn through his mother's (I think...I can't remember) body, and bursts through the floor like any respectable monster.  Of course he is stabbed, and as the predictably 2 remaining characters watch, he is dragged into Hell.

Watch clear until the end and be rewarded with a dopey in-joke.

New Friday owners New Line (who also finance The Lord of The Rings) decided to revamp this dog of a series by ignoring just about all of the previous entries, with varying results.  This is a mean movie that seems to hurt everyone who watches it (it's very painful).  Not to mention pointless.

686019,5,6303579396,"Friday nights have never been more terrifying and no one knows that better than Jason Voorhees and the residents of Camp Crystal Lake. Well, Jason is back to bring fear back into the hearts of Camp Crystal Lake's residents and you. In 1993, director Adam Marcus had given us, Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday, the ninth installment to the Friday The 13th franchise.

  It has been years since Jason Voorhees (again played by Kane Hodder) terrorized Camp Crystal Lake's high school seniors, while they were on a cruise to New York. Now, the FBI has taken this matter into their own hands, as FBI Agent Elizabeth Marcus (played by Julie Michaels) drives off to her beautiful cabin in Camp Crystal Lake. As she readies herself for a bath, Jason appears and chases her all through Crystal Lake's wilderness, until she reaches open ground, where her fellow agents appear and blow Jason to pieces.

  Jason's remains are taken to a nearby hospital, where a coroner (played by Richard Gant, who is famous is annoying role in Rocky 5), examines the remains of Jason. While he examines Jason's remains, the coroner suddenly finds Jason's heart beating. But how could that be? Jason is dead...right? In fear, the coroner stupidly picks up the heart and disgustingly eats a piece of it. The piece of the heart suddenly possesses the coroner, turning him into Jason. The coroner's assistant appears to help out, but Jason (possessing the coroner) kills the assistant, followed by the killing of the two FBI guards (played by Kane Hodder & Tony Ervolina) outside.

  The next morning, News anchorman, Robert Campbell (played by Steven Culp) gives a news report on the three grisly murders, as well as showing an interview he had held with bounty hunter, Creighton Duke (played by Steven Williams). Duke has requested that he be paid an amount of $100,000 after he finds Jason and kills him off for good. He has also revealed that Jason is now jumping in and out of other people's bodies, so he is setting out to kill him. Watching this is Diana Kimble (played by Erin Gray), the younger sister of Jason Voorhees. She is shocked to hear that her evil psychopath of a brother is still on the loose, but in the disguise of other people. Diana works as a waitress in a diner entitled, Joey B.'s. Joey B. (played by Rusty Schwimmer) is, obviously, the owner. Diana runs into Duke, who gives her some trouble. But Diana's boyfriend, Sheriff Ed Landis comes to her aid and arrests Duke. Diana sits next to Steven Freeman (played by John D. LeMay), the man who had dated Diana's beautiful daughter, Jessica Kimball (played by Kari Keegan). Diana tells Steven to drop by her house, where she'll reveal a secret to Steven. A secret about Jessica. Steven agrees.

That night, Diana arrives at home, after a brief conversation with, deputy Josh. She answers her ringing phone to hear Jessica's voice. Jessica is now a mother of a beautiful little daughter named Stephanie. She is now dating...Robert Campbell. Diana tries to convince her to talk to Steven, but Jessica is finished with him. As she talks, Josh appears behind Diana, but Josh is no longer Josh. Josh is now...Jason. As Diana tries to battle Jason, Steven appears and tries to help Diana, but Josh kills off Diana, leaving Sheriff Landis to arrest Steven, but Steven is good friends with Andy, who is also one of the patrol cops in Crystal Lake.

  Jessica returns home for her mother's funeral. At her mother's house, Jessica arrives to find Vickie, one of the waitress' whom Diana works with. Vickie agrees to babysit, while Jessica and Robert go out for the night, as Steven sits in a jail cell. Next door, Duke sits around, revealing information of Diana and Jessica's relationship to Jason Voorhees. He reveals that Jason was only born through a Voorhees, through a Voorhees can he be reborn, and through the hands of a Voorhees can he be killed. Steve gets out of jail and sets out to find Jessica. He heads for the Voorhees' house, where he finds Diana's body there, instead of in the morgue. Robert Campbell comes in. As he enters, Josh, still possessed by Jason. He passes on Jason's heart to Robert. Robert becomes possessed by Jason. Jason heads for Jessica, who is staying in mother's house. He is about to strike Jessica, but Steven appears and runs down Robert. Jessica bashes Steven in the stomach and heads out for Sheriff Landis' office. He makes sure she is safe, as some of the officers are giving Jessica a pair of pants to wear. But Jason appears and kills each cop in the building, just as Steven arrives. Jessica runs off with Steven to get their baby, who is with Vickie. Joey B. refuses to let Jessica and Steven see the baby, but Jason appears and kills Joey B and Vickie, forcing Steven to knock Jason out cold. Jessica finds that the baby is at the Voorhees' house with Duke. Jessica arrives and picks up her baby, as Duke tells Jessica everything. Andy arrives, possessed by Jason. He tries to put the heart through Jessica's baby, but Steven comes in and severs Andy's neck, where the heart, now a hell baby, climbs out and falls into the basement. It finds Diana's body and gets inside of it, forcing Jason to be reborn. Jason comes back in full tact and kills Duke. After a short battle, Jessica finally kills Jason and sends him howling back to hell. As Jessica and Steven resume their relationship with their daughter, Freddy Kreuger's glove reaches up and grabs Jason's mask.

  This may not be what you fans want, but it is most certainly a worthy follow-up to this terrifying Friday The 13th franchise.",1108857600,,5582,4.698055271238485
686050,5,6303579396,"Okay, first of all, to all you [...] that say there wasn't enough Jason scenes, [...]!  You guys are so pathetic!  We know what Jason looks like, because there had been eight movies before this one! Plus, a lot of people failed to see that there was a mirror in almost every death scene, and you could see Jason killing the person.
  Now onto the reasons why I give this movie 5 stars:  the writers FINALLY got creative with a Jason movie!  All eight prior to this was exactly the same practicaly, with the exception of part 5, 7 and 8 (two of those were not very good.
)  The writers got some balls, and said ""screw it, we're New Line Cinema, let's be original.""  Now I admit, the theatrical release wasn't that good, because it did what part 7 did- all the gore was cut out, which was not the filmaker's faults, because we all know that 7 was suppost to be the goriest of them all, but the censors intervened, just like with this one.  When the Uncut version was released of this movie, we got to see it in all of its gory glory.  The kill scenes are so cool in the uncut version you actualy react to the scenes, unlike part 8 where you are fighting to keep from yawning!
  The story itself has two sides to it: some say this was a rip-off of the body snatchers, and others say this was completely original.  I believe that this was original.  It actualy added depth, character develpment, and more of a plot.  Jason looked his best too, in my opinion better than part 7.
  Buy this DVD with confidence, because it has the Unrated and Theatrical Cut on one disc, but if you are like me you won't even attempt to watch the Theatrical Cut.",1102550400,4,1639,4.252427184466019
686051,5,6303579396,"This film puts Jason back in the Camp Crystal Lake area, where he is blown to pieces by the military.  But when his remains are taken away to the morgue, it soon transpires there is more to the serial killer than meets the eye.

Where this film stands up is in its original ideas, and its departure from the standard stalk-and-slash, which had become stale by this point.  It is revealed Jason has a long-lost sister who is the only person who can truly kill him.  The film has a few sex-mad teens, but thankfully they're only included as an in-joke.  The more interesting characters in this film include a bounty hunter who hunts serial killers for a living.  The touches of humour (businesses making cash out of the horrific, etc) are good, and the climax is genuinely spectacular.  Maybe it's not for die-hard fans of Jason (though he still does the killing, he spends most of the film using victims' bodies as vehicles), but I'd rate it as one of the best of this series.",1102291200,2,975,4.505681818181818
686052,4,6303579396,"Elizabeth Marcus (Julie Michaels) is being chased through the woods by Jason.  Typical Friday The 13th movie, right?  Wrong.  A bunch of bright lights flash on, startling Jason.  The FBI comes out of hiding and shoot Jason numerous times.  In fact, Kane Hodder, as Jason, had the most squibs ever on an actor.  Jason is then blown to smithereens, causing body parts to go flying.  It's a pretty cool opening sequence, but how are they going to finish the movie?

Jason's tattered remains are being examined by a professional.  The man is hypnotized by Jason's black heart so much so that he eats it (there's some interesting acting).  This brings the spirit of Jason into him.  He continues to go from body to body, searching for his living family members (his sister, his niece, and his niece's baby).  If he can get one of them to host his spirit, he will be reborn with into his old body, complete with mask and all.

He switches bodies multiple times throughout the movie, which is kind of cool.  The downside of this is that there aren't many scenes with Jason as Jason -- that is, Kane Hodder as Jason.  This is his third of four times playing Jason in a row.  Hodder does have a short appearance as an FBI agent, but he gets killed.

The ending is pretty lame with the 'heart creature' and the giant hands from Hell.  However, the sequence right before the credits is very exciting.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say that there's a very special cameo.

Aside from the cameo I just mentioned, there are some other interesting appearances.  The book in the old Voorhees house is the Book Of The Dead from the Evil Dead movies.  Additionally, the dagger used to kill Jason was the same daggeer used in Evil Dead.  This didn't have anything to do with the movie, but it was cool that they used the same props.

This movie leaves many unanswered questions.  Why does a movie titled Jason Goes To Hell never have a scene in Hell?  How did Jason come back from the ending of the eighth movie?  If the bounty hunter has been chasing Jason for his entire life, why doesn't he show up until the eighth installment?  How did he find out how to kill Jason?  More importantly, why is he even after Jason?  Why was Jason's family never mentioned before this?  Oh well, it's a movie.  It's bound to have some plot holes.

On the plus side, there is actually some character development here, which most Friday The 13th movies lack.  People are actually in relationships and have lives until Jason interrupts.

It was interesting to see how New Line went in a different direction with this film.  The didn't do the same 'campers getting killed in the woods' thing, although they did include a few camper deaths in the movie, which was a good idea on their part.  Let's face it: people complained about the lack of that, but if they would have done the same old plot again, people would have complained about it being boring and unoriginal.

The DVD is pretty good for this movie.  It has some cool special features.  One of those is the funny commentary from director Adam Marcus and screenwriter Dean Lorey, both of whom play small roles in the movie.  They poke fun and make jokes but also tell interesting facts, so it's entertaining.  Other features include alternate scenes from the television version, the original theatrical trailer, and jump to a death.  The only thing missing would be a cool 'making of' segment.

The best part about the DVD is that it contains both the R-rated version and an unrated director's cut.  The R-rated version is the one you saw in theaters.  It shows a lot of deaths off screen.  Sure, that adds a sense of mystery, but if you're a gore hound like myself, you'll want to watch the unrated version.  It has a lot of bloody deaths that were so bad, they couldn't be shown in theaters.  It's much better than the original, in my personal opinion.

It's not the Final Friday, as the title states, but neither was the fourth one, which claimed to be 'The Final Chapter'.  They will continue to make movies as long as they can get money out of it.  At least this one isn't a bad movie, like the next to come.",1100908800,24,4166,4.493991989319092
686053,5,6303579396,"""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"" shakes ""Friday The 13th"" foundations to their very core while remaining fully committed to and honoring all that has come before.  By far the most radical departure from form for the series, the chances the movie takes pay off in spades, providing possible alternate explanations for events in previous entries (for me, one route is especially obvious, but there are other possible ways of fitting the new developments in with the old as well) and generating one of the most surprising, shocking, and truly jaw-dropping movies in history.

  There is so much one could say about this movie, both in praise of its brilliance and in speculation as to various meanings, and yet so little one can say without risking giving away crucial plot points.  For example, the first major - and totally unexpected, if you've never seen or heard all about this movie - comes about 5 minutes in!  (This one is kind of given away on the movie's back description, as are a few too many other points)

  If you're at all interested in seeing this movie, I'd recommend getting it NOW and reading no further of this or any other review.  For the benefit of those who are still undecided, I'll say a bit more but endeavor not to give anything other than the earliest points any specific mention, and hereby disclaim:

  WARNING: THE NEXT LINES CONTAIN POSSIBLE INCOMPLETE SPOILERS TO THE MOVIE'S FIRST 20-25 MINUTES, BUT NO FURTHER.

  After finally being utterly destroyed in the opening minutes of the movie, with seemingly no credible way of ever coming back this time, 'Jason' does indeed return - in a mind-blowing, totally unforseen way that I doubt anybody could have ever predicted from seeing the first 8 chapters - and does so in short order and very convincingly, certainly feeling far less arbitrary than the opening sequence to ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" (incidentally, it's apparant that quite a bit of 'untold' events have transpired between the end of ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" and the beginning of ""Jason Goes To Hell"".  It remains to be seen whether these gaps will ever be filled in)  From here, it quickly becomes evident that Jason (with nary a hockey mask in sight for some time) is now different, no longer the emotion/instinct-driven but unthinking killing machine of ""Friday""s past; this new incarnation is sadistic, more aggressive than ever, and clearly shows intelligence.  The reasons for this dramatic change should become clearer when you see the film.

  An outstandingly made piece of cinema, possibly the best movie of 1993, epic, with some of the best special effects in film history, and the ending...!!  If anyone reading this hasn't heard how it ends do yourself a huge favor and see ""Jason Goes To Hell"" as quickly as possible - it's possibly the best surprise ending ever, even eclipsing movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", the original ""Planet Of The Apes"" and ""Halloween""; and still shocking even after multiple views.",1097884800,3,2968,4.903807615230461

686056,5,6303579396,"Review of the RATED AND UNRATED plus commentary  DVD:
This is a brilliant film. If you see the  UN-RATED version of this film, you will  see why the NC-17(so called) version is by far the superior  film.
And, listen to the commentary: the key reasons why everything is done is covered in detail.
I am amazed that some say that Jason does NOT  appear in this film. Yes he does... Jason's TRUE  nature does most definitely appear in this  film. The extension of the Mythos covers so much more than almost any other film. Things such as... the Hockey Mask only becomes iconic after film number 3, and the true nature of the body ""language""  that Kane Hodder  gave to Jason is explained. This is a film package for the fans ... some purists would eschew this side of the film/DVD  version in this package, but being able to see the two versions side by side and hear the enthusiasm of the film makers is totally  enthrallying; if you enjoy the series, you will, I believe, enjoy this package.
************************************

I enjoyed this film mainly  because it gave more material to the Mythos of Jason. It's also the principle reason why Kane Hodder works as the Best Jason( IMO).
The concept of Jason as a spirit who leaps from body to body is most likely stolen from SHOCKER ( By Wes Craven) rather than BODY SNATCHERS ( and shocker may have been stolen from who knows where).
The best element for me is that the story line clearly draws from much older Mythic  elements ... it adds some quality body to a character that needed fleshing out in the supernatural  realm.",1097107200,,1576,4.5587188612099645
686057,4,6303579396,As sort of a fan of the series I give kudos points to the writers and I respect that they wanted to lead the series into a different direction. To me this film was entertaining and the unrated version brought alot more gore and violence to the film. This is way better Jason in Manhattan. New Line Cinema did alot better job than Paramount did with parts 4 through 8. And this is the movie that leads up to Freddy Vs. Jason. If you are looking for something mre that campers having sex and dying then this is the film that brings the series back to life but then the series is then killed again by the horrid Jason X.,1095379200,,617,4.15
686088,3,6303579396,I though this was a good movie because jason takes on a mortal human form and in the movie he is desructable and that makes it a more root for the bad guy because he might actually lose. This movie actually gets into a more mystical type version and it goes into the legend and the hidden secret of how to kill him. but the down side is in some parts when you cant see his legs he moves a little faster than he really can also his head is slightly deformed and strangely bumpy. check out my reviews on the Halloween movies.,1094688000,,523,4.087378640776699
686089,3,6303579396,"It can be argued that once Paramount pictures put a cut to the Friday The 13th Series at Part VIII (Jason Takes Manhattan) that maybe we should have let sleeping dogs lie, however given recent releases on the big lug, it seems that Jason Goes To Hell was just a rough start.

The plot is new and inventive (which says something for this series!) but unfortunately it's also disappointing.  Jason is back at Crystal Lake and this time a SWAT team has decided to take him out once and for all (which they do in the opening scene).  Once in the morgue, Jason makes his way through bodies via nasty tentacles in their mouths, to find his way back to one of his bloodline to be reborn.  There are only three Voorhies bloodline left and they lie in the hands of two weak females and a small baby.  Does Jason have a chance, or will he end up in hell?

The worst part about this movie was definitely the plotline, in that it doesn't have Jason doing the killing!  Sure, it's his spirit that just wears a different body, but when you've seen what Jason looks like that can be a big deal!  There's a decent budget connected with the film, and although the acting is horrible, it isn't much worse than any of the other Jason films.  What I did like was that it still, with all its faults, stuck to the original idea of all the films before it: keep it gory and true fans will accept it.  That's exactly what I did.  This movie had some pretty impressive death scenes (especially in the unrated edition) and the blood and gore kept flowing.  Not of the best in the series, but definitely worth at least checking out for any Jason fan.

The DVD, unlike this installment, is quite impressive.  If Paramount had done with some of the better movies what New Line did with this one, you'd see those Friday The 13th sales skyrocket (and as I recently discovered, that wrong won't be made right by the soon to be released boxed set which in fact uses LESS features than the current releases, see my review)!  The movie contains both the R-rated and unrated editions (nudity buffs will be saddened to learn that I believe the unrated edition is purely due to gore), which is helpful because the unrated does lengthen the movie a bit and it can be argued that it may not be worth it (more importantly, I like the CHOICE of having BOTH).  It also includes the added scenes that were on the edited for TV version to complete any fans want to have EVERY scene.  Most importantly for me though, was the fact that this movie was presented in 5.1 DTS, 5.1 Dolby Digital, or 2.0 Stereo for non-surround sound systems.  Talk about going out of your way to make a pretty weak Jason film with the supra deluxe features!  The DVD is great, especially if you like this movie, and the movie ain't half bad itself.  My advice: if you haven't seen it, rent it, if you're a fan of Jason and found it decent, buy it!",1092096000,,2879,4.355805243445693

Amazon gave me this DVD at a nice low price. Thanks! Now, to the movie. Jason is tricked and blown up by the F.B.I. He is belevied to be dead, but he's evil spirt( which turns out to be a fake looking demon) goes to a diffrent body. Many murder's are commited by Jason, and every one now think he is alive again. The Boundy Hunter Duke says he knows how to kill Jason once and for all. He teams up with Jason's sister and her daughter, because only a blood reletive can kill Jason.

Sure people will won't agree with that, but you just need to wach the film for yourself and wach the old ones to see what I mean. I hate it when people say this is bad. Here are some complant's I have heard.
Jason jumps body's: So? It's trying to be scary, it's a horror movie. Do you think every horror film will be the same?
Jason's a demon: Well he alway's acted like a demon to me. He runs around killing people with a hockey mask on.
Jason has a sister: Hey his Dad left him, don't you think he got remarried?
Deleted secencs: I saw those sence, they were not a big deal. the Tree Trunk Demons looked fake.
They made a sequel: They made other movies with Jason in them but they never did another Friday film. Jason X does not have Friday the 13th in the title so it's not a Friday film.
Well that's it. You'll like this film if you liked the old ones. 80'S FAN'S REJOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1087516800,4,1690,4.078078078078078

I was really disappointed with this one even though my standards for Friday movies are extremely low. I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.
Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed. This one was really disappointed when I saw this and it isn't even worht the two star rating I gave it.",1085702400,,680,4.2384615384615385

686093,5,6303579396,"""Jason Goes to Hell"" takes a pleasant turn from cheesy slasher genre horror to an action movie. Starting off with an ultra-cool scene where a special FBI team blows Jason apart with bombs and machine guns, ""The Final Friday"" proves itself to be a worthy flick. The plot is relatively simple (I think it's been done before, but what the hell): Jason's body is gone so his soul goes into others' bodies and they turn into him. Like I said...simple.
There are a few parts where I was disappointed: I paid 7.50 to see this movie entitled ""JASON Goes to Hell""...yet Jason was in the movie for a maximum of ten minutes. I was cheering with joy when the big lug came onscreen with his machete in the first few minutes, and I was cheering again when he returned at the end.
Jason seems to have lost his superhuman strength, as well: I mean, what the hell? Jason could have snapped that guy in half at the end but instead just toys around with him by whacking him a few times with a stick and a shovel (you'll see what I mean when you watch it).
There are a few plot holes, too: are we really supposed to believe that Jason has been body-hopping for all this time? (Though that might explain what happened to Paul in Friday the Thirteenth Part 2).
Something that really actually pleased me when I bought the DVD was the gore factor! Check out the unrated version and see what REALLY happens to the girl in the tent. Instead of just a little spray of blood, the Coroner impales her and rips her in half vertically.
I was also really pleased with the actors and actresses: Steven Williams was PERFECT for the role as Creighton Duke! I love that guy! He's funny, creepy, and awesome all at the same time. John De LeMay as Steven was great, too: he did well as the unlikely hero. And, as always, Kane Hodder did his thing as Jason Voorhees (for what little screen time he had).
Some memorable scenes include the police station scene, the diner shootout, and, naturally, as our generation of movie-loving people has come to call ""the last 20 minutes"".
My personal favorite part was the ""finger-breaking scene"" where Duke is giving Steven information for a ""high-price"" where he breaks Steven's fingers. ""OH JEEZ!"" That or when Steven shoots Robert in the head and all his black blood-brains splatter the wall.
Oh, yes, and about that gore factor? Watch the scene where Josh melts (yeah, you heard me). Bloodpuppies won't be disappointed.
All and all I was very, very, very pleased with ""Jason Goes to Hell"". So grab some beer, some food, and some buddies, turn off the lights, and watch an action movie with laughs, gore, good T&A (meow for Kathryn Atwood!), and a machete.
Later skaters! Enjoy!

686094,4,6303579396,The last regular Friday the 13th movie (I don't count Jason X) had some good acting. In the begging of the movie it is gross. You see Jason's heart and blood which is black and a man eats the heart. eeww...but later it was awesome!,1080950400,,231,4.155555555555556
686154,3,6303579396,"Let's get one thing straight: In Jason Goes to Hell, Jason does NOT go to hell until the very end of the movie. Unless you mean, ""blown to hell,"" in which case he's blown to hell right at the beginning of the film. And that's sort of a summary of how Jason fans feel about this movie. You either love it for what it is, or hate it for what it tried to be.
The ninth in the series of Friday the 13th movies, this movie tries to explain why Jason's an unstoppable killing machine. Apparently, a weird little two-legged demon lives in his heart, making him unstoppable. Jason is finally caught in a trap by the FBI, who use a female decoy to lure him into an ambush. The FBI blows him to pieces. The End.
Well, not quite. The coroner examining Jason's remains is suddenly possessed by a strange urge to eat Jason's heart. That puts the demon into Mr. Coroner, who goes on a killing spree. He has but one goal: to reenter the body of another Voorhees. And Jason's sister is the first target.
""Through a Voorhees was he born... through a Voorhees may he be reborn... and only by the hands of a Voorhees will he die.""
What, you didn't know Jason had a sister (played by Erin Gray)? Surprise! And his sister had a daughter. And her daughter has a baby too, which ups the stakes.
This is perhaps the only movie to feature Jason the least, because, well he's just not Jason if he's not wearing a hockey mask and wielding a machete. Instead, this movie turns into a zombie flick.
There are other characters of little consequence, but some are entertaining. The town of Crystal Lake has definitely gotten used to Jason being around - one diner makes Jason-style hamburgers and everything on the menu has something to do with the renowned serial killer.
There's also Creighton Duke, played by Steven Williams. He's a bounty hunter who is hell-bent on destroying Jason. Why? Well, we're never given his motivation, although the audio commentary explains that Jason killed his girlfriend at Crystal Lake. Trust me, it doesn't impact the plot much either way.
As Jason hops from body to body, Steven Freeman, father of Jessica Kimble's baby, risks life and limb to protect her. The climactic battle comes to a head at the Voorhees home, where the Necronomicon Ex Mortis from Army of Darkness shows up. Why? Because the producers thought it would be cool.
When Jessica grabs what looks like an ordinary knife, it transforms into the spinal dagger from Evil Dead. Why? Because the producers thought it would be cool.
Jason eventually does get his body back, by hopping into the corpse of his dead sister, Diana Kimble. So it's up to Jessica and Steven to fight Jason to the death. Why? Because the producers thought - you get the idea.
This movie is a fan film. The producers were 23 years old at the time. The movie strives too hard to be original and only half succeeds, but it's a testament to how awful some of the other Friday the 13th movies were that it is still a better movie overall.
Listening to the commentary, it's obvious that once the franchise moved to New Line they were giving it to any punk who was willing to direct it. Ironically, this gave the movie a huge amount of freedom and latitude to be very daring in a way a more revered franchise could never be. And of course, that freedom gave us the ultimate joke: Freddy Kreuger's clawed hand pulling Jason's mask down into hell.
As the producers explained, it was a gag. They figured it was possible to have both villains face off since New Line owned the rights to both Jason and Freddy, but there were never any plans to film a movie between the two titans. Once that scene played, however, Freddy vs. Jason became a possibility.
So we owe it to a couple of kids for planting the seed that would eventually germinate into the superior Freddy vs. Jason flick. They get props from me for having the balls to stick into their movie. That, and the fact that two props from Evil Dead are in it.",1079913600,2,3944,4.479166666666667
686155,4,6303579396,"I cant say this is a superb must see movie. but it certinly had one hell of a suprise in the ending! Unless someone has spoiled it already, I won't ruein it for you... altho if you don't know by now, then what rock did you just crawl out from under where youve been isolated for 11 years?
The film kicks off with Jason just back in buisness! No explination as to how he has returned from New York but who wants to worry about those details? go to fridaythe13thfilms.com if you wanna debate about it!
Jasons back and in crystal lake stalking down his latest victom, this movie shows Jason has been all mutalated and almost mutant looking from all the toxic waste that we thought killed him in the last movie (Jason Goes To Manhatten for 15 Minutes)
Jason unexpectly runs into a bit of a sticky situation, as it seems the whole army is there stop him, and they blow him to smitherines! Jasons body is blown into peices.... but thats not how you kill him! Jasons spirit type demon keeps jumping into body to body and the only way Jason can truley be reborn is to be posses another blood relative of the Voorhees fammily! Along the way you get your typical misterious know it all to explain the plot but not explain how the hell he knows about it? and a few new twists in the Voorhees legacy! Will Jason be able to reserect himself? I'd say wait and see....but the fact that there beens 1 and a hlaf seaqulls since this, you should be able to put two and two together!
For the F13th fans this movie was the first for NEW LINE CINIMA and they really wanted to change the story of the typical F13th plot of just a slasher who kills campers, and they have succeeded in doing that with this intresting change of average plot and new Ideas!
A bit of corney acting here and there, but does anyone really ever watch a horror movie expecting an acadamey award winning effort? I don't think so? If your into the Jason legacy or slasher films, this ones one you have to see! As for buying it? I'd recomend renting first before you decide on that!",1079827200,,2032,4.308093994778068
686156,1,6303579396,"Yet another entry in the hoary ""Friday the 13th"" series, ""Jason Goes to Hell-The Final Friday,"" really had nowhere original to go. After sending our hockey masked anti-hero to New York where he seemed to finally perish after taking a dip in a toxic waste bath, the company who owned the rights to this franchise decided to sell their interest to New Line Cinema. The people responsible for running the Freddy Krueger/Nightmare on Elm Street series into the ground, New Line rubbed their palms together with glee as they contemplated all of the horrific ways they could do the same to Jason Voorhees. As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think how far this franchise has gone in its twenty-three years of existence. Who among us would have thought that a low budget film about a killer at a summer camp would achieve such longevity? Moreover, who thought it would encompass such bizarre plot elements as sending a killer into space or to the deepest pits of Hell? O.K., they did give us Leprechaun and Hellraiser in space, but still-JASON? Well, before they sent Jason into outer space, they ran him through the paces here on earth in this absolute abomination of a film. I actually liked ""Jason X,"" but this film, its immediate predecessor, stinks to high heaven. I wish I had never watched it.
The plot of ""The Final Friday"" is cerebral novocaine, a plot so brain meltingly banal that it took all of my energies just to get to the end. Jason, miracously recovered from his dissolution in toxic sludge, reappears at Camp Crystal Lake briefly before the FBI blows him to bits in a carefully laid trap. The remnants of Voorhees turn up at a federal medical center where some poor dolt doing the autopsy is suddenly overcome by the ""spirit"" of evil--or some such nonsense, I cannot remember if the film made it clear or not--and promptly devours Jason's black, still beating heart amidst messy sprays of gore and flesh. Once this guy eats the heart, Jason manages to possess his body and continue on his merry flesh rending ways. That's right, folks; Jason Voorhees can now move from body to body, and of course he heads right back to Camp Crystal Lake for more mayhem. Apparently, our hero cannot exist indefinitely in other people's bodies; he must find a blood relation to inhabit so he can reassume his familiar form. Confused yet? Don't worry. It gets much, much worse as the film progresses.
Enter Diana (Erin Gray), a waitress near Crystal Lake who, unbeknownst to her, is actually Jason Voorhees's sister. Diana has a daughter who happens to have a husband and newborn child, so blood relatives of Jason Voorhees are as thick as flies on honey around the man's old stomping grounds. Jason will soon seek out the baby as his best hope for returning to a world full of animated, featherless bipeds that squish when you whack them with a sharp object. Not content with trying to pass off this laughable, convoluted plot on an increasingly enraged audience, director Adam Marcus and his fellow travelers introduce a few other dumb characters. There's a slimy reporter attempting to ingratiate himself into the lives of Jason's descendants in order to get a scoop, some loudmouth, ultra stupid white trash characters running a diner near Crystal Lake, some cops, and a bounty hunter by the name of Creighton Duke gunning for the money placed on Voorhees's head. A lot of people die violently at the hands of whomever Jason possesses at the moment, but it's all done in a rather unoriginal way. The conclusion of the film, with the inevitable showdown between Voorhees and the good guys, simply reeks. By the time the credits mercifully rolled, I knew I had seen one of the worst films in the history of American cinema. That ""The Final Friday"" ever received a theatrical release is a crime against humanity.
The only positive in this film is seeing Erin Gray again, still looking great in her fifties. Millions of men my age have rather vivid memories of this actress from her tenure on the television show ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,"" where Gray usually appeared in a skintight spandex outfit with a plunging neckline. In fact, I credit Gray with helping me ford that difficult gulf lying between childhood and early adolescence. I wept tears of shame when I saw her appear in this pap. Fortunately, she saves herself from complete ignominy by dying early on. Gray helps the film, but not nearly enough. Everyone else is awful, especially Duke Creighton (Steven Williams), a character so loaded up with ersatz machismo that he comes off looking like a fool. What's with Duke's confrontation with Diana in the diner? Or the incredibly stupid scene in the jail cell where Duke will only provide information about Voorhees to one of the heroes of the film if he allows the bounty hunter to break his fingers? Creighton Duke isn't a tough as nails hero; he's a sadist. And we're supposed to admire this guy?
The DVD version of the film does offer plenty of extras (unlike Paramount's releases of the eight preceding installments), including deleted scenes, trailers, a commentary, a widescreen picture transfer, and some other junk. There's even an option to watch an unrated version of the film, a version promising more gore than the theatrical cut. Is it gorier than the 'R' rated cut? Probably, but not as gory as many other extreme horror films easily available on DVD. In any case, the rest of the film is so bad that the bloodshed does nothing to save it. Give ""The Final Friday"" a pass. Believe me, you aren't missing much.",1078876800,5,5542,4.755970924195223
686157,1,6303579396,"After the abortion that is called ""Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"", ""Paramount Pictures"" finally got the hint and stopped producing the ""Friday"" films. But, instead of letting the films drift in limbo & collect dust on video store shelves, the studio made a very stupid, yet profitable (of course), move by selling the future rights to produce movies in the series to ""New Line Cinema"" - home to Freddy Krueger. This is the major reason why this film and the other two installments don't have the title or subtitle ""Friday the 13th"" in them. Its also the reason why fans won't see flashbacks from earlier ""Friday"" films in future movies (""Paramount"" still owns the rights to those earlier ""gems"". The greedy bastards.). With all of this said, this still doesn't save ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"".
Trying to take the series in a new direction ""Jason Goes To Hell"" does just that. Its an empty handed affair with no scares, or frights of any kind. Jason has returned to Crystal Lake & starts to prey on a young hottie (how in hell he got here is anyone's guess. Everyone who sat thru ""Friday VIII"" watched the poor bastard melt in a sunami full of toxic waste while crying for his mommie!). The whole ordeal is a trap set up by the FBI to take and destroy Jason. After Jason is blown up, his remains are taken to the morgue where the coroner is somehow possessed into eating Jason's black, beating heart (stop laughing). Now with Jason taking over the coroner's body he resorts to what he does best....needlepoint, learning the finer points of being a metrosexual, uh,wait a sec that's ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"". Jason resorts to what he - I think you get the drift. Its up to a magic dagger and Jason's family tree to send Jason to hell (no, really. That's the plot.) Basically, the whole film is one trailer for ""Freddy vs. Jason"". Avoid this film like a bad case of monkeypox.",1078358400,3,1912,4.577259475218659
686158,3,6303579396,"Originally dubbed ""The Final Friday"", this ninth entry into the ""Friday the 13th"" series, the first for New Line, was anything but final for the series that grossed (and grossed out) millions. It pales as an entry in the long running series, but it stands as a decent and very campy horror romp that horror fans, and gore hounds, will want to revisit on occasion.
Kane Hodder dons the hockey mask for the third time as the unstoppable Jason Voorhees, this time blown to bits in the first 5 minutes of the movie by an FBI ambush. As one might guess, this doesn't stop him. It is revealed that Jason is a demon, one that can inhabit other bodies, though can only live through another link in the Voorhees bloodline. His bloodline (inexplicably, he has family members) catch wind of this and set out to stop him. He is chased by a bounty hunter, the typical movie type that warns everybody but few listen. Most people think that Jason is dead (and celebrate this fact), but since the murders continue, a select few delve into the mythology and look for ways to banish him to hell once and for all. Jason himself, in his true form, is only in the movie for about 15 minutes. The rest of the time is spent with his ""demon"" (a large parasite-like worm) taking over other bodies. This being the case, it feels very detached from the rest of the series, and many true fans might be turned off by the change of venue, like many were with ""Jason Takes Manhattan"". The acting is actually decent for the most part, and the direction of Adam Marcus attempts to breath new life into a series that had run out of steam.
The main problem, however, is the ambitious nature of the movie. Like the latter ""Halloween"" sequels, too much effort is spent trying to add an elaborate back story and the mythology is changed to suit this. Ultimately, when the formula of the series is strayed too far from, the movies invariably suffer. ""Jason Goes To Hell"" is no exception. While the kudos goes to the filmmakers for trying to cap off the series in style, it falls flat in it's attempt to explain a simple plot with overly elaborate subtext. Having said that, the shining moments are plentiful. The gore in this entry obviously benefited from the bigger budget, with easily some of the most gruesome murders in the series. The sexuality and nudity are also kicked up, keeping continuity with the rest of the series. While I found the story to be a bit of a letdown, the overall movie is entertaining, even if it doesn't fit with the other movies in the series.
The New Live DVD is the polar opposite of the bare-bones Paramount DVDs, with some nice supplements. Similar to the latter issues of ""Jason X"" and ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", this DVD has some nice extras to reward the fans. The most notable of which is the commentary with Director Adam Marcus and the screenwriter, Dean Lorey, and they handle it with plenty of self-deprecating humor. But it is not a novelty commentary, since they are serious about the movie and their love for it. The topics discussed range from the technical details to the fun trivia facts that fans of the series (like myself) gobble up. The disk also includes both the R-Rates and Unrated version. Though the time difference between the two is a little over 3 minutes, they feel very different. The Unrated version is obviously the one to go for.
""Jason Goes To Hell"" is a fun horror movie, despite the faults in it's attempt to change the Jason mythology. I liked it better when he was that evil boy who punished naught teenagers, and it's a bit hard to accept him being a demon. But with it's gore and excessive campiness, it still holds true to many of the conventions of the series.",1077148800,,3689,4.523952095808383
686159,5,6303579396,"Jason Goes To Hell is one of the best additions to the series.  Now everyone says he isn't in this one either, but he is, in spirit.  He does everything that Jason would do but in a different body.  People are fickel, 'cuz they wanna see a guy in a hockey mask, turn on ESPN.  Jason still killed the victims, but there's no getting that across to most people.  They needed a way to end the series and set up Freddy Vs. Jason, I'd love to read a script from ya'll that's better.",1077148800,,477,4.086021505376344
686160,4,6303579396,"Like it's been said a hundred times before, Jason is in this movie for a very short amount of time, kind of like Boba Fett in the original Star Wars trilogy. So of course to hard core Jason fans such as myself, this is a letdown, however, this film does belong in the series and has some positive points.
The red-headed agent who lures Jason into the kill zone in opening sequence is HOT! Great nude scene as she's stripping for the shower. When Jason blows up it is a spectacle indeed. The poor guy doesn't know what hit him.
Kane returns as Jason, but he also plays a security guard at the hospital. He gets killed by Jason's spirit as he possesses a doctor. Speaking of the doctor, the heart eating scene deserved an Academy Award. Another great kill was when he impaled his fellow doctor.
So anyway Jason jumps from body to body as a slimy snake. Sure it's a little kooky, but then again we're talking about a boy who drowned as a young boy and is now an unstoppable killer. You can't look into this too much, if you want reality, slasher movies is not the place to find it.
The restaurant slaughter was the highlight.
Another cool concept was Jason's rebirth. His ""snake"" crawls between the legs of his dead sister.
The bounty hunter was a ham from the get go and the hero was a nerd. Those are the low points. Any fool who will offer his fingers to a maniac in the next jail cell has got to be stupid to begin with.
The final scene where Jason fights the hero was a bit labored. I mean Jason usually kills someone in less than a second, but he wrestles around with this guy inthe yard. We can only assume he's a little disorientated what with his new body and all. Do not ask me how he's born with his mask on though.
The final scene with Freddy's glove was kind of cool. I know it raised a lot of questions, but it sure got everybody at Fangora talking. It's my least favorite of the series, but I can't slam a Jason film, he still rules.",1077062400,,1945,4.231182795698925

From Friday the 13th part 1 to Jason goes to Hell, there was a lot of originality from the series lost in that short time span!",1075593600,,359,4.1
686162,3,6303579396,"'Jason Goes To Hell,' the ninth installment in the everlasting 'Friday the 13th' series, was the first Jason flick under the wing of New Line Cinema, so it would stand to reason that this one is a little different than those that came before. Within the first ten minutes, Jason is blown to bits. A S.W.A.T. team drops bombs on Jason at his home in Camp Crystal Lake during an ambush that seems like a routine for Jason. To the citizens of Crystal Lake, the nightmare is over. But nothing could be farther from the truth. As a character who finally hitched a ride in on the Jason mythology on the ninth installment, Creighton Duke, tells us, Jason is now body-hopping. His spirit is using up bodies so that he can temporarily survive in order to be resurrected through a Vorhees woman. Apparently Mrs. Vorhees was lying or just plain crazy when she referred to Jason as her only child in the first film, because it turns out Jason has a sister! Not only that, but a niece and a brand new baby grand-niece. So Jason spends the 90 minutes making his way to any of these potential hosts so that he can be resurrected once again and continue his legacy of carnage. The movie itself is pretty cheesy, whether it's intentional or not, it adds to the entertainment value. The actors are all awful, without any range (staying true to 'Friday the 13th' tradition) and they take a back-seat to over-the-top gore. With an unrated cut on this disc, this is the bloodiest 'Friday' flick to date. We get to see a man rapidly decompose, another man eating Jason's heart and plenty of other little disgusting desserts. Also, what Jason movie would be complete without a little T&A? Well, this movie's got that too! Overall, it's a fair viewing, worth seeing if only for the legendary ending, but overall, an odd and uneven installment in the 'Friday' series. If you ask me, 'Jason X' gets more points in the entertainment and originality department. The DVD is pretty decent (considering the movie). We get both the rated & unrated cuts of the movie, deleted/alternate scenes (most of them from the TV version), filmmaker commentary (worth buying the DVD to be entertained by these guys) and the infamous 'Jump To A Death' feature for all of the impatient gore-hounds.",1075161600,2,2252,4.660804020100502

686237,1,6303579396,"Oh boy.  I have no idea what the makers of this Jason flick were thinking when they wrote this stinker.  You know, there are certain things you have to put aside when you view a Jason movie.  I know this, and most of all, the fans know this.  You have to forget about great acting, the brilliant storyline and so on.  That's all fine with me.  When I see a Jason flick, I only want to be entertained.  I want to see Jason keeping the body-count rising and rising.
But ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is a complete embarrassment.  It is almost impossible to watch.  Is it because of the gore?  Well, there's a lot of it, but no.  Gore is what I expect.  Is it because it's scary?  Most certainly not.  Nothing very scary about this movie.  So why is it almost impossible to watch?
It was terribly written.  That's right.  Of course I'm not expecting Arthur Miller when I watch a ""Friday the 13th"" movie, but I expect the story to be somewhat bearable.  Supposedly Jason has the ability to transport from different bodies.  Once he's done with one, his spirit invades another.  He must do this until he can find a blood-relative of some sort to be ""re-born.""  What does this mean?  Means that you hardly see the hockey-masked killer until the last half of the movie.  And even then it's not that great.  While there's some cool death scenes and extremely gory scenes, this movie ends up being a dud.  Actually, calling it a ""dud"" is being too polite.
It's simple.  All they needed to do was have some kind of minor story going on that would lead to Jason coming back from the grave and unleashing his bloody revenge upon carefree teens who think Crystal Lake is a safe place to venture.  See, very simple.  But no, they had to create an outrageous story that really kind of takes the focus away from Jason himself.  The movie doesn't even pick up where the last one ended.  That already was a clue that the writers had no idea what to do with the movie.
The DVD is very cool... too bad the movie isn't.  You can watch the Rated-R version or the unrated one.  There's commentary, ""Jump to a Death"" feature, alternate scenes and more.  I didn't really pay too much attention to the extras, being that I didn't like the movie.
""Jason Goes to Hell"" is a sorry excuse for a Jason movie.  My advice is to skip it, but if you've seen the rest then you might as well see it so you can say that you have indeed viewed it.  Lame story, bad plot, terrible premise, these are only a few of the things that make this movie a stinker.  Could've been so much more, I'm sorry to say.  The previous Jason flicks are MUCH better than this.  Watch at your own risk...",1061596800,5,2635,4.3128834355828225

Again, as I said in my review of Part 5; Even though Jason was practically not in this movie that isn't the reason I'm trashing it. The plot itself was ridiculous and it took eight sequels to decide that only a relative of Jason can kill him by stabbing a ""selected"" knife through Jason's heart. Come on, even I could have come up with something better than that. Like Part 5 & 7, this is a real stinker. Fortunately, this movie did not end the series.",1059782400,2,621,4.226890756302521

While this movie is full of gore and has some entertaining moments, this script would have worked better as its own film rather than just taking a dump on a popular horror franchise.

686287,4,6303579396,"After the events of ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" as he wasn't really reborn a child at the end of that movie because it was a hallucination, Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) has survived that toxic waste spill he suffered at the end of that movie and heads back to Crystal Lake for more killing. After chasing a young woman (Julie Michaels) in the cabins near the lake, he chases after her as it becomes a setup for the mad undead goalie as he is shot by a SWAT Team then blow up to smithereens leaving only his heart with pieces of his body remain which means the end of Jason Voorhees for good. A coroner doctor (Richard Gant) does an exam on the body as the heart is still beating yet it has a power to hypnotise as he eats it then gets possessed by the spirit of Jason as his power is inside of a Eel-like demon that has been living inside Jason all the time has the power to jump through body to body until he can find a member of his family to be reborn again. A bounty hunter named Duke (Steven Williams) believes he's not dead and knows everything about Jason as that creature's mission is to find Jessica Kimble (Kari Keegan) and her baby who are relatives to Jason. A legend tells that only through the body of a Voorhees can Jason be reborn and only by a Voorhees can he be defeated for all time, Jessica's boyfriend Steve (John D. LaMay of the Friday The 13th TV Series fame) must try to protect her and the child from harm including letting her know that she is the only one to send Jason to hell for eternity.

A quite unusual but different entry of the popular slasher saga of Friday The 13th from director Adam Marcus and producer Sean S. Cunningham. Paramount Pictures gave up on Friday The 13th after Jason Takes Manhattan was a low box-office grosser then gave the rights to Jason to the creator Sean Cunningham then in 1992 after New Line Cinema successfully killed off Freddy Krueger in 1991's Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare, it seems that Krueger's company New Line Cinema bought the rights to the Friday The 13th franchise to become Jason's new home. Co-starring Billy Green Bush with Steven Culp, this is a new take on Jason Voorhees and gives us the reason why he keeps coming back including his origins on why he keeps being resurrected. This movie does offer some graphic kills like a pole straight through a woman's body then slashed in half and a arm being ripped with the bone showing out, the acting is still not that great and neither is the storyline. This movie is notable for the famous ending featuring a certain clawed villain that sets up for 2003's ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", all i gotta say that i got to give kudos for New Line doing something different to the series.

This DVD contains both the unrated cut with scenes of gore not shown to avoid NC-17 Rating and theatrical R rated cut with audio commentary, TV Version alternate scenes, jump to a death and Trailer.",1049500800,,2896,4.431519699812383
686288,1,6303579396,"Jason 9 doesnt really pick up on where ""Jason takes Manhattan"" leaves off. When Jason had a pile of toxic waste dumped on him in the previous film and he turned back into a little boy I just thought, ""that was a wierd ending, but how the hell can jason come back after that??!"" Well, he did. How? Who knows? They never explain how, he's just there.
Anyways, in the beginning we see Jason fall into a trap set up by some swat team and get blown to bits (a pretty cool scene) and then he gets sent to a lab to be examined. Why? why not just throw the body out or something? Anyway, ( and let me not try to laugh while I type this) his inner soul flies out of his body  in little orange glowy circles and goes into one of the lab doctors (chuckle, chuckle) and from there the lab doctor is now Jason. Well, he's still played by the same lab doctor it's just that Jason's soul is inside him. So basically we see Jason for about 10 minutes in the beginning of the film and only about 20 at the end of the film. The rest is spent by these loser nobodies who have been taken over by Jason's spirit running around killing random people. I was very dissappointed Jason didn't play a bigger role in this. Although there was 1 interesting twist, Jason now could only be killed by the hands of a member of his family, which was played by some girl (a distant relative)
It ends with well, you guessed it, Jason going to hell. There is one cool scene at the very end of the film where, well I don't want to ruin it, but a horror character from another horror series makes a very brief cameo. It's a cool way to end it and will have people talking.
Besides these little good things I've listed, it doesnt help this from being one laughably bad horror movie. It's not scary, it's not dark, instead it's comedic and silly. I heard Jason X was just as bad but I'll still  have to check that one out.

It takes place from Jason being blown to smitherines, despite his brain living. a paramedic is forced by jasons soul to eat the brain, which is just the begginging of the terror. It is a curse which can be passed on to anyone. leaving the question, where is jason now? he could be anywhere. he shows up at the end, for a final battle of his life. (or so i wished, with the acception of jason x.) despite the fact it SHOULD have been the final movie of the series, the reason they made Jason x, is probably because they wanted to remind people there was still a hockey masked sedistic psycho killer who can do none other than kill, and simply whisper chh chh chh haa haa haa. chh chh chh haa haa haa. chh chh chh haa haa haa.",1044489600,2,989,4.129533678756476

The film starts off with a great surprise by seeing our favorite masked killer get blown to bits, followed by a slithering, slimy creature which is really Jason that is jumping from body to body.  It sounds like a nice idea, but it isn't pulled off well at all, and Jason Goes to Hell is just one big bore.  However, there are some good points.  It is very nice to see an older film in the Friday series on DVD with some actual extras on it (thanks to New Line/Warner, who now own the Jason property, while the other older films were distributed by Paramount) including a commentary by the director and screen writer, and it also includes the extremely violent unrated version that is by far the absolute goriest film in this long running series.

Who is this bounty hunter that is searching for Jason and where was he when Jason was cutting up teenagers at Camp Crystal? Why does the parasite turn into Jason when it enters the body of a dead Vorehes? Why doesn't Jason kill the boyfriend instead of fighting him?

686315,5,6303579396,"The murderous, diabolical, indestructable, psycho-fiend, Jason Voorhees, is back in his ninth film, and this time, he's not who he used to be! For all you Friday the 13th fans out there who have been wanting a different type of Jason movie, this is the break you've been waiting for.
Right at the beginning, we all see an event that sets the mood of the story. Late at night at Camp Crystal Lake, a sexy girl camper, the perfect kind of prey for the homicidal Jason Voorhees, gets ready to turn in for the night after showering. The lights go out and she is confronted by Jason (who else?). But little does Jason know that this camper is really an FBI agent. The under-cover agent lures Jason into the woods where teams of agents armed with lethal firearms lie in wait. As Jason raises his blood-stained machete and goes in for the kill, lights turn on and the squad starts filling him full of holes before Jason is blown apart in a grenade explosion. But as we watch Jason's body get blown to kingdom come, we see the serial killer bounty hunter, Creighton Duke, watching the scene from behind a tree. ""I don't think so,"" he says. It's obvious that Jason is not actually dead. Each time Jason is believed to be finally gone, he arises with more rage and power than ever. Now he has the ability to jump between bodies. From the mourge where his remains are examined, Jason's dead, yet still beating, heart comes alive and takes over the body of the corenor after trancing him into eating it! And as the now-possesed man walks out of the room after murdering a fellow worker Jason-style, we catch a glimpse of his reflection on a steel door. Only it's not HIS reflection. We see Jason, in all his glory, instead. The essence of Jason, in the form of a snakelike monster, leaps from person to person through some bloody transfers of spirit so that Jason can pose as anyone. As it turns out, it's the ultimate identity crisis. Jason may not look the same, but he still has all the blood-frenzied rage and psycho killer instincts that make him the total mockery of humanity that he is (he doesn't wear that hockey mask for nothing either!).
Jason is out for more than just continuing his murders as he heads back to Crystal lake posing as someone else. And what is he after? Well, watch the movie and see for yourself! And remember, if you see the word ""final"" in the title of a Friday the 13th moive, you can assume that it really isn't final. If you puke easily, this movie isn't for you, especially the autopsy scene, that one will nuasiate even the most tolerant of watchers. Here's some last words to all of you out there who are trying to kill Jason: ""You can shoot Jason down and blow him away. BUT HE'LL RISE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY!!!""",1039564800,2,2737,4.4541832669322705
686316,3,6303579396,"The plot to this movie is just ridiculous. What were they thinking? Any TRUE Friday the 13th fan (myself included) knows that the series officially ended with Jason Takes Manhattan. And this movie here is not a Friday the 13th film. It's a JASON movie. And not a terribly good one either.

First off, the make-up for old Jay isn't so cool. It looks fake. The hockey mask is too small and seems to have been melted onto his face. Plus he doesn't have much screen time (always a mistake in JASON movie). The dialogue and acting (some cast members are competent enough I should stress) is unbelievable. It's so basic!

And this JASON movie seems to rip-off plot elements from Evil Dead (the presence of the Necronomicon and the Dagger) and The Hidden. Did Pamela Voorhees use the Necronomicon to bring back old Jay? Does this explain the whole 'Hell Baby' thing going on? It might, but it' never really made clear to us.

The showdown at the end is a bit of an anti-climax. There's no real energy or excitement to it. And Jason's decent into hell is just big non-event. A couple of oversized Cookie Monster hands come up from the ground and drag him thru the suspiciously loose gravel. Zuh?

But New Line makes up for this by providing us with an unrated DVD that restores the gore. This is something Paramount never did. Now the movie seems very over-the-top and some of it is really gross. This was the whole idea for parts 1-8. People cringe and freak at the blood and guts. When you cut them out you castrate the movie and it becomes exceedingly dull. So far this DVD is the only glimpse of what the first 8 could have been like.

Plus the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is looking fine. And the DTS 5.1 soundtrack is loud, loud, loud. This is very good when considering the ambient effects and constant surround use. But Harry Manfredini's score is not...good. His music in Friday the 13th Part 1-7 (Fred Mollin for part 8) was dead cool and used screeching strings and orchestra. Now if JGTH he uses a badly out of tune synthesizer. And it's simply awful.

Buy this DVD. It makes for a great double-bill with Jason X. And New Line's quality and commitment to making it the best possible DVD presentation is something Paramount would never do.",1038096000,5,2240,4.532178217821782

To some weird extent in this one his heart is a parasite that can jump from body to body when the origional carcass is destroyed (in this case blown to hell).  He then continues to kill but in variose bodies.  It is up to his neice to slay him (because his sister dies) but with the problem that if Jason goes inside her aka through the vagina, he will be reborn and continue to kill.  Actually one way or another he would kill but it would not require him to leap from corpse to corpse.  There is a bounty hunter after him as well and in the end he is defeated in a special effects style kill (a bunch of hands from the earth grab him and drag him down) and it sets up for Freddy vs Jason set to be released sometime in 2003/2004 time range.

  This film was made in 1992 and released to the general public on Friday, August 13, 1993.  This film was not well advertised at all.  I only saw one big poster at a bus shelter and that was it.
  I go to see JASON GOES TO HELL and I hated the film at first and made very much fun of it.  With JASON X having ""Alien Resurrection"" written all over it, JASON GOES TO HELL has ""The Hidden"" written all over it, another film by New Line Cinema.  When it comes to a Friday the 13th film, logic just goes out the door.  A great thing about this film is that it totally disregards the embarrassing Jason Takes Manhattan (Part 8).
 I started to like the film after not seeing it for months, when released as a ""Original Directors' Uncut Edition"" in 1994 on VHS.  With the help of a friend, I am the proud owner of JASON GOES TO HELL on DVD.
 Many people were complaining about the film being too dark in the DVD transfer. I saw the film on DVD and some scenes were dark but in my opinion, it didn't detract from watching the film, I thought it added to it in the sense that I was expecting to see dark scenes in the film...The sound was perfect. Watching the film on Widescreen was great as well, for the first time in standard widescreen (1.85:1) format.
 Also, the DVD cover is great, the Animated Menu Board was great and better than JASON X and better than the Paramount DVD's. ALso, there is the Theatre Trailer, a Jump to a Death Sequence(s), Deleted Footage from the TV version and Commentary by the writer and director of the film.  I listened to the commentary by Dean Lorey (writer) and Adam Marcus (director) and these guys are nuts - but too hilarious.  This commentary is one of the better ones I have ever heard on film.  Certainly beats the commentary on JASON X, which is way too boring.
 JASON GOES TO HELL is in my opinion, the goriest film in the film series. There are Unrated and R-Rated Versions available on the DVD and I wonder which version people will watch ?? There is still missing footage of David's death in Vicky's house as his skull was crushed with teeth knocked out in the bathroom sink - I wonder if New LIne still has that footage in their vaults ??
 In closing, JASON GOES TO HELL despite its little detractions in story is one of the better film in the series and this DVD was well worth the wait. A must have for fans of the series.

Ee then goes out trying to find blood realitives who we never knew existed in order for him to be reborn. this was a great movie and I plan to get it on DVD and my favorite part is at the end there you see Jason's Hockey mask on the ground and were thinking its finally over WHEN FREDDY KRUGGER'S KNIFE GLOVED HAND POPS OUT OF THE GROUND AND PULLS IT DOWN INTO HELL which tells me that theres going to be Freddy Vs.

This movie proves that the films should stick with the simple, cheesy, juvenile formula it's always had. They were very fun that way. The viewer is expected to swallow alot of [garbage]here. First off, that the whole time, Jason was really-down deep-some grotesque Lovecraftian spermy creature. Give me a break. When a horror series goes on for some time, they always try to throw some new ""twist"" into the story and it always ends up being terrible. Like the little evil floating teardrop shaped spirits in ""Freddy's Dead"" that possess him. Or the bogus theory in Halloween 6 that Michael is part of some druid cult that murders family when the stars are in line.  The whole ""body jumping"" thing doesn't fit this film.  It's been done before and kinda takes the Jason presence out of the movie. What else? Oh, Jason has a long lost sister! You gotta be kidding! Didn't Jason's mother in the first FT13 say that Jason was her only child?? And the only way to kill Jason now is to stab him with some magical dagger(?) the black dude from 21 Jump Street happens to have hanging around.  Let me say that again: Jason must be stabbed with a magical dagger in order to kill him once and for all.  I think that pretty much sums up the rotten direction this franchise was taken in.

As far as the DVD goes, it could be a lot better. The rated and unrated versions are nice, as is the theatrical trailer (Personally I thought the trailer was done extremely well, short, quick, and some awesome music), the problem is with the deleted scenes. If you watch the trailer you see an image of a large creature snarling, this the scene where the creature version of Jason grows to a considerable size and attacks the main characters. Though it was cut from the movie. As were the original monsters that bring Jason to hell. They looked like demons made of roots - as opposed to the large floppy hands we see in the movie - they looked really sweet, but I guess the director just didn't like them. And a particularly gruesome death scene (a faucet is involved...don't ask) was removed as well. I was really hoping to see these scenes in the DVD, but I guess we never will.

You only get to see Jason twice in the movie(which disgruntled alot of fans). Yet, somehow, that idea worked and it actually was an awesome movie. I have to admire the people who made this film, they had the big kahunas to try something new. I wish more directors of these horror icons could do that. Giving a new take on them would be cool.

The Hidden - they use elements from ""The Hidden"" to show how Jason jumps from body to body.
Halloween - they steal Myers origin and apply it to Jason (so to speak). Also, in one scene, the lead actress tells one of the inempt cops that she left her ex for dead, ""just off the Myers house"".
Tales From the Crypt - The box that held the Tazmanian devil is right there in the Vorhee's basement.
Evil Dead - The Book of the Dead is also an artifact to be found in the Vorhee's house.
Nightmare on Elm Street - Freddy's here - just wait and see.

686376,4,6303579396,"....Well not totally the end(Jason X)But Jason goes to hell if you can get past some of the holes in the story line, and hokeyness of it all, this my friends is a great horror film, its got the campy feel to it, the gore is there; especially if you watch the unrated version. There is an element of drama in this too.  So basically here its is:  Jason is back but the thing of it is that its the evil essense of jason going from one body to the next making his way back to Crystal Lake(..yes everything is explained in the beginning as to why this is.) There is a good subplot to this involving Jasons' sister (played by Erin Gray...remember her as Wilma from the Buck Rogers TV show?) and her daughter, who also has an infant daughter. (thats also one of the holes in the story line---Jason doesn't have a sister, Mom said so in the first Friday the 13th film) At any rate, there is also Bounty hunter Creighton Duke hunting down Jason for reward cash, who also seems to know all about moving from body to body, and how to eventually kill him.
For die hard fans of Jason himself, you only get to see the hockey mask wearing slasher twice in the movie. But the film itself is excellent good gore, and in my opinion good camera shots, cinematography and lighting.  If you've seen all the other jason films up to this one, you already know enough about jason, what makes this movie fresh is the cast around the killer and what they do and the sacrifices they make by the end of the film.  If you get this film....things to watch for  the diner scene when the lights go out....any scene with Creighton duke in it is cool to watch, and of course the opening scene up to when the films starting credits begin....far out..I'd like to tell you how it ends but You need to see it for yourself.",1033516800,4,1785,4.269230769230769

There are people who say that this movie ignores the previous sequel, ""Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"", but it really doesn't. I think Jason's ""melted"" appearance and torn-up outfit in this movie was the result of what happened at the conclusion of that previous installment. The make-up on Kane Hodder, the person who plays Jason, is truly excellent.
Besides the make-up, other excellent elements in the movie are the gore effects, and the lighting in the diner scene.

The other new realization is that Jason's demonic spirit can only be sent to Hell by someone within his bloodline. You will have to see for yourself how it all turns out. Gore hounds should love this flick as there is lots of bloody mayhem including one of the sickest most graphic autopsy scenes ever, people get mutilated, run over, shot to pieces, stabbed, impaled, smashed in the face and  submerged in hot grease- one guy is shot in the head and his brain is splattered all over the wall, a head is crushed and blood/brains squirt out the top of their skull like a geyser, a girl gets ripped in half with a metal stake in graphic blood spraying detail, a body explodes and it's pieces rain from the sky, a police officer melts and turns into a rotten pile of pus, goo, and slime plus TONS of other gore and sickness.

Jason Goes To Hell takes a different turn for the Friday series but spicing it up with supernatural sub-plots and things of the sort.  It also is pretty much unedited in terms of the gore.  If you're watching the Unrated Director's Original Cut, feel safe you're seeing the make-up mans vision uncut!  This entry loads up on trucks full of blood and buckets of guts, not to mention one of the most extremely graphic sex scenes ever put on screen.  And with all this, its succeeds admirably at being a non-stop roller coaster ride!
(...) By Part VII, the typical ""Jason stalks teens a Crystal Lake and slaughters them"" plot got very dull, and sending Jason to the big apple in Part VIII didn't help much either, but this was a breath of fresh air.  And, for once, the acting is good!  John D. LeMay tackles the nerdy hero role quite well, and you find yourself rooting for him quite often (he also has the pleasure of saving the day about 10,000 times), and Kari Keegan was great as Jessica.  Again, Kane Hodder brings some strange sort of a dimension to Jason, even if his screen time is limited.  He also plays the security guard with the beard at the mourge.  Man, has he got muscles!  Also, Erin Gray was just terrific as Diana.  Yes, she does seem to be taking her role way to seriously, but she's playing an important part, and she plays it quite well.  And who could forget Rusty Schwimmmer as Joey B.? She's downright hilarious!  And Billy Green Bush has a small appearance, as well.  Wait!  I almost forgot to mention Steven Williams awesome portrayol of Duke!  Man, this guy's great!  He's my favorite character of the whole series.
Anyway, for those of you who don't plan to watch this film because there's no teens or sex, never fear!  There's both!  (...)
Anyway, Jason Goes To Hell is a great film, and if you know you're not getting your typical Friday film, you'll love it!

686443,4,6303579396,"*Review edited and revised on 08/23/2013

The most divisive of the infamous ""Friday the 13th"" series, ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"" was Jason Vorhees' first (and subsequently, only) venture into the '90s as well as New Line Cinema's first stab at the well-worn franchise. After eight films that more or less played on the same concept -- killer stalks naked teens in woods -- the franchise was in desperate need of fresh blood and fresh ideas.

Enter Adam Marcus, newbie director and buddy of the original film's director's son. Through either luck or some form of nepotism, the young film-maker was handed the reigns to the iconic franchise, whether he was ready or not. With screenwriter and friend Dean Lorey in tow, the supposed final entry in the franchise finds everybody's favorite unhappy camper being blown to bits in the first ten minutes. Is Jason finally dead? Not quite. Now he's taken to hopping bodies and faster than you can say ""Was that the boogeyman?"" he's hunting down the offspring of his sister in an effort to ensure his bloodline lives on, ala ""Halloween II"" (and just about every other ""Halloween"" sequel thereafter).

""Jason Goes To Hell"" is without question the most ambitious of the ""Friday"" flicks that precede it, and for that it deserves kudos. Marcus and Lorey may have been well over their heads in tackling such a massive franchise, but their zeal and love of the genre bleeds through in just about every scene. Sadly, the concepts they introduce to the franchise are rather heavy-handed and contrived. Borrowing elements from the aforementioned ""Halloween"" series and ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" -- among others -- this sequel can't help but get bogged down with an abundance of recycled dead-end ideas that are coming completely out of left-field when you consider that this is the ninth entry in the series and we're only just now learning that Jason has a sister and that there is a magic dagger that can kill him and yes, there's a bounty hunter on his tail.

Speaking of bounty hunter, Steven Williams plays the role of Creighton Duke with such enthusiasm that he single-handedly lifts the film out of mediocrity. This character alone makes the film worth watching and serves as the best adversary Jason has met since the days of Tommy Jarvis. Shame that the rest of the cast isn't quite up to task. John D. Lemay is decent as the nerdy ex-brother-in-law to Jason, but the rest of the cast is either given nothing to do or simply exist only to give the filmmakers' buddies something to do. This is, of course, mentioning nothing of the plot which gets the more ridiculous the longer it goes on.

Granted, ""Jason Goes To Hell"" isn't quite as bad as its reputation. If nothing else, it's an entertaining and surprisingly fresh detour in a franchise that was admittedly getting stale by the time ""Friday The 13th: Jason Takes Manhattan"" washed ashore. With an abundance of gooey, gory effects (all about the cop melting before your very eyes) and pre-requisite nudity, ""The Final Friday"" pays more than enough fan-service while, at the very least, trying something new. Be sure to stick it through to the ending for a cameo from another well-known '80s slasher villain, giving way to the inevitable ""vs."" movie a decade down the line.

Bottom line: When it comes to the ninth entry in a horror franchise, you could do much worse than ""Jason Goes To Hell.""",1003276800,3,3406,4.803754266211604

Some hardcore fans might not like this film because there is a substantial amount of parts in this movie without Jason. You see very little of him in this one. Another reason they might not like it is because of the whole supernatural aspect of it. Plus, there's no teens. The big reason gorehounds will like this is because the movie is very bloody and violent as hell. It is definitley the bloodiest ""Friday"" of them all. The Filmmakers throw us a curve and have Jason blown up at the beginning of the movie. From there, Jason's spirit jumps from body to body trying to get to his niece's newborn baby to be reborn. OOOOOOkkkkkaaayyy. It's just another rehash of ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"". What's really nice about this movie is the new background we get on Jason's family. We see his house, his sister, and like I just mentioned, his niece. We also get a look at why Jason is who he is and how he survives everything. The end fight between Jason and Steven is great, but it's over too quickly. It needed to be longer to have a more lasting effect. Kane Hodder as Jason is frightening and strong as ever. The rest of the cast, well, they are pretty typical. Jason's new look is nice. The mask has now become more part of his head because he's had it on for so long. The strands of hair he has are reminiscent of Part 2. The end scene... was a nice wink, but not entirely needed. Jason Goes To Hell is a nice new twist to the series and an acceptable end to the Jason saga. But, as we all know now, he's coming back.

686488,3,6303579396,"GOOD- it was a great horror movie. jason gets blown up. some idiot actually eats his heart. after that jason is able to possess that character and he does. its is kinda creepy how jason can be any1 or anywhere and you would never know. the beginning ambush was cool and a nice try might i add. but just not good enough. the story line was a good one and yes more complex then story lines in the 80s friday flicks. the gore and the tent scene was great.
BAD- the heart became an alien like creature. that part was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. jason is not an alien or demon. he is simply a zombie that still has his soul in his decayed body. the little thing,heart-monster, needs to go into a voorhees to be reborn. cool story but corney execution. he comes out with the mask on and everythin. lets not try and make this even remotely realistic now. not that horror movies are really even suposed to be but that was just a little too much.
OVERALL- great story line. pretty cool movie(mostly). but some of the film was just too corney. it is good enough to buy though. so pick it up and YOU be the judge of this 1.",984182400,,1122,4.175115207373272

In fact, it is the best ""Friday the 13th"" sequel. However, this film does have it's flaws. In the very first ""Friday the 13th"", it is made clear that Jason was an only child. But in this film, Jason suddenly has a sister(!).  The film starts with a solid opening sequence, and the ending is even better. A top notch production which was nicely directed by Adam Marcus. This is also the best acted film of the series. Kudos to New Line Cinema (who acquired the rights from Paramount) for taking this series into a - much needed - new direction.

Unfortunately that's the only scene in the whole movie that I did like.  Though I also enjoyed how it made fun of all those tabloid news shows that  take themselves way too seriously.  The rest of the movie I felt was  pointless and so bad I actually laughed through the rest of it.  Are you  sure this is horror?  It felt much more like a gory comedy to me.,963100800,,501,4.311827956989247
686536,3,6303579396,"After the supposedly 'final' Freddy film, the Friday the 13th series jumped on the bandwagon with this, the supposedly 'final' Jason film.  I seem to remember a film called 'Friday the 13th:The Final Chapter' as well.  Strange.
Everything about this film is contrived and unlikely.  It turns  out that Jason has a sister (despite the fact that it was stated quite  clearly in Part 1 that had was an only child), and Jason, it would appear,  is in fact a worm-like creature which can jump from body to body.  If  that's true then why did it stay in the decomposing body it was in for so  long?  There is no real explanation as to what is going on, the whole thing  is unnecessarily mean-spirited and gratuitous, and somebody obviously  thought that throwing in cameos of various items from other horror films  would somehow make up for the fact that the ice-hockey-masked maniac is  nowhere to be seen for most of the film.  And do doctors really make a  habit out of biting the hearts of corpses?
This film gains stars for at  least trying to be original, and is quite entertaining and amusing, but how  many more 'final' Friday the 13th films are there going to be?",962150400,,1166,4.550724637681159
686537,1,6303579396,"Spoilers ahead,but don't worry. The movie's already a rotten ba-da-bing!
I'm a huge Friday fan. When I saw the poster and theatrical trailer,it looked like the perfect F13th movie. I was one of the very first  people who in the theaters to see it (better yet it was the ultra-violent  unrated version). Now I feel sick to my stomach for what the film makers  have done to the series. I absolutely hated the way they butchered the  series. Here are the flaws galore of the movie-
1. Jason's screen time was  practically useless. I know he wasn't in Parts 1 and 5,but those had  redeeming qualities. This has virtually none. Jason is only in this for like  10 minutes. This was probably the biggest reason why I didn't enjoy the  movie.
2. The storyline is extremely confusing and is right up there with  Phantasm 4 in that it has a confusing story. The idea of Jason having a  sister was very lame and him possessing people was just plain dumb. He  should be slicing and dicing teens with everything from  machetes,axes,spearguns and more,but he shouldn't be invading people's  bodies.
3. Jason's new look is VERY lame. He looks like a loser with skin  bubbling over his mask and hair sticking out the back. He screams like a  girl here too. He was really mean in the first eight,but he's a total wimp  here. I hate the way he was changed.
4. I was quite bothered with the fact  that so many ideas from other movies were stolen. Jason being  able to  possess people is right from The Hidden and him having a sister is straight  outta Halloween.
The only things I liked were the insane gore,neat  special F/X and the incredibly awesome ending,but everything else I  absolutely hated. Everyone involved with this should be ashamed. I hope Jason  X has nothing to do with this and I certainly hope that Freddy vs. Jason  doesn't involve this piece of trash. Pick up Parts 4 and 6 for maximum  satisfaction but avoid this like you would Jason himself. Unrated,but  contains explicit slasher violence,lots of profanity,strong sexuality and  bizarre imagery.",960508800,,2051,4.6722689075630255
686538,4,6303579396,"I thought this movie was pretty good!  It has more of a developing plot than some of the others in the series (such as Jason being ressurected, then killing stupid teens at camp crystal)...well to understand the plot  switches, see the movie.  The violence level is pretty high, so those  horror fans that get squeamish should not apply (if your watching the  un-rated version, but if your seeing the R-rated version, you'll be ok).  I  can't wait for Friday the 13th part 10 (coming soon), and unfortunatly,  Jason VS Freddy has been canceled (seriously, this is not a rumor, it has  been canceled)...I read all about it in a famous UK horror magazine  interview...",956534400,2,666,4.7631578947368425
686539,4,6303579396,"It`s an excellent movie. The sound effect are much better, and so is the filming, but where`s Jason? A Friday 13th movie, starring Jason for 10 minutes. That`s not good enough. Jason died in pt. 8, and my logic tells me  that this isn`t possible. But if you look away from the fact that it`s a  Friday 13th movie, it`s a great movie.

There is some spectacular gore  here!  Enough to please even the most gore houndish of fans. And I'm a  huge-time gore hound. Some fans love it (like me.) And some fans hate it,  for its body-hoping and hell-baby concepts. This film is cheesier than  usual, making it a fun cheesy flick. Particularly as a HEAVILY CHEESY JASON  FLICK.  I hail this film, as a temporare-finale! NOTE : For Evil Dead  viewers, you can catch THE BOOK OF THE DEAD! Also Freddy Krueger shows up  in a cameo, pulling Jason's mask down to hell! Wow!

On the positive side there are a lot of shocking 'jump' scenes, good acting  and the music is composed by Harry Manfredini, the original composer of the  classic, creepy Friday the 13th movie. The situational area is good. Camp  Crystal is revisited, a neglected old wasteground and we also get to see  the Voorhees house. But the plot is still terrible. Jason is finally dead,  blown to pieces at the beginning. We think that's it but Jason's heart is  still alive and soon he starts to possess people. bounty hunter Creighton  Duke knows the secret to Jason's invincibility. Can they stop Jason before  it is too late? This film did make me check the house twice I must admit  but the plot is terrible and so is the film in all fairness so producers,  stop!",947548800,,905,4.463414634146342

7850800,1,6303579396,Terrible movie. But then again I rented it knowing it was going to be awful.,1524960000,,76,4.133333333333334
7850801,2,6303579396,"Okay, so this is easily the worst movie in the franchise. The most entertaining part of the movie is looking for all the Easter Eggs nodding at other classics of the horror genre throughout the movie. See if you can spot them all (they are in virtually every second and third scene). The bad parts... well, I cannot even remember them all, there isn't enough working brain cells willing to endure such torture.

Okay, so what to expect: some cheapened version of the Exorcist with the demonic soul of Jason Voorhees jumping from body to body creating super-zombies by vomiting a hairless cat-like creature into their mouths (supposedly Jason's heart, but it doesn't look like that outside the opening scenes).

What NOT to expect: A 7 foot tall 450lb superhuman deformation in a hockey mask serial killing campers with an array of garden tools and environmental hazards. Pretty much anything you expect from a Jason movie. The hockey mask wearing lunatic only shows for about 15 total minutes of the film at the very beginning and very end (aside from a few glimpses of his ""ghost"" in mirrors).

The reality... To make heads and tails of this you need to know a bit about the comic book ties that bind this movie to the series, otherwise, it makes no sense at all and feels like it's misplaced as a Friday the 13th saga movie. Before ""Jason Takes Manhattan,"" there was a ""Jason Vs. Leatherface,"" comic series (Following the ""Satan's Six"" comic introduction line) where the FBI is investigating the Texas cannibal family and they find out about Jason Voorhees (who somehow ended up in Texas). Meanwhile the ""big corporation"" runs a toxic waste pipeline into Camp Crystal Lake from NYC and Jason returns to find the mess and heads to Manhattan for revenge. This is where Jason gets dipped into toxic waste (Jason Takes Manhattan) and turned into the lumpy mutant misshapen form at the start and finish of ""Jason Goes to Hell."" After Jason Takes Manhattan (but before this film) there was another series of comics that introduce the FBI special ""Anti-Jason"" unit and the bounty hunter Creighton Duke (who seemingly knows how to kill Jason), a tidbit that starts this movie off making no sense at all. Without any nods to these comics in the film, you had to be a bona fide franchise fan and this installment would make SOME better sense, but unfortunately, as a standalone, it feels dry, odd, and unrelated to the series. Nothing explains how Jason can somehow transfer his evil soul into others, unless you count the ""Evil Dead"" nod in the Voorhees House scenes where they have a copy of the original ""Necronomicon Ex Mortis"" on the mantle. If you don't know ""Evil Dead,"" shame on you... but, really, if you don't know the Evil Dead story line, then this also makes no sense, and only somewhat with the inference, but still not really... I mean, how did Jason come up with the Necronomicon, and it was never even hinted at that he could read, since he obviously never went to school... Jason Goes to School, that would be an interesting prequel installment... LOL!  Then the mutating Jason heart into a hairless cat monster (or otter or whatever) and scurrying around makes little sense without the nod to the box in the basement with ""Arctic Expedition, Julia Carpenter,"" painted on the side (J. Carpenter = John Carpenter, Arctic Expedition being a ""The Thing"" reference, creating a mental picture that the evil will do anything to survive, even evolve), and still makes little sense after, as there was no previous abilities inherent to Jason Voorhees, that we were ever made aware of.

This all being the only reason I'll give it 2 stars vs. 1, for creative tie-ins, but to the average viewer, it will be a 0.5...",1524528000,,3715,4.744582043343653
