8492759,5,B0064OOFZM,"Volume 11 of Prisoner: Cell Block H features the last six episodes of the 1982 season and the first 26 from 1983. First shown in the UK from June to August 1989, this boxset sees the conclusion to the major storyline being built up in the previous boxset - Joan vs Bea. Officer Joan 'The Freak' Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick) has been determined to topple top dog Bea Smith (Val Lehman) ever since Joan's arrival. Bea on the other hand is doing all she can to get paroled. Things come to a head when the two ladies are isolated in a cell together during a fire rampaging through Wentworth. What happens next?
Governor Erica Davidson (Patsy King) is forced to handle the evacuation of the surviving women to the nearby Woodridge Prison. there are lots of scenes in Judy's (Betty Bobbitt) Halfway House in this set. Which prisoner's partner does Colleen Powell (Judith McGrath) become romantically involved with? Who's the ex-prisoner who sends a postcard from Sydney to the girls planting aseed in one particular inmate?
New prisoners included in this set include Nola McKenzie (Carole Skinner), Janice Young (Catherine Wilkin),
Valma Pratt appears in one of her many small guest roles in this set and we also see Louise Siversen in a guest role prior to her main role later in the series. Maurie Fields, Babs Wheelton and Kirsty Child also have minor roles in this set.
One question you may wonder is Are there really so few hotel rooms in Melbourne that Lori (Susannah Fowle) seems to be in the same one (eps 343 - 345) vacated by Colleen.
By the end of watching this set you'll be over halfway through the series.
Enjoy the set! It's one of the best!",1340236800,,1651,4.657534246575342
