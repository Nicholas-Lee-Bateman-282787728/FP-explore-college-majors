7329736,5,B01182JIHO,Teepa Snow is awesome!  Her advice is practical and applicable and should be shared not only with professional caregivers but everyone in the service industry.  My mother has dementia - we have encountered many situations where her behavior has been set off or escalated by people who are trying to help but are actually making matters worse.  I highly recommend taking the time to watch several of the Teepa Snow DVDs to gain a better understanding of how to more effectively deal with dementia.  She is not only an expert in her field - she presents in a very engaging manner!,1472256000,2,578,4.693069306930693

7329743,5,B01182JIHO,"I found this info very helpful.  It came at just the right time.  My husband has had dementia for at least 10 years and I have found all the Teepa Snow DVDs to be the most helpful in understanding what is happening to him and how to react to him in the best way.  I want him to be as happy as this disease will let him be, and helping both of us stay calm has been a huge help.  I highly recommend all of Teepa's DVDs.  Also, I very much appreciated the prompt delivery too.",1440460800,2,474,3.8958333333333335

8723773,5,B01182JIHO,"This video is a must have for anyone who cares (professionally, voluntarily or otherwise) for a person living with dementia. With humor, empathy, and just the right amount of detail, Teepa invites her audience into their world; she clearly defines what is happening and offers compassionate insight into how our actions might be contributing to challenging care situations. Her thoughtful advice and practical strategies can be put to use right away and will be helpful at every stage of this difficult journey.",1532304000,,511,5.2439024390243905
8723774,5,B01182JIHO,"A very enlightening DVD.  I think anyone who has a loved one with Dementia should purchase and absorb all the information in it.  Not only does it explain the behavior you are experiencing now, but prepares you for other behaviors yet to come.  Makes you aware of behaviors you never dreamed you would encounter.  Only behavior I would have liked discussed was the dislike of showering.",1531180800,,386,4.803030303030303
