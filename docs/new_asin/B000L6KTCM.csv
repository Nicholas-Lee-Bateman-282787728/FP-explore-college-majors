2700631,5,B000L6KTCM,"Excellant coverage of the first days of LADS.
Having grown up at that strip it was fun to see it againe and share it with my kids and grandkids!",1255651200,2,144,4.0
2700632,5,B000L6KTCM,"This is where it all starts. The idea of a place where the kids of the day
can go race there hod rods, and a safe place at that.  The first drag race
strip built for drag racing. Even the local TV station went down to Lions
and had a live show at the strip in 1961. Way before it's time!
If you buy Volume 1, you better get 2 and 3!",1251158400,2,332,3.611111111111111

8160295,3,B000L6KTCM,"I raced my 59 Impala super stock and my 58 FI Corvette here in 1959/1960 and then some in 1966.  I loved this place with the open headers and blasting them on the return road.  I remember Danny the starter who used the FLAG  to set the racers off. I raced DuBar racing team and got a dyno tune from Dyno Don Nickolson after watching him chew up the competition here.  Cost one dollar to enter back then. Better than Irwindale for safety and less picky rules about NOTusing the terrible vacuum controlled factory linkage system on the 3 two barrel carb set up as it took too long to cut in and at top end vacuum dropped off and carbs would shut themselves! Oh yeah, the video, I like seeing those guys with the rails race again but would of loved to see more Super Stock and street machines, that was my scene.",1459296000,,809,4.233766233766234

8160298,5,B000L6KTCM,"A great DVD documenting quite a bit of what went on at LIONS after it opened. One of the truly great drag strips that I was fortunate to race at, during the very early days, where friends and I raced a blownChrysler AA/F dragster and then Super Stocks, starting with a '60 Chevy 348 4-speed, a '61 Pontiac 389 Super Duty and then switching to the Mopars... a '62 Plymouth 413 MaxWedge, a '64 Plymouth 426 MaxWedge and the wonderful '66 Plymouth Street HEMI, all of them blue-printed by services in Santa Monica where I lived at the time. I quit racing in 1966 as it was no longer a 'weekend warrior' event as the competition was now factory sponsered with very deep pockets. None the less, it was a great experience and certainly much different than todays drag racing events. All three DVD's are well done and certainly worth the cost, if you're a racer and interested in its history.",1437782400,,885,4.503105590062112

8160302,5,B000L6KTCM,"I grew up about a mile from the subject drag strip.  I used to walk over to it on weekends before I was able to own a set of wheels.  I remember race-cars like the ""Sidewinder"" which was my favorite of them all.  In those days a person could build their own dragster if they had some automotive knowledge and compete.  The Top Eliminator cars were a bit out of reach unless a person could have a group of persons of a state of mind as you had to spread out the cost.  But, it was within reach of the dedicated.  Lions was a gasoline only track for much of its history and I honestly think that when drag-racing made the switch to the fuelers they lost it.  Drag stips like Lions were built so that kids with hotrods could have a place to pursue their fun in as safe a place as they could find.  Get the kids off the street and onto a controled situation.  How well the ideal was achieved, I cannot really say as there was certainly a great deal of street-racing going on;  but, that is how it all started out.  Today there is no place that can accomidate anybody who wants to compete in a safe-and-sane manner.  They lost it.  To put a car on a dragstrip now days means you have to have tons of $$$$$.

So, Lions Drag-strip was the best of its kind and the three movies about the track does a great job of showing what is meant by the title:  ""The Greatest Drag Strip.""",1398124800,,1369,4.113207547169812
8160303,5,B000L6KTCM,"I had an interest in viewing this because I was a regular dragger there at Lions in the late 1950's, I had a 32 Ford 3 Window Coupe with a 54 Dodge V-8 with 2 4-Barrell Carbs, and with slickers on the back axle, fond memories of those days, and a great social gathering area too.  I was President of our local hot rod club too called the ""Rod Burners"", and we had a great team.  Attended Morningside High School in Inglewood.  Great documentary, and Amazon is the great online retailer in the U.S.  Thanks again.
