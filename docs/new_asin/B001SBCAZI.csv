3785376,2,B001SBCAZI,"That's right everybody, Uwe Boll has struck again.  The director known for adapting video games into horrible films such as House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and Blood Rayne is here again this time around with a take on Far Cry, and while the end result is nothing as bad as the previously mentioned films, it doesn't amount to a whole lot either.  Til Schweiger (Inglorious Basterds) stars as Jack Carver, an ex-soldier turned boat tour guide who, along with a reporter (Emmanuelle Vaugier) searching for her uncle (Ralf Moeller), are captured and taken prisoner on a remote, mysterious island where a mad scientist (Udo Kier) is conducting genetic experiments.  The action sequences are stale up until the end of the film, and while there also manages to be some surprisingly nicely done chase sequences (for a film by Boll that is), Far Cry still barely manages to be a step or two above ScyFy Channel quality for the most part.  The comedic moments that come about aren't funny one bit, but thankfully Schweiger plays it straight enough, and is probably the best leading man that has ever starred in one of Boll's films (please don't mention Jason Statham).  All in all, Far Cry is certainly not Boll's worst, but considering the fact that his recent flicks like Postal and Seed have shown us a better director is in there somewhere, this film is simply a disappointment, which more than likely isn't a surprise to anyone at all.",1259107200,4,1437,4.732
3785377,2,B001SBCAZI,"Look, Uwe Boll directed it and his track record isn't so hot, but even if you ignore any bias against the director it's still sloppy. The story is crammed together elements from the video game, the action sequences while set up to be awesome are filmed so carelessly that they lose all their impact, and the acting of course is garbage.

Of course, I wasn't expecting much out of the acting. It's an action film based on a hyperactive violent video game that I've actually had the pleasure of playing. The video game's story was a bit intriguing, though, so I did have some expectations out of that, although they weren't especially high.

Obviously, I watched Far Cry for the ACTION! Well, for the expectation of ACTION! Because Far Cry's action is certainly not an ALL-CAPS affair. There's a pretty cool SUV chase in the beginning and some acceptable shoot-outs at the end, but given the fact that you have to sit through the rest of the movie for these sequences they just aren't worth it.

If the pace had been ramped up a bit, this would have been a great little action flick. But it looks as if Boll thought he actually had a story to tell. I didn't play the video game for the story, why would I watch the movie for that? If I wanted the story I'd hop on wikipedia and just read the synopsis. I wanted visual visceral thrills in both cases. Which is why I played the game and why I made the mistake of watching the film.

I'm giving it two stars instead of one because despite the chase in the beginning and the frantic shootouts at the end being the only standout moments there was at least the tiniest bit of action and story to keep me watching. Not enough to warrant anything more and certainly not enough to warrant this film getting any money.

If you've got a really dull afternoon and can watch this film for free and are a general action film junkie regardless of the caliber of the film and are willing to sit through a whole film for a decent finale, well, sure go for it. I did it and at the very least I don't regret it.

But, seriously, that is A LOT of criteria to meet before you sit down and watch this, so by no means should you actually purchase this thing.",1258070400,6,2183,4.338235294117647

3785379,1,B001SBCAZI,"Uwe Boll...
What can we say about Uwe Boll? ""House of the Dead"" was one of the worst, darkest, most shameful moments in cinematic history. It was a terrible, abortion of a movie. It was a war crime, but harder to sell to the public. It was funny because it lacked any amount of talent in any aspect of film making. It was completely and utterly inept. Also, it was the best movie Uwe Boll has made.
I tried, honestly tried, to watch ""Far Cry"", it was too much. His movies aren't even funny anymore, it's legitimately sad to watch. It's like watching a mentally challenged person try to be the QB on a local football team; he's not good, but everyone humors him and his delusions.
This movie made me mad. It made me sincerely, and physically mad. It's pathetic. It's been a long time since I have hated something with every fiber of my being. It attempts scares, tension, action, and humor, and falls completely flat in every respect.
Watching this movie is like going on a first date with a hot girl who you think might be good for you only to have her be the most uninteresting person you have ever met... then she murders your mother (except it's not that interesting)
It is extremely seldom that I would wish physical violence on another human, but Uwe Boll...",1355356800,2,1263,4.448275862068965
3785380,2,B001SBCAZI,"It says a lot about director Uwe Boll's infamy that his adaptation of a video game as popular as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Far-Cry/dp/B0000A1VER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Far Cry</a>&nbsp;remains as obscure as it does, to the point that three years after its release, the DVD only has nine reviews on this website - ten, if you count mine. Having been burned just a few times too many, most viewers just don't seem to bother with his output anymore. It's a bit of a shame, since this is technically one of his better movies. It's still a flawed translation - turning the ""Far Cry"" franchise into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier/dp/B0002S94CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier</a>&nbsp;on an island - but it's predominantly just a fairly inoffensive action movie. It's boring, sure, but even that's an improvement for Dr. Boll.

The story: ex-special forces soldier Jack Carver (Til Schweiger,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inglourious-Basterds/dp/B002T9H2LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inglourious Basterds</a>) ferries journalist Valerie Cardinal (Emmanuelle Vaugier,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI-NY/dp/B001G0MFLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI: NY</a>) to a Canadian island in pursuit of a story that will lead them to discover the genetic experiments of a nefarious scientist (Udo Kier,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/0780624890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>).

I won't go on too much about the film's unfaithfulness to its source material, since the basic premise is surprisingly similar for a Boll flick, but just don't expect any mutated monsters -just pale soldiers with black eyes and super strength. It's a disappointing twist in a bland script notable only for how much ineffective humor it tries to deliver and a surprising number of purposely annoying side characters, most prominent among them Chris Coppola (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Postal/dp/B0019BI12I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Postal</a>) as Til Schweiger's sidekick in the second half of the film. The acting ranges from forgettable to disappointing: Udo Kier looks bored, Emmanuelle Vaugier is unmemorable, and Til Schweiger - one of the best actors to come from Germany - fumbles around with his English dialogue and what sounds like some painfully forced ad-libs. Urgh.

Uwe Boll's films are rarely light on action scenes, but the weakness of this one's story makes it the first to feel like the action is meant to be its actual centerpiece. There are at least a couple of these scenes with some merit: a car chase about thirty-five minutes in features some neat camera angles, and near the finale we get to see a decent parkour chase featuring Til Schweiger's stunt double. There's also a boat chase, a couple hand-to-hand fights, and a fair amount of gunfighting and explosions, but none of this is anything special, and cumulatively - despite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000GUJYI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>-esque aspirations - the action doesn't sustain itself in the long run. Production-wise, the film is clean but hindered by Boll's trademark handheld camerawork and a bit of inharmonious editing. There's not enough of this to make the movie awful, but it certainly doesn't do it any favors.

If I didn't know this was an Uwe Boll feature, I wouldn't have immediately guessed that it was. For folks who like his movies, this is a downer, and for folks who don't, it's but a marginal improvement to go from outright bad to just overlookable. Basically, it's not worth it: the high points aren't really worth waiting for and the low points aren't so low that they're entertaining. Leave it be.",1353888000,,3965,6.433395872420262
3785381,3,B001SBCAZI,"Far Cry (2008) is based on a video game of the same name, and is a low on logic, high on action type adventure.  Til Schweiger (Inglourious Basterds) is Jack Carver, an ex-special operations soldier, who now runs a charter boat, somewhere in the northern pacific area.  Seattle based journalist Valerie Cardinal (Emmanuelle Vaugier) hires Jack to take her to an island where she plans to meet with her uncle Max Cardinal (Ralf Moeller).  Max, an old friend of Carver, is working at a secret facility on the island, run by Dr. Lucas Krieger (Udo Kier), who is trying to develop some kind of super soldier.  Carver takes Valerie to the island, but armed mercenaries commanded by Katja Chernov (Natalia Avelon), capture Valerie and destroy his boat.  Carver strikes back boldly, rescuing Valerie, and then escaping in a wild chase that ends with a helicopter crashing into the water with Carver's vehicle attached.

A fantasy not meant to be taken seriously, the strength of the film is definitely the action and fighting scenes.  The tightly executed initial chase is probably the action highlight of the film, and features good interaction between Schweiger and Vaugier.  To add a few laughs, Carver is later teamed up with Emilo (Chris Coppola), ""the food guy"", for a nicely done boat chase sequence.  The big finish is an extended fight in the facility, that has some good moments.  Til Schweiger is quite good as the tough, brooding, silent type, but the attempts at humor fall a little flat most times.

Creation of an ultimate fighting machine has been done before (Universal Soldier comes to mind), and featuring white skinned ubersoldiers, Far Cry is just not that interesting.  With grand ambitions and a condescending attitude, Krieger is your stereotypical mad scientist type, with a textbook base of operations, where acts of war don't draw any attention.

For controversial director Uwe Boll (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tunnel-Rats/dp/B001ULAUF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tunnel Rats</a>), this is another film that like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BloodRayne/dp/B000EQ5V86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BloodRayne</a>&nbsp;(2005), is an adaptation of a video game.  It's not great, and the story does unravel at the end, but Far Cry is a competently executed action vehicle.

Boll and some of his production team provide a commentary track, that is semi-informative and also revealing.  Boll's comments are sometimes a bit too candid, but being a little off color is perhaps just Uwe being Uwe.",1283644800,6,2594,5.56234096692112
3785382,5,B001SBCAZI,"This is an awesome movie based on one of my most favorite video games, Far Cry.  It has good action, some humor, and it sticks pretty true to the original plot of the game.  Overall, it is a fun, lighthearted B-movie.

PLOT:  Former German special forces operator turned tour boat contractor  Jack Carver is hired by journalist Valerie Cardinal to transport her to an island.  Her contact has been feeding her information about a scientist named Dr. Krieger who is supposedly performing genetic experiments on humans.  Upon arrival Valerie is captured and Jack's boat blown up.  Now stranded, they must find a way to escape while fighting off mercenaries and Krieger's greatest creation:  genetically modified superhuman soldiers.

RANT:  I had never even heard of Uwe Boll before I was deciding wether or not to buy this movie.  I looked around the internet and this guy seems to get a lot of crap from raging fanboys.  Apparently he is hated because he takes video games and turns them into crap movies.  I haven't seen any of his other video game movies so I can't say if they are truly as bad as people claim.  He makes B-movies and you have to adjust your expectations when viewing these as they aren't supposed to be box office hits and are generally low budget.

 Far Cry is a great B-movie so I gave it five stars because it is highly entertaining and deserves at least three stars.  I'm still pleasantly surprised  that a Far Cry movie was even made at all.  Fans of the game should appreciate Boll's attempt at turning their game into a movie.  Wether you think that attempt was a good one or a bad one is up to you.  Watch it and judge for yourself.",1278720000,11,1660,4.555932203389831
3785383,1,B001SBCAZI,DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.  I am a big fan of the Far Cry games but this movie is crap.  Plus the only way they are gonna make any money off this movie is by sueing people.  Let them make their money that way since they can't make good movies.  For the sake of all the people being sued by these idiots DO NOT buy this movie.,1276473600,2,323,3.7761194029850746
3785384,2,B001SBCAZI,"Having played Far Cry and enjoyed the game's story, I had high expectations of this movie. Unfortunately, the writers didn't stay true to the original story, and the directing was below average at best.

This is the first film that I've seen by Director Uwe Boll, who apparently is a magnetic for criticism. So while I know virtually nothing about his past work, I do know that Far Cry came off as something shot for cable TV.

As far as the story, I was incredibly disappointed with the changes made to the original. Changing the setting from a South Pacific Island chain to the coast of Canada was the first mistake. It's bizarre that they make a point to keep Jack Carver in the same tropical shirt as the game, but in chilly Canada instead of the tropics. While Carver is portrayed by the experienced Til Schweiger, it makes absolutely no sense that the character was rewritten as a German soldier.

Emmanuelle Vaugier is exceptionally hot as Valerie Cardinal, but that does little to redeem the character being rewritten as a journalist instead of a secret agent. The biggest shame is that there are no Trigens in the film, only bulletproof mutant soldiers that look like seasick versions of the Incredible Hulk.

I'd hardly consider this film even worth a rental. If you're like me, and you enjoyed playing the original Far Cry game, you will more than likely dislike this movie. Which is a real shame, because the original story had so much potential.",1269216000,5,1458,4.705882352941177
3785385,3,B001SBCAZI,"Good actioner,i was never bored from it. The acting and special effects are what you would expect from a movie like this. I liked the chemistry between Emmanuelle Vaugier and Til Schweiger. I believe Emmanuelle Vaugier could have been used more though, her character was just playing the damsel in distress role. All in all, entertaining enough to see.",1268352000,2,352,4.983050847457627
3785386,1,B001SBCAZI,"I watched this because I am a big fan of the game. I just had to watch this, even though I had no expectations. Someone in reviews said that movies and games don't match. Well, the Thomb Rider wasn't bad at all, right? If this is what you thinking then snap out of it, because it ""ain't nothing like that"".

FarCry the movie was the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I did catch some no-name no-budget titles. I can't remember anything this bad. FarCry? Are you kidding me? Shot on some northern lake island (FarCry the game is about ""tropical paradise""). Max? Who the hell is Max? Who was that chick in black doing in the movie? ""Doctor Krieger"" kept repeating the same ""see for yourself"" for about ten minutes as if he forgot his lines?

All in all, the humor was all flat, and the action was slightly more lame than in a puppet show.

So, if you played FarCry, then don't let yourself to be fooled by this movie title. Tropic Thunder is much more
of a FarCry movie than this, seriously. Unfortunately there is no negative rating, so the least I can give is one star.

I am a sorry for Til Schweiger, he didn't deserve this.",1268265600,2,1133,4.330188679245283

Even a little on the poor side for a B movie. You know a movie is in trouble when you look at the out takes in the special
features and the out takes might well have been better than what they actually put in the film.

8339635,1,B001SBCAZI,"You know what's even worse than an Uwe Boll movie? An Uwe Boll movie where he tries to do COMEDY.

And unfortunately that is what Boll did in ""Far Cry,"" yet another loose adaptation of a video game. When he isn't boring his audience with awkward insta-romance and truly abysmal action scenes, Boll attempts to make us shoot ourselves with the least funny comedy I have ever seen. This is comedy that makes you cry instead of laughing.

Journalist Valerie Constantine (Emmanuelle Vaugier) has heard rumors of the evil scientist Dr. Krieger (Udo Kier) being holed up on a small island guarded by soldiers, and suspects something is amiss. Since she's an idiot, she has planted her uncle Max (Ralf M&ouml;ller) on the island as a spy. Yes, he does get caught.

So Valerie hires Jack Carver (Til Schweiger), an ex-Special Forces soldier who now gives boat tours, to take her to the island. But soldiers immediately attack them, blowing up the boat. And when they try to infiltrate Krieger's stronghold, they quickly discover that he has something worse than just genetic experiments: he's creating unstoppable supersoldiers.

As an action movie, ""Far Cry"" is actually somewhat better than most of Boll's wretched filmography, but that doesn't keep it from being brain-meltingly bad. There are giant chunks of the plot that are never explained (Carver refusing to admit he was ever a soldier), and massive continuity errors that sometimes occur within the SAME SCENE. Consider when we see a supersoldier's skin deflect a bullet... only to be pierced by a needle two minutes later. Oops.

But what sets this apart from dreck like ""Bloodrayne"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" is the comedy. Yes, Uwe Boll is trying to be funny. Intentionally funny. And it is DIRE.

This is the sort of comedy that toddlers are too sophisticated to appreciate, especially since Boll's idea of comedy is ""Hey! Here's a hideously annoying person! Laugh at how annoying they are!"" It's as funny as a quadruple bypass. We're treated to excruciatingly long scenes of irritating people whining and choking on sandwiches, which have no payoff or punchline except making the audience want to slit their wrists.

I'm also baffled by the casting of Schweiger as Jack Carver -- he's supposed to be a former Special Forces solder for the United States, but he speaks with a German accent that you could cut into slices. He's also sufficiently wooden that some of the zombielike supersolders manage to out-act him, and the whole point of his character denying his past is never even touched on. It's like Boll forgot it.

Emmanuelle Vaugier plays a bimbo ""journalist"" who bungles everything she touches because, teehee, she's a woman. Considering how all the other women in this movie are depicted, I smell a bit of sexism. And Chris Coppola is in this movie solely to screech ""I'm the food guy!"" and make Schweiger's Carver look like a plausible hero.

""Far Cry"" is an apt title for this movie -- it's a far cry from good filmmaking, especially because of the wretchedly unfunny comedy. It's not the worst fail of Uwe Boll's career, but it's still pretty dismal.",1366070400,,3118,4.879017013232514
