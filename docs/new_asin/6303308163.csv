7843117,5,6303308163,Purchased this VHS movie based on prior rolls that Joan Severance has played.  It did not disappoint.  This actress is one of the sexiest actresses ever.  This was a great erotic thriller and just as good as her acting in THE LAST SEDUCTION 2.  This movie is super hot and will keep you guessing.,1497139200,,296,4.425925925925926
7843118,3,6303308163,"This story is reasonably interesting, but the highlight is Joan Severance who lights up all her scenes--and has all the men in the movie interested in her. Worth the time to watch it.",1364515200,,183,4.575757575757576
7843119,5,6303308163,"This is a very good example of a ""film noir"" in which everyone is shady and no one can be trusted.  Also, I never tire of gazing at Ms. Joan Severance, so that is an added treat for me as well.",1264118400,,193,3.707317073170732
7843120,1,6303308163,"The other reviews of this movie are way too kind.  There is very little ""steam"" in this movie.  Not a bad plot, but let's be honest, that's not why we watch these direct to video / cinemax softcore movies.  Joan Severance does look good as usual.  However, the erotica scenes are few and far between and there is virtually nothing more revealing in the unrated version so don't spend your $ here.  Joan looks at her best putting on shiny white thigh highs underneath a tight yellow dress, but nothing happens with her and this luscious outfit.  A complete waste.  This is bound to disappoint so don't be misled by the other reviews.",1095379200,4,632,4.539823008849558
7843121,3,6303308163,"It's Joan Severance. Yeah, she's blonde in this one, but it's still Joan Severance. Black Scorpion. Need I say more? Three stars for the appearance by Joan Severance.",1061337600,,166,4.964285714285714
7843122,4,6303308163,"I am reviewing Joan Severance's ""Dangerous Indiscretion,"" also featuring devious Malcolm McDowell and C. Thomas Howell. A free spirit creative ad man, Howell sees Severance and after the predictable chase they couple. Severance's powerful hubby, evil McDowell finds evidence of the liasion & seeks to destroy Howell, beating Severance in the process. McDowell is ruthless. At same time he is trying to get zoning approval for a lakeside complex. There are lots of ruthless scenes along with some moments of tender love. Not typical sexploitation. Engaging plot, moves along, a few touching moments. 81 minutes. This is an enjoyable above average film that keeps flowing. Severance's acting rivals her beauty.  This is the VHS ""Dangerous Indiscretion.""  Clever uses of photo tampering shown. Howell's support lady is a doll. I highly recommend this film. Short, moving, engaging thriller.

7843123,3,6303308163,"The plot of this movie is pretty lame and standard. It's not a ba movie though. The only bad part is the end,it really sucked but pretty much the only way the movie could end. One warning though, if you are looking for a  happy ending where the guy walks away with the dough and the girl, you  won't find it here.  Other than that this movie is o.k, though slow. And  severance turned out to be a better actress than I thought.",955497600,2,427,4.108433734939759
