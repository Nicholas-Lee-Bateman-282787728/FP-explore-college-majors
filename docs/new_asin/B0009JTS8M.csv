It has in its content many personal interviews and testimonies, including testimonies from major leaders of the Mormon Church.  This is a great introduction to help people understand the beliefs and positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons).  In these presentations where I have shown this movie, I have had Mormons in the audience, and they never denied any of the content.  There were ex-Mormons who stood in tears to speak of personal experiences and told the audience to ""pay attention"" to this message.

This movie was released around 1980, so the technology behind it isn't as ""flashy"" as 2011; but the message is still powerful and truthful.",1292198400,18,780,4.961538461538462

We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.

We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.

We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.

We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.

We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.

We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.

We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.

We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.

We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.

We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.

2295901,3,B0009JTS8M,"To fully appreciate this work you have to first put in it and it's authors in their full 1983 (the original publication date) historic context.

I think that the early-1980's will be come to be considered a transition period by many Church Historians. The Jesus Movement of the 1970's was maturing as was the Charismatic Movement. Both Movements were mellowing and casting off some of the excesses of their infancies. At the same time the Vineyard movement had exploded on the scene bringing some new infant excesses to both challenge and refine the Church Universal. At the same time, traditional mainline denomination membership was beginning to see the first signs of decline as an interest in the more intimate, demonstrative worship of the Charismatic/Vineyard Churches and a unifying ""Evangelical"" Theology was diminishing denominational uniqueness.

However, some of the infantile excesses of all the above lingered.  Specifically the sensationalism of the ""Bible Thumping"" past was still in vogue. The memory of such best selling books as ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" (1970) and ""The Kingdom of the Cults"" (1965) dominated Christian Publishing. The popular Apocalyptic ""End Times"" preaching of Chuck Smith, Hal Lindsey and others was pulling in huge crowds and influenced many.  On the air TBN, PTL, ""The 700 Club"" and a whole host of radio personalities boasted audiences of literally millions (remember the Baaker and Swaggert scandals had not hit yet).

Finally, the boomers were hitting their late 20's and early 30's - looking back an awkward age where you know just enough to be dangerous and not nearly enough to be truly wise. As a result, I recall that the spirit of the age was still very much ""in your face"", idealistic and rather judgmental.

On the popular culture side, shows like ""That's Incredible!"" were all the rage.

In a nutshell, sensationalism was ""in"", ""good scholarship"" and ""reason"" was viewed skeptically. In fact, the scholarship of the day could generally best be described as ""good enough, is good enough!"" And please remember this was in an age where Personal Computers were only available to a small segment of the population of and the Internet was only known in government and academic settings. ""Nuanced"" was a word that you looked up in the dictionary rather than lived - everything was either ""black or white"" or ""us versus them"". Not a dark age, just another human age and one that contains many lessons for us today.

Ed Decker and Dave Hunter were unquestionably influenced by all this (just read their other books from this period compared to their recent work) and, therefore, wrote a book on Mormonism that is sensational, abrasive, and lacking in a high degree of scholarship. Yes, they overstate things A LOT. Yes, they miss nuance again, again, and again. Yes, they exaggerate. Yes, their writing and film documentary style can best be described as ""National Enquirer"". Yes, they are often unkind, insensitive and downright mean. Yes! Yes! Yes! All true.

However, for the time it could have been A LOT worse! (Trust me on this one - I was there)

Is this the first book that I would pick up and read on Mormonism? Not now, but it was back then and I benefited greatly from the overview despite it's flawed style. The message that they bring is objectively and empirically true.  Unfortunately the style that that message was delivered in is rather ugly and unappealing.  So this is another sad case where bad judgment overshadows good intention and reasonable content.

Personally, I prefer the following ""Starter"" books on Mormonism:

Many Mormons would actually be quite surprised at the contents of this tape as they are not all fully aware of the deeper doctrines of their denomination.

They are not alone. Decker's activities as a professional opponent of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been highly visible (and audible) for years, and he has bestowed upon the world such signal contributions as ""Ex-Mormons for Jesus"" and the movie The God Makers.

2295922,3,B0009JTS8M,"This DVD was not a surprise since I already know that Mormonism is a cult, based on the lie that men can become like gods, which is the lie that Satan seduced Eve into believing in the Garden of Eden, contributing to the fall of man into sin and separation from the Creator.

The two main characters in this DVD tried to convince lawyers to represent them in a suit against the Mormon Church for its deceitful twisted theology, the stranglehold on its members, and the families destroyed by the Mormon Church.  The plaintiffs did not convince the lawyers to represent them; however, the setting used between the plaintiffs and the lawyers gave opportunity for the plaintiffs to present heart-breaking accounts of families and lives destroyed by the Mormon church, interviews with Mormon leaders along with dramatizations of the occult, secretly guarded, Mormon temple rituals.

A couple of Mormons came by the house and we had several discussions about their beliefs.  I reconized in the beginning that their beliefs were different from traditional christian teachings.  AsI began to read the Book og Mormons, I had more questions than the missionaries had answers.  The invited one of their more knowlegable missionaries  to help explain their beliefs.  When asked about historical information such as horses in north america before Christ time when I knew that the Spanish had introduced the horse to North America after Columbus, and they claim that the native Indians were decendents of the Jews but DNA disproves this.  Also the Jews who came over here were suposed to have knowlege of metals and the wheel, but the native Indians were still in the stone age.  That is when they started to talk of the burning in the bossum, and if it was written in he Book of Mormon, it had to be true.  As a result of this, I began to research the Mormon religion.
