455498,3,6302344891,"The Winning Team is a biography about pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander (Ronald Reagan), a baseball player afflicted by an early injury. He was considered to be one of the greatest pitchers of all time, but a long absence from the sport was blamed on his addiction to drink, when really he had fainting spells and double vision. His triumphant return won the Cardinals the World Series during the Depression.

The happy ending is not entirely factual, but in the 50s, audiences wanted sugar-coated movies. And that is what they got. The formula causes The Winning Team to be a bit predictable, but enjoyable. This is one of Doris Day's early films, but it is really Reagan's film. He plays the part with realism, toggling between the exuberance of winning and the depths of alcoholism.",1238371200,10,786,4.865671641791045
455499,5,6302344891,"This is one of those lesser known Doris Day movies, with the added feature of her sharing the screen with a future U. S. President.  Few are aware of the interesting story of Grover Cleveland Alexander, the Hall of Fame pitcher, who overcame a sports induced vision impairment (leading to epilepsy), a battle with alcohol and other challenges to pitch ""back to back"" victories in the 1926 World Series then coming in late in the seventh and final game to seal the victory and propel the Cardinals to the championship.  Sportswriter Grantland Rice called Cleveland, ""the finest (pitcher) I have ever seen"".
Filmed principally on the Warner Bros, back lot, a local Burbank ball field, and the Warner's location ranch, now Calabasas, California, it offers a somewhat nostalgic look at filming of the 1950's era.
A good bet for a rainy night's viewing.",1238112000,2,848,4.923076923076923

so I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this picture, but it was
actually pretty good.  Some of the acting was the best I've
seem from her, but it seemed like someone told her to act like
June Allyson,...who I like, but it was annoying comming from
Doris.  Reagan was likeable, and the chemistry was good between
them.  Even though it was more serious than the other movies I
had seem from Doris, there were still a few musical numbers, and
smashing of lips called kissing. It's worth viewing if you like
Doris Day, and can sit through a baseball movie.",1218844800,3,616,4.385964912280702
455501,5,6302344891,"The Winning Team is about real life Baseball great, Grover Cleveland Alexander.  Ronald Reagan puts in one of his best performances. Even though Warner Bros didn't allow the word ""epilepsy"" to be used in the film (which is what happened to the real Alexander after being beamed in the head with a ball),RR does some very realistic seizures.  The Winning Team refers to the mutually supportive relationship between Alexander and his loving wife Aimee (Doris Day). (The real Aimee Alexander served as the film's technical adviser). This isn't one of the meatiest roles for Doris, but she does have some dramatic scenes and gets to sing a Christmas song. The script rearranges the chronology of Alexander's life,and suggests incorrectly that he struck out Babe Ruth in the last game when in fact, Babe was thrown out for stealing 2nd base.",1217635200,12,836,4.964285714285714

455503,5,6302344891,"The subject of ""The Winning Team"" is Grover ""Old Pete"" Alexander, the winningest pitcher in National League history despite having to battle various setbacks most notably alcoholism.  As a fan of the Philadelphia Phillies I thought the film gave his tenure here short shrift so here goes:  Alexander won 30 games three years in a row(1915-1917), in 1916 he pitched 16 shutouts, in 1915 he won the first game of the World Series a feat not repeated by a Phillies pitcher until 1980(the championship year.  Yay!).  I digress, however.  As a baseball film it's superb.  The film has the facts right and the game footage, whether re-enactments or archival film, add to the authenticity of the production.  The film slightly falters in the more melodramatic moments but do not embellish far from the truth.  Alexander did suffer head injuries in World War I and did resort to alcoholism to combat the pain.  He also denigrated himself by appearing at flea circuses when it appeared that his major league career was over.  Ronald Reagan makes a genial Alexander and handles the film's melodramatic fluorishes superbly.  Doris Day adds fresh faced All-American girl wholesomeness as Alexander's supportive wife Aimee.  The film utilizes major league players in supporting roles including Gene Mauch, manager of the 1964 Phillies who blew a 6 1/2 game lead with 12 games to go(boo!).  As a footnote, Alexander attended the 1950 World Series between the Phillies and the Yankees.  He was living in relative obscurity in a flophouse and died shortly after the Series.",1156723200,28,1557,5.03125

455505,4,6302344891,"When ""The Winning Team"" hit theatres in 1952, moviegoers gave it an enthusiastic welcome.  Doris Day, billed first, was the top moneymaking star at Warner Brothers and Ronald Reagan was nearing the end of his contract run at that studio.
The pair had briefly dated some years before, and they clearly evidence an on-screen chemistry which propels this tale of the late, great pitcher, Grover Cleveland Alexander, to a near homer.
While it may play lose with some of the facts surrounding ""Alex the Great's"" life, toning down his drinking problems and virtually ignoring his epilepsy, the resultant film is a well crafted, lovingly enacted story that will please a variety of audiences including those who enjoy baseball tales and those who prefer some homespun Hollywood biography.
This smartly directed story pretty much limits its scope to the years during which Alex and his wife Aimee were courting and married. The popular standard, ""I'll String Along with You"" is utilized as part of the film's score during many scenes involving the pair. Although not actually written at the time the story takes place it is nevertheless poignant and sweet.
Ronald Reagan clearly worked hard at his role in this film.  He delivers one of his most convincing performances and capably displays the many layers behind the great pitcher with heartfelt feeling and emotion. As noted earlier, his chemistry with Doris Day is never forced or artificial but seems to be completely real in every way.
Few actresses could play wife and/or mother with the conviction of Doris Day.  In the 40's, 50's, 60's, or 70's, she consistently and with subtlety played such roles in a real and completely believable fashion. She never resorts to sacchrrine sweetness or cloying mannerisms.  Although only in her 20's when making this film, she displays a natural maturity and warmth as well as strength of character that gives the role of Aimee more complexity than it may appear to have on the surface. One shudders to imagine what the role would have been in the hands of someone like June Allyson or Debbie Reynolds.
During their marriage and the ups and downs that occurred with frequency, Aimee becomes a force behind Alex's comebacks and renewed success.  While never diminishing Alex's own strengths and skills, Aimee is, nonetheless, a presence in his life that he can always turn to with certainty.
The supporting cast is fine headed by the always reliable Frank Lovejoy, turning in another fine performance. Baseball scenes are interlaced with real footage, and staged with excitement and an obvious love for that most American of sports.
""The Winning Team"" is the perfect antidote to livening up anyone's day. This is one ball game you should be happy to be taken out to!",1019088000,34,2751,4.984749455337691

But THE WINNING TEAM, sanitized and dramatized though it was for 1950s consumption, makes for a heartwarming time in front of the screen. Doris Day gets top billing, but it's Ronald Reagan who, as that great Nebraskan hurler, Grover Cleveland Alexander, capably assumes the focus of this biopic. Word has it that Reagan, an avid sports enthusiast, desperately wanted to play another memorable pitcher, Monty Stratton, in an earlier film except that Jimmy Stewart trumped him and landed that role.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stratton-Story/dp/B000FTCLRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stratton Story</a>&nbsp;was well regarded enough that the Grover Cleveland Alexander project was greenlit, and Reagan got to play a professional baseballer. He turns in a thoroughly sympathetic performance. Playing his understanding wife, Doris Day, pretty and wholesome enough to make Norman Rockwell pant, matches Reagan in sheer likability. They both get to test out their dramatic chops. They handle their business.

3.5 out of 5 stars, which means I like this film, never mind that some facts were glossed over or tweaked. I guess there was a stigma regarding afflictions such as epilepsy back in the day (when, I guess, men were ridiculously rugged and smoked Marlboros with world-weary swagger), and the film reflects this macho outlook. Heck, Alexander himself reflected this. Rather than be viewed as someone with a debilitating condition, he'd rather that people believed him a drunkard (which he was, also). The film omitted mention of Alexander's true medical condition, opting instead to present Alexander's malady as a recurring series of fainting spells and double vision.

Alex the Great may hail from Nebraska but he was never cut out to be a farm boy (or a telephone lineman, for that matter). Alex the Great (or ""Old Pete"") was a power pitcher, and he racked up heaps of milestones and records in his career. Inarguably, his signature moment surfaced during the 1926 World Series when his Cardinals went up against the juggernaut New York Yankees which at that time fielded immortals like Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Murderer's Row, they called them Yankees. Not only did Alexander pitch two complete (and winning) games (Games 2 and 6), but, in Game 7, with his team up a precarious 3 runs to 2 in the seventh inning, he was called out of the bullpen to hold off a crucial Yankees rally, with two outs and the bases loaded. He went on to keep the Yankees scoreless for two more innings, sealing the game and winning the Cardinals the World Series. That day, it was the Yankees fans who threw a fit (sorry).

And, for you old school baseball buff, throughout the film, the camera treats you to cameo appearances by big leaguers like Gene Mauch, Bob Lemon, Peanuts Lowrey, and Hank Sauer. We get to eyeball the likes of Ruth and Gehrig in the movie's archival footage. So, if you're jonesing for turn-of-the-century nostalgia and you're a fan of our favorite national pastime, then THE WINNING TEAM makes for an ideal convergence. Doris Day even sings a Christmas song.",1334880000,2,4070,6.024179620034542

Somehow, however, I never saw this movie before now.  I have never been a real fan of Ronald Reagan (as far as his acting ability) but I was pleasantly surprised at how natural he was in this film and how good he was at expressing so many heart-felt emotions.

The reason I bought this film in the first place is that my birth father is in it!  He is one of the opposing team players and he had three closeups...up at bat ... in the movie.  He was so gorgeous, and young!  I have not seen him in 40 years and do not even know if he's still alive, but seeing him on my television made me feel very special.

I am also a huge fan of Frank Lovejoy and also enjoy Doris Day.  Ronald Reagan was the best President we have had in over almost 200 years.  The best part is that the movie was a true story and is a large part of baseball history.  I enjoyed watching it very much.,1285372800,2,413,3.9878048780487805
455711,5,6302344891,"I caught a small portion of this film on TV and enjoyed it so much that I had to see the entire movie, so I bought it.  I'm very glad that I did.  It's very cool to see Reagan teamed up with an A-list actress such as a young Doris Day.  Being around other great actors seems to bring out the best performances by Mr. Reagan.  The story is about Grover Cleveland Alexander, a Major League pitcher who was very successful in the early days of baseball.  Alexander has epilepsy which causes his pitching to suffer, which leads to other downfalls.  The movie makers didn't want to use the word epilepsy in the film, so it's never mentioned.  Reagan thought they should say it, to inform the audience what epilepsy is about, and to put a human face on it.  One must remember this was the early 1950's, and movie companies were probably afraid people would be turned off by a film that deals with a main character with epilepsy.  Maybe not too different than film companies today that are overly politically correct so as to not offend anyone, anywhere, anyhow.
  Nonetheless, the storyline is very well written, and the acting is really top notch!  This is certainly one of my favorite baseball movies, along with Pride of the Yankees, The Natural, Field of Dreams and a few others.  I strongly suggest this movie to any baseball fan, or fan of Doris Day or Ronald Reagan.",1283126400,4,1367,4.508130081300813
455712,3,6302344891,"He's Grover Cleveland Alexander, one of the great pre-World War I pitchers who consistently won 30 or more games. He's somewhat forgotten in a time that is out of the memory of anyone alive today. Film footage is scant. The aftermath of  World War I wasn't kind. He continued to pitch well at times but undiagnosed injuries from the war left him with epilepsy & an alcohol problem. It was reported that Reagan voiced concern that the movie did not point out that it was epilepsy that led to the drinking that contributed to his decline. The producers of the movie could not even bring themselves about to utter the word epilepsy. Reagan was left to play Alexander as what appeared to be a drunk. No denying that this Hall of Famer was one of the best pitchers ever. The movie rolls through the baseball part of his life effortlessly. Doris Day was his wife, at first dubious of his desire to pitch but later is his most ardent fan. She was attempting to show producers that she could do serious roles. He is compared in the movie to the great New York favorite, Christie Matthewson, his only equal of the the time who was also injured in the war. He makes a final comeback appearance that is of course, heart-warming & ties up the movie. I'm always dubious about such a neat ending. But this is an average, good, Ronald Regan movie.

Doris, of course, is her sweet self and Ronald's own personality (as seen the book ""I love you, Ronnie"") shines through in the man he portrays so well.  This is a very classic film biography.  If you don't like baseball, autobiographies, etc. it's not for you.  It is NOT a big romance (chick movie) - although the love between the two is evident.  I would definitely recommend it for classic film buffs as well as Day and Reagan fans.",1265587200,3,786,4.571428571428571
455714,4,6302344891,"I'd seen this pic several times over the years, prior to getting this CD. I've always enjoyed baseball bios, even though we know all of them have been embellished. And, being a Reagan fan from way back (especially in 'Kings Row') I had to get this one. Sure, the acting is standard fare but..well..it's baseball! Seeing William Bendix, Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart, etc. play all the old ballplayers from before my time gave me a sense of the timelessness of baseball. I think Ronnie did a good job, he sold me on wanting to know more about Grover Alexander and, hundreds of other players as well. We need more bios, all sports!",1252368000,4,626,4.598214285714286
455715,4,6302344891,This movie is based on the life of Grover Cleveland Alexander who was from South Central Nebraska.  I personally am from the same area and really enjoyed hearing the names of some of the small local towns in our area on a movie.  Ronald Reagan and Doris Day were great and the movie is fun to watch.,1250985600,,299,4.228070175438597
455716,4,6302344891,"Grover Cleveland Alexander - the subject of this movie - was a remarkable pitcher and lived a very interesting life in an era in which baseball sported the most colorful people in its history: the early 1900s.

Some of stories about them, like this one, are very inspiring, too, although they end this bio on Alexander's high note not his real-life tragic demise - but what's wrong with that? People want to leave the theater feeling good, not depressed.

Ronald Reagan does a decent job portraying ""Alex,"" except for the baseball scenes where he doesn't throw or hit like a real big-leaguer. That was common in classic sports films. This is corny in spots and it's sugar-coated like some of the other classic sports stories.

However, all is not sweet as Alexander is shown with his drinking problem and his wife, played by Doris Day, also walks away from her husband in his time of need.....so you do see some bad with the good. Yet, all ends well",1244246400,,949,4.636904761904762

7824749,3,6302344891,"I had a hard time getting over, through or around  Ronald Reagan's ""terrible"" acting. Let's start  with the fact that R.R. was in his forties when this movie was made. He was portraying a baseball hero that was actually in his late twenties- early thirties at the time of the story and R.R. was not convincing at all. This movie is based on a ""real and true story"" of an American baseball hero in the 1920's for that reason it is worth seeing.",1502928000,,443,4.325301204819277
