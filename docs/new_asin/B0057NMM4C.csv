4597434,4,B0057NMM4C,"I bought this movie b/c I loved Kel Mitchell from back in the day.  The trailer looked pretty crazy, so I decided to check it out.  The characters in this movie are crazy and Kel doesn't disappoint with his character Pretty Eyed-Willy....a cross between Dave Chappelle and Prince.  He's actually the good guy and the bad guy. The scenes with Tommy Davidson (crackhead) are also pretty funny.  If you're looking for some brainless, random fun, then check this out.",1319500800,,463,4.822784810126582
4597435,1,B0057NMM4C,"Do not waste your time and money on this Film. I heard Cedric the Entertainer on the Steve Harvey show pushing this movie.  I am so disapponted that so many talented actors agreed to lower their standards and actually make this silly, Saturday Morning Cartoon Movie.  Maybe the kids may get it but I did not.",1319414400,2,308,4.482142857142857
4597436,5,B0057NMM4C,"A silly spoof on Kung Fu and Dance movies, DANCE FU is full of insane characters, jokes, and gags.  All star cast includes Kel Mitchell (Keenan & Kel), Katerina Graham (Vampire Diaries), Affion Crockett, Tommy Davidson, and of course Cedric The Entertainer.  This is the kind of movie that actually gets more funny with time & repeated viewings!  If you love Kung Fu movies, sweet beats and crazy dance moves, grab a cold one or your favorite herbal remedy and check out DANCE FU!!",1317772800,9,481,4.7023809523809526
4597447,5,B0057NMM4C,A TRULY HILARIOUS FARCE OF THE KUNG-FU GENRE! THE MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTLEY ABSURD AND THAT WAS THE SECRET OF IT'S HILARITY!,1355184000,,119,4.714285714285714
4597448,3,B0057NMM4C,"This movie was ridiculous.  And often funny.  Combining parodies of the kung fu and dance movie genres the story is about Chicago Jones, a man who was born to dance and not fight, getting mixed up in trying to obtain justice for his murdered uncle.  Hard to do when you can't fight and your evil foe is the likes of ""Pretty Eyed Willy"", an eyepatched facial-haired Outkast wannabee with a glove that does MJs one better (he can literally slap somebody into next week!!!), and PEW's whacked out henchman.  Chicago is rescued from certain death by a sage kung fu master who can't seem to teach his student how to fight only to learn that he doesn't need to because Chicago can give up a boogie beat down to the worst of them as long as he's listening to music...or to the universe or whatever else creates natural beats.  There is, of course, a love interest side story with a very pretty girl whose face was familiar but my wife and I just couldn't place her (Kat Graham).  Pretty Eyed Willy had one obnoxious voice setting: loud, and was played by Kel Mitchell who also played Chicago Jones (I never knew until I looked it up on IMDb).  So, Mitchell kicks his own a** in this movie!

Directed by Cedric the Entertainer (weird last name that), and because of this he makes a cameo (gets paid twice that way), the movie is fairly innocuous and slightly offensive (it's not going for offensive), especially with Tommy Davidson's crack addict character.  (He really needs to get a new schtick and leave In Living Color back in the 90s.)  In the same parodic vein as the ""Scary Movie"" movies et. al. it is an enjoyable trifle that will give especially the teenage set a few giggles and a few groans.  3.5 stars.",1349222400,,1706,4.488673139158576
4597449,4,B0057NMM4C,"As a comedy lover who grew up watching def comedy jam and loving the Martin dhow, I found this to be pretty funny. Kel Mitchell is best remembered from the Nickolodean shows Kenan and Kel and All that, as well ass Goodburger (which kind of was a bad movie but not the worst.) This is one of his many independent efforts and for a low budget movie the acting and editing was pretty good. The Movie is about a sensitive, street dancer (Kel) who lives with his uncle(guy who plays villian in all those Tyler Perry movies). The uncle is a club owner and popular amongst the neighborhood, his biggest performer at the club is Shocka, a pretty singer(Kat Graham from Vampire Diaries) who's also Kels characters love interest. Things are going good until a metro sexual, narcissist thug named Pretty Eyed Willy (also played by kel) wants to take over the uncles club since his own clubs popularity has declined. There's appearances from Cedric The Entertainer as a cluless sherrif, Tommy Davidson as a crackhead and a few other familiar faces as well. The movie in my opinion was good overall, it spoofed a few classics like Purple Rain, The karate Kid,and Berry Gordys: The Last Dragon. There are some harsh reviews on here but if you've seen any of Kels other efforts you'd get that this was not meant to win a Oscar or SAG award, it's for pure entertainment purposes only. I can definately see Kel mitchel becomming this generations Martin Lawrence! Take a chance, for $6 what can you lose? or at least rent it from netflix.",1338854400,,1520,4.612546125461255
4597450,1,B0057NMM4C,"The acting was bad. The story was bad. The guy with the eye patch was constantly screaming.  Do not buy this movie even if it was on sale!!!! Was this supposed to be a comedy/action - no one laughed when we watched it. I was hoping that there was something relevant in the movie, so we tried to watch it till the end, but there was nothing.....what a waste of our time! Argghh!",1337731200,,377,4.164383561643835
4597451,4,B0057NMM4C,"You know what Kel is silly in this movie and the fact that him and Cedric produce this movie you already know it was a funny mess, I am tired of my children running through the house talking about One-Eyed Willy , lol",1326931200,,217,4.069767441860465
4597452,5,B0057NMM4C,"A well constructed, intellectually profound, and thought provoking movie unrivaled by any other films of it's time. Original crisp humor that had me laughing well beyond the credits. Kel Mitchell shows he is capable of writing with the best of them with this complex story line that will keeping you guessing throughout the whole movie. A must see for a fan of such movies as Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gone With The Wind, and To Kill A Mockingbird. A novelization of this movie would do well to teach the children of America many life lessons and I will be pushing for it at the next PTA meeting for my son's school. Now that I have seen this movie I feel as if my life is now more complete. This is the kind of movie that will draw you in and make you regret blinking. Buy Dance Fu!",1325376000,7,783,4.36986301369863

4597454,1,B0057NMM4C,"I absolutely HATE this movie, just got it a couple of weeks ago and already I am trying to sell it.  I brought it on blind faith, simply because I am a fan of Cedric the entertainer, but this movie sucks.  DO NOT BUY IT....unless you like terrible movies that are not funny and make no sense.  Waste of time and money indeed.",1322784000,,325,4.126984126984127
4597455,5,B0057NMM4C,"Cedric The Entertainer out did himself with this movie. The BEST thing that he could have done is make Kel Mitchell the star. Kel is naturally hilarious and playing the character Pretty Eyed Willie just brought all of that natural talent out in spades.

This movie had me in the floor laughing. I watched it 5 times in the first two days that I had it.

If you love stupid humor like I do, you will love this movie.

I rank it up there with WAITING, STILL WAITING, STRANGERS WITH CANDY, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, DUMB & DUMBERER (When Harry Met Lloyd).",1321660800,,550,4.320388349514563
4597456,2,B0057NMM4C,"i was expecting this to be really funny....especially since it had Cedric The Entertainer and Tommy Davidson.......but was sadly mistaken....i really , really did want to like this....i tried to laugh at certain parts, but if u have to try and laugh..its not worth it.....**sigh**",1320537600,,280,5.2444444444444445

8460994,3,B0057NMM4C,"I bought this for one reason: Katerina Graham, who is as gorgeous as always and gets 5 stars just for that. The movie...tries to be a send-up of Kung Fu - as well as dance movies, neither of which it does well, most of the humor is very primitive - with occasional and possibly unintentional flashes of brilliance - the acting is either non-existent or so over the top, they can't even see the top in the rearview, the martial arts moves make Hong Kong Ninja flicks look realistic, and the dancing happens only a few times and for very brief periods of time. 1 star for the film, being generous. Split the difference, make it 3.",1428364800,,628,4.3760683760683765

8460997,5,B0057NMM4C,"i had no idea of what i was buying, i thought it was gonna be another low budget movie with bad acting & plot, but i was wrong it's a really funny movie to watch, there is no boob shots in it like what all these hollywood movies have, it's great to watch with your kids or other adults, not gonna tell you about the movie other than that it was really funny & i'm glad that i bought it.
it's really funny urban comedy.",1384732800,,418,3.929411764705882

This is one of my favorite movies and will watch it until I can not watch again. It is hilarious and that crazy,stuid, silly funny; which I love! Yes I would recommend this especially if you need a laugh!",1374969600,,318,4.063492063492063

My husband and I are usually into the stupid funny movies, but this was just stupid. Don't waste your money!",1356652800,,274,4.392156862745098
8461002,4,B0057NMM4C,"If not for Kel Mitchell or Cedric the Entertainer being involved with this I wouldn't have given this movie a second thought. This is now my new guilty pleasure. I had a feeling this movie was going to be overly silly, but once I started watching it I was amazed at how silly and ridiculous this movie was. It has a lot of satire elements in this movie added with some crazy and often funny moments throughout. Needless to say I watched this crazy flick 3 times since I first seen it and parts of it are still stuck in my head. This movie does not shy away from how ridiculous it is and I guess that is the beauty of it. Some movies are just outlandish and leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterwards. This just leaves you with some lasting chuckles making you think 'whatdid I just watch and why am I still laughing' To Ced and Kel, Thanks.",1356566400,,841,4.197530864197531
