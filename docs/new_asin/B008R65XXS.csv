5178828,3,B008R65XXS,I really enjoyed the Perfect Getaway movie - rated a 5.  The other two are not very good - rate a 2.,1387152000,,100,3.5454545454545454
5178829,4,B008R65XXS,"I am not crazy about The Last House on the Left, not because I felt the movie wasn't well done, but because it is just a bit harsh for my taste, I felt the same way about the original. But I have to say that The Strangers and The Perfect Getaway are really guilty pleasures of mine.

""The Strangers"" is a really well done nightmare scenario that many people fear. A couple is alone one night  in a suburban home and ends up being  terrorized by a group of random ""strangers"" for no reason whatsoever. This has a real ring of truth to it and that's what makes it so scary.

""The Perfect Getaway"", on the other hand, really makes it clear how perception is everything. This movie stars several great actors, including Steve Zahn, Timothy Olyphant and Chris Hemsworth. Considering the quality of the actors, the director, and the story, I am very surprised this did not do better.

Anyway, if you have not seen these films it is really a no brainer to pick up this set for the price.",1370476800,5,980,4.362637362637362
5178830,5,B008R65XXS,I enjoyed all three movies for the price of one. Now how can you beat that. Movies are better on Blu-ray !!!!,1370217600,,109,4.0

The Last House On The Left: At a remote house there's a couple with their teen daughter, after settling in the daughter and her friend go into town and meet up with a young man who turns out to be part of a gang lead by a very disturbed killer. This killer had just escaped the capture of two detectives who meet a very brutal demise at the hands of this gang, so it's not hard to figure out what happens next. The daughter is sexually assaulted and killed, the friend is shot while trying to swim away but somehow makes it back to the house of the couple.

Once a rainstorm hits the gang seeks refuge in the couple's house and the parents soon realize after their daughter's friend tells them that this gang killed their daughter. This is where the real fun begins, as the parents devise ways to inflict harm and death on the members of the gang, with the real payoff coming at the end. The violence is at times brutal and the scene where the daughter meets her end is kinda hard to watch. However it is fun to watch if you enjoy horror flicks. **1/2 out of 4 stars. Starring Monica Potter (""Along Came A Spider"") and Tony Goldwyn (""The Mechanic"")

The Strangers: Liv Tyler (""Armageddon"") and Scott Speedman (""Underworld"") are a young couple that leave a wedding reception and come to a remote cabin where they decide to have a night of romance even though they appear to be at odds and their relationship is strained. Well that all changes after an early morning knock at their door, some young girl asks something, they turn her away and the events that follow see the couple fighting back against 3 masked killers who intend to attack, torture and eventually kill the couple. It's a very enjoyable horror flick as the tension builds during the earlier scenes and especially during a scene where Speedman's brother comes to the cabin to look for Scott and Liv. It's one of my personal favorites. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.

A Perfect Getaway: In Hawaii on a hike in a remote beach area we see a young couple, Cydney (Milla Jovovich, ""The Fifth Element"") and her Cliff (""Joy Ride"") overhear that there are some killers on the loose after police find some people murdered somewhere close to them. Obviously they are terrified to hear this and even suspect two other hikers Nick (Timothy Olyphant, TV's ""Justified"") and Gina (Kiele Sanchez, ""Redemption Road"") who suggest they should hike together due to the killers being somewhere around them. This is a bit of an odd one, especially some of the I guess you could call them flashbacks between Cydney and Cliff, but the horror and scares do keep the pace up and even the performance by the main actors are good and fit with this type of movie. **1/2 out of 4 stars.

This is definitely a collection worth getting for the right price, can't beat three fun, cheesy but also good horror flicks.",1367107200,,2859,4.543689320388349

I had bought this collection because I had wanted to see ""the strangers"" and found the movie very creepy, definitely a movie to watch to increase your paranoia.  The Last House on the Left, not a real fan of rape scenes, but it is actually a decent movie with a good story and good acting.  A Perfect Getaway, decent story and would not be opposed to having to watch it again.  With all the horror movies I have bought this halloween these are actually in the top 10.  Next Halloween I'll probably have these in my playlist.",1476576000,,701,4.488188976377953
