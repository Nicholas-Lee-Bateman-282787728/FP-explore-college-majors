1414871,5,B00005ALN0,"Hey Sailor Moon fans!!  This video has four of the best episodes.  It begins with ""Sailor V Makes the Scene"" where a fake sailor moon is rampaging around the city stealing all of Serena's glory!  In this episode we are introduced to a new Negaverse Creep Malachite and the 5th sailor scout Venus who ends up saving the day.  Darien is tricked by Zoicite, and gets badly hurt.  OH, NO! In the next episode ""Crystal Clear Destiny"" Darien and Serena finally reveal their shocking identities to each other. Zoicite and Darien were going to have a duel for the rainbow crystals, but Zoicite tricks him and Malachite steals the crystals.  When Zoicite nearly kills Tuxedo Mask, the rainbow crystals leave from Malachite and become one in front of Sailor Moon.  The Imperium Silver Crystal is revealed, and the Moon Princess is Serena!  In the next episode ""A Reluctant Princess""  Serena is totally overwhelmed and doesn't think she can handle all the responsibility that comes with being a princess.  She just wants to be a normal teenage girl.  The Negaverse takes Tuxedo Mask, and tries to wipe out all of his memories that he regained with sailor moon.  Serena ends up showing her real power when Malachite tries to attack her.  And Queen Beryl kills Zoicite.  The final episode is called ""Bad Hair Day"".  Serena takes the Tuxedo Mask dilema really harsh!  She doesn't even eat! Can you believe that?  Mina tries to cheer her up by going to a Salon for free hair cuts.  And Serena wants to chop off those ""meatballs"" on the top of her head.  An evil Negaverse monster is revealed, and Tuxedo Mask shows up!  Is he friend or foe?  Find out in this tape of four great episodes!",994032000,7,1672,4.638225255972697
1414872,5,B00005ALN0,I know thats its such a bummer that Secret Identities is out of stock. I was so disappointed I was really looking forward to watching the episodes when Serena reveils her secret identity in front of Darien. But when I got this ideo boy was I full of luck. It ended up that these two episodes were in this video plus it also had two more episodes in this video that really rocked. Th first one is when Zocite tries to get Darien to give up the rainbow crystals by dressing up as the fake sailor moon. The last one is when the first time that the sailor scouts find out that Darien was brainwashed to be one the Negaverse side. I totally enjoyed this video and I think you will too so buy this video!!!,991785600,4,700,4.154411764705882

7935542,5,B00005ALN0,"This eighth volume of season 1 is definitely a must have if you are watching this series. Every episode is important in some way. Acting as a sort of mid-point for the season in the fact that it separates two eras.

Episode 29: Sailor V Makes the Scene - 1st Appearance of Sailor V (Venus), Artemis. Zoycite masquerades as Sailor Moon around town in order to draw out the four scouts. When they fall into her trap, even Tuxedo Mask is wounded and defeated. With Zoycite and her partner, Malachite, about to win, Sailor V arrives to save the day. Her guardian cat, Artemis, reveals that the V stands for Venus. The scouts are thrilled to add Sailor Venus to the team. However, despite this joyful occassion, Queen Beryl discovers Tuxedo Mask's true identity.

Episode 30: A Crystal Clear Destiny - 1st Appearance of Mina. The scouts hold a meeting to greet Venus in their civilian identities. Mina, Venus' ID, joins the group. Meanwhile, Darien, who is still injured from the last battle, is contacted by Zoycite to meet and battle. Serena accidentally gets stuck with Darien in a tower and the two learn each other's identities. Before they can discuss their feelings, Zoycite severly wounds Darien. Serena's pain causes the rainbow crystals to reform the Silver Crystal which reveals the moon princess: Serena.

Episode 31: A Reluctant Princess - As the moon princess, Serena has no problem defeating Zoycite with the Silver Crystal. Beryl calls back her forces, leaving the 5 scouts to try and escape the tower. Luna and Artemis reveal vague memories of the scouts living on the moon centuries ago before the Negaverse attacked. The scouts and Serena are the resurrected warriors from the Moon Kingdom. Serena tries to deal with the shock of being the Moon princess. Beryl disposes of Zoycite for failing too often and Malachite is sent to face the Scouts in a fierce battle. Meanwhile, Beryl begins healing and brainwashing a captured Darien.

Episode 32: Bad Hair Day - Serena continues to deal with being the moon princess. She wonders what's happened to Darien. Mina attempt to take her out for a makeover to cheer her up. Beryl sets up a salon designed to examine hair and discover the identity of Sailor Moon. As the scouts confront the newest monster, they are shocked when Tuxedo Mask re-emerges, as the newest soldier of the Negaverse.

This tape is not to be missed. Great episodes all. Plus, many agree that the scene where Serena is revealed as the Moon Princess, comes off better in the dub than in the original Japanese (!!!). These episodes are great examples of Sailor Moon's beauty as a series. Plus, they leave you with a feeling that, as good ol' JR would say, business is fixin' to pick up.",1104192000,7,2712,4.761702127659574

7935544,5,B00005ALN0,"As a Sailor Moon fanatic, I just HAD to buy this movie. I had seen it once b4 and fell deeply in love with the Characters and songs that are in these shows. Sailor Moon and her gang, The Sailor Senshi..... have to battle against Zoicite, Malachite and the evil Queen Beryl in this movie!
I actually cried in this movie. It is just a ""heartbreaker"" movie. Good for all ages, but esspecially good for younger kids and teens!  Although, my mom cried in this movie too! So I hope to proove to you that this movie is probably contains the best 4 episodes dic ever produced! And although the dubbing isn't that good..........the movie is still always MY fave! And it can be your's too. So quickly buy this awesome tape, and see the wonderful world of Sailor Moon and her Sailor Scouts!!!!!!!!!",1019606400,2,787,4.465277777777778
7935545,5,B00005ALN0,"At last Sailor Venus makes the scene.  I own this volume of Sailor Moon and it is one of my favs!!!  It shows who is the Moon Princess at last.  I have been a Moon fan since I was 8, but the show somehow got cancled.  I had forgotten about it for awhile until I saw this movie for sale.  I bought the movie and was hooked once again on Sailor Moon.  This movie is great if you have never seen what Princess Serenity looks like.  This is the best volume of the first Sailor Moon season that I own so far.  I recomend this to all people who love Sailor Venus and Princess Serenity.  The song ""My Only Love"" plays through the transformation of Princess Serenity. I almost forgot.  DARIEN IS DEAD!!!! Or is he.  The scouts may soon learn that the Darien they once new may never come back.",1002844800,2,784,4.125827814569536
