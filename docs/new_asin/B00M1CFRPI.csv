8669644,5,B00M1CFRPI,"The movie is great in my opinion, however unlike other viewers I don't go into a movie with high expectations. Kinda like reading the description on the book. The description on the back was enough to get me interested. While it could've been better if these were more experienced actors they did an amazing job. It didn't feel predictable. I actually wanted to keep watching, and I can't say that for all movies. It's a good movie overall. I did get it for a dollar, however I'd pay easily 10 for this if not more. It delivers, I'll put it this way. Don't expect a James bond quality movie, the only real down fall of this movie I can think of is sometimes it can bounce back and forth between scenes kinda suddenly leaving you wanting more of what you were seeing. But it's a great movie. Read the description of it. If you like it. Give it a shot.",1530921600,,850,4.31875
8669645,3,B00M1CFRPI,"I really wanted to like this more. It's not as bad as a lot of the reviewers on here make it out to be. It's just a very ""eh"" film. Do I feel like I wasted my time? No, it's a movie I'll watch agin, if only for the cast, who honesty did the best with what they had.
If you're looking for an action flick that you can just turn on and watch without giving it much thought, this is the film for you.
For a heist film, I felt like not a lot really happened. We get very by the book characters. No real development happens much with them. I kept having to ask myself why they were friends. It wasn't very believable- both the friendships and they story.
This felt like it tried to be a spin off of sorts on ""Catch Me If You Can.""
I think the biggest issue honestly is in the script.
The dialogue is alright, but nothing I would write home about. As I said before, the actors did their best with what they were given. And honestly, they weren't given very much.
Sam: The leader of the group, gets into trouble when Yatsey and Rafa steal from the wrong person.
Beth: The love interest who exists purely to give Sam something to do.
Yatesy: The manipulative jerk who just seems to be a jerk for the hell of it. No real reason. Just a jerk.
Rafa: The pushover who lets Yatsey walk all over him when things go sour.
Fordy: Somebody needed to be the hacker I guess?
I wish I was exaggerating, but these could have been really wonderful characters, had they had any development whatsoever...
I'll watch it a few more times with friends. It's good for a laugh! It's not supposed to be a comedy, but sometimes its so ridiculous you just have to laugh",1524960000,,1637,4.167192429022082
8669646,4,B00M1CFRPI,I bought this movie because I wanted to see how Will Poulter was spreading his wings. He's a great up and coming actor showing wide diversity and ability. Just loved him in ( we're the millers ) but who wouldn't? He was great in his role in ( the maze runner ). Now a different role in plastic. I'd say he's well on his way!!,1434758400,2,325,4.015384615384615

8669648,1,B00M1CFRPI,"I don't know how I sat through the whole movie, it was just AWFUL, one of the worst I have every actually finished.

I wish I could get those two hours of my life back. I think Im going to send a bill to the makers to have them pay me for watching it.

The acting was horrible, the stuff they do and say is just plain STUPID, even if this was based on real life there is no way in H$^$&^ it went down anything like this.

This was by far one of the stupidest movies EVER made.",1428192000,,476,3.787878787878788

8669652,4,B00M1CFRPI,"I liked this film. The plot is very predictable but the story is based on actual events.
I agree the character development is poorly done but the insanity of the plot to raise 2 million pounds makes this movie a worthwhile experience.  I walked away feeling very entertained.",1410825600,4,275,4.729166666666667
8669653,2,B00M1CFRPI,"The film opens with ""Based on a true story."" Faced with high unemployment a group of young entrepreneurs engage in black mail and credit card fraud. When they strong arm the accountant for some organized crime figure, they are forced into a payout of 2 million pounds. They scam Frankie (Emma Rigby) into helping them, having to relocate their operation to Miami, where they go for a big scam.

The movie was in part a teen party film, and another part it was a crime drama. The blending didn't work that well. The set up was rather quick and the character building was weak. Just a hard film to get into.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex, stripper nudity.",1409356800,4,655,4.589743589743589
