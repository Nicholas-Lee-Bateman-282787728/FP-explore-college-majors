5722963,5,B00CIRH696,I really enjoyed watching this movie which had a lot to do with people who only thought about themselves. It is a good family movie without typical Hollywood language or sexual scenes. The story was very good and kept us wondering how it would end. There was a lot of forgivenss needed for a lot of people in the story. It showed what can happen when someone is dishonest.,1374883200,8,372,4.405797101449275
5722964,5,B00CIRH696,"Sandy Boikin wrote this first as a stage play, then made it a film.  It is a superb production and I predict this lady will go far.  This deserved theatrical release.  I have used it with great success in our God at the Movies Bible Study.",1474416000,,239,4.1521739130434785

5722968,4,B00CIRH696,A nice movie to watch if you are looking for something with a good moral and no nudity or violence.  For some that may mean boring but I didn't mind it nor the religious message behind it.,1472860800,,188,4.081081081081081

5722972,5,B00CIRH696,"WOW, this movie was better than I expected.  It had a good story line and a good twist.  More importantly, it's one of the few moral films I saw that didn't get too preachy.  I like it!!",1468627200,,186,3.972972972972973
5722973,4,B00CIRH696,An emotional drama about a young woman who is in a coma for 19 years and wakes up to find life has changed drastically since she last remembered.,1467072000,,145,4.214285714285714
5722974,3,B00CIRH696,"It was cute, it was campy and had some very religious overtones to it. Though not horrible by any measure. Just wasn't prepared for it.",1465862400,,135,4.44
5722975,5,B00CIRH696,"I do not give out five stars easily, or often. However, I am doing so for this movie.

To be fair, this movie started out rather questionable. A young woman, just out of High School, is in a car crash with her fianc and two other friends in the year 1989. She wakes up in 2008, almost 20 years later, and to be honest, her ""recovery"" was not the most realistic. It was passable, but from an artistic film point of view, it missed a lot. If I was to rate the film just on the first part of the movie, I would have given it fewer stars.

Nonetheless, as the movie continued, it seemed to get better, and by the end of the film, I was really glad that I had watched it. The lead character grew more likable as the story progressed, and the unexpected twist to the plot really brought things together in a great way.

All in all, if you are looking for clean entertainment, with a positive, uplifting message, and can overlook the fact that this is not an Oscar award winning film, you may really enjoy this. Especially if you have had some serious setbacks in life, and need a bit of inspiration.",1465516800,,1093,4.220095693779904

5722980,3,B00CIRH696,"Had the ability to be a pretty good film, but while the opportunity for the lead actress to accept Christ failed so did my expectations. I found myself wondering what's the point of this film anyway.",1456876800,,199,4.555555555555555

5722996,2,B00CIRH696,Based on a play and characters did not gain depth in the screen translation.  Plot is driven by characters NOT talking to each other -- somehow revealing God's plan.,1442102400,,165,4.689655172413793

5723001,5,B00CIRH696,"This is a clean family film with a positive message. That alone gets it some credit. They do the ""wake up 19 years later"" thing without being too clich. There are some ""what's a text?"" moments, but more of the focus is on relationships, broken dreams, and personal character.  There is a good message about the need to communicate, and standing by your loved ones. There are plenty of tears, and it is geared more for teens and adults, so younger kids might not get into it as much.  However, there is no bad language, violence (car crash is mainly implied), or sexuality (just simple kisses). This is a real break-out role for Mandy Brown as the woman who wakes from a coma after 19 years!",1401926400,4,690,4.468253968253968
5723002,5,B00CIRH696,"I loved Leaving Limbo because it was a romantic comedy that makes us believe in miracles. Sandy Boikian is a very talented writer and director. She has managed to tell a story that moves us, makes us laugh and uplifts us. The story was magical, the acting excellent and I was always on the edge of my seat with twists and turns I never saw coming. The casting was perfect. I fell in love with Mandy Browns portrayal of Monica as a spunky trusting teenager who has a difficult job adjusting to a world that moved on the 20 years she was in a coma. Amy Mathieson was delightful as Rosa, the nurse who took care of Monica when she was in the hospital and has a hard time letting go. Elias Cecil was handsome and endearing as Ben, Monicas high school fiance who moved on after she went into a coma, Noelle Perris was perfect as Tuesday, Monicas best friend who married Ben after the accident that left Monica in a coma and Ben unable to fulfill his athletic career.  Luke Barnett was sympathetic as the driver of the car who never forgave himself for causing the accident. David Fruetching warmed our hearts as Monicas father who never gave up on his daughter. The movie leaves us feeling good and wishing it would never end because we have fallen in love with the characters.",1388188800,5,1272,4.412765957446808

8582180,5,B00CIRH696,"The lead actress is actually really believable, and does a great job portraying a 19 ur old trapped in a 38 yr old womans body. The movie isn't as cheesy as its camera work.

Forgive me for the comparison, however, when you like certain movies and you are searching for the like; this type of review is helpful. I enjoyed the actors, dialogue and wish that it was shown on television or maybe slightly remastered for the movie theatres. One to watch if you have the time. It took me to me to my Bible and allowed me to appreciate a couple old bible stories #ChristianAuthorGoals. I will look for more from this playwright turned author!",1512345600,,546,4.581632653061225

8582187,2,B00CIRH696,Acting not the greatest. The lead gal way over acted. It was hard  to watch her. Too much over done drama.,1474588800,,106,4.0476190476190474
