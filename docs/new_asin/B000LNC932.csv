8609013,1,B000LNC932,I ordered this video as a surprise for my parents for their suprise cruise to bermuda .We all sat down to watch it and it did not work. It never did anything it stayed on the first screen . Very unhappy.,1175904000,13,203,3.975609756097561
8609014,1,B000LNC932,"Well, this was dissapointing for a few reasons. 1. The DVD format is non standard, you may want to make sure  you have either a computer with DVD or many different DVD players to try and play it on. It may or may not run on your machine. It took multiple trys but finally got it running on a Macintosh computer. 2. The presentation was much too short and not in-depth enough for our likes. The Run time on the case says 1 hour and 10 minutes long...not sure what planet these folks live on  but this was about 20 minutes at best.

Hugely dissapointing, spend your money on some other product. How come there's no 0 star rating available, this surely qualifies for this??",1174694400,17,670,4.344
