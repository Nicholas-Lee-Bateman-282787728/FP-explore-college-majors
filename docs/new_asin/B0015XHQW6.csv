3148233,5,B0015XHQW6,"I've loved D.B. Sweeney since ""The Cutting Edge"" for his totally heart-felt and down-to-earth style of acting.  What this movie does, is take that style to the next level.  The stuff we talk about with the friends we've known forever may sound pretty strange, stupid or boring to anyone else.  ""Two Tickets To Paradise"" captures so poignantly just how all of these seemingly insignificant conversations and experiences weave together for each of us, creating not simply histories that we share with each other as old friends, but the compass by which we orient ourselves. Sweeney has written the dialogue about these three old friends in an honest, funny, and at times unbearably sad tone, reminding us of how we all can and do get stuck in our lives, to one degree or another, and how, invariably, our old friends become the yardstick, and maybe the impetus for us moving ourselves a few feet forward. All three main characters, as well as the minor characters give very well-modulated performances...no over-acting, no corny monologues, and a good, but not yucky-sweet,Hollywood ending. It's almost as if Sweeney is reminding us that we can give up cinematic junk food by experiencing films that deeply move us with simple reality instead of with the fantastic and improbable. Too bad that Moira Kelly didn't have a bigger part, since she and Sweeney have such natural chemistry together. Good tunes. Hope he makes more movies like this.",1262736000,3,1439,4.9875
3148234,2,B0015XHQW6,"This movie was pretty bad.  It's about three middle-aged guys who go on a roadtrip together.  They've been friends for years.

The entire beginning where we get to know the characters was extremely bad.  No interesting features and just downright bad writing.

The film does improve a little bit when the guys eventually go on the roadtrip (which by the way, takes FOREVER to get to that point, which means lots of mediocrity until the guys get in the car together and travel).

The guys do very stupid things, like wreck their car, assume they've won the lottery when they really didn't and act like children, attempt to jump off the bridge when they get drunk and/or stoned to commit suicide, and lots of other silly things.  One of the friends even lies to the other one about sleeping with his wife just to make a man out of him, but the writing is just totally poor so it's not interesting.

Maybe other people can see the appeal in a movie like this, but the storytelling was just horrible the entire time.",1248739200,3,1012,4.521978021978022

Stuck in their boring routine and wondering if this is as good as it gets, a sudden unplanned road trip is exactly what these friends need to escape the problems of their life. Character flaws and bad habits are exposed that test the limits of dedication. I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures that these friends endured.

3148236,5,B0015XHQW6,"Who doesn't love a good comedy?

Two Tickets to Paradise is ""man humor"" at it's finest!

D.B. Sweeney has proven to be a multi-talent with the writing, directing, producing and a fine comedic performance in Two Tickets to Paradise.

2 thumbs up...just what the doctor ordered to tickle your funny bone.",1231372800,3,302,4.882352941176471
3148237,5,B0015XHQW6,"Not only is DB Sweeney a Great Actor, Great American (he sent me coffee while I was in Iraq), OK guitar player,  but he has done an awesome job directing this one.  I want to thank him for coming to Iraq to show us this movie.  I pre-ordered it from Amazon, received it on July 22nd here in Iraq and have watched it three times already. I have caught something new each time I watched it.  We were laughing through some of the parts I missed the first time, then I watched it with headphones the second time.
It has a true story line, not a Hollywood story line and great music (well except when he butchered Blue Collar Man, a Styx song).
I highly recommend this movie, it will be one I watch again and again.",1217376000,5,710,4.160583941605839

3148239,5,B0015XHQW6,"I saw ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" at a film festival in Hawaii - and I thought it was the best feature movie of the entire festival.  It's a great story about the friendship of high school superstars coping with less than spectacular middle age lives.  This movie makes you laugh so hard, you leave the theatre felling good and haunted with memories that make you smile for weeks to come.  If there is a moral to this movie, it is the value of friendship throughout life.  See it and feel good all over.",1212278400,4,501,4.354838709677419
3148240,5,B0015XHQW6,"This is a gem of a film, directed and written with heart and truth, at times it brought tears to my eyes, and in the next scene, made me laugh, as I have done much the same as the characters so deftly drawn by D.B. Sweeney. Anytime, an actor can take both sides of the camera, and craft a film so entertaining and rich, this is a film and director to be noted.
Though the film concentrates on the three buddie's embraked on a life changing road trip, it is also noteworthy for the fact, that finally a director has given the veteran actor John McGinley the starring role he has so richly deserved after many many films. John's performance is bravura, going from alpha male bravado to being absolutely cratered as he realizes what is important in life, which is this: the friends we keep are the ""family"" we lean on. That is a universal theme that bears truth. Five Stars, you won't be disappointed.",1211500800,16,898,4.4156626506024095
3148241,5,B0015XHQW6,"Saw it in New York City.

Great stuff.  Anyone who has good friends will recognize the hilarity only friends can produce.  I was laughing so hard at a few parts, I missed the next 10 seconds of action.

Also a great movie on regular guys growing up a little late.  Anyone will be able to relate.

3148242,4,B0015XHQW6,"I watched this movie in Kuwait with D. B. Sweeney.  It was a very funny and touching movie.  It hits home the feelings a lot of older men have, how things didn't work out like we thought they would when we were in High School.  Some drug use, a lot of alcohol, a real nice car and a real nice bike.  Did I mention the stripper?  Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and was glad that D.B. brought it to us in Kuwait.",1210118400,4,415,3.9518072289156625

8260237,3,B0015XHQW6,"Hmmmm? This is definitely a great guys movie on a Friday night. its up there with movies like Stripes, Caddy Shack and Animal House. My only disappointment was that I wish Moira Kelly's character would have been in the strip bar or hooters scenes. That would have been kinda cool only because the movie ""The Cutting Edge"" is one of my top 10 movies of all time. I love the chemistry between D.B. Sweeny and Moria Kelly in that movie so wanted more out of them both in this movie. But I quickly moved on to the Guy-Bonding and self-reflection parts of this movie because we all get into our 40s and 50s and just want to hang out with our old friends and remember the good times. Sorry D.B. Sweeny its a great movie but 3 stars bro. P.S. I still bought the video for those dude-bro cigar movie nights at the lounge on the big screen TV. Thanks man.",1521331200,,846,4.260869565217392
8260238,2,B0015XHQW6,"Major D.B. Sweeney and John C. McGinley fan, but this movie was terrible. They were trying so desperately to be funny but it fell completely flat. Not Sweeney's best work! 3 guys down on their luck and hating life go on a road trip - and yep, you guessed it, are dealing with more than they bargained for. Predictable!",1469232000,,318,4.406779661016949

8260240,4,B0015XHQW6,"After their team up in the 1992 sports romantic comedy The Cutting Edge,the reunion between D.B.Sweeney and Moira Kelly finally happened after 14 years in this movie entitled,""Two Tickets To Paradise"". The story revolves around three life-long friends in their 40's that are in search for themselves as they face problems of their own.

Mark has developed a serious gambling problem that is beginning to affect his marriage. McGriff cannot let go of his dream of becoming a famous rock star despite having a supportive and beautiful but unfaithful spouse. Finally,Jason refuse to mature and still lives with his parents. This made them go to a trip together and try in search for life answers that will help them find answers in life.

This film written and directed by D.B. Sweeney was basically had great moments but never got into a satisfying whole. Too bad that D.B. Sweeney's reunion with Moira Kelly did not result into a good film similar to The Cutting Edge. They barely had scenes together and Moira was barely a presence. Nevertheless,it will still manage to provide good entertainment especially to those who love coming of age films. Added to that,it will be appreciated by those who are experiencing difficulties and want to see a movie that will give them hope amidst life's difficulties.",1419120000,,1303,4.972477064220183

8260245,4,B0015XHQW6,The movie is fun about life time friends and working through issues and how everyone has there up and downs.  Nice to know your true friends will stick with ya and how sometimes its hard to listen to them! Funny scenes of how they deal with there friendships. Loved it..its keeper if you have it on DVD.,1315612800,,303,4.315789473684211
8260246,4,B0015XHQW6,"I bought this movie just to see D.B. Sweeney & Moira Kelly on the screen again. Honestly,  I'd pay to watch them make a grocery list together.  What a lovely surprise that this is a good movie too. There are some terrific lines, enough awkward, happy and sad to make it real and John C. McGinley!  After having watched this, I will watch & buy pretty much anything that Mr Sweeney is involved with because I can trust him to bring the funny, the real and the beautifully thought out.
Sit on the couch with Hubby, open a couple of beers and enjoy.",1281571200,,546,4.281553398058253
