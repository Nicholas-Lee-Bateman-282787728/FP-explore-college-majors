8318921,2,B001LNOLB4,"Both hypnotists certainly know how to do instant inductions, and you get lots of opportunity to see them do so. However, they only offer ideas about how to develop a business or show around this, they don't really show you how to do this. The production quality is low. There is little in the way of detailed breakdown.

The cover copy indicates that you will get a lot more content than you do, and the first thing they tell you is that you really need another of their products first before this one, yet this was not in the cover copy. That product description indicates that this is a complete program.

This is really a taster of what instant inductions looks like and a promo for their other training. This product was filmed at least five years ago, and their ""cutting edge"" methods are now quite commonplace.

Also, these guys never seem to fail. They don't really show you how they selected their participants. I feel that this is a DVD that is designed to make them look good, but is not really a learning tool.

I feel that this product should be priced at under $20 as the educational content is low.

There are better ways to spend money if you want to know about this",1380153600,3,1181,4.423963133640553
8318922,2,B001LNOLB4,"Another of those ""what is"" and not ""how to"" as it was advertised. Some entertaining parts. DVD spliced with several YouTube videos. Save your money. You will not learn how to do hypnosis, inpromtu or otherwise. And for the entertainment value, just watch the videos free on YouTube.",1364774400,3,282,4.895833333333333
