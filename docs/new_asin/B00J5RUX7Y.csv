6337844,5,B00J5RUX7Y,"This is one of the best kdramas I ever watched.  I have watched about 50+ of them. This drama has everything you expect and more. Great actors, storyline, special effects, the hero and the villian, love story, comedy, and more. I fell in love with the alien, but more; you fall in love with the girl. I love everything about her acting, I compared her with Gong Hyo-jin from Greatest love and Master's Sun. Great comedians both women and I love both of them. I have watched every single kdrama from Gong Hyo-jin and she is the best comedian, but after watching Jun Ji-hyun performance in kdramas, I was totally impressed.  I totally recommend it for everyone to watch it.",1400112000,4,671,4.583333333333333

8648495,4,B00J5RUX7Y,"Nice drama.  The DVDs work well.  2 pieces of feedback:  Most of the episodes do not have the epilogue, which I feel is a very important part of the drama.  The other feedback is that the last episode is stuck 2 minutes before the ending.  I had to go watch the ending on YouTube.  Overall, great drama, nice DVD set.  The English translation was pretty good.",1412121600,3,359,4.348484848484849

8648497,5,B00J5RUX7Y,"This love story between a human and an alien is heartwarming and funny!  The thing that I like about K-dramas is that they're long enough (21 one hour episodes in this case) to let the story unfold thoroughly.  We watch the main personalities change as love enters their lives, and we see the people around them change as well.  The side stories all bump into the main story regularly and waiting for the bad guy to get taken down will make you hold your breath.  There is one particular scene with a car almost going over a cliff that is so well done I had to play it several times to see if I could spot how it was done. (And no, I couldn't figure it out.  As it should be.)

The ending will leave you with the feeling that you are so very glad that you watched it!  PS - you will want fried chicken and beer.  Trust me.",1406678400,,822,4.09375

8648499,4,B00J5RUX7Y,"I was really excited and impatient for this drama to come out. As soon as I saw the promo, I was completely intrigued. Neadless to say, I watched this drama weekly instead of marathoning the whole thing once it finished airing (which is what I usually do).

I really like the idea that was used for You Who Came From The Stars even though it isn't original, this is still the first korean alien drama I've ever watched.

Do Min-Joon is an alien who's lived in our planet for over 400 years and is eagerly awaiting to go back to where he came from. Now, only 3 months are left and he has done a great job on being aloof, not getting involved with other people's lives. But when he meets Cheon Song-Yi an A-list actress, he can't help but be curious about her, as he discovers that she looks exactly like someone he's met back in the Joseon era.

Do Min-Joon has some pretty awesome abilities that I wouldn't mind having for myself. He can freeze time, move things with his will and he can also teleport to anywhere he wants within a blink of an eye (Yeah. I know. Just like Goku :P). However, he never uses these abilities to save or help people as you'd expect him to. He believes that a person's destiny is already written; if something's supposed to happen, it will. Though it's amusing to watch him use his powers whenever Cheon Song-Yi's in danger (the poor guy just can't help it).
On the other hand we have Cheon Song-Yi who's a funny and silly character. She's a top celebrity that keeps bragging about how ""everyone"" loves her when really no one does. In fact when she gets into a difficult situation only a few stayed by her side.

There are a few unrequited love going on in this drama that I didn't really like. Lee Whi-Kyung and Yoo Se-Mi's one-sided love didn't seem believable. I think that when you've loved someone for so long and that person still doesn't love you back, you just have to let him/her go. You can always find someone else to love if you truly want to.
Aside from that, I think the side characters and the villain were pretty enjoyable to watch. What I really love though, was the romance between Do Min-Joon and Cheon Song-Yi. They are so cute and good together.

Even though it lacked of originality, this drama did an amazing job on mixing lots of different aspects that I like (the ET reference, the Twilight 'he moved at lighting speed and saved my life' thing and the teleporting like Goku).

Overall this is a good and enjoyable rom-com drama.",1405555200,5,2481,4.4298245614035086
8648500,5,B00J5RUX7Y,"I can't say enough about this movie.  I never wanted it to end.  A great villain.  Complicated relationships, un requited love.  I laughed, I cried, I got mad as hell.  But I never felt indifferent.  Great movie.  I will watch it over and over.  I hope Ms. Jun gets many of these great movies to do.  As much as she desires anyway.  She is a very good actress.  All of the actors clicked in this one.

My love from a star,  My Sassy Girl,  Secret Garden, Coffee Prince. Gu family Book. to name a few.  great movie entertainment",1402358400,2,527,4.23469387755102
