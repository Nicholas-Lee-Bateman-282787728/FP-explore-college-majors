1978671,5,B00018D3YG,What a great script and a talented cast! Bill is hilarious as a beer drinking ambulance driver. Very funny performances from Larry Hagman and Allen Garfield. Harvey is great as a straight man to Bill. Then the gorgeous Raquel Welch is added to give the movie even more flavor! One of those rare comedies that is still funny even after repeat viewings. I would put this movie in the league of Blazing Saddles and Used Cars. Now why can't more movies like this come from Hollywood??,1095379200,4,480,4.593023255813954
1978672,4,B00018D3YG,"Alternately ahead of its time and an unmistakable product of its era, the 1976 paramedic comedy-drama ""Mother, Jugs and Speed"" has finally made its way to DVD.
This uneven but underappreciated little B-movie drew obvious influence from the blood-and-pranks mixture of Robert Altman's ""MASH,"" but you can also see its darkly comic influence on contemporary fare such as ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Bringing out the Dead,"" and it poked fun at zip-ups gone wrong 20 years before ""There's Something About Mary.""
Bill Cosby and Harvey Keitel play Southern California ambulance drivers forced to contend with all manner of accidents and injuries, both amusing and tragic. The all-over-the-map cast also includes Raquel Welch, Allen Garfield, Dick Butkus, Bruce Davison, L.Q. Jones, Larry Hagman (as a creepy lech whose antics haven't aged well) and even Allan Warnick, the kid from the records room in ""Chinatown.""
With its gritty, widescreen look and those awesome blue lens flares so common to the period, ""Mother"" is a fine, funky 70's curio. Welch and Keitel (who had just been replaced by Martin Sheen in ""Apocalypse Now"") are stiff but the rest of the pre-Carter administration cast seems to be having fun, particularly Cosby, as the glib, laconic Mother. It's a bit strange to see the sitcom star playing an anti-hero, but his cool, sneaky performance breezily anchors the movie.",1083456000,11,1374,5.165919282511211
1978673,5,B00018D3YG,"After all these years the Peter Yates classic staring Bill Cosby, Raquel Welch, Harvey Keitel finally arrives on DVD.  Take Cosby's humor, Raquel's sex appeal, Keitel's smouldering late 70's cool and one sweet ride of an ambulance, and you've got Mother, Jugs and Speed.  Peter Yates' classic take on the ambulance industry in metropolitan Los Angeles gives us a little bit of everything in a quick, well paced film.  Cosby's charm shines in one of his best roles i think as the cynical, no nonsense ambulance driver Mother Tucker.  Just by looking at Mother's custom Rig, and patch covered jacket you get the impression that Cosby's character was not always an ambulance driver, but perhaps was once something quite differnt.  Follow the F+B ambulance company and their staff of irregulars (Including Larry Hagman of Dallas Fame, and football player Dick Butkus) as they do their best to save the lives of their patients and hammer away at one another with a barrage of jokes, and one liners.  They don't make comedys like this anymore where the car was just as big of a star as the trio named in the title.  While normally found in the comedy section, the film does have an equal number of ""dark"" moments that let the viewer know that Yates wasn't just doing this for laffs and help to balance out the humor. The DVD transfer is crystal clear, and the slamming 70's soundtrack will be nostalgic for some, and new, and inventive to others.  Another reviewer mentioned hearing Peter Frampton's ""Show me The Way"" playing in an early scene, and I always think of this film when i hear that song.  Treat yourself to a 70's classic, and enjoy the ride, and pray that if you ever need the guys in white that he shows up wearing yellow sneakers with red socks, and goes by the name of Mother Tucker.",1079913600,31,1793,4.64873417721519

1978746,5,B00018D3YG,"70's camp. It is a good movie. About an independent ambulance company (Alan Garfield) owner, Cosby & another actor Bruce are the driver's. They are competing with the big time company that dominates LA. So they barter through cheaper prices get more business. ""Jugs"" aka Raquel Welch, also a staple of the dated time it's made mid-70's. She actually answers good- humorly to it, doesn't seem offended, nor once complains & for this era she is a nonsense, strong woman not afraid to speak her mind. That would be a sexual harassment suit stat today, however. Boy times have changed . Anyhow, it's worth a watch. Also, a pre- Dallas, Larry Hagman also stars. Is mainly set in the ""Little Italy"" of Venice Beach, California. Great scenery. Lots of laughs & action.",1492128000,,761,4.7727272727272725

1978797,5,B00018D3YG,"I was 16 years old when this flick came out.  It was funny then; it's funny today.  But one thing it did for me was steer me away from the drug scene amongst some of my peers.  Even though the movie is a comedy, its portrayal of the L.A. drug community convinced me that this was something that I didn't want any part of.  I was working as an usher at a movie theatre at the time.  I must have seen it two dozen times.  The film was held over in our theatre because it was selling out most nights.  The films production values are not the usual Hollywood standard of the day, but the script is funny and the story is fluid, hilarious and it works.

1978888,3,B00018D3YG,"A lot of fields, including law enforcement and ambulance services, have been forced to become more outwardly professional over the years. For legal and financial reasons, they just cant get away with some of the behavior they may have back in earlier days. Made and set in the mid-70s, this film is look back at those bad old days in the ambulance industry as seen through a comic/acerbic lens. M.A.S.H. on wheels is a good description for this film that follows the misadventures of one crew working for a hanging-on-the-edge ambulance company in Los Angeles as they battle a competing company, face a variety of situations, and deal with personal and professional changes.

Cosbys Mother character is a jaded ambulance driver who goes through his day with a cooler of beer at his elbow between him and his partner. Mother knows how to bribe the local sheriff in order to get work, knows his way around the law, and likes tormenting a parade of nuns who always seem to be crossing the road as he drives by.  Theres just a couple of times Cosby gets to display is full-on goofy mode in this film, and one is a scene where hes at the Institute of Sexual Awareness (a whore house) where a girl has a dildo in his ear. Hilarious, huh?

As the movie progresses, a series of things happen, some funny, some tragic, and Mother is forced to deal with new partners. Theres Speed, a police detective played by Harvey Keitel who forced to take other work while he awaits the outcome of drug allegations against him; and Jugs, the ambulance services secretary/dispatcher played by Racquel Welch, who has recently completed EMT training and is desperate to prove herself in a mans field. The film also features a post-Jeanie / pre-Dallas Larry Hagman as a scumbag  fellow ambulance driver whos not above raping an unconscious passenger.

I remember when Mother, Jugs & Speed first came out, and I hadnt seen this film in probably 20 years prior to buying it recently on DVD. Maybe Ive matured, but I found parts racist and sexist and didn't find the film generally all that funny. It has its moments, but is not a great film.  This is Cosby trying to be edgy, hip, and maybe a tad socially conscious, although this doesn't go very far; not the Cosby who brought us family man Heathcliff Huxtable.",1426723200,,2284,4.655086848635236

1978891,3,B00018D3YG,"Mother, Jugs and Speed is a movie that probably couldn't get made today (they got away with doing things like nick-naming the premier sex symbol of the day ""Jugs"", for example, something that probably would never even have been attempted in The Hangover), but it's certainly an interesting piece of 1976 zeitgeist, full of sexist jokes, bizarre corrupt behaviour, and silly car chases. It's billed as a black comedy, and it's pretty black all right, particularly one scene when a beautiful junky (Toni Basil!!) calls the ambulance hoping that they have drugs, then pulls a shotgun on them; not a lot of comedy here, though. It tries to be gritty, but is often just silly. The acting is terrible, but you do get a quirky line-up of misfits, including the quietly intense Harvey Keitel, an unhinged Bill Cosby, and a stunning Raquel Welch (her first scene is eye-popping). Larry Hagman pops up as sexed-up goofball, who gets involved in an pretty ugly rape scene. M*A*S*H this ain't!!",1424649600,,982,4.88622754491018

1979070,3,B00018D3YG,"Mother, Jugs, and Speed (Peter Yates, 1976)

The rest of Peter Yates' body of work is eclipsed by a single scene: the famous car chase in his 1968 film Bullitt that has been endlessly copied and is considered by many critics to be the best ever filmed. That scene eclipses the rest of the film's mediocrity, but Yates' other flicks don't have that scene, and have been generally recognized as the mediocre flicks that they are. Be that as it may, a Peter Yates film has a kind of cheesy magic all its own, even when it fails as spectacularly as does Mother, Jugs, and Speed, a film in which Yates picked up one of the best casts to appear on the big screen in a single movie that decade, and that's saying something.

The scene: Los Angeles, California, in the mid-seventies. LA has just privatized its ambulance service, and two upstart companies are competing for the same turf while the city decides which of the two is going to get the contract for the territory. One of those is the F&B Ambulance Service, run by greedy and corrupt Harry Fishbine (Until the End of the World's Allen Garfield). Fishbine's best driver is Mother (Bill Cosby), who's far too good for this place, but is something of a boozer behind the wheel and refuses to conform to the standards more above-board companies would impose upon him. His chief rival in the company is Murdoch (Dallas patriarch Larry Hagman), who's just as greedy and corrupt as Fishbine, but without the same social niceties. Jugs (Raquel Welch) is the company secretary with a secret, and Speed (Harvey Keitel) is the new guy, a cop on leave while he's being investigated for selling cocaine to schoolkids. No, this is not your mother's ambulance service. Things get going when Murdoch's partner Walker (Poltergeist's Michael McManus) gets bitten by a rat on a call and gets laid up just as Speed is trying to get a job to tide him over until the investigation is done. Thus begins the game of musical drivers. Meanwhile, Mother has perfected the art of snatching calls out from under the nose of Unity, the other ambulance company competing for the territory. Tom Mankiewicz' script builds plot twist after plot twist to a conclusion that is inevitable, and yet still surprising.

I don't want it to sound like I think Mother, Jugs, and Speed is a bad movie. In fact, of the Yates movies I've seen, this is probably my favorite. That may actually be because it's such a spectacular failure, and yet is still something of a success. As a comedy, it's horrendous. Bill Cosby couldn't seem more out of place than he does here, and even his best comedy bits fall flat here. And while Paul Schrader managed to get Harvey Keitel to be funny in Blue Collar, but that was a mean-spirited black comedy, while this is meant to be slapstick. To be fair to Keitel, who's a phenomenal actor, he's not the problem here. He does the best he can with the role he's given, but I'm not sure I've ever seen a piece of miscasting like this. Not only a comedian, but a romantic lead? Even Abel Ferrara couldn't pull that off. It's not romantic, it's not funny, it's as miscast as a movie can be. How can I call it a success on any level? Because while the substance is all but useless, you can almost taste the potential in this plot, especially when it comes to its climax. I get the feeling that a lot of pieces of this movie having to do with the actual plot got left on the cutting room floor, and had they been left in, this might have been a brilliant movie. Every time the movie focuses on its plot, such as the rivalry between Mother and Unity driver Albert (the great character actor Arnold Williams), it hits on all cylinders. When we get to the climax, a court scene where the city makes the decision on the contract, we actually care. The movie drops off a cliff after that, but when it works, it works.

It's an artifact of the seventies that, for many reasons, must be seen to be believed. You probably won't like it once you're finished, but while you're watching, you will not be able to look away. ** ",1248739200,,4049,4.503401360544218

1979099,1,B00018D3YG,"I had never seen this movie before when I came across it in our local thrift store. After checking out the blurb on the back cover (""hilarious!"") and seeing the cast (I've always liked Bill Cosby), I bought it with the expectation that it would be a good, entertaining comedy. Not so.

For me, this film was very offensive with near-constant foul language, violence, and two main characters hopping in the sack about 5 minutes after meeting. Some of the scenes I found particularly upsetting were the point-blank shooting of a man, a woman dying after giving birth (it happens, but it still upset me), and Larry Hagman's character molesting an unconscious woman in the back of his rig (this was the lowest point of the film, in my opinion). Unlike some other reviewers, I would not qualify any of those things as ""amazingly funny"" or ""hilarious"" or even mildly amusing.

Apparently, a lot of EMTs love this film, as it tends to reflect their own experiences. I can understand that, but for those of us who are not EMTs and who are looking for a mindless, enjoyable comedy, this movie is not something I would recommend. It left me feeling sick to my stomach. Even without the offensive parts, I thought the whole story really fell apart towards the end.

The cast list alone is so ridiculous, it could answer a trivia question. Harvey Keitel? Right there, you have to be interested. Larry Hagman? Yes, he's in it too, and this was post-""I Dream of Jeanie"" and pre- Dallas. Rumor is his disquieting portrayal helped him get the J.R. Ewing role (take that, brother Bobby!). Bruce Davidson, before he became a stereotyped nice guy, was a stereotyped younger guy, but he does quite well playing off Bill Cosby. Yes, Cosby and Keitel. It would seem to be a disaster, but it works. You want more? Raquel Welch - in her prime (and I do mean prime). Her acting isn't bad either, and she manages to also do well against two engaging actors (Cos, Harv). Every single cast member down to the tiniest role is great in this, and the unpredictably funny, odd, and serious, even a little heart-hitting moments, come like waves crashing into an ambulance on a beach. The music is fantastic, the cars and trucks are super-70's, but they still hold up if you love Americana, and the one-liners and sight gags are just fantastic. If you like some of the Farrely Brothers earlier stuff (not their last two dry, blah films), see this film. If you like Quentin Tarantino, see this film. If you like to see nuns freaking-out when the sirens go off out of nowhere, see this film. If you want to just sit and watch people having fun, find out what people eat at odd times on odd shifts (hint, don't be eating anything when Cosby orders his food from  his ""rig"") yet also acting and interacting, and take yourself somewhere while you actually forget you're watching a film, and, instead, think you're really along for the ride in that ambulance company, SEE THIS FILM!

One more point and it's a great trivia question. Try and find out why the owner of F&B says he named his company in the way that he did. It's not what you think, and it's really a slogan for the entire attitude of the film. Cosby should've screened this before and after every other film he attempted, because he nailed a film role - finally. The answer is below, so don't look unless you feel compelled to read it by my engaging review and question.

ANSWER:

They ask the owner, Fishbine, what the ""B"" stands for - is it a partner, does it stand for something? He says, no, the ""F"" is me, but I wasn't about to name my business the ""F"" Ambulence company.  HAHA hilarious.",1133049600,,2508,4.501098901098901
1979129,5,B00018D3YG,"I saw this movie while working for a private ambulance company in Los Angeles. Four of us got off work one morning and went to see the movie. Right from the beginning, we were laughing so hard that we could barely keep our seats. It was way too real! There is a ton of ""inside"" humor in this movie that makes it all the better to watch. Years later, I was working as a fire-service Paramedic and I would loan out my VHS tape copy of it to trainees and tell them it was a 'training film' they could watch at home. I always loved seeing their jaws drop when I told them later that everything in the movie was based on truth. As far as I am concerned it had great writing, great direction and great acting. One of my fire service coworkers actually drove the Cadillac ambulance for his company after the movie makers returned it. He said they left the paint job the same even though they weren't the 'company colors'. The part played by Raquel Welch really was true to life as when I worked on the private ambulance company, they hired their first female attendant to work the ambulance regularly. When I got on the FD, my entry class had the first three women on the department. Younger people have no idea how set the 'man's world' attitude was in those days.

Aside from Bill Cosby, Raquel Welch, and Harvey Keitel the cast includes Allen Garfield, Larry Hagman, Bruce Davison, and Dick Butkus.  The film is consistently engaging and funny.  That said the comic elements do do not always mix well with the tragic ones.  The film also pushes the envelope as to what you can do in a ""PG"" film.  A couple of scenes come to mind where one of the EMTs tries to take advantage of an OD case and another where Cosby is receiving a massage with vibrators.  Cosby is fine as the wisecracking Mother, Welch's range does not extend much beyond one of her pin-up posters as Jugs, and Keitel isn't really given much to do as Speed.  Standing out in the cast are Hagman as the libidinous Murdoch and Garfield as the owner of the third-rate ambulance company.

Wonder wore in 1973...I am a huge fan and notice that. I also notice how funny Cosby delivers his lines...""Turn the Machine off!' or please, not in mixed company...its hilarious!!  I also love when he falls over the tires trying to be slick! A Great film with moments that must be seen!

Enjoy!",1104883200,3,606,4.4324324324324325

8008147,3,B00018D3YG,"This film is a 1976 American black comedy film directed by Peter Yates. The film stars Bill Cosby (Mother), Raquel Welch (Jugs), Harvey Keitel (Speed), and Larry Hagman as employees of an independent ambulance service trying to survive in Los Angeles.  This film is not a comedy all the way through, it also has serious and sad points.  Sadly, I have heard from a gentleman I knew who worked in this industry in the 1980's that it was pretty accurate of what it was like working in this industry in the USA.  This film is from the 1970's so don't expect it to be politically correct and there is a molestation scene that my disturb some, so be warned.",1517702400,,651,4.453781512605042

8008151,5,B00018D3YG,"Four acting legends starting out in the early 70's if you include Larry Hagman. Slapstick humor, insults for everyone, and classic 70's vibe. Opening music track not to bad either. Even though it's pre ""WKRP"" it catches that same craziness of a small time business just trying to get by. Very non - Politically Correct. Sexism, Chauvinism, Drugs, etc. This movie could not be made today using the same script. PC is ruining comedy.",1513900800,,431,4.837837837837838
