8276813,2,B001AD6UKU,"This version by Sinister Cinema is not of a very good quality. The picture is difficult to see, the audio difficult to hear. The synopsis of the movie that I read piqued my interest, but the synopsis is much better than this predictable and slow-moving movie.",1465516800,,259,4.6521739130434785
8276814,1,B001AD6UKU,"This was advertised as  Alfred Hitchcocks 1972 movie,instead got a1930s version. I,m not interested in this version. I've had nothing but trouble  downloading movies from Amazon since I started doing it yesterday.",1358899200,,213,5.625
8276815,3,B001AD6UKU,"Number one: this movie should not be confused with Alfred Hitchcock's '70s thriller, Frenzy.  This Frenzy is more of psychological drama than it is a horror flick, despite its advertising promo.  There are no frenzied, crazy killers running amok through Paris' Latin Quarter.  Instead, the movie focuses on a tormented artist played by former Hitchcock actor, Derrick De Marney.  He is haunted by his predecessor, another sculptor; as well as what happened to the sculptor's former girlfriend, played by veteran British actress,Joan Greenwood.  Derrick had developed a relationship with Joan, and had planned to run off with her.  One night, as he waits for her, Joan never shows and his sculptor friend gives him an unsatisfactory story that she simply upped and left.  Now, a series of eerie events plague Derrick in the dark, gloomy loft he took over from his predecessor, and they effect his new girlfriend as well.  That's until Derrick finally gets to the bottom of whatever happened to Joan.  If you're a horror buff like me, you'll figure out the ending before Derrick does.",1265500800,5,1082,5.033707865168539
8276816,3,B001AD6UKU,"This movie called Frenzy is also known under the title Latin Quarter. This is about a mad sculptor who marries a ballerina - who discovers that he is mad and wants out. She has an affair - and her lover wants to her to leave with him to parts unknown. They decide to make a rendezvous in the evening - she wants to leave now, but he says wait until tonight. Bad idea. The big mistake is he lets her go back home to pack her things. She never shows up for the rendezvous and her lover is out to find out what happened to her. The mad husband is arrested for murder but the woman murdered is NOT his wife, so where is she anyway ? hmmm
Part of the story is told in flashback as the lover explains this to a doctor..and then goes into the present where the lovers' studio is haunted and decide to have a seance.
What happens next is really chilling (at least to me) and it is worth watching as it will hold your interest for the entire 70 minutes. It might be tame by today's standards, but it is a creepy little flick that I feel deserves more recognition and better treatment if a company chooses to release this movie commercially. The story was solid, the acting was fine and was fun to watch. The transfer from Sinister Cinema wasn't bad at all, pretty much what one would expect from them. The black and white transfer was clean and sharp despite no digital remastering. I am glad Amazon carries their titles as they are 10.00 less than what Sinister charges on their own site..
That being said - I would encourage any DVD company (Criterion, Anchor Bay, Kino, Image ) to take a look at this title - I think it deserves to be on commercial DVD from one of these companies. Not Alpha, thank you..
The movie kind of reminded me of the original Dead of Night and has the same actor - the doctor - playing a doctor again :) !
It is a classic - a blend of horror/noir/drama - worth seeing if you are into classic British films",1252454400,6,1924,4.202702702702703
