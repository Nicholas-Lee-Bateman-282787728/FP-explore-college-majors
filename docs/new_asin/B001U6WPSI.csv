8343105,5,B001U6WPSI,This is a great and challenging cardio workout.  It combines cardio from a variety of Firm Classics.  You can purchase this same DVD at Collage Video for $14.00.,1427241600,,161,4.714285714285714
8343106,5,B001U6WPSI,I was happily surprised with this workout.  It had gotten good reviews- but I was still skeptical that a full step workout could give me the same cardio workout as my other FIRM cardio DVDs.  It is a slow build- with the pace getting faster as the workout goes on-  but the steady pace does deliver a solid cardio workout.  It is a compilation of other step routines from other FIRM workouts- but for someone who gets bored easily (like me) it was good to have the variety of styles and instructors.  This will definitely hold a spot in my rotations.,1377907200,4,550,4.405940594059406
8343107,5,B001U6WPSI,"I've enjoyed step aerobics since the late 80s-early 90s and this is a great workout!  I purchased it recently and I'm so glad I did.  Beware that it is a compilation of segments of a few older FIRM workouts and you will definitely see dated outfits and hairdos.  If you can get past that ~ and really, it's a minor detail, so it's easy to get past ~ this workout will have you sweating and burning lots of calories and THAT is what's important.  You'll work hard, but it's fun and there is lots of variety.  I'm happy to add this workout into my rotation.",1366761600,6,555,4.247619047619048
8343108,5,B001U6WPSI,This is a great cardio workout! It's taken from several older Firm workouts. It's an oldie but a goodie.  You won't be sorry with this one.,1364688000,,139,4.346153846153846
8343109,5,B001U6WPSI,"I love that this Firm workout is entirely step (except for the warm up). You can do the entire workout, or choose by chapter.",1362614400,,125,4.25
8343110,5,B001U6WPSI,"I totally love this workout, It's a classic which are by far the best Firm workouts ever.  I had it on vhs until it just broke,  I was so excited to hear that it is now coming out on DVD finally, An awesome workout on DVD!!! It will be out soon @ Fitness Favorites.com  Anna Benson's website creator of the Firm workouts.",1349395200,,321,4.145161290322581
8343111,5,B001U6WPSI,"I'm so happy I got my hands on this workout! I am a big fan of the older FIRM workouts and I've always enjoyed the ""step"" segments because the music is good, and it is choreographed very well to the music. It makes the workout fun and it goes by really fast. If you enjoy the older workouts and want a good cardio sweat, this is a great addition to your collection.",1344902400,5,365,4.083333333333333
8343112,5,B001U6WPSI,Love this video.  It is all cardio and all step aerobics.  Super fun segments by different instructors make the time go by quickly.  It is a thorough workout at about 1 hour.  This video is very rare and it took me a long time to find it but it was worth it.  It is different for The Firm because it is all step.  Usually Firm tapes mix up floor and step segments.  But I love this because I think the step makes it more fun.  It starts out with slower/easier segments but then it really ramps up the intensity.  By the end you have gotten a great work out.,1251676800,6,557,4.036697247706422
