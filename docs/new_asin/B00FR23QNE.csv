6022285,5,B00FR23QNE,Didn't get into this show until it was already in Season 3.  I spent my maternity leave watching the box set.  I'm now an avid fan and can't wait for each new series.  I buy on iTunes as well as the box set - that should say it all.,1384300800,4,232,3.693877551020408

I didn't get into the show until last December when I came accross it accidently on TNT.Have seen all the episodes so far several times,bought all 5 sets and just ordered 6.",1382918400,6,348,4.915254237288136
6022289,4,B00FR23QNE,"This is a show I like but after season 3 it has been a disappointing combination of what seems like filler episodes, with a couple of shining moments scattered here and there. It is the appreciation I have for the cast that keeps me watching and perhaps hope that some of the old magic from the first three seasons will be recaptured. Largely, this season felt like a lot of missed opportunities.

The season finale disappointed not because I wanted a clique conclusion, but because the entire episode had Beckett fight to earn a happy ending only to lose out in the end. It felt like a poke in the eye -- just my opinion although fan dissension may have played a part in the recent removal of the original showrunner.

Normally I buy the DVD sets for this show, but a heretofore unavailable extended bedroom scene from the season 4 Always episode between the two leads was presented by the former showrunner at an October 2013 Texas film festival. This is a scene not included in the season 4 DVD set bonus features. This development has made me wonder if a number of other previously unseen scenes and extra features may be bundled into a large complete series DVD package once the show is off the air. So, rather than risk buying the same basic thing twice, I think I'll wait to see what is made available then.

*Update June 2014: Now we know generally what will be on the season six DVD set which I've detailed below. A mysterious season 4 to date un-aired scene is scheduled to be included and hopefully it is the one mentioned in the above paragraph. Perhaps the fans were heard.

*Update August 2014: A show producer has confirmed that the deleted scene from season 4 included in this DVD set will be ""the scene"" from Always that the fans demanded to see once it was shown by the former showrunner and his wife at a writer's conference.

*Update September 1, 2014: The ""scene"" from the season 4 Always episode is now readily available to view by simply typing Castle Always Deleted Scene into an internet browser. It was exactly as described by the person who saw it during the writer's workshop.

*The Season 6 Blooper reel is now also posted. Normally this is something I look forward to but the season 6 group is the worst so far -- unfunny and weird. Time is generously allotted to everyone in the cast, with one exception. Katic is largely absent -- something markedly different than in past years. If the reel was filled with hilarious snippets I would assume Katic's bits were cut for quality purposes but there is shockingly little amusing in the entire reel.

Since the episodes are readily available for viewing in a number of places (syndication, Amazon, etc.) the main reason to purchase the DVD set is usually the bonus features. If history repeats itself, these features are usually posted by ABC on you tube a month or so prior to the availability of DVD set - perhaps to generate buzz -- but if in doubt, first watch them there.

The bonus features for Season six will be spread out on all five of the discs. Disc one will include commentary by Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever in character as Detective Javier Esposito and Kevin Ryan for the Need to Know episode. There will also be deleted scenes on the disc.

Disc two will include audio commentary for The Good, the Bad and the Baby episode from John Terlesky (director,) writer Terri Edda Miller, Nathan Fillion and Seamus Dever.

Disc three will include audio commentary for the Deep Cover episode with writer Terrence Paul Winter, Nathan Fillion, Susan Sullivan and James Brolin. There will also be deleted scenes on the disc.

Disc four will include audio commentary for In The Belly of The Beast episode with former showrunner Andrew Marlowe, writer David Amann and director Rob Bowman. The disc also includes deleted scenes and a longer performance of Seamus Dever singing ""What I Like About You"" from The Way of the Ninja episode.

Disc five will include a feature a day in the life of Stana Katic on the Castle set with some attention paid to the final episode of the season. The entire cast reveals things they like about the show intersecting with fans responses from social media. The former showrunner and his wife discuss things they like about the show. There are bloopers and deleted scenes.

Also, disc 5 will include an un-aired season four scene from the finale that was not shown. It is conjectured that this is the missing scene mentioned above that caused dischord among some fans after it was shown to a small group during a Texas workshop hosted by the former showrunner and his wife. It is odd to release a season four scene on the season six DVD release, so hopefully it is that significant scene. We'll see.",1382745600,40,4707,4.616028708133971

6022360,4,B00FR23QNE,"Castle is a show about a mystery book writer Richard Castle, played by Nathan Fillion, and a NYPD detective Kate Beckett, played by Stana Katic. Castle decides to team up with the New York Police Department after a case with a killer copying murders from Castles books. The NYPD would get an extra person and Castle would get inspiration for his books. Throughout the series Castle and Beckett become very close and you see their personalities come out. The director, Rob Bowman, also did work on many other shows including The X-files, Star Trek: Next Generation, and 21 Jump Street (tv show, not movie).

Castle is similar to Bones, they both have male and female main characters who solve crime together, and the two characters end up together, and have almost completely opposite personalities. In the beginning both of the women find the man somewhat annoying and not their type. Castle is silly and jumps to crazy solutions, while Beckett is more serious and always believes there is a logical explanation to everything.

I enjoyed Castle, first off because I really like crime shows, but also because there are many different main topics or problems in seasons. For example in one season, Beckett tries to find her moms killer. She finally opens up to Castle and shows all of her work she had done on her moms case after the police department closed it with no answers. She shares that this is what made her want to become a cop. She wanted to find answers for the families of victims, something she felt the detective working her mothers case failed to do. After a while Beckett finds her moms killer. She needs to find very convincing evidence because the he is a very important politician. There are some thing that I don't like about Castle, sometimes they try to make a suspenseful season finale, like when they show Ricks car up in flames on his wedding day, leading us to believe he might be dead. But when you think about it, they more than likely won't kill off a main character, especially when the show is named after him.",1476748800,,2040,4.67966573816156

Watch him in Firefly if you haven't already. Beckett is thrown into the same emotional roller coaster every other episode. Not to mention that while she is gorgeous, the model/cop thing is over the top now. Too tan and fake looking for someone who supposedly throws their all into the job. They should have kept Alexis' original sweetness. Instead they made her rebellious. It's not working. Looks like Martha is the only one whose character hasn't gotten totally massacred by bad writing. She's pleasantly constant. I love Ryan, Espo, Laney and Gates (except for the ""sir"" thing- nobody better ever call me that!!). They need to leave Esposito's hair alone, like it was in the beginning. Same with Castle. They managed to get Laney and Espo's romance right. Don't now why they didn't with Caskett. I didn't even want them to get married by the time they did. No fire there any more. Played out way too long. I'm thinking about foregoing even watching season 8 and just re-watching seasons 1-4 again! That's where the laughs are.",1460160000,2,1181,4.851485148514851

I was worried that when the relationship was consummated that the story would die like in Lois and Clark, but it hasn't. In fact, some of my favorite episodes were from this season, though none can top the hundredth episode...Castle's birthday. For those who have seen the earlier seasons, this is a great continuation of the story. If you have never partaken, give season one a try. By the way, for those of you with teenagers, who wouldn't want a daughter, or son for that matter, like Alexis? Of course, my daughter wishes her father was like Castle!",1439856000,,708,4.5390625

6022602,5,B00FR23QNE,"There seems to be this superstition about a show going downhill when you get the main characters together, and many shows fight against it for far longer than they should.  But ultimately, it is all about how you handle the characters as a couple, and the sixth season of Castle proves just how great it can be.

The season picks up at the season five cliffhanger.  Author Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion), unaware that Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) has decided to take a job with the FBI in DC, proposed to her.  In typical Castle fashion, the response was equally parts funny and touching.  The result is that we get a season of Castle and Beckett planning a wedding.  (Really, did you expect her to say no?  The whole premise of this show is about their relationship.)  However, Beckett also takes the job with the FBI, and we spend a few episodes with that before things get back to normal.

Normal, of course, being Castle following Beckett around helping her solve murders in New York City and getting ideas for his Nikki Heat books.  Over the course of the season, they solve such mysteries as a former TV star, a case the FBI is interested in.  Theres a case where their prime suspect claims to be from the future.  Someone is killing the doppelgangers of the members of the precinct.  Theres a murder at Castles high school (well, one of his high schools).  And Who do they believe when multiple people confess to a murder knowing details only the killer would know.

Nathan Fillion decided as the season began that he wanted to work fewer hours, a move I can understand since being the lead in a show and pretty much in every scene can make for a very exhausting schedule.  As a result, Detectives Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas) and Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) get more screen time, even getting some sub-plots in various episodes while they took more of an active role in solving the cases.  Honestly, I appreciated seeing more of them and watching how their characters developed.  They are actually featured in one of the best episodes of the season, which finds them trapped in a burning building as Ryans wife (played by Seamuss real life wife Juliana Dever) goes into labor.  This didn't hold true for Captain Gates (Penny Johnson), who was still around in her usual number of episodes this season.  She doesnt seem to get quite the same amount of development she did last season, but when they give her moments to shine, she really does.  Medical examiner Lanie (Tamala Jones) is still around like shes always been and provides some great moments as well.

Unfortunately, Fillions reduced schedule meant a bit less screen time for Castles mother Martha (Susan Sullivan) and daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn).  Alexis in particular was missing in much of the second half of the season.  Im wondering if, like her character, Molly Quinn is in college.

The episodes themselves continue to entertain.  The mysteries are rather formulaic but decent, and really they are just an excuse to visit the characters each week.  We get the usual assortment of quips and one liners as the characters solve the mystery of the week; that humor is one reason I have always enjoyed this show.  There are the darker episodes, most noticeably surrounding one particular ongoing story, but they always surround them with some of the lighter episodes of the year.

But as I hinted at earlier, Castle and Becketts relationship is still at the heart of the show.  However, now that they are engaged, the writers have given the characters more depth than ever before.  It is truly remarkable watching them interact with each other in their private moments.  Castle is showing remarkable maturity when the situation calls for it, and Beckett is showing a vulnerability I never would have expected from her.  In fact, some of these scenes are my favorites from the season and one in particular could land in the top 5 overall for me.  (That first kiss between them as a couple will always be number one.)

This added depth is no problem for the actors at all.  By this point, they know the characters and are able to put everything they have into the performances.  Everyone in the main cast is top notch again this year.

Not to say that this season doesnt have some issues.  Many (probably most) fans hated Pi, the new boyfriend that comes home with Alexis from her trip over the summer.  His fruitarian ways are designed to annoy Castle.  Frankly, I found him a fun foil for Castle, but many fans hated his guts, wanting to see him become the victim of a killer in an episode.  As you are watching, just keep in mind that he is only a guest star, not a new main character.

Then theres the season finale.  It sets up a problem that is supposed to be fun but seems out of character for Beckett.  When that is resolved, we then get a cliffhanger.  Again, Im not as annoyed as some fans are (I was actually kind of expecting it).  However, if they don't resolve it correctly come the season seven premier, I will be revising my opinion of the show runners.

On the other hand, a long running story was successfully wrapped up this season.  Im glad to see them know when they had dragged it out long enough.  I was thrilled with how they resolved it and think they made the right call.

There were 23 total episodes in season 6, and all of them are collected in this set in their native wide screen and full surround.  Extras include commentaries on four of the episodes, including one from the point of view of the characters Ryan and Esposito.  There are also deleted scenes, bloopers, a day in the life featurette, and one where cast and crew talk about their favorite parts of the show, which includes a never before seen scene from season 4.

While there are some flaws for some fans, I found season six of Castle to still be very entertaining.  Even if you don't like the elements I named, they are easy enough to skip over so you can still enjoy the new highs and lows for the characters in this set.  After six years, the show is still fun and entertaining, and I cant wait to see what happens next.",1434758400,,6095,4.5874190564292325

6022675,5,B00FR23QNE,"I started watching this series because I loved Nathan Fillion in the ""Firefly"" series.  I was not disappointed. His immature, wealthy, writer character, with the very active imagination is balanced perfectly by the no nonsense, ""If I can't see it or touch it, it isn't real"", Becket character.  It was inevitable that these two would be attracted to each other.  He learns to respect her instincts and knowledge about murder, and she learns that oftentimes, Castle's weird, off beat, many times outrageous theories are not so farfetched after all.  The support actors are all interesting and believable as well. This series does a good job presenting characters you care about, and giving them interesting situations to deal with.",1429660800,4,730,5.161016949152542

I would have seen it already but her mother has forbidden us from watching it together. She is concerned about some of the sensual overtones in the series. She says we can watch it when we're married and sensual overtones won't cause our desire for each other to take over, or rather if they do, we'll be okay.
It's a network tv show so I'm not really sure that it's going to be a problem.

6022799,4,B00FR23QNE,"This season was so very nearly 5 star. The old sense of comraderie was back between the characters. The pleasing refusal of the series to take itself too seriously also returned. Every episode left us saying ""yes! The producers finally get it! They have gone back to the formula that ensnared us in the first place!"" Season 5 had some good episodes but seemed to drag itself along. This season flew until it crash-landed in the last five minutes of the final episode. The final episode was almost too comic, as the betrothed couple seek to disentangle Becket from a loveable cad. Then there is a total and unconvincing reversal, in which the producers attempt to insert pathos and tears. It is a pitiful attempt to inject drama in a series which is essentially comic and falls absolutely flat. If we wanted pathos we would have chosen Downton Abbey.",1420329600,,849,4.704697986577181

6022806,5,B00FR23QNE,The ending of Season 6 was unfortunate to say the least. Many fans really got ticked off and I couldn't blame them for their feeling of sort of being betrayed with the wedding not taking place. Even though they did exchange the vows in Season 7 it still left a hole that needs to be filled. Somewhere they need to have a full blown wedding ( to exchange their vows ) with all their friends in attendance so the fan base will fill that void that was there. The cast and Beckett and Castle haven't missed a beat as far as the chemistry is concerned and in fact I think its gotten better over the course of 6+ Seasons and I hope they can continue for a few more seasons. Nathan and Stana are huge TV stars thanks to Castle so I would make every effort to keep them in the fold and even let them have some input in directing some future episodes. That seems like it would be the next progression for these two mega stars.,1420070400,,917,4.157303370786517

6022832,3,B00FR23QNE,"I won't go into episodes individually. I think that defeats the purpose of taking the season as a whole.
Castle is falling into the same traps that the majority of prime time shows do. They have some major event, but become scared that the audience won't cope, so they resolve it in a few episodes. Sure, it crops up later, like the 3X killer or Kate's mother's murder. The resolve of the Beckett at the FBI  story line was a waste of quality guest stars. Hopefully, they will return in the future.
The episodes are good stories, but I miss the humor. The last 2 seasons have become much more serious. Sure, Castle is still a big kid, but the jokes are fewer and farther between and even those, a third fall flat.
Still a good show, just not the best season.
Oh, and to be a hypocrite about my first 2 sentences, Episode 5 almost caused me to decide that the writers gave up and are trolling the fan base and episode 23 is the most cliche pre-wedding story line on TV.",1418688000,,968,4.2896174863387975

6022880,5,B00FR23QNE,"As I may have mentioned previously, I don't often enjoy murder mysteries, because somebody died horribly, and then everyone walks around like it's no big deal - some kind of intellectual exercise whose primary function is to make the protagonist detectives look smart. Somehow, because it's a comedy-drama, Castle manages to take that convention and turn it on its ear. The autopsies are interesting without going into stomach-turning territory. Any concerns about a Moonlighting curse are swiftly dispatched as the chemistry continues to grow between the main characters. And there are some extremely harrowing moments played with courage and depth. With deft performances by Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, and a crack team of supporting players, this show is almost always a pleasure to watch.

There are some good extras on the DVD including the obligatory gag reel, which in this case should come with a coffee-and-cats warning. (Set your coffee down and get the cat out of your lap before you watch it, because I won't be responsible for your agony if you don't)

6022887,5,B00FR23QNE,"Its fans have kept 'Castle' one of the most-watched television shows in the United States.
In addition, they have kicked off a whole cottage industry: There are now graphic novels, for example, written by fictional author Richard Castle and they are hot properties.
The attraction many fans feel for this series stems from the fact that it has a fine ensemble cast headed by Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic; that it is a believable romance as well as a police drama and that its writers deftly mix a quirky brand of humor into their stories.
Season Six carries on that tradition in excellent fashion despite the fact that some of the narratives are a little thin on details.
At the start of the season, for example, Kate Beckett (Katic) has left the NYPD and now works as a federal agent in Washington. A few episodes later she is back at the NYPD. We know why, of course, but we don't know how she was reinstated as a detective. A couple of minutes of dialogue would have helped make that transition smoother.
The narratives are interesting enough, however, that the lack of some small details such as that one can be forgiven.
The episodes in Season Six range from the downright scary to humorous. They also give us some long-awaited backstory about some of the characters and give Katic a chance to show that Beckett can be something more than a by-the-book cop. In one scene, for example, she is a woman who is deeply in love with Castle while in another she demonstrates an almost feral ferocity when she is facing what might be her death at the hands of a couple of hired thugs.
The Season Six episodes also herald what will likely be some new story lines that develop in Season Seven. I say this because some old story lines - such as the one involving the murder of Beckett's mother - which have been fixtures in the first five seasons finally get wrapped up. Added to that is the fact Alexis, Castle's precocious daughter, is now demonstrating a degree of independence that she had not previously shown; Castle's mysterious father shows up again in a memorable episode that might - at long last - provide some closure for his mother; and Det. Kevin Ryan and his wife have a new baby.
All in all, Season Six is a smash and I, for one, can hardly wait until I can get Season Seven.",1417219200,,2287,4.513253012048192
6022888,3,B00FR23QNE,"This was the most uneven season of Castle ever.  Some shows were very good, but some were very bad.  It's not clear, at least to me, if Castle can keep going after Castle and Becket actually tie the knot.  The only show that's been able to do that, at least to my knowledge, is Bones.  I do like the characters (humanizing Captain Gates was a smart move), and some 6th season episodes were, as noted, very good.  So I'll watch the 7th season and hope for the best.  I also think virtually any TV show has, for lack of a better term, a natural life, and the key for a series, if it wants to be truly memorable and go out with its head high, is to recognize when it's reaching that natural end.",1417219200,,692,4.126865671641791

6022952,5,B00FR23QNE,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from the prior seasons, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 6. If you have not seen the prior seasons proceed with caution.

Castle, much like Bones is a show that found its formula, and pretty well sticks to it. It has a mystery/case of the week format much of the time, but intertwines various ongoing story arcs, and sprinkles in 1 or two goofy episodes. If you like what they have done in the prior seasons, chances are you are going to like this one too. But if you have started to grow tired of the show, then this season may feel pretty repetitive to you.

The major story arc that was finally wrapped up this year is the murder of Beckett's mother. Of course last season we learned who was actually behind it. This season we finally saw him arrested. Unfortunately Jack Coleman only appeared in a couple episodes, and the story line leading to the arrest of his character I think would have been better played out over like a 4 or 5 episode arc. But he played a great bad guy, and it was nice to see the final resolution.

The big goof episode was a 1970s themed one (complete with costumes) that played on finding a Jimmy Hoffa like dead guy and a witness who believed it was still the mid 1970s. There was also an episode totally spoofing The Terminator, guest starring the great Joshua Gomez of Chuck fame.

Much of the season continued the relationship between Castle and Beckett. Similar to last season the writers did not try to throw a bunch of roadblocks in the relationship (at least until the very end of the season) and did not have them teetering on the edge of breaking up. Yet they still managed to keep the show entertaining, whether they were going for dramatic moments, comedic moments or both. There is some character development that happens (like Alexis moving in with a boyfriend which strains her relationship with her dad, and Penny Johnson Gerald's character becoming more likeable and part of the team). As in past years the season ended with cliffhanger, this one being one of the bigger ones.

For those who get the actual DVDs, as far as extras go there are commentary tracks on select episodes, deleted scenes on almost every disc, and then a few behind the scenes features on the last disc, along with a blooper reel. The highlight of the extras is a 26 minute ""favorite moments"" feature where the cast and crew talk about their (and fan selected) favorite moments from throughout the series. All totaled there is probably slightly under an hour's worth of extras.",1415836800,,2553,4.589912280701754

6023081,5,B00FR23QNE,"Love love love this show.  Season Six does not disappoint in its extra features and behind the scenes info.  If you've not watched this show from Season One, you're missing out on a special, one-of-a kind tv show. It has everything: drama, humor, wit, charm, romance and family dynamics. I didn't stumble on this show until it was in it's fourth season, and was immediately hooked. Over that summer, I purchased the previous three seasons DVDs in order to catch up - what a treat!!! My husband is now hooked as well. While you don't have to watch the episodes in order, it helps to do so in order to see how masterfully the writers develop the characters and storyline.  I've watched many of the episodes several times, and see something new with each viewing. The writers are EXCELLENT. The on screen chemistry of the two main characters, Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic, is absolutely electrifying. The performances they bring to the show each week, and especially in many of the more drama centered shows, are of award winning quality. Just outstanding. Ms. Katic can express more emotion in one look than many actresses can in an entire script. She is THAT good. Mr. Fillion is charming beyond words. They are a treat together. The cast surrounding them are are gems. One aspect of the show that we especially appreciate, since it is a police procedural, is that it is not graphic the way so many police/crime shows are. You aren't going to see very much blood, graphic autopsy scenes or gratuitous sex.  Mr. Fillion's character has one of the best on screen father/daughter and son/mother relationships I've ever seen on tv. I believe if you give this show an honest try, from the beginning, you'll be hooked as well.  Enjoy!",1413936000,,1729,4.730897009966777

6023161,4,B00FR23QNE,Season 6 of Castle was not as engaging as past seasons.  It might just be me but I like the straight mystery solving unfettered by too much back story.  The episode with Joshua Gomez as a possible time traveler was a stand-out and reiterates the strength of  this crime show in its exploration and explanations of the strange and macabre. The loved up union between Castle and Beckett distracts from the intensity and professionalism of Beckett and the egotistical and humour of Castle.  I am hoping the couple becomes fractured again and we see more of their original 'pizazz'.  All up it is still a great show and worth the eyes and ears time.,1413244800,,645,4.62280701754386

This is a great series.  I'm sure anyone who watches the program totally enjoys the interaction of the cast members.  The story lines are great and holds our attention.  The usual twists and turns and then some unexpected ones to keep this a great series!

If there is no damage to the DVDs, I'm in the greatest shape!  That's the only question mark I have in this review...the quality of the discs.

6023253,5,B00FR23QNE,"Castle: Season 6 had me worried at the beginning, but you have to love the show. A self-professed ""ruggedly handsome"" writer who shadow's a no-nonsense intelligent, and good looking, lady detective is a recipe for good comedy/drama. It reminds me of the ""Thin Man"" - the playful but effective guy with the classy smart woman in his life. The perfect pairing.
Season 6 started unfortunately with both a proposal, which worked for the ""Thin Man"" pair, but has gone so wrong with so many current pairings, TMI usually at fault. Anyway, at the same time, the season sent Beckett the lady detective to a new job in D.C., leaving our charming writer to tag along. The fact the woman from ""House"", whom I disliked is in most of two episodes made me fear for the future of the series. But soon, the pair were returned to NY, the gorgeous loft Castle calls home, and the the squad room where they interact with Dets. Ryan and Esposito. You can go home again. As the season progresses, the  engaged pair's wedding draws near. Along the way Castle has lovely moments with is daughter Molly Quinn, wonderful in the part, and his mother, spunky Susan Sullivan. Then the wedding day comes, and the season ends in a firey crash. leaving Beckett waiting for the groom to arrive - cliff hanger. This series is a joy to watch.
If you like film noire, my favorite episode is in Season Four. The ""Blue Butterfly"" is a gorgeous episode with 40s clothing, music and Castle really pulling out the stops as the old style detective. Even Molly Quinn steps up and plays a villan, delivering some believable dialogue with a southern accent. Beckett is gorgeous in gowns that are perfect for her. Even, medical examiner Lanie, steps up and sings and old Helen O'Conner standard, ""Comes Love"". This cast is amazing no matter what the script, which are always well written. You never get tired of this pairing of leads either. One can only hope they do not ever make the mistake ""Hunter"" made, chaning leads.

6023312,3,B00FR23QNE,"I was a HUGE Castle fan and I so looked forward to receiving season 6.  Much to my dismay, it is the worst season.  About 40% of the episodes were just plain stupid.  Other than Bracken finally met his undoing (maybe), and a few other episodes, most made the Keystone Cops look good.  It took 6 years to get Castle and Beckett to the alter, then they screw that up.  Just ONE time, they (the writers) could have had one episode that ended without, what appears to be another protracted conspiracy.  The Bracken mess got so boring after 6 years, you would think they would wait till after the wedding to start a new conspiracy.

As much as I love  this series, I guess, unlike other reviewers, I cannot pander to just anything because it IS Castle.  Castle was one of the best series to come along in at least 25 years.  However,  after watching Alien Alexis and her spoiled snot behavior, then whiny Jennie and her over bearing personality,  the season's final episode was truly a big disappointment.  Part of the problem with Hollywood writers is, they think always having some major catastrophe keeps people hooked.  While I think all the actors are well chosen to play the individual characters, the scripts are getting worse.  The crappola surrounding the wedding....like Beckett being married thing, the ruined wedding dress, the venue cancellation, the car crash, etc. was too much.  At least in my opinion.  It really ruined the the sixth season.  Not sure if I will get interested in the seventh season.  There is always ""Justified"" and ""Body of Proof"".",1411516800,,1561,4.714814814814815

And there are some good laughs throughout the season as well.  Great writing.  This DVD DOES have English Subtitles for the hearing impaired and there are some extras.  Looking forward to season 7 - as usual, they left us with a cliffhanger, just when we thought Castle & Beckett were finally going to get married.",1411257600,2,448,4.493827160493828

6023328,5,B00FR23QNE,"When season 5 ended with Beckett becoming a Fed, I wasn't sure where things were headed, which, was, of course, the goal of the writers, producers and directors.  When I read about the three episode story arc proposed for the introduction of season 6 I was skeptical. However, it tuned out to be a great arc and ended as it should with Kate being fired from the Feds for doing the right thing. The rest of season 6 was entertaining.  The next to the last episode when Beckett took down the evil senator was the best episode in the season and maybe one of the best ever. That said, the final episode was very perplexing.  Although I wasn't outraged as many fans seem to have been, I will admit to some ire, but it didn't last long.  After some time to think about it, I decided to trust that the production staff knows what they are doing.  They always do.  I guess we will know in a couple of weeks.

6023361,4,B00FR23QNE,"Castle Season 6 had the highest viewership of any season to date.  It includes two of the best episodes of the entire franchise in ""The Belly of the Beast"" and ""Veritas"".  Honorable mentions to ""Number One Fan"", ""Deep Cover"", ""Under Fire"" and ""Disciple"".  It was extremely disappointing that such a great season ended with a finale (For Better or Worse) that was probably the worst episode of the entire franchise...and the sole reason I rated the season 4 stars instead of 5.  The finale was an anti-climactic plethora of cliches and gaping plot holes that all circled around the assassination of Beckett's character and mythology.  Not at all what fans have come to expect from such a quality show.  But don't let this one episode spoil your viewing of an otherwise superb season.",1409270400,4,782,4.842105263157895

6023363,4,B00FR23QNE,"I absolutely love this show and I would have given Season 6 a full five stars if it weren't for that atrocious and ridiculous season ending ""cliff-hanger"".  I don't know what Marlowe was thinking when he wrote this absurd story but it totally ruined what was an amazing season up to then.  And I believe a lot of fans and others felt that way since Marlowe is no longer the ""show-runner"" for Castle.  But other than that this was a great season with two magnificent episodes:  ""Time Will Tell"" and ""Veritas"" .  Can't wait to get the DVDs and looking forward to the seventh season with hopefully no crazy cliffhangers leading into Season 8.",1408320000,12,639,4.5701754385964914
6023364,5,B00FR23QNE,"I waited all summer (very anxiously) to see what would happen after Castle proposed to Beckett; I wasn't disappointed.  Some
really great episodes in this season and anyone who was a Castle fan but did not watch this series 6  missed some really good
ones.  The finally was an aggravating yet very interesting hanger; Now I have to fuss all summer to see how Castle, who was
certainly kidnapped by the Mob, gets out this one.  Hopefully they will get on with the marriage who everyone I know is anxious to
see; I wonder, though, if they are going to live with Martha.  I hope not; I cannot stand that Moocher even though she is Castles
mother.  Besides it is not a good idea for newlyweds to live with inlaws, though Alexi is fine.  Thank god she got rid of Cow Pi: what
an obnoxious creepo!!  She would later admit Castle was right in dissing him.  Cow Pi reminds me of Dr Sweets..Ick!!
  Why I wonder  Beckett took a job in the Attorney Generals office, especially with Eric Holder as AG.  Good Grief, she might as well
worked for the Mafia.  Anyhow, had it been the FBI, that would have been fine.  But now she is back with the NYPD; not a bad
police force to work for;  I live in NY and think they do a fine job.  I had worked for the city, but in Transit. Throughout the season
there is the typical Castle humor and good police stories; I just wonder, however, when they get hitched will we lose the little
sniping between them which led to laughs.  Anyhow, I ordered the DVD for this season from Amazon, but am keeping the
episodes in my Video Library until it comes.  Five stars I give; Becketts beautiful eyes deserve that alone!!  Enjoy",1405036800,,1645,4.348684210526316

It was nice seeing C&B on the same page, relationship-wise, for the entire season.  Problems and issues got resolved, for the most part within an episode.  Castle showed the seriousness of his commitment thru-out, as did Beckett.  Can't wait for the DVDs (to hear the couple of commentaries) and Season 7.",1400025600,5,458,4.8076923076923075

6023428,5,B00FR23QNE,"Yes, Season Six is still showing on your favorite ABC Network, and the overall rating is still 5 Stars!  Great writing, wonderful chemistry with ALL the main characters, and a surprise guest star or two from time to time make it one of the best things on TV.  Richard Castle (actually Richard Alexander Rogers) is still in the process of making Det. Kate Beckett the third Mrs. Castle, and it is, at last, no secret.
The plots are realistic.  A lot of what is shown could be on the front page any day of the week.  The handling of the cases goes by Police proceedure, at least most of the time.  Allowances are made for Castle's ability to think ""outside the box"", which, for a murder mystery writer is what got this whole thing started.  And Det. Beckett seems to be on the same wavelength - most of the time.  A lot of what makes this show work so well is the wit.  A handful of dry humor goes a long way.  There is also plenty of pun-ishment!  For  homicide Detectives there is plenty of danger, so it is not by accident that they get in some serious positions, not conducive to good health.  Richard Castle gets a lot of his ""grounding"" through a very caring, loyal and wonderful family.  Susan Sullivan is just wonderful as Marsha Rogers, his mom.  The heartbreaking beauty of Alexis Castle, his only offspring so far, is very teenager-angst ridden, but very smart; and so well done by Molly Quinn.  Castle is also reminded of the past by two ex-wives, one of whom is his publlsher, no less!  Early on we see Castle give up the supposed job of creating three James Bond novels to remain at the 12th percinct to further pursue Kate Beckett.  After 5 full Seasons and a lot of #6, there could be just too much to go over, so this is a sort of synopsis of the series.  I was working hours that didn't allow me to see the original shows first-hand, so it was through time-shifting, huiu and finally re-runs on TNT that allowed me to get hooked on this show.  I remembered Nathan Fillion from ""firefly"" and ""Serenity"", and so at least he was a known quantity.  But Stana Katic was a very pleasant surprise!  She alludes to a certain sexuality, but also a street-wise earthiness that is just the right balance for an NYPD Officer.  She guards many secrets, which baffles and confounds Castle at the outset, but a lot of it is realized in the first 3 seasons and at a breakneck pace!  This show doesn't stop for much of a break, ever; but it also flows so well that even in quieter times it holds your interest.  Above the danger of the chase, there is always a home for Castle to return to, and if quirky Mom doesn't have a problem then it is Alexis going-off-to-college-or-not that will keep him on his toes.  If I had to make an analogy of this to other shows of the genre, I would say it is like ""Moonlighting"" on Steroids!  The writing never falters, and that is one BIG reason that this show keeps coming on!
The loss of Steven J. Cannell so early on was certainlyh a blow to creator Andrew W. Marlowe, who had these wonderful weekly poker games with Castle and an actual James Patterson and Michael Connelly sitting in.  The ultimate writer's block-breakers!  (I would urge you to get the Season One DVD package for its wonderful look into the life of Steven J. Cannell, who bought so many years of unrivaled entertainment to your TV screen!)  None of the seasons should be missed, as there is something in there for just about anyone.
Also, for you Mums and Dads, there is not the gruesome exposure to death's aftermath that so many (CSI, NCIS) others show.  So the Double-Digit kids in the family can enjoy this along with you!  I will offer up no spoilers -- but I will say this: the end of Season #4 and the beginning of Season #5 are not to be missed!  I think that if this wonderful comedy/drama goes on for at least two or three more years, I would not be surprised.  And I will have enjoyed many years of a great show!  You will to, if you get busy -- and ready for Season #6's release in the Spring of 2014 ...",1388102400,105,4024,4.349865951742627
6023429,4,B00FR23QNE,"Loved the first three seasons of Castle, even though the casual sex and general amorality have always bothered me a bit. The cast, though, is fun and they work together well, so I overlooked what I didn't like and have enjoyed the show. I have seen a couple of the current season's episodes On Demand. I'm disappointed that Alexis moved in with her boyfriend, and in the couple of episodes I've seen she's not as likeable as in the earlier seasons, but I'll stick with it for one more season to see what happens. The storylines are still interesting and the interaction between Beckett, Castle, and the rest of the cast is still fun to watch, so I think it'll be worth the price to preorder this one. I hope I'm not disappointed.",1386633600,4,729,4.488721804511278
