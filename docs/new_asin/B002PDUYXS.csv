3964480,5,B002PDUYXS,The biography of Rosalind Russell is excellent!!!  It really revealed what a down to earth woman she was.  I visited the cemetary where she is buried and there is a huge cross marking her resting place.  It reminded me that she was bigger than life just like the cross.,1287273600,5,269,4.448979591836735
3964481,5,B002PDUYXS,"I have just had the pleasure of watching ""Life is a Banquet""; and a pleasure it truly was.

I know that many people were involved in the development and production of this wonderful program, and their heart and soul is inexorably woven through it.  The talent, patience, creative energy
and dedication to excellence brought to this project resulted in a visually stunning and emotionally inspiring piece of art.  Rosalind Russell's story is a wonderful example of ""can do"" smoothly combined with ""I care"".  She teaches us all how we can dine enthusiastically at the banquet of life, and share the bounty with others lovingly.  I recommend this video to everyone without hesitation.  Invite the wonderful Rosaland Russell to your life's banquet table through this video.",1264032000,16,769,5.112
3964482,5,B002PDUYXS,"This was an excellent DVD.  As a long time fan of Rosalind Russell, this product was great.  Anyone who is a fan of Rosalind Russel will love this.",1260662400,10,147,4.214285714285714
3964483,5,B002PDUYXS,"I studied Rosalind Russell and her signature movie ""His Girl Friday"" when I was a film student 17 years ago.  However, I did not know a story about her life until now.  Given the time period she lived, it is quite inspiring to know that she played roles of professional women while being a caring mother in her real life.  As a working mother, this is something which relates to me most.  I was also impressed how strong she was when fighting with breast cancer and arthritis when cure for these diseases was not quite there.  The biography covers her personal life very well.  Kathleen Turner's narration sounds like a perfect fit.  Two thumbs up.",1253491200,15,648,4.582608695652174
3964484,5,B002PDUYXS,"There never was and never will be again a Roz Russell. Kathleen Turner comes close and is also the voice in the story.

A well done and crispy chat about a woman who should never be forgotten for many other reasons aside from her comedy.
A must see for Movie Fans.",1436227200,,264,4.176470588235294
3964485,5,B002PDUYXS,Very well done! What a classy and generous woman.,1432166400,,49,4.555555555555555
3964486,4,B002PDUYXS,"Nice Bio about Russell.  Frank and clear.  Nice graphics.  Great life.  Somehow, seemed like it could have had a little more depth...but I can't put my finger on it.  It kept my interest, but didn't rivet me as would a bio about one of my heroes.  Still, was a great learn.  All the narrators had their own thing going on....meaning, very interesting and pertinent.",1427328000,,365,4.609375
3964487,5,B002PDUYXS,Enjoyed thoroughly,1425945600,,18,8.5
3964488,4,B002PDUYXS,Tastefully done life and career of the late great Roz Russell.,1423440000,,62,4.7272727272727275
3964489,5,B002PDUYXS,"I was and still am a strong fan of Ms. Russell.  I had the good fortune to work with her favorite Hair Dresser.  She came to SF to have him do her hair... he had a shop in the Mark Hopkins.  She passed before I could, through him, let her know of how much I admired her.  This presentation of her life is thoroughly enjoyable.  Kathleen Turner thank you!  You were a real choice for this... no one else could touch her as you did.",1420416000,,430,4.0
3964490,5,B002PDUYXS,Very good video. Well worth watching and thinking about.,1419465600,,56,5.333333333333333
3964491,5,B002PDUYXS,What an actress and what a class act. Long live Auntie Mame.,1417651200,,60,4.083333333333333
3964492,5,B002PDUYXS,"Loved it, and I'm not a documentary guy.  Thought it was very interesting and very well produced.",1413936000,,97,4.705882352941177
3964493,3,B002PDUYXS,"I love Rosalind Russell, her energy, soul, wit and compassion, not to mention her inward and outward beauty. But every time Kathleen Turner's raspy, grating voiceover distracted me, I found it jarring and intrusive. I imagine a velvet voice narration by the likes of a Peter Graves type was no longer available. Too bad A&E Biography never did an in-depth study of Ms. Russell. Obviously, she deserved it. Her close friends (Cary Grant etc.) are no longer around to be interviewed either. I wish Sandra Bullock had narrated it, as she has a similar style of warmth and class.",1408233600,3,575,4.818181818181818
3964494,5,B002PDUYXS,I thought it was very informative and confirmed what a nice person I thought she was. I do think though it is interesting that from reading a book about the life of Loretta Young about how close she and Loretta were supposed to be that Loretta Young was never even mentioned in this story.,1407715200,,289,4.37037037037037
3964495,5,B002PDUYXS,I learned a lot about Rosalind Russell that I did not know previously. I was a good story.,1407024000,,90,4.055555555555555
3964496,4,B002PDUYXS,"I enjoy Rosiland in just about everything she is in, so I enjoyed hearing her back story. Would watch this again.",1405987200,,113,4.428571428571429
3964497,5,B002PDUYXS,"Not the best documentary ever, but the addition of her voice narrating was a nice touch. She was a classy, intelligent, savvy and beautiful woman; the documentary honored that well.",1391990400,,181,5.066666666666666
3964498,4,B002PDUYXS,"I would like to see more even her life made into a film.  This fine documentary reflects the life of a hard-working woman who was ahead of her times.  She asserted the rights of women unannounced and with such class from the snappy Hildy in ""His Girl Friday"" to the woman past her prime and desperate for love in ""Picnic."" and on and on; because her  real life was a struggle against almost impossible odds in a Hollywood where men moguls ruled the day.  She finished up strong in her struggles with serious illnesses  (before better treatments) yet left us all too soon.",1387411200,4,571,4.504854368932039
3964499,5,B002PDUYXS,"Absolutely an amazing life story of an amazing woman!  Her talent was clear in everything she ever starred in.  When she did comedy, it was absolutely priceless especially when she co-starred with William Powell in Rendezvous!  Truly an outstanding actress who I will miss.",1384992000,3,273,5.159090909090909
3964500,2,B002PDUYXS,"As the film went along, I kept wondering what it was in her background/upbringing that made her charitable and a humanitarian and able to live a courageous life in spite of major physical trouble.  This question wasn't answered.  I searched online and found that she was Catholic.  On the Rheumatoid Arthritis Warrior site:  it says that ""in her last two years of total, private agony, she lived by this poem-prayer that she wrote: Trust Him, when darkest thoughts assail thee, Trust Him when thy faith is small. Trust Him, when to simply trust Him is the hardest thing of all.""  The dvd is an entertaining overview of her film carrier, but it would have given a more complete picture if it covered, or at least mentioned, some of her upbringing.  The question was a growing distraction for me, as I kept expecting an answer.",1384819200,5,825,4.694444444444445
3964501,4,B002PDUYXS,A really wonderful story of this amazing woman's life - informed by early theater experience she went on to co-star with some of the biggest names in Hollywood and reinvented herself throughout her life. A must-see for any Rosalind Russell fan.,1372809600,,244,4.975609756097561
3964502,1,B002PDUYXS,"I thought it was a book, but it's a DVD. It went back as soon as I received it. Sorry.",1369872000,,86,3.35
3964503,5,B002PDUYXS,"Being a Roz fan since I was 16 years old back in 2001, I have waited for this day to come. I completely adore this Bio of Rosalind Russell. There is tons of old Home movie footage as well as some great Interviews from people that knew her best. This Validates my idea of her persona, that in real life she has as much, and if not more.. more Charm, Grace and beauty then in any book I have read about her.",1306800000,6,405,3.951219512195122
8376922,5,B002PDUYXS,I loved the biography of the film star Rosiland Russel. I now know more about her life than just seeing Auntie Mame or the Woman. Her life and journey was funny and tragic. She was a great wife and mother. Wish all talented movie stars could be as classy,1482278400,,254,4.204081632653061
8376923,5,B002PDUYXS,"Rosalind Russell was my hero after starring in Auntie Mame. I didn't know much else about her; what a fantastic woman. Definitely worth viewing, especially at the price.",1478476800,,169,5.071428571428571

8376926,4,B002PDUYXS,"Great if you're a newbie RR fan! If you're a lifelong devotee, you've probably seen most of these photos and clips, and know most of the narrative. It's a delightful and gracious reminder of a marvelous talent and selfless citizen.",1464652800,,231,4.8

8376931,5,B002PDUYXS,"I never knew all the things Ros Russell did besides act. I enjoyed her movies, but after watching this, I respect her as a person. I read her autobiography years ago, but it didn't include everything in this documentary. She was a strong woman who took on life's challenges with a quiet strength.",1439251200,,296,4.60377358490566
