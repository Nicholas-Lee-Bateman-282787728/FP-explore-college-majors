8020540,1,B00022AAZQ,This video was a REAL dissapointment. The entire movie looks like a vacation video of someone who had to much rum. What a waste of money.,1169424000,,137,4.3076923076923075
8020541,5,B00022AAZQ,"I have watched entralled at this 60 minutes DVD and it is unbelievable how exciting it is. Guyana Eco tours or rather ecotourism in Guyana makes island sand and beach pale in comparison. Ecotourism in Guyana is very exciting. As a result of this DVD I took three of my friends to Guyana. One Australian, one German and the other, a Scandinavian female. My friends were so excited, they gushed praises upon the breathtaking beauty of Guyana. I must say this DVD, which we took along as a reminder of the places on it that we wanted to experience, was very acurate describing these places as 'Spectacular Wonders of Nature', as indeed they were! This is truly a remarkable production. I rate this DVD five stars! (I wish they had ten stars to rate this DVD. I would use it all up) A Tropical Adventure, Guyana Ecotours, a must-have on either DVD or VHS!----This review is excerpted from Caribbean Diary Magazine and written by Nadia De Frietas, it's Assistant Editor",1116115200,4,964,4.676470588235294

I often recall the lengths I had to go through explaning to friend in Europe and others parts of the world about my country some people thought it was Ghana in West Africa, I would say no Guyana South America the only english speaking country. A Tropical Adventure truly is explicit and parents should allow there children to sit and look at this lovely breath taking DVD. I also recommend it to environmentalist, and if you are from Guyana and has never really visited the riverin areas here is your opportunity to travel the beautiful country of Guyana a land of one people one nation and one destiny.",1083974400,4,699,4.691056910569106
