5968893,3,B00F6Y3FLG,"I remember watching this in the summer time laying on my Grandmothers living room
floor. I know their where other actors that played Tarzan long before Ron Ely but he
was the Tarzan of my generation. I didn't remember much about the series except the
opening credits, where he gives the yell and jumps off the water fall. Now that Ive
watched some of the episodes, theirs nothing real good about any of the plots or
themes. Most of the Hollywood A list stars make at lest one guest appearance, that
is A list for that time period. Although their are a few black actors in these shows
most of the people in the village scenes are not African at all, the look more like
Indian or maybe South Pacific in origin. I guess Hollywood did not have enough
black extras to make the series authentic. Also the elephants are Indian not African.
The small ears are a dead give away. I grew up watching TV so I have a special
place in my heart for 1960s TV series. If you are of this generation or a Ron Ely fan
you should add this to your collection, but if you are looking for a real good 1960s
TV series watch a couple of episodes on you tube and pass this up. The plot on
these shows are so bland and predictable I doubt I watch more than a few episodes.",1390521600,3,1244,4.1875

5968895,5,B00F6Y3FLG,I watched Tarzan TV 1966 when I was a kid. I was searching for the full 2 seasons' episodes either in VHS or DVD format for the last 20 years (believe it or not). Finally and thanks that it is at last released. I am too excited to have this in my collection.,1388534400,2,258,3.8867924528301887

5968900,3,B00F6Y3FLG,Not as good as season one but if you like tarzan and Ron Ely you will probably be ok with it. They changed the movie theme music which I feel was a mistake.,1485216000,,156,3.757575757575758
5968901,3,B00F6Y3FLG,I am a big Tarzan fan and Ron Ely certainly looks the part and is articulate in the original Burroughs mode. I only wish that was also the case with the story line.,1484870400,,164,4.0

5968904,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"I really enjoyed the CD.  I remember this show as a child long ago. It's nice to watch something without all of the profanity.  And it was so long ago, it was like watching for the first time. Morals and values, what a combination.",1480982400,,231,4.2272727272727275

5968906,4,B00F6Y3FLG,"A slice of my childhood. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Tarzan and how cheesy it was. Ron Ely always made the show better but there is only so much one person can do to make a show such as this what one would call good. However, Ron Ely in his little loincloth made Tarzan a must see.",1470182400,2,288,3.8983050847457625

5968910,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"Amazing to see this show in pristine colors and clarity after watching it thru UHF snow channels as a youth.  The second season is amazing in of itself for its exceptional supporting cast appearances, including Julie Harris, James Earl Jones, Geoffrey Holder, Diana Ross and the Supremes (!) and the incomparable Ethel Merman, to name but a few.  Well written and directed.  5 stars.",1443830400,3,383,4.953125

5968913,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"I purchased this for my nephew, who grew up watching Ron Ely as Tarzan, and who has frequently mentioned the show. I bought this as a gift for him, and believe me he feels it's a 5-star event for him.",1435708800,8,200,4.025

The quality is excellent and we are happy to have this lasting memory of his experience with the making of this episode .",1432425600,8,316,4.096774193548387
5968916,5,B00F6Y3FLG,fantastic series. Ron Ely was the best of all Tarzans.  Some Tarzan's in movies are fat and out of shape.  Ron Ely was super big in several episodes. You could believe he was a super strong Tarzan,1431907200,3,196,4.27027027027027
5968917,5,B00F6Y3FLG,Great quality. I can still hear Tarzan's yell from my childhood. I recommend to fans of the show.,1428883200,2,97,4.444444444444445
5968918,5,B00F6Y3FLG,This was my favorite TV show of Ron Ely.,1428278400,,40,3.5555555555555554
5968919,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"Great to see these old time classic TV shows available. The story lines are interesting, great viewing, well scripted and very nostalgic. When you watch such classic television series and compare it to what is out there today, you ask yourself the question ""where did we go wrong?"" I am sick of watching trash that brain washes our children into being dysfunctional. Anyway, enjoy Tarzan.",1427673600,6,388,4.984615384615385

5968921,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"I used to love this show when I was a kid.  To me, it's MY generation's version of Tarzan.  I still enjoy the series now.  This show is pretty rare and hard to find.  Never seemed to run in syndication very often, but a great classic show worth checking out.  I recommend you pick up both the first and second seasons of the show in order to have the complete series.  If you enjoy Tarzan and jungle themed entertainment.",1423612800,3,421,4.265822784810126

5968923,5,B00F6Y3FLG,Reminds me of my childhood. I hardly couldn't wait to see it on tv every Saturday evening. Ron Ely was my absolute favoured Tarzan and kind of my idol to look up to.,1418169600,,165,4.03030303030303

5968926,5,B00F6Y3FLG,I enjoyed this program as a teenager and could not wait to get the series. I like Ron Ely as an actor and felt he did Tarzan justice. Anyone who enjoys a good adventure or to rekindle childhood memories would love this.,1401926400,2,219,4.238095238095238

5968928,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"It's a reasonable series, with Ron Ely making a very handsome and affective Tarzan.
'The Blue Stone of Heaven' (PARTS 1 and 2) are my favourites.
Even though this series has taken too long to have a DVD release, it's finally out and I'm very pleased to have it as part of my growing collection of Tv shows and Films.",1392508800,3,316,4.283333333333333
5968929,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"I grow up in the late 50's and 60's and really loved to watch Tarzan movies, but when Ron Ely came to play the role of Tarzan in the 60's I fell in love all over again when he played Tarzan. Bring on all the seasons he played if you haven't already.",1390694400,,249,3.8076923076923075

8612798,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"I really love this series, Ron Ely portrayed Tarzan according to the novel, Tarzan was indeed a smart person who not only spoke English but French also. Every episode was done as though it was a movie by itself. Too bad they did not continue beyond season Two. The DVD I received was also in very good quality and I enjoyed every moment of it. I recommend it to anyone who is a Tarzan fan and to anyone who has not view any Tarzan movies, pick this DVD and you will become one.",1513468800,,477,4.139784946236559
8612799,4,B00F6Y3FLG,"I grew up loving this Tarzan. Same cheesy formula week after week, but that was part of its charm. This was not your standard Tarzan: he was more educated and civilized than most of the earlier portrayals. The individual DVDs are not well-programmed, but considering finding another source proved just about impossible, this proved to be the best way to relive my youth and one of my favorite guilty pleasures.",1512518400,,410,4.871428571428571
8612800,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"An excellent TV series from the 60s, very original with dynamic and exciting adventure scenes. His arguments carry a certain message and content of values and sometimes of naivety, I like the cinematographic techniques used at that time, there is no constant abrupt camera movement used nowadays.",1509321600,,296,5.319148936170213
8612801,5,B00F6Y3FLG,"I have been watching these episodes on Prime but as we all know, nothing stays on Prime forever. If you love this show, get it on DVD while it's available. I have watched all 75 episodes (seasons 1-3) and have had no issues with the quality of the discs. They arrived in durable cases, 3 discs in each case with no loose discs or breakage. See my short review in Prime video. I think the video quality is much better on the DVD's, although the case label doesn't really give much information. It doesn't even specify the region. Let me assure you that mine came in region 1format.",1499904000,,580,4.37962962962963

8612803,5,B00F6Y3FLG,This is a fun watch. If you even remotely like the Tasrzan concept you'll like this series. I bought it because I remember watching it as a small child so I thought I'd check it out and see if it was as good as I remembered. There's a lot to recommend it. Ron Ely is a great Tarzan. Closer to the Burroughs original concept of an intelligent cultured man who reverts to the jungle life rather than he's an idiot raised by monkeys in the jungle approach. So if you like an intelligent Tarzan Ron's your man. The show does a fine job considering it was only a half hour show allowing little time to really go in depth with any story since in those days you had to wrap it up and return things to status quo by the end of each half hour adventure. So don't expect huge things from the plots in terms of emotional complexity but that's not really what Tarzan is about. Tarzan in my opinion is more about athleticism and this Tarzan has it. Lots of action and wrestling of lions and whatnot. So in the end I wasn't really disappointed in viewing it again after all these years. In fact I have great fondness for the show now. So in the final analysis I would highly recommend this show.,1492992000,3,1181,4.230088495575221
