1480652,5,B00005JKQ7,"What a great movie.  It is a classic.  It is just a funny, weird, rock and roll movie.  No real substance except for funny scenes and great music.  Fear's cover of ""Hootchie Cootchie Man"" alone is worth the price of this on DVD.  Once you see it, you will be hooked.  It is almost like a cartoon. I couldn't recommend it highly enough for almost anyone (except kids).  A good look at early 80's wacky filmmaking.",1073520000,11,412,4.342105263157895
1480653,5,B00005JKQ7,"An incredibly funny movie that hits all the right chords, with a killer soundtrack and great parts for Howard Kaylan (Flo and Eddie, The Turtles), Bobby Sherman and Fabian!!
I want this on DVD!!",1020470400,7,194,4.735294117647059
1480654,5,B00005JKQ7,"This is, quite simply, a movie that i do not believe could be made today.
The drug jokes, the non-PC scene at the blind blues man's funeral, the general laid-back, loosey-goosey anything-goes scattershot approach to movie making are simply too much of the 80s -- and the early 80s at that.
It's coming up on New Year's, 1983, punk has pretty well given way to New Wave, but the music is still interesting, and promoter Max Wolf (read: Bill Graham, and you wouldn't be far out, portrayed perfectly by Alan Garfield) is planning another gala concert to celebrate the New Year and the fifteenth anniversary of the Saturn Theatre music hall (read: Fillmore East, where Arkush was an usher -- he can be seen onscreen in a hitchcockian cameo wearing his Fillmore East usher's t-shirt) at the same time.  It'll be the summit of his career as a promoter.
Colin Beverley (Ed Begley Jr), CEO of Serpent Records, aided by his yes men (whose names are too good to reveal), who was fired after three days as a Saturn usher, years ago, wants to buy up the aturn's lease, tear it down and build an 88-story HQ building for Serpent on the spot.  Beverley will use any method he can, including terrorism, to get that lease.  he offers Max the chance to put on huge shows at his stadium venue.
""I put on concerts where the kids can see the band and hear the music.  So screw stadiums, and screw you."" Max answers. (Long Live Rock'n'Roll!!! i say.)
Believing he is dieing of a heart attack, fearing what evil Beverley may be planning, Max decides this will be the greates concert of his life -- and he calls in his markers.
They'll all be there -- Nada (with special guest, Piggie) (Lori Eastside and Lee Ving)!  King Blues! (Bill Handerson) Captain Cloud and the Rainbow telegraph! (Howard Kaylan, of the Turtles, hilarious as a time-warped hippie)  Reggie Wanker and his band (and his girlfriend, Countess Chantamina) (Malcolm MacDowell out jaggering Mick and out kinking Ray)... and Auden, existential folk-rock poet, the man who made the Sixties what they are today! (Lou Reed in a deadly deadpan Dylan-in-black-leather portrayal).
And the whole thing rests squarely on the shoulders of Neal, the stage manager (Daniel Stern) who, added to all his other problems, finds his theatre infested with a severe case of 17-year-old spandex-wrapped kid sister (Stacy Nelkin).
Not to mention sabotage (internal and external), over zealous fire marshalls (Robert Picardo, long before ""Voyager""), uncooperative bands that won't play by the rules, Electric Larry -- the word's fastest dope dealer -- running loose in the hall, bomb threats, fires, and general brouhaha, the first stirrings of love and Max's geek nephew, who's conspiring Beverley.
This is a movie for the rock'n'roll fan -- the more you know about rock'n'roll, from its very beginnings up till the moment that this film is set, the more you will enjoy it, though, lord knows, even someone who barely knows Mick Jagger from Paul Simon can still appreciate it.
The directorial style and cinematography are kinetic and surreal/scattershot, we slide in and out of hallucinations, daydreams and just plain weirdness (two Rastafarians come in escorting a seven foot high walking talking spliff with eyes and a mouth, among the items confiscated during body searches at the door are a 500-pound bomb and a full keg of beer, not to mention a full length shotgun; the men's room has to be seen -- and will be -- to be believed and the crowdare totally bizarre).
Jokes are crammed in everywhere; as an example of the sort of thing i mean, consider the drummer in the Wanker's band -- His name is Toad (the title of a Ginger Baker drum solo piece), he is played by John Densmore (drummer for the Doors) and looks and sounds like Keith Moon.
In the end, of course, everything comes out exactly as it ought, vilains paid out, virtue rewarded, the seventeen-year-old virgin (male) on the stage crew gets over it, rather spectacularly ... and wait till you see (or rather, don't see, but meet) the Wanker's new manager...
The usual ex-Corman-protege obligatory cameo actors are -- Dick Miller, Mary Woronov and the late Dick Bartel, plus others.
And make sure you watch the end credits till the very end, and keep your eyes open throughout for references to other films (especially ones in which two or more members of this cast appeared together).
If you liked ""Rock'n'Roll High School"", you must not miss this.
((With any luck, the DVD will include the video for Bette Midler's cover of the Stones' ""Beast of Burden"" that Arkush shot on the same set at the same time, in which both Stacy Nelkin and the *real* Mick Jagger have walk-ons...))

This film is a wildly artistic thrill ride. Easily one of the greatest motion picutres to have ever existed upon Earth.",1356480000,,289,4.37037037037037
7939758,5,B00005JKQ7,"This movie is an absolute must for anyone who grew up in the 1980s. As an underground cult classic, there is no logical explanation as to why this movie has not been made available on DVD.

PLEASE RELEASE THIS MOVIE ON DVD!",1303344000,,223,4.309523809523809
7939759,5,B00005JKQ7,"Absolutely one of the funniest, most over the top rock 'n' roll movies ever made. It captures all of the excesses of the late 60s and 70s through the corporatization of music in the early 80s (screw you, MTV). Why this isn't on DVD yet is beyond me. It's a crime. I found a bootlegged copy on DVD on ebay and watch that a few times a year, but they really do need to release the Electric Larry version with every bonus feature and extra they can find. Shalom!",1286841600,,459,4.168539325842697
7939760,5,B00005JKQ7,"I have been watching this movie since it came out in 1983.  I watch it at least 5-7 times a year.  Perhaps more.  It is a rollercoaster ride of exagerated characters and rock n roll, blues, new wave and punk music that will have you bopping your head and snapping your fingers.

  It may only be available on VHS.  But, you'll thank me for this one.  Please put this on DVD.",1246060800,,374,4.169014084507042

I want the Queen to enjoy Reggie. I don't normally beg, but here goes....PS and please release it DOWNUNDER.",1214438400,,257,4.16
7939762,5,B00005JKQ7,"Like many of you, I need to add this one to my DVDs. My VHS copy is almost totally trash now and the wonderful comedy in this is priceless!! For those of us who grew up in the 60s and came of age in the 70s, this is the story of our world. Please Please Please bring it back to us on DVD because you know, ""Times a trip man!!""",1214265600,,326,3.6714285714285713
7939763,5,B00005JKQ7,Gotta echo the other reviewers sentiments on this one...worth the price of admission for the multiple renditions of Hoochie Coochir Man alone...not to mention a hilarious Howard Kaylon!!! We are waiting....,1192579200,,206,5.67741935483871

7939765,5,B00005JKQ7,"Ah, I long for those ""good old days"".  The kids today missed sooooooo many good times.  Nobody bothered anyone and everything was cool.  Of course, I exaggerate, but it was pretty close to being able to do anything you wanted and being able to enjoy it, without ""the man""  telling you everything that gives pleasure is ""bad"". Teenagers in the ""50's"" had maltshops and school dances, in the ""60's"" it was find a place to lite up,turn on, and drop out, the 70's and 80's we had the Filmore East type places to socialize.  Today's youth really have no place to ""hang out"", either they're with parents or in front of the computer. Not very healthy either way.  I'll get off my soapbox now.  Enjoy!",1148601600,7,693,4.496
