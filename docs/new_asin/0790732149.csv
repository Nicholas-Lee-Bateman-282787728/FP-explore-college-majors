103525,4,0790732149,"Conspiracies, corruption, cover ups.  Welcome to Washington D.C.  Nothing new there, but a murder in the White House along with all the corruption  and cover ups makes for a good story.  Snipes, D.C. homicide cop, is called  in to investigate.  Through the political jungle that surrounds the White  House and its denizens, Snipes makes his way through to the truth with the  help of a Secret Service agent, played very well by Lane. Twists and turns  abound, which is one of the elements that make the movie so enjoyable.  It  was just an all around fun movie, and more believable than a lot of other  action, who-done-it films.",969408000,3,629,4.722222222222222

The story is quite good and Dwight Little direction keeps the film  interesting all the way. The DVD sound and picture quality is very good.  This movie also features my favorite actress, Diane Lane. She is so good in  the role of Secret service. I am so disappointed she was not even  considered to replace Jodie Foster in the sequel of Silence of the lamb  (Julianne Moore got the part). The producer should have seen this movie  before made the decision. Anyway it is a great entertaining DVD to be added  to your collection. You won't be sorry.",966211200,2,700,4.544

103593,4,0790732149,"Murder at 1600, 1997 film

This was adapted from the novel Murder in the White House by Margaret Truman. Its story of murder and intrigue that may have been inspired by actual events but dramatized to make it interesting. The story recalls various political events over the past decades.

A young woman is found murdered in the White House! She was a friend of the Presidents son. But a maintenance worker is arrested for the crime. Could he be a scapegoat? A Washington detective continues his investigation. The Secret Service agents resents his presence there now that a suspect is found. But the investigation goes on. There is a crisis when a AWACS airplane was shot down in North Korea. The military advisor suggests a military raid instead of negotiations. Who ordered that airplane to go into that area? A provocation? The President rejects this advice. Then there is an assassination! That Washington detective and a Secret Servie agent see this and shoot back. [There is a lot of guns and shooting in this movie.]

That detective and SS agent learn the Presidents son was being framed in order to embarrass the President and force him to resign in favor of a man who will take military action against North Korea in spite of the latters alliance with Red China. Can the President be warned before he resigns? Will the good guys win in the end and the bad guys be caught? There is a mention of a Senator who was in a scandal when he had a car accident.

Movies like Executive Action or The Parallax View were better as drama. Watch them and see. All the Presidents Men and JFK are based on true crimes. Seven Days in May is an older movie that asks about intrigue in the White House.",1480032000,,1692,4.574257425742574

103656,5,0790732149,"After I saw this movie on TV and kept watching it every time it was on I decided it was time to own it. Wesley Snipes plays the part of a DC homicide detective who is in the position of having to solve the murder of a woman who was found stabbed to death in one of the White House bathrooms. However, his investigation is hampered by the Secret Service because they withhold information he needs on the grounds that it is top secret and he is not cleared to have it. To make matters worse, the president's son soon becomes a suspect and the president is being criticized by both members of his administration and the public for not going to war with North Korea in order to rescue hostages they're holding. Finally, though, he convinces one of the agents (Diane Lane) that the person the White House is accusing of the murder is innocent and tells her that if she can watch an innocent man burn for something he didn't do then fine, but he can't. Well, she can't either, so she helps him find the real murderer - and talk about a surprise ending!",1454198400,4,1046,4.314720812182741
103657,5,0790732149,"An absolutely smart, entertaining thriller.  Hard to believe it was made in 1997. Except for the aggressive store salesman pushing the latest VCR models, there's little to remind you of the time period.  Wesley Snipes does an outstanding job, along with the female co-star Diane Lane, as homicide detective and secret service agent trying to solve a murder at the white house. Two favorite actors of mine, Alan Alda and Daniel Benzali, add they're special spices to the drama.  So glad the producers didn't try to add a romance into the movie plot, it would've killed the action and suspense.

Wonderful afternoon watching a good movie that somehow slipped by me all these years.",1454112000,2,679,4.9298245614035086

Being somewhat of a fan of his complicated humor, I was delighted to see him in this movie. He acted in a way that is pretty consistent with who I believe him to be.

A good cast romps through a thriller in which a woman is found murdered in the White House and the chief suspect has to be from among a limited group who had admittance to the building after normal working and visiting hours. A detective from the DC police force is assigned to the case but the Secret Service sharply limits his access to possibly vital material evidence and witnesses. The detective finds that this being a case which can affect the politics of the Presidency. he is forced to take short-cuts to try to do his job. We are also treated to the in-fighting within the inner circle of advisors to the President as to the policy to be  pursued to get back from the North Koreans American servicemen who were on a plane that came down in their territory.
You will enjoy this melange of ""it can't really happen"" if you are simply able to identify with the police officer and go along with the politics regardless of any doubts you may have about the their reality or possibility. You may also have some doubts that security  at the White House is quite what it is made out to be in crucial scenes of the movie.

103936,3,0790732149,"The movie ""Murder at 1600"" is far from excellent but it is worth viewing.  There is some sexual tension between Wesley Snipes and Diane Lane and Alan Alda is cast against type as a villian.  Daniel J. Travanti is also fine.  The plot is actually fairly predictable.  I like Wesley Snipes as an actor but this is not his finest role.  He plays a D. C. homocide detective who has to investigate the murder of a staffer that occurs in the White House. Of course, his investigation causes him to bump heads with the White House chief of staff, Travanti and other bureaucrats including the Secret Service. Some of the plot twists are a little far fetched as Diane Lane character being an excellent marksman who won gold at the Olympics.

I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it but also, as with most films set in Washington, D. C. the geography is not quite right.  This movie does have some humor as the fact that Wesley Snipes is about to be evicted from his home by some government agency and the tenants in the building think that as a detective, he could influence the eviction.

If this movie was coming out now, I do not know if it would be worth the price of a ticket at the multiplex but to rent it and watch it at home would be fine. Especially if you are a fan of Snipes, Alda, or Diane Lane.  They are all fine.  The movie could have been a bit better written.  Dennis Miller is Snipes partner but he comes and goes in the movie and this hurts his overall impact in the film. The actor who plays the president seems a little weak to actually be a president.

103963,5,0790732149,"Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) is a good detective and he takes a lot of tough cases.  He gets the call to go to a murder scene.  At first he thinks it has to be a joke until he sees the dead body in the restroom that one of the maids found.  After all who expects to find a beautiful blond woman who is dead in the restroom down the hall from the oval office at the White House and 40 yards from the Presidents bedroom?

The woman was a 24 year old, Carla Town, and she has been dead for about 3 hours.  The first family is at Camp David since the day before.  Harlan is wanted about as much in the White House as someone with a contagious disease.  Key White House staff members are arguing who is in case of the investigation.  The White house Secret Service Chief and the National Security Advisor are arguing who is in charge of a murder case.

Nina Chance (Diane Lane) is a liaison assigned to work with Harlan; she is a Secret Service Agent.  They go to Carla's apartment and it looks sanitized as the feds had arrived 15 minutes after they found the body the night before.  All of the photos are missing from her photo album.  Harlan found a receipt ticket in a magazine and keeps the evidence....

The USA in already under stress and American soldiers are being held hostage in North Korea.  The President is saying to have patience.  His entire staff is against him in how he is handling the situation.

What follows is an intense film with everyone considered a suspect.  Were there 30 or 31 people in the White House that night?  Harlan doesn't know because he is being feed half-truths and lies.  The only straight information he is getting is from Nina.  Harlan is moving in power circles and at events way over his status and he fights to do the right thing and not be intimidated.

This story is about a power struggle at the top of the American political scene and Harlan is trapped in the middle while trying to find out the truth and not be accused of being a traitor to America.  Is the president guilty or is someone just trying to disgrace him and him family?

When the local police arrive the ""coverup"" starts. The local police detective is played by one of my favorite actors Wesley Snipes. As the investigation progresses, we start learning of missing information and false leads. On the surface, it looks like an odd murder; deeper we learn that it is a plot to ultimately force the president to resign. So the movie is interesting with several surprises and plot twists. My only complaint is that it is a long movie considering its contents. I could probably cut 30 minutes from it and make it move faster; each scene is about 10 seconds longer than it needs to be.

Under the eternally captured eyes of Washington and Jefferson, a lovely young blonde is having sex in one of the rooms in the White House.  Soon a maid discovers her body in a stall in the restroom.  She has been stabbed to death.  Uh-oh, is this going to be a problem or what?

MURDER AT 1600 has a lot of incredible plot contrivances that don't work unless you go ahead, suspend your belief, and enjoy the ride.  Dwight Little's competent direction allows us to do that.  Remember, it's just a movie, and even though its plot seems a bit far-fetched at times, it works as an engrossing thriller.  Wesley Snipes is convincing as a no-nonsense DC homicide detective who forces himself onto the investigation, which should have been federally handled since it took place on Federal property.  But then we wouldn't have had a movie.  Diane Lane in a rare ""action"" role is marvelous as Dena Chance, the secret service liaison who realizes a cover up is going on.  Daniel Benzali (from the critically acclaimed but short-lived tv series MURDER ONE) chews up the scenery as the head of security and the always delightful Alan Alda gives fine support as the head of NSA.  It was nice to see the still lovely Diane Baker as the First Lady (I remember her so fondly from those 60s tearjerkers and of course as the murderess in STRAIT JACKET); Ronny Cox is an appropriately wimpy president; and Tate Donovan does well in the underdeveloped role of the president's sexually promiscous son.

Murder at 1600 is a serious movie that you can't take too seriously, not if you want to enjoy it.  Wesley Snipes has a few humorous bits, and Dennis Miller is his normally wisecracking self, and I think the movie perhaps benefits from this remote air of unreality due to its subject matter - after all, the brutal murder of a young woman inside the White House is some pretty serious stuff.  The other main aspect of the film, which supplies the motive for the murder in the first place, is - granted - a little bit out there, and that is where the subtle sense of unreality pays dividends; without it, it would really be hard to get from here to there.
Carla Towne is a young unknown White House staffer - until her body is found in a White House restroom sporting a number of deadly knife wounds.  This is not good news for the President, who is already bottoming out in the polls for still attempting to negotiate, six months into the crisis, the release of an AWAC crew captured and obviously tortured by the North Koreans.  Wesley Snipes plays Detective Harlan Regis, the investigator summoned to the White House to investigate the murder.  The Secret Service as an organization is less than friendly and cooperative, viewing the White House as its beat alone.  Except for his buddy and sometimes partner (played by Dennis Miller), Regis is pretty much on his own.  The tight-lipped and intimidating Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), the chief of White House security and definite contender for the next Lex Luthor look-alike contest (his Marlon Brando impersonation isn't half bad, either) assigns Agent Nina Chance (Diane Lane) as Regis' liaison with the Secret Service.  Spikings doesn't mess around, and once he has tabbed an individual for the murder, he wants Chance to have nothing to do with Regis.  The detective is pretty persistent, though, and Chance has to weigh her sense of duty against her sense of justice.
The list of suspects is quite fluid, and I think the movie does a very good job of sustaining suspense and the sense of mystery throughout.  The facts as Regis acquires them make not only the President's philandering son, but the President himself possible suspects.  Then you have the crisis with North Korea coming to the fore, with the President really frustrating his top advisors with his incredibly wimpy refusal to risk war with North Korea over the military hostage crisis.  The truth, when it comes, does push the envelope to some degree, but it is certainly logical in the given context.  I didn't ID the real bad guy any sooner than Regis and Chance did, so that to me is a good thing.
A great mystery, plenty of action, power politics, lust, murder, conspiracy inside conspiracy: Murder in 1600 offers the viewers all of this and more.  The ending itself is well done in my opinion, as well.  Thus, this reviewer counts this as an impressive and very entertaining thriller.",1080345600,28,3013,4.71047619047619
104017,3,0790732149,"Any movie that allows former-M*A*S*H star Alan Alda to play against type is worth a look.
Star Snipes adds another ""action role"" to his ever-expanding arsenal of ""kick butt"" types. Diane Lane, Ronny Cox, and Daniel Benzali supply enough backing to make this thriller passable.
The appearance of Diane Baker as the President's wife makes the movie work for me.",1058400000,,359,5.0
104018,3,0790732149,"Wesley Snipes stars as a DC homicide cop brought into the White House to help solve the brutal murder of a White House staffer.  He gets very little support from the Secret Service, who want the matter resolved quickly, even if that means bending the facts a little.  Snipes begins to realize that there is a coverup in progress and that he is only one man standing against the machinery of Washington.  Snipes is a good fit for this role, not relying on simply mugging and attitude like he sometimes does.  Diane Lane as the Secret Service agent assigned as his liason gives the film's best performance.  She really deserves to get her ""breakout"" role that would give her a shot at better scripts than this one.  It starts out promisingly, but the mystery and action becomes increasingly ridiculous as it moves along.  The supporting cast are never given a chance to flesh out their roles as their characters do things that don't make much sense. By the ending of the film, the best I could muster was, ""Yeah, right.""  A murder mystery involving top level political cover ups in Washington is a ripe topic to say the least.  But this was a good idea that needed a lot of reworking before filming.  It's a wasted opportunity.",1036281600,5,1225,4.6036866359447
104019,2,0790732149,"The film starts out with a ridiculous scene involving a suicide that Wesley saves by cold cocking, and the film never gets any less absurd. As contrived thrillers go, this one was pure Hollywood, complete with dopey plot twists that make less sense the more you think about them. Plodding, pointless and pedestrian, Murder At 1600 is so dull it actually put me to sleep twice, I finally did finish it, though I admit that I fast-forwarded through the tedious fight scenes at the end, will Wesley die? Snipes mugs through the whole film, with then trendy cigar conspicuously in place. Even Dennis Miller was dull.  You really don't need to see this flick, although I was amused when Wesley read the big bad guy his rights while in handcuffs.",1026777600,7,740,4.6923076923076925
104020,1,0790732149,"OK, there are times you want to relax by watching something easy and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself. But in summary, this movie was way too lame and predictable, better left on the shelves.",998956800,2,966,4.755952380952381

It's a clever thriller, character driven, and still fresh even though it was released in 1997; over 20 years ago.
