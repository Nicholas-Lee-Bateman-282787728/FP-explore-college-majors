8712690,5,B00WAKL7VO,"My nephew so I am biased. Basically it was the story of my marriage, which lasted 37 years until Flo's death from cancer. We never knew the author, but the movie was much too short for me.",1438732800,,188,4.108108108108108
8712691,4,B00WAKL7VO,"This is an entertaining film. I would have liked to have more backstory on each character but I gather you can only do so much in a half an hour. Nudity was tasteful. Cursing was sparse and appropriate.

Something in the ending credits blew me away, but I won't spoil the surprise. I didn't buy the DVD but instead streamed it online for a few dollars.",1433980800,,352,4.333333333333333
8712692,5,B00WAKL7VO,This is a really nice little film. I was expecting something a little raunchy but was pleasently surprised.,1432684800,,107,5.0
