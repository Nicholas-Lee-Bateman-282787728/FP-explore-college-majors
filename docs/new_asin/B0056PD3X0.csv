8459857,3,B0056PD3X0,this movie does not have as much fish porn as I would hope.  Lots of talking about what it takes to be a musky fisherman,1496361600,,120,3.8
8459858,5,B0056PD3X0,"This is long overdue! There are more and more people getting into these beasts of fish with fly gear, and this is a look into the lives of some guys who put their soul into it. I don't care what kind of fisherman you are you'll find something that you relate to in this film. Also the bonus sections make you feel like they're giving this thing away.",1373760000,,350,4.161764705882353
8459859,5,B0056PD3X0,This is a high quality fly fishing movie. A good watch for any fly fisher. Makes you want to drive to musky country.,1360368000,,116,4.086956521739131
8459860,3,B0056PD3X0,"As a life long fly angler that fishes for everything that swims with a fly, I enjoy and own almost every fly fishing dvd that has been made. I looked forward to this one because it offered something different than most other dvd's out there, but I was a bit let down by it. It is 90% these guys TALKING about musky fishing rather than doing it. Understandably it is harder to fill a dvd with footage of musky after musky, but if you only have a few actual ""catches"" to put on the dvd then wait till you can offer more action footage till you release the dvd. It was okay to fill a boring mid winter Michigan evening and get my ""fishing fix"" for the day, but certainly was not anywhere near as good as I expected. The trailer was the most action from the entire dvd.",1358985600,,765,4.140939597315437
8459861,2,B0056PD3X0,"I've been an avid muskie fisher for over 40 years. Most of those have been using bait casting and spinning gear. About 5 years ago, I started chasing them with a fly rod, and tie all my own flies. I find it reasonably productive until the 4th of July...then I have more consistent success (if there is such a thing in muskie fishing) going back to baitcasting.

Fly fishing for muskie, even more so than baitcasting, is damn hard. However, it is far from ""mystic"" as these guys seem to imply. It's no different, in my opinion, than fly fishing for anything ( and I've caught several pike, lakers, tarpon, bonita, bass, etc).

To say that it is more ""natural"" or whatever, than fishing a wooden plug on a baitcasting rod, is absurd!! Fishing, of any kind, is wonderful. Me....I prefer fly fishing, but will use any type of gear if the occasion calls for it.

These guys act like it is some kind of holy grail, only pursued by a chosen few. I say....get a job and a real life.

This video was greatly disapppointing.",1339286400,,1014,4.435483870967742
8459862,5,B0056PD3X0,"I saw this piece on this years fly fishing film tour and thought it was hands down the best piece in the line-up. I recently purchased this DVD and I can't say enough about it. It's much longer than the tour version and has a lot of great extra features. You don't have to be a musky person to enjoy watching this film...heck, I've never fished for muskies in my life and I'm not sure if I ever will. Musky Country is definitely one of the best fly fishing DVD's I have ever seen.
The story, photography, editing and music are all incredible. It even has Dolby 5.1 surround which I've never seen on any other fly fishing DVD. You will not be disappointed with this DVD!!!",1313452800,,671,4.291338582677166
