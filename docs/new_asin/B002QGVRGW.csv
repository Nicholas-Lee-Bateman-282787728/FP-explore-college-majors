Great for preschoolers. IF YOU ONLY USE IT FOR ONE CHILD YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE THIS CHEAPER BY GETTING AN ONLINE MEMBERSHIP THROUGHT THE KINDERBACH WEBSITE. I LIKE HAVING THE DVDS, BUT IF YOU DON't mind ONLINE videos that might be the way to go. Plus you'll want levels 1-3 first.",1377388800,,444,4.2976190476190474
