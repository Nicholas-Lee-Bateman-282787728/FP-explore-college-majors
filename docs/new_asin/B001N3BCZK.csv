Who wants to spend 10 minutes watching shadows creep across a room at a snails pace? If thats art, well then ok. I was bored and had to fast forward through every scene on the disc.",1239148800,,290,4.105263157894737
8323029,4,B001N3BCZK,I found the Surrealist Motion Blu-ray really nice for showing of our Pioneer Kuro HDTV. I have used it a couple of times when we have had people over and they all find it rather amusing that there is movement in the paintings. The limitations of the content (four scenes  10-15 mins) is the reason for not giving it 5 stars as the picture quality is awesome and the idea is new and novel.,1239062400,,388,4.243243243243243
