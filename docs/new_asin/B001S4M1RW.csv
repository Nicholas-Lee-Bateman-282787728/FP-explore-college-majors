I can't wait for another video from these guys.  (The sable they hunt is a trophy of a lifetime!)  Very intense hunting to say the least.  If you like hunting deep Africa, this video is a Must!",1362441600,,361,4.159420289855072
8339429,5,B001S4M1RW,"This is a very well produced hunting video that bears up under repeated viewing. The elephant hunting and leopard scenes are particularly fine. A nasty leopard bite and clawing at the sharp end. That had to hurt, especially after the adrenaline wore off. Highly recommended!",1296518400,2,274,5.111111111111111
