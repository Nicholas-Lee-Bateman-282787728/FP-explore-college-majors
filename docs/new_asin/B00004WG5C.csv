8169437,5,B00004WG5C,"I like all the Ripping Yarns, some are better than others, but my favorite is in this collection: ""The Curse Of The Claw"". This bit is so great, that I never get tired of watching it. Michael Palin is wonderful in a dual role, as both the innocent boy Kevin and his hilariously diseased Uncle Jack. The actors who play his unbelievably oppressive parents are great. Everything is top-notch, the atmosphere, acting, dialogue, and the ending. This, and all the Ripping Yarns, are full of very subtle but hilarious humor that may go over the heads of many.
I don't want to give too much away, Mr. Russell. If you like Python, and you've never seen this, get it now! I wish they would release this on DVD.",1014249600,4,701,4.484375

The Testing of Eric Olthwaite (1934):  Michael Palin has two roles in this episode.  He plays Eric  Olthwaite, a very boring young man.  His only interests or should I say  obsessions are black pudding, shovels, and especially the weather.  He is  so boring that his mom, dad, and sister run away from home.  He askes his  girlfriend for help but she is too busy having a fling.  Poor Eric, he goes  and searches for them.  After receiving some friendly advice he decides to  change his life and apply at a bank.  Michael also plays the head bank  teller.  It is an interesting scene with both characters speaking to each  other.  Suddenly a bank teller comes in and takes Eric hostage.  Soon  Eric's life takes a bizzare turn and he is not so boring after all.  It's a  funny episode and the song at the end is very catchy.
Winfrey's Last Case  (1921):  The Germans are planning to start the war a year early, who do  they call on to be the hero?  Michael Palin plays General Winfrey.  He  refuses by telling them he needs a holiday.  He leaves for his holiday, but  it has a few funny turns.  He goes into an empty pub where he is served by  an old women whose arms and hands are the only thing you see.  She even  drives him up to Smugglers Cottage.  Don't attempt this stunt ever.  He  goes up to Smugglers Cottage where he is greeted by 16 servants in a very  small home.  Later on one of the servants is trying to kill him but thanks  to the 23 exits he manages to escape.  Now another bizzare turn happens to  General Winfrey, and somehow he becomes the hero.  The scenery is beautiful  and makes a great vacation spot.
Murder at Moorstone Manor (1926):  Stephen King could not of written anything this scary, or should I say  funny.  This episode has Michael Palin playing three characters.  This is  quite a challenge, but Michael pulls it off beautifully. He starts out as  an old man named Kevin who is alone and is greeted by an explorer and his  trible.  He tells the explorer a story of fear, tragedy, and terror.  The  story is about THE CLAW!  He tells about his childhood and his visits with  Uncle Jack.  Michael plays Uncle Jack who has more diseases than anyone.  Michael also plays Kevin in his mid 20's.  Again, both characters are  speaking to each other.  Uncle Jack tells Kevin he must deliver the claw  back to the rightful owners.  He is unsucessful on his trip, but later on  the claw reappears.  How it ends is unusual.  I like this episode because  it is funny, and again Michael does a great job with all three characters.",962064000,5,2666,4.3921161825726145
