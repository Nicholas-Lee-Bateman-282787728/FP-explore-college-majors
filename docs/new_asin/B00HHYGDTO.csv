6165308,5,B00HHYGDTO,"Caught this film at a sold out screening at a film festival last fall.  They literally they had to bring in folding chairs for the extra people.

This is one of those films that catches you completely off guard.  One that leave you breathless by it's finale.  As a member of that sold out audience, I can tell you well all sat silent and stunned when the end credits rolled.

Broken Side of Time is a journey about growing up, about the choices we make.  Especially the sometimes questionable choices we women make.  And about realizing you're not 18 any more and need to start over.

Broken Side of Time is a film that breathes, that lets you into the head and heart of Jane, who's played by an amazing actress that I had never seen before.  It allows the you to feel, to emphasize, to grasp what she's going through, and struggle along with her on this journey ""home.""  The lead performance is amazing.  The actress won Best Actress at that film festival for good reason.  It's a very brave, raw portrayal.

Broken Side of Time is set in the world of internet modeling.  A world I never really knew existed, and yet one site I looked up had over 800,000 portfolios online.  A world that seems as sad as it is beautiful and that seems to exist as much for photography, as it does for random hookups.  Looking at some of the photos on those sites, it's also a world where anyone can call themselves a ""photographer"" or ""model.""  Who knew?  Well, obviously the film makers behind this movie, who crack this internet modeling world open, exposing both its artistic and not-so-artistic sides.

Broken Side of Time is a film for film lovers, as long as you're a film lover not easily offended by sex and nudity.  If you loved Starlet or Blue is the Warmest Color, then don't hesitate for a moment.  You will likewise love this film.

This is a film that is not afraid to show the dark side of the human condition.  And likewise it is a story that believes in second chances, that sees hope at the end of even the darkest tunnel.

I loved it!",1391558400,15,2037,4.399463806970509
6165309,5,B00HHYGDTO,"Greetings,

Thank you for checking out the Amazon page for my new narrative feature, ""Broken Side of Time.""

First off, the 90 minutes of EXTRAS on this DVD include:

-- 5 extended unedited photo shoots

-- a bunch of deleted scenes, extended scenes, and some really funny blooper outtakes

-- a featurette on how we created the look and feel of the film, and got it made on such a low budget using KickStarter and a very small crew, that at times consisted on only one person behind the camera.

Now...""Broken Side of Time"" is a film that grew out of making my first documentary, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Replacements-Color-Me-Obsessed-A-Film-About-The-Replacements/dp/B0091JJ24Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed: A Film About The Replacements</a>,"" and the idea of shooting a fiction film the same way we'd shoot a documentary.  No script.  Just an idea for a beginning and an end, and we'd let the footage captured dictate the story when we got to the editing room.  But I knew to make that work I needed a brilliant lead actress, so I turned to Lynn Mancinelli from my ""Friends (With Benefits).""  She will break your heart in this film.  She will speak to the wrong decisions we all make, the abuse we often times inflict upon ourself, knowing we need to stop, but unable to, until rock bottom is hit.

""Broken Side of Time"" is a story about redemption.  About starting over.  About hitting that rock bottom, and realizing you are the only one who can save yourself.  Lynn's character, Dolce, needs to reinvent herself at 30 and start over.  And that is never easy.

The 11 professional photo shoots depicted in the film were all real shoots, with some of the best photographers located on our road trip between Connecticut and Detroit.  They were shot cinma vrit style.  My camera set into a corner, capturing the action as it unfolded.  The only instructions to the photographers: Lynn had to be called by her character's name.

I'm very proud of this film.  It was made by a very small crew.  At times I was the only person behind the camera (shooting, directing, doing sound), Lynn was the only person in front of it (also doing hair and makeup).  The most crew members ever on set numbered 5 during the bar scenes, proof that a small collection of people who really know what they're doing can make a film look as good as a crew of 20 or 60 or more.

By ordering this DVD you are supporting indie film the way it was meant to be.  (This is not a $20 million dollar Hollywood version of ""independent"" cinema.)  I truly think you'll find ""Broken Side of Time"" raw and heartbreaking, and Lynn's performance beautiful.  Hopefully it's a film that will stay with you for a long long time.  A film that you will return to, finding some deeper meaning each time you watch it.  Spotting a shot that you somehow missed the first time around.  One that now takes your breath away.

Thank you for coming along with us on this amazing ride.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Until next time...

8632890,4,B00HHYGDTO,"A powerful film that invites the viewer to settle into the seedier, bleaker side of life as ""Dolce"" tries to find her way to a new place from a past that no longer serves her at all. The cinematography is at once too real to ignore, and grittily surreal. A haunting portrait of a woman facing herself and her choices in life's cheap hotel mirror, complete with cracks and corrosion, and finding a way back to clarity. Moving.",1409270400,,425,4.461538461538462

8632893,4,B00HHYGDTO,"This was a dark journey for the Dolce/Jane (Lynn Mancinelli) and the viewer is right there with her. You see her at her lowest, indulging in the vices a lifestyle with no center and sustained by illusion, smoke, and mirrors, provide. You experience her world, from her eyes, and together come to a realization that the ride must come to an end. So, one more trip down the rabbit hole. Only this time, not to stay, but to say, ""goodbye"". On the road for one more stab at all the things that made this her lifestyle of choice. Indulge in one more drug binge, one more casual sex encounter, one last great photoshoot. With each experience, she sheds her demons. In the end, there is redemption in coming home.",1402617600,3,706,4.48062015503876
