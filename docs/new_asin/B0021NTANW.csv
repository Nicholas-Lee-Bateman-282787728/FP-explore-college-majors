8349279,5,B0021NTANW,"I watched this series as it was released on SBS.  I couldn't have asked for a better history lesson on the Country I was becoming a resident of.  It certainly helped me understand the mindset of some people I have met. I watched the PM apologize for the Stolen Generation live... anyway, excellent documentary. I would recommend this to anyone thinking of visiting, or dreaming that Australia is any 'better' than anywhere else at this point.",1390003200,,442,4.802631578947368
8349280,5,B0021NTANW,"I wonder if this was made right around the time that the Australian Prime Minister made that half-hearted apology to Aboriginals for all the ways in which the Western man has jerked them over.  For many Americans, our first exposure to Aboriginals may be the new movie ""The Sapphires.""  I once met a (white) New Zealand woman who said, ""The Maoris and Aboriginals are vastly different.  The Maoris fought hard and well against the English, but the Aboriginals just didn't have the numbers, war skills, and organization to do the same.""  There's a documentary called ""Flight of the Courtesans"" that spoke of the first white women in Australia.  That documentary stressed that there were not enough Aboriginal women around for all the English to have female companions.  These are all things running through my head as I watched this well-done documentary.

In short, this work shows how Aboriginals were screwed over and beat down just like Native Americans and African Americans have been in my own country.  Western diseases killed them off like how Native Americans were done.  Aboriginals had many treaties broken by other Aussies.  Aboriginals face a lot of awful media portrayals just like African Americans were insulted by minstrelsy imagery.  It was great to hear that Aboriginals in the 1960s were inspired by Black American activism of that period.

To things stood out as different to me.  First, the work discusses an Aboriginal woman who worked with a white man on issues decades ago.  Unlike Pocahontas or la Malinche, it's never assumed that their dynamic had a sexual or romantic component.  In the US, we have the one-drop rule which says anyone who is part Black is deemed Black.  The Australians used a divide and conquer strategy in which biracial Aboringinals were ripped from their communities.  Both strategies can be read as oppressive.

I must admit, in the same way that it's hard to watch documentaries on Native Americans and Black Americans since they faced so much unfairness, all the oppression here can be soul-draining too.  Further, this work was several hours long and many folk in our rush-rush, post-modern era just don't have the patience to sit through something so long.",1378166400,4,2210,5.005479452054795
