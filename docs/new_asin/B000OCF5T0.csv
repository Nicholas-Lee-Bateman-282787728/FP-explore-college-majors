Thanks for the warnings!

Amazon needs to get this perpetrator off of their vendor list. I thought there was a law about making pirated copies.

I ran into another vendor who was doing the same thing with cheap, home copies of the last Dallas TV sequel movie which he could not resist filling with advertising for his business on his pirated TV recorded transfer DVD.

Beware when they say NEW and sealed.... that can be a pirated cheap copy. Look for factory sealed or manufacturer sealed and words like Original... etc. And check the vendor's ratings.",1198627200,,732,4.651162790697675
8184223,3,B000OCF5T0,"Not only are these episodes edited for commercial television (the original prints were shown on Showtime), but these boxes do not contain the *complete* seasons.

The first box contains episodes from Seasons 1 & 2.  Out of a total of 43 episodes, you get 20.  The second box contains episodes from Season 3, and this is almost complete --- 20 out of 22 episodes.

It's unfortunate that the U.S. release of this series was botched --- first by releasing ""theme anthologies"" when every other TV show was being issued in complete season boxes; then finally using the complete first season shortly thereafter, forcing collectors to buy episodes they already owned.  More than two years have gone by and we're still waiting to see if the rest of the series will ever be released on DVD.

Since that's far from certain, you may want to buy one of these Canadian sets; but remember that you're getting edited versions (with nudity deleted) and you may not get some of your favorite episodes.  Also, the video and sound on these versions is not as good as the U.S. releases.",1186704000,23,1066,4.698924731182796
8184224,4,B000OCF5T0,"If you are an outer limits fan you know how frustrating MGM's senseless delay in releasing the remaining episodes has been.  After much searching I became aware of the existence of seasons 2 - 4 as a Canadian release.  They were available on Amazon Canada some time ago but I was late looking and they were no longer available.  When I saw these were available I ordered them knowing that they would be the sanitized Canadian releases.  I am very happy with the quality of the DVD's (beats recording episodes on Showtime or Sci-Fi).  If you are not willing to wait for MGM to get its act together and can deal with the edited versions of the series (hey, keep them around to show the kids) I recommend these highly.  If you need the full unedited episodes (as I hope to have at some point) contact MGM.  You'll pobably get the same response I did - nothing.",1183852800,11,857,4.420382165605096
8184225,1,B000OCF5T0,"ALERT! These are the ""sanitized"" ""PG"" drastically mutilated versions with no extras. Don't be devastated like I was when I discovered that I had paid a King's Ransom for these Canadian rip-offs. WAIT for the new MGM releases of seasons 2 thru 7 that are coming out eventually. NETFLIX has just listed them, but without release dates. I'm assuming that the MGM's will be intact because their first 2 sets are complete and the ""extras"" etc are superb...",1183248000,15,451,4.794871794871795
