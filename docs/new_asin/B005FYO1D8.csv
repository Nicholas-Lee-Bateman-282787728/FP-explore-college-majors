- amazing soundtrack
- solid performances
- great script  ( even for a portuguese like me )
- one of the most beautiful love stories that I've seen in the last years
- CGI kept as a minimum for an historical film
- absolutely comparable with western epic movies",1362355200,,287,4.519230769230769
8470864,5,B005FYO1D8,"I love this film and everything about it. Santosh Sivan is amazing. The only problem I had with this film concerned the subtitles - I wish they were better. Because I watched the dubbed Telugu version of Urumi and the subtitles were more detailed, if that makes sense. Also the MoserBaer ads were annoying, but they quickly went away.

I ordered this DVD on November 2 (after a futile search at my local Desi video store) and it arrived on November 8, in excellent quality. I would definitely recommend the seller, too.

Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase!",1352505600,,561,4.714285714285714
8470865,3,B005FYO1D8,"I really love this movie - a Vasco da Gama conquest of south India from the Indian point of view. Part history, part legend. Great actors, director, camera. The movie itself deservs 5 stars, there is no doubt.
But the DVD release itself does not! Picture is fine, subtitles make sense, only they are missing at some places! And what's WORSE - every so often you have this sign Buy OnLine from bla bla - across one fifth of the screen. Usually in the moment when you need to see what's happening on the bottom of the screen. I really would appreciate Indian movie releases without any of those troublesome non-skippable trailers at the beginning of the movie and another commercials IN the movie. That's why I buy original DVD - not to be bothered with these!!!! Seriously!",1343260800,,772,4.601449275362318
