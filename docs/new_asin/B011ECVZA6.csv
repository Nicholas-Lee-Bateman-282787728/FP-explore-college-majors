8724159,2,B011ECVZA6,"Switching from viewpoint to viewpoint undercuts this ""recovered footage"" film. The direction and script add little to this frequently used sci-fi plot, and the revealed events provide little character development.",1524355200,,213,6.133333333333334
8724160,5,B011ECVZA6,"This is one of the few found footage films that is good. Without spoiling the movie, the found footage style works great with stuff that happens and the characters use it in an interesting way sometimes. The characters are well developed and you know and care about each one. Following these kids on their journey as they discover what is happening to them is thrilling and several times I found myself jealous that I was not taking part in what was happening on screen. It's a great original movie. It's not a prequal, remake or a sequel. It's just good and you should give it a shot.",1505692800,,585,4.4766355140186915
