2061640,5,B000244GCW,"John Lithgow does a great job in the lead role, although I believe his past life, as it affected his current situation, could have been more developed.  The story is painfully true and intriguing.  I recommend this film for the story, the suspense and the superb acting by John Lithgow.",1270771200,7,286,4.7
2061641,4,B000244GCW,"This movie is set in a time not that long ago, when a young fallen hero who happened to be black could not be buried in his hometown cemetery.  It is handled with sensitivity and honesty.",1267920000,9,187,4.194444444444445
2061642,5,B000244GCW,"Although made in 1986, the story which is the subject of this film is still relevant because 24 years later, prejudice still exists. But even if it weren't, it's a wonderful film. The acting is superb; the directing, nuanced. Rather than beating you over the head with the message, the audience is drawn into the story. This film truly deserves five stars.",1266192000,10,356,4.758064516129032
2061643,5,B000244GCW,"Given the recent wars in Iraq, this story about an African-American soldier's family seeking to have him buried as a Vietnam Veteran in the town's cemetary is a very moving and powerful story, even though it is two decades old now.  It is very sad, as well, that America continues to have to confront such issues as a result of the policy misadventures of those in Washington, while young men and women from small-town America who had so much promise in civilian life make the ultimate sacrifice.  All the cast give excellent performances.  As powerful and relevant as any contemporary account of war's impact on the lives of others at home, and on the survivors who return home deeply traumatised and forever changed by their exposure to conflict.",1246147200,48,748,4.828125

2061645,5,B000244GCW,"Wow, this was a great movie. although these kind of movies get us upset because of the injustices as well as the racism that existed and still does...how unfortunate that a human life means nothing because of the color of their skin....yet, he was good enough to fight for his country....we are however glad of the outcome of the movie, although it is kind of hard to say or accept that in real life(if those circumstances still were in place) that the outcome would be the same....Don't think so.....",1238025600,45,501,4.640449438202247
2061646,5,B000244GCW,"This is one of the finest films I have seen centered on small Southern town prejudice and military procedure. The characters are all portrayed with some of the finest acting skills in the business. If I was disappointed in any way, it was with the knowledge that the story is fictional; everything about the film leads the viewer to believe that the incidence actually occurred. Nevertheless, fact or fiction, it is bound to move those who love movie drama as well as those who appreciate skillfull and accurate dramatization of military events. Five stars to the film itself, to  the actors, writers, producers and music composers.",1125273600,146,632,4.962264150943396

2061663,4,B000244GCW,"I'm a bit of a history buff - especially 20th century American history - so from that perspective, I liked that it gave a thought-provoking look at how - for so many decades - we expected young black men to die defending the 'principles' of this nation without affording them full civil rights.

It was particularly 'thought-provoking' because, if you wanted to update the story line you could replace the black family with an undocumented immigrant family and the 'whites only' cemetery to a 'citizens only' cemetery and date it 2014.

As a fan of both Lithgow & Freeman, that was an added bonus, however, as someone else noted Morgan Freeman's part was relatively small. Someone also was critical of Lithgow's acting in this film but, if you put it in the perspective of where the army stood with its own segregation issues during the Vietnam War era, I think the reticence Lithgow portrayed was right on point.

The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 was because the cinematography was very poor. It was like watching a rerun of a 1960's tv drama. But I'm glad I bought the movie and would buy it again.",1399420800,2,1122,4.6
2061664,5,B000244GCW,"This movie was very interesting to watch and very educational about race relations at the time.  My friends and I watched it and we all found it to be a very good movie, not enjoyable because of the subject,  but very good and needs to be seen. My husband was in the military for twenty seven years and so I found this story very meaningful, sad but ends on a good note.",1397606400,,370,4.125

2061666,5,B000244GCW,"I wasn't sure I would like this movie at first, but as I got into it, I realized it was truly a superb film. As much heartbreaking as it was inspiring. Lithgow and Freeman are not disappointing in this film, and the supporting case give equally good performances. It's going to keep your emotions bending and turning as the story does.",1395273600,,335,4.508196721311475
2061667,5,B000244GCW,"I loved this movie.  The actors were fantastic, I couldn't hit the pause button at any stage through out this movie, I found it riveting viewing.  I do so enjoy such good movies and acting of the parts.  Fantastic",1393286400,,213,4.410256410256411
2061668,5,B000244GCW,"I liked this movie, because of the patriotism, and love of a brother, fallen, defending his country, as well as the folks at home. It depicts a time when racists clung to old hatreds, and biases, after laws had been passed by the Government, accepting the black race as American citizens, and being treated as such. The respect, and love shown by those who had overcome racism is heartwarming. The courage, and guts, they displayed, in behalf of this fallen hero, being able, to be laid to rest in a place of his parents choice, was gratifying to me.",1387497600,,550,4.565656565656566

2061670,5,B000244GCW,"This is unquestionably one of the finest films ever made.
I liked everything about it. It got everything right, which is near
impossible in the movie business. What I particularly liked about it
was the gear change when Major Laird insisted on getting to the bottom
of the black soldier's death. It went from provincial Southern discrimination
to prejudice on the battle field with disastrous results. They're themes that
mostly get treated heavy-handedly, but in Resting Place, the touch is deft.
I can't remember when a movie moved me as much as this one did. It should have
cleaned up at the Academy Awards, but very often films of this calibre don't
get favoured by the glitterati. This film shows how powerful the art of film can
be when masters of the art are in charge. Bravo.",1379376000,,783,4.7226277372262775

2061673,4,B000244GCW,"good movie,you have to watch this movie to understand how people can be today,and thier thought on the color of your skin even when they have died serving their country. watch the movie good acting.  Thanks L.Cusumano",1373414400,,217,4.864864864864865
2061674,4,B000244GCW,"Just a great story, Morgan Freeman didn't have as big a role as I expected though however he wasn't the star then as he is now.",1370390400,,127,3.923076923076923
2061675,3,B000244GCW,"I thought this was a telling movie how a group of people can discriminate just because of color.  I realize that the blacks were the target, and now the white's (especially Christians) are becoming the target in today's world.  With the illegals taking over our country, and other nationalities doing the same, goes to show that it can happen to anyone.  We are living in a time where injustice seems to be the norm.  No matter what your color or beliefs, it comes down to being wrong no matter who it embraces.  The government is working hard to pit one group against another to take the eye off of what they are doing in Washington, and it would behoove us to all keep that in mind and stop terrorizing any one group and focusing on what the powers that be are doing.  We all need to look at the character of the individual and not the outward appearance because there is evil and good in all races.  To stand up for what is right takes courage as this movie shows, and this is the message we must take away from this story.",1367625600,2,1026,4.3125
2061676,5,B000244GCW,"Hard to believe that this fine film is shoveled into one of those Echo Bridge collections of 13 movies for $7.99 at the local supermarket, but it is.

It recalls the racial tensions still alive in the early 70's, the agony of the Vietnam war and the effects of events on a platoon of soldiers through the fog of war. More than that revealed would be a spoiler.

The story unwinds slowly, perhaps too slowly for today's audience, but I found it riveting. The actors were well chosen, understated, and the plot, the story itself was the real star.

Nothing to offend children,so the whole family can watch.",1365206400,2,604,4.574074074074074
2061677,3,B000244GCW,"This movie plot was wonderful and true, but the acting of John Lithgow was a bit disappointing.  Morgan Freeman was great as always but his role was very limited.  After seeing it once, I doubt I will ever take it out of the cabinet and watch it again. I think the story could have been told much better by another actor.",1359676800,,321,4.245901639344262
2061678,4,B000244GCW,I loved 'the resting place' but didnot enjoy the terror as it was a young Jack nicholson and I lost nterest in it . I may try to view it again at a later date.,1359417600,,159,3.5714285714285716
2061679,4,B000244GCW,"This movie dealt with some of the struggles I went through as a child growing up in the south, after desegregation became the law of the land. I recall how I was told there were things that were simply not for me to aspire to do, and that I needed to remember ""my place"" in dealing with non-minority persons.
The primary, and more seasoned, characters/actors in the movie, clearly understood those times in our nation's history. However, though well acted, one could tell that the younger actors tried too hard sometimes to truly grasp America at that time.
All in all, it is a great movie, and one that still reflects some of the issues we are still dealing with in our multicultural America. I think everyone should see it.",1358294400,2,725,4.584615384615384
2061680,5,B000244GCW,"The story is well written and the acting can not be matched!  Morgan Freeman is fairly low-keyed in this movie, but I have never seen him do anything less than ""excellent""!",1355702400,,172,4.548387096774194
2061681,3,B000244GCW,"it's a movie that i'm glad i watched because of the actors, it has a twist in the plot that saves it from just another look at prejudice (which we, rightly, have been doing a lot of lately)",1354665600,,189,4.0
2061682,5,B000244GCW,John Lithgow and Morgan Freeman and the subject matter make this a must see movie. It is hard to believe that this could happen in America but ignorance has no boundries.,1349308800,,170,4.516129032258065
2061683,1,B000244GCW,I am huge Morgan Freeman fan and this movie really disappointed me.  This was definately not his caliber of story that he is usually associated with.,1333497600,,149,4.730769230769231
2061684,5,B000244GCW,"This was a story that tugged at my heart strings.  It is a serious story of racism and how a family is unable to bury their son who was killed in the war, in the city cemetery, because he was the wrong color.  The actors were excellent and they made you want to join the fight for right!",1331251200,,287,3.9310344827586206
2061685,4,B000244GCW,"This was a simple yet good movie.  All actors did real well.  I would've liked to have seen the ""answer"" told in a flashback so that we could see why his men were keeping quiet.  However it was still a good movie.",1328659200,,213,4.023809523809524
2061686,2,B000244GCW,"The movie was slow moving and tedious.  Fell asleep several times during the movie. As a matter of face, watched it with a couple friends and we all fell asleep at one point or another.  Wouldn't recommend it",1327881600,,208,4.447368421052632
2061697,5,B000244GCW,a wonderful story told very well.  One of my favorite videos. I saw it for the 1st time on Hallmark and tracked it down at Amazon.  Great acting.  Good story.  Happy ending.  Slight plot twist to keep it moving along.  Great CD.  John Alexander,1317254400,,244,4.409090909090909
2061698,3,B000244GCW,"This is a time piece movie dealing with segregated laws of the South and a failing hero family fighting for right to bury their War Hero son.  I was disappointed that Morgan Freedman part was very small, however there were turns and twist to the story that leads to great conversation with American history. It was a good movie.",1312416000,,328,4.559322033898305
2061699,5,B000244GCW,"I am a collector.  I collect many kinds of things.  One thing I collect is Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.  Let me begin this review by telling you NOWHERE is this fact noted!  There was a time when Hallmark movies were only broadcast & if a person missed its broadcast, well tough!  Other companies owned the rights of distribution.  I am grateful to report that is no longer the truth.  From at least year 2000, if you want to get a Hallmark movie, they can be ordered directly from Hallmark's web-site & sometimes, found in Hallmark retail stores.

Now, about the movie - I agree with the reviewers who cite the casting choices of John Lithgow, Morgan Freeman & CCH Pounder.  This movie is set in 1972.  I was in junior high school then!  I remember accounts of the war in Vietnam being broadcast on the evening news.  Racial discrimination was illegal by then.  Classrooms, even in the Deep-South were integrated, although many people didn't like it.  The police chief of this small town of Rockville, GA met the funeral party for LT Johnson at the entrance of the cemetary & would not let the casket be buried in the town cemetary, because, citing a law that said ""within the town boudaries of Rockville, only the remains or cremains of caucasians could be buried therin.""  Imagine the humiliation of the mourners to have to take the casket back to the church until the matter could be resolved!  Then, the character of Major Kendall Laird goes to work to try to get this man's body buried.  This fallen Lieutenant was an exceptional man his entire maturing life.  He got good grades in school & many other charitable deeds.  Then, he joined the Army & got sent to Vietnam to command a mostly white unit.  After he died, his unit put him up for a Silver Star.  Maj. Laird tries to sift through the stories of the men who served under Lt. Johnson.  I won't spoil the surprise event that changes the stroy-line for you.  Get the movie & watch it, especially if you are a fan of ""who-done-it"" & why.  There is real ""chemistry"" between the three main actors in this film.

Since this was a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, several things will remain constant & are true in this film as well.  First, it will start with a good story; and this is a good story.  It is a small slice of time (how long, I can't say, but the body lied in state in the church - maybe a course of a few days).  It is times to air in a 120 minute time slot - minus about 30-40 minutes for commercials.  Generally, casting included at least one well-known name; although there are some exceptions to this rule.  The sets will be realistic, and can be anywhere in the world.  There is little swearing, little blood-shed, little violence.  If the story requires these, the exposure will be at a bare minimum or addressed in dialog.  Many movies are made by the parent company of Hallmark Entertainment, but generally only three a year will earn the Hallmark Hall of Fame designation.  These are ""hallmarks"" of a great production.  I now own as much of the collection as is available in home-video formats of VHS & DVD.  Many are the ""Gold Crown Editions"".  (These have some special features that are not available in ""street copies"").  One of those special features is something they call ""The Making of ......"" featurette.  This is a smaller added feature that included some behind the scenes in shooting, interivews with the director, producer & cast as well as how the setting was chosen for outdoor shots.

This particular recording is what the Hallmark people call a ""street copy"".  It is just the movie.  You can go to particular scenes, but that is the only feature you can do with this version.  This recording is very clean.  I say this because it is generally my habit to set one of our VHS VCRs to record off-air, HHofF movies when they are broadcast.  Generally, at some point later, I will purchase the commercial version of the film.  Of course, that means I will get all the commercials too.  This movies oes seamlessly from scene to scene & the picture quality is very good.

Bottom line - would I recommend this film to others?  Oh YES!  Fefinately Yes!  It is my hope with more people viewing this film now, prejudice that happened in the 1970's will not continue occur in 2011 & beyond.",1309996800,,4277,4.525490196078431
2061700,5,B000244GCW,"This movie is an ultimate ""tear jerker"" and a great ""who done it?"" to boot. It is one of Morgan Freeman's earliest movies. He and John Lithgow were great in it. But they both played second ""fiddle"" to the awesome depth and poise displayed by the dead Black Vietnam hero soldier's mother (C.C.H. Pounder), as far as I'm concerned. This is now one of my all time favorite movies. /s/ Steve @ BibleProbe.com",1299024000,11,404,4.5479452054794525
