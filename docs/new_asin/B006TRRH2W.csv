8504074,3,B006TRRH2W,"Standard Zorro fare with the masked bandit stealing from the authorities. Of course, a young girl falls in love with the mysterious desperado. This version of the Zorro story is of mild interest with not enough action until the last fourth of the movie, when there is more action and a higher level of interest. If you enjoy adventure movies of the 30s and 40s, you will like this film. I prefer the 1998 Mask of Zorro with Banderas and Zeta-Jones.",1476662400,,448,4.54320987654321
