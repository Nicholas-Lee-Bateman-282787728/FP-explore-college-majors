4188412,5,B003SLEDGK,"We LOVE Laurie Berkner Band!  This DVD has all the great hits that we are used to seeing on Jack's Big Music Show and Nickelodeon.  Super catchy tunes, lots of dancing kids, great backgrounds and super-creative visually.  My daughter watches this one over and over and over... Makes a great gift, too!",1407715200,,301,4.75

4188415,5,B003SLEDGK,"Wow, from 10+ years of being a mom.... in my opinion? -There's Laurie Berkner, and then.... all other kids music in a distant second. Wow. Catchy nice, totally un-annoying, and non cloying songs and melodies, that kids from age 1-2 and up, just seem to love. My kids have literally been watching the ""We are the Laurie Berkener band"" their whole lives, (and loving it), and it's so nice to be able to add another DVD to our collection.
Laurie is the best. And she's just such a genuine, nice person too, that I think it just can't help but to come out in her songs too.
Go Laurie! Make more DVD's!
(Footnote, this is essentially the special that once originally aired on Noggin. Although I think it may be missing a song or two. Like the ""this is me and family"" song. I don't know, (while I certainly didn't,)  ...I suppose maybe some people might have found their ideas of one or two of the family units that flashed by during the song controversial..) But anyhow, while I miss the song, in short- -it's another a great Laurie Berkener collection!",1399593600,,1048,4.486910994764398

4188427,5,B003SLEDGK,"I recorded this from Nick Jr. when my oldest was a toddler and she watched it forever. I knew my youngest would love it so I searched and ordered it. He LOVES it, and my 6 yr-old is having fun singing the songs again! Great kids songs to sing along with!",1397433600,,254,4.0
4188428,1,B003SLEDGK,This DVD is extremely poor quality and we do not even use it. It seems like it's a pirate copy. I think the content of the video is probably great but the quality is extremely poor.,1396569600,,181,4.055555555555555
4188429,5,B003SLEDGK,"Laurie Berkner is AMAZING!  She turns my 3year old into a frenzied, dancing, drooling zombie. If I ever need a 35 minute break, this is a guarantee!!",1395878400,,149,4.518518518518518
4188430,5,B003SLEDGK,"our son used to watch Noggin and loved ""Jack's Big Music Show"" where Laurie was a regular. Unfortunately Noggin got canned and we never watched Nick Jr. (We don't want the commercials). Now that we have another little one we wanted to have some nice tunes to dance to. This is it! our 7 year old remembers the songs and now makes up his own lyrics to the tunes to amuse his little brother :-) Good times for everyone. You too will find these songs stuck in your head!",1395705600,,467,4.258426966292135

4188432,5,B003SLEDGK,This is a great video with lots of our favorite Laurie songs. It's also pretty cool that the dvd starts over on its own (making it great background music for a birthday party).,1395187200,,176,4.363636363636363
4188433,5,B003SLEDGK,My son loves Laurie Berkner! People mention the cartoon skits between songs but my son doesn't mind those and they aren't very long. I thought they were between every song but they play 2 to 3 songs before the cartoon skits come on. He loves it and dancing along. Well worth the money!,1395100800,,285,4.39622641509434
4188434,5,B003SLEDGK,"My daughter is 15 months old and not into watching a lot of TV, but she LOVES Laurie Berkner! The music is catchy and doesn't give me a headache. We took this on a plane ride with us also and it was the only thing that caught her attention on our 3 hour flight.",1393632000,,261,3.8518518518518516
4188435,5,B003SLEDGK,"My little girl LOVES LB.  She has been listening to Laurie since she was born and now, at 2.5 years old, still asks for Laurie daily.  I like the songs because they are fun, upbeat, and involve real musical instruments as well as real children.  Great content including environmental stimuli/sounds and vocabulary words.  I recommend Laurie to everyone I know with kids. A+++",1392076800,,375,4.904761904761905

4188437,1,B003SLEDGK,I bought this based on others reviews. My kids won't even stay in the room when I put it in. Very annoying...ugghh! Maybe we'll try again another day...or year.,1388534400,,160,4.551724137931035
4188438,5,B003SLEDGK,Love her music.  My grandson loves her and so do I.  I bought a copy to have at my house after seeing it at my grandson's house.  She is very positive and her tunes are very catchy.  She has lots of variety.  Wish she had more DVD/CD combos.,1387929600,,241,3.9375
4188439,4,B003SLEDGK,"I'm not a big fan of the cartoon format; however, my grandkids love this dvd.  Laurie's music is always great.....catchy tunes with great imagination and even a lesson or two.  Great buy.",1387065600,,187,4.8125

4188443,5,B003SLEDGK,"This DVD is all music and I love that!!! I am a huge music lover but to be honest, kid music usually annoys me...not Laurie Berkner. Her songs are so catchy. My 1 1/2 year old will literally sit and watch the entire video. He has even picked up on some of the songs and can act out what they are doing in the video. Every few songs, Moose and Zee will come on and teach something about music, like what Encore means or how to keep a beat by clapping your hands. I have read some of the other reviews and I know that some people were disappointed in the songs that were on the DVD. I guess the ones that were expected to be on it were not. I don't have cable so I didn't know anything about the Laurie Berkner band until I saw it on in a doctors office and it caught my attention. I can tell that some of the songs are older and some are newer by the way the band looks but all in all I think it's great....more importantly, so does my son!",1384387200,,939,3.9214659685863875

4188445,5,B003SLEDGK,It's Laurie Berkner...she's great!  Small people LOVE her and she doesn't get on my nerves because she can actually sing and play music!  Her songs tell stories and are just silly enough to be fun.  WIN!!,1379894400,,204,4.611111111111111
4188446,5,B003SLEDGK,"My daughter has loved Laurie Berkner since she was about 10 months old. She's now 22 months and now she sings and dances a long. Sometimes when she's in an absolute meltdown, we play this and she cheers up right away! We only had one other dvd and it was great to get this one with some new songs and more variety. For any young child that loves music (probably best for ages 1-4), I'd highly recommend this. Plus, the music isn't nearly as annoying as lots of songs made just for kids. In fact, some of them are kind of catchy!",1379203200,,528,4.186274509803922
4188447,5,B003SLEDGK,She is. the best ever!!  My granddaughters love love love her!  And they know all the songs.  Would recommend this cd to anyone.  Great value!,1379030400,,142,4.56
4188448,5,B003SLEDGK,"He's 3 now, but man this video has been played so much in my house.  More so when my son was 1.5 years old to 2, but still he still asks for occasionally.  Great for small kids!  And her music doesn't drive me or my husband insane - so bonus!",1378944000,,242,3.8

4188450,4,B003SLEDGK,My 18 month old watches it daily and it captivates him. The only thing I don't like is the in between song parts--they are really annoying!! Laurie's songs are great though. This vid is better than her previous one I think.,1375833600,,223,4.463414634146342

4188453,5,B003SLEDGK,My son absolutely loves this DVD.  We started putting it on for him when he was about 3 months old.  We sing and dance to the music together and he giggles and squeals the whole time.  The songs are great and the video features lots of bright colors and little children which really grab my son's attention.  It's the perfect distraction during his fussy period in the evening.  My husband and I love spending the quality time with him singing and dancing and laughing.  Caution:  These songs are very catchy... You will end up singing these songs to yourself even when your child is not around!  :),1372636800,,599,4.5327102803738315

4188455,5,B003SLEDGK,"My girls (2 and 3 1/2 years old) both love this DVD.  We watch it probably twice a week and they love to dance and sing to every song.  The video quality is better on some songs than others.  However, considering the age of their target audience, I don't consider this an issue.  The girls are always excited when it's Laurie Berkner time and we have a great time dancing and goofing around as a family.",1370304000,,403,4.2631578947368425
4188456,5,B003SLEDGK,"My 2.5 year old toddler saw a Laurie Berkner song in a mid clip on Nick Jr and instantly fell in love so when she asked for more I immediately began searching for a dvd that included the song she had originally seen ( 5 days old). This is her most requested video when she gets tv time because not only is it fun and colorful but the music is bouncy and great to move around with. My daughter doesn't sit still and watch she jumps, dances and has an active time all while singing along to her favorites. The in-between  clips with Moose and Zee are an added plus since they were taken off the air.
I can't wait to search for more from Laurie Berkner!",1370131200,,650,4.118110236220472

4188460,5,B003SLEDGK,We tried several of the LB movies from the library before purchasing. This is the one that my very particular daughter fell in love with. It features moose and zee from the noggin days and is primarily songs without a lot of stopping and talking. The songs are very fun and my daughter really gets into them. She asks to watch this one all the time and it's the least annoying of all of her favorite kids' songs movies. I'd even go so far as to say that I enjoyed it the first 12 times :),1368662400,,488,4.09375
4188461,5,B003SLEDGK,My 4 year old loved the music and especially loved seeing his old friends Moose and Zee! Nick should have really released a full Moose and Zee DVD.,1363392000,,147,4.285714285714286

The first one I thought maybe my daughter had sctrached it, the second one I thought again, we had damaged it, but this time I put it in the player directly from the newly unwrapped box.... it doesnt work properly.  It skips in the same places the previous ones did. Do I just have terrible luck or is there something wrong with the production of these dvds?  I'm so disapointed.  My daughter loves the other Laurie Berkner dvds.  Shes watched Party Day a million times.  This is so frustrating!!  I cant return the item, because I live in Italy and it would cost more to ship it back than its worth.... what do I do?",1361750400,,693,4.244274809160306

I turn the DVD on and he stops whatever he's doing, runs over, and stares at the tv. He's finally starting to mimic her in the songs like he'll move his legs really fast and clap. It's super cute and I like the music myself.",1360022400,,391,4.0256410256410255

4188469,5,B003SLEDGK,"My daughter has been listening to Laurie since she was about 15 months old and is a fanatic about her music.
The lyrics are fun and interesting and the videos are colorful and fun as well.  We like that it shows other kids dancing and running around in the videos cause it makes my daughter want to join in.  She is now 20 months old and speaks very well - she has memorized many of the songs, she has learned how to clap a beat, she can listen to the instructions to put her hands on her nose or jump in the air, it's really a great activity and encourages music appreciation.  This particular DVD is great because it is very long with maybe 20 some songs as opposed to some others with only 8 songs.",1359590400,,701,4.139705882352941

I would prefer her watch this than cartoons on TV as it also encourage her to sing & dance along.",1359417600,,401,4.2368421052631575

4188474,5,B003SLEDGK,"My four kids (ages 1 - 5) LOVE this DVD and so do I. Although, I've never watched it--I've only listened to it while they watch it in the back of the SUV--so I can't comment on production quality. But every one of the songs is catchy and sweet and anyone who gave the DVD 3 stars was just upset that the DVD did not include the song ""Family"" but it does not claim to do so. It does include ""I'm Me and You're You"", which I thought was a great but hard-to-find song of Laurie's so we were pleased that it was on the DVD. But you will love all of the songs and ""Rocketship Run"" will make up for whatever songs you are missing. I can NOT get that song out of my head and my kids go CRAZY when they know it's about to play. And for 5 bucks, how can you go wrong with this DVD?!?",1357689600,,774,3.84375

4188479,5,B003SLEDGK,"I'm not sure why Nick Jr made all the changes they did this past spring. With those changes they got rid of Moose and Zee who were favorites on the channels for my oldest child well, since she was old enough to watch cartoons. When they got rid of these guys they also booted the ""Let's move to the music"" and that took a lot of the songs my kids loved as well as Laurie Berkner off their radar. I bought this for my 3 year old because ever time one of her songs would come on she would get super excited. This is about 43 minutes long and features several of her best loved songs. My kids love it and we even get to see Moose and Zee again.",1356825600,,641,3.9384615384615387

4188487,5,B003SLEDGK,"I can't believe this DVD is only $5!

This DVD is songs that Laurie Berkner did for Nick Jr. It includes all you and your child's favorite songs. My only wish is that it had Family, which we love and have yet to find on a CD, either. One thing that you may find annoying is that each song is introduced by Moose A Moose. Some people like it, some people don't, it's up to you.

One thing that's almost guaranteed is that you child will sing, dance and clap along with these lively and fun songs.

It's great!! It has plenty of spots with them between songs and included in the special features are four videos with fun cartoons of just Moose and Zee. It was perfect and my daughter loved being able to see her favorite two characters again. Also, we have already memorized the Laurie songs that are catchy and fun to dance around to.

When I discovered The Laurie Berkner Band and purchased my first dvd, my little ones were elated!  In 24 years I can honestly say that only a few video's/dvd's have captivated the children I have cared for so much, and these dvd's do just that.  The Children will clean up the toys extra fast when they know that the reward is watching the Laurie Berkner Band!  They dance, jump up and down and sing along joyfully when watching these!  I highly recommend this band's dvd's.  The seller was great and the item arrived quickly!",1303516800,,612,4.568807339449541

My daughter loves 'Whose That?' she always sings that part when we are driving around. I love singing along with my daughter as well. The moose & zee interludes are great too. Highly recommend this DVD!,1302998400,,345,4.323076923076923
4188505,5,B003SLEDGK,Our kids love watching this DVD and dancing along. Its only fault is the cartoon interludes between some songs. Our 22 month old thinks we have changed the channel and starts pushing buttons on the remote when the cartoons come on.,1302912000,,231,4.658536585365853
4188508,5,B003SLEDGK,"This DVD has taught me that there IS such a thing as kids' music that is a) excellent musically [well composed, engaging, creative, good instrumentation & voices, catchy tunes], b) non-condescending to kids and their parents, and c) is enjoyable and catchy for the whole family. I had shied away from ""kids' music"" for my children because I associated childrens' music with corny, cheesy, condescending music I would never want to listen to. But this DVD is the opposite. I get these songs stuck in my head all the time and it really doesn't bother me - I enjoy them! Our whole family is always singing Laurie Berkner's songs. The other nice thing is that the DVD is much more developmentally appropriate for toddlers and preschoolers than most TV programming is. With some TV shows my 2 year old stands 2 inches from the TV staring like a zombie. It's creepy, and makes me majorly limit his TV. This DVD, on the other hand, encourages him to DANCE! He is excited when we turn it on, but he wants to dance and sing rather than stand or sit like a zombie. The images are just kids wearing fun costumes and dancing and doing funny things, or the band playing - Colorful and engaging, but appropriate for an age range where your kid really SHOULDN'T be sitting still and watching TV silently. Two thumbs up, Laurie Berkner!",1297555200,,1320,4.5974576271186445

Many of the videos are from Jack's Big Music Show, and others we hadn't seen before, which was nice.  We also love the intermixing of Moose between the songs...

4188516,4,B003SLEDGK,"My little girl just got this for Christmas, and the first time she watched it she got upset every time Moose and Zee came on.  Moose and Zee come on between every song segment and she didn't like it. She would start yelling ""Laurie Berkner"".  I think people who order this are ordering it to get Laurie Berkner, not Nick Jr.

I also didn't realize it was going to have songs from her last DVD on it as well.  I thought it would be all new songs. But overall, I think my little girl will enjoy watching it (once she gets used to this format), and I definitely don't mind listening to it in the car (especially compared to some of her DVD's).",1293408000,2,640,4.178861788617886

4188518,4,B003SLEDGK,"We got the Laurie Berkner DVD right after we saw the ad for it on Nick Jr.
My daughter (10 months) would stop whatever she was doing to watch some of the videos on Nick like ""Who's That?"" and ""5 years old"". So once we saw they were making a DVD we jumped on it.
And sure enough she loves it. With the exception of 1 or 2 songs all of the songs on this DVD are fun and some are just silly. Lauries music is constantly encouraging the kids to participate. My daughter knows when to clap and even make the Octopus sound during the ""Pig on your head"" song.
Most of the songs even my wife and I like with the exception of the ""Clouds"" song and ""On the farm"".
The Moose and Zee interludes are kinda cheesy and my daughter seems to loose attention during them after she's watched the DVD a few times. But the Moose and Zee songs include a couple that she really likes like ""Everywhere I go"".

Here's a list of the songs you'll find (not sure of the names);
5 Days Old
Cat Came Back
In the Clouds (probably my daughter and I's least favorite on the disc)
I'm a Mess
I'm me and you're you
I'm not perfect
I Really Love to Dance
Magic Box
My Energy
On the Farm
Pig On Her Head
Rocket Ship Run
Fast and Slow
Sneaks
Victor Vito
Who's That

From Moose and Zee you'll get;
Everywhere I go
Music Makes Me
Were Goin On A Trip
Word of Wonder

The production value varies but is usually pretty good don't expect High Def or anything but it's nice and clear, there's some interlacing so if you have a newer TV with progressive scan you'll notice it but I really doubt it will make a difference to your kids.
Most of the videos feature little kids running around dancing, singing, clapping and having fun which catches and holds my daughters attention. Seeing the little kids do things seems to also help encourage her to mimic them and participate in the song and dance.

I really only have one gripe and bear with me here. This DVD has an insane amount of copy protection. For most folks that won't be a big deal, but we like to rip our movies to our media PC and stash the DVD's so they don't get ruined. One benefit to this is instant access and another is that if the songs are ripped separately you can make a playlist and only play the songs you like. You can also easily bring the movies along on a laptop or back them up to an external pocket drive and watch them at grandma's without toting a box full of DVD's. We do this for my daughter with movies, music etc. It's a lot like ripping music to your ipod, but instead your just putting your movies on your media drive.
However this DVD was so protected that it took me over a week before I could finally find an application that would let me get it on my computer.
Now I understand copy protection but it was a bit ridiculous, especially for some kids songs. In the DVD player I also couldn't bypass the 10 minutes of advertisements which was incredibly annoying.
So it loses 1 star for that but based on my daughters reaction I'd have to say I recommend getting this DVD, it's a lot of fun.
My wife and I sing the songs to her now when we're in the car and she claps when appropriate and of course makes the octopus sound... it's pretty darn cute.",1290729600,32,3189,4.172077922077922

4188523,4,B003SLEDGK,"This DVD is not awful, but it is vastly inferior to ""We are... The Laurie Berkner Band"".  In that one, they draw from over a decade of songs that Laurie wrote.  We Are... also seems better produced and directed.  As an example, the lighting was much better in the first DVD.  In the new one, Laurie is blasted with high intensity lights, so much so that her face appears overexposed and white and her eyes a little too dramatic (guess that's the style today though).  Musically I prefer the first one too.

This DVD also suffers from interludes with the Nick Jr. moose where he does silly things to hype the crowd.  This gets old fast, and kills replay value.

Her early DVD I have literally watched a hundred times and still enjoy.  We even went to see the band in concert.  They are great.

I still give this DVD four stars because it's above average compared to other childrens' DVDs.",1287705600,17,887,4.447204968944099

The songs on this disc are some of our favorites, and we were so happy the 'fast and slow' was included.  My only minor complaint is that since Nicolodean produced it, you have some annoying character skits included and previews to skip.  I liked her first DVD a little better because it's only her music and nothing else!  But I'm happy with this DVD, my 16 month old loves it, and I like that it doesn't have too many repeats from her other DVD.",1286236800,2,539,4.525773195876289
