8398081,5,B003JDVCVG,Excellent movie with great acting by lead characters. It portrays the story in a realistic manner-- no one is portrayed as being able to deal with the illness in a perfect manner but their love for each other comes through. Very underated movie. Won awards.  Sad but sweet.,1500854400,,273,4.6875
8398082,3,B003JDVCVG,"From watching other Korean movies, it seems that this story is extremely rare if it ever happens in Korea, not to mention if it can happen in USA or Hong Kong.  The movie depicted a girl who started dating a guy in a wheelchair, who has the incurable Lou Gehrig's disease.  They both knew he would get worse and worse, eventually not able to move even his feet and arms and die.  But she persisted, maybe because she works for a funeral home and prepare the people who passed away for burial or cremation.  Her father lost his legs, so maybe that's why she has sympathy for people who has disability.

Still, what is in the movie is extremely rare nowadays.  I almost feel like the story happened on another planet, or it might happen 30, 40 years ago, but not nowadays.

Nowadays, girls will ask what you do for a job, and if you graduated from MIT and is just a software engineer, she will just rule you out.  But if you are rich, or if you are a director or vice president, then she will feel that it is worth her while.  Some girls I know, they would rather date a gangster or a guy who used to steal credit card numbers, because those guys represent power, money, and protection.  For a girl nowadays to date a guy in a wheelchair and even change his nappy, that's extremely rare -- especially the actress is a model grade and movie star grade person.  She can easily be a 8.5 or 9.  Girls nowadays, even if they are a 5 or 6, can date a guy who is rich, or even when they are 38 years old, can date a guy who is 55 and have a lot of money and ready to retire and spend money every day.  This is happening in the San Francisco Bay Area in the Silicon Valley.  Or the girls in Hong Kong, they always say they want to find a guy with honesty and integrity, and they all end up marrying a rich guy.  For an actress like that to go through what happened in this story, it is just too unbelievable -- almost like a movie for another planet.

San Francisco newspaper movie critic actually has a term for this kind of movie: they will call it a ""feel good"" movie, instead of a movie that depicts a good story of the society or just ""drama"".  I was quite shocked a few years ago when I heard of this term ""feel good"" movie, but now find it more and more so -- the movie might in fact make you feel good, feel that the world is full of a lot of warmth.  But as the category says, it is supposed to make you ""feel good"".",1324684800,,2415,4.080508474576271
