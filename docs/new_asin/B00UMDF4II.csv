We gave it a chance and realized that things aren't always as they seem (which applies to the plot as well). I found the acting to be compelling and would definitely watch another episode. Quite often I won't make it past the first 10 minutes of a new show, but this held my interest and left me wanting to watch more.",1460937600,19,432,4.4125

She has broken everybody's lives around her only to get her revenge. I had an impression that the Gemma herself just a psychotic patient who stopped taking her medications and got acute psych.episode....",1520208000,,545,5.578313253012048

7053404,5,B00UMDF4II,"Doctor Foster is a 2016 three-episode British mystery and family drama series, which was initially broadcast on the BBC One Network. Its story line centers around a successful and highly-regarded family physician, who seems to have the perfect life, as evidenced by her great career, her adoring husband, her wonderful young son, and her beautiful home. However, early in the first episode, she makes several observations about the rather questionable recent behavior of her husband, which lead her to suspect that he may be carrying on an affair. She subsequently investigates these disparate pieces of evidence, and then embarks on a very dark and destructive pathway, which results in the complete unraveling of her previously idyllic life. Doctor Foster is a study in overwhelming obsession and vindictiveness, and the absolute ruination that typically results from this type of deranged behavior. While Doctor Foster certainly features excellent acting performances, some viewers might consider its plot to be a bit over-the-top. However, I found Doctor Foster to be very engaging and entertaining, and I give it a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1503187200,5,1180,5.489010989010989
7053405,1,B00UMDF4II,"... this is hackneyed and melodramatic from start to finish. It's almost as though the bold, slightly absurd quality that makes Bartlett's drama great is what handicaps Doctor Foster. The performances of the cast are a bit uneven and, though Suranne Jones does a decent job, and there are several impressive supporting performances (notably Victoria Hamilton), Bertie Carvel - who has an Olivier Award - is truly dreadful. He somehow manages to be massively OTT and boring/wooden at the same time: something that really shouldn't be possible for an actor not in a soap.

Such a shame, it has all the ingredients of a hit, with the first episode setup promising much. Do yourself a favour, and go to see just about any one of Bartlett's stage plays instead. The best moments of Doctor Foster are worse than anything of his I've seen on stage.",1496361600,,841,4.8

7053519,5,B00UMDF4II,"I first saw this on Lifetime TV and DVR'd it. I had to clean up the DVR recently to make room so I took the plunge and purchased the series on Prime and just re-watched it this weekend. It's a little bit high in price for a digital video, but it's so good, it's worth every penny.

The story, written by a man, no less, is so clever and so smart, I am amazed every time I view it.

The story begins so simply, with Gemma Foster, M.D. finding a long blonde hair on a scarf she has borrowed from her husband. The blonde hair sets off a lightbulb in Gemma's head, consuming her. Such a small thing but when you look at it more deeply, there must have been some unacknowledged intuition at play. In any case, the suspicion consumes her. All encompassing. That single strand of blonde hair catalyzes her and one thing leads to another to another to another, revealing a complex web of deceit perpetrated by not only her husband, her work colleagues, friends, neighbors, patients and on and on and on. Even her son begins to turn on her.

The thing that really infuriates me is how everyone is complicit behind Gemma's back. Her co-workers are tipping the husband to her whereabouts, the neighbors, on the one hand, won't get involved in another couple's marriage but take the time to socialize with Gemma's cheating husband and his 23-year old girlfriend. When you view this more than once, you realize the extreme sexism present in the scenario (which, sadly, is based in reality). In her quest to find the truth, everyone is working on behalf of Simon, the cheating spouse and against her. She is accused of killing his mother by assisting in her suicide, she is accused of always being able to do/say the things that hurt people (when she is the victim), because she loves her work, has worked hard and excels at it, she is ridiculed even though she has supported her incompetent husband in his failing business dealings. Without telling her, he liquidates all of their assets, forges her name on mortgage documents and steals their son's college fund (the inheritance she received from her parents untimely death when she was 16) without a word to her. Even when he bankrupts the family, he is still defended.

I really get angry, every time I watch this (even though I know the outcome) about the ""pass"" Simon seems to get at every turn and the blame Gemma seems to get from everyone in every corner of her life, even from her son, whom she loves and it trying to protect. But, as Gemma's entire life is crumbling around her, she pulls it together and deals with it to her benefit once she starts playing the hand she has been dealt with precision and clarity.

This film highlights the double standard there is in relationships and how women are held to a different standard. It's a brilliant and extremely insightful.

If you like British cinema/TV, this is a must see  there are no slow moments, it's filled with surprises and the end is VERY satisfying.

Recommend.",1475539200,2,2969,4.567669172932331
7053520,2,B00UMDF4II,"Like most women, the idea of a man cheating on me, (and it has happened) is absolutely nauseating and the idea of revenge very sweet. So it's amazing that a series about a woman getting revenge on her unfaithful husband had me, in the end, rooting for HIM. When he makes his little speech about people being animals at the mercy of their biology, and tells her that it happens all the time, all over the world, I found myself wanting her to listen. Because she doesn't just destroy him. She destroys everybody. Most of all, and unforgivably, she destroys her son and his relationship with his father. He will have no chance at a normal upbringing after her stunts. I wish she would have just slept with other people and got a lot of money, and left it at that. What a psycho.",1474848000,7,775,4.388888888888889

Dr. Foster's outrageous behavior is is self destructive yet the outcomes are incongruent. Overly dramatized and somewhat unrealistic.

I kept thinking that ""Doctor Foster"" was so bad that it could have been a Lifetime production....then read that it was actually shown on Lifetime; that says it all. The script was poorly written and the directing faulty.

It was written playwright Mike Bartlett . .I am amazed and have renewed faith in at least a small portion of the male population. In fact, I would love to meet Mr. Bartlett and buy him dinner.

7053591,5,B00UMDF4II,"We already loved Suranne Jones from her role in ""Smith & Bailey"" (or ""Janet and Rachel"" as my wife and I call it).  The acting in ""Dr. Foster"" is equally excellent throughout. The story is intriguing, suspenseful, and memorable. We have watched all episodes two times and are beginning on our third viewing.

I solved the mystery of the ""missing episodes."" I was perplexed because the original description of the series said that it contains five episodes. We bought an Amazon Video Season Pass, and loved the first three episodes -- but then we couldn't find Episodes 4 and 5. This was also strange because the end of ""Episode 3"" seemed to be the logical place to end the season -- dramatically, it was, well, the end.  So we bought the DVD, which had ""all five"" episodes. As it turns out, there is no discrepancy here. On Amazon Instant, the story was presented as 3 90-minute episodes. On the DVD, it was presented as 5 55-minute (approximately) episodes. It is exactly the same material: roughly 270 minutes total. They just split it up differently for presentation. But no matter how you slice it, it's a great show, and I'm glad we own the DVD.

(P.S., We also own the complete collection of ""Smith and Bailey"" seasons, which we have also watched several times already.)",1463616000,18,1276,4.683035714285714

7053593,4,B00UMDF4II,"I caught this when broadcast on Lifetime.  It's hard to rate. It is a well made British drama. And as much as I hate to say it, British TV on average tends towards being a cut above US TV since the Brits don't seem to mind making the audience think a little. In the case of this story, that is both a plus and a negative. On the one hand, you can't wait to see what happens next. On the other hand, the main character - the woman scorned - is hard to root for.  While her anger and hurt are understandable, the ways she goes about seeking her revenge makes her seem less justified and more plain old unstable.

8707494,3,B00UMDF4II,"There's some very solid acting in this series, but the central premise is rather difficult to tolerate, namely that every adult in the frame has an emotional age of four. Consequently they act irrationally, have no self-control, are prone to tantrums and fits of hysteria, and in general are a menace to themselves and everyone around them. So if you like histrionic melodrama, this is the nearest thing to a South American telenovela and as such has a certain hypnotic curiosity, much akin to watching a slow-motion train wreck.
