8198798,5,B000R4FWQG,I enjoyed this DVD.  Earlier reviews said the video quality was less than professional but I thought the quality was fine.  Her skin is so healthy looking for a woman her age.  I hope this helps me get on track incorporating more raw foods into my diet!  I definitely do feel better when I eat this way.,1270944000,2,303,4.2631578947368425
8198799,4,B000R4FWQG,"I have purchased about 7 raw food DVDs.  My top picks are Raw Food Made Easy by Jenny Cornbleet and Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen.  Both are currently available through Amazon with a coordinating cook book.  That being said, this is a good runner up to those.  It is a bit more basic and a tad less comprehensive than Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen which includes a few more complicated recipes.  Like the others it is basically a demonstration video, a taping of a class.  One advantage of this video is that she covers making nut milks and juicing with only a Vita Mix and nut milk bag.  (I have done this and it works better than my $300 juicer)  She also makes pate and mashed potatoes and desserts.  She has an accent but is easy to understand, regardless.  (As stated  by another reviewer) the video is not a hollywood production, but in my opinion that does not take much away from its value.  The other videos are better visual quality.  Hoever this one is clear enough to see her demos.  I would recommend this to new Raw Foodists.  I think the information in here is probably repetative to seasoned Raw Foodist.",1259193600,9,1132,4.427184466019417
8198800,5,B000R4FWQG,"After doing 3 years of research and trying to keep up with techniques and equipment, I sometimes get overwhelmed by the raw food world. This video took me back to basics and boosted my confidence. I was reminded that raw foods can be easy and fast. Victoria's 5 flavor formula makes everything simple and delicious! Now, if I get exhausted by my raw food gourmet ""cookbook"", I just put in this dvd and get back on track.",1253145600,3,420,4.467532467532467
8198801,2,B000R4FWQG,The info was good but the presentation poor.  Looks like an old style home made video.,1252540800,3,86,4.375
8198802,5,B000R4FWQG,I found this DVD to be packed with information and detailed how to make some really great raw food dishes.  It is great for the new raw foodist.  I really enjoyed Victoria's humor.  A great addition to your  raw food library.,1205366400,6,225,4.414634146341464
8198803,5,B000R4FWQG,"Victoria Boutenko's DVD, ""Raw Gourmet Dishes Simplified"" is very helpful to a beginning raw foodist.
Many basic recipes are demonstrated in detail, with variations discussed: nut milk, green juice without a juicer, soup, pasta and sauce, mashed potatoes, garden burger, and a beautiful and fairly complex cake; plus spoken directions for a simple cracker and how to vary it.

Victoria is generous with her many years of experience preparing raw dishes and her inimitable humor is sprinkled throughout. I notice she has recently lowered the price as well!",1205280000,15,554,5.295454545454546
8198804,5,B000R4FWQG,"As a new rawfoodist, I was confused as to what to eat and how to prepare meals.  This DVD provide clear and easy to follow instruction on meal preparation - it took the guesswork out of meal preparation.  Whether you are a new or seasoned rawfoodist or you simply want to experiment with raw foods, you will find this DVD very valuable.  Special thanks to the author for sharing her wisdom and skills with the world.",1193961600,16,416,4.447368421052632
