8694665,5,B00R9O4ZWY,"This show is actually a spin off for Zettai Karen Children (or also known as Psychic Squad), but you can watch it on its own with clear understanding. The premise of this show is similar to X-men since it is about the struggles of a society where people with powers, or espers, are often feared by normal humans. The main character, Hyoubu Kyousuke, is actually the main protagonist in the original series. He is the leader of PANDRA, which is similar in a way to the Brotherhood of Mutants in X-men. He can be seen as an anit-hero similar to Magneto since while his methods are rouge, he is a character that can be sympathized with due to his experiences similarly with Magneto.",1534550400,,679,4.528455284552845

8694667,4,B00R9O4ZWY,"Not a bad show. It's a spin off of another anime (which I suddenly can't remember). The main character is the antagonist in the original series. It's quick, so you don't get to go in-depth with many of the characters, but if you want action, comedy and drama it's pretty good.",1458086400,,276,4.431372549019608

""You don't need psychic powers to know Hyobu Kyosuke is trouble waiting to happen, but having psychic powers of your own may be your only chance if you want to stand against him. One of the most powerful espers on the planet, Hyobu's incredible range of abilities extends as far as controlling his own aging process, and the potential strength of all his talents combined is so terrifying that he wears a device that limits their use except in cases of extreme emergency. The time is coming, however, when Hyobu will need to unleash everythhing he has. Because sometimes it takes a villain to do what heroes can't, and as leader of the secret organization P.A.N.D.R.A., Hyobu's dedicated his life to fighting those who would entrap, enslave or kill anyone with psychic powers. Now P.A.N.D.R.A. itself is in danger and to combat that deadly threat, the gloves and limiter are coming off! The dark side of the world of PSYCHIC SQUAD is unveiled in an incredible new series, where the lines between good and the bad cease to exsist and the only goal is survival in UNLIMITED PSYCHIC SQUAD!""

First let me tell you a bit of history. This series is a spin-off of Zettai Karen Children, which is known as Psychic Squad in America. This series is Courtesy of Zettai Karen Children - The Unlimited - Hyobu Kyosuke, known as Unlimited Psychic Squad in America. This spin-off stars Hyobu Kyosuke, the main antagonist of Zettai Karen Children. This series is very dark and serious, and doesn't have the same humor from the original series.

This DVD contains 3 discs and all 12 episodes, this is good if you like short animes. The animation is nice and smooth. It's very nice to look at, though Hyobu's eyes looked too big in Episode 9, but that's just me.

The soundtrack is very epic and very nice. The voices are really good, however, there is no English Dub, it's subbed. The problem with the subs is, there's no option to turn the subs on in the main menu, you have to turn them on by watching an episode.

One of my friends said that she didn't like how the ending kept changing. This is true, there are 8 ending themes in the series, but 2 opening themes. One opening theme is in English and one is in Japanese. She also said that the English title Unlimited Psychic Squad, sounded like a kids show while the show is not. She also said that they didn't develop on some things very well. There's lots of action and fighting and they are enjoyable to watch! I want this review to be short, so here's my pros and cons:

Pros

Great series!

Short anime(If you like short anime!)

Smooth animation

Fun action and fight scenes

Beautiful and epic soundtrack

Great voices

Cons

English title(Unlimited Psychic Squad) sounds like a kids show

Some things aren't well-developed

No English Dub(Sorry Dub Lovers!)

Subtitles have to be turned on while watching

Now, should you buy this? Yes! You should! This series is awesome and I recommend you pick it up! Go tell your friends! Well... What should I do for last? Oh yes!

8694669,4,B00R9O4ZWY,"Kyosuke Hyobu is the leader of the secret ESPers organization PANDORA. The organization is dedicated to fighting those who would entrap, enslave, or kill ESPers. Sometimes their methods are a little questionable.

Hyobu reminds me a lot of Magneto (X-Men). He is dedicated to the protection of his kind, but a little less than considerate for normal humans. As he is the central character of the series, you tend to sympathize with him more than not, even as you recognize that his ideas are flawed (speaking as normal human that is).

This series is a spinoff of a show called 'Psychic Squad' ( Zettai Karen Children), which I had never heard of, much less seen before watching this show. As far as I can tell, this series takes place either in the middle or towards the end of the original series (at least, in this series the kids are in their early teens instead of being 10). The main characters for the original show show up briefly, but this series is really dedicated to their enemy, Hyobu.

I was able to follow along with the series just fine without having seen the original show. I was a little confused when the girls showed up, but I could still understand their role as opponents of PANDORA.

I think Hyobu was a interesting character and he straddled the line between good and bad guy really well. His backstory was well done too. There were things I didn't particularly like about this series (some of the characters were annoying and the plot not terribly strong at points), but I really liked Hyobu and thus found the series an entertaining experience.",1429488000,5,1571,4.6606498194945845
