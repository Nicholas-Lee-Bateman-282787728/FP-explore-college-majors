I'm not into prying into the private lives of the artists who's works I admire, but I am very interested in their work environments, processes and theories. This film provides a look into the creative substance by overlaying content with comment. It works enough for me to give it a 5, but it does leave me wanting more.

His book, 'A Year With Swollen Apendices' provides quite a bit more, but as a video/audio professional, I long for more emmersive biographical content like this and Picasso's film of painting on Glass.",1106179200,,660,4.730434782608696
7848893,5,6303504159,"Yeah, some people will dig this and some people won't...  It's slow, ethereal, occasionally drifting and occasionally stirring...  If you can lean back and let a sensual experience fill your senses, then you will enjoy this mightily.  If you require more content and substance, it won't be so much your thing.

The Eno interview footage is regrettable sparse (though the limited amount of it is very enlightening, and the ""punch line"" at the end is quietly hilarious), but the sensual content is extraordinary, so if you go in knowing what to expect, perhaps you will appreciate it for exactly what it is.

For the record, I think the final shot of the sun setting over the water, with the horizon vanishing between the sun and its own reflection, is perhaps the most beautiful scene I have ever witnessed on film.  They definitely saved the best for last in a film rife with both tranquil and striking imagery.",1033344000,,911,4.770700636942675
7848894,2,6303504159,"Being a huge fan of Eno's music and his methods of making that music, I thought this might be an interesting peek inside the life and/or mind of  this talented musician/producer.  Nope.  The film starts off with promise  in that you do see Eno in his studio dicussing sounds, ideas, etc.  It then  begins the first in a series of increasingly irritating (in my mind)  ""landscape"" shots with his music playing over the top.  You may  get a snippet of conversation here and there, but it mostly is just bad  films of open highways, clouds and scenery shot from a car with his music  over the top.  I fell asleep the first time I watched it.  I tried again  the next day thinking I was just tired.  Nope.  It's just that dull.",965347200,,723,4.363636363636363
