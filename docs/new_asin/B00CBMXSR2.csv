5712539,5,B00CBMXSR2,"I don't want to say anything about the story itself, so as not to give anything away. Suffice it to say, the short film does not take long to watch but is worth every minute with a nice payoff conclusion. It absolutely makes the wheels start turning inside your head - and isn't this really what good entertainment and films are all about ?",1369094400,2,340,4.328125
5712570,5,B00CBMXSR2,"Dark and wild, his brief film puts you on a quick, but powerful, joyride of questions and answers, coupled with your own fast-changing emotions. The first thought that came to my mind when I saw the car crash scene  was ""Rod Serling would love this"".  But this story is the Twilight Zone at a higher level.  I came away from this brief film very amused with myself, because at one point while watching I laughed out-loud, only to  end up questioning that emotional response by the next scene (uh, oh, I shouldn't have been laughing).  The director Mr. Colonna sure knows how to toy with my emotions!

PS This may be only a 4 minute short film but it stays in your mind for days!",1427587200,,678,4.384
5712571,1,B00CBMXSR2,One and a half minutes of film school video. A minute of credits. A minute of promo. Not good or interesting at all.,1395446400,,116,4.086956521739131
5712572,5,B00CBMXSR2,"Spellbound by this Film maker.  Alex Colonna knows how to pull you in to a dark edgy world, and leave you with just as many questions as answers.  Captivating and worth every minute.",1376697600,2,182,4.484848484848484
5712573,5,B00CBMXSR2,"""REW"" is truly an original. creepy, intriguing, and eye capturing! It is well written, directed, and the cinematography is spectacular. From beginning to end the film is professionally executed. I truly am inspired by the director and his vision.",1371686400,2,246,5.333333333333333
5712574,5,B00CBMXSR2,"The film REW was thought provoking,it made me think of of wrong choices that someone wish they could take back, the sound of the drink being poured was mesmerizing, the look of confusion on the characters face told of his inner pain. Great job",1369785600,3,243,4.545454545454546
5712575,5,B00CBMXSR2,"For a short film it was fully packed!!! Great drama, lighting, sound and special affects.
I felt in the moment watching the intensity of the way it was filmed.
I loved and and would love to see more!!
Great Job!
I see a great future for the film maker and every one involved!",1369785600,2,275,4.2075471698113205
5712576,5,B00CBMXSR2,"The film REW looked like it was in the style of a Japanese horror genre for which we love. In addition the film showed originality, good directing and a haunting atmosphere. This short film definitely had my husband and I debating and thinking of the many possibilities. Very intriguing. Would like to view more in addition to seeing if our assumptions are correct. Well done Alex.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rew/dp/B00CBMXSR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rew</a>",1369180800,2,509,6.391304347826087
5712577,5,B00CBMXSR2,"Kubrick & Hitchcock came to my mind as I watched REW, two of the very best at what they did. They made you think and search to find the answers, also opening your mind to other possibilities. Alex Colonna is on the right path to becoming another classic filmmaker.",1369180800,2,264,4.408163265306122
5712578,5,B00CBMXSR2,"I saw ""Rew"" at the Pollygrind Film Festival and was very impressed by it. The guy that made this film has a great imagination! This is a truly original idea and is executed expertly. I'd love to see him extend the idea into a feature length film or just see what the filmmaker has in store for us next. Either way the guy who made this film has a great future ahead of him.",1369094400,2,373,4.054054054054054
5712579,5,B00CBMXSR2,"The writer of this well directed short flick understands what good screenwriters should always be striving for: ""Show Don't Tell.""

8579961,3,B00CBMXSR2,"REW is a 4 minute film that is worth the watch; however, it's really only worth that watch.  A man chooses suicide and is replaying that part of his life; the choice, the action, and his death.  These are replayed for the viewer.  Music was so so...  Acting was decent for a 4 minute flick.  Voices could have been improved upon.",1476921600,,329,4.327868852459017
8579962,1,B00CBMXSR2,It's 4 minutes long. I don't understand why these shorts are on prime.,1476230400,,70,4.461538461538462
8579963,1,B00CBMXSR2,"All of the other reviews must be left by people who are related to the filmmaker.  Interesting idea, bad execution. Just plain terrible everything.  I would have more respect for the film if it didn't have fake reviews.",1475539200,,219,4.7368421052631575
