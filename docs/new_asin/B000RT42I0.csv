2874954,5,B000RT42I0,"Although I am more than a decade past the teen years, I am a brand new knitter and decided to give the DVD a try.  It is very well done, with simple instructions and great demonstrations.  The dialogue can be a bit much at times, but it's also pretty cute and takes me back to when I was a youngster.  Definitely recommended if you are a beginner student of knitting.",1234396800,7,367,4.214285714285714
2874955,5,B000RT42I0,"This is a FABULOUS and fun how-to-knit DVD for beginners and more advanced young knitters alike.  The host, Chelsea Povall, is warm, informed, and engaging. In addition to the basics, it covers various aspects of knitting such as picking up dropped stitches and felting.  The viewer can easily jump around on the DVD to any section.  It's focused on encouraging young people that knitting is constructive, creative, and cool!  Nicely done.  I'll be giving several of these out at the holidays.",1186617600,16,493,5.037037037037037
2874966,5,B000RT42I0,"I know this is marketed to teens, but I think this is a great product for anyone trying to learn to knit.  This DVD does a great job at breaking down the basic knitting skills.  I ordered it after finding some clips from this DVD on YouTube and it was a worthwhile purchase!",1393459200,,274,4.150943396226415
2874967,5,B000RT42I0,I agree with a lot of the posts saying it is a little campy.  But for the absolute beginner such as myself the instructions are simple and clear.  The DVD is divided in such a way as to make it simple to review information as required.  All in all a good guide for the absolute beginner.,1390780800,,287,4.089285714285714
2874968,3,B000RT42I0,"both me and my friend tried this. We are men, retired. We couldn't get the hang of it
but the kit is good everything you need to get started
but for some reason after watching the video over and over we just could not grasp it!
Now that does not mean it won't work for you...there really isn't any reason why it wouldn't,
unless you are as clueless as us and perhaps the wrong sex.",1379203200,10,381,4.093333333333334
2874969,4,B000RT42I0,"I was pleased with the low price offered and that it has needles and yarn to start your learning.  Yes the video is cheesy and takes a few tries to master the moves but it does make it easy to understand.  The title screen was a little difficult to navigate when trying to look for a particular lesson to refresh my memory.  I wish it also taught continental, but those videos can be found online.",1368662400,4,397,4.266666666666667
2874970,5,B000RT42I0,"Bought this because it was so inexpensive and I had been wanting to learn how to knit, very easy-going presentation with lots of time to practice, easy to navigate and easy to understand, provides a great foundation of information if you're just starting out!",1367107200,3,259,4.909090909090909
2874971,3,B000RT42I0,"i bought this for kicks and when i opened it to watch the dvd....well lets just say, it REALLY is for teens. It's a little on the cheezy side. Great concept for teens who are interested in learning how to knit.",1365292800,3,210,4.146341463414634
2874972,4,B000RT42I0,This is a great gift for young ladies who became interested in learning to knit after receiving a knitted gift from me.,1358121600,2,119,4.454545454545454
2874973,5,B000RT42I0,"Well, I'm in my thirties and I am a guy. So that right there gave me some trepidation ordering a video aimed for teenagers. But once you get over the set that looks like a hybrid of your local Starbuck's combined with 'The Maxx' from Saved by the Bell, there are some really great visuals, and great camera angles so you know what you need to be doing. I'm very visual, and at first I had purchased a beginner's book. It worked to a point, but this video solidified things for me. (BTW - in case you were curious, this video teaches the English style of knitting).

Knitting isn't something I ever grew up around; I just thought it seemed like an interesting and relaxing activity. Plus I could make stuff, so that would be utilitarian as well. I bought a skein of light-blue, acrylic, worsted-weight yarn (the color makes it easier to see your stitches), and started watching this.

Again, it felt weird watching a video aimed at the younger set, but I got over it. The production values (at least for this sort of DVD) are actually pretty high. The menu is laid out nicely, and at certain points in the instructions, the DVD automatically pauses so that you can finish a row and then press play to hop to the next lesson portion.

A lot of what really makes this DVD work so well (besides the camera angles) is the host, Chelsea. She is engaging without being over-the-top and corny, she interacts well with the kids, and she explains what she is doing, why she is doing it, and basically keeps the whole experience very light and fun. And, yes, she is also cute. That last bit is neither here nor there, but it isn't a bad thing (hey, I'm a guy!).

If you can get past the aim towards teens, and a set design that looks like Zack and A.C are about to walk in any moment, this is actually a very useful way to learn how to knit. Within a few hours, I was producing pretty good practice swatches!

I hope this helps!

Cheers!",1346889600,44,1926,4.350974930362117
2874974,5,B000RT42I0,"This is by far the best video that teaches knitting--for all ages (I haven't been a teen for a very long time!  I do have teenage children though).  The instructor is great, the lighting is great, and the camera angle is over the RIGHT shoulder, not the left.  For some reason, seeing it over the right shoulder makes it much easier for me to learn.  Approximately the first half of this video can be viewed on Youtube which is what convinced me to buy it.  I rarely write reviews for anything but really wanted to promote this video in hopes that they'll come out with Volume II.",1270944000,22,580,4.383177570093458
2874975,4,B000RT42I0,"I decided to try this video to learn how to knit even though I'm not a teen. I figured it would be good for a beginner and it definitely taught me how to knit. It also had some cute little projects that are super easy for beginners, which I appreciated.  The dialogue was kind of cheesy, but the video showing the different stitches and troubleshooting some of the more common problems or mistakes were very helpful.  While I won't be trying all of the projects (lip balm holder? really?), there are a few that I've already tackled that came out great.  I also like the fact that I can pop the DVD back in now and use the little A-Z table of contents to go look up specific topics later without watching the whole video again.

The one thing I wish they covered, or maybe would put out a 2nd video for is what to do next.  I now find myself looking around for new patterns and projects, but I don't know how to read knitting patterns with all their codes, or they take on things a little more advanced like how to come to a point by decreasing rows by one or two stitches which I'd like to see some instruction on now.  Sounds like a job for No Rules Knitting II!",1258848000,9,1163,4.192825112107624
8202484,5,B000RT42I0,I bought this CD years ago to use for a group of school age kids.  Believe it or not the boys even wanted to learn.  This CD has lots of great information.  Shows you step by step of how to knit certain stitches etc. This CD actually helped make my job as an instructor easier.  In the end all the students has made a simple scarf.  Great CD. Worth the price.,1470960000,,359,4.0
8202485,2,B000RT42I0,DVD too complex for the child to maintain attention. I bought it for too young a child.,1454371200,,87,4.176470588235294
8202486,5,B000RT42I0,"Loved the easy to understand video.  Shipped quickly and was in perfect condition when it arrived.
BTW....I've convinced myself that knitting is not for me....I'm picking back up my crochet hook instead!!",1451952000,,204,5.375
8202487,3,B000RT42I0,"The DVD is great - very helpful! The included yarn is terrible and not much of it to actually make something but it is great to practice on. Overall, would recommend if the price were slightly lower.",1428796800,,199,4.405405405405405

8202490,5,B000RT42I0,"This video is good for knitters of any level.  Everything is very clearly shown and the narrator is great.  I purchased an extra one for a girl I am teaching to knit.  I love that they have boys knitting also.  It's a nice hobby for anyone to learn, very relaxing, keeps your mind active, you can make great gifts for people you love or don't even know, and you can take it anywhere.",1400803200,,383,4.205479452054795
8202491,4,B000RT42I0,I purchased this kit as a Christmas gift for a young girl I do not know.  I receive a Christmas wish list every year for a family in Appalachia we purchase gifts for and I hope she liked it!  It seemed simple enough for her age--young teen.,1396051200,,240,4.085106382978723
