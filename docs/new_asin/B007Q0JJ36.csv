It came out in '78,but the characters look much younger than that...Marshall doesnt look as old as when she was Laverne,of Laverne And Shirley,in '76,and Reiner doesnt look as old as when he played Meathead in All In The Family.

It works even better,because they really were married. I laughed all the way through it and remembered how crazy some of those situations were way back then. And I think it's very worth seeing,too.",1524700800,,581,4.752475247524752
8520919,5,B007Q0JJ36,"I remember seeing this movie and enjoyed it so much.  My son is about the age now that I was when I watched it, so we watched it together.  He laughed so hard and was engrossed in the movie.  I think this is the best thing that Penny Marshall has ever been in.",1524268800,,260,3.8679245283018866
8520920,5,B007Q0JJ36,I really loved this movie. Im a huge Penny and Rob fan and the movie was really enjoyable. They made the movie while they were still married and you can see how much they loved each other. They play really well off each other and they are very funny together! I highly recommend it:),1355961600,,283,4.2592592592592595
8520921,3,B007Q0JJ36,"I had just read Penny Marshall's new book and was curious about this one move with her and her ex-husband, Rob Reiner. This movie was supposed to be loosely based on their relationship. It is dated, but cute. I enjoyed it.",1355443200,,222,4.439024390243903
