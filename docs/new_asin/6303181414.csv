7840066,4,6303181414,"Very good movie...just the way I remembered It.  Last time I saw this movie was in 2001.  I enjoyed the erotic ""different"" plot of the movie.  It was along the same line as ""Two Moon Junction"" and ""Red Shoe Diaries.""  A very nice, ""pour a glass of wine, put on something more comfortable"" type of movie.",1280880000,3,303,4.357142857142857
7840067,1,6303181414,"Fatal Past is 100% direct-to-video trash.  No one, I repeat, no one associated with this film could say they were proud to be a part of it.  There is nothing good about this film. The first thing that annoyed me was the bad dubbing.  Most of the characters sound like they are talking directly into a microphone while the pictures have them far away.  I guess the dubbing was done to remove all the Australian accents & replace them with American accents.  This is not done to all characters & so there is a mix of live & dubbed dialogue. The dialogue is dreadful.  The acting is dreadful.  The production design is dreadful.  Almost nothing happens in the whole film.  People just talk about what may happen & how they feel about it - just like a soap. Costas Mandylor gives another wooden performance, this time as a body guard to a mobster's mistress.  The mobster is old & ugly.  The mistress is young & (supposed to be) good looking.  The bodyguard is young & good looking.  Gee, I wonder what's going to happen!! Don't bother.",975110400,5,1032,4.483870967741935
