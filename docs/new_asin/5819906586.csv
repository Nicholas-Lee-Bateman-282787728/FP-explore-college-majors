208089,5,5819906586,This movie is definitely worth buying. I rented it the other day from the Redbox it was so good I had to purchase it. This film had great acting and a great plot. A must see!,1363824000,,174,3.861111111111111
208090,5,5819906586,"I was delightfully surprised with the movie. It was suspenseful and kept you guessing till the end. It was like an extremely good lifetime movie, but then took a dark side with a surprise lesbian twist. I know it went straight to video, but I was highly recommend. Katie Cassidy made the movie with her amazing acting. Not to mention her hotness!",1363737600,18,346,4.596774193548387

208095,4,5819906586,"Kill For Me was an entertaining, fast paced thriller with a good cast, the stand out being 'Tracy Spiridakos' although Katie Cassidy is impressive as well.
The plot is Basically two girls become roommates in the wake of a local girls disappearance one having a fatal attraction type ex boyfriend while the other has an abusive father. The deal becomes I killed your psycho ex boyfriend so now in turn you must kill my abusive father.
This is when the twists,turns and the most dramatic and effective part of the story begins.
I can't say a lot as not to give away anything but I can say that I was glued to the screen and never quite sure how the plot was going to flow.
All in all it is a rewarding viewing experience that won't leave you scratching your head, mad or feeling cheated. I would watch it again so I will probably buy it.",1361232000,,835,4.358974358974359
208096,5,5819906586,"I really enjoyed this movie. I loved all the complex dynamics between the two female leads (Katie Cassidy and Tracy Spiridakos)! There relatoinship was friendly, then very passionate, and then hateful towards the end however they always came back to one another. I could not tell this was a ""low budget"" movie, the writing overall was good and the two female leads did an excellent job protraying their characters. I also loved the Special Features ""The Making of Kill For Me""...it was great getting to see the actresses actual personalities which surprisingly aren't what you would expect. I hope to see more action movies with either one of these two women! I highly recommend watching REVOLUTION if you have not seen it already, Tracy Spiridakos is fantastic!",1360800000,13,762,5.0078740157480315

I hate when they send it in thin plastic.  This is better quality and will have better protection.  I'll update this review once I watch the series.

208103,5,5819906586,"This Korean Drama is ""excellent"" funny and serious, I think actor Ji Sung is a ""Great Character Actor""  Who I think could easily be known or called as the Korean version of the American actor Johnny Depp ( Pirates Of The Caribbean)  Ji Sung have that same ability to take on different characters, and play then extremely well. Along with actress Hwang, Jung Eum  who together they both always have the perfect chemistry.

208119,2,5819906586,"This is one of those throw away movies that seem to come out straight to DVD and then disappear after a short time on the rack only to reappear on some lame channel that needs filler. That is to say it's not the worst movie ever made but it is far from being one you'll watch more than once if you make it through that.

The story revolves around a group of college students, two of which are home and one of which has gone missing. To help pay the rent the two girls take on a new roommate. It becomes convenient that this roommate is having problems with an abusive father since one of the two girls is having problems with an abusive father. Ala STRANGERS ON A TRAIN the two girls decide to help one another out by killing their respective abusers thus negating any connection that the police might find between the killer and the victim.

Along the way a semi-lesbian sequence takes place with the two leads finding themselves attracted to one another. As others who have watched the film have noted this seems intended to placate the supposed male need to watch two hot chicks have a go at it. Sorry but I've never found that something worth watching and when used as a sub-plot it seems more forced than natural anyway. It just becomes filler to make a movie that could have been shorter stretch out to 95 minutes.

The plot has been used before but that's not what makes the movie one to pass over. Instead it's the fact that not only have we seen this done before (and better) but that the supposed twists don't seem like twists at all. If you don't see the end coming early on then you've not watched many films. If the film is on when nothing else is on then you might want to watch. If you've become a fan of Katie Cassidy (David's daughter and star of TV's ARROW) then you might want to watch. Otherwise save your money.",1388448000,3,1832,4.319767441860465

Two young women in bad situations find themselves banding together, only to have worse things happen.  I was pleasantly surprised with some additions to said plot line, and the acting was good.  Some of the make-up, not so good.  If you watch the movie, you will see what I mean.
While this movie is a little too risqu&eacute; for a channel like Lifetime, with some editing, you possibly could see it on that channel in the future.

208127,2,5819906586,"SPOILER WARNING. You know that tired plot wherein the lesbian dies and the bisexual woman goes back to men? Yup. That plot should have stopped at its acme, High Art, with Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Alas, this movie tries to put a fresh spin on the old disappointment.

On the upside, the blond leading actress is quite decent - capable of behavioral nuances as her character develops, with a great expressive face - and very beautiful as a bonus. Her half of the all-too-brief sex scene is lusty and believable. When called upon to punch an aggressive male character at a later point, the blond lead is also credible. She's the best part of this movie, and I hope this actress appears in future movies of increasing quality.

Ah, and the brunette actress: also very beautiful, but unfortunately, only capable of two expressions: 1) blank robot face, and 2) half-hearted terror. Very unconvincing, zero depth. A bit embarrassing to watch her wooden non-contributions to the sex scene, and to the ""love affair"" in general. Was it a love affair even? Wouldn't it have to be love or obsession that keeps the characters initially enmeshed with each other? Plot weaknesses, one of many. For example, the brunette actress's lowest point: as she's pursued by an assailant with a shotgun, she falls into a freshly un-dug grave, and writhes sexily at the bottom - in a push-up bra - instead of attempting to run further or fight back (though in previous scenes we've seen her be robust enough to swing an iron and slap off an attacker). Really? Not sure if this inconsistency is the actress or the script or both.

The brunette lead does have a moment of faintly believable acting: seducing an older man over a cocktail, while sporting her ever-present pushup bra. Perhaps this is her comfort zone.

Older bearded male lead: very solid, decent. Surprising nuances, in spite of heavy-handed foreshadowing pertaining to his ""craftiness"" as a character.

Younger male supporting roles are both pretty hollow and forgettable.

But this movie gets at least one point for the amount of violent payback coming from the female characters. It's been years since Thelma and Louise, but you still don't often see this kind of abused-but-empowered revenge outside of something like Haywire or a Tarantino movie. So, that was cool. Women convincingly throwing punches, riding motorcyles, swinging axes and firing shotguns should have made for an exciting thriller. Alas, the poor writing!

I'd call the script medium-bad overall. Wooden exposition and breathy voiceover are beyond tiresome. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the development of the father/daughter conflict: the credibility of *both* characters is undermined as the plot progresses. The slow unspooling of murderous motives and mind games could have - and should have -  made a pretty exciting movie! Perhaps with tighter writing and a more convincing lesbian love affair? One can dream.",1368835200,3,2940,5.047422680412371

208134,4,5819906586,"Okay.  Plot-wise... this was a pretty good thriller.  It was suspenseful and kept me guessing dang near to the end.  The acting and filming were also excellent.  And my god, were these leads hot!!!  I really enjoyed these aspects of the film, and it's what ultimately earned the 4 stars.  Another reviewer who wrote that this was like a really good Lifetime Movie Network movie was spot on, lol.  I was shocked at how good this actually was!

But if you're hoping for the next best lesbian-themed film... forget it.  These two leads have off the charts plausible chemistry and look like the leads I want in ALL my lesfic romances, lol... but this isn't really a romance.  The storyline doesn't quite give them a chance to go there and that was a dang shame!!  They are just the victims of dysfunctional relationships.  What draws them together and bonds them together is not so much a romance, but rather their painful history with men... some dark and creepy stuff that evolves into a rollercoaster of emotional extremes.  But their attraction began as something very sensitive and almost healing.  Really sexy and beautiful.  Loved it.  I'm just sorry it dropped into the icky and unimaginative stereotype of lesbians being beautiful yet violently disturbed women who are undeserving of love.  It won't stop you from being engaged, but you'll wish these leads got a better hand.

What basically happens is that dark-haired and pretty Amanda has a roommate who's gone missing.  After some time she rents the room out to a lovely, albeit moody blonde (Haley).  Their initial attraction is palpable and you're gonna love the first 30 minutes or so, lol.  There are long, lingering looks, kissing, and a shower scene... but nothing particularly graphic and no nudity.  What follows is the intervention of a couple of crazy dudes who mess up all the awesome lesbian imagery-- Amanda's stalker and violent ex-boyfriend and Haley's twisted and abusive father.  And these women cannot be at peace until these men are removed from the planet, lol.  (Because a hatred of men bonds lesbos more than the passionately sexy love they could be sharing instead!!)  In any case, you end up not knowing who to trust and wondering who the bad people actually are.  And it is more than a little violent.  Tracy Spiridakos (Haley) is just amazing here... bought her as lesbian 150%.

It's worth a watch.  And even as is, it still blows on Nicole Conn's latest as far as lesbians go, lol.  I'd definitely watch it again.",1365292800,3,2500,4.800469483568075

208136,4,5819906586,"This is ""Roommate"" plus ""Horrible Bosses"" except its two women instead of 3 guys, there is no humor, and they're not bosses. Okay maybe its not, but that's what I thought as I watched. College girl Natalie Ross goes missing. Haley (Tracy Spiridakos), who looks like Drew Barrymore saving the whales, shows up to rent her room. Amanda (Katie Cassidy) is her housemate.

Amanda has ex-bf(Andrew Zachar) issues while Haley has some serious daddy (Donal Logue) issues. Through a series of circumstances they help each other out. Hair twirling Amanda has reluctance in committing crimes, while Haley doesn't show enough restraint.

It is an interesting film. You can sense the twist at the end. For those who crave SWF type films, add this one to the list. It was well done, but not a barn burner. Killing, but limited on gore.
