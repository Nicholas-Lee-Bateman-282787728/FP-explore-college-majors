Great acting and such a wonderful window into a real part of the Jewish way of life.",1362614400,,118,4.173913043478261
4642736,5,B005AWEIP6,"Norah's Will is a beautifully directed film. The story could have taken place anywhere, but the fact that it takes place in Mexico City gives it a distinct flavor. The cast is well suited to the characters it portrays. Fernando Lujan's acting is endearing. The film is very subtle, touching and with an undertone of humor in a very serious situation. It flows very well and resolves as Norah wished.",1361145600,2,399,4.714285714285714
4642737,5,B005AWEIP6,"Nora has struggled with mental illness all her life, and decides to stop fighting just before Passover. But before she takes her pills, she indulges in final acts of manipulation and micromanagement upon her estranged husband, her son, his wife, and her two grandchildren, and even the housekeeper. This fine movie, alternatively funny and bitter and ironic, covers a few days after Nora's suicide and what happens to her family and friends.  It's a funny and  touching movie about death and religion. Maybe that sounds bizarre, but at a satisfying  level the movie deals with problems of life's ending that we must all face, whatever method we employ to exit this mortal coil.",1336867200,,677,4.9734513274336285
4642738,5,B005AWEIP6,"As a Sephardic Jew, I loved this movie and needed to correct Hiram's review stating this was a movie of an Askenazi Jew. Askenazi Jews are not the same as Sephardic Jews. Our culture stems from our expulsion from Spain and Portugal in 1492 and 1494. We are not from Eastern Europe. We speak Ladino (spoken in the movie) not Yiddish. The foods shown in the movie, Bulemas, Borekas, Bumuelas, and Yprakis are Sephardic foods, not Askenazi foods. This movie is absolutely wonderful. It involves a mysterious love story and a conflict between an atheist Sephardic Jew and local Sephardic Rabbis. It is about the ritual Sephardic Passover dinner, an ex-wife who commits suicide and her burial. Amazingly it all ends up in a perfect ending. It's a great black comedy.",1322524800,3,761,4.816793893129771
4642739,3,B005AWEIP6,"""Nora's Will"" is a funny, touching movie about faith and family colliding. More effective for not escalating to farce and/or hysterics as an American version of the story might have.",1321660800,2,182,5.1
4642740,5,B005AWEIP6,"This doesn't sound like a comedy: A depressed divorcee commits suicide after elaborately planning the reunion of her sadly fragmented family in the five days following her death. But, the newly released Nora's Will (also known as Five Days without Nora) has been showered with rave reviews as an entertaining comedy.

How can this be a comedy? Think Woody Allen, except that Nora's Will was created by hot young Mexican director Mariana Chenillo, who now is in her mid 30s, but wrote and produced this mature look at a dysfunctional family while she still was in her 20s. The Mexican National Fund for the Arts and Culture helped to support her work. Clearly, she is a fan of Woody Allen's family comedies like Hannah and Her Sisters. Chenillo's comedy bears the Allen influence right down to the opening and closing titles set in simple white type against a black screen.

Why should you see this strangely cross-cultural comedy? Well, first, this actually is more cross-cultural than you might expect. Nora's family is Jewish--or, to be more precise, various relatives and associates of the family once were Jewish, or are Jewish converts, or are trying hard to be friends of Jewish culture. Nora's ex-husband, in fact, now is so brashly anti-religious that he delights in provoking the family's Jewish friends. (Think Larry David in Woody Allen's 2009 comedy Whatever Works.) On top of that, the film's setting is the eve of Passover with the Passover Seder playing a key role in Nora's elaborate reunion plans. So, American viewers are flying away to Mexico for a Spanish-language comedy (with English subtitles). We are jumping into the heart of a dysfunctional Jewish family in the midst of wildly conflicting expectations about orthodox Passover and funeral customs. Your head will spin just a bit.

Will you laugh? You certainly will smile. If nothing else, you'll grin in the final scenes, including the angry old ex-husband on a balcony in the closing moments. While this clearly is a farce, there are dozens of delightfully honest human moments, including the grandchildren who are stuck in this claustrophobic house day after day and simply can't resist playing near the empty casket awaiting Grandma. No, don't worry, there's no tragedy with the casket, but children do wind up acting out favorite movie scenes amid the gloomy setting. You can't help but smile.

Why haven't you heard of this film before today? Perhaps you're not watching recent movie reviews. The LA Times' esteemed critic Kenneth Turan calls it ""poignant and tremendously appealing."" Popular author and critic Leonard Maltin raves, too:, calling it ""quiet, original, irreverent"" and ""an import that's truly worth seeing.""

Why see it now? That's easy. As I post this review in autumn 2011, Americans are discovering the first wave of ""holiday movies"" on the shelves at Target and Wal-Mart, which mostly means home-for-Thanksgiving and snowflake-dusted Christmas movies. This year, you'll even see a brand-new DVD edition of the granddaddy of contemporary holiday-reunion dramas: Ed Asnwer's 1976 made-for-TV movie The Gathering in which a dying, troublesome family patriarch tries to reunite his conflicted family at the holidays. Since Asner's masterful drama, we've seen dozens of Hollywood and made-for-TV knock offs replay this same theme--generally with cloyingly sweet plot twists designed to wring a few tears before the closing credits. Compared with that lot, Nora's Will is a bracingly refreshing cup of holiday cheer.",1319500800,3,3511,5.196113074204947
8463714,5,B005AWEIP6,"I love this story. Learning of an Orthodox Jewish community in Mexico was wonderful. The family members were lovable, and the story was endearing with sweet, comedic moments. Smartly written with wonderful actors. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1516838400,,235,5.742857142857143

8463719,5,B005AWEIP6,"As a rule, I don't purchase DVRs. As Nora's Will is a classic (Cinco dias sin Nora) it will be played again and again for my family's pleasure. The writing and acting is comparable to Les Miserables.",1407715200,,199,4.405405405405405
8463720,5,B005AWEIP6,A comic tale of that proves one can legislate from the grave.  The frustrations that occur when a non-practicing Jew is faced with the problem of burying his ex- wife who had organized the burial before she died.  This is laugh-out-loud funny as the protagonist tries to solve the problems that arise.,1397347200,,301,4.769230769230769

8463722,4,B005AWEIP6,"This is a surprisingly subtle exploration of complex relationships and the interplay of Jewish belief, practices, and lives.
