8525193,4,B0084K6IEA,"Yes A.C.A.B. stand for all cops are `born out of wedlock' or words to that effect and there was a punk band with exactly the same name and I do wonder if they were the inspiration for the title, as there is some old school music in this including `The Clash' and `The White Stripes', so we can only guess. Anyway this is about Italy's `controversial' polizia riot squad. The story is told through the eyes of three of the veterans and one new rookie. The squad leader is a bit on the right side of the political spectrum and so should not be over surprised to discover his rebellious son has gone slightly right of Mussolini. This causes inevitable friction that spills into the job.

There is also the cop Nero, whose wife has kicked him out and he just wants access to his daughter, the rookie who can't seem to fit in and they all seem to have to do jobs on the side to make ends meet. Meanwhile they seem to get all the rotten gigs, like policing the football matches, strikes and evicting tenants for the corrupt town hall. Needless to say they take out a lot of their frustrations on the public they are sent to police and are increasingly alienated from both the public they are meant to serve and the bosses who pay them to do this service. Pierfrancesco Fabino (`Romanza Criminale' and `Angels and Demons') as `Cobra' puts in a particularly strong performance as the vet trying to hold everything together whilst being under suspicion for use of excessive force.

This also deals with the extreme politics and the issues around immigration and the social consequences that come with having to face a situation where strangers in your country appear to get favourable treatment, the feeling that tolerance is a luxury only those who don't have to live with the consequences can really afford.

This is actually a very good film with ok to good sub titles, some excellent performances a bleedin good sound track and enough gritty realism to keep most people amused. It has one of those endings that won't please everyone as you will probably be wanting more. That aside this is a rollicking yarn and asks more questions than it could ever attempt to even suggest answers for. All in all a film for Europhiles and police films where the sirens still go nee naa nee naa - brilliant.",1358035200,2,2287,4.559610705596107
8525194,5,B0084K6IEA,"Few films are successful when it comes to actually feeling that you've been inside the screen. This one does, and does it flawlessly.
I can't think of one single thing that is not in perfect sync in this movie: photography, locations, story, acting, costumes, even the extras.
A story beautifully woven and told. You'll come out feeling you've been there and felt that same fear, incredulity, rage. That you've just been to Rome and seen the crows and the vandals as well as the cops, but for the cops you've worn their protective gear, just as they did.
Great movie. IMHO, thumbs all the way up.",1342656000,,596,4.632075471698113
