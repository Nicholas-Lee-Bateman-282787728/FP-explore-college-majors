8226197,4,B000WZAE8G,"""The Kingdom"" Season 2, is the second installment in a trilogy that has no end. Lars Von Triers made ""The Kingdom"" with the intention that it would be a trilogy of mini-series, but unfortunately, after the second season, both Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), that is, the two main actors, died, putting a stop to Season Three (and to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't like to see a season without these actors). As a result of this, few of the story lines introduced in Season 1 are resolved in Season 2, and the ending comprises a number of cliff-hangers that Von Triers, presumably, intended to resolve in Season 3.

Keeping that in mind, Season 2 of ""The Kingdom"" isn't bad. Season 2 starts off immediately after the end of Season 1: Dr. Helmer is back from Haiti with his zombie poison; Bondo has his sarcoma; Judith has just given birth to her monster baby; and a new set of spirits is now loose in the hospital for Mrs. Drusse to deal with. In my opinion, Season 1 was better, I found the first two episodes of Season 2 to be a bit tedious (I didn't like the sub-plot about Prof. Moesgaard seeking psychiatric help or the one about Judith and her baby, at all). However, the final two episodes more than make up for them, and by the end, I really did want to see more.

Highlights of this series include Dr. Hook turning into a patient-hating psychopath, after a rather unpleasant incident (I found Hook to be smug and self-righteous in Season 1, so really enjoyed this change of character); the revelation of Aage Kruger's true nature; ambulance racing; and a new mystery for Mrs Drusse to solve. There is also a greater focus on the occult in this season, and I found this season to be both sillier and scarier than the previous one.

Fans of ""The Kingdom"" Season 1, will definitely enjoy Season 2, but don't go in expecting a satisfactory conclusion or you'll be disappointed.",1207180800,7,1918,4.58600583090379
8226198,4,B000WZAE8G,"This is the second and final season of Lars von Trier's Riget (Kingdom). As we learn from the commentary and featurette, the third and concluding season was never filmed because Danmarks Radio which commissioned the first two, lost all interest in it. A major impediment was the fact that 4 of the main stars had died in the interim.  Most notably the charismatic Ernst-Hugo Jregrd who played Prof. Stig Helmer the dyspeptic and bigoted Swedish neurosurgeon. Kirsten Rolffes who played Mrs Drusse, the endearing hypochondriac and spirit-medium had also died by then. Morton Leffers the male half of the Dishwasher duo had also passed away. The Dishwashers were the pair with Down's Syndrome who acted as a kind of Scandinavian Greek Chorus intoning cryptic revelations and other surreal comments along the way. Ironically, the actor who played Death in Series 2 also died. As Lars von Trier quipped in the commentary, the quickest way to the crematorium was through Riget.

Series 2 takes place immediately after the events of Series 1. However it was shot some 3 years later. The children especially look much older - notably Mona the brain-damaged girl and Mary the ghost-child. Series 2 is zanier, weirder. Playing more towards comedy than horror. Nevertheless it's still very entertaining. Von Trier claims that even the Danish Royal Family were fans. In Series 1, Helmer the Swede, constantly went up on the rooftop to gaze longingly at his beloved Sweden, proudly and reverentially listing all of Sweden's wonderful achievements, ""Tetra-pak, Volvo, Hepstars, Bjorn Borg,"" before looking around him in utter disgust at the backwater in which he has landed and screaming in exasperation ""Dansk Jvlar"" (Danish Scum). In Series 2 he adopts a new practise of screaming his ever increasing vitriol into a toilet bowl before flushing it down the sewer. The Swedish-Danish animosity is hilarious and can be easily appreciated even by non-Scandinavians.

Be warned. The series does not tie up its loose ends. It was meant to continue into a third season so it actually ends in a sort of cliffhanger - one which we unfortunately will never see resolved. Thankfully the main ""Little Brother"" storyline is brought to a conclusion.

The series is again shot on 16mm film. It is grainy but less so than previously. Post-production was done digitally. It is presented in roughly 1.33:1 fullscreen. The picture quality is better all round than on the previous DVD. Thankfully, no DVD defects this time round. It is shot in the same dogme style as previously, hand held, jerky, with natural lighting. Everything is sepia tinted with a warm golden tone. There are more special effects with more ghostly apparitions than before.

The DVD comes with a 40-minute interview with Lars von Trier where he discusses his various works for TV and Cinema including The Kingdom miniseries and of course his Cannes Film Festival triumph ""Breaking the Waves"". Well worth the price. Not quite like anything else on TV. Just be aware that there will be no neat conclusion. For those who need to have everything nicely wrapped up, get Stephen King's ""Kingdom Hospital"". King was so impressed with von Trier's miniseries that he wrote his own American version, set of course in his native Maine. Apparently King had access to sketches of von Trier's third season. Unfortunately King's version doesn't quite come up to the calibre of the original, especially in terms of its macabre humour.

PS. Don't miss the accompanying Music Video (The Shiver). It's hilarious. Lars von Trier performs what can best be described as a ""spastic"" dance with several cute Danish nurses.",1203120000,7,3640,5.058333333333334
8226199,4,B000WZAE8G,"I just finished both Series 1 and Series 2 of The Kingdom or RIGET in Danish, or was it Swedish? I am now nursing the huge headache I've obtained from battling to read the sub-titles and trying to watch at the same time... very difficult at times. This series, if you do not know already, is the series which inspired the Stephen King U.S. version from a couple of years ago called Kingdom Hospital. And much of the story is the same, with mostly the same characters. However, do not expect the same character to behave the same way in both versions. There are enough variations in the plot to make each shine on its own. A few additional notes of warning... this series 2 is NOT the conclusion of the story, even though this is the claim on the packaging. Also, this version, as one might expect, being from europe, is more risque' than american viewers are used to. I've seen more sex and gore in motion pictures, but not very much more. Additionally, there are some serious visual and scripted references to demons and satanism present in the european version. I would suggest that the viewer arm themselves for a psychic nightmare/roller coaster ride should you decide to purchase this series. If these elements frighten you too much, perhaps you should stick to the american version, Kingdom Hospital.",1201132800,4,1306,4.682608695652174
