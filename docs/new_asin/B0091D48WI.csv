8534083,4,B0091D48WI,"Before I watched The Survival Game, I checked out a couple sites to read what it was about. 1 site said Four friends out camping trip are being hunted by a group of gangsters & another said members of the mafia that think that they have something that belongs to them (Something like that) I wouldn't consider the bad guys gangsters or members of the mafia, They seemed more like criminals. When I 1st started watching (After seeing what the *mafia members/gangsters* looked like) I thought, What a laugh. That was until the copter jacking happened (Cold Blooded) then the 1 *mafia member/gangster* got dropped out the copter (Cold Blooded again!!! Now the movie has my full attention & I don't find the *mafia members/criminals* so laughable anymore) I'm REALLY glad I didn't turn off the movie after watching the 1st couple minutes like I wanted to. After the 1st 2 copter scenes I was hooked till the very end. This is a surprisingly good movie that is worth sticking around for",1423785600,,981,4.709302325581396
