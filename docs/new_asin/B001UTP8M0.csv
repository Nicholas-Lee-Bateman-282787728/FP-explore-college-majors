I was given 'Vol-1 U6-U8' when I went for my coaching license. It was very useful, but I wanted something for the U12 age group that I coach. This DVD (Vol 2 - U10-U12) was just what I was looking for ...and at an unbelievably low price! I found the audio/video quality very good. It's chapters are well thought out. Each activity is preceded by a screen with simple instructions to guide you. I found the practice activities and tips very useful. It has the following chapters:

Introduction
Under-10 Activities (contains 18 sub-sections)
Under-12 Activities (contains 15 sub-sections)
How to set up the practice area
Field Player Skills
Goalkeeper Skills
PDF Companion Booklet

The PDF Companion Booklet can be downloaded to your PC.",1319500800,,780,4.938931297709924
