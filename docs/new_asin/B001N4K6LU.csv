3711101,5,B001N4K6LU,"I have used a 30-minute routine developed from this great old DVD for 12+ years, about 6 times a week, so about 1800 hours.  Excellent for flexibility and fitness.  Scott doesn't obsess about teaching the 24-form Yang style Tai Chi, so if you're into performance Tai Chi, move on.  Otherwise, this is a fabulous intro to movement like you've never experienced it before.",1494633600,,370,4.841269841269841
3711102,4,B001N4K6LU,"When I first tried this DVD, I thought it moved a little too fast for me in spots, and I had trouble keeping up with some of the moves.  But I tried it again a couple months later and really like it.  I've been doing Scott's other Tai Chi for Beginners DVD's, and now that I've been doing them for about 6 months, the moves are more familiar and this DVD was easier to follow.  If I can't keep up with a step, I just keep moving and do the best I can at it.

I have several of Scott Cole's Tai Chi for Beginners DVD's.  I think he's the best instructor for this.  He goes slow enough to explain the moves and just makes it enjoyable to exercise.

I haven't lost any weight since doing Tai Chi, but I'm definitely more flexible, and my pants are a lot looser, so I must be toning up.  I can sit cross-legged on the floor now but couldn't when I started.  I find it easier to climb my 15 steps now, and I don't mind having to bend over to pick up things that I've dropped.  I can't say enough good things about Scott Cole's DVD's.",1494201600,,1028,3.9950980392156863

We started slowly, doing more of the practice as our strength allowed.  Now we are able to comfortably go through the entire program.  Our stamina, flexibility and balance are improving.  The directions are clear and progress from a smooth warm up to more demanding forms and end with a gentle cool down.  when we come closer to understanding the subtleties, we plan to get another DVD from this series.",1490659200,,528,4.623655913978495

3711114,4,B001N4K6LU,"this video uses tai chi moves in both slow and fast routines. Having done the AM and PM workout video by Scott Cole I was familiar with his approach and found his instruction easy to follow as opposed to some other Tai Chi videos which go through the forms step by step. This video goes through different motions and combines slow with fast tai chi. While the fast tai chi will naturally burn more calories than the slow, I wouldn't solely depend on this to lose weight but it will help and can be fun to do.

3711124,3,B001N4K6LU,"This is the first Tai Chi DVD I ever bought. I looked at reviews, and saw this looked quite promising. I did love how Scott Cole broke down all the movements. It made it easy to understand how to perform each movement. I also like how he explained the flow of energy. I was all set to write a glowing review and give it 5 stars. Then came when all the movements were put together. They switched scenes from him inside to outside. With being outside, they added a bunch of fancy camera shoot. Some where shot above, looking over his shoulder. Others were from the waist up that did not show his legs. The shots might look nice, but were very hard for a beginner to follow. I would have been happier with straight on body shots, so I could more easily follow his movements.",1473552000,,771,4.287671232876712

3711132,2,B001N4K6LU,he is good but the photography isn't what is needed for someone to follow the movements. you need to see the whole movement to follow not shots just showing chest and head or a zoom out of a arm you miss 2 or 3 movements at a time with artistic shots.,1461542400,,251,3.9411764705882355

3711141,1,B001N4K6LU,"I want to preface my review by saying that I think that Scott Cole is an absolutely wonderful instructor.  In this video he radiates warmth, patience, and competency.  If I had a chance to take one of his classes in person I would be thrilled. With that being said I rated this video a one for the following reasons:

1. DO YOU LIKE REALLY LOUD MUSIC? I MEAN REALLY LOUD MUSIC! Congrats this video is for you.  The music on this video drowns out the instructors voice. If you turn it up to hear his voice, the music is simply unbearable loud.  This isn't very tai chi-ish of me, but the sound engineer should be taken out and shot.

2. This is described as a BEGINNERS video. As such it should show the instructors full body at all times. Nope, in what I can only assume the director was operating on the belief that it would be interesting, the camera angles change throughout the video.  Sometimes it shows a mirror image (which is nice and how it should be), but then it switches to waist up only shots.  Even that I could get through but then, during the full practice, it changes abruptly to a shot from behind the instructor! So you are completely thrown off.  Then it switches to a three-quarter shot from the side.  At one point they only show a close-up of Scotts hands. So to recap, in a beginners video, the camera angles switch from mirror, to waist up, to behind, to three quarters, to hand close-ups.  The director and film editor should be shot.

Scott, if you ever read this, please redo this video!",1456099200,,1515,4.39068100358423

It is just a video of Scott Cole doing Tai chi.  There is NO instruction at all.

3711173,5,B001N4K6LU,"This is a fantastic introductory Tai Chi DVD - the best I've found. Scott Cole is a wonderful instructor - he communicates concepts and positions very clearly using a mirroring technique so the viewer doesn't confuse left and right. He is a pleasure to listen to, and easy on the eyes. Scott uses warm and supportive language, demystifying Tai Chi and erasing the beginner intimidation factor. After a very short introduction you jump right in to doing basic Tai Chi. You will practice several basic positions and movements with special attention to posture and breathing, followed by an invitation to ""put it all together"". The natural settings and soothing Asian New Age music enhance the experience fully. I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.

So I got this Scott Cole video.  He introduces you to elementary Tai Chi and Chi Gong moves and then puts them in routines (or ""flows"") with music and scenery that add to the experience.  It really does all the things you hear Tai Chi is supposed to do for you:  relieve stress, relax you, focus you, energize you.

By the way, he performs all the moves in ""mirror image"" so he is very easy to follow.

If you're a beginner, this gets you succeeding at Tai Chi very quickly.  Highly Recommended.  Enjoy.",1413504000,,709,4.384615384615385

3711194,5,B001N4K6LU,"I originally checked this out at my library to try it before I bought it on here and I love the gentle yet aerobic moves.  It starts off slow and gradually moves you into a workout with an up and down pace that incorporates cardio and strength training using your own body weight.  This is great for those who are working on flexibility issues and for people of size like me who need a good cardio and strength workout but cannot contort their bodies into all of the stuff the traditional aerobic workouts have.  You can go slower or faster to adjust the workout to your ability and it is great for joint issues just adjust your stance to accommodate for knee or other issues.  This is a great workout for cardio, strength, flexibility, and just centering yourself and relaxing.  Scott Cole has a soothing yet strong voice while leading the moves that encourages yet relaxes and just promotes a good sense of self worth.  Trust me this is just a great video overall and even beginners would have no problem with following the workout.",1397692800,,1034,4.562162162162162
3711195,4,B001N4K6LU,"Scott Cole really does a good job on this DVD.  He goes slow and his instructions are clear and concise.  They are easy to follow. But in the second half after the instructions where he goes into the actual flow movement his camera person doesn't know what they are doing focusing close shots on his upper torso, his rear end, his hands, and face, or a side view of the movements and fading in and out with the camera.  So it makes it difficult to follow. It's important to have a front view of the actual flow movements especially if you are just learning like I am, as in the first half of the DVD in order to make it easy to follow.  It is too bad Mr. Cole didn't instruct his camera person who obviously does not not how to film an exercise DVD on the importance of filming a front full body exposure all the way through the movements. This is why I only gave it four stars.",1397433600,,878,4.147058823529412

3711218,2,B001N4K6LU,"As other reviewers have said, it is a little weird looking at this guys bare chest throughout this video.  I won't go so far as so say it is disrespecting the tradition but it does illustrate that what is here is not traditional.  You do see many forms/postures from Tai Chi, but this presentation is not to learn traditional Tai Chi form like Yang style in it's normal presentation.  This is more like exercise for people who like to think they are doing Tai Chi, which in part is true.  But the presentation is very loose (no shirt) and the last segment is our glorious instructor, in all his bare-chested beauty, showing his moves with weird camera angles and so on.  Kinda like hollywood Tai Chi.  It's a bit like what happened with Yoga when it came to America, watered down and placed in a fast food context (often as a workout rather than an art).

So if you want to learn Tai Chi you should know YMAA is the best resource.  This DVD is much more worth your time to get started&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simplified-Tai-Chi-Chuan-With-Applications/dp/B000BL02F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simplified Tai Chi Chuan With Applications</a>.

This second DVD is showing a longer form Tai Chi (+100 moves) and is intimidating for a newbie.  Dr Yang, though he is an expert and you will really learn the martial arts meanings of most moves, he tends to talk a little too much going off on (interesting) tangents.  The problem is you learned a move and then are standing there for many minutes listening to an explanation before being able to see and learn the next move.  This pause and break in the teaching is distracting and you can easily loose concentration and interest.",1373068800,,2005,5.5130718954248366
3711219,4,B001N4K6LU,"As a newcomer to this type of exercise (a middle-aged woman someone who hasn't exercised regularly for a while), I went in search of a beginner's course in Tai Chi. All in all, Scott's approach to beginners is excellent. He moves slowly and gently and the explanations are clear. I am not ashamed to admit that I am directionally challenged and very poorly coordinated so I needed something that was this simple and direct. Because of this, I cannot tell you how grateful I am for the mirrored approach to instruction. I am a little over two weeks into this and other than hiking (which my schedule doesn't allow for regularly) and gardening (which is seasonal), this is the first form of exercise in some time that I've decided that I truly like. I am already seeing a little long-lost flexibility returning, slightly better muscle tone, and my lower back no longer hurts when I wake up in the morning. I've had to skip two days and have found that I really did miss it.

That said, I have one--what is to me--important complaint and I hope that the powers that be are listening. In second half of the DVD when it moves into the more ""advanced"" moves (or the core of Tai Chi), the directors resort to what I can only describe as artsy-fartsy camera angles and for someone who is still relying on the leadership of the instructor and is not ready to work on their own, this not only distracting--it's frustrating. When they shift to rear or above angles, it's difficult to determine what direction I should be moving, whether we've changed sides, and how I should be standing. And when they pull in close for upper body shots, I lose track of where my feet should be. I've been doing this for just over two weeks now and continue to wrestle with this portion of the video. And while I recognize that it takes time to master Tai Chi and that I should probably be patient with myself (especially considering the above description), I think it bears mentioning. I hope if there is a remake of this video at some point, that they will take this onboard.",1372982400,,2049,4.522911051212938

I still fumble around some, but feel confident that after practice, this will improve.  This DVD speeds up the forms we did in the slower more traditional DVDs so that you work up a sweat and burn some calories.  It's fun and so what if you don't get all the moves just right at first?

If there is anything I found negative about the presentation, it would be that I think the whole program should have been filmed outdoors on the beach, as that places one in the right frame of mind and makes it more enjoyable.  Also, there were times when Mr. Cole's upper body only was shown, and you don't know what he is doing with his legs, although you know he is doing something.

3711241,2,B001N4K6LU,"Perhaps I ask too much, but this thing is boring, the movements are uninteresting, presentation is too romanticized and shown from the wrong view.
Some background: Yup, I'm well over 60 and want to stay fit and limber. My preference is for activities that involve maintenance of endurance, strength and the learning of new skills. I snow ski and snow board in all forms including xc, run, skateboard and technical climb in the traditional manner. I have belts in Judo and have been interested in flowing body movements for some time. Some form of Tai Chi may be worth learning as part of my regular workout.
However, I do not need to see some flashy body-type with flowing hair performing elementary moves against crashing ocean waves in a tropical setting. Also, the camera angles change at inopportune times and interrupt solid analysis of what he does.
What I do not understand is why these alleged instructors fail to remember what we as students actually see...the mirror of what the moves should be. Doing the ""Brain Flip"" to understand what body part goes where is just plain inefficient. The solution is simple, use the old dance/aerobics class technique of placing big mirrors on the walls. Sure, there's that pesky problem of also having a shot of the video gear in the image area, but Geez folks, it's not insurmountable.
For those who have not maintained themselves over the years and want to improve, this may be a good start and I applaud you.
But, for those of us who have been at it for a long time and want something new, I suggest ""Shaolin 36 Form Cudgel"" (staff) dvd on Ebay. The dvd I have has a picture of a shaved head monk braced on his staff kicking his right leg almost straight up. I cannot speak for the other dvds available. All you need a six foot long SINGLE TAPER wax wood staff (about $30)and you are in business. I perform the whole routine before running and have gained flexibility, strength and coordination in body parts little used in my other pursuits. Looks and feels cool too.

It's builds strength and balance yet  in a very calm and mindful way. I finally feel my investment in a large flat screen TV is worth it because Scott's visual environment creates a work out studio for the instruction and than transforms into a beautiful beach setting in my living room. Scott is good at teaching and sets a lightly spiritual tone for training and practice. I suggest writing down the names of the movements as a list as you practice them.",1334534400,,613,4.572727272727272

I bought Scott Cole's beginner CD several months ago as a way to develop a tai chi habit. I wish I could tell  you I do tai chi every day - I don't! - but on the days I do, I thoroughly enjoy doing it with this CD. Scott Cole has the perfect style to instruct a beginner. He says the right words at the right moment. He encourages you to learn but does not do too much too fast. His voice, the music, and the setting are all perfect. I look forward to the day when I can advance to his next level CD.",1315094400,,624,3.727272727272727

The CD is useless as a Tai Chi instruction guide. Too bad because the moves appear to be the basic moves in the art. I am totally disappointed. Too bad. Scott is a master of Tai Chi and I looked forward to starting serious study. The poor rating is based solely on a production problem, not the skill of Scott Cole. I found that the cost of returning the CD is not cost effective. Disappointed in Amazon because this is my first bad purchase.",1312070400,,590,4.372727272727273
3711254,4,B001N4K6LU,"I have been doing Tai Chi for almost 2 years now and most of the time I did so by watching Scott Cole's ""Discover Tai Chi for Beginners"" dvd.  Its been extremely helpful in getting me acquainted with the art of tai chi and has really helped me feel and understand my body.  I can practically do the routines in my sleep..so last week I decided to see if there was anything more advanced or elaborate for me to move forward with.. so I decided to give this DVD a try.

As many people wrote, it seems as if the movements are rushed and hard to follow.  For someone that has no knowledge of tai chi, I would agree.  However, I would say this dvd is not really intended for beginners or someone just looking to get in to Tai Chi.. but rather for someone looking to take their Tai Chi study a bit further. Some of the movements might ""feel"" rushed, but you also have to give yourself time to learn them.. getting frustrated and anxious is not part of the tai chi practice.  Since many of the movements are similar to those found in the Beginners DVD, I had no problem transitioning right off the bat.  It has been nothing short of exceptional for me in the past few days.. as my tai chi workout has started to really blossom to a whole new level.  After my workout, I feel rejuvinated, refreshed and really ready to take on the day.

So I would not recommend this dvd for beginners..but I do recommend it for everyone after you have gained some knowledge of tai chi.",1307923200,,1461,4.2644927536231885

Imagine my surprise when I found that it is selling for over $50.  But I saw that they rerecorded it in 2009 for a reasonable sale price and I ordered it.  It is the identical DVD except that the first one I received had a very distracting audio hiss that is evident every few minutes.  I returned that one and got a second DVD and it has the identical hiss.  Must be something in the rerecording process.  Disappointing.",1307577600,,595,4.4036697247706424

We started to watch it so we could see what we were getting into, and my mom jumped off the couch and started doing the stances. It was lots of fun. It's pretty easy and repetitive, but you do feel like you're getting a workout, albeit a low-impact one. I would be interested to delve deeper into Tai Chi.
A word of caution: at the end of the first sequence, Scott sort of does this free-form Tai Chi. Just move around with it and wait for the next sequence to start.",1299024000,,633,4.072
3711259,5,B001N4K6LU,"I absolutely love this dvd (tai chi for weight loss). But first let me say that I purchased Scott Cole's Tai Chi for Beginners and have been doing it for about 6 weeks. It is so relaxed I find myself closing my eyes as I do the exercises - which is great for relaxation and has done wonders for my back. After having done the Beginners dvd for 6 weeks (almost daily), I decided I wanted to step up to the intermediate level and learn a bit more. As an intermediate level dvd by Scott Cole doesn't seem to exist, I went with this dvd just to try something else he's done (I like his teaching style) - and I love it. I understand what the other reviewers are saying and they are right - if you haven't done tai chi before this is not the dvd for you. If I hadn't already had almost all of these movements down from the beginner dvd, I would have had a hard time following it. As it is, it is an absolutely perfect addition to my tai chi/execise routine - it's just stenuous enough that your heart gets going and you develop a light sweat, but not overwhelming. I haven't quite been able to follow every move yet, but after a few more times through the dvd, it'll be no problem. I will use the beginner dvd for my evening relaxation stretching, and this dvd for my morning wake up energizing workout. I have also done the am/pm tai chi dvd, but don't like it as well as the beginner's dvd - the movements on the am/pm are almost all the same as on the beginners dvd, but the camera angles are often on his face or arms and not on the full body so you can't see the fully correct movement.",1296777600,,1585,4.116129032258065

The movements are all almost the same as on the beginners' DVD with a few extras. Unless you are already familiar with these movements, it might be a bit challenging knowing how to do them. His instruction on this DVD is a bit rushed.

Even though I am somewhat familiar with the movements, I still felt rushed. The idea is to do the movements slowly at first and then at an increased tempo. It got my heart rate up slightly, but mostly, I felt some strain on my knees doing these movements in a hurry.

I choose to do Tai Chi for the enjoyment of the movements, tranquility and flow. This DVD will not provide that.",1281571200,,718,4.311111111111111

He takes you through a series of exercises, which in my opinion are too complicated to get the first time and he teaches them.  Then the video changes to him doing them very fast, not giving any more instructions and not even telling you which exercise is next so it's up to you to remember the exact way to do the exercise, and remember when to change to the next one.  Complete waste of money in my opinion.  The Tai Chi for Beginners was much better, but still pretty boring.

I believe that the more advanced a person is with tai-chi, the less they will get out of it. I experienced many benefits of watching Scott Cole. I am more flexible, more relaxed, and the video has improved my reflexes and reaction. Saying this, I feel that a person with experience may not get many benefits out of it. If you are a beginner or have limited experience with Tai-chi, this is a great video. If you have many years experience, I would say to get a video that shows forms in their complete forms.

There's also a Special Features choice on the menu where Scott shows a number of other moves, one selection with instruction and another selection with music. I'd love to see him put all those moves together, but I guess that's a subject for another DVD.

As he begins each step, Cole describes the movements very clearly and slowly. I also appreciate the mental imagery that he suggests each step looks like or represents.

I decided to try 'Discover Tai Chi for Weight Loss.' To my disappointment, he rushes through the movements, without much explanation. I understand that the DVD is to make the viewer/participant move & sweat to lose weight--but I felt like I was in a race, no matter how much I slowed down the DVD to try to figure out each movement. This DVD is meant for beginners or at the very most, intermediates, so it shouldn't have felt that way.

This video has lots of moves and is well put together, but it's tough to just follow in a ""do this first, do this second"" mode.  Also, while the instructor shows everything just fine, it might have been helpful to have other participants at a different angle doing the moves at the same time. For example, I have some yoga disks that have the class facing you and the teacher facing sideways and I realize how helpful that is having seen a disk with just one instructor.
