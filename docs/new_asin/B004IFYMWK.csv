4386324,5,B004IFYMWK,"This is a movie that cogently describes a true event, not fiction or sci fi but real domestic espionage directed at our own patriotic US agents for the sole purpose of discrediting them at all costs to protect political corruption and perfidy regardless of the consequences or collateral damage. Such is the attitude of political operatives like Karl Rove who believe that the end justifies the means regardless of laws, justice, or common human decency.
Because this movie relates to the nefarious activities of Rove and his Bush Administration affiliates, this movie was immediately restricted to a handful of theaters around the country and so far even its DVD release date has been delayed. Had this movie been about the glories of Sarah Palin or exalting the delusional pathology of Glenn Beck, it would have been in every theater on every block of every town plus downloaded on every iPod.

Nixon's Watergate scandals pale in comparison to what the Cheney-Bush regime got away with and the joke is on the American people who have been enscorcelled by Fox News and their sociopaths. What this does prove is one thing beyond any reasonable doubt, don't fool with the Oligarchs! By the way, they DO fly heavy on their right wing:-)
The pity of this all is, as Rod Serling once said ""this is not confined to the Twilight Zone"".",1294963200,6,1329,4.828947368421052
4386325,4,B004IFYMWK,"A thriller with real teeth, this film presents a barely fictionalized account of events related to how the Bush administration apparently lied on a massive, perhaps criminally reprehensible, scale regarding Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program, seeking justification for America's going to war with Iraq.

One of the most interesting things about Fair Game, for me, is how an entertainment based on actual events cycles back to continue the ""real-world"" narrative  that gave rise to it.

The film actually further pursues husband-and-wife Valerie Plame and Joseph Wilson's counterattack against those in George W. Bush's administration who deliberately leaked Plame's status as a covert CIA operative to discredit her husband, formerly an Africa expert with the State Department, who had gone public with the news that the US government was lying about Iraq having imported large quantities of ""yellow cake"" uranium from Niger.

The film weaves together excellent acting by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, in the roles of Plame and Wilson, with network video footage of Bush and Cheney spinning the grounds for going to war, as well as with other documentary material I won't reveal for fear of spoiling its impact. Fair Game has no compunction about using these names as well as those of Karl Rove and Scooter Libby. There's a heady tone of, ""Okay, these people, whom we're naming flat out--this is no time for coyness--appear to be liars and pretty evil. So we say, and they can sue us if they dare.""

According to the storyline, not only did Bush/Cheney's spinmeisters set out to destroy Plame and Wilson's careers and public reputations, they showed utter disregard for the lives of the many agents Plame was operating in countries such as Iraq, where Saddam's displeasure entailed brutal ends for agents and family members alike.

Through much of the story, Plame and Wilson are getting smeared by the bad guys. By film's end, however, their tough and principled refusal to back down is finally paying off.

Now the film itself presents a nicely self-referential continuation of their attempt to show that--even in this age of mass media and expert political manipulation of public perceptions--us little people can fight back. And we can resist partly by using similar instruments.

At this point, though, the cynic in me rears up and suggests it ain't so easy, and nowhere is it writ that the good guys have to win. How much will Fair Game serve, as surely it was intended, to alert the public to the basic amorality of many of our puppet masters? Hardly at all, I'll bet. More likely, those who were already true liberal believers will say, ""Right on, right on!"" while those who suckle their realities at the Fox News teat will dismiss Fair Game as just more consarned work of the Devil and his liberal minions. And never the twain will meet.

So the Republicans will win the US national election in two years, and China will loom at one end of the Tea Party negotiating table, other guests being North Korea as the dormouse and Iran as the March Hare. (Does anyone know where I can find a couple of affordable tickets off-planet? One way will do fine.)

Whatever. Did I mention the movie is also very entertaining?

4386326,5,B004IFYMWK,"Remember Joe Wilson, the man who called a US President a liar?

No, I don't mean the Congressman from South Carolina who shouted out a spontaneous ""You Lie!"" at President Barack Obama during the State of the Union address.  I'm referring to Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson who wrote a New York Times editorial entitled ""What I Didn't Find In Africa"" contradicting President George W. Bush regarding the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

""Fair Game"" relates to the latter Joe Wilson (played by Sean Penn), who served as a diplomat in Africa during the 1990's and was asked to visit Niger prior to the Iraqi war to determine if there was yellowcake uranium there. Ambassador Wilson did not find the uranium on his visit and when the President referred to the uranium being there, he wrote a contradiction.

As a result of that contradiction, Wilson's wife CIA agent Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) was determined to be 'fair game' by the Bush Administration. Her cover was blown and the operations she engaged in were all scrapped, including getting Iraqi nuclear scientists who had been involved in Iraq's nuclear program before it was destroyed during a previous US invasion and their families free from their war-torn country.

The film's a tightly paced combination spy thriller and domestic drama.  On one hand, you see the front page news of ""Plamegate"".  Valerie's discredited and her career is dismantled. She goes from being a well-traveled agent with highly critical projects to 'a secretary' or a 'low level flunky' depending on what you read.

On the other, you see the Wilson homelife unraveling. The idealistic Joe is counterpointed strongly by his realistic wife as the country turns against them both. They receive countless threats, to the point of Valerie having to remove her children from their home.

This investigation resulted in the case, US vs. Libby in which Vice President Dick Cheney's aide Scooter Libby was  tried on five federal felony counts. Libby was convicted on four of those charges, involving false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice, none of which related directly to the Plame revelation but rather to his failure to cooperate with the subsequent investigation into the revelation. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and a fine of $250,000. President Bush subsequently commuted Libby's sentence.

4386328,5,B004IFYMWK,"If you are about to watch this because you think it is a spy thriller, it is not.  Please do not watch it and then give low ratings for this thought-provoking biographical/historical drama.  This is a story about integrity and loyalty versus corruption. It is a ""Washington Gone Wrong"" kind of story.

The lead actors were well chosen to represent the real life family that this happened to.  Like the real Plame, Naomi Watts does not look like a CIA operative but more like a corporate executive. Penn is a great choice because, based on his public persona, he seems to be as stubborn and full of righteous indignation as the man he depicts here.

It took me a few weeks to finish watching this movie. It was just difficult to watch because I already knew that the inhumanity depicted here was perpetrated on real people. While watching I discovered that other lives were destroyed, not just those we heard about on the news here at home but also in Iraq. These were scientists under 'our protection', which is something I had not heard of before, but which other viewers may already know of.

The scene with Penn and the taxi driver from Sierra leone is provocative in the way it asks viewers to rethink their beliefs about corruption.

Inside this particular story there was and will always be little to redeem the administration. As a history of government and intelligence communities, the particular events depicted in this movie understandably unfold from the point of view of the righteous among them, and that happens to be the Wilsons.  I say this in response to those reviewers who gave low ratings because they felt that the story failed to present the point of view of the Bush administration.

Lastly, I think that the Media got away with it in this story. Probably due to time constraints, we did not delve into the negative role that key players in the media played in bringing down the Wilsons, especially Robert Novak who revealed Plame's identity, and others who ""uncovered"" derogatory pieces of ""information"" about the Wilsons that later turned out to be untrue.

4386338,4,B004IFYMWK,Just quick note on some of the other reviews.

4386364,5,B004IFYMWK,"I purchased this film 7 years after it has been in the theaters . It was advertised as in the genre of a political thriller. It is much more than that. It is a true eye opener on leadership, manipulation of our sacred press and trust. Based on the actual experiences of CIA "" OPERATIVE"" (NOC, STATION leader in charge of intel on WMD in Iraq) and her husband ex ambassador to Niger(not Nigeria). These roles were played to near perfection by Naomi Watts playing Valerie Plame Wilson and Sean Penn playing Joe Wilson. The commentators to the film were the Wilsons and they were just amazed at how well these actors captured themselves down to their mannerisms. The acting and production alone is worth five stars. The actual story is very frightening on how a political agenda can manipulate the press and the people of a country. It makes you wonder how often this occurs.
In the film GREEN ZONE the on site cia operative(B. GLEESON) tried to explain that there are no WMD in Iraq. The political advisor(G.KINEAR) contradicted this notion by leaking false info to the press. After seeing Fair Game you will find how wide your eyes are opened to this dilemma. This is not a film about the right or wrong in being in Iraq but just how we got there and the steps taken to do so. Valerie Plame if you remember 2003 was outed as a CIA employee by a government official of very high office just to discredit her husband who claimed very different circumstances surrounding the invasion of Iraq. Punish an agent just discredit her husband, Wow ! An outed agent puts every contact he/she ever made in severe jeopardy as well as their families. There are laws that prohibit such an outing by government employees just for that reason. Yet it happened. The whys and hows are explained in the film and you are left feeling betrayed as a patriotic citizen.
Couple the watching of this film with the Green Zone and you will have some questions to ask yourself. The invasion of Iraq is really not in question but the extent that our leaders were willing to go to get there is.",1489881600,4,2062,4.53083109919571

4386378,4,B004IFYMWK,"It is a rather odd circumstance when I am rooting for a CIA agent to win, or at least get out from under what burden he or she is facing. Not that I wish any particular harm but the agency as a whole is usually in my sights for criticism for its nefarious activities. Those activities, as highlighted in the film under review Fair Game about the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame over her assessments about the rationale for the Iraq War (the one started officially in 2003 not the earlier one in 1991 although there is a connection about the fate of the Saddams weapons of mass destruction, WMD, that link the two together) including some very shady dealings around the lead-up to the war in 2002. Although that agency was hardly the prime culprit for that disastrous war policy that we are still paying for in cash, lives, including innocent Iraqi citizen lives, and for arbitrary use of military power that had made the world cringe before and has since the initial phase of the military campaign was completed.
Valerie Plame Wilson was a career CIA operative whose tasks included checking up on the bad guys who were looking to get nuclear weapons for jihad or whatever purpose bad guys were looking for powerful weapons. In the post-9/11 world that task took on greater importance as the American government under President Bush was looking for a rationale to blast Iraqs dictator and nemesis Saddam off the map as part of the overall national security plan to thwart the international terrorist cabals. The Bush administration (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, et al) were looking for any evidence that Saddam had his WMD program still intact after 1991. So even the slightest evidence that would physically prove that he was still pursuing his program was welcome-they would spin whatever tidbits they had once they got a bite.

One big piece of evidence that was making the rounds, the thing that got Valerie, played by Naomi Waits, and her ex-ambassador husband, Joe Wilson, played by Sean Penn was yellowcake uranium, lots of it, allegedly being sought by the Iraqis from Niger in Africa. During the lead-up to the war the CIA hired Joe, who had contacts in the area, in Niger, to verify if possible that trail. Joes conclusion: the purchase didn't exist, nada, nothing of the kind. Of course that conclusion when the CIA kicked it upstairs died a quiet death. Lost amount a million other things in the welter of war. The administration had buried the information deep in some hole and had spun a whole different unture tale and Joe was ticked off about it.

As the disastrous policy in Iraq unfolded Joe Wilson, who had connections in the press, wrote an op-ed article about his true findings in Niger concerning the yellowcake. Then all hell broke loose. Administration officials were running for cover, guys like Karl Rove and Scooter Libby in particular. A little trick they played to get even was to out Valerie Plume. A no-no. A no-no as far as federal law went and a no-no as far as Joe Wilson was concerned. While Valerie was the good soldier keeping quiet despite her being kicked out of the agency Joe was determined to find the culprits who did his wife and her career in. And he succeeded, or at least had the satisfaction to see somebody take the fall (Scooter Libby who was subsequently sentenced and pardoned for his crimes). A small victory against the big boys by an average citizen. That part is to the good. Still I am a little uneasy about having had to raise my fist and say well done Joe and Valerie.

4386412,4,B004IFYMWK,"Only her husband, Joe Wilson, and her parents knew the true identity of Valerie's alias. To begin, the office of the Vice President received a report concerning a memorandum of the sale between the governments of Niger (not to be confused with Nigeria) and Iraq for the purchase of 500-tons of yellowcake uranium ore. Yellowcake uranium is a concentrate from uranium ore used as fissile material in weapons. Niger has two uranium mines in the Sahara desert. One is not in operation and the other is run by COGEMA, a French subsidiary, jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans. Ambassador Joe Wilson knew the country well, because he started his foreign service there. He had visited it many times as Ambassador to Gabon and then again as Director of Africa Policy for President Clinton with NSC. He often met with Prime Minister Mayaki, and he knew the former Foreign Minister and the Minister of Mines. Five hundred tons of yellowcake represents 40 percent of the nation's annual output of uranium. A sale that size would leave a huge paper trail. Any documentation would, by law, require the signatures of the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Minister of Mines. Joe Wilson travelled there to investigate and spoke with these connections. He determined the sale could not have happened which is not what the Administration wanted to hear. He was expected to toe the line and by whatever deceitful means to support the Vice President's apocryphal supposition that Iraq, Saddam Hussein's government, was acquiring the fissile material needed to develop a nuclear capability. As a retaliatory, criminal act, on July 14, 2003, Valerie Plame's name as a CIA agent was published in the widely read Novak syndicated column. This jeopardized the lives of people in the field in critical stages of operations, 8 to 9 teams, in Kuala Lumpar, Mumbai, and Dubai. And in a crucial operation in Baghdad, at least two scientists, Falli and Hubbuk, were killed working on Valerie's behalf. Karl Rowe escaped indictment, but Lewis Scooter Libby was convicted and sentenced to two and a half years in prison and a $250,000 fine. President Bush used his executive authority to commute the court's sentence. In 2006, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage admitted to being a source of the leak.",1465862400,,2291,5.015748031496063
4386413,3,B004IFYMWK,"Time has a way of changing how things are viewed.  This movie would have been good if portrayed as a documentary but it was promoted as an action film and falls way short.  While at the time that these events unfolded the then President Bush may have not had concrete evidence of WNDs in Iraq and was vilified by such just the last few years have shown that that was actually a true statement.

While the characters in this movie were plausible and likeable the movie itself seemed to drag on and on and after seeing the previews and buying it based on those the movie fell short in what it actually delivered.  Good story..........yes.  Good acting...........yes again.  Enjoyable movie..........barely.  Became tedious after a certain point and simply watchable to finally get to the conclusion to make your time investment pay off.

Sean Penn was brilliant as he always is showing with small nuances huge inner conflicts, pain, angst and fear.

One must really watch this movie to even begin to see all the various intricacies of this terribly unjust yet disturbingly true account of betrayal by the highest branch of our government over those that work to protect our rights and this country.

Please Note:  At the bottom of this DVD Movie, there are four choices and of course the first is simply to play movie.  However, there is a great verbal discussion by Valerie and Joe Wilson as they review and comment of the movie, plus different things that were happening during those different time periods to each of them separately and to all of us as a nation.  We usually don't bother with these extras like scenes, etc. because after all, we've seen them already when we viewed the movie.  But the one extra one I've just finished watching again for the 2nd time, is so educational and contains so much more detail as it is being discussed in the casual ongoing conversation between Valerie and Joe.  I can never now say I don't really know them after experiencing this.  Exceptional people and educators that I would naturally gravitate toward if I'd ever known them in any other area of their lives,  So like ""us"" as we all function daily in our own families, work & home lives.

4386544,5,B004IFYMWK,"This is an entertaining film and also a fascinating picture of the lengths that the Bush White House would go to discredit challenges to the faulty evidence of weapons of mass destruction on which White House policy makers were making their case for an invasion of Iraq. This film does a good job of showing how the White House insiders put pressure on the CIA to cherry pick data so as to build a case for invasion of Iraq. While at the same time former Ambassador Joe Wilson was unraveling their evidence and case, for which he and his wife Valerie Plame paid a price.

Naomi Watts plays the role of Valerie Plame, a CIA agent whose cover is blown by the Bush White House in retaliation for her husbands evidence and sound arguments that the Iraqis did not have weapons of mass destruction or were building weapons of mass destruction. Now in hindsight it appears that several White House operatives were responsible for the leak to Robert Novak that Plame worked for the CIA and that the CIA had asked Joe Wilson to investigate claims that shipments of yellow-cake uranium were being shipped to Iraq for refinement into weapons.

Sean Penn does an excellent job of playing the outspoken Ambassador Joe Wilson who wrote an editorial in the New York Times challenging the truth of a statement in President Bushs state of the union address. So the film deals with politics, spies and the pressure placed upon Plame and Wilson that caused considerable tension in their marriage.  Some of the most insightful aspects of the film was the work of Plame as a CIA agent in contacting Iraqi nuclear scientists to determine whether there might be some authenticity to the assertions around weapons development by Sadam Hussein.

The film is very entertaining. The acting by Penn and Watts is first rate. The historic significance of these events is still being felt. The film reminds us that American men and women, along with countless Iraqi citizens, died in an invasion based upon faulty evidence misinterpreted by an over-eager White House.",1390348800,,2036,4.808571428571429

4386546,5,B004IFYMWK,"I just finished watching the outstanding 2010 dramatic film Fair Game. the film tells the infamous story of how the corrupt Bush administration outted CIA agent Valerie Plame in retaliation for her husband Joe Wilsons courageous exposure of the faked Niger connection (which Bush used as a pretense for war with Iraq). Needless to say, Sean Penn and Naomi Watts are outstanding as Wilson and Plame (and it doesnt hurt that they look quite similar to Wilson and Plame.)

While political intrigue films generally have a hard time holding my attention, Fair Game was engrossing from beginning to end, a story of amoral pragmatism met by moral gusto. For me the pivotal moment comes in the kitchen of their family home: Valerie wants Joe to shut up because of the harm it is bringing on their family (remember, this is the same time that the Dixie Chicks were receiving death threats for expressing their frustration with George Bush). But Joe won't back down: apparently Joe didn't realize that the old adage You cant fight city hall applied to the White House as well. Heres how the dialogue unfolds:

Valerie: You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win? Theyll bury us.

Joe: Theyll bury us if we dont. Listen Valerie.

Valerie: No you listen to me.

Joe (shouting): No, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie! Do I, does that make me right if I shout louder than you? If I shout louder than you am I right? If Im the White House and I shout a million times louder than you, does that make me right? They lied Valerie, they lied. Thats the truth.

President Bush Jr. was so obsessed with invading Iraq to finish the war that his father had started that he fabricated the story that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. CIA operative Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) is sent to Iraq under cover to find out the truth. She persuades several of the Iraqi physicists involved in the program to defect to America. She makes it clear back home however that there are no WMD. Her partner, Joe Wilson (Sean Penn), writes a newspaper article about the fiasco but in return the administration discloses Valerie's identity and the nature of her mission. The Iraqi physicists are abandoned to their fate in Iraq and they are rounded up and executed. The chief `hawk' in the administration is Scooter Libby (David Andrews) who subsequently stands trial for his part in the fabrication, and is sentenced, but has his sentence revoked by the president. The movie is an exciting dramatization of events, directed by Doug Liman.

The point of the film is to show how the Bush administration illegally broke the cover of a CIA agent (whether she was a good agent or not is also not the point) to get revenge on any who stood in their way. In this case, her husband who was exposing the bare-faced lies that the Bush administration was using to start the Iraq war, a war that wasn't and still isn't in this country's best interests (just like Vietnam). Another detractor asked if Libby is always sneering. Of course he was as was Bush, Cheney, and other of Bush's Gauleiters to show their contempt for the people who elected (and stupidly re-elected) this bunch of criminals. It's too bad this movie wasn't released while George ""Dubious"" was still in office altho he'd probably have had to have someone to explain it to him. Or Cheney, Rove, and Libby would've gone after the studio, director, and writers.

That is, it's not afraid to portray the United States government as the corrupt organization it often is. The main focus goes back to the weeks, months and years after ""9-11 and the questionable war that started as a result. But the plot, which plays around Valerie's sudden termination from the CIA; the result of her ambassador husband publically denying that Saddam Hussein is using ""yellowcake"" to make weapons; doesn't really untangle itself until about the half-way point. From there, this Fair Game is two people versus the government in what is ultimately anything but.

4386582,4,B004IFYMWK,"Fair Game is based on the true story of CIA agent Valerie Plame, who shares some of the qualities exhibited by Gary Oldham's character in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Both are stunningly skilled operatives.  Most of the story you know:  The Bush administration had decided to go to war in Iraq.  Seeking reasons to justify an attack, it seized on a report that the nation of Niger (not Nigeria) had sold uranium to Iraq.  Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador to Niger, was sent to seek such evidence.  He found none.  In fact, he learned that such sales would have been physically impossible.  His report was ignored.  War was begun using the nonexistent uranium sales as cause.  He wrote an article in the New York Times reporting the truth.  In order to discredit him, someone in the administration leaked the information to Chicago Sun-Times columnist Robert Novak that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA agent.  Eventually, Cheney aide, Scooter Libby, was tried and convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury, sentenced to prison, and had his sentence commuted by Bush.  The part of the story you probably do not know was the ""collateral"" damage.  Plame's sensitive work in the Middle East was disrupted and as many as 70 of her informants were killed.  The Plame-Wilson family (including young twins) came close to breakup.
Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are excellent as Plame and Wilson, even looking remarkably like them.  The film does not change the names of any principals, uses actual footage of administrative figures, and even closes with footage of Plame herself testifying before congress.  Here are a couple of ifs:  If Wilson had kept quiet, Plame's CIA work wouldn't have been destroyed.  On the other hand, if the Bush administration hadn't suppressed Wilson's information and smeared Wilson and Plame, there might have been no Iraq War.

The story is well-known and is dramatized very well in this film.

 President Bush insisted that the US should bomb Iraq because the country has weapons of mass destruction. A retired American ambassador was asked by the CIA to look into the matter and found that this was not true. President Bush ignored the CIA finding and insisted that Iraq had such weapons and had the US military attack Iraq. The ambassador published an article in a newspaper stating that there were no such weapons. The White House admitted that he was correct, but childishly and inappropriately struck back at the ambassador by illegally revealing that his wife was an undercover CIA agent. The film shows how this White House action destroyed the innocent woman's career, placed great strains upon her marriage, and forced the CIA to abandon the non-American agents that worked under her, many of whom lost their lives.",1337644800,2,1285,4.917050691244239

However, it is clear that the film has little to do with real world events and more to do with how Sean Penn truly relates with the world, i.e., from a lofty perch where he makes presumptuous and pompous decrees and judgments. Halfway through the film, when the Plames begin having marital problems and the plot moved closer to an accurate portrayal of the actual historical events, I had hope that the film would end on this high note. However, we are only left with another slump into the realm of Penn's perception of reality.

With the exception of Watergate, I can't remember another movie that shows the corruption that abounds within the highest-of-the-high executive offices of our government. This is the story of how a CIA agent was outed and her husband's reputation smeared because he publicly exposed a blatant lie regarding shipment of material to Iraq from Africa. The lie was being used by the Bush Administration to help draw us into a war with Iraq.

If you watch television at all you know the lead characters in this film. Valerie Plame, former CIA agent and her former ambassador husband,Joseph Wilson, played by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. They played their parts with great skill and insight.

The movie is a thriller and tells the story very well. The V.P. and his aide Mr. Libby,(Scooter) to those who are his friends, are all there.  The aftermath of Valerie's outing comes to life and the suspense builds.

When I saw this DVD in the video store, it had completely missed my radar screen.  The film will be controversial for some because of the politics and the historical recency of the Bush administration and the Iraq war.  As a film, it has been derided because of its emphasis on the relationship between Wilson and his wife.  While my perception is that the film balances well between the politics and intrigue of the Iraq War and the home situation, it is made FAR more interesting because it so greatly points out the impact the events had on a real family.  It also points to the value of the individual to stand up and say what is true in a democracy; reference the scene Sean Penn addresses a class at the end.  Sean Penn is a Master actor.  I never would have predicted this when I watched ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" but with the choices he has made and the incredible diversity from performances in ""Milk,"" ""I Am Sam"" and ""Mystic River,"" now I ALWAYS watch his work.

In this case, particularly in Joe Wilson's case, things just didn't add up. He KNEW that the information was not only cooked, it was completely fabricated. There's a lot more unsaid in this story, and countless others that occurred during the Cheney years. There's a reason he can't leave the US.

I also recommend the Pentagon Papers, a fine movie dealing with the Ellsberg case.

4386606,5,B004IFYMWK,"The video and audio on this blu ray are excellent. What really bears comment if the film itself.  ""Fair Game"" is the true story of Valarie Plame Wilson, a covert CIA agent and her husband, former ambassador  Joe Wilson.  Leading up to the 2003 war in Iraq, was the concern that Saddam Hussein was gearing up to produce nuclear weapons.  And at the request of the Vice President's office, the CIA asked Joe Wilson to go on a fact finding trip to Niger (the presumed location of the purchase by Iraqi agents of a form of uranium called ""yellow cake"").  Wilson was previously an ambassador under Presidents GHW Bush and Clinton and knew the area well. His findings were in fact that rumors of such purchases were false and he reported such.

When GW Bush launched the war against Iraq, the rationale was based principally on the Iraqi possession of such weapons of mass destruction.  When that lie was perpetuated by Bush in his State of the Union address (the now infamous ""sixteen words""), Joe Wilson spoke out in a Op-ed piece in the Washington Post.  And from that point on, members of the Bush administration, from Dick Cheney on down, sought to discredit Joe Wilson by exposing his wife (Valarie Plame Wilson) as a covert CIA operative.  And they further attempted to assassinate the character and reputation of both by claiming that his wife had sent Joe Wilson on the trip as a junket.

The official records are now clear (after the Fitzgerald investigation and the indictment of Scooter Libby) that Joe Wilson was telling the truth as he exposed one of the biggest lies in the history of U.S. foreign policy one that lead to biggest foreign policy disaster since the Vietnam war----namely the Iraqi war.  Libby was convicted of  lying and obstruction of justice.  Bush took care of his own by commuting Libby's sentence, but he did not pardon him.

Her story is unprescedented in a sense that her husband's outspoken nature caused the US high level officials to reveal her identity as a CIA covert agent and directly put in danger not only her family, but also the contacts she groomed in 18 years of her career as a CIA agent.

I have not read the book, but I did follow the events regarding this political scandal.  In any case, I enjoyed the portrayal of Joe Wilson a man of strong convictions who is standing his ground and defending his ideals.  It is not often one seems a middle aged man, with family, standing his ground when it comes to his political ideas.  I do not believe that Joe Wilson ever believed that government officials would take their anger and disapproval of his conduct so harshly to destroy both of their careers and almost their marriage.  In a movie,  Penn portrays Wilson as a wise and rational man and I must admit I am less impresed with Plame's character (not Watt's performance though).  I found Plame to be naive and even silly at times and her take that her job ""pays the bills"" did not convince me of undying loyalty to either country, or her family for that matter.  After watching the movie both issues almost seem like a fallback after she lost it all.

4386619,5,B004IFYMWK,"Some have compared this film to ""All the President's Men"", which told of the travails of the intrepid reporters who unraveled the Watergate scandal.

There's one large and tragic difference between that story and the one told in ""Fair Game"".  Watergate forced Richard Nixon to resign his office in disgrace.  The treasonous activities perpetrated by Bush, Cheney, and their cronies have had all but no repercussions.

Bush now makes thousands speaking at company functions.  Cheney is about to release a book justifying his misdeeds.  And Bush commuted the sentence of the one guy who took a fall for the ""Plamegate"" scandal, Cheney's operative Scooter Libby.

Make no mistake.  The story told in ""Fair Game"" captures one of the darkest hours in American history.  The leaders of our nation launched a war of aggression on another country, attempting to justify their actions based on the flimsiest web of false information.

When one courageous citizen, former ambassador Joe Wilson, spoke out about the campaign of deceit waged by the White House, the White House exposed his wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA operative, and attempted to discredit the couple in a wave of lies and vitriol that lasted four long years.

Any American, either on the right or left, who cares about ""truth, justice, and the American way"" should be outraged and disgusted by what went on here.  This movie does a valuable service in dramatizing and focusing a complicated story obscured in real life by the fog of disinformation into a taut hour-and-forty-five minute drama.

This DVD also brings more to the story than the original theatrical release, because the disc includes illuminating commentary by Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame.  Their testimony gives the film a stamp of unimpeachable veracity unlike the flim flam concocted by the Bush administration in its helter-skelter runup to the Iraq War.

Happily, the couple now seem happy and proud of their courageous actions, but they also remark how watching the film brings back some terrible recollections, especially when they see the footage the film contains of the warmongers spewing their pathetic lies on camera.

Bush, Cheney, Peter King, Condoleeza Rice, and others should all be ashamed and shunned for the rest of their lives by all true Americans.

The performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn as the embattled couple are impeccable, and indeed Plame and Wilson both say what accurate portrayals of themselves are on display here.

In my opinion, this film should be required viewing by all school children here in the United States for generations to come.  And for those families whose loved ones gave the ultimate sacrifice in that unjust war, one can only feel the deepest of sympathy.",1307318400,16,2734,5.0625

If this were not a 'true' story, its subject could be defined as: how much risk do we need to take to fight for truth and against abuse of power? Is truth in the public sphere worth damaging our personal life?
As this film is a rather literal transposal of 'real' events into a story on the screen, the question becomes another one: why is a president who fabricated a pretext in order to drag his country and indirectly much of the world into a war of aggression, not being prosecuted for his criminal acts while in office?  and why do the one-star-reviewers, who take the film for its political face value, not comment on the truth question? is it irrelevant to them?

4386624,4,B004IFYMWK,"Based upon the true story of a CIA agent's encounter with politics, Fair Game is a suspenseful tale about the career of Valerie Plame and her eventual struggle with the US government.  Naomi Watts does an excellent job playing Plame and Sean Penn is outstanding as her husband, diplomat Joe Wilson.

The CIA had been watching Iraq for several years.  During the war in Afghanistan, a rumor surfaced suggesting that Iraq was seeking material to make nuclear weapons.  The Vice President sent his chief of Staff to the CIA to learn if Iraq was a threat to peace.

Due to the White House request, CIA leaders asked Joe Wilson, a former US Ambassador in Africa, to travel to Africa and use his contacts to discover whether Niger actually supplied Iraq with yellow-cake uranium.  Joe agrees to take an informal trip to Niger, at his own expense, to learn whatever he could.

Valerie's husband Joe gets her in trouble.  Ambassador Wilson travels to Africa and finds that the report about Niger selling nuclear material is false.  After the President, in his State of the Union address, contends that Iraq obtained weapons grade uranium from Niger, he writes a newspaper article that challenges the President's word.  The White House reacts by attacking Joe and Valerie, and releasing to the press that Valerie is a CIA agent.  Being exposed, Valerie loses her effectiveness as a agent and is fired from the CIA.  Joe's actions, whether seen as heroic or foolish, hurt his relationship with Valerie and threatened their marriage.

The film enhances Plame's professionalism and integrity by picturing her on several overseas missions as an active and effective undercover operative.  She heads a team that engages in serious actions against foreign threats to the USA.  Valerie is loyal and totally professional.  Even when she is exposed, she insists on keeping silent about her activities and government secrets.

What really happened to Valerie Plame?  Why did the Vice President's chief of staff  reveal her identity and blow her CIA cover?  What did the CIA really know about Iraq and their weapons program?  Was Joe Wilson's outrage based upon truth or fraud.  This movie presents answers.

This is a good movie that does an excellent job of telling the story of Valerie Plame.  Fair Game is action packed, but also is politically charged.  I recommend this movie.",1306108800,5,2362,4.964285714285714
4386625,5,B004IFYMWK,"The real victim in this whole thing was Valerie Wilson who emerges as the sole class act in this whole affair. Okay so she co-wrote the book they based the movie upon.

he problem was not what Joe Wilson did, but his timing and lack of consultation with his wife. From the movie, he blind sided her with the article as well. He did not have the consideration or forethought to talk to her first, instead going off half-cocked seeking some sort of revenge. They Lied! Yeah, so what. If you are going to out them, wait until things die down and spring it in October right before the election. Wilson, while being patriotic was also portrayed as self-serving his ego. Albeit, he did not think Rove would out his wife, but he should have thought that far ahead. He needed to stop and think about his actions, which didn't save anyone and along with Rove's retaliation got people killed.

In spite of Joe Wilson's fight against the WH, Valerie remained true to her CIA rules of silence. She endures threats to her family and media smears. Joe goes on TV against his wife's wishes and she leaves home to stay with her parents.

4386626,1,B004IFYMWK,"The reason for this review is that the time out of your life for this horrible movie would be a shame. I am saving countless people from drivel.  The real plame story is amazing, and you should take the time to read the accounts of it, not this movie.  The movie has more contempt for the audience than a skin flik.  The director creates the outer trappings of a wonderfully exciting suspenseful movie.  However it never gives the viewer suspense or excitement and fails completely, instead reminding me of Michael's improv class in the Office.  The only exception would be if you turned off the voices ( and didn't turn on English subtitles ) and instead called a friend and watched the movie with only the music but not the words in one of your ear plugs with your friend on the other earplug.

Why? The story is never communicated as it really happened, so even if you know of the Plame affair, the director gave up a great real life story to maintain the cheap attempt of a cliche ridden suspenseful movie that never delivers at all.
So does this mean you get another story? No.  That's what makes this a big zero- the story is incomprehensible because there is none to be culled from the move itself.  Worst off, when what should count for suspense starts, you know what will ""kind"" of happen scene by scene as soon as you see the first 5 seconds of every scene, but no story still ever evolves. Whenever content is approached, it gives way to the opposite= to a vague allusion of what you are never told.  What could be worse than this?
Answer: everything else about the movie.  The characters emotions are ingested by us as totally contrived and faked and the viewer at every moment is thinking how a tenth grader making a movie is trying to add drama.

The actors are possibly good actors except the extent of the emotions is what you would expect from the Navy seals as they are about to enter Pakistani air space, too overreaching for what the actors are experiencing which is about at the level of what a viewer would experience were he/she to feel were he/she in a bad job feeling he/she was a month away from being fired.",1304812800,6,2134,4.460154241645244

4386635,5,B004IFYMWK,"Much of the rationale given by the Bush Administration for America going to war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein at the end of the winter of 2003 centered around claims made by British intelligence officials that Hussein's regime sought out mass quantities of yellowcake uranium from the country of Niger in western Africa.  Those claims had been put into the State of the Union speech that Bush had given in January of that year.  As it turned out, though, those claims, when thoroughly investigated, turned out to be untrue.  Subsequently, a high-level couple, ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife, CIA operative Valerie Plame, were outed by cronies inside the Bush White House and placed in the middle of a firestorm in which anyone attempting to discredit the Bush Administration in any small way was censured in the press.  It is their fight that was depicted in the 2010 film FAIR GAME.

Watts and Penn portray the real-life couple at the center of this firestorm.  Penn, as ambassador Wilson, investigates the claims about yellowcake uranium and aluminum tubing supposedly being used to make nuclear weapons being exported between Niger and Iraq back in the late 1990s, as it appears that America is on the brink of ousting Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.  Meanwhile, Watts, as Valerie Plame, makes it her business to get reliable sources of Iraq's intelligence out of there to give the CIA the proper information.  Penn asserts that such a trade of uranium not only could not have occurred, but that the aluminum tubing in question is not of the kind that would be suitable for doing what the Bush Administration says Hussein intends it for--to create a nuclear bomb.  Thus, the rationale for going to war in Iraq has just been rendered fraudulent, but a little too late for those Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers caught in the middle.  Even so, however, Watts' name and status are both exposed in the media from within the bowels of the administration, rendering her damaged goods, and infuriating Penn.

The other significant thing the whole imbroglio causes is a huge schism between the couple, since Watts is initially unwilling to fight back while Penn makes the rounds on the networks to tell the truth of the matter.  The allegations against both of them mount in the press, which keeps hounding them for their alleged lack of patriotism; and finally, both of them come out of the shadows to tell their side of the story.  Watts manages to make her decision after having a talk with her father (Shepherd), a veteran of the Vietnam War who, because of his military life, had to move both himself and his family to twenty different locales around the world and America.  And while they didn't come out of the imbroglio completely unscathed in the media, in the end, the Bush Administration and its minions didn't either.

Incisively directed by Doug Liman, who was responsible for the 2002 Robert Ludlum adaptation THE BOURNE IDENTITY, FAIR GAME is a powerful expose of the Iraq war as seen through the eyes and experiences of its most noted diplomatic figures, every bit as powerful a political film as any, documentary or otherwise, made since 9/11, and, indeed, every bit as thorough as films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THIRTEEN DAYS.  While there are political considerations to be considered in this film, especially give that Penn was one of the most ferocious and outspoken critics anywhere of the Bush Administation from the beginning, this is equally a hard-hitting character study as well; and Penn and Watts do an excellent job of portraying the beleaguered Wilsons, while a whole host of good character actors are superb in their roles of the dark underlings that work for Team Bush.  Liman, who also does the cinematography, shoots FAIR GAME in a very documentary-like style, and in the same bleached-color visuals that were a trademark of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, MINORITY REPORT, and MUNICH.

Both Valerie Plane and Joe Wilson risked everything they had to get the truth out there about the Bush Administration's dissembling with regards to a non-existent connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11; and FAIR GAME is an excellent film depicting that struggle, clearly one of the best films of 2010.",1303430400,3,4241,4.924263674614306

4386638,4,B004IFYMWK,"An excellent combination of true life thriller and drama ""Fair Game"" portrays what happened when CIA Agent Valerie Plame Wilson was ""outed"" after her husband Ambassador Joe Wilson wrote the New York Times editorial entitled ""What I Didn't Find In Africa"" questioning the discovery of material to make nuclear devices which provided part of the rational for President George W. Bush going to war in Iraq. What's fascinating about this dramatic thriller is that it recalls films like ""All the President's Men"" in terms of its matter-of-fact presentation and the reaction of our government to try and minimize or discredit people doing what they felt was right.

The resulting fall out (pun intended) resulted in his wife being exposed as an agent, putting those under her supervision and those she was trying to help as part of her ops at risk all for political gain. The result was that even Wilson himself faced accusations that he was lying for financial gain in the process. The resulting pressures nearly drove them apart destroying their lives all for the sake of saving face.

The film directed by Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") and written by Jez and John Henry-Butterworth but based on the book by Plame benefits from strong and authentic feeling performances by Naomi Watts as Plame and Sean Penn as Wilson.

The Blu-ray edition of the film features a strong looking, sharp transfer. Colors don't exactly pop but they aren't meant to here--the film is true to the original theatrical presentation in that regard but detail remains razor sharp throughout the presentation of the film. Audio is quite strong although keep in mind this is primarily a dialogue driven drama.

Unfortunately the only special feature included on the Blu-ray is a commentary track by Plame and Wilson and while it is a welcome addition, it would have been interesting to have licensed some of the news footage of Plame's actual testimony about the events that transpired. The duo admit that it's a bit weird commenting on a drama based on real life that they lived through (since there will be a certain amount of fictionalized elements to make it work as a film). It might have been better to have both of them discuss the making of the film with director Liman and comment on the process of life vs. film.

An engrossing drama, ""Fair Game"" reminds us all that there are real casualities when personal reputations are attacked as part of a political cover up. I imagine that your reaction to the film may be influenced also by your politics as well although given what occurred it shouldn't. What was done to Plame, Wilson and those that depended on them was wrong.

everyone watching it.

I have two problems with this movie.

The first is that although it is based on a true story,
it is a version of reality created by the director.  In
order to distill the story into two hours he has to
make decisions on what to include and exclude.

The second problem I have is that there really is nothing
new in this film.

Was there an intelligence failure?  According to this movie,
yes of course, but on the part of the administration.  The
CIA agents work under very dangerous situations to help
this country.  It is illegal to blow agents cover by a law
passed by the elder Bush.  The irony here is that the younger
Bush was trying to get around the same law.  :)

About blowing a cover of a CIA agent, the elder Bush said
it best.  In his own words:

I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray
the trust by exposing the name of [CIA] sources. They are,
in my view, the most insidious, of traitors.

The subject that almost breaks up their marriage is whether Valerie sent Joe to Niger to prove the Bush Adminstration a fraud on the war with Iraq. She didn't. Wilson found no evidence that that country (which the Bush Administration cannot even pronounce correctly) had shipped uranium to Sadam Hussein with which to make nuclear weapons.  They could not even get it out of the ground! and would not recognise it if they saw it. The turning point in the film is when a delivery boy flips a daily newspaper on their drive, which ""outs"" Valerie as the CIA agent who sent Joe to Niger (no luxury there) and allowed the Bush administration to start a war which continues to this day. He wrote an essay the title  of which was ""What I Did Not Find in Niger.""

We follow Valerie's heartbreak after she is fired for the supposed leak from a job she loved. The family, with two small twins, starts to crumble. Eventually they find the Libby-Armitage connection to the leak to Bob Novak, a Republican journalist (though I don't recall hearing his name mentioned in the film, probably because he's dead now anyway). If anyone doubts that the Bush Administration was the worst in history, he or she need only see this movie. The one reviewer who gave it a one-star rating is undoubtedly a Republican. Bush, Cheney, and Rice all make cameo appearances as they speak the words that got us into the Iraq mess in which innocent civilians and soldiers lost their lives. Valerie and Joe moved to Santa Fe where I met both. I tried to convince Joe to run for governor, but he declined citing too much public service already. I don't blame him if Bush-Cheney are the epitome of public service. A fine film about political corruption.  John K. Crane. Santa Fe",1301961600,3,1987,4.639204545454546

After finding out the White House was behind the outing her husband, Joe tries to take on the government.  This will be a hard movie for me to review.  I really enjoyed it, I love movies that spark debate, but it will be hard to keep my personal political views out of it.  This is another movie (there seems to be a lot lately) that because of a low budget and no explosions doesn't get the studio support that it deserves in order to get a wide release.  The performances are great.  Naomi Watts really steals the movie, which is hard to do opposite Sean Penn.  I really do recommend this movie, but it has the capability of polarizing people so be warned.  This is definatly a movie that will have you talking long after the movie is over.  I give it a B+.

4386646,5,B004IFYMWK,"FAIR GAME serves several purposes; it is a thriller of a suspense movie that entertains, it addresses one of the most controversial aspects of American military action in years, and it dares to open the secret doors of the Bush Administration.  Based on the book 'The Politics of Truth' by Joseph Wilson the film has been summarized as follows: 'Joseph Charles Wilson IV (born November 6, 1949) is a former United States diplomat best known for his 2002 trip to Niger to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase yellowcake uranium; his New York Times op ed piece, ""What I Didn't Find in Niger""; and the subsequent ""outing"" of his wife Valerie Plame as a CIA agent.' and the book ""Fair Game' by Valerie Plame. The books have been transformed into a bitingly vital screenplay by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and the film is searingly directed by Doug Lyman.

Why the film didn't enjoy a better success in the theaters is likely due to the still festering difference of opinion as to the pre-emptive war on Iraq, a war declared because of the 'evidence' that Iraq had Weapons of Mass destruction that is now approaching 10 years in activity despite the embarrassingly early declaration by that the war had been 'won' soon after declaration.  What FAIR GAME offers is Wilson's defense of his wife Valerie Plame's role in the CIA and how the government dealt with the coverup and smoke screen and other shenanigans by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby and other White House officials who revealed Plame's status as a CIA agent and were allegedly out to discredit her husband after he wrote a 2003 New York Times op-ed piece saying that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to justify the invasion of Iraq.

The actors are consistently superb throughout the large cast - Naomi Watts as Valerie Plame, Sean Penn as Joe Wilson, Bruce McGill as Jim Pavitt, Adam LeFevre as Karl Rove, David Andrews as Scooter Libby - and the many film clips of President Bush's televised speeches and statements from VP  Dick Cheney et al add credence to the atmosphere.  It is a film about the value of truth and as such it makes us all think more carefully about our current further involvement in the many battles currently being fought in the countries of the Middle East.  There is a speech Joe Wilson gives to his class at the end of the film that challenges his students to always defend democracy - the legacy of our Founding Fathers - and it is this speech that is the most compelling writing in the film.  A fine cast delivers a compelling film and it is a film all Americans should see.  Grady Harp, April 11",1301616000,5,2666,4.728448275862069

""Fair Game,"" like ""All the President's Men,"" tells an important true story about how dangerous the clashing between media and government can be and that we should always hold people accountable for their actions, regardless of the positions they hold. ""Fair Game"" is a taunt political thriller that is accurate to the events but also gripping in a cinematic way. The performances from Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are terrific and the film is well written with snappy dialogue. Long story shot, ""Fair Game"" is fine tuned, adult entertainment. The film makes you think, it's relevant, and exciting. It's important for films based on true events, where the outcome is already know, to remain engrossing, and ""Fair Game"" is certainly that.

On a side note, one of the biggest mysteries of the 2010 movie year was how completely overlooked Naomi Watt's performances were. She had a trio of tremendous films that were totally ignored.

4386648,4,B004IFYMWK,"Valerie Plame could have stepped out of a spy novel or a Hollywood thriller. A beautiful wife and mother, married to a diplomat, she has a day job, and she's a CIA spy. It's a true life version of something like ""True Lies.""

It is a story we all saw unfold on the news and Sunday morning news shows in 2003. Plame's husband, diplomat Joseph Wilson is asked by Vice President Dick Cheney's office to go to Niger to investigate whether 50 tons of yellow cake uranium was secretly sold to Saddam Hussein. While at the CIA Valerie is involved the controversy of whether aluminum rods sold to Hussein are meant for the enrichment of uranium to make nuclear weapons. Both are discovered to be unfounded, both are answers the White House didn't want to invalidate their effort for a war with Iraq. The Bush administration sent Scooter Libby over to the CIA to try and intimidate the CIA into providing the answers they wanted about WMD. In response to President George Bush's State of the Union address in which he said Niger sold the yellow cake uranium to Iraq, Wilson writes an opinion piece that contradicts the President's assertion and the next thing they knew, Plame was outed as a CIA field agent, and it appeared the leak came from the White House in an attempt to discredit Wilson and Plame.

As Wilson, Sean Penn turns in a performance where he disappears into the role without totally disappearing. Being the consumate actor that he is, Penn doesn't offer an impersonation of Wilson but delivers the sense of Wilson through his mannerisms, and that's what really sells the believability of the character Penn has created. Naomi Watts looks like she could be Valerie Plame's younger sister, and turns in one of the better performances of her career. David Andrews as Scooter Libby conveys all the condescending arrogance, not only of the Bush administration but of power. Adam LeFevre does a good Karl Rove. Sam Shepard does a cameo as Plame's father and provides a nice moment as the voice of reason providing her character with sage advice and perspective. President George W. Bush is shown in news footage.

Director Doug Liman who directed ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" realistically shows the flip side of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" they could be bookends, one that shows a fantastical husband and wife spy team, and one that realistically portrays a couple in that situation. ""Fair Game"" is a low key antidote to the fantasy. Limon also shows the repercussions of Plame's outing not only in the Wilsons' relationship but in the bigger picture that with Plame's outing, U.S. officials knowingly exposed her contacts and they ""disappeared.""

In the end ""Fair Game"" is the story of a family withstanding the most divisive forces brought to bare to divide and conquer Plame and Wilson. In the beginning of ""Fair Game"" Plame and Wilson have to live their lives as a lie. But in the end it is the truth that saves them.

The only bonus feature is a commentary by Wilson and Plame which is good when the corroborate the factual in the film.",1301356800,5,3029,4.718336483931947
4386649,5,B004IFYMWK,"There are certain indisputable facts relative to the case.  No Weapons of Mass Destruction were ever found in Iraq, despite the certainty with which Bush, Cheney et al. claimed.  There is no evidence that Saddam was trying to buy fissionable material in Niger or elsewhere, despite what Bush said.  More than 4,000 American soldiers, and  more than 100,000 Iraqis have died in the Iraqi conflict based on totally false claims.  Billions of dollars have been wasted on the lies.  There is no evidence that Saddam had anything to do with the attacks on September 11, 2001 or that he was connected in any way with Osama bin Laden or the Taliban.  Revealing the identity of a CIA agent is a criminal offense.  Do we need more?

I understand that many people do not like Sean Penn.  I'm not especially fond of his acting or his politics.  That is not the point.  To use the passive voice in claiming that the case has been proved false is an obvious evasion of the truth.  To smirk and sneer at the claims is not a helpful comment.

I thought the movie presented the case very well, and it makes me ashamed as an American that what Valerie Plame and her husband suffered has occurred.  Anyone who believes the movie used falsehoods should state their claims precisely; sneering and using more evasions are the tactics of the mentally lame.",1301270400,9,1334,4.617021276595745

The film suffers from the ""Sean Penn Fanatical Preaching Obsession"" he seems to have fallen into in recent years.

He is so consumed by some of his political views he can't see straight at times it seems and it adversely affects his movie making.

It seems he is only concerned with making political propoganda films these days at the exclusion of all else.

That is fine if that is all he is interested in now, but don't be surprised if fewer and fewer people get too motivated to see his movies.
