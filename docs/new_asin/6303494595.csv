7849148,3,6303494595,"I viewed this on a PBS late nite showing years ago, I needed it as a reference to the ""From Hell"" latest version of Jack The Ripper with guess who ""Johnny Depp"" The Masons were involved because Joseph Smith was a member, took their sacred ceremonial rights and wove them into the Mormon Church.  He was assassinated for usurping the rights and starting a new religion.  The same ritual that was performed in the Ripper murders, it is part of the temple LDS ceremonies..  Screw the royal family in England, they are corrupt as hell, as in FROM HELL!",1374969600,,548,4.515151515151516
7849149,4,6303494595,"I think you miss the point Richard (see previous review). ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp was a work of fiction based on a graphic novel of the same name. The basis of the plot is the much debated freemason/royal family cover up, and is still a highly regarded solution to the case, despite what other historians and ripperologists say. It was inspired by Stephen Knight's book, Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, as was the earlier movie ""Murder By Decree"" (1978). Stephen Knight's theories are compelling and well researched and presented in his book as the facts of the case, as he sees them. In the video he talks about his studies and it's simply a documentary about Knight and his conclusions. Whether you disagree with Knight is another matter entirely but you cannot compare this documentary with the many fictional accounts about Jack the Ripper. I wonder if you actually watched this video before you left a review?",1265500800,,928,4.8427672955974845
7849150,3,6303494595,"Hell', the Johnny Depp vehicle is better.

It really doens't bring up the Masonic

connection and doesn't really answer

the 'Who Done It?' aspect of the case

very completely. Six others out there

on same subject but this, unfortunately

is the best besides 'From Hell'. Sad...",1155772800,,279,4.956521739130435
