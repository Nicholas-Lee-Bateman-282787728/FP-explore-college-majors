8759086,5,B01EL39GGK,I received this order earlier than expected.  So far I have never had any problems with this company and would recommend them. Am happy with my products that I have brought from them so far.,1511136000,,190,4.428571428571429
8759087,4,B01EL39GGK,"Love the series, but this DVD version was a little bit of a disappointment. Many messed up subtitles (though if you haven't watched the series elsewhere, you probably wouldn't notice a lot of the mistakes) and sloppy-looking menus... and the fact that you can't skip forward at all. (I usually skip the ending credits since it gets repetitive...)

If you are able to find a different version the series, I'd recommend buying that instead. It may be a bit more expensive, but it's worth the extra. (Probably.)",1496361600,,508,4.839080459770115
8759088,5,B01EL39GGK,"Wonderful! Absolutely love Haikyuu and so glad to find this over the 2 part Season 1 edition. The quality is so much better. Came on time and in great condition. Was a little worried if it would play on our blu-ray or not, but it works perfectly.",1495929600,,246,4.25531914893617
8759089,5,B01EL39GGK,"Strong story, well-developed and interesting characters, awesome artwork and animation.  This series is top-notch sports anime. Awaiting the national tournament and the duel with Nekoma, the definitive  ""Battle in the Garbage Dump."" I have my fingers crossed that there will be at least two more dvd's released, because the story is far from over. I personally love everything about this series, and I don't even care for volleyball.  I own both seasons, and have it in my permanent queue on Crunchyroll.com Treat yourself to a lot of emotion, sports action, beautiful production values and unforgettable characters.",1495843200,,616,5.395833333333333
8759090,5,B01EL39GGK,Love it! No scratches on disks! Played very well with my old DVD player! English subs. I love this anime so much! Thank you!!,1486339200,,125,4.25
