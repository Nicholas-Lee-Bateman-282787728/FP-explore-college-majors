3438526,3,B0019LJ6FY,"It is what it is.  So so video for those expecting total nonsense.
A great way to turn your brain into something resembeling and feeling like pudding.
From time to time a rational person needs to turn his mind into mush, and this will do it.
NOT politically correct.  Sure to outrage the feminists.",1264982400,4,298,4.5
8274357,5,B0019LJ6FY,That blonde in the construction hat was great - pretty and funny! I'd love to see her in something else!,1485216000,,104,4.25
8274358,5,B0019LJ6FY,I love it,1474243200,,9,2.3333333333333335
8274359,5,B0019LJ6FY,This is an awesome satirical spoof for all of those horrible safety meetings at work. It would be great to sneak this in to the big power point at work,1435449600,,151,4.066666666666666
8274360,1,B0019LJ6FY,"Topless women only. One or two women at most have real breasts, the rest have ugly fakes. If you like fake breasts you will love the women in this film.",1434067200,,152,4.1
8274361,4,B0019LJ6FY,"This is a fun cheesy safety video, only to be used with those not faint of heart.  Anyone who buys it needs to remember that it is supposed to be!",1423699200,,146,3.8666666666666667
8274362,5,B0019LJ6FY,"These are the best. The first brake job (Midas) I had on my 2002 Subaru Outback Sport had terrible brake squeal throughout the life of those pads. When I brought it back to Midas the proprietor told me you'd have to use OEM. next brake job I was at Mavis. I mentioned the brake squeal. He said put on Akebono. They'd be a little more but they wouldn't squeal. Not only did they NOT squeal, but they lasted about 10,000 miles more.

Note:  Amazon Auto suggested the pads I ordered were not made for my current car. They were!  Just check the Akebono website fittment chart and order according to that.",1390089600,,600,4.387387387387387
8274363,1,B0019LJ6FY,Acting was terrible and I thought there was going to be more nudity but it turned out just to be a s***ty waste of my time.,1360540800,6,123,3.769230769230769
8274364,5,B0019LJ6FY,"I was turned on to this by one of the actresses in the movie, Delotta Brown.  I actually did learn a couple of safety items as well.  The movie was classically cheesy and ""B movie"" for the most part but it was also quite funny (in a twisted way) in quite a few parts.  If you want a sophomoric and juvenile laugh-fest, try this one out!",1355443200,,336,4.0606060606060606
8274365,3,B0019LJ6FY,so so okay! but really this movie was just not made to be taken seriously! needed more substance and a better plot to begin with but the nudity i guess is suppose to make up for that!,1353974400,,183,3.972972972972973
8274366,1,B0019LJ6FY,"Don't bother.

Basically none of the scenes from the trailer are in the film in any greater length than that of in the trailer. In other words if you wanted to see more of the awesome redhead your out of luck, or thing topless big breasted woman shaking them by the rocks, or the girl carrying the melons then you're out of luck.

Don't waste your time or money like I did, I took one for the team, so heed my warning.

I paid the $7.99 to own this and it's a waste, I can't figure out how to download it (I think you can only do that if you have a kindle). So I got screwed by amazon and by the misleading trailer of this film.",1352246400,16,628,3.9291338582677167
