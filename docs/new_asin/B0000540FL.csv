English Version: B+
Fight Scenes: A+
The first half of the disc is basically the semi finals. It was pretty fun to see all these oddball fighters, but the real treat is in the second half when Goku squares off against Pikkon.
I've never said this, but the music on this tape rocks. During Goku's fight with Pikkon, there is some great electric guitar that really fits the music. And the fight scenes! I can't even begin to explain how great the fight is. Goku firing his Kamehameha Wave and Pikkon constantly shooting his Super Thunder Attack is just insane! If you crave action than you need to see this. If you have to buy one tape to impress your friends with DBZ, this is it! Nothing short of amazing.",1006300800,3,869,4.403726708074534
7930537,4,B0000540FL,"This movie has two things that make it a must-have for DBZ fans: Awesome fight scenes, and our first view of Videl and teenage Gohan. But it also has two anoying things: We only see Videl and teenage Gohan in the last episode, and the Grand Kai. The grand Kai is probably the second most stupid character in the DBZ universe (The most stupid being the Ginyu Force). But aside from that, it's a pretty good movie.",988502400,,412,4.363636363636363
7930538,4,B0000540FL,"I love Dragon Ballz, i think its one of the coolest things ever put on gods green earth. The story is top notch, the fights are drool inducing, and the message of good vs evil, love, respect, heart, desire, death, and courAage make this one of the most important cartoons of our time. This review has so far been cheesey, which is another trait DBZ has down pat. I think the Cheese is what makes this show so good, i mean, who could forget the time Vegeta had to wear pink, killians love affair with Marion, or even some of the stupid things Goku says all the time, its pure camp, and pure cheese and pure pleasure. This video is filled with cheese, it features Goku being stupid on snake way( very funny scene, remember the "" bye guys "" part ), and the different kai's of the universe( the video explains the whole Kai thing ) constantly agrue and poke fun at one another. This one had some fights, but nothing memorable, the storys ok, even though its just a gap spacer between the cell saga and the even cooler Buu saga ( wait til you see the Buu saga, Dbz at its best ) But until then, sit back and enjoy some newly released american dbz, its been a couple months, you've earn it.",980985600,,1184,4.243362831858407
