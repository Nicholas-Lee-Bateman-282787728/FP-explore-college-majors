7863723,5,6304173202,"These cartoons have to be seen to be believed! Bimbo's Initiation, Is My Palm Red and Betty Boop M.D. are the weirdest things you'll see without breaking any laws.
What must have been in the air at the Fleischer Studios in the early Thirties is anyone's guess. Brilliant stuff that anyone from a casual fan to a student of animation has to see - not just amoung the classic cartoons but amoung the classic films of all time!
Also, the masters used for this series are beautiful, with the only downside being the lose of the Paramount logo on most of them. You will not find better quality B/W cartoons even from Disney.",994896000,16,619,4.486725663716814
