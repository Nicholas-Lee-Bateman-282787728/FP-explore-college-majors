2634841,4,B000HDZ96U,"First, let me quickly mention KOI MIL GAYA, a 2003 film about a mentally handicapped man named Rohit who receives superhuman powers from a space alien. KRRISH  is the 2006 sequel, which then tells the story of Rohit's son, Krishna. KRRISH also unleashes India's first film superhero, which probably has something to do with this film breaking all sorts of Indian box office records.

KRRISH opens with the very young and chubby boy Krishna Mehra unveiling his precocious talents to his astounded school instructors, who begin to test him for his I.Q. level. Krishna's grandmother (Rekha), fearful of the consequences, takes Krishna far, far away and raises him in the isolation of the forests and mountains. Years later, Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) is now an innocent, sheltered (but very well muscled) young man, at peace with nature and its creatures. And he grins a lot, I'm assuming because he's pure of heart or something. It's at this stage that he meets the visiting Priya (Priyanka Chopra), whom he saves when her glider collides with a tree. In spending time with Priya, Krishna reveals his superhuman abilities as he becomes smitten with her. When Priya, who's only in India on a 15 day vacation, returns to Singapore, Krishna is grief stricken. Priya, too, doesn't feel too well, but it's because she and her friend Honey realize that they're reporting 5 days late to their jobs at a media network. On the verge of being fired, Honey tells their boss about Krishna and his talents. Honey convinces the reluctant Priya to use the pretense of love to get Krishna to Singapore. But, really, they want to put him on television and, thus, save their jobs.

If this sounds like I'm giving away the whole story, you're wrong. That's only a smidgen of what goes on in this film. I'll sum up the rest of the plot in one sentence: Krishna does end up in Singapore, inadvertently becomes a superhero, and foils the uncool plan of an evil, egotistical scientist.

For Bollywood, KRRISH is big scale movie making. It's your quintessential escapist flick and displays an unabashed sense of fun and enthusiasm. The filmmakers really went to work on this one, although there's still that trademark frivolity present, which is a signature of most Bollywood films. Now, this movie is 3 hours long, so when I say that the bulk of the movie's first half deals with the sugary-sweet love story between Krishna and career girl Priya, well, that's a lot of comedy romance for a superhero flick. The superhero element is still there, throughout, as Krishna does persist in engaging in impossible feats, but this element is overshadowed by the romance. But, following the sizzling musical number at the circus, Krrish is born and the action begins and then never relents.

I thought the special effects rocked. Stunt choreographer Tony Ching Siu-tung (HERO, SHAOLIN SOCCER, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS) concocts exhilarating wire-fu stunts, quite reminiscent of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. In his black leather duster and black, zigzagged circus mask, Krrish looks amazing, very cool. He performs acrobatics, swims like a dolphin, leaps to improbable heights, and performs wushu. There's also an undeniable nod to THE MATRIX. The fight scenes are slick and without the amateurish fight sound effects Bollywood usually inflicts on its films. Really, the only effect which sucks is the unconvincing sequence with the forest backdrop where Krrish is kicking ninja booty in super speed.

As directed by his father Rakesh Roshan (who also directed him in KOI MIL GAYA), I thought Hrithik did a fine job of acting in both the roles of Krishna and his look-alike dad Rohit. He portrays both Krishna and Rohit with such distinct and differing personalities that his playing dual parts never really becomes a distraction. His Krishna is so effervescent and (dare I say?) so soulful a character that I couldn't help but like and root for him. Even though he does fling that ""Ain't I hunky?"" grin way too often. Rekha as Sonia Mehra, Krishna's grandma, turns in a real good performance, especially when she strays from her character's stoic persona and turns on the water works. Naseeruddin Shah as the evil scientist Dr. Siddhant Arya gets a chance to cut loose, and he gleefully obliges us with a patented Master Villain-ish effort. Priyanka Chopra is beautiful, no doubt, but she's only decent here, suffering from Lois Lane-itis as she does. How could Priya not know that Krrish is Krishna? You think the similarity in names just might be a clue? And if she already knows someone with special powers, and then someone in the same vicinity shows up displaying special powers but in a costume, then this might be a hint that it's the same dude, right? Aargh!

And, of course, there's the songs, but only four of them here, although KRRISH oddly doesn't indulge in its first musical number until about 40 minutes into it. Once again, Hrithik shows off his grace and fluidity in dancing. I really like the circus number, where he busts some serious moves. Priyanka also acquits herself well in these musical numbers. But I've seen her do better. And since I'm babbling on about music here, a mention must go out to the appropriately grandiose score, which meshes very well with the superhero component.

The 2-disc dvd set is handsomely packaged. Disc one has the movie presentation. Disc two contains these following special features:  ""Hrithik's Journey: KOI MIL GAYA to KRRISH"" which is your default making-of segment; ""Action Cuts"" (24 minutes long, focuses mostly on the stunts and includes Hrithik going to Hong Kong to train in wushu); ""Making of the Music"" - an in-depth, 21-plus-minutes-long look into the film's songs; Red Carpet for KRRISH in London, including interviews with the cast and director (21 plus minutes); and the theatrical trailer. For those concerned, there's enough English used in these features by cast and crew that the language barrier becomes a non-issue.

Even though the movie length is almost as long as this review, KRRISH is fun popcorn fare. No, it's not perfect or original. It borrows heavily from THE MATRIX, PAYCHECK, and, of course, a ton of superhero films. But the end result is worth watching for its sheer exuberance and gall. There really are some dynamic, visually cool action moments here. One of my favorite scenes (and I have quite a few favorites here) is Krrish set on a panoramic cityscape as he indefatigably pursues a helicopter. Very nice, extended chase sequence. With KRRISH 2 having already been announced, things are looking good for India's only superhero, and I cannot wait to see what happens next. To echo the oft repeated quote in this film: ""Just imagine...""",1179878400,34,6698,4.951067615658363
2634842,5,B000HDZ96U,"This film is the only Bollywood movie I have seen, but the plot is so engrossing that it quickly takes away any preconceived ideas one might have about Indian movies. Although there are a few down sides, the overall ""awesomeness"" of this film makes up for it. The premise of the entire film is very unbelievable, but the fact that director was able to take that and still make a memorable film is a huge achievement in itself. The unintentional comedy is what makes this film so unique and good. Although it's not ""good"" like The Godfather, it's still good like a good old superhero film. With the extremely long and drawn out dance sequences aside, KRRISH is a one-of-a-kind film that has good morals and is still fun to watch.",1179532800,5,728,4.564885496183206
2634843,5,B000HDZ96U,"I've been watching Bollywood films for only a few months, now, but I've been a movie buff all my life. I have to say I have been deeply impressed by Hrithik Roshan's sheer acting ability. Just between ""Koi...Mil Gaya"" and ""Krrish"" he should get every acting award going. So he can dance like his bones are made of water, so he's doggone attractive (not blind here!), he's also an incandescent actor, and ""Krrish"" is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in years. A touch of Tarzan, a touch of ""The Matrix"", a touch of ""Minority Report"", plus romance and music. Great stuff!",1169683200,22,578,4.5673076923076925
2634844,1,B000HDZ96U,"I love Bollywood but I have to say this film is not one of my favorites.  I understand it did tremendously well at the Box office yet I don't understand why.  Perhaps because of the dancing and charm of lead actor, Hrithik Roshan who imo, has yet to prove his ability as an actor.  The guy needs to stop making these movies where all he does is dance and pose for the camera. That's pretty much all he does in this movie.  It's supposed to be a movie about a super hero yet we don't really get to see that super hero until the very latter parts of the film.  The lead actress, Priyanka Chopra is terrible.  Just terrible.

The love story doesn't work.  In fact, nothing works except for the scarce appearances of Rekha who seems to give the only real performance in the film.  Give this one a skip unless you're a fan of Hrithik Roshan.",1168992000,3,836,4.2405063291139244

2634847,1,B000HDZ96U,"First let me say that I hardly ever write a review anywhere unless its incredibly good, or incredibly bad, in this case unfortunatly, its the latter.

The way he danced and smiled, and danced and smiled, and was so very incredibly conscious of how wonderfully beautiful he was with his hair flowing in the breaze as he danced from car top to car top, with his huge ceaseless sparkling smile. Ding!

I can handle pretty much anything, pretty boy actors like Johnny Depp or Tom Cruise at least have an air of cool, and never before has beauty actually been offensive to me, hey, I'm even a bit of a sap (my favorite movie is Chungking Express!) but this guy, well he's so pretty and sweet, and the way he ""works it"" he just makes me ill...

A lot of Indians I talked to liked this movie, esp. with it being the first action movie of its kind with a good budget to match, and (apparently) the sugary sweet factor is more normal to Indian Culture, but this film makes The Sound of Music look more hard boiled than Reservoir Dogs. Its simply shocking. American sensibilities beware.",1158105600,7,1077,4.456852791878172

This film is about Krishna, son of Rohit.  Rohit is the superhero in Koi Mil Gaya, part 1 of the trilogy and this movie is part 2.  Krrish3, is coming out to theaters late this year.  It is India's first superhero!  The Roshan's have done a wonderful job of creating a hero with strength of heart as well as strength of body and mind.

2634866,5,B000HDZ96U,"So this is the sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koi-Mil-Gaya/dp/B0001EQI8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koi...Mil Gaya</a>&nbsp;and for those who haven't seen it, I'll try to keep things as vague as I can for this review, but I can't promise to keep completely spoiler free. The biggest spoiler is that the title character in this film, Krishna, is the son of Rohit, the hero of ""Koi... Mil Gaya."" Unlike most franchises, where each installment is compared to its predecessor, you can't do that here. While ""Krrish"" is the next chapter in the story, these are two very different films. Although Hrithik Roshan plays both heroes, Krishna and Rohit are only similar in the sense that they're very good human beings. Krishna, is sheltered, but supremely self-confident, he's completely comfortable in his own skin, and extremely adaptable. I don't think there's an awkward bone in his body. All qualities that Rohit doesn't have for various reasons.

So twenty-odd years after ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" we see Mrs. Mehra has relocated into an unnamed (but must be the most beautiful) part of India (and the entire planet) in an effort to shield her grandson from the world. Petrified that the gifts the young man inherited from his father would be exploited and put him in grave peril, she emphatically forbids Krishna from behaving in any way that is not ""ordinary"" or ""normal."" Much to her never ending dismay, her grandson is a willful, headstrong, almost rebellious young man. Who makes no secret of the fact that her restrictions and the isolation stifles him.

He's chafing at the bit so the arrival of a girl is really only the straw that breaks the camel's back. Once romance comes into play, all bets are off!

Without getting into too much detail the guy with some major Shakti (powers) quite inadvertently becomes a superhero! I have to say I love how he gets the mask, and to me it doesn't have that ""hey I'm a SUPERHERO"" feeling. Okay the coat is a straight-up rip-off of The Matrix, but that coat is SEXY! It made Keanu Reeves a stud, (not that he isn't totally dishy without it) so why not invoke the magic of a black leather trench coat if you have it? I never leave the house without mine from September to early December! Besides it's the most versatile, Non-costume ever created for a Superhero, it's reversible! Besides, I can't be the only person on the planet sick of spandex right?

The fact that Krishna does become Krrish, is yet another reason that you can't compare the two movies. Rohit, never became a Superhero in the same sense. Krrish, is definitely a S-U-P-E-R-H-E-R-O, complete with nearly every trope available to the title, except no secret lair. But part three gets released Nov. 3rd there's still time to work out the secret lair thing.

But there's a lot more going on then just becoming a superhero for Krishna, there are adorable friends to be made, a city to explore, and a girl to woo. He's a busy guy. The girl is Priya, played by Priyanka Chopra. I'll be blunt, she doesn't deserve him! BUT Krishna is stubborn, and he's one of those people who will forgive someone they truly love just about anything. Still, it really was satisfying that he didn't act like a complete doormat when it came to her nonsense! All I can say is that if Priya hasn't grown up in part three, I'm rooting for the bad girl!

Boy it's terribly hard avoiding spoilers for this one, but I'm trying. Naturally, in every superhero film there needs to be an Ultimate Bad Guy, and a threat against humanity, and there is one of each. But interestingly enough neither is the main thrust of the narrative here. I don't mean that it isn't incorporated well, it's perfectly acceptable, but I personally wasn't invested in either. Maybe it's because the threat to humanity, was a little more than my sense of the ridiculous could appreciate. BUT don't let that put you off, like I said, it's incidental to the actual tale. The story is about Krishna, entering into the world, and the discoveries he makes about himself, and his family.

Okay, like always the technical stuff...

Production and Direction, it's amazing what a difference two years can make. As I mentioned in my review for ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" the special effects in 2004 were on par with ""The Abyss"" here in 2006, they're mostly on par with ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" FOR THE RECORD, I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN THE EDITED VERSIONS OF ""THE MATRIX"" ON NETWORK TV, and I've never seen ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" but I have seen clips and promos... both make sense because Mr. R.R. worked with both teams to come up with the movie magic and Roshan Jr. even went to China to learn advanced wirework. On the whole the efforts paid off, especially in the first half of the movie, where Mr. Hrithik Roshan looks as if he's been leaping through treetops since birth. The first major fight scene in the second half is also very, very, well done.

Remember, it might not be the level of amazing we got here in the states in 2006 but, 1,000,000 rupees = 18,000 US dollars!

Unfortunately, Mr. R.R. made a fatal mistake during the climax. He had to go and guild the lily. I think it was a moment of ""look at all these cool toys and what we can DO!"" Sometimes, it's better to know when to stop. As Krrish goes on an Avenging Angel spree, the special effect hinder rather than help. Thank God, Hrithik Roshan has those magnetic eyes that fill with emotion because they pull you back into the scene and keep you there.

Still, I say kudos to Mr. R.R. for doing something brave and risking the family prestige and business reputation on something that in his country's popular culture is still very new. The sci-fi and fantasy genres are big risks in Indian cinema from a popular and business standpoint. Sharuhk Khan, one of the very biggest and most popular entertainers in Hindi films of all time tried it, and let's just say the results were not exactly what he hoped for, (I still need to see RA-ONE until then I have no personal opinion) did he use A LOT of elements from popular films from around the world? Yes. Were there some rather blatant clichs? Yes. Show me ONE superhero movie without them, not even Christopher Nolan could do it. But if you'll pardon some Vulcan philosophy, *The whole, is greater than the sum of it's parts.*

Just like I wouldn't call ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" a copy of ET, I wouldn't call this movie a copy of any of the other films it uses as a template. As a whole it's unique unto itself, reflecting the values of the people who made it, and the culture they live in.

Aesthetics, Okay I like to imagine that when Mr. R.R. and Mr. H.R. started planning this one perhaps the Jr. Roshan might have said, ""You know dad, maybe the wardrobe could be a little more streamlined."" LOL I have a warped imagination but the costumes are SO MUCH BETTER! Oye! I realize in ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" they tried to downplay Mr. H.R.'s physique until um... the first 3/4's of the movie, but after that... I still don't know what the thinking was there. You can't make the man look bad, that's just not possible, but at least there are no snake skin shirts. Krishna might be blissfully unaware he's a stud, but at least he dresses like it's 2006 and not 1989! Still, I like his village clothes best. They reflect who he is. Priyanka Chopra is not the kind of girl who'd be caught DEAD in any dated wardrobe, and she even got killer shoes the minx! Ms. Zinta deserved better!

As for the sets I adore Krishna's house, it might be my new dream house! Most of the movie is shot outdoors, and of course outdoor cinematography in Hindi films is second-to-none in my experience. John Ford would be jealous at the vistas they have to work with. Singapore, is also shot to her best advantage. As for the Villain's lair, okay I admit it, it's very 90's Star Trek, but as a major Trekkie I'm not going to hate on it. Warm and fuzzy childhood memories you know. I'd give it a good solid A.

Performances, I'm getting point where even I am sick of praising Hrithik Roshan. I swear the man creeps me out! When I watch ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" I forget about Krishna entirely, and when I watch ""Krrish"" I almost forget the same actor did each role. Seriously folks, this is the level of talent the man has! The plain fact is I've NEVER seen him give a BAD one. Could some of the movies be better? Yes. But he himself is never BAD. His dad is still pretty ""old-school"" in his approach so yes, there are moments when things get a little ""hammy"" and this isn't his absolute best role ever, BUT he HURTS HIMSELF doing this series! He hurt himself filming ""Koi Mil Gaya"" he hurt himself twice during this one, and he dang near got killed when a wire broke. He's hurt himself a few times doing part three too! He's not using a stunt double folks, and for the record I think he's certifiably NUTS! If I were his mom I'd raise a ruckus with both Father and Son!

Rekha, If possible I think she's even more effective here then in ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" there are moments when I ache so badly with her that I feel like my heart's being shredded. I hope she's in part three they're keeping quiet about it. If she isn't they'll be a huge hole in the fabric of the story. She's vital. I'm fast becoming a Rekha fan of epic proportions.

Okay, I have to do it, Priyanka Chopra... She might be my biggest Bollywood disappointment. You see, I *adored* her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-Your-Raashee-Dvd/dp/B0030EW75O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's Your Raashee ?

But somehow after watching her evolve she's become so mechanical, and gives off this ""I'm a star"" vibe that just irritates me to no end! I hate it when I can tell an actor is acting! I don't know what happened to her, but I miss the fresh-faced, genuine Miss Chopra.

Interestingly enough, Aishwarya Rai was offered the lead in both ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" and here in Krrish, scheduling conflicts wrecked both. Now, there is probably no bigger fan of the onscreen Jodi of Roshan/Rai than I am, BUT I'm glad it didn't work out. If she'd done ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" well, I can't say much without spoiling but suffice it to say, I would've hated this movie. If she'd done this movie, then her pregnancy would've forced her to be written out of part three, which would have made me sad. So here's hoping she'll sign a project with Mr. Roshan in the near future. Quite honestly, while watching this movie I kept longing for Deepika Padukone to play Priya, I really think she would have been perfect.

Naseeruddin Shah, A terrific actor who gave a half-hearted performance. Like I mentioned as the Ultimate Bad Guy he really had a tiny role, BUT that's partly why I'm a little cheesed off! His role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Na-Milegi-Dobara-2011-Hindi-Movie-Bollywood-Film-Indian-Cinema-DVD-English-Subtitles/dp/B005DJDF2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) (Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema DVD) - English Subtitles</a>&nbsp;was MUCH SMALLER, and he left a lasting impression. Here it's like he decided, ""oh I'm a cartoon villain, I'll just talk."" I'm sorry, but I expect more effort from such a highly celebrated actor. A little professional integrity would have been nice! Then again, from some of the interviews I've read he seems to be a little snobbish. My only issue with that is, why take the part at all? I might not be keen on Miss Chopra, but this is the one thing that I'll say is a true blemish on a very good film.

Parents take note, this movie is more violent than ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" I wouldn't watch it with a child under 8, and there are scary moments that can disturb particularly sensitive children. I strongly, strongly, recommend watching it first and then deciding based on your children's individual needs. Maybe some of your younger children are able to process such things, maybe some older children cannot. But do use sound judgment.

Music and Dances, Music quite honestly, it's great while you're watching the movie, but I can't remember any of the songs accept the Circus number. Dances, Hero is perfect as usual, Heroine, is adequate.

This movie is okay at the beginning, but then turns boring watching him smiling and posing and showing off his body and hair. Tooo long of a movie.

2634879,5,B000HDZ96U,"We love Bollywood movies, especially CHEEZY ones. This one wasn't as CHEEZY as some. This was recommended by a friend after we saw Koi Mil Gaya. It was better than Koi Mil Gaya. It was better than we expected. It was better than RA-One by FAR! (Read my review of that one.)There is some violence in this movie, but it isn't taken as far and is not 'glorified' the way it is in Western movies. Krrish is an excellent character. The actors did well (not a fan of Mama, though)and the storyline is good. The movie is rated for ages 12+ because of the violence. My 7 y/o watched it before we saw the rating and she was far less affected by THIS movie than she was by the violence in The 3 Stooges. She chalked this one up to 'imaginary super hero'. So, I would call this movie a Family film, but definitely hide the eyes of your 13 y/o daughter when Hrithik is on screen. Just sayin:. ""Squeeeeeeeeeeeee. He's sooooooo cute!!!""

Yes, it has some wonderful dancing, beef spots, and corny type things that go on but that is the charm of this style Bollywood.  The subtitles are easy to read if a bit fast.

I highly recommend this film to families, men, women, and children alike all are sure to enjoy.",1255392000,,372,4.405797101449275
2634882,4,B000HDZ96U,"First, let me quickly mention&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koi-Mil-Gaya/dp/B0000BZNJL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>, a 2003 film about a mentally handicapped man named Rohit who receives superhuman powers from a space alien. KRRISH is the 2006 sequel, which then tells the story of Rohit's son, Krishna. KRRISH also unleashes India's first cinematic superhero, which probably has something to do with this film breaking all sorts of Indian box office records.

KRRISH opens with the very young and chubby boy Krishna Mehra unveiling his precocious talents to his astounded school instructors, who then begin to test him for his I.Q. level. Krishna's grandmother (Rekha), fearful of the consequences, takes Krishna far, far away and raises him in the isolation of the forests and mountains.

Years later, the boy has grown up an innocent, sheltered, but very well-muscled young man (as Hrithik Roshan now takes over the role). Krishna is at peace with nature and its creatures. And, boy, does he smile a lot, I'm assuming because he's pure of heart or something. It's at this stage that he meets the visiting Priya (Priyanka Chopra), whom he saves when her glider collides with a tree. In spending time with Priya and becoming smitten with her, Krishna reveals his superhuman abilities. When Priya, who's only in India on a 15 day vacation, has to return to Singapore, Krishna is grief stricken. Priya also doesn't feel too good about her leavetaking, but it's more because she and her friend Honey realize that they're reporting 5 days late to their jobs at a media network. On the verge of being fired, Honey tells their boss about Krishna and his talents. Honey convinces the reluctant Priya to use the pretense of love to get Krishna to Singapore. But, really, they want to put him on television and, thus, save their jobs.

If this sounds like I'm giving away the whole story, you're wrong. That's only a smidgen of what goes on in this film. I'll sum up the rest of the plot in one sentence: Krishna does end up in Singapore, inadvertently becomes a superhero, and foils the uncool plan of an evil, egotistical scientist.

For Bollywood, KRRISH is big scale movie making. It's your quintessential escapist flick and displays an unabashed sense of fun and enthusiasm. The filmmakers really went to work on this one, although there's still that trademark frivolity present, which is a signature of most Bollywood films. Now, this movie is 3 hours long, so when I say that the bulk of the movie's first half deals with the sugary-sweet love story between Krishna and career girl Priya, well, that's a lot of comedy romance for a superhero flick. The superhero element is still there, throughout, as Krishna does persist in engaging in impossible feats, but this element is overshadowed by the romance. But, following the sizzling musical number at the circus, Krrish is born and the action begins and then never relents.

I thought the special effects rocked. Stunt choreographer Tony Ching Siu-tung (HERO, SHAOLIN SOCCER, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS) concocts exhilarating wire-fu stunts, quite reminiscent of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. In his black leather duster and black, zigzagged circus mask, Krrish looks amazing, very cool. He performs acrobatics, swims like a dolphin, leaps to improbable heights, and performs wushu. There's also an undeniable nod to THE MATRIX. The fight scenes are slick and without the amateurish fight sound effects Bollywood sometimes inflicts on its films. Really, the only effect which sucks is the unconvincing sequence with the forest backdrop where Krrish is kicking ninja booty in super speed.

As directed by his father Rakesh Roshan (who also directed him in KOI MIL GAYA), I thought Hrithik did a fine job of acting in both the roles of Krishna and his look-alike dad Rohit. He portrays both Krishna and Rohit with such distinct and differing personalities that his playing dual parts never really becomes a distraction. His Krishna is so effervescent and (dare I say?) so soulful a character that I couldn't help but like and root for him. Even though he does fling that ""Ain't I hunky?"" grin way too often. Rekha as Sonia Mehra, Krishna's grandma, turns in a real good performance, especially when she strays from her character's stoic persona and turns on the water works. Naseeruddin Shah as the evil scientist Dr. Siddhant Arya gets a chance to cut loose, and he gleefully obliges us with a patented Master Villain-ish effort. Priyanka Chopra is beautiful, no doubt, but she's only decent here, suffering from Lois Lane-itis as she does. How could Priya not know that Krrish is Krishna? You think the similarity in names just might be a clue? And if she already knows someone with special powers, and then someone in the same vicinity shows up displaying special powers but in a costume, then this might be a hint that it's the same dude, right? Oy!

And, of course, there are the songs, but only four of them here, although KRRISH oddly doesn't indulge in its first musical number until about 40 minutes into it. Once again, Hrithik shows off his grace and fluidity in dancing. I really like the circus number, where he busts some serious moves. Priyanka also acquits herself well in these musical numbers. But I've seen her do better. And since I'm babbling on about music here, a mention must go out to the appropriately grandiose score, which meshes very well with the superhero component.

Even though the movie length is almost as long as this review, KRRISH is fun popcorn fare. No, it's not perfect or original. It borrows heavily from THE MATRIX, PAYCHECK, and, of course, a ton of superhero films. But the end result is worth watching for its sheer exuberance. There really are some dynamic, visually cool action moments here. One of my favorite scenes (and I have quite a few favorites here) is Krrish set on a panoramic cityscape as he indefatigably pursues a helicopter. Very nice, extended chase sequence. With KRRISH 2 still waiting in the wings, things look good for India's sole superhero, and I cannot wait to see what happens next. To echo the oft repeated quote in this film: ""Just imagine...""",1253318400,,6226,5.0145067698259185
2634883,5,B000HDZ96U,"""Krrish"" is the sequel to ""Koi Mil Gaya"" but there is no need to watch the original before seeing ""Krrish"", since everything you need to know about it is told during a flashback sequence about halfway through

Krishna is the son of Rohit, who twenty years before had an encounter with aliens, ala ""E.T."".  In return for protecting him, the alien Jadu gave Rohit extraordinary abilities.  After Jadu returned to his home planet, Rohit's abilities worked against him and stole both him and his wife away from his mother, Sonia Mehra.  For that reason, when Sonia (played by the fabulous Reika)discovers that her grandson, Krishna, has also been blessed, not only with advanced mental capabilities, but with superhuman strength, speed, and agility, she spirits him away to a village high in the Himalayas (The scenery is truly breathtaking).

Fate steps in, in the form of a lovely young woman named Prya, with whom Krishna promptly falls in love.  Although, for obvious reasons, Sonia doesn't want to allow Krishna to go to Singapore and ask Prya's mother for her blessings on their marriage, she eventually gives in.  Krishna takes his lady love to a circus, where a deadly fire breaks out, forcing Krishna to face his destiny.  Using his superhuman abilities, he saves everyone trapped inside the tent, donning a mask to hide his identity.  Thus, the superhero Krrish is born.

Again we are on familiar territory here, but this film rises above the average superhero film.  The almighty hand of karma guides Krishna into an encounter he never thought possible, giving him an opportunity to right the wrongs, not only of the present, but of the future and the past as well.

Krrish is not just and action film.  It is truly a thing of great beauty.  Hrithik Roshan's performance is not just heroic.  It is also vulnerable and touchingly innocent.  And no matter how many times I see this film the last scene brings tears to my eyes.",1252627200,,1931,4.82370820668693

8138915,4,B000HDZ96U,"This movie is a ripoff of Tarzan, Spider-Man, and Batman. It's a sequel to Koi... Mil Gaya, which was a ripoff of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and Flowers for Algernon. (The third in the trilogy, Krrish 3, is a ripoff of X-Men and a few other things, but most that).

I use the word ""ripoff"" with love. Bollywood seems to do this quite a bit, especially with their action movies. They'll take the premise from about three American movies, throw them all into a blender, fill 25% of the movie with gratuitous product placement (this movie often feels like a commercial for Lays potato chips and a few other name brands), and add 4 fully produced music videos throughout. It's cheesy, ridiculous, shameless, and I love it.

Hrithik Roshan is charming as always. He is legitimately a great actor, one of the best dancers you'll ever see, does many of his own stunts, and always seems to be having fun in his performances. Krrish is no exception. The movie is well shot and often beautiful to look at (particularly, the first half). The presentation on this DVD is strong. I wish it had an HD blu-ray release, as it visually deserves it, but this looks about as solid as any DVD can.

I like this movie quite a lot. It's really not that ""good."" The messages feel forced and it blatantly rips off several other franchises, but it is well made on a technical level, the lead is very charming, and it's pretty fun.
