It's different then other films in the way it goes about telling it's story and etc, but it's a good film and people who appreciate movies as an art form or movies that are unique, will like it :)

Also, though I wasn't a fan of the cover art of the move, I do love that it comes with a little booklet inside the DVD case, that has a little synopsis of about 9-10 other foreign films from around the globe that came out the same year as this film.",1374537600,,546,3.963636363636364
