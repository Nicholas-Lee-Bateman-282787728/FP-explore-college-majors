4333778,2,B004DNWPKS,"Scar is very similar to last years Chain Letter, in that is another torture porn movie masquerading as a teen slasher movie. I wasn't a big fan of Chain Letter, and I'm even less of a fan of Scar. If it weren't for Angela Bettis or some old-school slasher moments early on, then this would be a complete waste. And I absolutely hated the reveal of the killer. It was someone that I initially liked and I didn't want him/her to be the killer. I really wish this torture porn era in horror would end already. I liked Saw and I liked Hostel, but almost everything in this subgenre that has been released since those two films have been either average or horrible. Scar isn't horrible...but when that's the nicest thing I can say about a movie, it's far from good.",1304035200,2,760,4.397163120567376

Thus is the basic premise of the torture porn flick, Scar 3-D. Survivor of a sadistic attack by a demented mortician, Joan Burrows (Angela Bettis - May), is returning home to visit her police officer brother Jeff (Christopher Titus - Titus), and niece Olympia (Kirby Bliss Blanton - Hannah Montana) for Olympia's high school graduation. Almost as soon as Joan is back, two of the graduating class disappears mysteriously. As the mutilated body of one appears, another student disappears. Much like when Joan was being held by Bishop (Ben Cotton - Slither). What follows is a series of found bodies and disappearing students. Among the new characters around town is the new mortuary director Melvin Gray (Bill Baksa - Tucker & Dale vs. Evil), Olympia's friend Paul (Devon Grave - Dexter), and Paul's father (James D. Hopkin - Fear Itself).

Part of the film is told through flashbacks of Joan's capture with her friend Susie while partying in the cemetery, ensuing torture at the hand of Bishop, and her eventual escape and killing of her tormentor. The flashbacks are spaced nicely to coincide with events in the current storyline. But it's not enough to save this film from mediocrity. While the movie has good, disturbing scenes and story, it never lives up to its full potential.

Scar 3-D is one of those films that has a tremendous amount of potential, but comes up lacking at the end of the day. The concept of your torture, and even death, being in the hands of your tortured friend, whose own well being is controlled by your ability to withstand punishment is disturbing and terrifying. To have your life at the hands of someone whose life is in your tortured hands is scarier than being in the hands of a psychopath. But they took this concept and buried it in mediocrity, and the obvious of plot gimmicks.

Surrounded by a young up-and-coming cast, Angela Bettis turns in a believable performance as the soul, tortured by the death of her friend, and Christopher Titus, known for his comedic roles, is excellent as the father and brother who must hold the remaining family together. The acting, coupled with the flashback scenes, make this movie worth watching, just not getting excited for.",1302480000,10,3191,4.6155202821869485
4333780,3,B004DNWPKS,"How far would you go to save your friend?  After finally returning to her hometown after escaping a serial killer, Joan (Bettis) notices things that are all too familier.  This movie goes back and forth between flashbacks and present day.  As a teen Joan and her best friend are taken and brutaly tortured by a sadistic man.  In order to get the torture to stop Joan must tell him to kill her friend.  Upon returning to her hometown, Joan begins to witness dead bodies piling up and it seems all too familier.  She begins to wonder if the person she thought she killed years ago is actually dead.  Honstly I expected this to be totally lame.  It was not that bad.  It was very gory, but it also had a plot, which doesn't always go hand-in-hand.  The use of flashback is pretty well done.  This is not an edge-of-your-seat type movie, but it will keep you watching until the end, as well as keep you entertained. This is another movie this week that surprised me.  I give it a B-.",1301356800,,979,4.377777777777778

4333829,3,B004DNWPKS,"Not great, not terrible. I am a fan of movies with strong female leads, and this one is decent. The acting was typical horror movie style with some bad dialogue. The actors are mostly no-names, except for Christopher Titus, the comedian. I wasn't expecting to see him in a horror role. I have to admit, he's not a terrible actor. The characters are also pretty typical: Joan, the main character, was abducted and actually did a decent job playing a woman obviously suffering from PTSD; Olympia is Joan's teenage niece with major attitude, stays out past curfew, doesn't listen to anyone; Paul is Olympia's love interest, who does a so-so job but is definitely not there for eye candy.

I agree with some of the other posts that this is highly predictable. It was fairly obvious who the assailant was, right from the moment he was introduced. If I had made the movie, I would have tried to figure out a more believable way to make it so that Joan doesn't know who he is. That's all I'm saying.

If you're interested in some gore, a little action, and some silly dialogue, this isn't bad. If you're looking for an Oscar winner, well it's kind of obvious, leave this one alone.",1456099200,,1174,4.559241706161138

4333855,3,B004DNWPKS,"This is worth watching if you're a fan of Angela Bettis, as I am (best performer ever!), or if an interesting and quite twisted horror scenario is sufficient to get you through a movie. It is visually interesting in the way it uses a drab palette to create a heavy, mournful atmosphere. The weakest part is the writing. The dialogue seldom rings true and if you reflect at all on the plot you'll realize pretty soon how contrived it is--contrived by making characters make too-stupid-to-believe choices in order to push the film in the direction its makers' intended it to go: an exploration of PTSD, torture (this movie is very much a political reaction to the revelations of overseas torture committed by US military personnel under George W Bush), society's tendency to blame the victimthat's a pretty ambitious list, and it's nice to see a film that's willing to take such things seriously, but this film ultimately takes itself too seriously. There are dashes of dark, slightly surreal humor now and then, such as the Fish Day celebration or the museum reverently dedicated to the memory of a serial torturer and murderer, but these are underdevelopedand in the meantime the film gives itself too much intellectual credit when one of the characters claims that his psychological game ""boils all philosophy down to just one simple question!""

Anyway, like I said, Angela Bettis really does deliver a performance worth watching, that tiny frame containing that huge emotional reservoir, those eyes always taking everything in with such intelligence, and that intense focus that brings each of the roles she plays into the highest of definitions. If you haven't seen her work before, there are many better films than this one.",1431475200,,1728,5.0

To me it seems like a directors first time shooting a full feature so don't go in watching it expecting the full financial force of Hollywood color grading or feel. That being said this is the same production company that did ""Lean on Me"" with Morgan Freemen. The opening credits for the movie where excellently done and did well introducing us to the characters of the film. The cinematography was excellent in my opinion, as well was the editing. When watching the film it's easy to feel that the director could have gotten much more out of his actors, as we have seen them all give much better performances in other works they have done. The story is in the vein of classic 80's teen scream slasher horror, and was very enjoyable. The bloody gags where a nice change of pace in this modern horror world as they where not all digital, and many of the scenes seemed to have buckets of corn syrup and dye on hand for there priceable photography. The story seemed to be very flashback heavy which distracted from the ""in the present"" timeline but none the less it held my attention.

This product, by an outfit called Phase Four, is lousy. I had assumed that it was a two-sided DVD with 2-D on one side and 3-D on the other. Instead, the makers superimposed both formats on a one-sided disc. The result is crappy 3-D with those lousy 3-D cellophane glasses and a ruined 2-D version.

As you probably know, movies made for those red-blue glasses look too dark. To compensate, the video transfer was made much too light for 2-D. It's washed out and the highlights are hopelessly blown out. The video transfer is just miserably bad.

To add insult to injury, this product also included a couple of obnoxious trailers which I COULD NOT skip over. If you've ever run into such trailers you know how miserable it is to sit through five minutes of garbage, at every viewing. This practice is evil.

I went back to Amazon and found a possible original 2-D version...Used. It has cost me another $5 but will be worth it if it's truly 2-D.",1414108800,,1120,4.52970297029703

4333880,4,B004DNWPKS,"Scar is not your typical indie horror/slasher flick for many reasons like its writing, direction, locations and overall production values.
The story is interesting enough and will keep the viewer attention for what or who's next on the list. The story isn't a brain teaser nor will it give you a headache to try and figure out, but it is entertaining and that alone is worth the time to watch this blood fest.
The actors do a fairly good job of telling and selling this tourture filled story in two parts (past and present) through flashbacks/nightmares of a survivor Joan (Bettis) from the first attacks. I know its kinda vauge for a reason (no spoilers allowed) and it wouldn't take much to give away all the gory details.
Not long after Joan Burrows (Bettis) returns home after an extended absence to see her brother Jeff (Titus) and his daughter Olympia (Blanton) do things start to happen. People are missing and one is found dead at an annual event. This is enough for Joan (who hasn't recovered from her attack and survival) to start telling everyone that the attacks are starting again, but it can't be or can it ???
The movie has a fair amount of cursing including the F...word and violence. It also has scenes of tourture (although not as severe as some recent movies) with gallons of blood that is at times somewhat graphic. There is also a topless nude scene of a girl trying to get her boyfriends attention? 4 stars for a good attempt with somewhat limited resources that otherwise would score this movie 3 stars.
Ps. I'm a big fan of Chris Titus although he doesn't provide any comic relief in this story.",1407456000,2,1619,4.625
4333881,5,B004DNWPKS,"Having seen Angela Bettis in one of the remakes of the popular ""Carrie"" movies, I was familiar with her acting style from the onset.  However, I was totally unprepared for this.

The scene...Joan Burrows is a teenager, lured into the work place of a popular mortician, Ernie Bishop, with her best friend, Susie Thomas in order to get Joan's banged-up knee patched up.  Bishop, a nice-looking, courteous man perhaps in his late 20's or early 30's from first glance, gains the girls' trust and is soon flirted with by Joan.  Under the premise of getting ointment and bandages for Joan's knee, Susie follows Bishop down to the morgue and is not seen again until later.  ""So you're not bothered by the sight of blood?"" asks Bishop to Joan.  When she replies ""No, not really"", Bishop covers her nose and mouth with a chloroform-soaked cloth and she's soon knocked out cold.  Later, she wakes up in the morgue next to Susie who is covered in blood and slashes from shoulders to toes, tied down to an autopsy table by rubber tubing like Susie is.  This is where it gets a bit gruesome, so I recommend you don't watch this part alone or if you happen to love jumpy moments like I do, then by all means...!

Bishop decides to play a game with the two girls and tortures them each in turn, saying that the only way the game will stop is if one of them demands that he kill the other.  Best friends, neither girl can say it, until Bishop cuts out Susie's tongue and is about to do the same to terrified Joan.  I won't spoil the ending for you, however I will say that the twist at the end is TOTALLY worth it and in the style of true slasher films, there's blood and gore galore, with a few gratuitous tit shots.

I'm a fan of all types of horror flicks, mainly because I love trying to tear them apart logically, but there are times when I just crave a good old fashioned scare fest and this definitely gives you that.  There are scream-worthy moments and some groan-worthy ones, a healthy dose of each through the entire film, but all in all, I would completely and totally recommend this to anyone who loves movies like this.",1405641600,2,2117,4.425257731958763
4333882,2,B004DNWPKS,"This is only for use in 3D with the blue and red 3D glasses not active shutter glasses but even worse the photography is not suitable for 3D. In dark scenes especially in the last 25 minutes or so the blacks are so crushed the black becomes blue and bleed all over everything. The photography often has soft focus which is horrible in 3D and the action tends to jerk around like a Michael Bay movie which also is really hard on your eyes in 3D. After 20 minutes, I had to switch out to 2D to avoid a splitting headache.

As a slasher/thriller movie, it is not too bad but it also not very original either but even here the photography is poor even in 2D.

Ben Cotton as (Bishop) was effective as the serial killer who kidnaps Bettis' character (Joan) and her best friend years earlier trying to pit them against each other by playing a deadly game with them. Joan assumes she has killed Bishop,little does she know she is about to re reunited with him again.

The gore was well done and pretty plentiful,there was just something about it besides Angela's presence that made me like it and I've watched it 3 times so far. The cat and mouse between Joan and Bishop was very entertaining and nerve wracking and suspenseful. Of course there is a twist that is not expected but wasn't that big of a revelation either.

4333888,3,B004DNWPKS,"Joan Burrows (Angela Bettis looking like a roughed up version of Christina Ricci) returns to her home town of Ovid for a reunion with family. She is haunted by past memories (and a facial scar), about a weird slasher named Bishop (Ben Cotton) who killed her friend as well as giving her a scar. The flashbacks are used to make comparisons with Bishop, the killer, and somewhat creepy kid named Paul (Devon Graye) who is a friend of her niece Olympia (Kirby Bliss Blanton). Paul's dad (James D. Hopkin) is a bit of a psycho from being in Iraq.

Meanwhile teens have a graduation party. Drinking, pot smoking, and a girl(thank you Kristin Kowalski) who strips down to her panties and says, ""Howard! Come here and take my virginity. I'm not graduating with it!""

As in any good teen slasher movie, kids by the lake who want to have sex... The body count rises, but we don't get to see the killer, nor the kids being tortured. Instead we get flashbacks to the Burrows/Bishop torture. Don't worry, if you missed Joan Burrows getting her face cut, they show it again. The theme of the murders is ""would you kill a friend to save yourself."" However the movie rarely delves into that theme, rather it just shows us dead bodies.

The film culminates in a far too predictable poorly written ending.",1342569600,,1288,4.591304347826087
4333889,3,B004DNWPKS,"For starters, if you're getting this movie to have an inexpensive flick to feed your brand new 3D set-up, then pick another. This movie is presented in an anaglyphic format (Red-Blue glasses), and doesn't take advantage of either active shutter or passive (""cinema"") 3d systems. As for the quality of the anaglyphic 3D (I bypassed the included cardboard and cellophane glasses and used the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-blue-Cyan-Anaglyph-Simple-style-3D-Glasses/dp/B003LWYGPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red-blue / Cyan Anaglyph Simple style 3D Glasses</a>&nbsp;that I bought for watching 3D content on YouTube), prepare for a lot of ghosting that comes and goes. The red-blue tinting aside, some shots seem perfectly produced with a rich, deep 3D effect, only to cut to another angle with severe ghosting and no real dimension to speak of. At about 15 minutes into the movie, the disappearing/reappearing ghosting got so annoying that I switched out to 2D to finish the movie.

As to the movie itself, it's a passable low-budget modern grindhouse flick. It's an HD flick, but with that grainy, well-used quality of low-budget cinema everywhere. The writing and acting aren't particularly stellar, but they're earnest. It's refreshing to see a low budget horror feature that didn't opt for comedy in lieu of being able to produce real scares, but instead tried to deliver the best experience it could.

The much-touted gore in other reviews is primarily off-camera with two or three notable exceptions. What you do get are buckets and buckets of blood. Blood-drenched clothes, blood-splattered walls, and off-camera jets of blood spraying the characters down -- usually followed by a brief glimpse of the aftermath of whatever generated said jets (often not nearly as bad as what your imagination cooked up while it was off-camera). It's no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-3D-The-Final-Chapter/dp/B004FEFZU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw 3D: The Final Chapter</a>, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

4333890,2,B004DNWPKS,"Obvious in every regard; Scar has very little style and not much substance and certainly nothing new to offer the torture genre.  It didn't help that there was absolutely no attempt at suspense, just cheap kills.  As far as the story goes, the past and present are doled out in stages, like shuffling a deck of cards (and just about as interesting).  The characters aren't involving; most are archetypes, there to suit the purpose of a cloyingly slim premise: the hometown return of the only survivor (Angela Bettis as Joan Burrows) of a serial killer.  The minute she steps foot in the vicinity, the killings begin again, thus making her the ONLY suspect.  In this little town of nowhere, forensics is never applied, nor is a great deal of thought.  The movie simply stumbles to a clumsy ending/reveal that can be seen coming from miles away.
The filmmakers' astounding reliance on standard horror gimmicks results in a complete lack of originality (however did they get funding for this dud?).  I'm sure it looked much worse on paper than as filmed.

My reaction is less about the graphic nature of this film and more about the slipshod way it was made.  Utterly pointless, unless seen as an exercise in futility.",1333756800,,1215,4.77511961722488

There are no real cringe scenes, although some are real close! A very good torture/ slasher film. You really need to pay attention, as there are flashback scenes, present scenes, and some dream scenes, and the movie doesn't tell you what you are seeing, you have to figure it out for yourself. This is much better than the usual slasher type flick. There is blood, some gore, but nothing over the top or unbelievable, which just goes to make it more chilling and believable. Immagine you are strapped to a stainless steel gurney, your best friend is strapped to another next to you! The bad man inflicts progressively more cruel tortures on you and your friend.

  That set aside, this movie is from an independant company that we used to call B-movies and for a B-movie really isn't that bad. The writing and acting isn't horrible and really worth watching if you can stand really bloody violence. For some reason Christopher Titus got roped into this movie which was a suprise but probably just to sell discs and actually did a pretty good job.

Waifish Angela Bettis (MAY and TV Movie's CARRIE) is Joan, the lone survivor of a psychotic mortician's killing spree, who returns home for her niece's homecoming, only to trigger more killings.
Devon Graye (in the excellent HUSK and TV's teenage DEXTER) plays Paul, the bashful nerd who befriends Joan's niece Olympia. Graye's developing into a mature actor--expect to see more of him.  Ben Cotton, a victim on HARPER's ISLAND, is frightening as the ghoulish undertaker.  The rest of the cast is effective and the movie holds your interest.  SCAR, made in 2007, positS THE question ""Will you let someone die to save your own life?""--sort of a companion to all the SAW movies.
SCAR is disturbing and violent and Bettis earns our sympathy.
