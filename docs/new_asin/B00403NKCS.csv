will literally watch anything and find something good about.",1475625600,2,160,4.551724137931035
4237901,1,B00403NKCS,"Oh my, Oh my, Oh my...  A blow to the actors, directors and, screenplay writers everywhere.  If it was a high school class assignment;  good effort.",1475539200,4,148,4.615384615384615
4237902,5,B00403NKCS,"Melanie Robel is Remarkable as Jan, the Slightly Disturbed Daughter of an Abusive Father, who Becomes an Avenger of Abusers, Aliens, & WhatEver Else Comes to Her Distracted Mind ! She makes Jan into a completely sympathetic figure, who can change her emotions on a dime; & also bring Great Humor to the Role !!! Her one liners are Classic ! Colin Bowman Portrays the Miserable Dad & the Body for the Alien; & does so with aplomb !
  Christina Daoust, as Nina, & Sarah Doerr, as Maureen, are Jan's Perfectly Lovely Friends; & Both Add to the Horror/Comedy Mood of the Film . AJ Jones & Jesse Kozel are John & Harry, the BoyFriends; & do an excellent job of Contributing to the Madness !Debbie Rochon is Col. Onyx, who is Flying Around in a Helicopter [of sorts] with Agent Blade [Shade Burnett] Seeking the Alien & Providing Some BackGround & Some Laughs ! The Director, Jason Liquori, even does a Relatively Straight Stint as Deputy Lawrence, trying to Figure Out what the Heck is Going on !
  The Whole Thing makes for Great Fun with a Unique SyFy Twist; & Leaves Open the Possibility of a Much Desired Sequel !!!",1475452800,,1114,4.5
4237903,5,B00403NKCS,"There was some trouble with the audio moving from really loud to barely audible, so that was a little distracting. This film was obviously low budget and had some technical glitches, but it kept my interest and I laughed many times. It was campy and fun. The acting was great, and there were some funny one-liners. I think it set out to do what it was meant to do, which was to provide some amusement and not take itself too seriously. Hooray tentacles!",1472688000,,453,4.469879518072289
4237904,4,B00403NKCS,"This is a low budget movie. In many ways low budget movies are a lot more interesting than most multimillion dollar products because they can't  cover up a bad story, plot holes and ridiculous acting with expensive computer wizardry so they have to rely on what has always been the core of every film from the very beginning: a good story, a well written script, a director with a vision and great actors. The special effects are maybe not of Michael Bay standards, but if you like that stuff and you don't care about the complete lack of storytelling or character development and the extremely two-dimensional acting often seen in those films you are probably not the right audience for Alien Vengeance.
If you are interested in films that go beyond the emptiness that we find in the multiplexes most of the time, if you love movies made with love for the art of moviemaking instead of for the money, if you can't get enough of the works of directors like Lloyd Kaufman, H.G. Lewis, Jean Rollin, Andrew Repasky McElhinney or Jess Franco. Than I'd strongly recommend Alien Vengeance to you.

As far as I know this is the first feature length film of Jason Liqori. Liqori has been a very prolific photographer for many years before taking on directing, and this shows in his cinematography. The camera-angles are sometimes very surprising, heightening the atmosphere of the movie. He has assembled a cast of young actors along with some veterans in the industry, most importantly fan favorite Debbie Rochon who, as always, delivers a performance that still makes me wonder how it is possible she doesn't have the fame a lot of less talented actors have gained. But the one who really steals the show is Melanie Robel as Jan, the central figure in the story.
I won't give away too much if I say Jan is quite a disturbed person, due to her harsh life's circumstances. The way she slowly keeps falling apart emotionally during the movie is portrayed by Melanie Robel so horrifyingly believable, that it reminds me of Annabella Sciorra's brilliant performance in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. Closely watch her also when she is in the frame but without dialogue and you see what I mean.
Director Jason Liqori makes use of the special effects his budget allows inventively, and they work well because the movie does not rely on them and probably even more because he makes such brilliant use of his good eye for cinematography and fantastic choices in when to show and when not to show events. This becomes clear immediately during the opening scene, which could -and in lesser hands would- have been depicted in an over the top sleaze- and/or gore fest, but Liqori's restraint is extremely more effective and drags the viewer into the film with an in-your-face attitude that would otherwise have ruined the entire atmosphere and the empathy we now have for the central character of Jan.

If your interest goes beyond the popcorny fun of ridiculously expensive but emotionally empty blockbusters I'd highly recommend this one!",1328572800,,3022,4.8076923076923075
4237905,1,B00403NKCS,At the same time I ordered this movie and its sequel. The original was beyond terrible and approached petty theft. I cannot remember ever seeing a worse movie....unless it was the sequel. Avoid this movie like the plague.,1317859200,,221,4.842105263157895
4237906,1,B00403NKCS,The movie may or may not have had a good plot but the sound tract is so bad that I could not sit through the entire film.  In order to hear the actor's words the sound has to be turned up so incredibly loud that when the 'mood' music comes in it blasts you out of your chair.,1298764800,,275,3.7413793103448274

8411852,4,B00403NKCS,"Alien Vengeance tells the story of Jan, a troubled young woman with a psychotically abusive father, who encounters an alien that crash lands on Earth not far from her home.  Its when four other youths cross paths with the alien and Jan that the real trouble begins.  Theres no shortage of comedic situations or funny dialogue and it end with a straight cliffhanger.  Im not sure what other people were expecting, as I look at some of the other reviews of this film, but what I can tell you is this; if you enjoy films where you can see how much effort the filmmaker(s) put in and enjoy a good story, youll like this film.  I challenge you to make a film on your own, with your own money before you decide to give this film series or any other no/low-budget film a totally negative review.  Too often do I see no/low-budget film where the story is lacking, and thats the backbone of any good film.  Filmmaking and storytelling are an art that many people are passionate about but not everyone gets right. It's also hard work.  That's the thing that people don't realize, it really is HARD WORK on any level, and even harder when you lack a multi-million dollar budget. So me personally, I will always look for the good in any film I watch, and see/appreciate it when I see the effort there.",1495929600,,1289,4.436440677966102
