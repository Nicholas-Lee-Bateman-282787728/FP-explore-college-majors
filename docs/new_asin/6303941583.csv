7856326,5,6303941583,This is the perfect for a Cowboys fan who can't step foot into the 21st-century,1502928000,,79,4.333333333333333
7856327,3,6303941583,"Good video. Good recreation of the Dallas Cowboys winning their 3rd Super Bowl in 4 years. Shows Super Bowl 30 between the Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, a rematch of Super Bowl 10. Has Barry Switzer winning a Super Bowl after replacing Jimmy Johnson, along with Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irwin. A must for Cowboys fans.",1390953600,,335,4.894736842105263
7856328,5,6303941583,I love this video. It was great for me especially to see the cowboys beat the Pittsburgh Steelers at least in one superbowl after losing to them twice in the seventies.,1386028800,,168,4.451612903225806
7856329,5,6303941583,Personally being a die hard Bronco fan and seeing John Elway in his deserved moment of glory was a tear jerker for me. Anyone who knows films knows this is not the game but the highlights and they were great!...,1015718400,,211,4.3
7856330,2,6303941583,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  Considering the capabilities of the medium (even in 1998), the video is much too short, and contains far too little of the actual game.  When I purchased it, I expected the complete game-and got a few highlights and statistics. Do not buy this DVD; the VHS video of the Broncos Super Bowl XXXII victory is far superior-and costs much less.  The DVD is a ripoff-period.",1013212800,5,406,4.611111111111111
7856331,4,6303941583,"Even though I was expecting to receive the whole game on DVD and not just the highlights, the DVD image quality compared to VHS and its other features make this a must for any Broncos fan.  While everyone has seen the video replay of Elway's famous ""helicopter"" dive for a first down late in the 4th quarter to set up the winning score, this DVD let's you see it from 8 different camera angles. Moreover, NFL films does a great job on many other key plays of the game.  For those Bronco fans who want to keep the memories alive forever of the greatest Super Bowl ever played (no other Super Bowl has been tied 3 times--at 7, 17, and 24) the quality of this DVD, versus the VHS tapes which came out after the game, make this a must to own and enjoy every year at Super Bowl time!",978307200,7,778,4.18
7856332,1,6303941583,"As a Bronco and DVD fanatic, I had high hopes for this disk.  I was greatly disappointed.
This DVD was originally only available as a freebie from RCA when you bought one of their players.  Now that Polygram Video is  distributing it (and asking over $20 for it), the RCA commercial that twice  hijacked my player, and the ever-present RCA logo in the lower-right corner  of the screen seemed intrusive and out-of-place.
The ""Game""  section of the disk contains a recap that is a little over 19 minutes long.  The video quality is no higher than a decent VHS tape, and the icons that  alert the user to special features (such as multiple angles) are way too  large and distracting.
The rest of the disk's content is paltry, and  requires tedious navigation to access.
NFL Films can do much better with  the DVD format.  How about a longer, more in-depth recap of the game, or  video-intensive player bios (like the Elway: Champion Forever video now  available)? Or, better yet, what if the entire game were on DVD, complete  with audio tracks from the radio and TV broadcasters, on-field microphones,  etc.?  Such a disk would require a lot of collaboration, but it would be  worth the $20 I wasted on this title.",919209600,39,1213,4.668246445497631
