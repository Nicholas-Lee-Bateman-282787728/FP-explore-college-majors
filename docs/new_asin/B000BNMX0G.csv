2429484,1,B000BNMX0G,"I bought this 4 disk set only to discover that disk #1 wouldn't load at all, and the last two episodes on disk four wouldn't play. It was sent back for an exchange. The second set was the same exact thing. After returning that one for a second exchange, the third set was defective in the same manner. Since I tried three copies and they were all defective in the same places, I returned the last one for an refund. This is too bad as I love Mister Peepers.

S'more Entertainment needs better quality control. It's hard to believe they aren't aware the of these major problems. Beware!",1134777600,18,585,4.416666666666667
2429485,5,B000BNMX0G,"In the late 1940s and early 1950s, much of television production was broadcast live and, prior to a nationwide feed, kinescopes (films of live broadcasts from television monitors) were made as a way to broadcast shows at a later date in different parts of the country and, in some cases, for later syndication purposes.  Unfortunately, many of the kinescopes from early television shows were either lost or destroyed and, consequently, a good portion of early American television history has been lost to the ages.  Thankfully, this is not the case with ""Mister Peepers,"" one of television's earliest weekly situation comedies.  Supposedly, 102 episodes out of a total series production of 127 reside at the UCLA Film & Television Archive and, from this collection, comes this first TV-on-DVD release from S'more Entertainment, a new DVD releasing company.

This set includes the first 26 episodes of the series along with the series' pilot, which features an unbilled Walter Matthau in the role of ""Mr. Burr,"" Jefferson Junior High's coach (Matthau would not become a series regular).  In addition to Matthau, the series featured up-and-coming stars like Tony Randall and Jack Warden.  Marion Lorne, later ""Aunt Clara"" in ""Bewitched,"" is also in the cast.  But the show really belongs to Wally Cox.  Unlike the cynical and often tasteless humor found in many modern sitcoms, there's a ""kinder, gentler"" humor found in ""Mister Peepers,"" and Cox is just perfect in the role of Robinson Peepers, the good-hearted science teacher.  Technically, the shows are crude when compared to modern day productions.  While very watchable, there are some scratches and film specks from time-to-time (one of the early episodes has a bad scratch for a long portion) and there is noticeable audio hiss present on some episodes.  And, unfortunately, the UCLA Film & Television logo appears from time-to-time in the bottom right hand corner (couldn't this have been done on the credits only).  But the positives of this DVD set far outweigh the negatives and what really shines through on ""Mister Peepers"" is both the wonderful writing and ensemble acting by a very talented cast performing live.  In addition to the pilot episode, there are some other extras on the DVD set that, while not essential, enhance one's appreciation of Wally Cox and the show.

""Mister Peepers"" is highly recommended for both fans of early sitcoms as well as anyone interested in early American live television broadcasting.  From a historical perspective, this is one of the most important TV-on-DVD releases available on the market.  Let's hope that S'more episodes from this wonderful comedy series are released in the future.",1132012800,84,2689,5.175519630484988
2429486,5,B000BNMX0G,Enjoying Mr. Peepers is an acquired taste but it is a sweet and well done though somewhat offbeat series. BUYER BEWARE--the company issuing the series could be more receptive to  their customers. I received the wrong insert information in one of the season I purchased. I wrote the company to try to correct this but they ignored me. Other reviewers noted mislabeled or not functioning disks ; I did not experience that problem so they may have corrected that problem. A set of the series at my local library had to be pulled from the library because of the disks not working or being mislabeled Quality control could be better and a reply to my concerns would have been appreciated--after all I did pay for their product and it should be packaged correctly or made correct if need be.

The sound isn't always great, but the copyright is 1952, so I don't expect perfection. I'm so pleased that these old programs are available.

2429493,4,B000BNMX0G,"Being familiar with kinescopes and having read the earlier reviews, I was concerned that the technical quality of these DVD's might not be very good.  After watching the ""Bonus"" pilot and the first broadcast episode, however, I must say that for a kinescope (or, as the original NBC credit identified the process, ""KinePhoto""), the picture quality is actually very nice.  The sound quality, while generally tolerable, is less admirable (with the epilogue of Episode 1 having hardly any sound at all), so I am glad to read that this will improve in subsequent episodes.

The pilot is a rough draft of Episode 1, which is clearly more polished.  I do think, though, that the pilot's stronger emphasis on a particular quirk of one of the characters made the outcome seem more appropriate.  Like MissPammy, Hubby and I enjoyed Walter Matthau's performance as the coach in the pilot.  (A different actor is credited, but Internet Movie Database verifies that it really was Matthau.)  And if anyone else is trying to place the tune used several times in the pilot, it's ""Our Boys Will Shine,"" a popular song at high-school pep rallies for the past hundred years.  Added:  In a later episode, the school song is set to this tune.

""Mr. Peepers"" will not appeal to everyone.  As has been noted by others, those who prefer slapstick humor, burlesque characters, and loud dialog will be happier with ""I Love Lucy.""  This very low-key series could be considered a somewhat primitive forerunner of more character-oriented sitcoms like ""The Dick Van Dyke Show.""",1306800000,4,1548,4.934362934362935
2429494,4,B000BNMX0G,"Mr. Peepers was a favorite of my family.  My sister loved Wally Cox and all the characters in this show, so I gave it to her as a gift.

2429495,2,B000BNMX0G,"The 1950's precursor to videotape, Kinescope, was employed recording this show, and that's unfortunate because there are profound soundtrack and image quality issues throughout.  It's another reminder how wise Lucy and Desi were to actually film I Love Lucy.. don't expect the quality seen on reruns of that show here.  In fact, the sound was completely out of synch throughout every show in the set.  To even watch it I had to avoid looking directly at the players' faces as they spoke.

Cox's Peepers is a sweet, gentle, amusing character -likeable from the start.  When there's physical comedy the show is best, but the unfamiliarity of television makes for some awkward moments for otherwise seasoned actors.  I am glad I got a taste of what the show had to offer but the quality is so poor I cannot recommend it, nor will I buy season 2.

Thank you so much for your kind note. Sadly, the DVD market has shrunk to the point where we can no longer sell enough product to justify the cost of transferring from film to video, digitizing and then restoring the elements, let alone the cost of authoring the DVD and creating packaging.

2429497,1,B000BNMX0G,I was dissapointed in  the quality of the video. I realize it may just be that it is from the early days of TV. Also the humor that I thought was funny then seems a little corny now. I would not recommend it.,1234569600,,208,3.8372093023255816

Just lay your head back sometime and think back of growing up and going to High School then this is the DVD you want to watch. I believe I have already watched it twice. Mr. Peepers as the high School teacher being harassed and made fun of every day and how he wiggles his way out of every situation you will love it.

2429499,4,B000BNMX0G,"I barely remembered the Mr. Peepers show before I bought this set, and now I'm enchanted by it.  Wally Cox's mild-mannered character is hilarious, Marion Lorne is sensational as the principal's wife, and Tony Randall plays the girl-magnet funny guy to the hilt.  As a show from the fifties, it's a slower-paced show but with excellent comedic timing, and it may not appeal to people unaccustomed to subtle humor.  For those who can appreciate that, though, it's a gem.  The sound quality at the beginning of the very first program is poor, and there are other glitches here and there, undoubtedly due to the fact that the series was salvaged from the old technology of the day, but I wouldn't trade my set for anything.  I've watched some of the episodes over and over, and I'm looking forward with bated breath to the 2nd boxed set, which is due out in November 2008.  On that one, we'll see Mr. Peepers marry Nancy, an episode that topped the charts for viewing back when it originally aired.  An added bonus is seeing the clothes, hairdos, and decor from the fifties, which all bring back great memories.  In sum, this set is full of delicious little comedic moments, all set in the nostalgic fifties.  This is really a five-star set, but due to the minor quality issues I gave it four stars.  I love it!  I think you will too.",1221091200,3,1330,4.569620253164557
2429500,1,B000BNMX0G,"I LOVE CLASSIC TV LIKE I LOVE LUCY, SGT. BILKO, AND LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, BUT MR. PEEPERS IS SUCH A YAWNER AND WAS VERY POORLY PRODUCED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AT THE TIME. BORING!!!",1216252800,2,185,4.314285714285714
2429501,5,B000BNMX0G,"The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy ""Mr. Peepers"" were originally broadcast from 1952-55 on NBC. Like a lot of baby boomers this and ""Ding Dong School"" are my earliest memories of television. Since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts.

""Mr. Peepers"" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value. It represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like ""The Honeymooners"" and ""I Love Lucy"". The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows; which is probably why they still seem somewhat contemporary.

""Mr. Peepers"", which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone, may appear slow and dull in comparison. But it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style. Once you get into the characters it should hold the interest of intelligent viewers. Credit should be give to the show's producer, Fred Coe, a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out (""Philco Television Playhouse"", ""Lights Out"", ""Playhouse 90"", ""Producers Showcase"", ""Playwrights 56"", ""Fireside Theatre"", etc.) even on kinescope.

""Mr. Peepers"" offered a much more gentle style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of ""Underdog"" a few years later) in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a mild-mannered high school science teacher. His glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer.

The series provided Cox with an outstanding supporting cast. Tony Randall played his brash best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements.

There is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), with viewers quickly aligning with Mr. Peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle Nancy. Their on-screen marriage near the end 1953-54 season captured national attention, an early version of the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" frenzy.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1204070400,11,2217,5.144444444444445
2429502,4,B000BNMX0G,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, from his wish list, so I didn't know what to expect. The first one, or two of the shows from the series was damaged due to poor storage, and the sound isn't very good. But you can still understand what's going on. After that, the quality improves and the shows are as funny as I remember them. What a treat to have this piece of television history at our disposal. If you're a Baby Boomer and ever watched TV as a kid, this is truly a walk down memory lane. I hadn't remembered that Tony Randall was a regular on the show, and a bit of interesting trivia is that Wally Cox (Mr. Peepers), was close and personal friend of Marlon Brando. And I must add that Marion Lorne is perfect as the dottering school marm. She had perfected her routine to a science and a signature (or perhaps she was just dotty). At any rate, I recommend this set very highly.",1198195200,15,888,4.1988304093567255
2429503,5,B000BNMX0G,"This DVD set is really fun to watch.  Wally Cox is utterly charming as Mr. Peepers, and his comedic timing is perfection.  The hilarious predicaments he gets into are slightly offbeat and entertaining.  The rest of the cast is excellent, too, particularly the dithering Marion Lorne and the great actors Walter Matthau and Tony Randall.  I intended to just watch the first couple of shows and then save the rest for later, but I couldn't stop watching.  Now I've watched them all twice, and I've only had the set for two days.  This set was recorded from the original kinescopes, which were all that was available, and in the first show and a couple of subsequent ones, there is some difficulty hearing the words in a place or two.  The series is also in black and white, of course, but these drawbacks are minimal compared to the quality of the acting. I can't get enough of Mr. Peepers, and now I'm going to be waiting for the second boxed set to come out so that we can see him get married.",1191369600,12,993,4.45303867403315

2429505,2,B000BNMX0G,"I love fifties television and am looking forward to seeing ""Our Miss Brooks"" and ""The Life Of Riley"" released on DVD some day. Both shows ran for years on radio and television. Mr. Peepers ran for two years and then tanked. I can see why. While Wally Cox was good at delivering his lines, this character was too one dimensional and the show was too slow moving to  sustain itself in a long run. Mr. Peepers shoulld have been a secondary character in a bigger show, for example, Mr. Peepers might have been another teacher at Madison High School where Miss Brooks (Eve Arden) worked. Early tv fans will need to see an apisode or two of this but even I couldn't get interested enough to watch all of these.",1176681600,4,704,4.415384615384616
2429506,5,B000BNMX0G,"This is an absolutely delightful, subtle, and twee comedy from the year 1952.  It will prove odd to many juveniles; there are no car chases, explosions, four letter words, or sex scenes.  You have to pay attention to the dialogue, which is spoken not shouted.  Mr. Peepers is a gentle and kind junior high science teacher, and the world seems to get the better of him...but not for long.  Wally Cox is one of a kind, and so is Marion Lorne, who plays the principal's wife.  Tony Randall and Jack Warden make guest appearances in these live performances, and they are entertaining.  But in every episode, Cox is the focus, and his low-key humor can't be matched by anyone...at any time.  This is wonderful television from a much kinder and quieter era.",1173398400,54,751,4.643939393939394
2429507,4,B000BNMX0G,"The previous reviewer, Bennet Pomerantz, is mixed up about early TV time shifting techniques. In the early 1950s the only method available for recording live TV was the Kinescope process, in which a 16mm or 35mm film camera was mounted in front of a television monitor and the program was recorded on film, not tape. Although Bing Crosby Enterprizes experimented with a crude form of video tape as early as 1951, the picture quality was unacceptable. Usable video tape didn't become available until 1956 when Ampex introduced the first video tape recorders. Desilu Productions early on decided to film the I Love Lucy shows instead of airing them live, because non networked TV outlets complained about the poor quality of the Kinescope filmed copies that other live shows gave them to air. Thus directly filming shows instead of presenting them live while simultaneously recording them on Kinescope film for immediate rebroadcast became popular. Some artists, such as Jackie Gleason, insisted that all their Kinescopes be saved for use many years in the future. That's why all the Gleason shows, and aparently these Peepers Kinescopes too, are still with us. Many of the Kinescopes that were ""bicycled"" to outlying affiliates survived, but most were either trashed or just plain lost. The shows that were directly filmed instead of broadcast live and Kinescoped had a much better chance of survival, and the picture quality is vastly better. Just how good these Mister Peepers DVDs will look and sound is yet to be discovered when they are released. I hope the studio did a good job on them, because I recall watching this show with my dad in the early '50s and we really enjoyed it. I hope they include the vintage commercials too.",1166400000,28,1733,4.958762886597938
2429508,5,B000BNMX0G,"In the 1950's,  Tv was live. It was theater in a video format. The idea of video taping was done by Desi Arnaz and Lucy for I LOVE LUCY. However most of the shows of the early 1950's were recorded  on kinadcope (a form of rerecordable video tape). These tapes were most of the time wiped clean to record again, this is why we lost most of the classic TV  shows of the 1950

However someone , I do not know who, at the film library of USLA (University of Southern California Los Angeles) found the tapes of Mr Peepers and restore them.

The series is the story of the  mild mannered Jefferson Peepers, who  is an everyman that life happens to him. Good deeds goes bad ro Peepers, by in the end it all works out.

Wally Cox underplays Peepers with charms and makes you want to win in the end. Such actors as Tony Randall, Water Matthau and Jack Warden made their first YV appeareance on the Peeper's show and you can seem on these first 26 episodes of this classic series.

So does this show hold up after 50 years, in one word--YES! Does  rate with some  of today's comedies-I think it is better, you see where the humor of the past is mimiced in the present

Maybe if the kids can handle the black and white show, slip this DVD in their family viewing , they may enjoy this as much as Full House, The Nanny or The Fact of Life. However for adults, this show is great Television at its best

Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD

Would someone ask S'Mores Entertainment to release a second volume soon?",1164844800,15,1493,4.285714285714286
2429509,4,B000BNMX0G,"Sadly, someone really did screw up in the packaging of this one; my first set was a mess with mislabelled disks and two with the same episodes, meaning seven episodes were missing; I got a replacement from Amazon and it was fine -- except for some reason there was an extra fifth disk that was a copy of another one. That's why I am giving the set four stars. So check your disks when you get your set, but then...

Savor one of the very few fifties sitcoms that holds up (and even though I'm an I LOVE LUCY fan, even that show is getting so old that the fascination is increasingly anthropological rather than a true, direct delight in the ""wacky"" goings on). PEEPERS has the sweet fifties-whimsical tone of GERALD MCBOING BOING or HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON. Wally Cox's portrayal is, in its way, a kind of less tortured proto-Stephen Wright.

And then you get a young Tony Randall (or Anthony Randall, as he is first billed) using his stage smarts to breathe incredible life into the character of Peepers' colleague and friend. In addition, the unearthing of these shows means that anyone who has ever loved Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara on BEWITCHED or enjoyed her memorable turn as the mother in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN now gets two-dozen-plus new performances by her; her dithery shtick steals many an episode. (Peepers: ""Have a good weekend!"" Lorne: ""Oh, yes, we will, we will ... we're having artichokes!"")

And even in this first season, we get to watch the budding romance between Peepers and the school nurse. Patricia Benoit's Miss Remington, with her early-Mia-Farrow short haircut and a fetching bit of an overbite, comes off as a quietly sexy small-town girl, and her eternal solicitous gaze at Peepers seems utterly plausible and warms the heart.

The show takes its time, with long, casual exchanges between the characters that no wacky Desilu show ever had time for. As with most shows, it took a little while to gel. The first disk and a bit dwell in a little too much dopey slapstick, and only after them are Randall and Benoit introduced (despite the frequently adduced factoid, Walter Matthau plays the coach only in the pilot, which is included in the set). But by the end of the second disk, you're hooked and happy to return ""next week"" as Cox reminds us to at the end of every show. I can't wait for the second season to come out (it'd better!).

As to quality, I am mystified at some of the reviewers' complaints. As kinescopes (film made of a TV monitor, so that live shows could be rebroadcast out west), these are quite nice compared to what some of them look like after all this time. MR. PEEPERS never looked like FATHER KNOWS BEST because it was either seen done live on flickering little sets or as kinescopes. Sound in the first half-dozen or so episodes is a little dicey, especially since Cox was soft-spoken, but turning up the volume does the trick.

And as for performance glitches, it is admirable how few there are. If you're really waiting for them, you sense that here and there someone has dropped a line and the others are filling in. But it's not as if people are tripping over furniture, or going blank as to what to say next and breaking each other up a la blooper reels. If anything, the live aspect is exciting -- when a scene is over, often the camera will focus on some trivial set piece or Marion Lorne will be given 30 seconds of ""business,"" just so that everyone can run over to the next set and launch into a scene taking place the next day (often in different clothes!). It's like watching little plays.

Most fifties TV is tough viewing today -- just try sitting through more than one episode of PRIVATE SECRETARY, for example; America and its sense of humor have changed vastly since the Eisenhower era. MR. PEEPERS was one for the ages, and given that I used to think it was all but lost, hooray for the UCLA archive (and the show's creators, for donating the kinescopes). Very soon, let's have Season Two -- with disks properly pressed and packaged.",1151712000,34,4007,4.572423398328691

Second - If you have a problem with the quality, please understand- this is primitive technology. Google ""kinescope"" and see how it was done.

The show: WONDERFUL.

I'd heard about Mr. Peepers, saw one beat-up 16mm print years ago and loved it.
Content - it's genuinely funny. Gentle, loving, warm, subtle.

Wally Cox - Magnificent.
Marion Lorne - Hey - who DOESN'T love Aunt Clara?

Production: Smooooooth. It's fun to watch ""live"" TV that happened EVERY week. Sure - there are some sound and lighting glitches, but imagine what it must have been like trying to do a show like that. HUGE cameras that needed LOTS of light, cramped sets full of extras, and a cast and crew that had less than a week to rehearse and block. Then....ONE chance to get it right. And all in front of a studio audience that you HOPED would get the jokes.

Lucy was FILMED with 3 cameras, then edited and sweetened.
Hey, I LOVE Lucy but Peepers went for non-slapstick and believable storylines and characters.
Mr. Peepers DEFINES ""The Golden Age Of Television"".
Thank you UCLA archivists for making this milestone show available.
Mr. Peepers was way ahead of it's time.
No.
Wait.
Mr. Peepers was in a class by itself.",1146009600,19,1228,4.693023255813953
2429512,4,B000BNMX0G,"I love these shows. Character-driven low-key comedy, totally unlike the slapstick of I Love Lucy, I Married Joan, My Little Margie, and so on. Live TV like this can be rough, almost amateurish at times, but the cumulative effect of these shows is of one of charm and sincerity. I played an episode for my wife and my mom recently. When it finished, I started to put the disk away, but they stopped me and asked to see another.

Sadly, be prepared to test all of these disks carefully as soon as you get them. My first set came with a loose scratched disk. I caught that in time to return it. My second set looked OK but it turned out Disk #2 was a mislabelled Disk #4, so I have two #4's and no #2. I didn't catch that until I was past the return date.

On both sets, I found that neither the extras (the pilot episode and an interview with Dom Deluise) nor the last episode or two on each disk would play on either of my two DVD players. The player would hesitate, jitter and eventually freeze up. They were however watchable on my PC.

Despite these problems, I recommend Mr Peepers to anyone who wants to see a true original classic in TV comedy.",1145664000,12,1149,4.237442922374429
2429513,5,B000BNMX0G,"The sound quality of the FIRST of 4 DVDs is sometimes a little rough, but once you have cranked up your volume to full-blast, you CAN hear it quite well, and this is a series worth hearing.  Mr. Peepers is one of the most charming TV characters of all time, and the series has aged well.  I was impressed with the quality of most of these 4 DVDs, considering they were printed from kinescopes, and delighted with the humor, characterizations and WIT.  Charming altogether.  I only wish that ALL the episodes were available for purchase.  THAT would really be a treasure.  But then, this is already a little treasure.....",1142899200,15,620,4.6422018348623855
2429514,5,B000BNMX0G,"For many years I only had one episode of this cute show, and thought there were no more in existence. I was happy to find this set at a Borders and bought it. I haven't had trouble playing any of the discs, and am really enjoying them. I was born in 1965 so I don't remember this show, but it's so cute and subtle, and I prefer the older shows to later sitcoms where everyone just yaks away with trite and unfunny lines, and every other joke is filthy.

The quality is pretty good, sometimes the sound is too low, but it's in the kinescopes, not the DVD. I hope the rest of this series is released. Mr. Peepers rules!",1140134400,9,617,4.141666666666667

Someone else complained of same problem.  The manufacturer should have better quality control. I will try purchasing at a later date, but I wonder how responsive seller will be. Too bad as I looked forward to seeing this wonderful series once again.",1137715200,16,386,4.676470588235294
8089374,5,B000BNMX0G,"An unusually good show, far ahead of its time in both technical styling and clever writing. The use of superimposed text on a live broadcast, for instance, was brand new as a narrative technique. And the way they're able to milk so many laughs out of extremely simple props or gags is amazing. Wally Cox was also an exceptional character actor. I'd mostly seen him in cameos on shows like Twilight Zone before this, but I looked around and found he had another great show called The Adventures of Hiram Holliday that I wish someone would remake (well) these days.",1485129600,2,563,4.64

Saw Mister Peepers for first time on youtube and found it so delightful and charming that I decided to order on Amazon.
Ironically, Wally Cox stated in an interview once that he disliked Mister Peepers because it was grueling to do live and it type cast him. He said he was grateful that it was not recorded and couldn't be shown again. He obviously didn't realize it was being recorded by kinescope.",1470614400,,584,4.407407407407407

So, only purchase this series if you're prepared to be cheated out of half of Season 2.",1465862400,,379,4.205479452054795

Think of it as a time capsule to the 1950's. Not the same USA anymore. The new technology of streaming video makes it highly unlikely that this will be manufactured when the supply sells out. More and more the use of DVDs is becoming old fashioned. Will Mr. Peepers reappear some day on streaming? Who knows? It is done only if profitable.because TV has never been about art.
