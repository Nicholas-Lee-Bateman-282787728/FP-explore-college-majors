7944353,5,B00005LVQ0,"A very dark noir story based on ""I Married A Dead Man"" by American author Cornell Woolrich, a master of the genre.  Nathalie Baye and Madeleine Robinson are superb actresses and the setting in the French countryside makes the story truly French.  It is a shame that this edition in Region 2 is so overpriced.  Hopefully, one day it will make its way onto Amazon.ca in an all-region edition in the original French language version with subtitles.  Until then, there is an American remake titled
""Mrs. Winterbourne"" starring Ricky Lake, Brendan Fraser, and Shirley MacLaine.  While it is a good telling of the story, it lacks some of the sharp drama of the original.",1268611200,5,664,4.7894736842105265
7944354,5,B00005LVQ0,"I am heartbroken that this movie is not available for purchase.  I have longed to purchase it since I first saw it in the 1980's. An American movie was loosely based on it, called ""While You Were Sleeping,"" with Sandra Bullock, but is was more of a comedy, while ""I Married a Shadow"" is much more serious, more of a film noir. It is a beautiful film about a young lady in the last month of pregnancy who is running away from her abusive boyfriend by train.  She is befriended on the train by a lovely and friendly woman who is also in her 9th month of pregnancy.  This woman is on her way to the Provence region of France with her new husband, the father of her baby.  She is French but met her new husband, also a Frenchman, in the U.S.  She has no family of her own, has never met her new in-laws, and is on her way to their vineyard to meet them. The woman and the younger, abused lady spend hours talking about their hopes and dreams. The young lady also befriends the new husband.  She asks if she can try on the woman's new wedding ring.  As soon as it is on her finger, the train crashes, killing most people on board, including the new husband and wife, and severely injuring the single young lady.  From her engraved wedding ring, and the fact that her injured body is lying next to the newly married young man, and the man's parents have never met or seen their new daughter-in-law, she is quickly identified by the grieving parents as their daughter-in-law, carrying their unborn grandchild.  When the young lady finally awakes from her coma, the entire family is there, embracing her with open arms and telling her they will love her like their own daughter and help her raise their new grandchild.  The young lady tries to tell them about the mix-up, but they assume the accident has caused her memory to lapse and won't hear of her considering any other option but to come home with them.  The young lady's parents died when she was young and she has had a very difficult life.  She is now on the run from an abusive boyfriend who has told her if she ever leaves him he will find her and kill her.  She feels this might be a temporary solution to her problem and embraces her new identity, lets the media believe she was the young pregnant lady killed in the train crash and goes home with the family.  They embrace her with love and acceptance as she's never had before, and adore the little boy they assume is their beloved son's child.  The younger brother of the man killed on the train finds himself, against his better judgment, drawn to her and yet vaguely suspicious of her at the same time--something's not quite right.  Without wanting to give away the story, complications arise which may destroy the young lady's first and only chance at happiness and even worse, may destroy the family she has come to love.  It is a must-see, strange and haunting.  You will not forget it.",1203465600,11,2900,4.409005628517824
