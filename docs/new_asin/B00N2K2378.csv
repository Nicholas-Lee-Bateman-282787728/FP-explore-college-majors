honest and spiritual quest for the Question
"" Why climb K2 ? ""

breathtakingly dangerous heights!. Superbly done !!",1417392000,,191,5.366666666666666
6608077,5,B00N2K2378,"Know that this is a documentary, know that it's low budget, and know that it's about mountain climbing and adventure.  With that in context, 5 stars.",1417392000,2,149,4.730769230769231
6608078,5,B00N2K2378,"I recently had the opportunity to see this film and a couple other mountain movies at an International Film Festival and this one gets my vote as the one to see.  This film puts you in the role as one of the team climbers.  The videography is stunning -- especially when you consider the task of packing heavy cameras, extra batteries, and such, up the mountain (and sometimes hiking backwards) just to get authentic footage.  The lead characters are compelling with their reasoning and they suck you into justifying this near death experience.  The ""100 year old anniversary"" story gives the film a subject matter, but it's really the majestic killer K2 and this modern expedition team that makes the movie great.  Everyone talked about this film in the lobby after it's Premiere showing.  Great! Great! Great!  This film reaches the 5 Star Summit!!!",1411862400,11,851,4.868055555555555
6608079,5,B00N2K2378,"A great movie about K2 which contrasts the 2009 climb with the Duke of Abruzzi's attempt in 1909.  Thwre's beautiful footage from camps 1-4 as well as the route itself.  I've already watched it 4 times, as it never gets boring.  Absolutely mesmerizing...",1427932800,,254,4.8604651162790695
6608080,4,B00N2K2378,"Dislike the packaging. The DVD was sent in an extremely slim paper sleeve (not the standard plastic DVD case). Edges of sleeve were bent in the mail. However, the disk was fine. Good movie--terrible/cheap packaging.",1427587200,2,215,5.171428571428572
6608081,3,B00N2K2378,"I honestly think that""some"" of these reviews are from people connected to the film. It's good, but it's not as great as some of these reviewers are suggesting. It comes in a piece of cardboard (so the image is a tad deceiving) which isn't a problem, but it's very much an indie undertaking. The picture is great but there isn't much drama in the story line and it is kind of short at 75 minutes. I'm NOT saying it's bad, but it didn't live up to the hype of the initial reviews on here. Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations?",1427328000,4,526,4.3232323232323235
6608082,4,B00N2K2378,"Amazing hi-def footage ! The process of getting to K2 looks like an expedition in itself. A lot of formalities and logistics, that many would never consider. It's a bit of history lesson on one of the first real expeditions to the Karakoram mountains and K2, while telling the story of four climbers and their adventures to and on the mountain of mountains. One climber, a guide named Fabrizio, has been at least 8 times. And yet even his expertise and experience has yet to see him stand on the top.
The movie takes you on the lengthy 8 day trek across the Baltoro glacier. To Concordia and the first views of K2. Base camp, the Cesen Route, the Shoulder, and the Bottleneck are all thoroughly documented with razor sharp detail. A must have for mountain climbing enthusiasts who long to make the journey to the worlds second highest peak. Even the B&W photos by Vittorio Sella are on display with amazing crispness.",1423267200,5,917,4.631901840490798
6608083,1,B00N2K2378,"Tediously slow. If you're suffering from insomnia, this will cure it in a jiffy. Way too much talking, then more talking, then even more. There is no real forward structure to this film, either. It inches toward the climbing, but continually rambles off into some very long periods of ...you guessed it...more talking. I've watched a number of climbing, mountain-expedition documentaries over the years (including several on K2). Many were very well done. This is NOT one of them.",1422576000,3,480,5.0886075949367084
6608084,5,B00N2K2378,"I watched this online, and then borrowed it from the library. I've been watching a lot of videos about climbing in the Himalaya, mostly about Everest. I found this video very refreshing - it doesn't have a conflict angle, meaning that we don't see selfishness, rash decisions, big egos, etc. These climbers are on K2 because they love climbing and love the mountain. They're not looking to ""conquer"" anything - it's more like they're communing with the mountain, with nature. The climbers are fun to watch, and the scenery is incredible. This is one of the only climbing movies I've seen that gave me the sense of how big the mountain is, and how miniscule the climbers are in comparison. The diary entries and photos from the 1909 expedition were also interesting, though I was more interested in the current expedition. The DVD has extras too, which I haven't watched yet. I will definitely be getting this DVD!",1421539200,13,913,4.784810126582278

8675826,5,B00N2K2378,"I was on Fabrizio's first expedition to K2 in 2000, and it was nice seeing his pictures higher on the mountain than I got (just above House's chimney.  He certainly deserved to get to the top but had to rescue a Pakistani who was abandoned by a Korean expedition.  No comment on Koreans, since another Korean group was full of wonderful people.  K2 is the most wonderful mountain I have been on, and is amazing to see from base camp.  I recommend any DVD showing real footage of the mountain.",1521849600,,492,4.433333333333334
8675827,5,B00N2K2378,"A great film.

8675832,5,B00N2K2378,"This is not a grand adventure film like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertical-Limit-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertical Limit (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2000) with explosions, stunts, and computer graphics.  Nor is it a drama like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/K2-The-Ultimate-High/dp/B00005MM67/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">K2: The Ultimate High</a>&nbsp;(1991), nor an inquiry into a climbing disaster like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Summit/dp/B00FYV7WD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Summit</a>&nbsp;(2012).  Instead, it is a documentary about a 2009 expedition to K2.  Produced by First Run Features, a small company specializing in documentaries about a wide range of subjects, K2: Siren of the Himalayas was actually filmed on location, and the events it records were real.

K2 is the second highest peak in the world.  Although roughly 800 feet shorter than Mt. Everest, it is considerably more dangerous.  The 2009 expedition included about a half dozen climbers, but K2 focuses on expedition leader Fabrizio Zangrilli, Austrian Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner (who would become the first woman to climb all 14 of the worlds 8,000+meter peaks without supplemental oxygen), and Jake Meyer, a British climber (said to be the youngest person to climb the highest peak on every continent) who had climbed Mt. Everest and came to K2 seeking something that was much more of a challenge.  The perspectives of these climbers are supplemented by insights from Chris Szymiec, who is leading an expedition to Broad Peak, which is on the opposite side of the Baltoro Glacier from K2.

Whereas the budget for Vertical Limit has been estimated at $75,000,000, that for K2: Siren of the Himalayas was only a little over $200,000.  This may explain why, although she is fluent in English, the film incorporates some footage of Kaltenbrunner speaking in German (with English subtitles).  This was probably originally filmed for one of several Austrian television shows about her.  Its small budget may also explain why this film was shot with small hand held cameras, including a high definition camcorder.  In some ways, this is an advantage, because these cameras provide close-ups of climbers into foul weather and on the most precipitous slopes.  And, by zooming in on the mountainside, the cameras pick out climbers as tiny figures, invisible to the naked eye, showing how immense K2 really is.

K2: Siren of the Himalayas takes us on the journey from Islamabad to K2 over some very primitive roads, one of which is partially blocked by a rock slide.  There are an explanation of acclimatization strategy, and descriptions of previous climbs and alternative climbing routes.  The great strength of this film is its coverage of the climbers on the mountain, as they make their way up the Cesen (Basque Spur) through wind-blown snow and around an avalanche, and up the infamous Bottleneck, and spend their nights in extremely precarious camp sites.  There are also impressive panoramic shots of the neighboring peaks.  K2 includes maps, and tags superimposed on the screen to identify individual mountains, camp sites, climbing routes, and climbers.

K2 includes about 20 brief segments of still and motion pictures taken by photographer Vittorio Sella during the Duke of the Abruzzis 1909 K2 expedition.  The still pictures are mostly sharp and dramatic, but, not surprisingly, the motion pictures suffer from poor resolution.  Accompanying these images are portions of Filippo de Filippis report on the 1909 expedition, read by actor Simone Leorin.  One might have preferred to have all the 1909 material in one place, but it has been distributed through the film so viewers can compare the experiences of the 1909 and 2009 expeditions in comparable stages in their work.

Extras include  (1) Rescue in the Karakoram (13 minutes) uses footage shot after the K2 expedition of the successful rescue of an expedition cook suffering from high altitude cerebral edema, and the unsuccessful attempt to rescue a Spanish climber stranded on Latok II (7,108 meters) after an accident.  (2) Death on Broad Peak (5 minutes) describes the death of an Italian climber who fell from a mountain next to K2.  (3) Gerlinde on Her 2011 Summit of K2 (9 minutes) consists almost entirely of Kaltenbrunners description of how she reached the top of K2 in 2011, despite a storm and heavy accumulation of snow.  This climb was much more complicated and difficult than the brief segment in K2 implies.  Curiously, Kaltenbrunner continued her climb on this occasion, although her husband considered conditions too dangerous and turned back.  (4) Gerlinde on Dhaulagiri (3 minutes) presents Kaltenbrunners comments on her climb on Dhaulagiri, but no film footage.  (5) Bonus Clips (7 minutes) include outtakes of material omitted from the main feature.

If you want to see what it is like to climb in the Himalayas, you should watch this film.",1446595200,7,5077,5.649538866930171
8675833,5,B00N2K2378,"For pure, astounding portraiture of how incredibly massive, monolithic, dangerous, remote and beautiful these mountains are, this is a great film. It is not an adrenaline rush type of thing, but rather a methodical and carefully-considered look at K2 and the journey involved in attempting its ascent. Much like the expedition itself in that regard, I would think. The juxtaposition of the modern expedition with the earlier one provides a nice historical context, and the interviews with the modern climbers are good. But the breathtaking thing about this film is just being able to see this incredible part of the world, be impressed by how difficult it is to even mount an expedition to the base camp, and then just see the images. Absolutely gorgeous and haunting at the same time. Highly recommended. If you are allured by high mountains, this is a must-see.",1430524800,,863,5.0
8675834,5,B00N2K2378,"K2, Siren of the Himalaya is one of the more important documentaries about climbing in the Himalayas. What we usually see and hear about are the hundreds of climbers who go to Mt Everest. K2 is the most difficult of climbs, and at the time this documentary was shot in 2011, only 302 climbers made it to the summit.

The film shows us group of climbers in 2009 climbing the worlds second highest mountain, alternating this footage with early films and journal excerpts from a 1909 expedition. This teams leader, Fabrizio Zangrilli, an American, discusses the risks, and tells us 25 percent of those who attempt the summit die.
One of Fabrizio's comments made me shudder a little, As soon as you eliminate the danger, you have just another sport"". some in his group climb without oxygen, which to me does not make sense. They talk about their heart pounding so hard in their chest, and this is the thrill Fabrizio's is after. Their hearts are trying to pump harder to provide enough oxygen to their brain and base organs.

The ride to K2 is very dangerous. They go from Islamabad to small towns over narrow roads fit for one car, and on the side are steep ravines tumbling to nothing. One mistake and off you go. We go with themqq from base camp to camp one, rest for a few days and then to camp two for a day, back down to camp one to acclimate, then up to camp two, and onto camp three. K2 is known for its severe weather and slopes, and we see for ourselves. Several days of severe storms and a couple of avalanches. Finally to camp four, situated on a ledge, as most of the camps are, and then a try for the summit.

One of the most interesting of climbers is Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, from Austria. We are told by 2013 she has become one of two women to climb all fourteen of the eight hundred meter mountains. She climbed Everest in 2012 and was successful. Another climber, Jake Meyer, from Britain, says that he was looking for something demanding after conquering Everest. He was unable to complete a try for the summit, he could feel his heart and lungs really struggling, and he gave up the climb. These are not foolish climbers, they make rational decisions.

The documentarys climbing footage is spectacular. Most of it is shot by the director, Dave Ohlson. Really, some of the best climbing filming I have seen. The photography in general is superb, giving us Pakistan in a different light. I will following Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner  to see her exploits as the years pass.
