8452746,5,B0051HAU48,"Nothing like seeing what the good doctor is up to these days. It's a shame his career didn't go any further. I've always wondered, if Stone Cold Steve Austin, didn't take some of Dr. D's mannerisms and gimmick into his own personna during the Attitude Era. No, that's not a knock on Austin, it's perfectly natural for one to take traits from people that have come before us in whatever walk of life our trade is in. Dr. D was in many ways ahead of his time. Tragic that Vince did what he did to him. I don't think there's a wrestling fan who was around and watching back in late 1984, who didn't feel liberated when he smacked Stossel around. Nothing against John Stossel, but the insinuation of pro wrestling being fake make me sick. To anyone who says that ever, I always refrain, try walking a mile in any professional wrestler's shoes. You try to keep their schedule. You try to perform night after night, week after week, month after month, and in cases like John Cena's year after year, while living with injuries and pain that would be any lay person in a hospital or out of commission for weeks to months on end. Dr. D. holds no punches, and tells it like it is. I only wish he'd try making  a comeback. Not likely though. He's probably have a hard time fitting in with today's juvenile gimmicks and storylines. All in all, I would recommend this dvd to any wrestling afficionando who appreciates the classics.",1383609600,,1418,4.474903474903475
