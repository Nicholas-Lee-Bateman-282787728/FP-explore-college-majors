All in all a good video to RENT, if it's available.  Else, ask for it as a gift, like I did.  ;-)",1009584000,3,268,3.7142857142857144
7897765,1,6305908850,"This was the absolute worst ""tribute"" show I have ever seen, Trek or non-Trek.  Jason Alexander, et al, who were supposed to be giving this tribute gave the worst impressions of Kirk, Spock and Bones.  They  were really bad.  The so-called clips were 5 seconds for the longest, and  just zipped by so fast you could hardly see them, much less tell what  episode or movie they came from.
I am just glad that if I had to sit  through this I did when it was on TV so that I didn't have to pay anything  extra for it.  They should pay you to take it off their hands.",963964800,4,562,4.08256880733945
7897766,1,6305908850,"The best part about this show is the opening MTV style Techno Trek theme and flashfire clips.  Jason Alexander is inane and fills the time between the trek clip with a humorless and lame attempt to emulate the William  Shatner school of overacting.  Catch a rerun of any trek episode before you  buy this dog.... When it ran on UPN, I immediately put the tape I'd  recorded it on back onto the blank pile.  and I like a bit of Doctor who,  so for me to say this is bad is saying something...",963964800,,491,4.21505376344086
7897767,1,6305908850,"What bills itself as ""Star Trek's Greatest Momements"" (which, at 43 minutes wouldn't seem to do the subject justice) turns out to be about 15 minutes of Star Trek, in snippets no longer than about 20 seconds each,  and 28 minutes of filler, mostly Jason Alexander and two others, dressed as  Kirk, Spock and Bones, all engaged in some inane excuse of a plot.
I  should have known from the 43 minute running time, but it looks like this  was originally made as a 1-hour television special.  It is being released  on video probably because even the television execs, with their ultra-low  standards, realized that Ultimate Trek was nothing of the sort.
You would  be much better off buying *any* star trek episode or movie than watching  this tape.",960595200,20,746,4.72093023255814
