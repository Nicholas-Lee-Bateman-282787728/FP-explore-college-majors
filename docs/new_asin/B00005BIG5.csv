1424085,5,B00005BIG5,"I really love this video.  It provides a great cardio workout and excellent toning exercises.  Minna combines exercises, so you get the ultimate workout. I am out of shape, but I do my best to keep up with the moves, and walk in place when it goes beyond my limits.",999561600,,265,4.28
1424086,5,B00005BIG5,"I recently purchased this video, because I have her Strength & Grace and Fat Eliminator.  I did it for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it.  It's not very difficult, but is perfect for the days I want some cardio and light toning (not a 'killer' workout).  I usually use heavier weights, and probably will the next time, but I did feel that I got in a satisfactory workout.  The ab section was very weak, I would have liked something longer and more intense, but all-in-all, I found it a fun video and the time flew by.  Minna is a very good instructor, easy to follow and not at all what I had expected (cheerleader type).",994291200,15,634,4.384615384615385
1424087,4,B00005BIG5,"This consists of two half hour workouts.  The first is a hi/lo that is a bit dancy, but not too complex.  She is very good at teaching the steps, but it does require a certain amount of co-ordination- they are not all easy to do.  The music is motivating, and she includes lots of shimmying your shoulders while moving your legs in another pattern.  It is fun, and the time flies by.  The toning section is the second half, and is well planned.  It is fun to do- but I like weight work. Some of the moves are complex- you are exercising more than one body part at a time.  This is a good workout for someone to start with as you can do the two halves separately, and work up to a full hour workout.  The intensity is lower than Tae Bo, and is mostly low impact.
Minna is a great teacher, and very personable.  She doesn't come off as a bimbo, but instead is very competent and motivating.  She looks great.  She has one white, and one black background exerciser, which I thought was great, as there aren't a lot African Americans in exercise videos.",992390400,18,1049,4.274111675126903
1424088,5,B00005BIG5,"Love it,one of the best I've used and great results.",1435536000,,52,4.3
1424089,5,B00005BIG5,"I have had lots of workout DVDs, and this one is one of my absolute favorites that I do over and over. It is divided into two 30-minute sections, one for cardio that mixes some classic athletic segments with some latin dancing-inspired segments, and second section for full-body toning and strength. It is great for beginner to intermediate exercisers. I love the way this workout is designed, Minna has a great personality (not too perky or too relaxed), cues well, and changes things up so you do not get bored during the workout.",1430524800,3,532,4.731182795698925
1424090,5,B00005BIG5,Love Minna! Been doing her workout for about 17 or 18 years now.. Have worn out a video.. So this time I purchased a DVD!,1425772800,,121,3.88
1424091,5,B00005BIG5,"I have had this video since I had my first baby and that was 12 years ago. Back then in my early twenties this dvd really helped me shed the baby weight. Now in my early 30s I popped  this dvd back in and Im in love with it all over again. Seriously I never write reviews, but this dvd deserves one. Minna cues very well, and just balances all the workouts so well. There is a 30 min cardio and a 30 min toning workout. I wake up the next day and my butt and thighs are on fire, so I know we are targeting those zones well both in both workouts. Highly recommend Minna, even over 10 years old this dvd still has it! Im actually on here today to order some more of her dvds.",1422057600,6,673,3.8768115942028984
1424092,3,B00005BIG5,"The cover indicated that a booklet and diet planner would be inside. It was not there, just the DVD. I bought this item to replace my old VHS of the same workout. I do enjoy it.",1408838400,,177,3.9444444444444446
1424093,5,B00005BIG5,"I had this workout years ago as a vhs and needed it in DVD, ordered it on Amazon.com.  The workouts are great!  One is a dance/aerobic cardio, the other is strength training.  With all the workout videos out there, this one still takes the cake!",1400198400,,245,4.4
1424094,5,B00005BIG5,"I love this DVD; I used to have the VCR version! I like to mix things up; and this has not been given away and is still in my collection after 10+ years. Minna is fun!; great workout, it is dancy; so if you're not into that at all; you wouldn't like it. 30 minutes cardio; 30 min strength, or both. Still refreshing!!",1388361600,,317,4.0476190476190474
1424095,5,B00005BIG5,"My VHS version finally wore out, I ordered the DVD.  This is a perfect balance of cardio and toning! Highly recommended.",1371513600,,120,4.714285714285714
1424096,1,B00005BIG5,"this is the second time i ordered this dvd - and the second time the video stopped halfway through the workout frozen so I could not complete the work out.  I had done this workout previously and loved it, but I broke the dvd I had and wanted to replace it.  This was one of my go to cardio workouts!  I am so super irritated.  Also, it does not come with the diet info as advertised on the cover.  This is obviously a scam reproduction.  Don't buy from amazon.",1363651200,,461,4.123595505617978
1424097,5,B00005BIG5,"This DVD is great! I originally borrowed it from the Library and found it to be so effective that the next day I was searching for it on the internet! It keeps you motivated and even though it's not a current taping, it's so good that you don't care.",1259020800,,250,4.122448979591836
1424098,5,B00005BIG5,"Minna proves again that she knows how to put together a great workout! It's really nice because it combines cardio and fitness exercises that you can alternate through the week. The cardio dance moves take a little learning and practice, but definatly burns calories. There's also extra info on the dvd about nutrition, etc.
And it arrived quickly in the mail!",1246406400,,360,4.918032786885246
1424099,5,B00005BIG5,"This dvd is great for beginners.  She goes at an easy-to-follow pace.  Once you get the hang of the routine you can make it more difficult for yourself because you're no longer concentrating on getting the moves down, so you can concentrate more on tightening your abs and putting more bounce into your steps that you get a better workout.

In each section of the workout, she breaks it up so that you learn a few steps at a time, and then puts it altogether.

Even better, Minna is not OVERLY GIDDY that you want to kick your tv.",1239580800,,530,4.3232323232323235
1424100,5,B00005BIG5,I really like this video because it's a great workout without being overwhelming.  Minna makes the excercise fun by mixing in the Latin dance moves.  She's not too cheesey or over-the-top like some instructors.  The aerobic portion mixed with the toning and stretching portions makes this a really well-rounded routine.,1227571200,2,319,5.34
1424101,5,B00005BIG5,"I absolutely LOVE this video!!  I have used it for years now and it's by far the one I use the most.  It consists of two 30 minute segments (cardio, then toning).  I don't typically do the first 30 minute segment because I'm more interested in toning than in cardio, so I usually just do the second 30 minute segment.  The exercises are very effective and, unlike some other videos I've tried, they are basic enough so that most people can do them without a problem.  I've tried some videos where the exercises are just so complicated or challenging I can't do all of them.  And of course if you aren't doing the exercises they're not going to be very effective!  The toning exercises on this workout are very basic, but also very effective.  I definitely notice a difference when I do the workout consistently.  She also makes use of more than one muscle group at a time, which increases the effectiveness and helps burn more calories.  I also like the fact that she alternates which muscles she's using.  When the same muscles are worked over and over in a row I find it hard to finish all the exercises because the muscle gets so tired. But she will work a muscle group, go on to something else, and then come back to it again once it's had a little rest.  I like Minna a lot.  She is encouraging and not at all annoying.  And I like the fact that each segment is only 30 minutes.  It's definitely enough time to make a difference, but not so much that it makes it impractical to do.  I get a nice sense of accomplishment by finishing videos rather than stopping halfway through because they're just too long.  My friend also uses some of the Minna videos and loves them.  Very highly recommended!",1227312000,,1700,4.429032258064516
1424102,5,B00005BIG5,You really enjoy working out with Minna; she is really contagious and full of life..a DVD to have!,1214784000,,98,4.5
1424103,4,B00005BIG5,"Buy this DVD for the toning workout.  The cardio portion is okay, but you will need to do it on a bare floor, since there is a lot of pivoting and turning around with all the dancing, which is not difficult, but unsafe to do on carpet. Lessig is very good about cueing and reminding you of proper form.
The toning workout is one you can use for a while, starting with lower weights and increasing as you go.  Plenty of variety in the exercises to keep you from getting bored, but long enough to feel like you're getting some kind of a workout.",1192147200,,543,4.211538461538462
1424104,4,B00005BIG5,"I will start by saying I LOVE Minna Lessig!  She is a GREAT instructor - just enough ""cheerleader"" and motivating instruction without being annoying and flitty like Denise Austin.  Plus, just looking at Minna makes you want to workout as hard as you can - she's a great example of strength being very feminine and attainable.
Okay, on to the workout....it is so much FUN! especially if you like to dance!  I don't know about it being intense (or long) enough to get you looking like Minna ;), but it is one I reach for over and over to break up the monotony of my other cardio and fitness tapes (and I have dozens!!) and to get a quick mood lift.  The other portion is a nice strengthening segment, but I find myself using more intense ones I have more.
The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because I do wish it were just a little harder and have the ability to add on a bonus 10 or 15 minutes if you wanna keep going (one reason I am loving the 10 minute solution series so much!)....
DO try Minna's ""Fat Eliminator"" and ""Strength and Grace"" (on one disc when bought in DVD format) - two incredibly good intense workout that compliment each other perfectly.  THEY ARE SO GOOD!!",1187913600,,1182,4.306306306306307
1424105,2,B00005BIG5,"I bought the VHS tape of this one back in 2003 right at my 2nd pregnancy. I decided to try it after the baby. We'll I did and it's probably good for losing baby weight. However, if you are an avid workout individual, I would not suggest wasting your money. It took awhile getting used to the choregraphy (felt like I was in a video). The producers could have done better.",1184544000,,371,4.23943661971831
1424106,5,B00005BIG5,"I bought this DVD when I was trying to lose my baby weight.  It was a great way for me to ease back into exercise after having my baby and it's fun.  I think it is great for all levels and I love Minna.  She is not annoying, but she manages to keep you motivated.  This is a must have.",1179273600,2,285,3.7
1424107,5,B00005BIG5,I love this workout. It makes me sweat every time. You can also adjust your sweat level by amping up the moves or toning them down to a more dance style. Minna is easy to follow and she has a fun personality. I do this workout at least three times a week. There are 2 workouts on here and both are equally chanllenging. Do both in one session if you really want to sweat. This is currently my favorite along with my belly dance workouts. I highly recommend this dvd to anybody.,1162339200,2,477,4.195652173913044
1424108,4,B00005BIG5,"I'm in average shape and frequently exercise at home. I used Minna's Fat Eliminator workout for a while and enjoyed her style, so I decided to give the ""Emergency"" workout a shot. I just got it this week and have done the entire video twice. The 30-minute toning portion is great. She combines arms and legs so you do work up a sweat. She's very thorough, covering all of the arm muscles and fatiguing the legs as well. I wish she spent a little more time on the abs, but that's my only complaint. The 30-minute cardio routine is fun, but it will take a few times to get the moves down, including mambos, cha chas, hip shakes, and other salsa-type moves. It requires some concentration which is fine with me, because it makes the workout go quicker. I haven't sweated as much as I do in the Fat Eliminator workout, but I attest that to the fact that I'm still getting used to the moves. Once I become more familiar with the routine, I'm hoping to increase my own intensity and work up a better sweat. Overall, this is a fun cardio and toning program. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a ""dancey"" workout.",1159315200,5,1118,4.3798076923076925
1424109,5,B00005BIG5,"I really like this DVD.  Minna doesn't break any new ground here, but she is a great instructor.  She is not annoying, she cues well, and she's gorgeous so it just might give you something to aspire to.  The cardio portion of this DVD is a lot of fun because, even though it's pretty standard aerobics, Minna puts it together in a way that is NOT AT ALL difficult to follow and kind of makes you feel like you're grooving on a dance floor.  The toning section is heavy on the squats and lunges and you use light weights throughout for the arms.  Absolute beginners might start out with no weights and anyone with weak knees needs to be careful here.  Minna is very fit and goes DEEP into those squats and lunges, but if you are out of shape that will hurt you, so don't go as deep.  I'm sure this DVD won't do much for the advanced exerciser, but for everyone else I think it's just wonderful.  You can increase the weights in the toning section as you progress and it's easy to step up the cardio a bit if you focus and USE all of your muscles to get that heart rate up.  A lot of people complain about the quality of the cardio and at first I agreed, but once I got the routine down and really focused on the workout...I got sweaty!  I'm glad I bought this (it's going into my favorites pile) and I would definitely recommend buying the Emergency Workout.  It really is a fun video and Minna is lovely and low-key.",1151971200,8,1416,4.226765799256506
1424110,5,B00005BIG5,"This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation.

I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights.

Minna is a great instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD and I love that one.",1148688000,4,1144,3.9695652173913043
1424111,5,B00005BIG5,"This DVD is a good balance of cardio and strength training.  The cardio portion is upbeat with fun dance moves.  Minna does a good job of explaining the moves and it's easy to follow.  The strength portion is challenging using small hand weights and targets lots of areas, mostly arms and legs.  Good overall workout.",1140998400,3,317,4.709090909090909
1424112,4,B00005BIG5,"I used the tape about 4 days a week and I really saw a difference in my body, especially my arms.  I only did the toning portion.  I felt silly doing the dance portion and I really don't care for the music.  Other than that, I recommend this video for toning. I have also tried ""Optimizer"" and ""Strength and Grace"" which are also very good and there is no dancing.",1137801600,4,364,4.171428571428572
1424113,1,B00005BIG5,"I bought this video as something to throw in with my regular routine so I wouldn't get stuck in a plateau from not enough variation.  Unfortunately, the routines were confusing and difficult to follow.  It also consisted of a lot of standing in one place and shimmying your body as opposed to really getting a workout by moving.  I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the other great reviews.  10 minutes into the workout I turned it off because my heart rate wasn't what I wanted for a cardio workout.  I would not suggest this as a good workout even for a beginner.",1137456000,3,583,4.5673076923076925
1424114,5,B00005BIG5,"You cannot go wrong with Minna.  She's terrific.  The aerobics section is wonderful and the editorial review is right on the money about the aerobics - it's dance but nothing you can't do.  Yet you will feel like you are a champion dancer with her excellent cuing and her easy to follow break-down of the routine.  I like the way she combo's the tone section but I can say you have to work on balance too.  And for me that is hard - grace is not my strongest asset.  But don't let that talk you into skipping this video.  It's worth it, especially if you are just starting out.  You'll notice a difference as the weeks go on and you will have a deep sense of achievement as well as a fit body!",1137369600,3,693,4.157894736842105
1424115,5,B00005BIG5,"I bought this tape when it first came out and I weighed 205 pounds.  I used it 3-4 times a week for about 5-6 months and I lost 70 pounds.  I loved it, it was fun and obviously worked.",1133222400,2,184,3.6923076923076925
1424116,2,B00005BIG5,"I was hoping for an exercize routine I could really use, but this is so dancy and complicated that it's tough to follow. I enjoy aerobics in general, but there are so many ""shoulder shimmies"" and ""hip circles"" in this video, it makes me wonder if it was created for entertainment purposes rather than to give us a workout. If you need a good workout that you can realistically follow, consider something else.",1116028800,7,409,4.616438356164384
1424117,4,B00005BIG5,"Many people have already done a great job of reviewing exactly what this tape offers, so instead, I'll give you my personal take, for what it is worth.

I decided to join the home workout sect, after realizing that my gym membership no longer worked into my finances or schedule.  I am 31, and in decent shape, but I needed to get into a regular workout routine again.  This is the first fitness DVD purchase that I made, and I could not be happier.

Minna is a great instructor; she is motivating without being over the top, and she cues very well, even for a novice like me.  All of the moves on the tape were totally doable my first time through, although I anticipate that in the upcomming sessions I will become more fluid in my movements.  I was definitely sweating after completing the tape, but I didn't feel overwhelmed or overly exhausted.  I look forward to completing this workout 3x a week, and I will write a follow-up to this review in 6 weeks, to see if the tape can live up to its promise.",1110326400,6,1006,4.347593582887701
1424118,5,B00005BIG5,"This video is between easy and somewhat moderate activity level. I noticed a change in the shape of my body after a week-- three times a week works well, and they split it up into one half hour for cardio and one half hour for toning. I reccomend it!",1109030400,3,250,4.122448979591836
1424119,4,B00005BIG5,"I didn't like the music in the cardio part and i think the music is very important in a cardio workout video plus i found the moves were very hard to follow. But i loved the toning part,one of the more complete workout using weights. Faboulous.",1107907200,2,244,4.326086956521739
1424120,4,B00005BIG5,"I must say that I just love Minna's videos. This particular one has a cardio segment that is about 25 minutes long followed by a 30 minute sculpting session. The nice thing about the cardio is that it's not important if you are doing the moves with exact precision, so long as you are moving. You will break a sweat but not wind yourself so much that you can't keep up. I just pretend that we are out dancing together at a party and alter the moves as I feel comfortable. Gets your heart rate up just enough without overdoing it. The sculpting segment can be challenging if you are not used to lunges. I really like it because she combines two power moves together using light weights, and for me, it works as an additional cardio workout because I'm working hard. Typical of Minna's style, just when you think it's going to really start to kill, you have just two more reps and on to the next move. Great overall workout. I think of it as a 55 minute cardio workout with some power moves built in, because my heart rate stays up through the whole thing. I really enjoy Minna's style. The fact that she's a fitness champion is inspiring, and her personality is enthusiastic without being annoying at all. What's more is she just moved to my town and is doing personal training in the area. I can't wait to meet her. I suggest getting her Strength & Grace video too. I feel that's her best one of all, and I can do that one no matter whether I'm tired or not.",1095465600,3,1458,4.305454545454546
1424121,5,B00005BIG5,"This is the best cardio DVD I have ever tried, it is fun and really gets you sweating.

1424122,5,B00005BIG5,"I had doubts about Minna Lessing, since I have ""instructors"" I am comfortable with. My doubts were eliminated the first time around. She explains what you're doing without talking down to you or up to you. There's a wide variety, and the 25 minute aerobics session flies by. The additional half-hour toning involves plenty of fast-paced exercises to keep the heart rate high while you work the muscles. I highly recommend this!",1090454400,2,427,4.944444444444445
1424123,5,B00005BIG5,"I've been exercising at home for years, and this is one of the best workouts I've found.  With 2 small kids and a full-time job, the primary criteria for any workout is that I have to be able to complete it in 30 minutes or less.  This one fits the bill perfectly!
The cardio segment is about 25 minutes, complete with warm-up and cool down.  It's a little dancey but I'm the world's biggest klutz and, after a few tries, I really enjoy it.  The toning segment provides a complete full-body workout in 30 minutes. If you have more time, doing the 2 routines back-to-back works really well, too!",1080777600,5,594,4.422018348623853
1424124,5,B00005BIG5,"Minna's Emergency Workout is aimed at people who have an event they would like to look good for and claims that you will see results in 6 weeks.  This tape can be used by anybody.  The tape is divided into two workouts: a 30 minute cardio workout and a 30 minute toning workout.  The cardio section is great fun.  Minna combines traditional aerobics moves (like grapevines, V-steps, and jumping jacks) with dancier moves (like salsa lunges, mambos, and cha chas).  This helps those of us with two left feet feel like we're dancing while not overwhelming us.  Minna's cuing is excellent and she is upbeat without being overly perky.  Her two assistants look like their having fun, and I definitely have fun and sweat when doing the workout.
The toning workout uses multi-muscle moves to target common problem areas: abs, legs, butt, and arms (for example combing front lateral raises with stationary lunges).  One of Minna's strongest points is that she explains the moves and proper posture.  She also cues very well and prepares you for changes.
Included with the video is a 6 week intensive care diet planner which has a sample workout schedule, fit tips, menus, success tips, and nutrition tips.
Minna's program is very sensible.  It covers cardiovascular fitness, weight training, and good nutrition which are essential for creating a healthier, confident you.  I've only started the program but I feel that it is a program I can stick to and that will help me get the results I want.",1080691200,34,1488,4.841897233201581

I wanted a cardio workout that would be fun and a little different.  There are some salsa moves, mumbas, etc. that are really fun without being too difficult.  Even my husband jumped up and started doing the workout with me and thought it was fun although he did say he was glad the guys at work couldn't see him!
I found the moves pretty easy to follow yet I worked up a good sweat.  It doesn't even matter if you're doing all the moves correctly as long as you're moving and having a good time. I love Minna in the fact that she's cute but not so bubbly she drives you crazy.  I would highly recommend this video.",1079395200,3,763,4.191780821917808

Stay low impact if you have problem knees.  Instructors are good; Minna is the best.  She's funny, professional, and motivating.  First 30 mins is all aerobic.  Dancy moves as well as traditional jumping jacks, marches, and grapevines.  Second 30 mins. is all toning upper body and lower body.  Both traditional and unique exercises and sufficent reps.  Great abs workout, too.  Nothing but accolades for this video.  Please buy it.",1065398400,,603,4.9
1424128,4,B00005BIG5,"I bought this DVD at a super discount store just because the price was right.  I wasn't expecting much but I was surprised that this is a little gem of a DVD.  Having heard the name, Minna, but never seen any of her work I wasn't sure what to expect.  I also am not a fan of gimmicky come on titles such as this one.... you know a ""quick fix"" solution.
What I did like was that it's in two parts, cardio and toning.  I should say I am an experienced exerciser and have been exercising at home exclusively for the last two years.  Prior to that I was a gym junkie and did both cardio and weight lifting on a regular basis.  I use a heart rate monitor to level my performance whenever I work out and I recommend all exercisers who want to really know how they are doing get one as well.  You will be pleasantly surprised at what is really going on.  Don't think because you are feeling tired that you are in the correct heart rate zone or out of it.  You need to see the numbers to really undrestand.  Having said all that I was not able to get my heart rate into my target zone of choice doing the cardio section alone.  I was able to get in the proper zone if this was a second or third cardio segment I was doing but not the first meaning I was already getting fatigued.  Another way I could increase my likelihood of getting into the target zone was to wear the weighted gloves.  I use two pound gloves and had no problem.  As my fitness level improved I found I needed to get something to keep my heart rate in the proper zone and I was not keen on throwing away exercise tapes because I was now in better shape.  My sister on the otherhand is not as experienced as I am and she found that this tape got her heart rate in the target zone right away.  Minna has a good cueing style and her form is excellent.  It doesn't hurt that she looks fantastic so if you like a sculpted look as a an inspiration then she is your girl.
The toning section was ok.  It's effective enough for maintaining but if you want growth then you need to supplement.  Again I thought her form was excellent and that's important especially for people who are just starting out.  I use heavier weights and I recommend that people challenge themselves from time to time.  Just because it looks like the presenter is using a 2 or 3 pound weight in a video doesn't mean that's what you should use.  Try going heavier and go down as fatigue sets in.  You will see better results.  It's my opinion that you see lighter weights on video presenters for two reasons: 1) They need to show correct form at all times and it's easier for them if they aren't really working as hard as they could to maintain that control and 2) they don't want to put off beginners who might feel they can't do the workout using large weights.
Overall a good workout but experienced exercisers may need to modify.",1064016000,46,2859,4.203669724770642
1424129,5,B00005BIG5,"This was the first exercise DVD I ever bought..i really love to dance so i wanted something that would be fun but would work at the same time..and this one did it all!! the cardio work out is soooo much fun , I've done it so mant times that I've memorised the moves by heart! at first, I didn't feel like doing the tonning section because I'm more of a dancy person, but when I decided that I needed the muscles and tried it..it turned out to be great! my arms and thighs are much stronger now=)
As a biggener, i find that the tape really helps,but if you're very athletic, you should probably consider this tape just for the fun of it..
Minna is very sweet and allows you to go crazy and make a fool of yourself which is great...way to go Minna=)",1061337600,,747,4.158620689655172
1424130,4,B00005BIG5,"Another reviewer said this workout is low impact and too easy.
I have to say this is not low impact, there is quite a bit of jumping where both feet are off the floor and that is considered high impact.  If you are a beginner to intermediate exerciser, you will definately break a sweat. Minna is low key, friendly and approachable. The weight segment is very effective. The only problem I have with the video is that Minna's cueing is off sometimes and you really have to learn to memorize the moves because she doesn't always cue when there is a change. For that reason, it would be quite challenging for a very beginner but with time you will pick up the moves. As far as workouts go it is fun and challenging. I like doing both the workouts on the same day.",1055980800,,761,4.321678321678322
1424131,2,B00005BIG5,"If you're intermediate or above, I think you'll find this workout is too easy.  There's nothing wrong with an easy workout - the problem I have is that it's called an EMERGENCY WORKOUT.  This is supposed to be the workout for you if you need to lose weight for a wedding or other occasion.  I really don't think this workout is the most effective way to lose those extra pounds to fit into that special dress.
It's a good balanced beginner workout for those not ready for more complicated moves or a lot of jumping.
Part 1:
The first half is about 25 minutes - not 30 as the tape states (I bought the VHS, not the DVD).  It is low-impact and has a lot of basic salsa moves.  None of the moves are difficult to learn.  It's just a bit basic - I never broke a sweat.  Minna is not very enthusiastic - very dull.
Part 2:
This is the weights/toning section.  It's better than part 1 because you can use the weights you want and customize the workout to your level.  Here's where you can work up a sweat if you challenge yourself with the weights.  This part is closer to the actual 30 minutes that are advertised.
Bonus item:
In the VHS version I bought, a 1200 calorie meal plan was included on a pamphlet.  The information in this pamphlet is FALSE.  I have been counting calories successfully for years and this meal plan is WAY underestimating the number of calories in these foods.  For example, it says you can have a bagel with 2T cream cheese and a piece of fruit for something like 200 calories.  In reality, that's a MINIMUM of 350 calories and could be as much as 500+ calories depending on the type of bagel you choose.  Throw this pamphlet out - it is misleading.
SUMMARY: don't bother with this one if you're intermediate to advanced (that applies to your fitness level as well as your capabilities with various aerobic moves and dance steps).  For your daily 30-60 minutes worth of exercise, you can do something else with a little more ""bang for your buck"".",1050278400,21,1969,4.397790055248619
1424132,5,B00005BIG5,"I love this workout!  The salsa style dance moves of the first thirty minutes help keep me motivated.  The last thirty minutes of toning have provided me with visible results.

1424133,5,B00005BIG5,"I highly recommend this video!!! Minna is so FUN to work out with!! She, and the two girls in the video look so great it's hard NOT to stay motivated. Minna's personality is cheerful, and not annoying.  It feels more like you're working out with your best gal pal than an instructor.  I only use the cardio portion of this tape, because I am committed to Jane Fonda as far as strength training goes. But Minna's aerobic routine is FUN, FRESH, and EFFECTIVE. About 30 minutes long, it's a mix of aerobics and cute dance steps. (lots of mambos, cha chas, and pivot-turns) That approach keeps this workout refreshing, and before you know it, you're to the cooldown. GREAT VIDEO!!",1045008000,2,676,4.625
1424134,3,B00005BIG5,"I was looking forward to buying a new video - one that would give me an extra routine to do so I don't get bored with my current tapes.  But this video was a little disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, Minna is good and she's encouraging and cues really well etc, but this was meant to be a video that you can do when you feel that you won't fit into that special outfit or you wake up one morning and suddenly realise that summer is actually on your doorstep.  This video is not for the advanced exerciser.  It's really for beginners and not that challenging.  It's only low impact and the toning exercises don't fatigue your muscles like you think it should.  Don't buy this if you are used to great challenges like a Keli Roberts tape or Karen Voight etc. because I doubt this will get you into shape at all.",1044835200,4,810,4.261437908496732
1424135,2,B00005BIG5,"I didn't buy this video with the intention of learning the salsa, I got it to excercise!!!  I love Minna's other videos, but this one is too much dancing and not enough of just exercising. I have been doing aerobics for years and I had a hard time with this one!!! They should call it a dance video.",1042848000,3,299,4.155172413793103
1424136,2,B00005BIG5,"The first 30 minutes is a salsa inspired cardio segment that was choreographed so poorly that I was actually embarrassed to see myself do it!  There is way too much hip swinging and general grooving for a rhythm challenged exerciser like myself.  I like my moves a little more athletic, and preferably ones that actually will break me out in a sweat!!
The toning segment, on the other hand, was interesting and a little more challenging.  If you do a different cardio tape, then switch to the toning segment on this one, you would be a lot better off.  It's a good thing I really don't have anything I need to get in shape for in 6 weeks, or using this dvd I would be doomed!",1037836800,3,675,4.333333333333333
1424137,5,B00005BIG5,"Which I am not, so I kind of made up my own moves.  The tape is divided into 2 sections, a dance/cardio routine, and a weight routine.  The dance section consisted of mambos, cha cha's, and a whole lot of dancy type moves.  I can hardly keep both of my feet straight, much less complete a dance routine, so I found myself improving most of the dance routine.  If you are coordinated, you will definately get more of a workout by following the tape exactly, rather than just dancing around like I did.  Minna does not make you feel bad, though, if you are uncoordinated, she does tell you to follow along however you can.  This is termed an 'emergency tape', to get you ready for some big event at least 6 weeks out.  Supposedly if you do this tape 6 days a week for 6 weeks and modify your diet, your body will change.  This obviously isn't true for just this tape, any workout that you stick to for that intensity and length will change your body.  Don't buy this tape thinking it is a miracle, buy it because you want a non-conforming aerobic workout, with a not so tough weights section.",1030665600,4,1090,4.330049261083744
1424138,4,B00005BIG5,"Minna Lessig is a pro. I love her encouraging, yet not obnoxious, style. I also own her Fat Eliminator video, and I hope she comes out with more.  I am among the coordination-challenged, and even *I* mastered the steps after awhile!  So if you are feeling frustrated with this video initially, KEEP IT UP.  You will be glad you did.  This video is challenging, without being too intense.  For intermediate exercisers this may not be challenging enough, but good for a lighter day.  I think this is a good value because you get a complete cardio workout,  plus a handy half-hour toning workout.  One critisism I have is with the cool down.  I felt that I didn't want to do anymore fancy dance moves (especially to Kenny G. type music!), and that it should have included more stretching.  It's pretty useless.  Also, the ab workout at the end is SO SHORT.  What happened to our obliques, Minna?  But these are minor problems that you can remedy by incorporating your own exercises.  I didn't have an ""emergency"", but I feel that I use this tape at least 4 times a week.  It's a keeper.",1024963200,7,1083,4.538860103626943
1424139,4,B00005BIG5,"I chose this DVD because I liked Minna's style on the Quick Fix Abs/Arms/Buns/Total Body series.  I don't have Minna's other workouts, but will likely get them soon because I enjoy this one.
There has been some criticism about the dance-cardio segment of this DVD.  I would say that it is a little confusing and at times I have felt a little silly doing it, but each time I do the workout I improve and it is always fun.  The challenge of wanting to do all of the steps well and not look too much like a freak keeps me coming back.  30 minutes of this cardio workout beats 30 minutes on the treadmill any day.
The toning segment is challenging enough to make me feel like I am using my time wisely, but it doesn't kill me, so I won't find excuses to skip it altogether.
I would agree with other reviewers that have said if there is a true ""emergency"" and you are working toward fast results for something specific, you might want something that is more intense.  But for a workout that will keep you coming back everyday, this is a pretty good one.",1023408000,4,1048,4.299492385786802

My kids love to watch me doing it too, usually they tug at me and beg me to get them this and that but since I got this dvd they just sit and watch.  The first couple of times I did the exercises it was a little confusing but fun enough to try again the next day, now that 2 weeks have gone by I seem to be in tune with it all and enjoying it just as much as the first time.

1424142,4,B00005BIG5,"Minna's Emergency workout has been a refreshing change from my usual Cruch FatBlaster Goes Latin tape. There are a lot of chachas and mambos and other moves that are very similar, so if you learn one of these tapes you can easily do the other. The cardio is very dancy, which I love, and Minna actually makes me laugh as I go through some of the more dramatic steps. The cardio makes me sweat - it is a good moderate workout but it does not wear you out so you cant do anything else that day.
I am not used to weights in the slightest so the Toning section really gets me. It took awhile to get the coordination to do two moves at once in this section, but I am feeling the toning - particularly in my arms. Beginners like me would benefit from staying to 1 or 2 pound weights for this section.
Overall I found Minna to be encouraging and entertaining. The cuing is good and there is only one step where I felt frustrated because I couldn't see anyone's feet to figure out what the heck was going on. I will continue this tape for the next four weeks and see if it will continue to seem as great as it has so far.",1016409600,2,1113,4.110091743119266

1424144,5,B00005BIG5,"I love this video, particularly the cardio segment. I find that most aerobic workout videos fit one of two extremes. The moves are either very simple and repetitive (and therefore become boring after a few sessions) or the choreography is so complicated and intense that you spend more time in frustration than you do actually working out.  Minna has managed to find the happy medium.  The cardio routine is complex enough that it will take you two or three workouts to get the moves down perfectly, but they're so much fun, that you'll actually look forward to doing this workout. Her instruction is encouraging and clear and her back-up instructors are energetic ""real"" women, not waifly supermodels. The toning section of the video is also very benefitial, in that you work a maximum number of muscle groups in a short amount of time. Some of the toning moves are tricky at first, but you can really feel the burn once you get them down.  I have often avoided workout videos because they make me feel silly, but this is a solid workout that leaves me feeling strong and motivated. Definitely worth the price.",1011657600,8,1111,4.746113989637306

1424147,5,B00005BIG5,"This workout is very good as well as it is used consistently.  If you use this workout as it is written in the 6 week schedule, along with a good diet will give good results.  Most reviews I have read on this video seem like they are either lacking consistency on using the workout or are cheating on their diet.  I guess it really depends on what your goals are.  If you are looking to just be fit then this is a great video with excellent instruction.  However, if you are looking to be very ripped and lean, then this video needs to be combined with an extra workout and a strict balanced diet using supplements such as Xenedrine and other protein powders and supplements.  If this is your goal then you should plan on eating at least six small meals a day along with plenty of water to flush out all the toxins that  build up in the body.  Well it begins to get technical and I am trailing away from the actual review of the video.  I really think that this is one of the best videos for beginners, intermediate, and advanced.  The video promises that in six weeks you can become fit and toned assuming that you follow the workout and eat balanced meals.  Consistency is the key and as long as you are consistent you will see the results that it promises.  I personally find the instruction very easy to follow, and fun.  I do recommend it for people that want to lose the extra pounds, like it says, for weddings, vacations, etc.  I personally think that most people buy a workout video and expect miracles to happen and obviously that is not the case.  Consistency and discipline are key so keep that in mind, not to mention that diet is 80% key.  If you workout 3 hours a day and cheat on your diet, you will never be satisfied with your results.

The aerobics section is pretty dance-based, and it took me a little time to learn it.  The toning section has some innovative moves, but is much easier to learn.
