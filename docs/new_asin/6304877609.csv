  It was a movie I liked and was looking for,sometime and finely found.  I liked the plot and the twist and turns and divided loyalty. For a ""B"" movie the characters are believable and played well.  There are parts of the movie that are dated to the 1990 ies and would never happen today, but if you can look on this movie as what it is a fictional movie set in the 1990 and a movie to enjoy on that basis, you will enjoy it I hope.",1315267200,2,522,4.038834951456311
