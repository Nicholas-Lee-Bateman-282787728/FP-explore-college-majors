8141169,4,B000HT37R2,"Wilma The Witch documents the October 2005 story from the nonchalant attitudes of local Middle Florida Keys residents the day before the storm through the heartbreaking loss and destruction thereafter. The spectacularly rapid recovery of the Keys is also documented. Interviews with people who were caught up in the crisis add dimension and perspective. With this film, Richard E. Warner's off-the-wall documentary manner achieves a new mix of pain and laughter in one highly entertaining movie.",1227830400,2,495,5.526315789473684
