3070383,3,B0011VIO32,"This movie starts out interesting where they are talking about The Philadelphia Experiment / Project Rainbow which were supposedly real events.

But it goes down hill fast.

Some rock climbers find some writing on the side of a mountain which has supposedly been there for 65 million years.  These messages were written by those poor schmucks that they sent back in time but then couldn't bring them back.

When they go back and meet up with those other people they look to be in good health and even after 30 years they still have some of the same clothes they had when they got there.  Think about what people would look like after 30 years with no medical care, etc..

They bring back a dinosaur to our modern world but it is more like Godzilla.  It is impervious to bullets and attacks helicopters.  Dinosaurs were just big animals.

Then at the end the mad scientist who got left back with the dinosaurs so he could close the time portal is there again in our modern world somehow.  I guess they assume the viewer knows what's going on.

A Way to travel through time has been discovered and a team is sent back in time to study Dinosaurs. Years later thay have benn missing for some time and a new team is sent to find them and bring them home but thay also bring a Tyrannosaurus into Modern Suberbia.

The Story is an intrestig journey but the film lacks quit a bit. The CG is decent but is still very Comic-Book looking. The acting is medicore as Christopher Atkins saves the film. Like all the other Asylum films it is classified as C-Grade Cenima but does an ok job with itself. Not a film for High-Octaine Sci-Fi or Horror Fans.",1212364800,6,751,4.28169014084507

3070388,3,B0011VIO32,"Whatever you do, don't show 100 Billion B.C. to a Navy Seal.  It will make him very angry, and you don't want to make a Seal angry.  You see, it's a group of Navy Seals who are chosen to go back in time to rescue an earlier team of soldiers who were unable to return from their virgin time travel mission.  This ""elite"" team doesn't acquit themselves very well, I'm afraid.  A real Navy Seal doesn't get nauseous at the sight of human remains, get all trigger happy when he thinks he sees something, and he sure as heck doesn't turn and run from anyone or anything, even a dinosaur.

Michael Gross plays Dr. Frank Reno, an impossibly old scientist who participated in the Philadelphia Experiment and sent a team of time travelers, led by his own brother, all the way back to 70,000,000 B.C. in 1949.  (The only reason the movie is called 100 Million B.C. because it's a knock-off of the film 10,000 BC, and The Asylum likes to play tricks with potential nave viewers.)  Unable to get the team home, he has spent decades perfecting the technology so he can try again.  When some distinctive cave paintings are discovered, he knows both where and when to find the long-lost team.  Off he goes, along with a team of Navy Seals, back to the Cretaceous Period, but their rescue mission is only half of the story.  The trouble with time portals, you see, is that it makes for a two-way street, permitting anything from the other side to make the jump, as well.  I think you can see where this is going.

While the CGI effects of the dinosaurs and the destruction they wreak are pretty weak, and the story itself even weaker, I was still entertained by 100 Billion B.C.  The film isn't anywhere near as good as other Asylum monster films such as Mega Piranha or Mega Shark vs. Mega Octopus, but this sort of movie really is The Asylum's bread and butter.  You know to expect middling acting performances by has-been actors such as Greg Evigan, cheap special effects, and an average storyline.  This movie sort of shoots itself in the foot near the end, though, as we get a quick stream of scientific psychobabble to explain some unexpected events that, quite frankly, don't make a lick of sense.  Well, there's also the fact that a flaming red, 60-foot dinosaur is routinely able to sneak up on people - that definitely got my goat, as well.  In the end, though, this movie is all about campy fun and the love many of us share for dumb B-movies.  If you don't have the B-movie gene, you'll probably want to stay away from this one.",1352764800,,2524,4.473799126637554
3070389,3,B0011VIO32,"100 million bc is a good movie but again for the asylum it has flaws like the others they made, I will tell you about it right now.

The bad things about this movie are that again the computer graphics are lacking so they need to make it better. The acting is good but they need to put more effort in to their acting skills now. Also on the cover it looks like there is a t.rex but it something else that I don't know. And finally the one scene that the soldier was in the water being attacked by a group of creatures, the camera work was really bad because its just one quick scene after another and it was just blurry, so the camera work needs work.

The good things about this movie is that it has a good level of violence, gore, action, some suspense, and something that will make everyone feel ok with, a good ending.

So keep doing the reviews you feel is right for you.",1345161600,,876,4.111111111111111
3070390,2,B0011VIO32,"I guess for the price we paid for this, we expected that this was not going to be a mind-blowing state of the art CGI graphic containing movie. I was able to purchase this in the cheapie bin, so do yourself a favor, and laugh hysterically at Amazon's asking prices. I got this for about the same price as a happy-meal.

The plot of this is about a scientist who invents time travel, and lost his army buddies (I think one is his brother or something) in what was known as operation something or other, or more popularly known as ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" I'm guessing some time back in the 1950's or very early 60's. He has spent the rest of his days working on the time travel device to get them back and has a breakthrough somewhere close to present day when a bunch of paintings are found on rocks written by the lost group. What is written is pretty laughable and silly, but it kicks the plot forward for the army to recruit the best of the best (pffft) to go back in time and preform a rescue mission to bring the lost ones back from the Jurassic period.

The first leader of the chosen army to go back for the rescue is one terrible actor indeed, his voice was parody-able, and I instantly laughed and made fun of these scenes thinking they where so lame and over-acted by actors who couldn't act for bleep. This time the scientist (played by Michael Gross ""Family Ties/Tremors 1-4) goes back with the team, and they arrive back in the Jurassic period and right away you will have to laugh at these so-called ""Best of the best"" when a few of them just open fire with their automatics and fire continuously at nothing. If these guys where the ""BEST of the BEST"" they would not fire at anything without seeing a confirmed target and what they are about to shoot, usually with one shot... the army is pretty strict about the cost of bullets, or so I hear, from friends who have been in the army and marines etc.. but anyway...

They go back to the Jurassic period and they then find themselves in dangerous territories with some of the WORST CGI dinosaurs I have ever seen. Do you remember back in the late 90's when CGI was still experimental? It's amazing that the CGI in this film is even WORSE then those days, and this a 2008 movie! I have seen better CGI effects done from peoples home movies on Youtube. The scenes of the Rapotor's are shockingly bad, and every-time you see the main big Dinosaur (not sure what it was, but it's not a T-Rex) open it's mouth and scream, it just looks so fake. However, I tried to just ignore this 99 cent graphics department job, and try to follow the plot to see if it was any good.

The team end up finding the lost guys, and they go back to 2008 (I presume) and from then on in the whole thing got a but confusing on who the heck is who, as they come back, and things get a bit chaotic when the large T-Rex looking thing comes back with them and breaks out of the facility and into the streets of L.A. From then on in it's what you expect, trying to stop a Dinosaur from going on a rampage in a major city where no one seems to notice a 20 foot dinosaur roaming the town.
The end of the movie is a bit stupid, it could have been done better, or explained a bit better as to what the heck just happened, and who was who, and why? I think it was explained, and if I paid more attention to character names, I might have had a better understanding of it, but it wasn't worth my time to backtrack.

Overall, it's a low budget action flick with a lot of mistakes to reality, such as a Pterodactyl in the Jurassic period, but if you have never studied Dinosaur timelines, then you won't be bothered by facts.

The whole movie is not all that bad, I give it 2 and a half stars, but I have no urge to ever see it ever again. The CGI is horrible, but the plot of time-lines does have some interesting moments, such as ""What would happen if you went back in time, and you where an object appearing in the exact same place as another object?"". I thought the film was a bit of a combination of Timeline (2003), Stargate (1993/or SG1) and of coarse, Jurassic Park. I even rolled my eyes seeing them running from a T-Rex-looking-thing in a four-wheel drive, thinking to myself ""Where have I seen that before?"". If you can look past the horrible CGI effects, the movie is decent, and watchable from start to finish, but it has no replay value to be seen again. Oh, take my word, the image in the cover of this DVD, the Dinosaurs don't come close to looking even half as good as that in the movie.

Do not kick yourself if you never see this movie, you haven't missed much. It's definitely far from a must-see, and I can only see this being bought by suckers like me who thought ""Ohh, a Jurassic Park like movie for 2 bucks"" or kids/someone obsessed with Dinosaurs. But even the kid will say, ""My Barney the Dinosaur Video has better CGI then this, Ma""",1310083200,,4885,4.263214670981661
3070391,2,B0011VIO32,"Question: How do you know the military was ever successful in manipulating time and space (e.g. The Philadelphia Experiment)? Answer: When cave markings dated approximately 70 million years old read the words, ""Rita Hayworth"". Yep, that's justification enough for me to warrant a group of soldiers to enter a wormhole led by Michael Gross (considering his experience of wormholes from his ""Tremors"" repertoire, just the man for the job) and be teleported back to prehistoric times in search of the previous group sent 60 years earlier. When the survivors of both troops return back to modern times, they are followed by an unexpected traveller... a very ticked off and hungry tyrannosaurus rex! But, why does this T-Rex look so amateurish, so animated? It makes one speculate dinosaurs even existing... oh wait, that's just atrocious CGI effects that The Asylum production company is notorious for having in their usually lackluster films that, nonetheless, always have some wierd charm about them. At least we can rest easy that Greg Evigan is finding work and doesn't have to continue his pipe dreams of recieving royalty checks for a ""B.J. and the Bear"" DVD release. A guaranteed laugh and ""Oh, c'mon!"" will happen during viewing. Also, be prepared for what felt like one of the longest ""Goodbye"" scenes ever filmed. 3.75/10",1287619200,,1327,5.119815668202765
3070392,3,B0011VIO32,"Michael Gross doesn't have a large role but he does it well as an inventor of a time machine. The rest the cast are reasonably engaging as they travel back in time and try to avoid being eaten by a T Rex. In a nutshell this is a decent SciFi for a rainy day. If you enjoy low budget SciFi movies like the SciFi channel puts out this is one of the better ones they have released. A decent story and acting concerning time travel, with not to horrible of special effects make it a good rental or even a buy at the current six dollar price.

3070393,5,B0011VIO32,great movie thumbs up i loved this movie its like back to the future meets jurassic park films its great action and movement and i loved this film u gotta buy it trust me these other reviews don't add up to my review,1278633600,,216,4.046511627906977
3070394,5,B0011VIO32,"This movie sucked so bad it was funny! I bought my copy at CVS for $9.99. I was watching it with my freind. As soon as the dinosaur showed up I started laughing. And I could not stop. They must have spent like a buck fiffty on this movie. My buddies all have this joke now. Whenever we watch Jurassic Park, one of us always says, ""This is Almost as good as 100 million BC"". Never gets old. The dinosaur changes size like 7 different times. It starts off maybe 15 feet tall, then goes to about 40 feet, then 20, back to fifteen. It's feet are so out of proportion with its body. And I'm sorry but you can't tell me that a military Hellicopter with armour peircing rounds would not kill that THING. It would get cut in half.

Any way thats why I like this movie. It made NOOOOO sense had horrible effects. Terrible acting. And all of this plus the Gag Reel made it FUNNY AS HELL. I loved it and I Will  keep it as a joke. It's a modern day Titanic.

The DVD video and sound quality were top notch. Much better enjoyment than watching it on the Sci-Fi channel, without any cuts or edits. I was entertained with this movie.

Maybe some of the reviewers saw it on the Sci-Fi channel only like I did originally. It was less quality and cut up and edited when on TV.",1236384000,,473,4.141304347826087
3070397,1,B0011VIO32,"Step right up folks, and see plastic dinosaur heads, 3rd rate special effects of people jumping very slowly from airplanes, actors who're supposed to be living in 100,000 sporting LA blonde streaked hairdos and girls in MTV outdoor outfits. This movie is so terribly bad that I'm seriously thinking of buying it to show at parties, along with another horror special, Hands of Manos, made for probably a little more money--like 35 cents.

Filmed in some rocky canyon that's supposed to be premordial forest, the cast doesn't have a chance of saving this truly horrendous bomb. Christopher Atkins is shown several times aiming his trustly bow-and-arrow as he takes aim against a plastic dinosaur. An arrow is certainly the most destructive weapon in the world to kill a roaring dinosaur. and for some reason, the camera always moves closer to Atkins right eye as he prepares to slay the beast--the right eye staying on the screen for several seconds. Does this mean something? Atkins and his right eye?

Anyway, whenever the cast members see a monster, they look at it like it's a growling dog--expressing zero fear or horror. In another scene, they're supposedly terrorized by a giant croc. Except you never see the croc. The screen is filled with fangs and red images of some croc from another movie. and then the cast is terrorized again by something roraring off camera. They all stare at something behind the camera--but we never see it.

By this time, I had had enough and hit eject. My nightmares are filled with plastic heads of dinosaur being animated by a hidden hand, and then in one scene, you actually see the man beneath the dinosaur head as it bobs around in the air like it's just had a bad overdose of LSD.

We need more flicks like this to remind us of the days when Hollywood used to turn out genuine classics--like The thing, Alien, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. I immediately slipped John carpenter's The Thing into my machine and was lost in horror heaven.",1233532800,4,1985,4.778425655976676

Off he goes, along with a team of Navy Seals, back to the Cretaceous Period, but their rescue mission is only half of the story.  The trouble with time portals, you see, is that it makes for a two-way street, permitting anything from the other side to make the jump, as well.  I think you can see where this is going.

While the CGI effects of the dinosaurs and the destruction they wreak are pretty weak, and the story itself even weaker, I was still entertained by 100 Billion B.C.  The film isn't anywhere near as good as other Asylum monster films such as Mega Piranha or Mega Shark vs. Mega Octopus, but this sort of movie really is The Asylum's bread and butter.  You know to expect middling acting performances by has-been actors such as Greg Evigan, cheap special effects, and an average storyline.  This movie sort of shoots itself in the foot near the end, though, as we get a quick stream of scientific psychobabble to explain some unexpected events that, quite frankly, don't make a lick of sense.  Well, there's also the fact that a flaming red, 60-foot dinosaur is routinely able to sneak up on people - that definitely got my goat, as well.  In the end, though, this movie is all about campy fun and the love many of us share for dumb B-movies.  If you don't have the B-movie gene, you'll probably want to stay away from this one.",1352764800,,2524,4.473799126637554
3304886,3,B0011VIO32,"100 million bc is a good movie but again for the asylum it has flaws like the others they made, I will tell you about it right now.

The bad things about this movie are that again the computer graphics are lacking so they need to make it better. The acting is good but they need to put more effort in to their acting skills now. Also on the cover it looks like there is a t.rex but it something else that I don't know. And finally the one scene that the soldier was in the water being attacked by a group of creatures, the camera work was really bad because its just one quick scene after another and it was just blurry, so the camera work needs work.

The good things about this movie is that it has a good level of violence, gore, action, some suspense, and something that will make everyone feel ok with, a good ending.

So keep doing the reviews you feel is right for you.",1345161600,,876,4.111111111111111
3304887,2,B0011VIO32,"I guess for the price we paid for this, we expected that this was not going to be a mind-blowing state of the art CGI graphic containing movie. I was able to purchase this in the cheapie bin, so do yourself a favor, and laugh hysterically at Amazon's asking prices. I got this for about the same price as a happy-meal.

The plot of this is about a scientist who invents time travel, and lost his army buddies (I think one is his brother or something) in what was known as operation something or other, or more popularly known as ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" I'm guessing some time back in the 1950's or very early 60's. He has spent the rest of his days working on the time travel device to get them back and has a breakthrough somewhere close to present day when a bunch of paintings are found on rocks written by the lost group. What is written is pretty laughable and silly, but it kicks the plot forward for the army to recruit the best of the best (pffft) to go back in time and preform a rescue mission to bring the lost ones back from the Jurassic period.

The first leader of the chosen army to go back for the rescue is one terrible actor indeed, his voice was parody-able, and I instantly laughed and made fun of these scenes thinking they where so lame and over-acted by actors who couldn't act for bleep. This time the scientist (played by Michael Gross ""Family Ties/Tremors 1-4) goes back with the team, and they arrive back in the Jurassic period and right away you will have to laugh at these so-called ""Best of the best"" when a few of them just open fire with their automatics and fire continuously at nothing. If these guys where the ""BEST of the BEST"" they would not fire at anything without seeing a confirmed target and what they are about to shoot, usually with one shot... the army is pretty strict about the cost of bullets, or so I hear, from friends who have been in the army and marines etc.. but anyway...

They go back to the Jurassic period and they then find themselves in dangerous territories with some of the WORST CGI dinosaurs I have ever seen. Do you remember back in the late 90's when CGI was still experimental? It's amazing that the CGI in this film is even WORSE then those days, and this a 2008 movie! I have seen better CGI effects done from peoples home movies on Youtube. The scenes of the Rapotor's are shockingly bad, and every-time you see the main big Dinosaur (not sure what it was, but it's not a T-Rex) open it's mouth and scream, it just looks so fake. However, I tried to just ignore this 99 cent graphics department job, and try to follow the plot to see if it was any good.

The team end up finding the lost guys, and they go back to 2008 (I presume) and from then on in the whole thing got a but confusing on who the heck is who, as they come back, and things get a bit chaotic when the large T-Rex looking thing comes back with them and breaks out of the facility and into the streets of L.A. From then on in it's what you expect, trying to stop a Dinosaur from going on a rampage in a major city where no one seems to notice a 20 foot dinosaur roaming the town.
The end of the movie is a bit stupid, it could have been done better, or explained a bit better as to what the heck just happened, and who was who, and why? I think it was explained, and if I paid more attention to character names, I might have had a better understanding of it, but it wasn't worth my time to backtrack.

Overall, it's a low budget action flick with a lot of mistakes to reality, such as a Pterodactyl in the Jurassic period, but if you have never studied Dinosaur timelines, then you won't be bothered by facts.

The whole movie is not all that bad, I give it 2 and a half stars, but I have no urge to ever see it ever again. The CGI is horrible, but the plot of time-lines does have some interesting moments, such as ""What would happen if you went back in time, and you where an object appearing in the exact same place as another object?"". I thought the film was a bit of a combination of Timeline (2003), Stargate (1993/or SG1) and of coarse, Jurassic Park. I even rolled my eyes seeing them running from a T-Rex-looking-thing in a four-wheel drive, thinking to myself ""Where have I seen that before?"". If you can look past the horrible CGI effects, the movie is decent, and watchable from start to finish, but it has no replay value to be seen again. Oh, take my word, the image in the cover of this DVD, the Dinosaurs don't come close to looking even half as good as that in the movie.

Do not kick yourself if you never see this movie, you haven't missed much. It's definitely far from a must-see, and I can only see this being bought by suckers like me who thought ""Ohh, a Jurassic Park like movie for 2 bucks"" or kids/someone obsessed with Dinosaurs. But even the kid will say, ""My Barney the Dinosaur Video has better CGI then this, Ma""",1310083200,,4885,4.263214670981661
3304888,2,B0011VIO32,"Question: How do you know the military was ever successful in manipulating time and space (e.g. The Philadelphia Experiment)? Answer: When cave markings dated approximately 70 million years old read the words, ""Rita Hayworth"". Yep, that's justification enough for me to warrant a group of soldiers to enter a wormhole led by Michael Gross (considering his experience of wormholes from his ""Tremors"" repertoire, just the man for the job) and be teleported back to prehistoric times in search of the previous group sent 60 years earlier. When the survivors of both troops return back to modern times, they are followed by an unexpected traveller... a very ticked off and hungry tyrannosaurus rex! But, why does this T-Rex look so amateurish, so animated? It makes one speculate dinosaurs even existing... oh wait, that's just atrocious CGI effects that The Asylum production company is notorious for having in their usually lackluster films that, nonetheless, always have some wierd charm about them. At least we can rest easy that Greg Evigan is finding work and doesn't have to continue his pipe dreams of recieving royalty checks for a ""B.J. and the Bear"" DVD release. A guaranteed laugh and ""Oh, c'mon!"" will happen during viewing. Also, be prepared for what felt like one of the longest ""Goodbye"" scenes ever filmed. 3.75/10",1287619200,,1327,5.119815668202765
3304889,3,B0011VIO32,"Michael Gross doesn't have a large role but he does it well as an inventor of a time machine. The rest the cast are reasonably engaging as they travel back in time and try to avoid being eaten by a T Rex. In a nutshell this is a decent SciFi for a rainy day. If you enjoy low budget SciFi movies like the SciFi channel puts out this is one of the better ones they have released. A decent story and acting concerning time travel, with not to horrible of special effects make it a good rental or even a buy at the current six dollar price.

3304891,5,B0011VIO32,"This movie sucked so bad it was funny! I bought my copy at CVS for $9.99. I was watching it with my freind. As soon as the dinosaur showed up I started laughing. And I could not stop. They must have spent like a buck fiffty on this movie. My buddies all have this joke now. Whenever we watch Jurassic Park, one of us always says, ""This is Almost as good as 100 million BC"". Never gets old. The dinosaur changes size like 7 different times. It starts off maybe 15 feet tall, then goes to about 40 feet, then 20, back to fifteen. It's feet are so out of proportion with its body. And I'm sorry but you can't tell me that a military Hellicopter with armour peircing rounds would not kill that THING. It would get cut in half.

Any way thats why I like this movie. It made NOOOOO sense had horrible effects. Terrible acting. And all of this plus the Gag Reel made it FUNNY AS HELL. I loved it and I Will  keep it as a joke. It's a modern day Titanic.

Maybe some of the reviewers saw it on the Sci-Fi channel only like I did originally. It was less quality and cut up and edited when on TV.",1236384000,,473,4.141304347826087
3304894,1,B0011VIO32,"Step right up folks, and see plastic dinosaur heads, 3rd rate special effects of people jumping very slowly from airplanes, actors who're supposed to be living in 100,000 sporting LA blonde streaked hairdos and girls in MTV outdoor outfits. This movie is so terribly bad that I'm seriously thinking of buying it to show at parties, along with another horror special, Hands of Manos, made for probably a little more money--like 35 cents.

Filmed in some rocky canyon that's supposed to be premordial forest, the cast doesn't have a chance of saving this truly horrendous bomb. Christopher Atkins is shown several times aiming his trustly bow-and-arrow as he takes aim against a plastic dinosaur. An arrow is certainly the most destructive weapon in the world to kill a roaring dinosaur. and for some reason, the camera always moves closer to Atkins right eye as he prepares to slay the beast--the right eye staying on the screen for several seconds. Does this mean something? Atkins and his right eye?

Anyway, whenever the cast members see a monster, they look at it like it's a growling dog--expressing zero fear or horror. In another scene, they're supposedly terrorized by a giant croc. Except you never see the croc. The screen is filled with fangs and red images of some croc from another movie. and then the cast is terrorized again by something roraring off camera. They all stare at something behind the camera--but we never see it.

By this time, I had had enough and hit eject. My nightmares are filled with plastic heads of dinosaur being animated by a hidden hand, and then in one scene, you actually see the man beneath the dinosaur head as it bobs around in the air like it's just had a bad overdose of LSD.

We need more flicks like this to remind us of the days when Hollywood used to turn out genuine classics--like The thing, Alien, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. I immediately slipped John carpenter's The Thing into my machine and was lost in horror heaven.",1233532800,4,1985,4.778425655976676

Surprisingly, the 4 that were stuck in 100MBC, had 90's type clothing. They should've still had pieces from when they left 1949. I could go on and on really.

8242783,5,B0011VIO32,"Every once in a while you see one of these low budget independent films that really amazes you. For me, this was one of those films.

Briefly, the film is about a team of Navy Seals from present day that goes on a search and rescue mission back to the Cretaceous to find a group that had been sent there in the 1940's. They arrive, have some rough patches, find the survivors, and bring them back, except that by mistake a giant meat eating dinosaur back with them.

Despite some of the dinosaurs being unrealistic and the mediocre special effects, the movie managed to capture, in my opinion, what it must have been like to live in those times. The place was extremely inhospitable to mammalian life, which is why most did not evolve larger than the size of a rat until after the dinosaurs died. To live in the Cretaceous was to be in constant danger, never knowing when one dinosaur or the other was going to come up and snap you into its jaws.

Also, most of the actors did an amazing job of making you believe, for example, that they had been trapped in prehistoric times for six years, or showing real emotion in the scenes where they were about to separate from loved ones. The best part of the movie is the realistic dialogue. The script writer did an excellent job.",1374624000,2,1273,4.408510638297872
