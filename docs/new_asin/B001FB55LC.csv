STARRING: Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Shepard, Bailee Madison, Taylor Geare, Patrick Flueger, Clifton Collins Jr., Ethan Suplee and Mare Winningham

WRITTEN BY: David Benioff; based on the screenplay Bodre by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen

DIRECTED BY: Jim Sheridan
Rated: R
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 04 December 2009

I have always wondered if maybe Tobey Maguire had a dark side to him, buried away, deep behind that charming Peter Parker smile. Now that I have seen his disturbing performance in Brothers; I know that he does.

He plays Capt. Sam Hill of the U.S. Marine Corps and he does it miraculously. At first everything seems to be ok with Sam. He has a wonderful wife and two beautiful kids; a strong relationship with his father and he loves and defends his brother. However, all of that is about to change.

We learn early on in the film that he is to be shipped off to Afghanistan. He is proud to be a Marine and is equally proud to go.

Just days before he leaves, his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is released from prison. We don't know why, but Sam's wife Grace (Natalie Portman) isn't very fond of him.

Their father Hank (Sam Shepard) agrees with Grace entirely. In his eyes, the two brothers are worlds apart. Sam is the saint and Tommy is the family screw-up. Having been a Marine himself, Hank respects Sam and constantly puts Tommy down for not being more like his brother. There are some very well acted scenes between the three of these Hollywood greats; particularly the first dinner scene when Tommy is released from prison.

It's not a hard sell at all to buy Gyllenhaal and Maguire as brothers. Several people over the years have commented on their similar looks; they have been mistaken for one-another; and at one point Gyllenhaal was rumored to be relieving Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise. Their on-screen chemistry is more than believable, so fans will enjoy their scenes together, as did I.

The plot thickens when Sam's chopper goes down and he and his crew are believed to be dead. We know from the trailers, the opening credits saying Tobey Maguire's name first and just common movie-goer knowledge, that he is not dead. If you haven't seen the trailers, relax; it's revealed to us right away that he is alive.

Himself and another soldier have in fact been captured by the Taliban and are brought to a secret hideout in the Afghan Mountains. Having done a tour of duty there myself, I can tell you that wherever they filmed this sequence is very close to the real deal.

Sam is an officer and his counterpart is an enlisted Private. He constantly reminds him of their differences in rank throughout all of their scenes together.

I found this annoying as I don't think that nine out of 10 soldiers would be that over-zealous about their rank in a situation like this, but there is always that one guy. And it does serve a purpose as Sam is very good at reading people and can see that this particular soldier is weak and will most likely not be able to handle whatever sadistic torture their captors have in store for them.

I found the scenes in Afghanistan to be the most entertaining portion of the film and there are several of them. Tobey Maguire does an amazing job in these scenes and will show you dimensions of himself that you have never seen before. He is driven to do things that a lot of people may say they would never do in that situation; but I don't think any of us ever really know what we are or aren't capable of until we are put into a certain situation. This film will really make you ask yourself what you would do if you were in Sam's shoes.

I'm displeased to report that the rest of the film was a letdown. The only positive thing I really took from the rest of it, were the amazing performances of all the actors. There wasn't a single person in this film that didn't bring every bit of what they had to offer to each and every scene. Even small characters were casted well and delivered excellent performances. I don't know how they got Clifton Collins Jr. to do the two or three tiny scenes that he was in; but they did and he brought an impressive performance with him.

Natalie Portman is as amazing as ever. She plays Grace so effortlessly and has great chemistry with the actors playing her family. In the scene where she receives the news of her husband's death, she goes from smiling to an absolute wreck without so much as a second going by.

I feel Jake Gyllenhaal was cheated out of some screen time in the film. You never really got to know his character as well as you should have. Regardless of this, he still does a knock-out job with it anyway.

The same goes for Sam Shepard. I felt like this character should have had either a bigger part in the story or a smaller one. With an actor like Sam Shepard, the answer better be bigger. We get absolutely no closure from his character's issues in the film.

Scenes seem poorly edited and at times, too glamorized for this film. I feel like a lot of them were too bright and didn't fit well with the dark tones of the film as a whole.

The most disappointing piece of the film was the romance between Tommy and Grace. I kept waiting for there to be this moment where they fall in love for each other and have a secret affair; but it never happens. They have one intimate moment where they share a kiss and both of them seem to regret it instantly and it is never brought up again; because right after it they discover Sam is still alive.

I was expecting this huge love triangle to unfold. I think that based on the trailer and the poster alone, most would agree with me in thinking this is what was going to happen. There was opportunity after opportunity for there to be moments between them. Then when the romance never comes you are left wondering `what was the point of those scenes then?' Take the scene where she leaves in the middle of the night to go and pick Tommy up from the bar; or the idea of him offering to rebuild her kitchen for her. These are classic set-up scenes for a romance to ensue, and there is nothing!

I get the feeling that the filmmakers' intentions were not to have the over-done love triangle, and instead let it all be in Sam's head. For some, this may be a pleasant aspect of the film. I can even appreciate the originality in that; it's just that I kept expecting these other things to happen and when they didn't, I was disappointed.

I thought there would be hot and forbidden sex scenes; followed by the heart-throbbing suspense of them trying to cover it up, as they realize they are still in love even after Sam is back in the picture.

What we get instead is Sam returning and being wacked out of his frigging mind from the trauma he experienced over there. He is deathly thin and this adds a great deal to him being creepy. His children are afraid of him and his wife looks at him as if he is another man altogether.

Rather than the suspense, we just get what I would call annoying drama. Sam flat out confronts Tommy about sleeping with his wife, and Tommy never once denies having done so. Well no wonder the poor guy continues to think that something is going on!

As if that wasn't bad enough, one of Sam's daughters is so distraught that her daddy isn't the same anymore, she screams at him and tells him that her mother and Tommy have sex all the time. She yells this in front of everyone at the dinner table, and neither Grace nor Tommy says anything to comfort Sam by assuring him, this is untrue. Had it happened, this would have been a little bit more tolerable; but it didn't! Nothing happened! So why wouldn't either of them say something to deny it?

As far as I'm concerned, there was no justification for the daughter to act that way in the first place. There wasn't enough suspense of her daddy being frightening and different that would have caused her to do this. It seemed like two or three scenes between the two of them had been deleted and made it play-out wrong.

It's not a bad movie; just not what I had anticipated and looked forward to it being, nor is it what it could have easily been. I'm sure a lot of people will still enjoy it. In the meantime, to hold me over until another film delivers hot steamy romance mixed with suspense and a classic love triangle; I suppose I can watch Pearl Harbor again.",1268524800,25,8351,4.444081098757358
3573652,3,B001FB55LC,"This movie was very intersting, however, I was extremely disgusted with the way Hollywood originally marketed it--as a thriller--in the previews leading up to its release.  I couldn't wait to see this movie when it first came out off that alone.  It was almost billed as a Fatal Attraction-esque movie from the previews alone: Widow becomes romantically entangled with her dead husband's brother only to find out that he isn't dead at all and they try to conceal their relationship until he discovers the truth and loses it.  On the flip, the movie was basically about a husband who is presumed dead after being a POW in Iraq, his fight for survival during that harrowing time, and his failed attempts to adjust once he finally comes home.  Only secondary to this is his brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) stepping in to be a father figure of sorts and the romantic sparks between he and his sister-in-law (Natalie Portman).  I came into the movie expecting to see one thing, but got something entirely different.

What I got wasn't bad at all though only because of the caliber of acting.  Tobey Maguire in particular was so haunting that I was downright on the edge of my seat waiting to see that moment where he finally cracked and exploded.  Though the scene wasn't what you would expect if you let the previews fool you, it was very intense and built up nicely.  Another performance that left me in awe was the young lady who portrayed the eldest daughter.  The fire in her during that kitchen scene when she blurted out her view on the situation between her mother and uncle was magnificent; she had daggers in her eyes and was fuming, it was just beyond believeable to watch in my opinion.  Jake Gyllenhaal had his moments too, but he was his purest when he saved his character's brother from doing the unthinkable in the end.  I felt Natalie Portman's character didn't have much depth, and she was clearly overshadowed by Maguire and Gyllenhaal's performances.

I would give it 4 stars, but again, I was disappointed at the slant the studio took just to get people into the theater.  Clearly the Academy took note of that as well, which is why its nominations didn't make it beyond the Golden Globes, which is sad because honestly this movie had a fighting chance had it just been presented as is.",1268179200,3,2296,4.67910447761194
3573653,5,B001FB55LC,"I saw this film in the theatres and thought it was amazing!
Not only is it timely, but it's one of those stories which could actually happen,
which gives it even more gravity. Tobey Maguire gives what I think is one of the
best performances of his career...so far!
He just oozes all the right emotions to bring this character to life in a way
that leaps off the screen!---He's intense in this!!
Jake Gyllenhaal is also great as the well-intentioned brother who tries to
compensate for what they all think is his brother's death (MIA), stepping in
as a father figure to his nieces and comforting his grieving sister-in-law,
who is played very well by Natalie Portman.

Jake's character is kind of the black sheep of the family with a rowdy past,
but he truly redeems himself in the wake of what he thinks is his brother's
death. Natalie and Jake's characters begin to fall in love, which is
weird for both of them, given the situation. But they restrain themselves
for the moment. Then all of a sudden the brother/husband/father appears
back on the scene, having been through hell as an afghani POW who has been
tortured and force to do a horrible thing that really destroys him both
mentally and spiritually. When he returns, his experiences in the middle east
have drastically changed him from the person who they all knew before he left for the war.
The story gets more and more intense and without giving away anymore,
it just suffices to say that this is one of the best films of 2009/2010.
A great add to any DVD collection.",1266710400,14,1529,4.58029197080292

3573656,1,B001FB55LC,"In her review of ""Brothers"" Kathleen C. Fennessy writes, ""Back in New Mexico, Grace and Tommy grow closer, stopping just short of a full-blown affair (in [Danish director] Susanne Bier's original [Danish movie ""Brdre"" starring Connie Nielsen], they take the plunge).""

No they don't!  Just as in the American re-make, brother- and sister-in-law come close but they never actually have sex!  They both love their fallen brother and husband and would have betrayed the soldier's love, making them both unworthy of his sacrafice in Afghanistan!  (I'm sure that if the American version came first they would've slept together.)

Ms. Fennessy should actually WATCH the movies she writes about on Amazon.com!",1265414400,5,702,5.345454545454546
3573657,5,B001FB55LC,"This ensemble cast delivered the goods and nailed each of their performances.

Tobey and Jake are very believable as brothers and Natalie was the true heart of this story as her beloved husband played by Tobey goes to a very dark place as a result of his experience in the war. All of the cast members were strong and made you really care about what happened to them.

I felt their happiness,pain and sadness.

Jim Sheridan the director is true to his style and storytelling theme about war and its effects on a marriage,family and forgiveness.

There was one scene with he and Natalie that reduced me to tears and that is not an easy thing to do, thus the five star rating which is well earned and deserved!",1265241600,75,708,4.465116279069767
3573658,4,B001FB55LC,"This is one of those times that I wish Amazon let us use half stars as I think this is more 3.5 stars than 4 full ones.  I have not seen the Danish film and now I wish I had.  This is because I just read here that in the Danish movie, the wife does start an affair with her brother-in-law.  This film lost a lot of its punch when the director shied away from letting that happen in the American remake.  As a result, it's as if someone punctured the air out of the movie past the halfway point. This should be a very taut, sharp drama throughout , which I suspect he Danish one is. The American one simply cannot sustain the same tension when the guts were removed from the script.  The actors are very good, both the brothers and the wife.  I think they make the best of what they've got.  So the problem must be that director Jim Sheridan was worried about losing audience if he kept the film as stark as the Danish version (that a film is Scandinavian and stark borders on redundancy). This almost always happens in American remakes.  We seem to do better when we use our own original source material.

3573659,5,B001FB55LC,"I loved this movie. It instantly became one of my top 5 ever. Some of the films most intense moments are some of the most intense I've ever seen. Tobey Maguire deserves an oscar for this. Some critics have been saying that this movie is more of a melodrama than the original, but I would greatly disagreee. Great acting from all involved (including the dad) and terrific writing. After I saw it, I couldn't stop thinking about it the rest of the week. Highly recommended.",1264636800,34,471,4.552941176470588
3573660,3,B001FB55LC,"The trailer for 'Brothers' presents an interesting premise : the brother of a fallen Marine takes up with the widowed wife and children. When the Marine turns out to be alive, he returns to a home that doesn't perceive as home anymore, either on the surface nor beneath it.

Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhall each turned in good performances in leading roles, as did Sam Shepherd in his supporting role, but the performance that most impressed me was Tobey Maguire's. I've never viewed Maguire as an actor with a lot of range or depth. In fact, it took me a while into this movie to get ""Spider-Man"" out of my head. But his turn as the returning war veteran was the standout of this film. Not Oscar-caliber, but definitely noteworthy, and he showed much more depth than I expected from him in his role.

The pacing of the movie is slow, but not terribly slow. The story is very well-written, and there is some excellent metaphorical usage throughout, but the execution of it all simply falls flat. This movie could have easily slipped into ""message film"" mode, but it avoided that trap. We are reminded, however, that the price of war isn't measured in dollars. It's worth noting that I found the ending to be appropriate and satisfying in its subtlety.

The mark of a good and/or memorable movie is one that you're able to discuss long after you've left the theater. My friend and I had stopped talking about it less than five minutes after we walked out. This is not a bad movie, but it's just not a movie that stays with you. An excellent cast, and certainly not a bad movie, but not a must-see film.",1260057600,4,1605,4.546712802768166

But those people were real to me- small town PA people. I went to upgrade. w/ them at MICA. But all of it was amazing- people who did not understand what was happening to them. The romance is understand and ""window dressing"" for the movie

Brothers-  3 and 3/4 stars. felt a little manipulative> The fixing up the kitchen ...the result. And a happy ending where everything gets figured out- heh. Acting was good- no one made my cringe.

BUT main point- WAR is horrible, so why do we keep repeating it ? Do men really need to go off to WAR and see their bubbies killed to get in
touch with their feelings ? Sorry, I want more movies about draft dodgers- esp. in NON Am. countries. But lets face- there are those who love to kill and THAT is what sells and armies are built on. Indeed, the deer hunter says it better- with DeNiro unable to kill dear anymore.

This movies is unbelievable and anti-military BS. I can't believe all of the positive reviews.
First; The Captain would not have been designated dead when he was MIA.
Second; There is NO WAY any Marine, let alone a Marine Captain would have killed one of his own men. The Marines are all about no one left behind. The Captain would have killed himself before killing his Private. That aspect of the movie just pissed me off.
From that point on the movie was difficult to get through without breaking my TV but I watched it all just to make sure I didn't miss a surprise ending, which there wasn't.",1517270400,2,752,4.378571428571429

My only complaint: the entire film hinges on a premature KIA report. Given that there are still MIAs left over from Vietnam, it's questionable that a KIA report would be made without proof.
Hard to watch at times because it was so painful - but well worth it.

I think the acting overall was pretty decent.  I mean I wouldn't watch it a second time, though.  I noticed a lot of reviews had mentioned PTSD so I thought they would explore that a little more in the movie.  They show some of the effects of it but they never really went into the healing process.

3575115,4,B001FB55LC,"It just so happened that I saw this around the same time as I saw the wretched ""Imaginary Heroes"" (IH).  For all the difference in setting, the plot has a similar shape, but here it's handled with respect for the audience and there is definitely no smiley-happy uplift, but instead a soberly optimistic ending.  As with IH, we have two brothers, one of whom, Sam Cahill (Toby Maguire), is a gifted athlete favored by his father, Hank (Sam Shepard).  The other, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), has run into trouble with the law, and at the movie's beginning, we see him meeting his brother on his release from jail.  Hank'sfavoritism has clearly not embittered the brothers' relationship, however, and this will prove important later.  Sam, recently married to Grace (Natalie Portman), is a Captain in the Marine Corps and is posted to Afghanistan.  Soon, he goes missing and is presumed dead.  We, the audience, soon know what his family does not -- that he is not dead but in captivity and his experience in captivity (I'm giving nothing away here) is traumatic.  In his absence, Tom becomes like a father to Sam's little girl and a confidant to his wife, and he doesn't allow his father's continuing diminishment of him to affect his relations with the rest of his family.  Gyllenhaal's performance as a decent man trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation is very touching and engaging.  It's clear that he and Grace are increasingly drawn to one another . . . and then Sam is rescued and comes back.

It's not enough to say that Sam has PTSD -- by this time, we know exactly what he has been through, and Maguire gives a vivid performance of a damaged man whose difficulties have his family walking on eggs.  And he KNOWS he's damaged, which makes matters all the more poignant.  The ending is wrenching, without foreclosing the possibility of a more hopeful future.  The acting is splendid, throughout -- Shepard does the crusty veteran very well, and Portman -- in perhaps the least complicated role -- is very convincing.  The movie was based on a Swedish original, with the Sam character being a UN peacekeeper.  The story has been deftly Americanized and is well-written and vividly shot.  Good stuff.",1468108800,,2220,4.754569190600522

3575323,3,B001FB55LC,"since I have seen both versions of Brothers, I am sorry to state:

The original version - from Denmark in 2004 - touches me much more than the remake. Here are some tangible reasons for me:

1. The camera is always extremely close and personal with the feelings of the characters - very often hands, lips and eyes in close-up. Simply breathtaking, when directed by Susanne Bier, Denmark ......... nothing like that in Brothers US.

2. The performer in the Danish version play all just wonderful and believable, it almost felt like in a documentary - in Brothers US this is prevented by the style. Typical Hollywood look of frames and editing.
Plus: Much better acting of the two brothers and the two children in Brothers-dk 2004 !!

3. Danes do not lie. It's true.

Thus, ""Brothers"" from Denmark is clearly superior to the American remake by Jim Sheridan (who nonetheless also proved a good director before).
For a wider audience, this remake is just prone to too many compromises and softens the harsh reality of the sady-sad story too much.

Conclusion:
to me this would equal 4 stars for this movie - yes, if only I did not know the original from denmark. Therefore only 3.49 stars.
(Incidentally, almost the same happened to me when rating the Swedish drama ""Let the Right One in"" compared to its US remake ""Let me in"")

cheers, >>>>> th ntwstr - rating = 70%
Hence: better prefer the danish original version : Brothers 2004 [DVD] -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brothers/dp/B000ADWDF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brothers</a>

3575326,5,B001FB55LC,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It surprises me that it sort of flew under the radar, especially considering the casting.  Most people seem to have missed this one.  The acting is superb, and it is an intense plot.  If all you are looking for is a ""war"" movie with tons of action sequences, keep looking.  This film has more to do with the consequences of war at home.",1453766400,2,365,4.231884057971015

3575641,5,B001FB55LC,"This is a pretty good movie. People kept telling me to watch it and although it's not a new movie, I have only recently gotten to sit down and watch it. It has a lot of nice drama and action and I think that the actors did a nice job. Tobey Maguire is not normally one of my favorite actors but he did well in this. The movie has some unexpected surprises and a decent ending.
So yes, overall, I did enjoy this movie. Gave it to my husband as one of his gifts for his bday and he was happy too.
The price was also great.",1442102400,3,520,3.869158878504673

3575979,5,B001FB55LC,Toby's performance is outstanding in this film. He captured every emotion and took them to the next level. The story is sad to say the least but also I think very real. Gyllenhaal also did an amazing job as his brother and the bond they had was personal. Tragedy plagues this movie but also hope does as well. Definitely worth watching.... Strong language throughout and an implied sex scene as well as torture and torment are included in this film.,1438560000,4,449,4.625

3576596,4,B001FB55LC,Good acting and interesting script.  The only thing that bothers me is the loss of an American soldier's life at the hands of another American soldier.  My friend came back from Iraq a changed man.  He worries about IEDs and he had to take a month off from work to get used to American life.  This movie is recommended.,1432425600,,319,4.3559322033898304

8301722,5,B001FB55LC,Just when I was about to watch it I realized I had seen it already and thoroughly enjoyed it. sadly I the type of person who doesn't really watch movies more then once. I feel as though there are so many great movies out there I rather try and watch them all then watch them twice. HOWEVER do not skip past this one. It is a great film full of emotion that will leave you at the edge of your seat. Ignore any and all negative reviews. Seriously.,1526860800,,445,4.068181818181818
