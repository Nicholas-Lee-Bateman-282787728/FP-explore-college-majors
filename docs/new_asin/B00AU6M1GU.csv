8557894,5,B00AU6M1GU,"The Sign of Four, 1932 film

This was adapted from the story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The film begins with a view of a building in the country. Next a map with names in a corner. Jonathan Small tells of a treasure buried in a fort in Agra, India. Major Sholto and Captain Morstan search for the jewels. Will there be a conflict? Retired Major Sholto reads about the escape of Jonathan Small. He calls his two sons and tells them of his secret. Then he collapses after seeing a face in the window. He only mentioned ""Pondicherry Lodge"". A man gets another tattoo from Jonathan Small, and we learn his history. Mary Morstan owns a florist shop and gets a letter with a strand of pearls! Two men invade the Sholto home to search for the treasure, and learn the facts from Thaddeus Sholto. Mary Morstan's safe is cracked to get at the contents. A letter calls her to a meeting, another letter warns against going to the police.

Miss Morstan visits Sherlock Holmes who does private enquiries. How can Holmes know what Dr. Watson was thinking? Holmes deduces the personality from the written notes. ""Will you be my other friend?"" ""Amazing!"" ""No, elementary my dear Watson."" They arm themselves for that meeting (the right to keep and bear arms). They go to visit brother Bartholomew Sholto at Pondicherry Lodge. They find Bartholomew dead in a locked room on the second floor! The treasure is gone! Sholto was killed by a dart that had an alkaloid poison. This kind of blowpipe is used in the Andaman Islands. The floor shows a round print like from a wooden stump of a leg. Holmes deduces who it was. The police arrive, Inspector Jones takes notes and makes a quick decision. Holmes will talk to Mordecai Smith about the rope left on the roof; he explains why.

A bearded sailor visits a tavern and asks for Mordecai. His wife tells about his customer. Small wants Morstan's pearls, they are easier to sell than diamonds. Dr. Watson thinks of a circus. The Shooting Gallery is patronized by men and women. Mary recognizes the tall tattooed man. Will anything happen to her? Holmes is on the job. Small and his men must escape fast! The police have a fast motor boat to pursue Small's boat. Small finds the pearls hidden on Mary. Holmes and Watson defeat Small's gang. There is a happy ending for Mary and Dr. Watson. ""Elementary my dear Holmes.""

The ending was changed from the original novel, which was a more ironic ending (like ""The Maltese Falcon""). Aside from this, it is one of the best of the Holmes films. Arthur Wontner looks most like the ""Sherlock Holmes"" in the old illustrations. Ian Hunter is the best ""Doctor Watson"", a young man around thirty. Note Doyle's subtle criticism of British Imperialism and its looting of the treasures of India.",1396483200,,2754,4.625766871165644
