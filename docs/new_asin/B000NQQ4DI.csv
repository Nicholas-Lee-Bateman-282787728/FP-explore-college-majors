2777351,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I ordered this ROBIN HOOD after seeing only 2 episodes.  I don't usually do that; I usually read all the customer reviews before making up my mind to buy something.  Why did I jump in so early?  This looks like being a classic ROBIN HOOD.

The pilot and first episode are fantastic.  The pilot retells the familiar story of how Robin returns from war in the Holy Land and becomes an outlaw, and does so with wit and verve, in true swashbuckling style -- and with a beautifully light touch of humor.  If you have seen THE PRINCESS BRIDE, you have seen a similar style of humor to that used here.  But in that movie humor is a large element of its content.  It is a very small but important element in the RH pilot.

The first episode turns very gritty; and the humor becomes a much lighter, smaller element.  The Sheriff of Nottingham takes over Robin's former estate (like the terrorists took over a Russian school a few years back) and starts cutting out people's tongues -- one peasant at a time -- in an effort to make them tell him where Robin is.  Meanwhile, Robin is having his own troubles with the outlaws of Sherwood Forest, who see him as an enemy from the upper class.  This is a complex story with complex people and very believable motivations.

The writing is very sharp; the acting is spot on.  It is beautiful.  Do I have any complaints?  Well...  I could be a little picky and say people really didn't bathe much back then; and when the Sheriff says, ""Tick, tock, tick, tock..."" to indicate time is passing and he is getting tired of waiting for someone to tell him what he wants to know...  ordinary people didn't have mechanical clocks back then.  But, hey, this is a legend not history.  And it is superb.

I love this ROBIN HOOD.",1173571200,131,1750,4.40625
2777352,5,B000NQQ4DI,"From the BBC but shown on PBS.  Music by Clannad.  Some of the songs from Robin Hood are on a cassette by Clannad called Themes.
This series includes the God of the Wood which none of the other films or television series on Robin Hood do.  Robin Hood like other
films and television series's is the champion of the poor but here he seems to be more compassionate and socially responsible.  Writing
and acting is excellent and I watched it each week and enjoyed it very much.",1457136000,,474,4.413793103448276

2777354,3,B000NQQ4DI,"This was OK  not what I expected, but okay.  From what I heard and read about the series, it sounded like a campy version of the tale.  but it was just another re-telling.  Acting was decent and themes of war, PTSD, prejudice and injustice are threaded into the story.",1449014400,,268,4.408163265306122

2777358,4,B000NQQ4DI,"Love this series, amazing and addictive. Awesome twist on the classic and just an awesome show I still enjoy as a teen today. First watched on Netflix and fell in love with Robin of Locksley and his merry band of outlaws, ""Never forget the outlaws!"" Said by Robin in the series. 3 seasons in total and that's all were getting. More accurate to the true story of Robin Hood, with UK own twist and amazing tale of this catchy and completely worth it series.",1433635200,2,455,4.428571428571429
2777359,1,B000NQQ4DI,Really low quality. Poor acting and average script. Not worth paying for in my opinion. I guess I've been spoiled by Game of Thrones and Vikings...,1429401600,,147,4.6923076923076925
2777360,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Season 1 of Robin Hood is one of my go-to comfort treats. I must have watched it through ten times over the years.

No, it's not historically accurate- but neither is the fantastic ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn, and who cares? Yes, the show quickly begins sucking in Season 2 and is rotten by Season 3 (when your title actor wants to break out of the show, you know it's run out of steam).

But as long as you stay in the fun zone of Season 1, you get first rate derring-do, an abundance of charming performances, and come away from each episode feeling a little better about life. If you're the sort of person who's perked up by a swashbuckling yarn, Season 1 will definitely be a friend to you.

And mercifully, the season is pretty self contained. Like me, you can just pretend Robin's lighthearted adventures went on in the usual vein forever.

The finale's fist-pumping final frame pretty much sums up the whole experience. Season 1 is a huge win!",1427932800,,966,4.502857142857143
2777361,1,B000NQQ4DI,"I would rate this as a 5 star show but for the horrible choice of ending in season 2. I watched it with my 7 and 9 year old girls for the last few months and we really enjoyed it. However in the season finale of season 2, Marion, a major character and love of Robin's life, is killed. Sorry for the spoiler but in my opinion and the opinion of my daughters, it ruined the whole thing for us. Wish I'd known in the beginning so we didn't get so invested. We watch shows like this to have a little break from the normal suffering of life, not to upset us. Its a good show but the ending royally sucks and is not really in the spirit of the original legend. Bad choice on the producer's part. This show is not recommended unless you enjoy bad endings.",1427587200,,748,4.0608108108108105

2777363,3,B000NQQ4DI,"I really struggled with this series.  I started watching it primarily because Richard Armitage was in it, and I've been interested in seeing the rest of his work after his turn in the Hobbit.  I watched the series straight through on Netflix, so perhaps my opinion is affected by the fact that, when you watch the episodes in a marathon like that, you see that the plot of each episode really doesn't change much.  The acting was good, although it was fairly clear early on who was new to acting and who wasn't - Guy of Gisborne's character developed much more over the course of the series than the Sheriff, for example, who never managed to become more than one-dimensional.  But the behavior of most characters simply wasn't believeable in any context, let alone 12th century Britain.  By the end of the first season, I was seriously hoping for Marian to die simply because she irritated me so much.  It was also clear that none of the actors were given a proper backstory for their characters, and that seriously compromised the acting for the first six episodes, until they all hit their stride and got comfortable.

That said, if you can set aside the anachronisms (women in the 12th century did not ride astride a horse and certainly did not wear trousers, but nice attempt at ""equality"", guys) it's pretty entertaining.  I laughed far more often than I expected to, and though I ended up skipping about half the third season (a female sheriff is absurd, even for a show like this), I still found the final episode emotionally intense and will likely re-watch the entire series several times.  But this series is also a good example of what happens when the show's writers don't take enough time to flesh out the backstory, the characters, or where they are planning to end up with their show.  Watch it for enjoyment's sake, but just don't expect too much.

Half the time you'll feel like you're watching genuine drama, the other half you'll think you're watching a Mel Brooks film.  Be prepared.",1425081600,,2004,4.694285714285714
2777364,3,B000NQQ4DI,"I haven't seen the entire series 1 yet, but it is a very enjoyable adventure series. Keith Allen and Richard Armitage are both excellent as the Sheriff and Guy of Gisborne, respectively, exuding menace and greed without going too much over the top. Jonas Armstrong does a good job of Robin, but the best ""Merry Man"" is undoubtedly Sam Troughton as the ever loyal and whining Much. The other Merry Men have yet to have shown too much of characteristics to really know much about them. My main issue with the show is Marian and the historical inaccuracies. This can sometimes be done well, as in BBC's The Musketeers, but this is not so much the case with Robin Hood. My hope is that the series does improve as it goes on while retaining the action and action.",1424476800,4,758,4.5

2777378,5,B000NQQ4DI,Started watching this because Richard Armitage is in it but I was really surprised at how good the entire cast is. This show was so well written & casted I am on my 2nd viewing of season 1 when I decided to buy it. The plot twist & developments are really good even if they are not factual. There is one episode where a guy they find is a warrior from the holy wars but he's wearing camouflaged pants. Really??? Did not know they had  those in Sherwood forest times....Other than that it is a good series & Richard Armitage as Sir Guy is fantastic!!!

This show literally does everything in it's power to destroy the Robin Hood classic storyline.  The new ""improved"" Robin is portrayed as a pompous womanizer of low moral character, Maid Marion as a tomb raider like figure, little John as a lazy dope and Friar Tuck non existent due to the obvious politically motivated anti-religious bias that the show portrays.  It was hard to see such a timeless classic story like Robin Hood be destroyed by an over sexualized, dumbed down secular and politically motivated agenda.

No men in tights here!  Robin comes home from the war with his former servant, whom he has given his freedom for his help in the war, but the guy (Much) still is faithful, but has a big mouth and gets them into all sorts of trouble.  The sheriff of Nottingham is an evil guy, but Robin won't kill him, just threatens to here and there for a weak alliance against other bad guys.  It's not terrific, but it's different than most series so it's a relief to watch it.

Really despicable. Just have to say the only thing disappointing was the finale. I won't give it away. But I highly recommend it. Wish I could watch The Musketeers, but not available.

As with the new Sherlock, I had to kind of let go of preconceived expectations of ""Robin Hood."" So on that basis, as often happens, the good story and strong characters made it a very entertaining series. It started out a little on the bland side, but each episode improves, and the acting is wonderful. Three new faces for me (and I'm in the States, not the UK) were Jonas Armstrong, Lucy Griffiths, and Sam Troughton, who all put in an outstanding performance. Keith Allen was the really bad sheriff of Nottingham; very convincing! He definitely seems a bit unhinged! Always love Richard Armitage, and Anjali Jay was great!

2777497,3,B000NQQ4DI,"I started watching season one with high expectations.  I've loved anything Robin Hood since I was a child.  Episode  1 was well written and the main characters were introduced with flair.  I quickly moved on to episode 2 and noticed that the the story arch was continued from episode 1.  I thought I had hit jackpot series gold until I started watching other episodes.  Then the storyline became predictable episode after episode.  The wonderful care in writing and introduction of characters, with a back story was gone.  The layers and shades that was evident in the first couple of episodes that gave characters light and shade that prevented monotony and predictability were gone.  I wondered out loud what had happened...different writes, producers? Who knows?  The lead character is played by  Jonas Armstrong and I would say watch out for this young man.  He does a wonderful job of portraying a young Robin Hood.  Nuances in his performance made me smile and endeared me to the character even more.  Out of 13 episodes of series 1 I watched 9 and started watching the beginning of episode 10 but just could not continue.  If I watch the rest of the episodes or Season 2 or 3 I will update my review but as of now I don't see that happening",1405728000,,1247,4.655963302752293

2777501,3,B000NQQ4DI,"If I'd never seen any version of the Robin Hood story I might've been more impressed. However, this Robin Hood is a very ordinary man. He's short, not at all muscular, barely able to grow a beard, does everything for fame, glory and love, and except for his remarkable archery skill, isn't impressive. If not for Marian, Much and Little John, he surely would've died in one of the early episodes. (Where's Friar Tuck?) The Sheriff of Nottingham is definitely a mean person, but in this series, he's also a bit effeminate. Maid Marian, on the other hand, is more of a tomboy, and one half of her character is that of the Night Watchman. The Night Watchman behaves more like Robin Hood than he often does. I kept watching, hoping for it to get better, and it finally did with only 2 episodes left. One reason I think this series suffers is that nearly every episode in the sequence is written by someone different. On to the second season...",1405209600,,939,4.529411764705882

I have starting watching the show several times.  I can't force myself past 30 minutes.  I've even skipped episodes in hopes the first few are just rough and unpolished but no.

 Nothing against the actors but the characters are simple, shallow and way predictable.  Bad guys wear generic black, off the rack outfits.  Shooting arrows between your best friend's fingers to make an opinion point, seriously?  I feel like I'm watching a saturday cartoon ported to live action.

The actor playing Robin Hood comes across as a kid ..maybe Robin Hood's long lost cousin but definitely not the lead. He has no connection to the role at all. The gal playing his love interest is a cold snarky little thing with a fashion sense not dated for that time...did anyone in that production actually pick up a book and just glanced what they wore in that time period???
Richard Armitage has enough eye liner he could pass for a David Bowie double. I even think I saw an extra wearing a ""hoodie"" ..I mean just painful to watch...this team had BBC standing behind them and probably a nice amount of dough and this is what we're left with.

2777522,2,B000NQQ4DI,"I've been a follower of Robin Hood most of my life. The idea, the legend, has universal appeal. My first Robin Hood was Errol Flynn. The first Robin Hood I read was poetry, that is, English ballads followed by ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" by Howard Pyle. In 1991 we got two modern Robin Hood movies: ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" with Kevin Costner (and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and a knockout sound track followed by ""Robin Hood"" with Patrick Bergin (and Uma Thurman), which has become my favorite movie (but Mary Elizabeth is my favorite Marian).

So, this Robin Hood has 500 years of competition. I wanted to like it, but it always seemed more like a band of teenagers with their uncle (Little John) rather than a band of merry men. This Robin Hood is simply not believable as being a nobleman. The story lines are, on average, shallow, and in some cases, silly. In one episode, they are fearless and able warriors. In the next, they more resemble the Keystone Cops (Google it). Robin Hood is conflicted. Although the story line has the Sheriff protected, nothing is protecting Gisborne, yet Robin refuses to end him, so Gisborne is basically allowed to freely terrorize and murder the poor villagers.

The Saracen girl is no more than a nod to political correctness. The Brits are being overrun by Islam, following quickly on the heels of Sweden, so they had to include a Muslim to offset the Crusades. Equal time and all of that tripe.

I really wanted to like this Maid Marian. (Killing her off was simply stupid, but that's on Robin for allowing Gisborne to live.) She's beautiful and she can fight, except when she can't fight; She seems to be schizophrenic---strong one minute and a poor weak damsel in distress the next.

I simply cannot recommend this piece of fluff. It was asthmatic from beginning to end.",1402617600,,1832,4.715625

2777530,4,B000NQQ4DI,Enjoyed this version of Robin Hood.  We will definitely see more of the series.  Be sure to spend the time for an episode.  It should be seen from beginning to end.

2777535,3,B000NQQ4DI,"I grew up with a hero worship, on Robin Hood, the magical one with Errol Flynn. And some other TV series,
One eith Richard Greene.
This series, doesn't match those ones, but still a fun view.
On researching my Family Tree, I found out my ancestors, came to England with William the Conquerer, in 1066.
A date every Brit, remembers well.
Robin Hood was of course a Saxon Lord, and my family being Normans, were the bad guys. Oh well, we all have
Some bad sheep in our Trees,

It's easy on the violence without being G rated and has very good writers.  I was so glad to see it wasn't another one of those romance shows they seem to make adnauseum  these days where the writing is poor and  everybody is a model, 22 years or so,  and can't act - although I must say there are some very handsome young people Robin Hood.",1401235200,,474,4.053763440860215
2777540,1,B000NQQ4DI,"This series is complete tripe. The characters are poorly developed, the casting and directing dreadful, and the writing is embarrassing. Early in the show, Robin is revealed to be a bit of a rake and makes out with a man's ""daughter"" who clearly is too old for the part. Later, when four of Robin's compatriots are dangling from ropes, Robin feels compelled to issue rebellious snippets before releasing the arrows that cut the ropes holding them, the last two with one shot.

I've seen many great pistol, rifle, axe throwing and bow and arrow shots that were beyond belief; but most of the trick shots were done after extensive practice and sometimes the people making the shots would miss on occasion. Robin not only throws a sword many feet feet up in the air to hit and disable two men wearing metal helmets, the bow he uses to pull off his remarkable shots is not his bow, nor are the arrows his arrows. No one could make such shots using a bow and arrows he's never used before. Each bow has a different pull, each arrow must be made for a particular bow. And no arrow made back then was capable of slicing through a heavy rope. That no one brought up any of this during an early production meeting is even more indicative of the problems behind this peabrained series. Robin also would have used a long bow, not that ridiculous recurved bow. I could go on, but why bother? This is simply a retelling if Zorro, but not nearly as enthusiastic. If you're older than 24, pass on this garbage. It's strictly greasy kid stuff.",1401148800,,1527,4.512635379061372
2777541,1,B000NQQ4DI,"I didn't expect writing and dialect like that of Game of Thrones but this is truly an amateur production directed at, I suppose, the younger crowd that wouldn't think it odd to hear characters exclaiming ""No Way"" or ""la-tee-dah"". P l e a s e !  It might have been a bit more interesting with a little nudity, at least. It's a modern day Robin Hood that should have been placed in current day metro London.",1401062400,,405,4.328947368421052
2777542,5,B000NQQ4DI,"My son recently did a research project on Robin Hood.  We learned of how the Robin Hood legend has changed throughout the ages.  This show cleverly weaves many of the tales, both old and new, together making it fun to watch.  It also provides excellent insight into the history of England through historical fiction.  Family friendly and highly recommended.",1401062400,,357,5.0
2777543,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I've always wanted to watch something Robin Hood and was so excited to see this!
In the first episode of season 1 we meet Robin Hood with his friend Much on their way back from fighting during the war in the Holy Land. We also meet the Sheriff and Sir Guy, more men join the band as the show progresses and in each episode you learn something more about the characters that you didn't know before.

This show can be brutal at times and the sheriff in this story isn't someone fighting for justice - he's downright evil. He doesn't hesitate to throw a woman and her child in jail for not paying their taxes, or killing a man if it will help him gain power. Sir Guy helps the Sheriff a lot, though I think he can never quite make up his mind whether he wants to be the bad guy all the time or try and turn to be the good one.
Lady Marian is perfect in this show, and always how I imagined she would be. There is humor in the story at times as well which can make the dark times seem a little lighter, and Jonas Armstrong did an amazing job at betraying Robin! I love how Robin is serious at times but can also be very cheeky.
There is also lots of action and you never know what could happen next - lots of surprises happening along the way. Adventure is around pretty much every corner in this show, and there is never a dull moment!!! I am pretty much on the edge of my seat at every moment of the show. =)
This show can also be a bit contemporary at times so it gives it a little different mood, but I really like the difference! Also I love the Medieval time period and they did a very good job at betraying that!
My siblings (ages ranging 5-13) love it as well, and we all love to sit down in the evenings together and enjoy it. Wonderful and a must watch for Robin Hood fans! ",1400976000,2,1780,4.0539772727272725

2777558,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Errol Flynn over did his role as Robin Hood with absolutely too much swashbuckling, dune back then to wow the audiences which were in the Flash Gordon series of Buster Crabb.  But this version is very good, the clothing is of the period although the chain mail armour of some of the knights appears a wee bit too cloth-like.  All-in-all though, the sheriff is nasty in a sarcastic way, Gisbon relishes being brutal, there are no silly attempts to shoot to targets using two arrows from the same bow like Kevin Costner's rendition of the legendary Robin Hood.  Russell Crowe's rendition of the character is totally dispassionate where the peasants are concerned.  But Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood is.  This is definately an action-packed series, with humour, tragedy, developing friendships, and beautiful countryside scenes and authentic castles.  My only problem with this series is that as an Amazon Prime member, whilst viewing it online, each episode is cut off or disconnected after the first thirty-five minutes into each forty-five minutes session.  I doubt that you will have this problem if you purchase the HD Blue Ray set.",1398902400,,1133,5.059139784946237
2777559,4,B000NQQ4DI,This is a pretty good show it has its corney moments but has some interesting plot lines. It pretty much follows the storyline of Robin Hood with a few changes. The actors chosen for it are pretty good. Its not Emmy award winning but a nice show that the family can enjoy together. The violence is at a minimum and the stuff that is violet has been toned down and you never see any blood. Id say its ok for anyone over 8.,1398902400,,421,4.0843373493975905

Robin is rougish and sly, always able to thwart the sheriff  and Guy of Gisborn. The sheriff is evil and manipulative, leaving Sir Guy to carry out the evil deeds on the villagers. As played by Richard Armitage, Sir Guy is sinister, cruel, menacing and violent, committing violence and murder, while trying to establish a relationship with Marian, who is repelled by him and ambivalent about Robin. There is lots of violence including cutting out of tongues, breaking of legs, torture and murder. The episodes move quickly with chases, escapes,  and confrontaions.

This series appears to be designed to appeal to tweens and those that live on a steady diet of Cheetos, Mountain Dew and whose cultural apex is spending their Saturday nights playing Call of Duty on their XBox 360.

The writing was terrible and to the degree that it couldn't even be considered ""fun schlock"". The acting was equally as bad but i place that blame on the writers, director(s) and producers.

Overall, this felt like an American series that was made by people who had heard of Robin Hood yet knew nothing of the history or politics of the time. There was no attempt at authenticity, competent or compelling storytelling, instead relying on factory processed one liners and fight scenes that looked as genuine as a television preacher begging for money.",1395014400,3,867,4.735099337748345

He was clever, quick, bold, confident, optimistic, witty, mischievous, utterly charming and just HOT.  He was sizzling and really portrayed the people's champion Robin Hood so well.  The other actors weren't that bad either. The Sheriff was so brilliantly done. He was hilarious. I loved the humor and the show was always exciting to watch with the twists and turns.  Season 1 was my favorite season. I thought the last season didn't do the show justice, but the first two seasons were absolutely terrific. It's a great family show and does Robin Hood in somewhat of a light way.  Other versions of the legend, especially movie versions are always done so dark with a much too serious Robin.  This BBC TV series did it better because to be so loved, Robin had to have that charisma and it factor to make people enamored of him and follow him.  I highly recommend it.

The costumes are downright distracting -- clearly synthetic materials much of which appears to have been taken from the rack of a goth clothing store.  Marion's clothing in particular is ridiculous and clearly not of the time period or even attempting to be of the time period.

Robin Hood is a story that everybody knows throughout the US and this show really puts, what was on paper, on the screen really well. ""Steal from the rich, give to the poor.""",1393200000,,254,4.3125
2777672,4,B000NQQ4DI,"as a lover of all Robin Hood stories, I have to say this is the version I like the best. this Hood retelling is updated, but not adulterated, and somehow manages to make Robin selflessly noble and also human. as origin stories go, the first episode is unparalleled, and my insides were knotted up with anxiety at the climax, even though i knew what was going to happen-and there isn't a single anticlimax in the whole season, and in spite of being awesomely silly, the episodes also deal with some real dilemmas of loyalty and friendship, morality and passion, that make the show more than merely entertaining but also quite worthwhile.
  and now on to a few criticisms... the only bad things about the show that I could find are a few technical inconsistencies. although the dialogue is good, there are some anachronisms, and the costumes (especially Maid Marian's) sometimes look more modern than medieval. Marian's hair color is constantly changing from black to brown. and Robin Hood himself is a little skinny to look entirely heroic. however, these problems are easily overlooked when contrasted with the show as a whole, which is very good.
  and finally, a note for the sensitive viewer: except for a low neckline in the first episode and a few scenes of kissing, Robin Hood is completely clean. there are a few grisly moments, but things like torture and bloodshed are indicated, not shown. a Christian viewer might have a problem with a point in the storyline where several of the outlaws exclaim 'allah be praised!' in spite of having previously professed Christianity, but in my opinion the slight was understandable due to context.
  overall, an awesome show well worth watching. I hope this review was helpful.",1393027200,,1724,4.886986301369863

Add to the Saracen (starting with Robin Hood Prince of Thieves), that the Saracen is a woman, that Marion is the daughter of the former sheriff and also the Night Watchman.  I think that too much is made of the Marion / Gisborne romance, and a little unbelievable that a knife struck so close to the heart (Saracen attack on Robin in the Holy Land) would do so little damage.  Missing the comic relief of the good Friar Tuck, but perhaps that comes later.  It is clean viewing (so far), without having to wade through gratuitous language or immodesty.  I have liked it enough so far that I am still with the series and have added seasons 2 and 3 to my watchlist.  We'll see how it goes from there.",1392422400,,907,4.331360946745562
2777680,4,B000NQQ4DI,"Edit:  Upon completing season 2.
Season two drastically improves writing, character development, and story themes.  The humor grows, the costumes, music, sound effects all improve.  Seasons 2 and 3 seem to make the awkward beginning of season 1 worth the wait.

In the spirit of the Hercules and Xena television shows of 90's comes a relatively bland story of Robin hood.
The characters are superficial (writing, motivations, and dialogue are predictable)
Writing:  (Meh)
While it is entertaining to keep in the background, nothing about this show is a ""must watch"" or tantalizes the viewer into ""what-if"" scenarios or build's attachments to the character.  Quite possibly the only character who some depth is Sir Guy Gisborne who is at least somewhat conflicted in his motivations.
Production:  (BAD)
Cheesy sound effects and graphical representations of scene changes, (title pages with an arrow whiz sound + thump) remove any immersion in the world.  Township guards clad head to toe in face-hiding false armor removes a human facet of ""the enemy"" and results in robotic fight scenes where there is no tension or concern for these masked drones (think Starwars the phantom menace...  did you care if all those fighting droids were killed? other episodes: Storm Troopers? no...  you only cared about the people you could identify). This results in nearly all the ""fight scenes"" seeming boring though they often are fairly well done.
The sound effects and music are on a different volume level from the actual tracks...  sometimes this is good...  in this production it washes out the story completely and results in annoyance.
Acting:  Sub par...  possibly not the actors fault, poor directing or poor writing could easily be the culprit here...  again shallow characters make an actors job difficult.  Poor direction added to this can make it impossible.  Once again, think Hercules or Xena of the 90's but there was some good acting in those shows, but much of the mistakes were covered by fun magic and anecdotes surrounding the mythos of the two characters and their journey...  this show has no ""magic"" and as such falls flat on believable story and or character motivations.

Summary:  It is a good show when absolutely nothing else is on and you don't wish to think but merely ""be entertained""
Not a show for binge watching...  there is nothing to make you absolutely ""HAVE"" to watch the next episode 2.5 out of 5 stars I don't hate it but don't like it enough that I would watch a second running of it.",1392422400,,2512,4.947494033412887

Groaning with cliched characters, fight sequences that would draw chuckles at a little theater production, and immaculately clean peasant maidens who look up from their poverty in modern cosmetics, Robin Hood is a surprisingly awful production from people who should know better. Monty Python period sketches feature better costuming, and their laughs, at least, are intentional. ""Robin Hood"" lurches from one anachronistic clinker to the next, strung together by predictable plotlines and the least merry Merry Men of all time. I suppose the series producers can take some satisfaction in making Kevin Costner's dismal ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" look positively coherent by comparison.",1390608000,4,743,5.584070796460177

In the three seasons that I've watched I can only remember one episode with a few cuss words.... damn, damn, damn!  By a woman, no less.  There is no sexual impurity and in fact, modesty is actually a virtue.  There is love and romance at it's finest.  Always a battle against evil and evil never winning out in the end.

The actors are great!  Marian is beautiful.  The evil Guy is handsome and one wonders if Marian can win him to the good side during the first two seasons.  Robin Hood is handsome as well, somewhat skinny, but quick and an expert with the bow and arrow.  The arrow shooting sounds heard at each interval of each episode are a bit unnerving at first, because you always think someone has really shot an arrow.  It takes a while to get use to that.  But, It is fun to see the expertise of Robin's use of the bow and arrow.

However, it was still fun to watch.

Joe Armstrong is amazing as the supporting character Alan A Dale, but then he also completely stole the show as Hotspur in Shakespeare's Henry the IV - big time - in the Hollow Crown series on PBS.  He is the best actor I have ever seen actually, so that is why I.wanted to watch this old series, that I had missed- to see if this was the case in other productions as well and if he is  always was such an amazing performer - the answer is - yes.

Robin Hood has been the subject of many films. and videos and I have seen most of them.  He is such an appealing character that I am sure there will be many more.

The characterization of the Sheriff is the best i have seen, though I doubt that, in reality, the man would have gotten away with being as anti-church in that time period. Guy of Gisborn is  extremely well portrayed, and his multiple internal conflicts make him someone to watch throughout the series. I withheld a fifth star because Robin and company come across as a bit too 21st century in their ideals. A Robin who limits himself to occasionally tonking someone on the head is a bit of a reach. It is also difficult to imagine a band of men enjoying life in the Sherwood with nothing more than a cave for shelter, and then only when it is raining. Really? In England? I should think the cave would be well furnished from near-continuous use!

The topics touched on range from class warfare to PTSD of the warriors returning from the holy land. The story is told while trying to take the moral high ground and the recurring problems of not resorting to the enemy's methods.

The darkness of the story is offset by some campy comedy included in the quirks of different characters.

It is best to be watched without a preconceived expectation of how the story should unfold.

SPOILER ALERT !!!!!

The telling of this story varies from the classic rendition on several significant parts. Friar Tuck does not show up until the 3rd season. Maid Marian does not survive into the 3rd season.

2777784,1,B000NQQ4DI,"This is a politically correct re-writing of the Robin Hood legend. Maid Marian is a Robin Hood in skirts. She dons masculine costume, is an excellent fighter and swords-woman, and fights men with great success. She seems more masculine than Robin Hood, but is also a beautiful, sexy woman. Not with her father, however. She insults him because he cannot understand her interest in fighting and leading rebellion against the Sheriff of Nottingham. He is a wimp, who gives in to her every time, like her would-be lover, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, who cannot take rejection and mopes around giving her gifts. The male Robin Hood is an acrobatic buffoon, who doesn't know how to deal with his serious beloved, and also cannot understand her. She treats him like dirt, and he loves it. His costume is invented 19th century, as are all the men, who apparently refused to wear tights, but this is 1192. England is populated by about 10% Africans, so it seems, only some of whom are Muslims from the Holy Land, and the Christian English seek to operate a slave-labor camp. The Crusades, in the interpretation fostered by enemies of Christendom 100 years ago, were wicked and imperialistic. The actual current historical opinion is more balanced. See the movie Kingdom of Heaven. The Sheriff, an idiot who wears only black pajamas, tries to be a Mel Brooks. He, not Prince John, is inexplicably the most powerful man in the Kingdom, who plotted alone to kill King Richard at Acre. Most of the stories in the series, filmed in Hungary, are politically correct visions of today, set in 1192. Robin Hood actually marries two peasants in the forest because Friar Tuck has not yet appeared. But, oops, he is a good cleric, and probably one could not bear to find a believing Christian with a good heart.

It's one of those shows that is very obviously driven by the plot outline, and the characters were more cardboard cutouts that did the stuff they were supposed to. There was a very strong pacifist streak, in that rarely were even the nondescript, generic soldiers killed. Robin was full of generic idealism, just like the character brief would say; Marian was a feisty, independent love-interest, just like the character brief would say; Muck is a stomach-driven, sometimes-coward and is typically a foil for comic relief, just like the character brief would say; etc, etc, etc.

2777798,3,B000NQQ4DI,"This is a very different Robin Hood and somewhat entertaining, but was hard to get 'lost' in; my mind kept wondering which is not a good sign.  Robin Hood is too young and boyish.  There are too many propaganda messages, e.g. Muslim's depicted as good, clever & noble, but Christians as otherwise, or silly. Someone did not study their history nor what sparked the reason for the crusades.  Hello...the Turks converted largely by the edge of sword and killed many many innocents as well; so that bit of propaganda was a turn off.  Obviously the Producers are aiming to appeal to a certain demographic; so much of the show comes off as contrived, which some may find distracting, at least I did and it reminded me why I stopped watching TV many years ago, thus the Amazon customer that I am.

Miriam was barely tolerable.  However, the Sheriff is perfectly cast. I enjoyed the Turk girl character disguised as a boy, she's very likable.  I was not crazy for Richard A playing evil. I think he may have been better cast as Robin Hood, but then some of the others would have needed to be a few years older.",1381190400,,1103,4.5125628140703515
2777799,5,B000NQQ4DI,"First heard about this series through a fan-fiction writing site. Having been a long time fan of Robin Hood enjoyed the stories people wrote, and looked it up. (Live in the U.S. and it doesn't come on tv here.)

Only seen the first couple episodes so far, and loving every bit of it. The characters are so colorful, that they draw you in. Robin is everything anyone could want in a hero. Cute, witty, resourceful, daring, doing what's right even though it's not politically correct, etc. He has his moments of arrogance, that 'wanting to be loved', but who doesn't? Marian is both charming, and like Robin, dares to do everything she can to help others, even if it means putting herself in danger. I like the fact she's got real character and not some flimsy maiden in distress. Much certainly lives up to his name by adding much to the show. He and Allan a'Dale are hilarious to watch, and while they seem similar, Much has more of a presence, while Alan has a subtle spontaneity. Guy of Gisborne is so handsome i kinda wish he'd turn around and leave the sheriff to do his own dirty work. The Sheriff is so dastardly evil and ruthless, it's sickening, yet sometimes humorous in a dark way. He is truly a character all his own, and not a bumbling idiot controlled by Prince John, as portrayed in other versions. (Where is Prince John anyways? why is the Sheriff holed up in the castle of Nottingham without him. Yes, he was sent by John, but it's like he replaces him.)

I like the fact that the fight scenes/kill shots are tastefully done so you see alot without seeing much. You get the picture when someone is being killed, yet they don't include gore and blood. Even when there's a stabbing, and the Sheriff or Gisborne kill someone and they pull their sword back, there's never any blood on it. I think the producers were going for more of a family-comedy idea for the show, as it also lacks harsh language.

Seems like every episode has a Robin vs. the Sheriff moment, which makes for it being repetitive, although you can't help wondering when one will end up killing the other.

Where is Friar Tuck? At first i thought it was him in the first episode when he was saying that the men to be hanged had repented, etc. and were 'novice novices', but turns out that was only the jailer in disguise. kind of a letdown.

Still, amidst it's repetitive moments, (what tv series isn't repetitive in it's idea of hero nabs/outwits bad guy, detective solves murder case, ie, why always a murder case?) historically inaccurate apparel, it has lighthearted spirit, mixed with grim realism, adventure and romance, all while being family friendly. 5 stars all the way.

Sad this series was cut short, although i hear it's because they killed off Marian. Some fan written stories based on this particular series kill Robin Hood, so it makes me wonder if they killed him later on, as well. Not cool. That's the #1 way to end a tv show, and also make your fans start getting all sorts of irate. Unless, maybe the producers were just getting bored, or some of the actors got contracts to do other shows, etc. Still, would be nice if they'd think about the fans a little bit.. :/

Anyways, hope i haven't ruined it for some of you, think of it as a kind way of preparation. Make it less sad and distraughting. Yeah, okay, not working. i get it. ;) A+ all the way.",1381017600,,3351,4.4926108374384235

2777855,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Even though I am a fan of every rendition of Robin Hood----ordinary people taking back from and resisting oppressive government and returning the taxes to the hard working people who pay them, I watched this for Gisborne more than for Robin Hood.

The first episode, ""Will You Tolerate This?""  sets theme, and Robin's speech in the last episode of the  third season is as inspirational as the first episode.  I would have liked to see the show go on for several more seasons.

But Guy of Gisborne is the most interesting character in this series.  (Far better the whining incompetent Guy of Robin of Sherwood.)  The conflict between Robin and Giy is set well in the first episode without violence.

Richard Armitage does a great job of portraying Gisborne as an ambitious but tormented man who fights on the wrong side but who still has some salvageable aspects to his character.  He mistakenly thinks that acquiring power and position will give him what he wants in life, though that  mindset is constantly challenged by Robin and Marian living the truth that it is not power, but selfless commitment to serving a greater cause brings happiness, respect and love.  He is always subtly struggling between what he thinks he must do to further his ambition and being the kind of man he should be.

Consequently, Gisborne has the most depth and intriguing aspects of any character in the series.  So much so that I had to look up his background to find out more about him.  He would have been my choice physically for Faramir in The Lord of the Rings or for the character range of Boromir. Gisborne's scenes are the strong point of each episode because while he is the military arm of the irrational and sometimes campy Sheriff (who has NO redeeming qualities),  there are always indications that when his ambitions don't get in the way, he has some heart for the ordinary people even if his concept of  law enforcement is rather brutal.

Even if you're not a fan of Robin Hood (but who isn't), watch this for the development of the dark and brooding Gisborne, always compelling in black leather.",1376006400,4,2093,4.706043956043956

2777880,5,B000NQQ4DI,"BBC family shows tend to follow the same outline:  the first season is generally full of the same plot lines and have cheesy characters.  I don't know why that is - maybe the BBC only gives a little bit of money to start the show, see how it does, then by the 2nd series finally gives the show some money to hire real writers.  Just a guess.  So the thing is, you have to get past the 1st series.  I learned this when getting into Merlin - I was home ill for a week and put it on Netflix to kill the time.  I thought the 1st series was rubbish but was too weak to find another show in my feavered state.  By the 2nd series I was hooked, sick or no.  Luckily they were sill making Merlin when I discovered it.  I was not so lucky with Robin Hood - it's been off the air for several years now.  But YAY of Amazon Prime for still having it!  I've been watching it and am totally addicted.  Yeah, the 1st series was kind of rubbish - like Mcdonalds for your eyeballs, but I just knew if I pushed thru it would get good - I mean, the dude that plays the 1st Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously evil.  He plays that character so well and completely sold the show to me from episode 1, even with the rubbish writing going on around him.  My next favorite is Guy of Gisborn - I just knew they would be doing things with his character that would be astounding - and they pulled everything off thanks to the superior acting of Richard Armatage.  I when into laughing hysterics with his ""So, where do I sleep?"" line in series 3.  The dude that plays Alan is freakin awesome too - his line delivery feels like a real person talking to you, and he did a spectacular job playing both sides in series 2.  But lastly, lets not forget Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood.  Series one he obviously got the role because of his charm, wit and boyishly good looks and he relied heavily upon that in the beginning - but who knew the dude could actually act???  I think the 1st episode of the 3rd series is my favorite - I really believed his pain.  My only real gripe is the scramble to give him a love interest.  I really could have done without Kate and wish they would have had her go with Much or Alan.  Anyway. I'm glad the show ended as it did without trying to carry on with a new cast.  That's what killed Being Human!  Anyway, it was a great show and I'm glad to see the mains going off and having extremely successful careers (see: The Hobbit).",1373587200,,2426,4.134615384615385

2777886,5,B000NQQ4DI,"It's kinda strange that I like this show so well, but when I start watching it I can't stop. I think the story is very compelling, especially season 1. Lucy Griffiths, who plays Marian does an outstanding job expressing emotion. I think what really makes the show so great is the character of Robin Hood and the twist they gave him in particular in this series. The writers made Robin a soldier returning from the crusades who fought alongside Richard the Lionheart in the king's guard, so there is a lot of story to be added from characters who knew him from the Holy Land. It is a different twist on the folk hero and Jonas Armstrong was excellent for the part.

The only thing I don't like about this series is there is quite a lack of realism, but it's not an HBO series. For example, it just seems like Robin and his gang can sneak in to the castle at any time and almost always escape no problem. It seems like a cartoon at times or a children's series. The fighting is a bit slow and not convincing. There isn't anything graphic as you can gather from the ratings which I didn't check, but there isn't any blood. (I'm not in to gore, I just like to be convinced).

With that being said, as mentioned before I was hooked and I really don't get in to TV much, so I had to give it 5 stars. It is a good hearted, socially moral story you can watch with the family. If you like the classic folk hero of Robin Hood helping the needy and fighting the power, you'll like this.",1372636800,,1475,4.226950354609929

But, overall it is a compelling story with likable characters. It is a shame that there is only 3 seasons, 13 episodes each season.

If you liked Hercules or Xena, this is better. Robin Hood has a reason for being there and a goal. There are a few characters that have some depth and they build it along the way.

Not so crazy about the actor playing the lead character--the stunts are well done so that he appears to be good with acrobatics and bow skills. He always looks dirty, the beard growth on his neck is gross, but then they're camping all the time aren't they? The interesting thing about this series is that you continually question the motives of both Robin and Sir Guy, who are conflicted in many ways and aren't either purely good or purely bad. I like that. The Sheriff, however, is quite dreadful. That must have been a fun part to play. Marian is also a character who gives mixed signals in her loyalty to Robin and her attraction to Guy. Her motives to help the poor are not 100% honorable. She loves the danger and the action. I'm watching series 2 now.",1367107200,,874,4.434782608695652

the while trying to be funny. Well, here is the scene of Robin Hood at amateur night, high school drama class and drunken night out at the pub.

Involuntarily, this series evicts more laughter in the viewer than intended, but the show is that bad. While a couple of roles seem to be staffed by regular actors, the majority of the roles are more inclined to be filled by people who belong to amateur night around the corner. I watched the episodes, in part because I wanted to see whether the series could get any worse, but then also for the comic relief it offered.
So if you want to see some Robin Hood, get the Errol Flynn version at your local library for free. This is like a teenage writer's first attempt at a dramatic screenplay, enacted by the bunch of blokes from the neighborhood, some of whom seem to be putting in so little effort that I would not surprised if their mind was more on the beer promised in exchange for spending a couple of hours running through the local greenery and doing their best attempt not to be violate the legend of Robin Hood any more than necessary.",1366675200,4,1205,4.308370044052864

The sheriff is nastier than ever.  Robin is daring.  His relationship with Marion is frustratingly enjoyable (sounds a bit oximoronic but it's how I feel).  I love the last minute salvations from dire cirsumstances.  All this without major blood and guts splattered and sex in your face stuff is great.  The character developments are a nice touch.  I seem to be enjoying the depth of characters more these days and this series is reaching that.  As much as I want to see the Sheriff and Gisborn get theirs.

2777988,5,B000NQQ4DI,This version of Robin hood gives a great justification of Robin's turn to stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Also a more gruesome plot with implications of tongues being cut and people being hung but not in a graphic way that it is still safe for commercial viewing. Loved Lady Marion in this version as she is quick-witted and actually more shrewd than Robin in her actions. An interesting take with much action. The plot is not complex but fun as entertainment and good scripting. This is an excellent movie in my opinion.,1363305600,,536,4.59375

2777994,2,B000NQQ4DI,"To begin with, 'Robin Hood' is poorly cast and is not the least bit convincing. Overall, the acting is mediocre at best and you expect to see someone prompting the actors regarding their lines from the side. It is awkward and amateurish at best. The costumes look like someone went into the local thrift shop and then stayed up all night sewing them together. Completely unbelievable with pieces of current things thrown in from time to time that shock you. Robin Hood's cowl looks like a hoodie from Walmart. The scenery is poorly done as well. It looks like a play any local high school would stage. Very low budget. Story themes are awkward and disjointed and poorly written. I was very disappointed because I do love the Robin Hood genre but that being said, I just couldn't continue watching this series. Bad.",1362614400,,814,4.699300699300699

The writing is hardly original, but the acting is superb and the story comes alive. You will cheer for Robin, Marion, and the peasants.

This is also a 'safe' telling of the tale for younger children. While there is violence in any telling of Robin Hood, it is kept to a fair minimum and the onscreen appearances are not gruesome or nightmare-inducing.

Overall, this is good family entertainment. Enjoy!",1362614400,,569,4.855670103092783

Three ""seasons"" were not enough, it just kept me wanting more.  I'm glad that it ended on such a bittersweet note, because heroes aren't meant to outlive us, they're meant to bring out the legends.  Jonas Armstrong was such a keen actor to play the lead; and Richard Armitage as Guy of Gisborne was just plain cool.  I loved Keith Allen's portrayal of the Sherrif of Nottingham...you just wanted to hate him...which meant he did a splendid job on his role.  All in all, a good show to watch.

From the lace up boots (and all the other really bad costumes) to the makeup-plastered-on generic wench, just really poorly done.

There did seem to be a bit of good repport between Robin and his man servant in the 10 minutes that I did watch, and from that I thought the acting might not be too terrible, but then I saw the fight scene with the wench's father, and I knew what I would have to slog through in order to see the few gems.

2778033,2,B000NQQ4DI,"First off, this is not presented as a comprehensive review of the series, since I never finished the first episode.  Made if half-way through before I cut my losses and moved on.  Robin is presented as a very young, somewhat attractive anglo male who is presented (predictably and  unsuccessfully, in my opinion) as a likeable rascal who, in addition to being the best archer in the forest, is irresistible to women.  During the first 20 minutes, he meets up with a stunning babe (who is also blonde) who lives in a small hamlet with her widowed father. After an embarrassingly long make-out scene with her, which occurs behind her father's back Robin's sidekick (forgot his name) tries to distract him, the father turns around, sees the face-sucking and butt-grabbing (I'm serious) draws his sword and a predictable sword fight ensues (during which Robin yields a curved Turkish saber). Of course, Robin escapes, since he is also an accomplished sabre warrior, by doing a back flip off the second floor of the father's house/barn, and he then escapes into the woods with his buddy (so now we can add athlete/gymnast to his resume of skills). Quite disappointing.  I have no idea if the series gets better, but the first impression was not good.",1355011200,2,1245,4.85377358490566

It is incredibly campy but wonderful. I've seen the first two episodes and don't remember hearing any foul language. There is light inuendo but nothing serious enough to turn this into something other than very family freindly in my opinion. I'm waiting for them to throw the Holy Hand Grenade at any moment. I've only seen the first two episodes and can only speak for them. If anything just watch a few episodes and you'll be entertained for a short while.

2778045,2,B000NQQ4DI,"This review is based on the first 5.5 episodes.

The show has a lot of merit.  The acting is superb, the pacing too.  The writers keep you on your toes by defying the usual conventions.  The evil characters are unabashedly selfish and whimsical, shedding the buffoonery stereotypes normally associated with them in jolly old England.  And, for the most part, I enjoyed seeing 21st-century 'liberated' character types prancing about under 12th-century technology.

Unfortunately, I find, for the serious Christian, this show is morally offensive.  Religious fervor or concern is not only absent from the characters' motivations; it is routinely mocked.  The writers practically equate the Muslim faith with Christianity in Episode 5, but succeed in making clear that belief in either is superstitious nonsense.  The Church has all the old stereotypes of fat abbot and impious prior, without any of the endearing God-fearing charm of the heroes.  Episode 6 sees the evil Sheriff openly mock a religious sister and flaunt what her cloth stands for, only for the nun to be more careful of maintaining her witty mask then to be truly angry, offended, or concerned.

I could have forgiven an agnostic series (despite not being authentic for the time), but I cannot forgive an openly hostile one.  It's a shame, since there was no need to stir up the rhetoric to the pitch it created.",1330473600,2,1377,5.04424778761062

2778048,5,B000NQQ4DI,"If you didn't think that one more Robin Hood incarnation could possibly hold its own against the long series of productions over the past decades, here's the proof that it indeed can--and HAS--been done. This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.

You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.

The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.

Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass, and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging.

 But the superb cast and characters can't help but draw you in and keep you entertained. Not to mention, easy on the eyes. The shows take on Robin Hood being a wry charmer with a bow legged swagger instead of the usual square jawed rugged hero was an interesting choice that paid off. And Guy of Gisborn was strangely sympathetic and so well played that when I found out the actor had gone on to M-I 5, I started watching that show as well.

2778061,1,B000NQQ4DI,"I've watched seven episodes of Series 1 thus far, and now ask myself ""Where's the beef?"" The BBC has a good reputation for putting out quality television programming, but this series fall flat for me.

I'm a lifelong `Robin Hood' fan--most series in the past have typically been filled with equal shares of good and evil; kindness and cruelty; bravado, derring-do, romance, intrigue, and loads of action.

Errol Flynn was one of the original Robin Hood's and, in many ways, set the standard (although Russell Crowe did a pretty good job a few years back). The one common characteristic of all of the Robin Hood characters is that they can shoot an arrow like no one else. They typically have that `pick off a fly at a hundred yards' accuracy.

This BBC series has its own interesting depictions of good (in the form of Robin, Marion, and Robin's interesting band of men and women), and evil (in the form of the nasty Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisborne). These two latter creeps have little compunction about killing, terrorizing, and stealing from the local (largely poor) citizenry.

Here's my main complaint: During the first seven episodes, Robin has had AT LEAST 10 GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES TO KILL ONE OR BOTH OF THESE EVIL-DOERS, yet has refrained from the act, only to let these two continue their terrorizing and murderous ways. It's not like Robin and his men won't kill, because others (mostly faceless castle guards and peasants) do get killed along the way, either directly or indirectly.

Watching the series has become somewhat painful, because the same syndrome becomes repeated over and over: The Sherriff dreams up some scheme to capture Robin; the Sherriff exhibits some despicable behavior to show that he hasn't let up on his evil ways; one of Robin's men gets captured; Robin and his men break into the castle; the Sheriff and his soldiers confront Robin and his men; Robin had a golden chance to do some killing one or both of the major evil-doers; there's a chase scene; Robin and his men cleverly escape (usually through the toilet chute); someone may or may not gets killed along the way (except for the Sherriff, Guy of Gisborne, Marion, or Robin--all of whom seem to be protected by angels (or iron-clad acting contracts)).

So one might draw any of the following conclusions:

1. The series writers were in major love with their main characters and wouldn't kill them off, no matter what--even if their storyline would have been much more plausible and enjoyable. It's not as if they were keeping the main characters alive to remain true to the story, because they have veered from previous telling of the story in major ways.

2. Robin has a mental illness, and won't kill evil doers, even if it means that many others will suffer from his reticence to kill them. This makes him look weak and pathetic--certainly not the person to be leading a revolution (i.e., constantly putting his comrades in needless danger, by not killing when he has the chance).

3. Robin may be secretly in love with the Sherriff, in a kind of sadomasochistic way. Robin's behavior in the series thus far allows for this possibility.

My complaint is not with the series actors, who all do a fine job of their roles. The problem seems to be with the script writing. The stories are repetitive in nature, and the characters--particularly the Sherriff--are parodies of how they have been depicted in other similar series. The series itself is starting to look and feel more and more like the old `Batman' series of the late 1960s--a real spoof of the original story. The Sherriff comes across as a cross between the `Riddler' and the `Penguin'--snappy answers to every problem, and just plain weird behavior demonstrated (e.g., a constant penchant for painting his toenails black)... Again, there are some serious plausibility issues here.

One suggestion to improve the series: As long as others are being killed off at regular intervals throughout the series (including Robin's men), kill off the evil doers themselves at regular intervals (whenever Robin has the chance), and keep replacing them with other types of evil doers.",1310947200,5,4136,4.885877318116976

The first few episodes you can tell that the actress playing Maid Marian is still trying to get comfortable in her character/interacting with the other characters, but by the middle or end of the first season she had it down great.  I think it was fun to see a little bit of the classic Robin Hood stuff mixed with the new ideas.  After watching the first season I saw a feature on the making of Robin Hood.  They explained why their costumes are not true to era, they were trying to make this a family show that kids and teenagers would enjoy watching with their parents.

2778082,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I'll admit, I became interested in this show simply because it is entitled ""Robin Hood"" and I really can't get enough of that character. I was not sure of what to expect when I popped the first disc into the player, I just crossed my fingers that it would be decent and worthwhile, especially since my wife really wanted to watch it and it would have been brutal to watch a full show that I didn't like. I consider myself very fortunate that this show exceeded my expectations, hence the five star rating.

The first thing I noticed is that the show has an interesting and unique balance of action, humor and seriousness. The scripting for the characters makes them likeable. My favorites are Robin Hood himself but also Djaq, Much, Sir Guy, and Marion. Actually, Sir Guy is easy to feel sorry for. Being the Nodingham's second in command, he is loyal to a rotten villain, but he reveals that he has a humanity to him that causes a lot of internal conflict. Marion in this story is really tough, far from the helpless damsel-in-distress that she is portrayed as in other renditions of Robin Hood. Much is definitely primarily comic relief and he handles this role well.

The Sheriff is the villain that you love to hate. He extremely smug and completely without a soul. Sometimes you want to laugh at what he says, other times you just want to jump into the screen and choke him.

I definitely recommend this show to any fans of Robin Hood. There is plenty of action to keep you on your toes but there are also the funny parts and there are some sad times thrown in as well.",1291507200,,1574,4.458333333333333
2778083,5,B000NQQ4DI,"This is Robin Hood like you've never seen it before.  As my 14-year old son said, ""This isn't really the story of Robin Hood, and it's not very medieval, but who cares?  It's so much fun!""  My family (three teenaged sons) and I loved every moment.  Fast-paced action sequences, unbelievable stunt moves, stunning music, likable characters with an incredible depth, outstanding acting, villains you love to hate (and kind of can't help liking).  What more could one want?

Jaded and disillusioned by war (the Crusades), Robin returns home to fight for justice for the peasants, to support the absent King Richard, and to avoid violence and killing as much as possible (still, lots of folks do get shot with arrows or killed with swords).  Supposedly set in the 12th century, the story and characters are thoroughly modern in all of their outlooks (all of the women characters are very 21st century), so don't look here for a history lesson.

For an action series, the series has a surprising depth and beauty.  Each episode furnished us with hours of material for discussion as we analyzed, predicted, and philosophized about every character's motives and probable next action.  The acting is absolutely outstanding.  Even characters who vacillate and change sides are thoroughly believable and consistent.",1288396800,,1305,5.1084905660377355

2778085,1,B000NQQ4DI,"When this series first aired, I thought the producers would capture some of the emotive essence of the original tales.  Sadly I was wrong.  The casting is almost completely inappropriate, with youngsters of the wrong character (for the tales) coupled with banal scripting, make this a complete turn-off, although it has to be said that some of the photography and screenplay is worthy of a look.
If you are looking for a good retelling of the Robin Hood legends, the best by a country mile is the series ""Robin of Sherwood"".  Although that one was made in the 80s? the characterisation, screenplay and script of the Carpenter production make it stand out as being way ahead of all the others.
Don't waste your money on this Robin Hood series.",1282003200,3,742,4.736434108527132
2778086,4,B000NQQ4DI,"I bought and watched all three seasons of this show.  In my opinion, this is the best of the three.  They get progressively worse unfortunately.  Being a TV series, historical accuracy is of course not a major concern here.  The storyline is surprisingly solid, character development is good, as is the acting.  There is only one particularly cheesy moment in the series that stands out.  In one episode, Robin Hood and his band deal with an English soldier fresh off the battlefield, and suffering severe PTSD. Props there.  PTSD by one name or other is certainly a timeless affliction soldiers have had to deal with.  The cheesy part is that the soldier is wearing MODERN-DAY camo pants and combat boots throughout the show. I mean, I realize that the show's producers tried to make the costumes a bit modernized to make them look a bit ""cooler"" but still...  Anyway, I was also pleased to see that this show, unlike many series, does not fall into the trap of using the same exact plot line for each episode. (ie Smallville's freak-of-the-week problem from its first couple seasons)
Nearly all the familiar cast is here; Little John, Alan a'Dale, Will Scarlett, and Marian. Noticeably absent is Friar Tuck, who for some reason does not appear in the series until Season 3.  Opposing Robin Hood is the Sheriff, Guy of Gisbourne, and uncountable henchmen.  Prince John also comes into play, but not physically so until Season 3.  All in all I would say Season 1 is well worth watching.",1278374400,,1486,4.76171875
2778087,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I was lucky to discover this on netflix and just love it!  it's a modern tongue-in-cheek yet traditional retelling (no disrespect to Errol Flynn, Mel Brooks, et al) that shows how anachronistic dialog can be fun.  Costumes and customs are as authentic as need be, the brief battle scenes rely on one's childlike suspension of belief, and the Sheriff of Nottingham is one quirky dude.  it's good fun, not intended to be an epic like Russell Crowe's forthcoming.",1277164800,,460,4.871794871794871
2778088,1,B000NQQ4DI,Graphics and story line are low budget and the show is hardly worth watching.  No where near the caliber of other BBC films.  A real disappointment,1276646400,,147,4.615384615384615
2778089,4,B000NQQ4DI,"Like most of you, I watched this show simply because Richard Armitage is in it.  And he does NOT disappoint.  All of his scenes with Marian are thrilling; they make this show worth watching.

Having said that, the series itself is, well, hilarious.  I HOPE they're trying to make it campy, because that's how it comes across; it's as though they're all in on the joke.  How could ANYONE take this show seriously?  Flimsy plots, recycled sets, overacting, poor dialogue, ridiculous costumes, and a major case of Political Correctness disease (which, as we all know, was a killer in the 1100s).  It's a lot of fun, although if you don't find it funny you might find it annoying.  But some people thought Ed Wood was a serious director, too.

And I know it's a little thing, but I don't get the cover art; it makes Robin Hood look like, well, maybe a monk?  It's like he's some dark character, which he's not; on the contrary, the actor playing him seems like a goofy 12-year-old, while Marian seems 20; that's why they never seem to belong together.  Marian's scenes with Guy crackle; her scenes with Robin just make me wanna barf.  I don't get how she could fall for him, and she doesn't seem to get it either.

I liked this season, but then I watched it for free from the library; I don't think I'd pay money for it.",1275264000,,1316,4.456066945606694
2778090,5,B000NQQ4DI,I love the story of Robin Hood. Jonas Armstrong and Lucy Griffith make this series amazing as Robin Hood and Marian add in Richard Armitarge as Sir Guy and the combination is intense and makes you feel as if you are there. These three actors/actresses put together make you have feelings and empathize with each one. The story is young and fresh and put on a new twist while staying true to the original story for the most part. The first two seasons are great the third season is okay b/c of the ending in the second season. Highly recommend it to anyone who is a Robin Hood Fan.,1274054400,,580,4.330275229357798
2778091,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood and every few years a new show or movie comes out to tell his tale. I for one, have always thought of him as the mythical man who made all the ladies swoon and never really thought of him as having a ""real"" life - season 1 has really changed my mind!

In this series, Robin Hood is played by Jonas Armstrong, and he definitely has the cute factor I have always envisioned. In comparison with the upcoming Robin Hood film starring Russell Crowe, I think that Jonas has more of the look I have attributed to this hero. In fact, every actor was perfectly cast in their roles - not only for looks, but for personality as well. Before this show I didn't know the names of anyone in his band except Robin and Little John - but now I know Allan-A-Dale and Will Scarlet. And the sheriff is wonderfully awful! Robin and Marion had great chemistry and they were great to watch together in their scenes. I don't know if I can pick my favorite character - it's a really close call between Robin and Allan.

One of the things that first struck me every time I watched an episode was how everything has a tint of green and it gives it such a brilliant look. It makes the forest look more magical. I also liked how the theme song was used throughout the episodes - something to connect with and carry through the episode.

My biggest complaint with the show is the costuming of Marion. I envision beautiful dresses befitting her rank - but much of the time she is wearing pants. While watching one of the special features they explained how this was done on purpose to make it more contemporary - but...I wished they had not done so. It just felt out of place for me because the rest of the cast looked appropriate. I loved watching this show, but it sometimes felt very slow; you would watch 2 episodes and feel like nothing had happened.

Another thing that I learned from this season was that Robin Hood had been to fight in the Crusades. Like I said before, I never thought of him as anything other than the hero. It was nice to learn some back story about how he became who he was. I cannot wait to watch season 2!",1272412800,,2143,4.297029702970297
2778092,3,B000NQQ4DI,"What an odd little show.  They've chosen the actors well, mingling the adventure of Robin Hood with some well-timed humor, especially in their villains.  They clearly have some script authors who are better than others.  Compare, for example, episode 10, ""Peace? Off!"" with episode 11, ""Dead Man Walking.""  While 10's theme had plenty of places to go, its execution turned into the ridiculous, undermining its message.  11 took the theme and ran with it, developing characters logically with a script that allowed the characters a new depth.  That dichotomy is pretty typical for the show.  On the bright side, even when the plot lines strain believability to the max, these actors carry off making it fun and entertaining.  Kudos to them all.  One final criticism, borrowed from our good sheriff:  A clue--costuming.",1267315200,,817,5.121212121212121

It has everything to make an entertaining tale.... vivid action scenes, humor, the slowly progressing love interest between Robin (Jonas Armstrong) and Marian (Lucy Griffiths), with Sir Guy of Gisborne (Richard Armitage) always trying to win Marian's affections, and of course, the diabolical Sheriff of Nottingham (Keith Allen) with a never-ending supply of evil schemes to foil our hero! Lots of sword fights with rousing music, and great sets which take you back in time. Being a weekly series gave the writers the ability to put in more details, and stretch out the plots - sort of like a soap opera! You have time to really get to know the characters. Having the entire set is a plus, because if you so choose, and have that much time, you can watch the whole thing -- commercial free! My 11-yr-old grandson watched it with me, and was so excited when I bought season two! Even though there are lots of fights and some people dying, they do not show any ""blood and guts"" (as most of the movies today are so intent on showing for reality's sake!) so I was comfortable with my grandson seeing this series. It is a very entertaining show, and I highly recommend it to everyone.

2778106,3,B000NQQ4DI,"This is an enjoyable series, with ample visually pleasing settings, costumes, and slickly choreographed swashbuckling to provide many hours of light entertainment.  It is, however, far from being a masterpiece, chiefly on account of mediocre writing and actors struggling valiantly - but not always successfully - to make the extremely implausible plausible.

The series takes substantial liberties with the traditional storyline, being heavily modernized with characters' speech, mannerisms, and attitudes reflecting 21st century norms rather than those of the Middle Ages.  This Robin Hood is politically correct and a pacifist.  In this series, there is no discrimination: children, women, people of all ages, shades of color, and lifestyle choices are represented.  I haven't yet seen a transgender character, but will not be surprised if I eventually find one in this series.  In scenes reminiscent of the old 1980's A-Team, arrows fly by the hundreds, yet miraculously, no is ever harmed, at least not by the virtuous Robin Hood or his band of merry men, women, and children.  No matter how thoroughly evil the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisbourne may be, no matter how many times Robin foils another of their plots and has them in his power, he is far too good a man to ever exploit the situation and unfailingly lets them go on to commit future crimes with a wave, a wink, and a cheery smile.  One sometimes wonders whether the character being portrayed is Robin Hood or Santa Claus.

Admittedly, Robin Hood is like Shakespeare in that the story is eternal and may convincingly be transplanted to other settings and periods, so I don't object on principle to modernizing the story.  But the story still needs to be believable within the context one chooses.  To remake Robin Hood after Mr. Rogers, the setting needs to be similarly altered to one in which the revised character is credible; to re-cast Robin as some sort of modern group therapy leader while leaving him in a Middle Age setting simply makes him appear ludicrous.

Perhaps that was the series producers' intent - to create a comedic version of the tale along the lines of Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood Men in Tights,"" in the which such ridiculously context-inappropriate spectacles as that of merry men performing rap numbers was used for comedic effect.  Yet the BBC Robin Hood seems too patronizingly moralizing to make for an effective comedy.

In sum, this is an entertaining series and provides another fix for Robin Hood junkies like myself, but it could have been better done.",1245456000,2,2566,5.035460992907802

2778108,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Let me begin by saying that this is NOT a historically accurate, true to the original, retelling of the story of Robin Hood.  It is an ADAPTATION, and a good one at that.

Therefore, this series is worth buying.  It is expertly cast, (great for Richard Armitage fans!!!!) and has just the right amount of adventure, turmoil, social analysis and good vs. evil conflict.  It is often tongue-in-cheek, which is refreshing and surprising, so it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Simultaneously, it has profound moments with current relevance that positively contributes to its diversity.

This is a show that can be watched by the entire family, although there are incidents of violence, it is strongly emphasized Robin Hoods anti-killing motto.  These instances are mild compared to current video game scenarios.

2778109,1,B000NQQ4DI,"This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon, but I was so moved by how all around horrible this series is, I felt it was my duty to warn others about it.
There are so many bad things about this production of Robin Hood I don't really know where to begin......

The writing is more than exceptionally poor, the fact that the production is being presented as a period piece yet attempts to modernize the image of Robin Hood into a hipster accounts for that.
  It seems they wanted to make the production as politically correct as possible, which again, conflicts with a believable and enjoyable portrayal of this time period to everyone except drooling morons of which there apparently are enough of in this world to give this trainwreck a second season.

I mean come on, a Robin Hood who doesn't shoot any of the sheriff's men and who is threatening to kill the sheriff in every episode. Jeez.

  There are so many holes in the writing that going into extensive detail would take too much time, and I'm already trying to forget that I ever wasted my time watching this. I have even considered a full on lobotomy to remove it from my mind completely, it seems like it would almost be worth it.

  I am generally baffled by the random paper thin motivations of the characters and situations that I truly marvel at how the script got to the screen to begin with.

  The Costume designs are another oddity, it's as if they could never really decide on and commit to either doing a period piece or a modern one and tried to please both camps by landing somewhere in the middle.
  Marion's are especially bad, as well as Guy Gisborn who is wearing what plays as a futuristic sci-fi leather coat which looks like a reject costume design from Dune.

  Fight scenes play out as if they were shot in a film student's backyard with his friends to get an idea of what ""staged"" combat is like to film.
  There seems to always be a lack of extras to play the sheriff's men so Robin and his men are rarely outnumbered but usually run away from the brawl. I suppose if they stayed, fought and took the castle it would mean the end of the series, what a pity and a loss to the artistic world that would be....

The editing is an amature mess, one would probably have better luck getting a better overall presentation if you choose a name from a phone book at random and had them cut the film.

This series is a good example of the trite crap that is turned out by mediocre film school graduates who go to work for the BBC because they either lack real creativity or are simply whoring themselves out for the paycheck. I really do think that the studio hired people to write rave reviews for this on here, or at least I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt of having good taste.
  But alas, the fact that this series has a second season shakes my faith in humankind and reminds me that we truly are living in a dark age.

  Don't buy this series, rent it, or even watch it for free, unless you are researching what not to do when making films. If it is viewed in this way, then it is a valuable tool in combating the chance that something like this will ever be made again and it should be studied throughly.

  If you already own the series, dig at least a three foot hole, place the box set inside and burn it, then bury the melted mess so we are not embarassed in the eyes of future generations if a copy of this is ever found.",1242777600,13,3430,4.297507788161994

---------------------------------------
This modern, 21st Century spin on the classic Robin Hood legend is pretty fun. If you enjoyed purposefully cheesy action series such as ""Xena"" and ""Hercules,"" there's a good chance you'll like this series, too.  Robin and his merry men all develop their personalities fairly slowly, but there's one great character straight out of the gate, and that's Keith Allen's magnificently twisted, puckishly evil Sheriff of Nottingham, a performance that has a lot of Tim Curry in it, but also its own unique charm. I was leery of this show after seeing some of the more critical reviews, but not that I've watched Season One, I'm totally on board. It's not great art, but it is a fun show. Plus, I'm a sucker for Robin Hood stuff anyway, so what's not to love?  Definitely worth checking out.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1241308800,,896,5.0

2778115,4,B000NQQ4DI,"I am currently going through this first season DVD set with my husband after having watched the second season FIRST, so am seeing the series out of sync - that said, while Errol Flynn/Olivia DeHavilland's film version of the legend will ALWAYS remain my favorite version, this one is a fun, while anachronistic (in costumes, and particularly dialogue) show.  Robin of Loxley returns from the Holy Land with his faithful sidekick Much to find his home and his lands under the 'caretaking' of Sir Guy of Gisborne, and to find his old friend, Edward, former Sheriff of Nottingham (and the father of Marian) supplanted by the evil new Sheriff.  It isn't long before Robin has to choose between his principles and decide to become an outlaw or to quash his feelings to exist under the tyranny of the new Sheriff.  As everyone knows what Robin chooses I won't bother to go into details.
  As far as the cast goes, the outstanding performances are the 'bad guys' - Keith Allen as the completely sociopathic Sheriff, without conscience, remorse or empathy for his fellow man (and coming from my background as an adoptive mom, I would say he definitely was afflicted with RAD as a child) whereas Sir Guy is also wonderfully and wickedly portrayed by the outstanding Richard Armitage - an actor I didn't even know existed until seeing the wonderful BBC production of North and South recently because it was sitting in my Elisabeth Gaskell collection from Costco and I finally got around to popping it into the DVD player.  Armitage's Sir Guy seems to also have sociopathic tendencies; but unlike the Sheriff, does seem to have some capacity for love and for empathy with his fellow man(or in other words, had mild to moderate attachment disorder as a child, or perhaps ODD issues).  Sir Guy's costume is a combination black leather cowboy duster/biker dude outfit, which keeps my husband and I wondering if he is hiding his Harley somewhere (and from my old Wyoming resident days makes me think that Sir Guy would have fit in quite well at the old Buckhorn Bar in Laramie, Wyoming in the early 1990s!).
  As far as the rest of the cast are concerned, Jonas Armstrong's Robin is a cocky, mischievous, fun-filled jokester/trickster, which works fairly well for the character.  Armstrong's physicality strikes me as a bit Brad Pitt-esque, with scruffy beard, and his interpretation of Robin grew on me as I got into the series more.  The rest of the ""Merry Men"" which include a woman - the Moslem slave-turned-Robin-follower Djaq (after Robin helps rescue her) are all portrayed by the usual BBC talent.
  The only disappointment for me was the gal cast as Maid Marian.  Lucy Griffiths, who is very young in this first season, is not a bad actress, but sometimes her choices and her almost one note performances at times make it hard to believe that Robin and Guy would both be so passionately in love with her.  She is certainly not in the caliber of Olivia DeHavilland or even some of the other Marians in years past.  After seeing some of the awesome talent that the BBC has put in their other period dramas, it is hard to conceive that they couldn't have found an actress who is so incredibly gorgeous and with such spirit that one can quite understand why the two men are willing to come to such fisticuffs over her.  It would have been nice to see someone with a Jane Seymour, Greer Garson, young Liz Taylor or that sort of beauty and talent cast as the feisty yet feminine Marian.  (Does nobody out there exist like that anymore?)  In this series Marian must struggle between the wicked yet outstandingly handsome wannabe noble Sir Guy (and really, Armitage is, in the looks department, on a caliber with Tyrone Power or Cary Grant of old - and certainly his talent from what I've been able to view of his work seems to be quite on a par with both of those idols - perhaps surpassing Power in the talent department) and the handsome-yet-more-boy-next-door-but-good-hearted-and-true-noble Robin.  There are moments when Armitage is giving Griffiths the full benefit of his acting prowess and she doesn't always return the favor in like measure.
  As a Catholic, my only other disappointment is that all the priest and nun characters are either lampooned or shown as wicked or heartless hypocrites.  And when the purportedly Catholic (as all Christians were in this time in England, sorry history revisionists) characters marry, they are content to let Robin or some lay person marry them - this was and still is only allowed in a time of crisis when no clergy member was available as far as I am aware (Or was taught by my Jesuit educated parents on the subject) - true the marrying couple gives each other the sacrament, but if a priest could be found all attempts would have been made to have one officiate.  It is sort of like making an act of perfect contrition instead of going to confession - it suffices if a priest isn't available, but then if one is the Catholic lay person is BOUND to find one.  In past versions of the legend the 'bad' clerical characters were at least balanced by the kindly, true Christian presence of Friar Tuck in the gang.  But, if one believes things claimed by Edward Stourton in his old ABSOLUTE TRUTH on the Second Vatican Council, the BBC has been filled with marxist types for some time so their anti Catholic/anti Christian prejudice, which is quite common now all over the globe and really as popular as it was in early America, is not to be surprised at.  I hear that Tuck is making an appearance in season 3; so I hope that some attempt will be made at fair play in this area, but I've long learned not to expect balance or fairness where the entertainment industry is concerned anymore.  (I did agree with the anti torture themes presented in the series, which were obviously a thinly veiled reference to recent military realities.)",1238025600,3,5869,4.710654936461388
2778126,5,B000NQQ4DI,"This is Robin Hood for a new generation; if you're looking for historical accuracy, or adhesion to the classic story, look elsewhere. That being said, BBC has done an awesome job of reimagining the story, with very modern sensibilities (and a little bit of political commentary, if you squint and are in the mood for such things).

The best thing about this show is the characters; unlike most other incarnations, the spotlight is turned often to relatively minor characters, and the main characters are much more realistic. Robin is hardly the perfect hero he's portrayed as in other versions; he's vain, reckless, and arrogant, and has a tendency to be a little too self-sacrificing (the word `martyr' comes to mind). What's more, he can be more ruthless than his compatriots are necessarily comfortable with one minute, and squeamish when it comes to killing anyone the next. He's liable to start obsessing over something so much that little else matters to him (in one episode he's so fixated on a revelation about Gisborne's role in the injury that sent him back to England in the first place that he refuses to help the gang save Djaq from the Sheriff, and at the prospect of losing Marian to Gisborne, he sits in the forest and sulks while his men help Marian's father try to save the king from one of the Sheriff's plots).

Marian is no damsel in distress (especially when we find out what she does at night) and has her own issues to work out concerning her feelings for Robin and Gisborne and where she really belongs in the world, not to mention her father's mollycoddling. She yearns for independence and escape from both the irritatingly single-minded Gisborne and her overbearing father (in one episode, she remarks to Robin that she is tired of people-""and it is always men!""-telling her what was the wise course of action).

The Sheriff is even more cruel, devious and scathing than ever (comic villainy at it's very best), and is a man of thought, rather than action (in his character bio on BBC's website, his ""weapon"" is Gisborne). Also, you kind of have to feel sorry for Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's menacing (but rather bumbling), power-hungry second-in-command, who is honestly in love with Marian but a little shaky on what to do about it. He's further hindered by a nasty temper, some homicidal tendencies and an almost bipolar personality.

Robin's gang are much more than just his private army, as they have seemed in past incarnations; Much, Robin's former manservant and forever hungry, wisecracking sidekick, acts as his master's conscience and tries his best to keep him in check. Djaq, the Palestinian slave that the gang frees early on, and Will, the talented and wise-beyond-his-years carpenter, act as the voices of reason and group conscience. Little John serves as a pillar of strength and father-figure for the gang, and Allan provides considerable comic relief (""Not bein' funny, but..."").

There are times when the acting is shaky, but on the whole most of the stars manage to pull things off wonderfully (particularly Keith Allen, who plays the brilliantly-horrible Sheriff and Harry Lloyd (Will Scarlett) is so expressive without actually using words, he can convey the unspoken mood of the group with a single look.).

This production clearly didn't go for historical accuracy; some of the technology used by the gang and the sheriff are obviously non-medieval, and the costumes are ridiculously non-period (Robin wears a hoodie most of the time, Marian can be seen in everything from seventies-inspired flyaway cardigans to a bustled wedding gown that is nearly Victorian, and apparently the Sheriff's footwear of choice is Birkenstocks.)
However, as bizarre as the costuming can be, it's not usually so distracting that it takes away from the show, and while some of the episodes have a very modern feel (there's an episode that is positively Entrapment-esque), it's still fun and interesting.

Also unlike former Robin Hoods, BBC's Robin actually seems to have taken something back with him from the Holy Land; he wields a scimitar instead of a broadsword, uses a recurve bow and quotes the Koran. And while the storylines rarely incorporate anything directly ""Christian"", I don't think this is because anyone making the show wants to exclude them, but because of the setting; this is medieval Britain, after all- we all KNOW the majority of the population is probably Christian or at least pseudo-folk-Christian (a classification I totally just made up in reference to Christians still hanging on to Pagan traditions, no offense meant!). Do we really need references to remind us of it? Some complain of a lack of the iconic Friar Tuck (and I admit, it would have been interesting to have both a Christian priest and Djaq in the gang), but I hear season three will finally bring him into the story.
As for the reliance on communicating Islamic and Middle Eastern ideas, I think it's refreshing to watch something that isn't constantly bashing on Islam and rattling on and on about terrorism and patriotism and how we're the best country in the world (i.e. American news). Instead, the subtle political commentary seems to focus on the delicate relationship between Christianity and Islam in a war-torn world, and the importance of finding parallels between very different cultures. Maybe this is common in British television, but I'd like to applaud them anyway... it's about time someone decided to go for a little cultural relativism!

All considered, a great show that has plenty of adventure, action and some romance, interesting and compelling characters, and fun storylines.",1237334400,,5629,5.01283422459893

2778133,4,B000NQQ4DI,"As a child I was always fond of the tale of Robin Hood. He was very much the blue print of modern day super heroes. His bravery and benevolence had a profound effect on me so I was very interegd when I heard the BBC was making a new and modern version. After watching the first season I was pretty pleased with the direction that they decided to take with Robin. The basic outline has Robin returning with his man servant from the Crusades only to find his beloved home town of Locksley run by a corrupt sheriff. Robin has a choice, give in to the Sheriff and retain the lands owned to him or resist. Robin resists of course and take to the woods where he wages (non bloody) gorilla warfare on the Sheriff and his goons. Robin Hood is pretty entertaining but it goes get repetitive quick. Many episodes are the following, The Sheriff or Robin have a plan to screw the other over, One of Robin's men gets caught, Robin rescues them. The Sheriff gets mad,swears revenge. usually in that order. With that aside the show has some cool components that make it unique to other versions of Robin hood. Like Marian being the vigilante ""The Knight Watchmen"" and the constant back drop of the Crusades. Though the show often wanders into ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" like campy it still is very worth addition to the Robin Hood Mythos. check it out!",1220659200,,1335,4.475409836065574

Yeah Warner the number 1 studio that Blu-Ray fans complain about on the forums. Well anyways I thought the show was entertaining and it did not bore me. But there was a few times where I felt like I was watching Smallville. We have Robin in love with Marian but yet Marian is going to wed Gisborne one of the bad guys. And what does Robin do about his true love being engaged he pouts and complains much like Clark Kent did when he found out Lana got engaged with Lex. Then on the day of the wedding what does Robin do? He sits out on a field and pouts and even insults his best friend Much played by Sam Troughton(Patrick Troughtons Grandson) Well I guess it was better then what Clark did on Lana's wedding day when Clark pretended that his dog shelby was Lana. What love does to people!
Well as for The Blu-Ray version of Robin Hood I thinks its a pretty good set. The episodes look pretty good in HD. Sherwood Forest looks nice and color full in HD. As for The Dolby Digital sound?

2778158,1,B000NQQ4DI,"Here are my biases.  To do Robin Hood, you face two specters of the past.  Either you will film a movie and it has to be different and better (or at least as good as) Robin Hood with Errol Flynn; or you will make a television show and have to compete with the visionary Robin of Sherwood (and compete with both Michael Praed and then Jason Connery's Robins).  Having gone the TV show route, the question is, what can you say about this show compare to its predecessor?

This show is bad.  I have no other word for it.  The creators may be looking to make a hip, relevant and ""updated"" Robin Hood show, but, they created a mess.  A post traumatic stress disordered Robin who can't stand to kill anyone after his time on the Crusades returns to merry old England with a predictable sidekick and finds out that the Sheriff of Nottingham is using the Global War on Terror, I mean the Crusades, as just one excuse of many to oppress the peasants.

If there was on fire creativity available in the writing, characterization and acting, they might just pull it off.  However, it is a dull dud.  It is a pity, because there is some obvious talent in the production, but it is just not utilized.  I cringed at every episode I was able to get through, and then wished I had the time back.

This show is bad.  Get the Robin of Sherwood series or watch Errol Flynn and hope that someday someone else will have an original take on the tale that won't be as poorly thought out and ham handedly executed as the really bad original ideas in this show.",1216080000,18,1535,4.325174825174825

At first I wrote it off as some silly thing, but then after I had watched the episode, I couldn't wait to get my hands on more. After watching only a few episodes, I went to purchase the series. It's brilliant. There is no way to truly be historically accurate with Robin Hood. At one point, it was history, but now it has become legend and will one day become myth, just like Troy. The balance of humor and action are perfect, and the costumes add a certain charm to it. Who knows, maybe Lady Marian was a fighter. It is possible, look at Joan of Arc. I love the series, and even though we don't get it as quickly as those in the UK do, I pre ordered the second season as soon as I could. I would definitely recommend it. By all technicalities, it's the only TV show I actually watch. Other shows just don't hold my interest at all and the plot seems to become too thick. Robin Hood on the other hand, sticks to the same plot without all of the ridiculous intricacies to make it seem more exciting. It simply doesn't need it.",1213315200,3,1133,4.201834862385321
2778164,3,B000NQQ4DI,"This IS a good show! The season flew by. The performances are good, although the Sheriff and Much's certainly take the cake  (so much so that they overpower most others, although I don't mind-I love them!) and there are a few characters who downright annoy me (Djak). But from the very beginning it's been enough to grab me and keep me addicted, mostly because of the wide variety of characters whose personalities come out well on-screen. Some viewers will certainly find the show bit cliche and over the top, but if you want to zone out and have a good time, go for it.

The season begins with Robin and his devoted sidekick Much returning from the Holy Land, where they've been hard at work fighting for the king. Right from the getgo Robin finds disagreement with the new sheriff (mostly regarding taxation) and becomes an outlaw, stealing from the rich to give to the poor...you know the game. Meanwhile, Robin is still infatuated by Marion, with whom he had a bit of a relationship before he left for the Crusades five years earlier. The gang of Robin's loyal followers is soon assembled, and off they go on their missions to protect the countryside.

There are several things that are huge annoyances, although they don't really interfere with the show being just plain fun. The biggest issue for me is that Robin is hardly likeable. The only thing that keeps him afloat as your typical Good Guy is that he rides around doing acts of justice and he holds to his morals (MOST of the time. He even becomes murderous in a few episodes. I kept getting the vibe that sooner or later he was going to lose his mind. Robbinnn!). So other than that moral junk, and I do hate to say it, he's pretty much a selfish, pompus jerk. There it is; I would've been able to get into the series so much more if Robin wasn't so cocky. I really do want to fall in love with the hero, in a way. And don't get me wrong, Jonas Armstrong is a fine actor... so I suppose it's the writing to blame. Another issue is that the episodes simply don't connect! Each one follows a good storyline, but that's individually speaking. The episodes do seem to just start over. It's obvious that a good TV series should have each episode expanding and playing off the one before it, and that simply isn't the case here; this makes for limited character development. For example, in the end of one episode Allen becomes ill from accidentally drinking some kind of fluid they used to trick the sheriff. In the very last scene, we see him turning green, for heaven's sake! The writers never carry this on, and the next time we seen him he's perfectly healthy. What a world. And did anyone else notice how in the start of the season Much was pronounced ""Mooch,"" and as they went on their accents must have slacked because he became just ""Much."" Smaller pet peeves include toning down the distracting theme music, for crying out loud; the actors sometimes mumbling (combine this with their accents and thank goodness for subtitles); and last but certainly not least is Guy's overdone pleather wardrobe. Oh, Guy.

I hope I haven't gone overboard with the complaints because although these things do bug me, they're not enough to keep me from enjoying the show and being a dedicated viewer. I'm confident they will do the same for you. Enjoy!",1213142400,4,3302,4.572635135135135

This show has everything you could want in an hour long drama; young actor's with some very good raw talent(another thing good about the Brits =] ), great story-telling that never disappoints, and some of the best action sequences I've watched EVER in a television show. They really did a wonderful job training for these scenes and it is all very believable the way it is done. Same goes for the storylines. Many times I finished an episode and wondered how they could further develop the same story in what was beginning to feel like a very congested and all-around small region to work with. It essentially takes place in Nottingham and the forest locals, as did the book, with a few towns and villages thrown in for good measure. After about 6 episodes I started to wonder how the band of rogues would continue to infultrate the same castle over and over. Can the Sheriff and his men really be THAT stupid as to not know by then what the members of the group looked like, thereby allowing them to get in almost undetected episode after episode? I have to say, however, that the writers do it in very understandable and concievable manners. That, to me, is the mark of a great series, continuity and believability. One other thing that made this series truely full in all area's was the humor. I constantly found myself laughing out loud at this show. I'm a lover of british comedy anyhow, but the character's do such an outstanding job of creating the humor through their own acting technique's, the actor playing Robin Hood especially(something about his personality makes him magnetic, even through moments when he seems cocky and full of himself).

Every episode has a great mix of action, adventure, drama, comedy, and romance. Not only does it have all these great things, but it lacks what gets tiresome in so many other shows: The violence is never overly brutal, and we're not subjected to graphic sex scenes (I'm thinking particularly of the Tudors, another show I enjoy but find tasteless and tactless in this regard).

Robin Hood blends some of the best aspects of family-friendly adventure shows, like Hercules and Xena, with modern television story-telling, especially of season- and series-long plot arcs. And in these regards, this new Robin Hood series passes with high marks.

The writing and acting is first-rate, and the characters reveal their depth little by little, as each are given turns in the spot-light. Still, a show like Robin Hood lives and dies by the Robin/Marion relationship and the ability of the villains not just to be sinister, but also vulnerable and, at times, hilarious.

I don't want to give away any spoilers, but keep an eye out for what I'll call ""the proposal scene,"" with Robin outside Marion's window.

You can even see Guy of Gisborne's struggle to reconcile what he is doing with his long buried morals...poor old Richard Armitage only has alot of hooded looks to work with though and he has so much eye makeup on that he could give Theda Bara a run for her money....All the rest of the cast are likeable in a rough and ready streetwise way..You even like the Sherriff somewhat he is so unremittingly bad...the series is okay but it could have been so much better with a little  more work on the storylines and less trying to be so ""cool""....having a bit of a struggle with myself whether to buy series two or not",1206835200,,2011,4.494535519125683

 2.  Robin intervenes saves the day.
 3.  The Sheriff does something else dastardly -- someone often dies.
 4.  Robin defeats the Sherrif and threatens to kill him.
 5.  Robin is a hero.
 6.  Repeat next episode.

Maybe the series changes, but the stupid cookie cutter plot is a satire of itself. Maybe the series writers and producers did this on purpose, but I'm unsure. Robin Hood is inept since he constantly defeats the truly evil sheriff and then lets him go with empty threats.

I have been unable to watch the complete series and it could very well change. the sheriff may become competent, which would prevent Robin Hood from constantly getting the sheriff alone and threatening him.

2778176,4,B000NQQ4DI,"Were you a fan of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys?  Or its spinoff, Xena: Warrior Princess?  If so, you might like this show.  If not, don't say I didn't warn you.  The thing about those shows that made them so entertaining was that they were both funny and dark and had likeable characters.  Well, the same is mostly true for this version of Robin Hood - don't expect a historically accurate serious drama and you won't be disappointed.  Don't be annoyed that the costumes and sets look too modern, that the dialogue is sometimes funny but often silly, or that the characters don't quite match up to the classic Robin Hood characters you'll find in earlier productions of Robin Hood, and you will like this  show.

Not that I'm saying that this is the kind of show where you have to turn off your brain to have a good time.  In fact, though the first season took a while to find its sea legs, I've found that this show got considerably better as it progressed, particularly with continuity and how the storyline all pulled together.  All the fighting and stuntwork are really fun to watch and very realistic-looking (makes sense since the cast has mentioned numerous times how often they've been injured).  The archery is particularly cool.

I don't understand all the negative comments about the casting (okay, some of them could be valid).  Yes, I will admit that Jonas Armstrong, no matter how cute he is, looks way too young to be playing Robin Hood.  He's very boyish, but he more than compensates with his acting IMO - he comes off as a protective and zealous and loyal Robin and has great chemistry with his castmates.  I will admit that Keith Allen is too hammy in his role as the evil sheriff but he's still very entertaining so I'll forgive him for that.  I suppose the weak cast link is Lucy Griffiths, the actress who plays Marian but only when it comes to playing opposite Jonas's Robin, and only in this season.  Maybe it's just me, but if I had to do scenes with Jonas where we were supposed to play flirty, I wouldn't glare at him or act like a stick of wood.  Yes, I understand that Marian is supposed to be angry at Robin for leaving her to fight in the war, but even still, I think her acting is a bit off in those scenes.

The show does start off slow at first but it's still enjoyable and really grows on you.  It feels a little formulaic at times but I still had a good time watching.  If I can just give the writers a few tips:

1.  Quit having the sheriff say ""la dee da dee da"" all the time.  It's overused and annoying!

2.  Yes, the dialogue doesn't need to be medieval because this is a modern interpretation of Robin Hood, but having the sheriff saying ""shut up"" is a bit much.

3.  Is it really necessary to have Robin be so mean to Much all the time?  I get that they're supposed to be old friends, but cruel remarks are not  banter.

I highly recommend this show!  :)",1203897600,5,2901,4.3745318352059925

The sets and the scenery are nice, but I'm 66 years old now, and I don't want to see a Robin Hood I could beat the snot out of.  Richard Greene made a more believable Robin Hood, at least he shot people.  Well, back to the series, I believe I'll start rooting for the Sheriff of Nottingham.",1203724800,9,581,4.293577981651376
2778188,4,B000NQQ4DI,"I really enjoyed this TV series and I am glad I picked it up.

I honestly was not too keen on watching it. I've been watching Robin Hood movies since I was a kid, and grew out of them. I still remember reading Robin Hood as a child in class. Reading a book in class, and knowing you will be tested and graded on it is not the same as reading a book in your own leisure time. It takes all the fun out of reading the book.

Since I ran out of episodes of Lost, Battlestar Galactica, The 4400, Nip Tuck, to mention just a few of my favorite TV series, I decided to pick up Robin Hood out of sheer lack of other visual entertainment.

We all know the story of Robin Hood since childhood. Robin of Locksley heads home from the Crusades to find his people starving and ill-treated by the new Sheriff of Nottingham. In order to save his people, he sacrifices his title and land, and turns against the Sheriff. He becomes an outlaw, stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Robin treated women, the poor, and people of humble status with courtesy. A good deal of the impetus for his revolt against authority stemmed from popular resentment over the laws of the forest that restricted hunting rights.

His childhood love Marian comes alive in these episodes as a fighter and swordswoman. Before Robin had returned from the Crusades, she had already taken the cause of the poor, protecting them and defending them from the ruthless Sheriff. She becomes known as the night watchman, but no one knows her true identity, until Robin discovers it much later.

Robin's feelings towards the Crusades are revealed in these episodes. He is against using religion as a pretext for going to war. He feels the Crusades are a mistake, and that peace should be forged between the Christians and the Muslims. It is revealed in one episode that the Sheriff's right hand, Sir Guy, journeyed conspicuously to the Holy Lands disguised as a Muslim and tried to kill the King of England in order to keep the war going. In another episode, the son of the Muslim leader secretly journeys to England to forge peace. Apparently, all sides want peace, but evil forces conspire to turn both sides against each other to continue the war. I found this pretty interesting. In truth, though, the stories that come to us from the 14th century about Robin Hood do not mention any of this. In fact, Robin Hood might have never participated in the Crusades. The popular modern belief that he was of the time of Richard I probably stems from a fabrication by an 18th-century antiquary named William Stukeley.

So was Robin Hood a real historical person? The stories of Robin Hood are told to us through ballads dating back to the 14th century. The early ballads make it clear that the action took place chiefly in south Yorkshire, not in Nottinghamshire. This too was a later fabrication. None of the various claims identifying Robin Hood with a particular historical figure has gained much support, and the outlaw's existence may never have been anything but legendary. But don't tell kids this! Santo Claus is a real person too!

The swords fighting in the first few episodes were terrible. You could easily tell that the characters were nowhere near hurting each other. In other words, the fighting was not realistic. However, the fighting does improve in later episodes.

The acting is great with lots of humor thrown in. My favorite character is actually Sir Guy. He is portrayed more of a victim of love than a villain. I did feel sorry for him, and found myself sympathizing with him on many occasions. In fact, Marian double-crossed him.

The episodes improve as the series progresses. Overall, I recommend this series. I am looking forward for Season 2.",1203638400,3,3720,4.641337386018237
2778189,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I am thoroughly amazed by how utterly cool this show was. It was nice to see a version of Robin Hood that really swashbuckled, where the merry men were kind of thuggish, and Robin Hood can't just kill the Sheriff because he has to win over the hearts and minds of the people, and get them to overcome their fear of the guy.

What can I say about Keith Allen's Sheriff of Nottingham? Never has there been a Sheriff who genuinely enjoys being evil so much. I stole this guy's personality for one of my D+D games, and guess what? The players in this game were like ""There's no way a human being could be that evil...""

Well...they're wrong. :) I can't wait to see the sheriff start doing things like ""You're a Jeweler, you don't need that leg."" and ""You're a messenger, you need to run, but you don't need that arm...""

2778197,4,B000NQQ4DI,"Now there have been many Robin Hoods over the years, from Errol Flynn to Kevin Costner, to Carry Elwes, but this version outshoots them all by far.  Not only one of the best visual renditions of the legends ever made, it's also a fantastic Medieval action-adventure in its own right, especially considering that (with the exception of HBO's Rome) most television productions of pre-modern times tend to be horribly campy and cheesy (remember the Xena and Hercules series?).  This production of the legends, fresh out of Britain and now playing on BBC America as well as released on DVD is a completely new rendering of the story, made fully modern in it's imagery and poignancy, but still keeping to many of the classic elements of the tale while giving them a new spin.

First off, Robin himself is younger than his cinematic predecessors.  In this version, he is still in his early or mid-twenties.  He's a little more cocksure of himself than the other depictions, especially when considering his own mortality.  As Marion points out, he acts as if he could never die.  He can be a bit of a womanizer too, as evidence in the first episode when he decides to dally with a peasant's daughter right behind her father's back.  But Jonas Armstrong proves that Robin is the original romantic swashbuckler, with super-human archery skills to boot.  The show takes full use of modern special effects to render Robin's mad bow skills, allowing him to pluck off arrow after arrow with amazing precision.  Robin's fighitng style is also different, influenced by his time in the Holy Land.  Instead of using the typical English longbow, he wields a shorter re-curved Turkish bow, which the show uses to explain some of the edge of his archery prowess; additionally rather than fighting with a broadsword, he carries a Middle Eastern scimitar.  One other thing that this younger, hipper, Robin presents is a far greater sense of altruism and idealism.  Sure, the very nature of Robin Hood is his philanthropic ""rob from the rich, give to the poor"" philosophy, but this time he takes it a step further.  While it's clear that Robin could use his superior archery skill to pick off any number of baddies, Robin holds to a philosophy of (almost) non-violence.  Far from being a pacifist, he nevertheless refuses to use outright violence to defy the Sheriff and his men, stating several times that bloodshed has solved little.  While giving a depth to Robin's charater, it does stretch the level of believability sometimes.  There are several moments when Robin is face-to-face with the Sheriff, and could easily put a dagger in his throat or an arrow through his gut, and after the third time this happens you kind of want to shout ""Oh off it, and kill the bloody bugger!""

Speaking of the Sheriff of Nottingham, Keith Allen portrays that most wickedly evil, amusingly dark depiction of the classic villain (sorry Alan Rickman, you're no longer on the top).  Unlike in other version of the tale, the Sheriff is no skilled swordsman, maniacal warrior, or masterful battlefield tactician.  Keith Allen's Sheriff is older, shorter, and scrawnier, yet no less menacing.  The Sheriff here is the brains behind the operation, sitting in his castle at Nottingham and plotting all the evil cruelties to dish out to the peasantfolk.  Not just evil, he's actually funny in a dark, twisted sort of way.  He gets a queer pleasure out of being evil, and it's rather infectious.  You have to chuckle to yourself when he sits watching his guards plucking out peasants' tongues and casually remarks on how he drinks the finest of wines...and yet strangely enough can't taste any of them.  Oh well (dumps the wine out).  Oh, not to mention he crushes sparrows with his bare hands.  At the Sheriff's side is Sir Guy of Guisbourne, played by the darkly handsome and sleekly villainous Richard Armitage.  Most versions of the legends have either passed Sir Guy up, or relegated him to a minor role as an ever-failing henchman.  Here, he is given all his evil due, dressed in shining black leather that perfectly compliments his sharp, narrow features and blazing eyes.  As the Sheriff's strong-arm, he is the military force of the shire, and depicts a cool calm exterior to the Sheriff's often frivolous demeanor.  The interplay between the characters is probably one of the best things about the show.  It's never openly depicted, but one gets the sense that Sir Guy is rather fed up with the Sheriff, and easily believes he can do a better job.  Yet the Sheriff represents job security, and even Sir Guy is a little afraid of him.

As for the rest of the gang, they also get their fair share of makeovers.  Much (or Mudge, depending on what spelling you use)  is no longer the gawky miller's son saved by Robin Hood, but is rather Robin's former manservant raised to squire for his valor during the Crusades.  He presents an amusing comic relief for the band of Merry Men, and almost every time he opens his mouth, something funny comes out.  Will Scarlett is perhaps one of the most drastic changes, both in terms of personality and backstory.  In the original ballads and version of the tale, Will is often Robin's cousin, forced into a life of thievery after killing several of the Sheriff's men in self defense.  He is usually portrayed as being sneaky, cunning, and not always 100 percent on Robin's side.  In this version, Will is the son of one of Robin's serfs, a quiet boy barely in his teens who is sentenced to be hanged for stealing grain from Sir Guy's stores.  Little John is also a different character.  He still has the super-human strength and massive size that is part and parcel of the character, but he is a more solemn, somber character rather than the boisterous, rowdy man given over in other depictions.  When he walks on screen for the first time, you can't mistake him for who he must be, but you also have to remark on the new wardrobe he's given (the most striking being a dark floor-length highwayman's coat).  Finally, Marion herself is a striking character...in more ways than one.  Lucy Griffiths plays what is perhaps the most gorgeous of all Maid Marions, with rosy cheeks, dark sheeny hair, and the most beautiful pair of grey-green eyes I've ever seen.  She is not the naive, simpering maiden of some stories, but a strong-willed character in her own right with convictions just as strong as Robin.  All in all, the idea of the Merry Men (who are never actually called such in the series) is more realistic and believable.  Instead of being an entire army living in a treetop village in Sherwood Forest, they are ragged band of about half a dozen men, tromping from makeshift campsite to campsite, perpetually on the run and pressed for food and resources.

As far as the show goes in its production and storytelling, it is also masterful.  The series doesn't try to come off as too heavy-handed like some Robin Hood versions (such as the 1992 Kevin Costner film), and maintains a light air of action-adventure.  One simply needs to listen to the show's opening theme to get that sense of swashbuckling adventure.  Humor is spiced plentifully throughout, offset by the disgustingly vile actions of the Sheriff and Sir Guy.  Yet despite the lightheartedness that the show tries to maintain, it rarely devolves into the campy realm of such series as Xena:  Warrior Princess or Hercules:  The Legendary Journeys.  Mind you, there are a few moments when plot loopholes or storyline conveniences become a little too much (one has to wonder how many times Robin can sneak into Nottingham Castle without getting caught), but those moments are few and can be easily ignored in the spirit of the series.  The only other minor complaint is the episodic nature of the series; most plotlines are developed and wrapped up in a single episode rather than drawing out into intricate and complex scenarios.  But again, this is an action-adventure series, not a high drama, and it works for that type of show.  All in all, it's an amazing series filled with good old fashioned thrills, swordfights, and chivalrous romance.  One of the most dashingly imaginative imaginings of the epic tale, it fails to disappoint and hits all the right bull's eyes.

Minuses:  some rather large plotholes (ignore them and show works fine), some costumes which are rather too modern to be even remotely historically accurate, apparently a budget that wasn't large enough to include real chainmail.  Oh, and where the Tuck is the Friar?!  After playing him for an entire summer on-cast at a Medieval Faire, I was personally offended with his omission.",1195430400,18,8621,4.813179347826087
2778198,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Whether or not you like the BBC's new version of Robin Hood will depend largely on what you are looking for in entertainment. If you are looking for a serious show, a history lesson, a classic interpretation of Robin Hood or if you eschew all things modern then you should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking to enjoy a few hours of guilty pleasure that is light and campy enough to make you feel good, but with characters complex enough to keep you interested, then you will thoroughly enjoy this charming series from the BBC. The acting is superb, the cinematography lovely and there is fun to be found in each episode.

Granted, the show relies heavily on the suspension of disbelief and the writers make no attempt to offer an authentic version of medieval life - but surprisingly this is what makes the series so fresh and alluring.

And while the scenarios may seem implausible, the characterizations are the most realistic I've seen of any Robin Hood interpretation. What kind of noble lives in the forest with a bunch of outlaws and steals from rich people to give to poor people? According to this series, Robin Hood - well played by Jonas Armstrong - is trying to atone for his sins. He feels guilty for the numerous murders he committed in the name of a war he no longer believes in and wants to set things right not only with Nottingham but with his inner demons.

This question of motive and circumstance is what gives the series its backbone. The production avoids a black and white narrative of good vs. evil. Amidst the lighthearted romp is the exploration of the very grey areas on the subject. For all his admirable qualities, Robin Hood is not a saint. He is reckless, egoistic and exhibits a ruthlessness that often disappoints his loyal followers. Conversely, his rival, the vicious Sir Guy of Gisbourne, reveals a tender side in his love for Marian. He is willing (unlike Robin) to express the depth and sincerity of his affection, and Richard Armitage's skillful portrayal allows the audience to feel Gisbourne's desire for redemption acutely.

Filmed in beautiful 1.78:1 widescreen, the screen format really fits this material quite well, from the sets to the wilderness environment its shot in in apparently Hungary.  The costuming is very well done.  At first it was hard to accept the leather-looking duster that Guy of Gisborne was wearing, but it appears to have changed slightly as the series progresses.  Uniforms for the castle guard are also very well done.  I really must commend on the sets of the castle and medieval house settings.  Very realistic looking.

Casting and acting is also very well done.  Ignore the negative reviews concerning this aspect.  Very good character development across the series.  Some very intense moments for some of the characters as well.  Fight choreography is also very well done for a TV production.  Much more realistic than anything on Hercules or Xena.  But somewhat on par with what Beastmaster had.

If you have any interest in the Robin Hood mythos, I highly recommend  giving this series a try.

2778207,2,B000NQQ4DI,"After reading the glowing reviews for this new BBC Robin Hood series, I was excited to see the series myself. The series does for the Robin Hood myth what Xena and Hercules did for Greek Mythology. Don't expect character growth; don't expect intelligent writing; and most of all don't expect any variation from episode to episode. Essentially, each episode follows a predictable and dull pattern: the Sheriff has an evil scheme, Robin must stop it without bloodshed, and most importantly, with a cocksure attitude and very little intelligence. This series doesn't grapple with any of the core issues behind the Robin Hood myth, and doesn't push the character in any new directions (like the old 1984 BBC series Robin of Sherwood). What we get is a happy group of peasants being protected by a ridiculously arrogant hero who doesn't ever question his motives or his means. This incarnation of Robin is a strict pacifist whose refusal to engage the enemy with anything but his dull wit gets old after the first episode. Even worse is that his pacifism results in a number of silly devices to get Robin out of the sheriff's clutches. In one episode the sheriff simply lets Robin walk out of Nottingham castle while pouting and shaking his fist, even though Robin is within inches of the sheriff's henchmen. How can the sheriff respect Robin's demands if he knows there is nothing there to back them up? Even worse, how can the audience take them seriously? There are three positive things in this series: the sets, the costumes, and the filming/special effects. Hopefully, the series will begin to push the characters in some interesting directions in future installments, but as things stand now the series is flat.",1185408000,16,1713,4.910344827586207

Jonas Armstrong plays a believable Robin and Lucy Griffiths plays the saucy wench, Marian, who treads a fine line, pretending to be loyal to Guy while actually helping Robin. Things heat up as the seasons go on and the acting gets better and better. Keith Allen sometimes overdoes it with his jokes, but he is a funny character.

2778210,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I've been a fan of Robin Hood since I was old enough to read - and of all the movie and TV versions this is the best. The difference between this version and everything else, from Errol Flynn to the silly Disney version of the early 1970s to Kevin Costner's ROBIN HOOD - PRINCE OF THIEVES, they stuck with the idealized hero of the ballads and legends.

This Robin Hood is very real, very human, and gorgeous actor Jonas Armstrong plays him beautifully. He is the fun-loving figure of the legends who would, rather than kill an opponent, prefer to cut off his belt and watch his pants fall down so that he and his men can enjoy the embarrassment.

But there is a dark side to this Robin Hood. He can become obsessed, determined to do something he shouldn't, because someone has upset or angered him. In one episode, his ""merry men"" (Gordon Kennedy, Harry Lloyd, Joe Armstrong, and Sam Troughton) are at their wits' end to keep Robin from seeking a bloody revenge for a wrong done to one of his peasant friends.

The character of Maid Marian, played by Lucy Griffiths, is a gutsy, reasonably fearless young woman with her own ""secret identity,"" in which she does what the evil Sheriff of Nottingham has forbidden her to do: help to feed the poor of Locksley. She loves Robin, but resents the fact that he went to seek glory by fighting in the Crusades while, in his absence, his manor, Locksley, went to the dogs. Still, nonetheless, she and Robin often are forced to work together.

Keith Allen is deliciously nasty as the Sheriff of Nottingham - the man you love to hate. In fact, there does seem to be a new element added to his character: he appears to be a homosexual nurturing a secret desire for Robin. As in the legends, the Sheriff has no redeeming qualities at all.

The other bad guy in the series, Guy of Gisbourne, played by handsome Richard Armitage, is a bit more complex. He wants wealth and rank, and does what he has to in order to attain them. But the audience does get the sense that Gisbourne does have a conscience, however deeply buried it is. Unlike the Sheriff, he knows that much of what he does is wrong, and it bothers him, but his ambition gets the best of him almost every time. Plus, he does have one redeeming quality: He truly loves Marian.

There is one more character worthy of mention, and that is Djak, played by Anjali Jay. This is a character not in the legends: a young Saracen girl taken prisoner during the Crusades and brought back to England to work as a slave. After being rescued by Robin and the others, she becomes an invaluable member of the band when they learn that she has medical skills and a gift for healing. To disguise herself, Djak has cut her hair as short as a boy's and assumed men's clothing - and can fight beside the best of them. But it doesn't take away from her beauty and appeal: both Will Scarlet and Allan a Dale fall in love with her. She's delightful - and I hope the writers don't do something stupid like write her out or kill her off.

Even if you saw the series on BBC America, it's worth having in your DVD collection. It's great entertainment for a rainy night - or any time, for that matter. I for one am looking forward to season II - and to buying THAT DVD when it comes out. Enjoy!",1184803200,7,3262,4.372937293729373
2778211,5,B000NQQ4DI,"This version of Robin Hood is fantastic. So much better than the '80s Robin Hood BBC series that tried to shove too much black magic into the plots and ultimately made me quit watching it. This is a Robin Hood for fans of Indiana Jones and The Lord of the Rings. A gorgeous score, wonderful costumes, outstanding performances, riveting plots, cunning twists...I really can't brag on it too much. A couple of minor complaints: Friar Tuck is absent from this version. I have a feeling it's because of the current climate against anything Christian. Islam gets a lot more respect. Even Saladin is painted as a compassionate leader who wants peace above all else (yeah, right). Carl Ketcherside once suggested that the people who led the Crusades were not Christians, and I tend to agree. You cannot claim to be a follower of Christ and simultaneously participate in horrible acts of torture against other human beings. I wish contemporary writers would become aware of this fact and draw their religious characters more accurately. So, aside from the biased, uninformed view against Christianity that is evident in the writing, I endorse this Robin Hood wholeheartedly. Worth the full price!

So much better viewing the action on DVD without numerous commercial interruptions on the telly.

My only complaint about the added features is that I was hoping for some explanation of how those amazing archery scenes were shot.  Guess some mystery must remain.  But overall, the series is exciting and really captures the essence of what it must have been like to live under a tyrant.  Yes, I get it that there are numerous references to the Iraq war and the comparisons of the evil sheriff of Nottingham to President Bush.  But the political commentary is subtle and not overbearing.

2778242,5,B000NQQ4DI,"This show is not a historical reenactment. It is not Errol Flynn nor Mel Brooks. It is not tighly scripted but it IS a good TELEVISION show. There are anachronisms  - who cares - it makes the story make sense to modern audiences.

This is the best Robin Hood version I have seen. It gives you a feel for the times.  Has wonderful references to historical cultural activities.  The technology shown is very convincing. Who cares if it is from 1300s rather than 1100s - it is still good.

Robin is not a hero- he is a man trying to do the right thing given the circumstances.  Guy is not a villian - he is a man trying to do what he thinks is expected. The Sherrif is a politician  who is heartless and unethical.  Marian is caught between her family obligations and her compassion. These are multidimensional characters with complex interplay between them.

The best thing about it is this show we can all watch together. The story line is complex enough for me and my husband but the plot is direct enough for my 9 year old son.  The violence is downplayed and there is no gore. If a man gets shot with an arrow, he falls down. Anything disturbing occurs off screen.  There is flirtation and romance but no sex.

2778244,4,B000NQQ4DI,"A little too anachronistic for my tastes.... but I love the political satire of current issues.

I decided to check it out because I liked Richard Armitage (Guy of Gisbon), I find that his character as evil henchmen does not disappoint. Robin Hood is also well cast, an attractive young man with sad eyes who pulls off the earnest character in a believable manner, not too cocky or otherwise too alienating.

I think my biggest disappointment is the casting of the Sheriff. I like the actor Keith Allen, in other stuff I've seen. However, for some reason I don't like him as the sheriff. He comes off too campy and it throws off the show for me since the rest of it is played rather seriously. You can't pit a serious hero against a skipping  snickering dilettante who enjoys verbally sparring with irony and sarcasm. It just doesn't work. I'm not saying the Sheriff of Nottingham has to be totally butch and sadistically evil.... I don't mind showing him as merely capricious and selfish/self-involved... that is fine -- just something about his portrayal doesn't seem right for the time/setting. (especially the episode where he's at a public hanging with a shirt open most of the way down to display his chest hair or another where his Painting his Toenails!).

Speaking of time/setting.....it's supposed to be 1192 and to me some of the behaviors and dialogue are too jarringly anachronistic.

As a feminist I enjoyed seeing Marian as the ""night-watchman"" but is it really possible for those times?  I know they're trying to make her more interesting for today's female viewers and I don't just want her as a passive observer - so I'm kind of torn. I know women were basically chattel in terms of English law - and I'm not fond of seeing that -- but ignoring that fact also bothers me.
Other anachronisms: her practicing Tai-Chi and her wearing of barely there nightgown in a drafty castle, a little yellow crop-top sweater that looks like this years fashion or her perfect makeup (I know they had some basic eyeliner, blush & lipstick at the time) seem to caste an unrealistic tone to the show. I'm also all for more diversity in television, but would an African really be able to rise to be Master of Arms or an Abbess of a nunnery in those times?

Finally, as an atheist I find it refreshing that a character would admit to not being religious (even if it is the bad guy). But I hardly doubt that you could admit to ""godlessness"" and hold public office - especially under a king bent on a religious crusade and wiping out the ""infidels"".

Anyway, over all it is amusing and pretty good, so I look forward to Season 2. I know it's not supposed to be a perfect period piece so I can forgive the modern sensibilities (Especially since the deviations are closer to my beliefs anyway).

but mostly I like the show for it's political satire. It explores issues pertinent to America and Britain's invasion of Iraq.

It's exploration of the effects of war not only on those who go to fight, but those who stay at home. The idea of forcing the population to pay for a war they do not believe in. The moral issue of torture. Ruling the population through fear and intimidation. The fear and hatred of Muslims - ignorance of their culture.  I could go on.

When I first saw Jonas Armstrong as Robin I wasn't sure he would be right but was I wrong. His face is so expressive it's a delight to watch him. And Sam Troughton as Much seems to keep everyone-especially Robin-grounded with his sense of what is right and wrong. I wasn't prepared to like such a young Will Scarlet but he carries himself with such quiet dignity and grace that age just doesn't matter.

On the other hand, this series is engaging and often funny, with excellent acting by Armitage, Griffiths, Armstrong, Allen...well, every cast member. Sometimes the writers are a little heavy-handed with the modern parallels they draw, but it's only noticeable in the first few episodes. Otherwise, the strength of the series reveals itself through the complex interpersonal relationships between the characters. (My personal favorite is the Robin/Marian/Guy dynamic.) Additionally, Robin & Co. are well-rounded; each character has his/her own traits, history and humanizing features.

All in all, this is an appealing and endearing version of an old classic. Before watching this series, I was never remotely interested in the Robin Hood mythos, but the characters drive the story and the show ultimately benefits from palpable, modern situations and writing.",1182902400,9,1096,5.596385542168675

2778249,1,B000NQQ4DI,"You either love this BBC off-season replacement for Dr. Who, or hate it.  There's very little middle ground.  Either you leave your brain at the door and zone out, or gawk in amazement and embarrassment that such a show could be so popular in this day and age.  I fall into the latter category, yet still find myself watching - partly because I paid for the DVD set, and also because, much like a train wreck, or plane crash, I just can't tear my eyes away.

Okay, it's not that bad.  There are a lot of good things about this series.  For one thing, it certainly looks good.  The cinematography is first rate, casting the Hungarian forests and castle locations in beautiful, moody light.  The costume work is nice, though a bit too modern when it comes to some of Marian's outfits - but still nicely done all around.

Casting and acting are also quite good.  One or more characters are prone to overplaying some fundamental moral or ethical dilemma each episode, but this is probably more due to the directing and writing than to an inherent tendency to overact.

And there's the real problem - the writing.  The plots, characterizations, dialogue - the very modus operandi of the show's creators - range from mediocre to so bad as to be embarrassing.

The creators are apparently going for a hip, updated Robin (and supporting characters), and utilize the legend to address many current as well as long-standing issues.  Jonas Armstrong as Robin, in particular, is more in the vein of Orlando Bloom, vice Kevin Costner, Patrick Bergen or even Errol Flynn.  This updating, however, is usually done in total ignorance of the Medieval Setting and actual history.

Dialogue mixes what passes for 12th century speech with a constant stream of modern clich.  `Breadwinner,' `Call of The Wild,' `Sacked' (as in fired), `We don't do Town,' the Ben Franklin quote about death and taxes, `Willy-Nilly,' and `Economy Cuts,' are examples.  Even ignoring the historical inaccuracies, the wide-spread use of clich is a common sign of lazy, uncreative writing.

Other glaring historical disconnects include the casting of black actors in key supporting roles without any justification for, or even recognition of, their race (we are not talking Morgan Freeman here).  The most vocal of a group of Muslim slaves turns out to be a woman, with no consideration for the role of women in Islam at the time.  A group of miners working for the evil Sheriff actually go on strike - and the Sheriff's response is to fire them  (Hello!? - Feudal society?  Evil Sheriff of Nottingham?).

The over-simplified, often stereotypical portrayal of 12th century Muslim peoples, beliefs, mannerisms, dress and culture in general, over the course of several episodes, reminds me of the Hollywood portrayal of Asians, Hispanics and other religious and/or ethnic groups from decades past.  It's both embarrassing and insulting, especially given the sizable Muslim population in Great Britain.

But let's forgive and accept all that.  Let's embrace the modern Robin, the strong independent Marion, the free-wheeling style that allows the show to address terrorism and religious fundamentalism, the rule of law, modern politics and ethics, and so many other issues, in a way that is accessible and acceptable to a wide (if historically uninformed or at least intellectually undemanding) audience.

Unfortunately, we are still left with some really bad writing.  There are plot holes you could drive a truck through, and character action/motivation that constantly defies reason.  People all too often say things and/or do things in apparent ignorance or disregard for what happened in a previous episode, a previous scene, or even the last few lines of dialogue.

In an early episode, the Sheriff is seen to cut out the tongues of villagers, one per hour, until they give him the location of Robin.  In the next episode, he is compelled to publicly justify increased security measures (a speech about the war on terror, as it were) to these same peasants.

Early on we learn that Robin saved King Richard from Saracen assassins in the Holy Land, and his injury during this incident is what prompted his return to England.  In one episode, Robin recognizes the assassin's tattoo/scar on a prominent local noble, and is compelled to expose the noble and exact justice.  When relaying this to his friends, however, the latter are suddenly and inexplicably skeptical.  `Hate to say it, Robin, but I wasn't there,' or `I didn't see it.'

When the Sheriff traps our friends in the castle, and leads them into a courtyard to witness a hanging, nobody bothers to disarm our heroes - whose weapons are immediately put to use when the hanging is disrupted.

There's even an episode where upon finding a baby abandoned in the forest, Robin is somehow compelled to carry the infant everywhere he goes, whatever he happens to be doing.  On horseback, on the way to rescue a mate, during swords fights.  This allows him to chide his opponent for swinging at him when he has a baby, and to throw the bundle at the opponent (who of course catches it, allowing Robin to then hit him over the head).

There is one other consistent problem with the show - the action.  Many of the action sequences are conceived, blocked, shot and edited together in an amateurish unconvincing fashion.  Many stunts are simply bad rehashes of tricks done countless times before in film, which fail to deliver precisely because they are so poorly set up.  The trip wire across the road (horse trail in this instance) is used.  The slide for life has Robin using his bow to straddle/zip down a wire - a good gimmick, but the set-up is drawn out and obvious.  Robin does a back flip off a second story platform so we can gawk at it from three angles - great for style points, but having no plot significance as he could have just stepped off the ledge and dropped straight down.  Soldiers on horseback dismount before attacking a lone Robin on foot, one or two at a time.  There is a tendency to treat bows and arrows as guns, with one or two people armed as such holding off twice or more their number at close range (at one point a lone Merry man being instructed to escort four soldiers this way - do the math).

Except for one scene in the pilot, by the way, there are apparently only five or so Merry men - and normally the Sheriff and/or Sir Guy only have enough soldiers to slightly outnumber what ever Robin and company have in the current scene.

Were I to describe every historical flaw, every plot pain, every characterization goof, etc., we'd be looking at a small book's worth of text.  But I assume you get the idea.  If you perhaps count yourself among the blissfully ignorant who can buy off on this tripe (and enough of the BBC audience has done so to secure a second season), I'd advise you to at least check it out on BBC America first before buying the set.  If you're still interested, you could probably buy mine for a bargain - as I expect I will at some point tire of staring at the wreckage and the body parts, and want to recoup at least some of my losses.",1182816000,56,7106,4.7489812550937245

But it attempts quite a lot of plot! If you want a show that is historically accurate - forget this. It has updated the tale of Robin Hood (Wood!) for our times but still retains a sense of fun from the Errol Flynn pics and sprinkels some history here and there.

I didn't expect it, but this show really made me think about ""values"" in today's day and age. Why doesn't Robin just kill the sheriff? Sure another will be sent, but maybe he won't be as bad? Is murder o.k. now? After 9/11? How quaint it was when we really wondered if our governments should assassinate foreign leaders or preemptively start wars / remove dictators. Now you are weak if you don't immediately shoot to kill. Remember when good guys shot the gun out of the bad guy's hand instead of killing him? That is this Robin Hood. This series is very timely and thoughtful and still fun and romantic. Raves to Jonas Armstrong for creating a likeable and needy hero (he stays around to hear the good things said about him - cute)!

The sword fights resemble an elementary school production of Macbeth and the plots are as mundane as reruns of Matlock. Characters are one dimensional and sets resemble a Medieval Times restaurant or a bankrupt historical restoration park. Costumes are atrociously bad: a major character Gisborne looks like a pleather Matrix reject and chain mail is substituted with silver lame. (I swear I even saw a striped polo shirt in a crowd scene.) If those involved with the series could poke fun at themselves, this abysmal show would be side-splittingly hilarious. But, I'm told it's a drama . . . as dramatic and as earnest as any after-school special. If I could rate this series lower than one star, I would. I strongly urge you to bypass Nottingham in favor of truly exceptional historical drama like Rome.",1181606400,23,1146,4.973958333333333
2778265,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I have been seeing a lot of reviews here noting historical inaccuracies with this show. And while I agree that the dialog, costumes and hairstyles all have a contemporary feel, I think this helps the audience relate with the characters and invest in the story. I also love seeing what cool creations the designers will come up with every week!

The writers take liberties with certain scientific breakthroughs in history as well. For example, ""black"" powder or gun powder originated in China, and was not used in Europe until the 15th Century. The practice of acupuncture also began in China and didn't start in England until the 17th Century. However both examples were around Asia in the Middle Ages, so it's possible that Djaq would know of them...

Which leads me to another point regarding how the Arab world is portrayed on this show. I feel the writers do a great job of citing the accomplishments of Arab society in the Dark Ages. They had made far more advances in the sciences, than the western world at the time. I also think the emphasis on the Crusades is great social commentary on the tensions between Christians & Muslims, proving that not much has changed in almost 1,000 years!

Though the show takes many liberties with the Robin Hood legend and history itself, I feel that the writers and designers remain true to both, only in their own way. I definitely recommend this series!",1180656000,10,1398,4.744855967078189
2778266,5,B000NQQ4DI,"I was on the internet and a advertisement told me about this show, it looked cool, and I was a fan of Robin Hood, so I checked it out. I LOVED it. I was addicted from the first episode, it was suspenful, adventurous, romantic, and cruel and I waited anxiously for every episode. Each actor matches the characters perfectly. It may be somewhat different from the book, but has the main points. Buy it, It's so worth it!",1180310400,5,418,4.371794871794871

2778268,1,B000NQQ4DI,"Marginal actors, juvenille plots, and of course, very PC.

As an archer, I was anxiously awaiting this series, and was terribly disappointed. Took it of the DVR after about 4 episodes and couldn't be bothered watching the rest.

Why does Robin's servant/friend have to act like a complete buffoon?

Why does Marian walk around pissed off 90 percent of the time?

And why does the Sherrif of Nottingham seem to me like the least threatening person on the planet (next to Robin, that is).

Why bother doing a remake of this classic story only to turn it into a wishy-washy pile of PC claptrap that bears no resemblance to the original?",1179878400,20,633,4.666666666666667
2778269,4,B000NQQ4DI,"OK to start I know a bunch of people are going to whine about this review.
and for everyone who is going to say this review is not helpful will be women I almost guarantee you that.
 The BBC version of Robin Hood IMO is very well acted,
  The actors portray the characters very well
The sheriff being  particularly great.
  The scenery is even great, and the costumes and all the other surroundings are realaistic  to the time period.
  Now comes the bad news, one: they turned Robin Hood into a passafist, I mean the stories get a little old when every single one is, Robin breaking into the sheriffs castles rescuing someone and threating the sheriff the next time you do something I'll kill you, but the problem is  that he does the same thing in the next episode and Robin does the same threat and he doesn't kill anyone, he has a hard time even knocking someone out for crying out loud.
  That is one thing I don't like, the second is, Marian is NOT a warrior and I'm soo sick of people trying to make women warriors in every modern day series or movie about the dark ages, the fact is women were killed for trying to fight, so granted she does dress up like a man and fight,
 she still is waaay too butch for what that character is suppose to be.
  To make things worse, they make a woman a part of Robins marry MEN!!! WHY? I just don't get it, why can't people just get used to it, women where treated bad back then , they were not warriors and they didn't have any rights.
 I don't understand why they try soo hard to make it appear that they were equals back then?
  They even had a black woman in the show and they thought she was the head of the church !! Now the poor blacks back then where treated worse then the women and she was black AND a woman ,double whammy ,yet noone seemed to even notice or care!! so these things are in no way realistic to the time frame, and Im getting sick of the political correctness BS !
  however if these things don't bother you, then watch this show, it is a enjoyable series.
 It's only the first season so hopefuly they will make Robin fight in the second season.
  Oh and to the all who are not familiar to british series, they have only about 16 episodes TOPS per season and sometimes they have years in between seasons, ( Remember the AWSOME British Series Red Dwarf?) so hopefuly they won't do that here.
  There I tried to correct any mispelling I did before so hopefuly the looser who reads reviews and tries to find faults in the grammer,  will shut up and get a life now.
  Now please someone tell me why people don't find this review helpful. it has everything a review needs it says how well the acting is, the story and so forth, but in this P.C world a Man can't say anything about how a woman has no place fighting in a medieval show, but because I brought it up people say oooh he cant say that he's a pig ...no Im just stating a fact ! get used to it and live with it, you CANT change history..
  I gave the series a good review ,yet people still say it wasn't helpful, don't let your dumb personal feelings about how I mention that they tried to PUSH their feministic viewpoint on the world make you say.oooh it wasn't helpful. thats childish people. This whole women 's rights thing in the drak ages is a shame and it insults what the women really had to go through by ""prettying"" it up by making dumb people think, oooh you see they had as much rights as men did back then!
So let the hate mail flow, lol",1179792000,9,3472,4.193061840120664
2778280,5,B000NQQ4DI,"On BBC One (and, to a certain extent, BBC America), this new ""Robin Hood"" is one of a few ""filler"" shows that collectively help give ""Doctor Who"" a rest between seasons. But ""Robin Hood"" is so good, I wouldn't fight it if someone claimed the reverse.

I watched it because I missed my Christopher Eccleston/David Tennant-Billie Piper fix of action and adventure. I was hooked by the end of the first episode. Like Tennant, Armstrong has so much charisma, it spills out of even the smallest lines.

The Beeb is batting 1000. Snappy. Witty. Fast. Exciting. It's all here. Yes, in the beginning it was hard watching a show where everyone knows the ending, a la Errol Flynn on a spiral staircase, but this show is worth the LOOOONNNGGG middle. It's a post-modern, feminist take on the legend that is--yes, here comes the cliche--modern AND classic. The chemistry between Armstrong and Griffiths cannot be exaggerated. And it actually has themes, such as insider-vs.-outsider, the nature of loyalty, and on and on.

In this Golden Age of Television, ""Robin Hood"" deserves its own seat at the 21st century viewing table.",1177804800,22,1114,4.883597883597884
2778281,5,B000NQQ4DI,"It begins, of course, with Robin of Locksley returning from the Holy Lands having been injured in the service of King Richard. He defends an outlaw and becomes one himself. His land is forfeit to Guy of Gisbourne, who is the Sheriff of Nottingham's right hand man.

The actor who played the Sheriff (Keith Allen) recently appeared on The Brit Awards, a music TV program from London.  The whole crowd was standing and screaming when they saw him.  He truly is a villain who you will love to hate and a worthy opponent for Robin Hood (Jonas Armstrong).  And Lady Marian (Lucy Griffiths) is a strong tough woman who's been defending her people long before Robin Hood came to take up the cause.

This is one of the best versions of the Robin Hood story I have ever seen and believe me, I have seen quite a few.  You've got actors with real Brit accents, real Brit forests--okay and you have the devastating humor thrown in.  The occasional gag on contemporary culture is just too good.

This version is well worth the purchase price and will definitely entertain for years to come.",1177718400,28,1077,4.572916666666667
2778282,4,B000NQQ4DI,"I've always loved the story of Robin Hood and this version is amazing! What's not to like about swordfights and flying arrows, the good guys verses the bad?  The backdrop in which it was filmed is beautiful.  The costumes are amazing.  It's both humorous and serious, and at times it is even both.  It's also quite nice to see Marian (Lucy Griffiths) as a woman who can actually defend and stand up for herself.  And not to forget, but Robin (Jonas Armstrong), and a good portion of his outlaw band, aren't to bad on the eyes...

Overall the first season was amazing, and I can't wait until the next season comes out.",1177545600,3,617,4.464285714285714
2778283,5,B000NQQ4DI,"Robin Hood has become my favorite show, second only to Supernatural.  the coloring is great, the costumes are amazing.  The acting is on point, and the men are gorgeous.  I like that the Sheriff is a jerk and I hate him, but he's really comical.  And the relationship between he and Robin is almost like they really like each other, but aren't allowed to.  Superb.

People giving this show bad reviews need to understand that most of us aren't looking for a history lesson.  We're looking for a show to entertain us, and this does.  I think that whining over the 'modern' look of any show or movie is a waste of time.  We don't want to watch dirty looking people with terrible teeth and horrendous hygene.  I'm not watching Robin Hood to learn about culture back in the early 11th century.  As an archaeologist, I already know the facts, now I want to just watch something fun.",1177200000,6,877,4.487341772151899

While it's not perfect and there are some annoyances (like the obviously fake doll baby in one episode) it's still wonderful. Jonah Armstrong is perfect as Robin Hood, he's cute, sarcastic, and fits the role perfectly. I also enjoy Lucy Griffiths portrayal of Marian, who has phenomenal chemistry with Jonah. All of the cast is great, and the characters work well together that its a really enjoyable show to watch. Even the Sheriff is the epitome of a love-to-hate character because he has all the best funny lines.

Great buy!",1176854400,3,581,4.81
2778286,2,B000NQQ4DI,"In Britain, this series was loudly trumpeted by the British Broadcasting Corporation weeks, months even, in advance of its eventually broadcast. I would like to say that it lives up to its hype, but in all honesty; it is a fair series, enjoyable in an undemanding way, with some rather hard-to-swallow plotlines. Kids will like it, even if they won't lap it up. Keith Allen is great fun as the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham and Jonas Armstrong is a credible Robin Hood.

My main gripe about this series is the absence of Friar Tuck. Judging by other reviews here, I am not the only one. Robin Hood without Tuck is like the Fantastic 4 without The Thing. He is essential, if for nothing else, for a healthy dollop of humour. Tuck is replaced by Djaq, a Muslim girl, who is not only lacking in any humour whatsoever, but seems to have been inserted by the makers of the series to show their liberal credentials. We are reminded every week of how superior Muslim culture is to medieval European culture, how her parents died cruelly at the hands of the Crusaders, and how cleverer she is than the rest of the Merry Men. In other words, she is a sanctimonious pain in the arse. On top of that, I would question the assumptions made by the scriptwriters here. Must I remind them that Robin Hood and his men are supporting Good King Richard who is fighting the Crusades in defence of Christianity? On top of that, Islam had been attacking the borders of Christianity for centuries and would continue to do so for many more centuries? The Crusades are not as black and white as historical revisionists would have us believe.

This series will be forgotten by the time a new series of Robin Hood is commissioned, which I hope will be soon and which will include Friar Tuck.",1176768000,20,1768,4.556603773584905
2778287,4,B000NQQ4DI,"I have been watching this series on BBC America and anticipate each new episode.  This show is geared towards a modern and younger audience, but I think that anyone open-minded enough will enjoy it. It may not be historically accurate, but if you suspend disbelief you will fall in love with the actors and the comical aspects of the show. I am at episode six and the show has found its flow. The first few episodes spend time to set up subplots and characters, and it is worth it.  Marian is wonderful in this version of RH. I think she brings a streghth that really is a good role-model image for younger girls. She can take care of herself and doesn't hesitate to go into action to protect the people around her. The tagline for the show was 'a different kind of hood', BBC means every word. It is new, creative, and better than reality tv.

2778289,4,B000NQQ4DI,"If you want a gritty, truly medieval-looking Robin Hood, you won't find it in this re-imagining. All the elements are in place: Robin Hood, Merry Men, Lady Marian, Sir Guy, the Sheriff of Nottingham. At first the costumes are guaranteed to drive purists crazy. The guys' shirts look like they came from the Sherwood Forest Gap outlet. Sir Guy's leather duster is right out of a Western (though hunky Richard Armitage wears it well). Marian's costumes are mostly unflattering. Then there are the none-too-subtle current Bush-Blair political references. Robin Hood as terrorist? Hmm. Lady Marian as a feminist do-gooder? Okay. Maybe she's meant to be a good role model for girls. Apart from Much and Little John, the actors playing Robin, Will Scarlet, and Alan a Dale are practically interchangeable, all too physically similar for any one to stand out. Both Sir Guy and the Sheriff are far more memorable.

All that said, the series steadily improves from the outset. Once you make up your mind to stop looking for realism, the episodes are fun and entertaining. For a truly imaginative take on the legend, however, check out ""Robin of Sherwood"" with Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley, which is finally available in the U.S. on DVD. Once you've seen Ray Winstone's anger-fueled Will Scarlet, you will pity every actor who has taken on the role since.",1175644800,30,1349,4.942731277533039
