8575921,3,B00BZSULT6,"Like the reviewer listed as ""T. B."" I will say that this still is not ""with concert"" music.  It's a BIG disappointment ....and even if you know nothing about playing old synths it IS definitely obvious that the band are not synched-in to the sound let alone that the soundtrack is very obviously  a Tangerine Dream album release most of us all have.  I give this three stars for one reason alone......the BOOKLET is the original document that came with the concert( the tour program, if you will) , and it is pretty great to see and read.  Also I have to admit the picture quality is very nice too.  BUT still if you are NOT prepared to be watching a ""concept film"" of the band playing at a famous cathedral .....this will disappoint very badly.  Saying that.....I will keep my copy. BUT this may only be a worthy ""Keeper"" if you get it cheap.....and really want that little tour program repro ?  It's your call.....but BE FOREWARNED!",1527120000,,934,4.523809523809524
8575922,2,B00BZSULT6,"This video has been re-issued multiple times and  this edition claims to have the actual concert music from the Coventry cathedral performance.  It does not!...And if the director Tony Palmer ever actually listened to the available recordings of that concert he might realize that he still doesnt have the right music.
Prior editions contained 2 long excerpts from the live album Ricochet which was recorded during this concert tour.

However Ricochet was a composite of multiple excerpts from multiple concerts with studio overdubbing added.

This edition again starts off with an excerpt from Ricochet and then its followed by two long excerpts from the album 1975 album Rubycon.

The actual concert material from the 1975 Coventry cathedral performance Was never recorded for official release but is available as a bootleg and can be heard on YouTube.

  In the promotional material for this addition tony Palmer mistakenly states that Tangerine Dream played Rubicon during this concert performance and that is incorrect...  at that time the technology did not permit the band to replicate album music in a live setting.  Every concert was an improvisation

 Nonetheless if you are a diehard fan of the 1970s lineup in Tangerine Dream this DVD is a must have in one version or another. Just know that it is a video with album music set to it.  It is not a document of a live performance",1516060800,,1389,4.98695652173913

8575924,1,B00BZSULT6,"I guess I could have saved a couple of dollars by checking out the reviews on this thing!  This is just a lot of flashing colors and video of the band and church over Tangerine Dream's recording of Ricochet.  This is NOT a concert video, and it's not even synced music for crying out loud.  Whoever put this together has done a disgrace to a great band and should not be attempting to make money off of this product.  It's going in the garbage, I won't even give anyone the opportunity to view this.",1350086400,6,499,4.276595744680851
