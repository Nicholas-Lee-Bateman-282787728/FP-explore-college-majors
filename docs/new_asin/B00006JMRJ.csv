The story, let's face it, it is not an award winning best movie type of thing but, it is ok. Visually it is very enjoyable, buy it if you have the chance.",1352246400,,247,4.166666666666667
8189884,4,B00006JMRJ,"As far as mech-fighting is concerned, this rather tame, and the storyline is not too great. But it's also not too bad.
The animation is top-notch, the characters are cute and funny, the music is great, and overall this is a decent anime. I was expecting more fan service and was happy that they kept it under control, as it kept the story on a more serious note. Definately worth at least 21.99.",1082419200,,395,4.424657534246576
8189885,3,B00006JMRJ,"This is a pretty good DVD. The animation is crisp and of course, The women are gorgeous. The Feng-Shui thing knocks you a bit off track but all in all its a cute anime to own. The costume design's are fantastic though the brief nudity was too Sailor Moonish for me.",1044576000,4,265,4.215686274509804
