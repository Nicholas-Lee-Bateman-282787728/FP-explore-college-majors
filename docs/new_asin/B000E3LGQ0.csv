8105318,4,B000E3LGQ0,"The Venevision DVD case notes for this Colombian film are hardly fitting for what it contains, since the work is a serious drama that deals with abortion and other grim topics, whereas the box cover exhibits the top-flight talent who perform the leading roles posturing in a generally silly fashion that is indicative of a comedy being in the offing.  This is definitely not a comedic affair, in spite of several elements that showcase whimsy or satire.  The opening scene has Sara (Isabella Santodomingo), a young physician, having sexual intercourse with her husband Juan Jos (Juan Angel) while he is promising that he will not consummate the act in the customary manner, thereby averting a pregnancy that neither participant wants.  However, a loud explosion from a bomb upon a nearby street causes Juanjo to renege and presently Sara is found to be enciente, a condition that causes a full measure of anguish to the pair, due to their (and Colombia's) distressing financial state, one not designed to adequately support a family addition.  Sara's indecisiveness regarding having an abortion is the nucleus of this film, she being additionally troubled by Jeanjo's inability to gain employment, her mother's possibly terminal illness from cancer, and the nation's difficulties with a collapsing economy and turbulent internal strife.  The baby ensconced within her womb is performed (as an adult) by Nicols Montero, he not, understandably, wishing to be terminated before birth.  Athough this is a roughly made work, it is well-acted, and seduces a viewer by the intensity of its narrative flow and engrossing sub-plots.  Perhaps the lightest segments involve the ""baby"", filtered in appropriately misty surroundings, depicting his recourseless desire to be born.  Acting honours go to Helios Fernndez for his able turn as Sara's father, in peril of losing his wife in addition to a grandchild.  Although not so reproduced upon the Venevision box, the true title of the film is COLOMBIANOS, UN ACTO DE FE, subtitled ""Lella Debe O No Hacerlo?"" (Should she or should she not?).  The DVD release provides a number of extra features, including a ""making of"" short, as well as dialogues with writer/director Carlos Fernndez de Soto and other members of the production team.  However, these latter do not offer English language subtitles, a benefit accorded to the majority of the company's inventory of feature films.  Howbeit, little is lost in this instance, as these ""extras"" are not stimulating.  The subtitles for the feature film are generally quite accurate despite wretchedly misleading DVD box liner notes (in both Spanish and English).  This film treats difficult subjects in a convincing manner, framing a careful protocol of realism, dignity, and courage for its leading characters.",1274313600,,2792,5.244943820224719
