8495216,3,B0069AA4YW,"First ever fancam dvd, here's what you get and my thoughts on it.

Tazz vs. Tajiri - ECW Championship - Short but decent match 3/5

Danny Doring vs. CW Anderson - CW Anderson was a new-comer at that time, it was apparent when you hear New York chanting ""Who are you?"" when he came out, although later he would be well known for his work in ECW. And did you see Lita??? Short but solid wrestling match 2/5

Super Crazy vs. Rhino - Very good match, well worth the watch 3/5

Spike Dudley/Balls Mahoney vs. Dudley Boyz - ECW Tag Team Championship Street Fight - I'm not gonna lie it's actually very entertaining to see an ECW street fight via a fancam perspective. Seen lots of great fights between these two teams, and this is one of them 4/5

Uganda vs. Vito - Meh, nothing special

Nova/Chris Chetti vs. FBI vs. Simon Diamond/Tony Devito - 3-Way Dance Tag Team Match - This was originally Little Guido vs. Nova but then Simon Diamond made it a 3-way, then all their tag team partners randomly got involved and it became a 3 way tag team match. Then after the match New Jack came down and it turned into a big ECW brawl. Ah ECW, there's no wrong way to start a brawl lol

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - ECW TV Championship - Certainly not the best match between these two, mostly because of the Impact Players attacking them at the end, throwing the match out, but definetly was a good taste of their legendary matches. 3/5

Dudley Boyz vs. Tommy Dreamer/Raven - ECW Tag Team Championship - Short, this match is more known for the shock value of Raven coming back. 2/5

Positives: Although most of the matches are short they are pretty good, and this episode is legendary since this was the first ECW on TNN episode (officially) and this was the last night we would see the Dudley Boyz in ECW. It's 2 discs and about 3 hours long altogether, so good value too.

Negatives: So much talking! I understand ECW was good with promos, but man there was just too much. There would be anywhere from a 10-20 minute promo between most of the matches, mostly with the dudleyz saying goodbye, and then showing up again . . . and again . . . and again. It was about 90 minutes of just promos and talking which makes me like it less.",1328918400,,2216,4.3180722891566266
