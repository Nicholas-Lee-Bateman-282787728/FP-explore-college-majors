8091631,3,B000BRS64E,"It's true. ""Enter the Devil"" is not included on this dvd, as advertised. The film contained here is ""The Devil's Partner"", filmed in 1958 but not released until 1961 by Filmgroup and stars Ed Nelson and Edgar Buchanan. It's an interesting little b movie that was shown on a double bill with Roger Corman's ""Creature from the Haunted Sea"" and was actually co-written by former Bowery Boy Stanley Clements! While the film was enjoyable, I was looking forward to seeing ""Enter the Devil"", since the other film is available on Mill Creek Entertainment's Tales of Terror 50-movie pack.",1404432000,2,580,4.928571428571429
8091632,2,B000BRS64E,"Warning - the film being packaged under the title of ""Enter the Devil"" isn't the ""Enter the Devil"" (1972) w/Irene Kelly, Josh Bryant as it says it is.",1402963200,,150,4.392857142857143
8091633,1,B000BRS64E,"A word of warning - the film being packaged under the title of Enter the Devil isn't Enter the Devil.  I'm not sure what movie it is (something involving a lone devil-worshipper in black & white), but don't buy this if you're looking to see Enter the Devil.  Something Weird offers a DVD-R of the film on their site as well as Sinister Cinema.",1312416000,4,343,4.34375
