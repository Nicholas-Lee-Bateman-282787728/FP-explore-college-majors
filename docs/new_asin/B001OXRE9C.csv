3736770,5,B001OXRE9C,"I've always loved Mahler's music, but I must admit that the third was not one of my favorites....until I got this DVD.  The performance is just superb! Abbado is one of the truly great interpreters of Mahler and this DVD is a wonderful example. The orchestra, soloist and choruses are outstanding along with the sound and video on the Blu-Ray disc.  I found it truly moving.

Folks, when you finally ""get it"", Mahler's music attains a spiritual quality that I have found no composer can match.  The music can touch your soul, as this performance does. This now has become my favorite Mahler DVD and one of my favorite symphonies.",1259884800,22,629,4.6909090909090905
3736771,5,B001OXRE9C,"I can only second what the other two reviewers have written - this is a truly transcendent recording of one of Mahler's greatest creations. Abbado, his remarkable orchestra, soloist, and choirs simply leave you speechless at the end of the performance. A must have.",1249776000,5,265,5.045454545454546

Abbado''s Lucerne Festival Orchestra is arguably one of the all time best. The players are hand-picked by him for the Lucerne Festival and include soloists, principals from some of the foremost orchestras, and several quartets. They have been meeting for the past number of Lucerne Festivals; and EuroArts has released DVD's of their performances of Mahler''s Symphonies 2, 5, 6 and 7. Now Mahler''s 3rd has just been released.

Much has been written in reviews of the previous releases about this wonderful orchestra which enthusiastically assembles annually. Most of the players know and admire their colleagues, and this certainly comes out in their playing. One reviewer said that they play like a large chamber orchestra. Because I would advise anyone reading this review to get all the previous productions, take the opportunity to read the many glowing reviews of their performances. Therefore I will not reiterate them here. This performance is arguably the best of them all.

I have not experienced all the recordings of Mahler's 3rd, but I am sure that this would be right up there with the very best of those as well. 24 hours after playing this DVD, I can still feel the effects.

Claudio Abbado takes this wonderful orchestra through all the dynamic and tempo changes under great control and pace. There are so many individual solo bits for all of the instruments, that having an orchestra full of such accomplished musicians is an enormous advantage. As with the recording of Mahler''s 2nd, Anna Larsson is the mezzo, and she does a splendid job.

If I have any complaint at all about this production it is that the offstage posthorn player, Hannes Laubin, who seems to have put his soul into his 3rd movement performance, does not get a soloist credit. He does take the curtain calls with Anna Larsson; but for what he has done, he should have more.

The only word I can think of to sum up this performance (and technical production) is TRANSCENDENT.

A must have!!

3736773,5,B001OXRE9C,"First, let me provide a bit of technical information that, at this writing, was not so easy to find:
The format is NTSC 16:1
Sound:  PCM Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1
Subtitles:  D, GB, F, E
Region Code: 0 (Worldwide)
It is a recorded live performance in Lucerne, summer of 2007

(Please bear with me if I get a bit too enthusiastic at times, but this is my favorite performance of my favorite piece of music.)

Gustav Mahler himself once described his third symphony, saying, ""imagine a symphony that embraces the whole universe.""  Now, that may sound presumptuous, or at least overly ambitious, but for Mahler words served only as a signpost to point to the general direction taken by the music.

Mahler's description of this, the largest of all symphonies, seems to follow a plan attempting to outline the history of the earth, mankind, and perhaps the universe.
He refers to the first movement as ""Pan awakes:  summer marches in"" (or perhaps it might be ""life begins"").  The symphony is rather like a musical description of what life is all about, from the very beginning of life.  Succeeding movements in the outline include, ""What the flowers tell me, what animals tell me, what mankind, the angels, and finally what love tells me.

If you're new to the musical world of Mahler, you will encounter all types of musical impressionism.  There are shrieks of small startled animals, grotesque contractions of some gigantic force, flowers wafting in the breeze, a slow and mysterious warning (perhaps it is the voice of Friedrich Nietzsche's Zarathustra) a warning to mankind to Gib Acht--to ""Take Heed,""  sung here piously and passionately to perfection by contralto Anna Larsson.

  In the final two movements, we hear a children's chorus (the Tolzer Boys' Choir) and the Arnold Schoenberg Chor of female voices tell us what the angels tell us, and finally, the last movement reintroduces a theme heard earlier--the ""posthorn serenade"" to proclaim what love tells us.

 The story behind the ""posthorn serenade"" is what inspired Mahler to include an incredibly beautiful posthorn solo in the third movement.  It was the story of the driver of an old post coach, who paused on his nightly run, stopping his coach where the road overlooked a beautiful valley below that he and his now-departed friend had always admired.  The coachman took up his posthorn and played a nostalgic salute to his deeply-missed departed friend.  In the final movement, Mahler builds the posthorn theme into a mighty hymn to the universe, reflecting a sort of harmony of the planets and an oneness with God.

A final comment here is that watching this performance on DVD, allows you to see a rarely used device--the clamping of black cloths over the bells of the trumpets and trombones in the final movement to act as a damper, to reduce the volume without impeding the musicians' ability to hold quieter, sustained notes.

After the last note of this moving symphony, Claudio Abbado and the audience appear truly moved by the grandeur of this music, and more than ten seconds of pensive silence transpire before the applause can no longer be restrained.",1234656000,10,3138,4.9146110056926

8331698,5,B001OXRE9C,"Another wonderful performance by Abbado and his Lucerne Festival Orchestra.  The playing is first-rate, as are all the performances in this series and Abbado delivers another well thought-out interpretation.  But I found the CD put out a few years ago by Salonen and the LA Phil to be just that much more exciting.  I wish that recording had been put out in DVD.  But I added this to my Mahler video collection and am quite pleased to have all Mahler symphonies to watch and listen to in terrific surround sound.  Definitely worth the money!",1371513600,,541,4.712765957446808
8331699,5,B001OXRE9C,"Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This has been further reinforced by his set of performances held at Lucerne with his hand-picked orchestra constituting the Lucerne Festival orchestra. This very large orchestra, apart from containing musicians of outstanding individual abilities, also lays great stress upon their empathy and experience with the world of chamber music. Thus is achieved the unusual combination of orchestral size allied to individual and corporate sensitivity. This suits Abbado's particular vision of Mahler.

In this symphony all these elements come together wonderfully well. The symphony itself is written on a particularly large scale and is in 6 movements, two of which add voices to the orchestral mix. The theme of the symphony is also vast as it contemplates Mahler's view of creation progressing from the `origins of all life' to his view of divinity via `the world of plants ... the animal kingdom ... the world of humans ... the world of angels' as the subject matter of the six movements. (Quotes are from the sleeve notes).

The sound world that Abbado achieves throughout this performance is typified by the final long climax of the work. This maintains an extraordinary translucency of texture as the peak slowly comes into view and is achieved. At no point do the added textures of instrumental colouring obscure anything that is currently present nor do they go on to dominate anything that is yet to be attained. As such this is a perfect example of the whole as a microcosm.

The generously spacious layout of the orchestra and choir allows the camera work to achieve equivalent sensitivity of detail as well as panoramic effect. The surround and stereo sound captures all of this with admirable lucidity.

In my opinion this is a clear contender for the full 5 stars and should give much pleasure and satisfaction to all purchasers of the recording.",1343520000,2,1944,5.065625
8331700,4,B001OXRE9C,"My baptism into the Mahler-on-DVD cycle of symphonies occurred with the No. 9, conducted by Claudio Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra (check it out).  This performance was other-worldly, especially the last moments of the symphony, when Abbado holds the orchestra--and the audience--in quiet suspension for about two minutes before lowering his baton.  So I have been going through all the other Mahler/Abbado/Lucerne DVDs, best served in the Blu-ray format.  A little pricier, but a lot better.  So when I came to the No. 3, I looked forward to its arrival, and was delighted with what I saw and heard.  But two problems loomed.  First of all, there was no ""menu"" at the beginning, just ""Play"" and ""Trailers.""  That was odd . . . . how was I to select the appropriate audio format, and the correct sub-titles for the vocal parts?  On my remote, I found a button for ""sub-titles,"" and sure enough, four language selections popped up on the screen, and I programmed ""English.""  OK so far.  The digital display on my player showed the five-channel spread, but only the three front channels active.  How to program the 5.1 channel surround?  I was getting sound from the rear speakers, but it sounded just like the front speakers.  So I called my local TV expert, and he told me that apparently this DVD was NOT recorded in a surround format, or it would say so somewhere on the DVD container.  Well, I'm not at home, I'm at work, so I'll have to check that later.  Anyway, it is a phenomenal recording, unique in its own way among all the Mahler symphonies: muffled bass drum, muffled trumpets, horns up-raised, off-stage brass, xylophone (only Mahler Symphony with this instrument), children's chorus and also female voices, etc.  For me, for the longest time, this was the least of Mahler's symphonies.  Not any more! And if I am wrong about the audio format, I welcome the correction.  That accounts for the 4 stars, and not 5.

8331701,5,B001OXRE9C,"I'm a loyal Amazon.com customer and always will be.  Their service is exceptional.  However, for whatever reason the SD version of this wonderful performance is not available from them.  To get it new and at a reasonable price, I recommend using the mail order service of J&R Music World in New York City.  I was able to pick up the DVD (Mahler Symphony 3, Abbado, Lucerne Festival Orchestra) from them for $24.98, including postage.  You can google J&R's address and phone number. They're very reliable.  Hopefully, Amazon will eventually make this DVD available in the SD format.",1280880000,3,581,4.938144329896907
8331702,5,B001OXRE9C,"I'd never been exposed to Mahler's music in a serious way until I watched this blu-ray. Wow, what an experience! I didn't expect the 1 hour and 40 minutes could be that joyful and enjoyable. The performance was just flawless and outstanding! I was really impressed by the spirit of the music that was brought by becoming ""ONE"" of the whole orchestra, the soprano, women's choir, boy's choir, and maestro Claudio Abbado. The very last moment when Abbado finishes and pauses, was very touching. Now I'm a crazy fan of Mahler thanks to them and this quality blu-ray. I just hope all the previous concerts of Mahler music, including Boulez's Symphony No. 2 Resurrection, are released in blu-ray in the nearest future.",1277683200,10,713,4.852459016393443
8331703,5,B001OXRE9C,"I was previously unfamiliar with this Symphony but this setting (Lucerne Festival) and this Blu Ray audio and video recording are certainly the best way to present it for the newcomer.  The orchestra is immense yet they play as one and Abbado conducts it all seemingly from memory.  The piece lasts about 98 minutes so that feat alone is remarkable. It will take me many more hearings to fully appreciate it.  The accompanying booklet is pretty sparse on information so I recommend getting the Wikipedia article on this symphony.  I was unable to count all the players to compare with the specified instruments in the Wikipedia article but, for the brass at least, there appear to be 9 horns (8 specified) four trumpets, etc.  It's unusual to see TWO complete sets of timpani.  All these players can produce a very strong, magnificient sound but the occasions where this happens are few, particularly in the last five movements.  There are a lot of very, very soft passages. For these, the video helps because one can see that the player is doing something even if you have to then strain to hear it. The dynamic range of this release is probably the greatest I have ever encountered.  Anyone who likes Mahler, I'm sure, will find this recording highly satisfactory.",1276819200,2,1266,4.8018433179723505
8331704,5,B001OXRE9C,"Mahler's 3rd Symphony is my favourite work of this great composer. A massive work in its conception, this symphony develops in six movements, each movement capturing one particular aspect of Nature or the Universe, starting from the Earth itself (a hymn to god Pan) and progressively moving up through the realms of nature, to the flowers, the animals, man, the angels and finally Love (the sixth movement is one of the most beautiful & important moments of Western music).

I do not have words to describe the beauty either of this music or of the performance. I will only say that I have heard quite a few performances of this work and only few have the subtlety of feeling that Abbado and his Lucerne Festival Orchestra have. There are points where Mahler's exquisite chromatic harmonies could not sound clearer or better than this. Everything is just right, exactly as it should be. The soloists are top-notch, the sound on the DVD good and this is Abbado's masterpiece.

Not to be missed. Also, check out the Boulez recording, which is almost as good.",1268006400,18,1056,4.7967032967032965
