7924525,3,B00004W1T9,"I bought the two disc set on a whim, having never seen it or heard of it before. Although the entire series is only two hours long and there are no special features of any kind on the two DVDs, I was not disappointed with the show itself.
The year is 999 A.D. and the people of Sludgebrook, Englaland (that's how they spell it) are worried that the world will come to an end on New Year's Eve. This is the story of their adventures and mishaps on the last few weeks of the year.
Disc Two contains episodes 4 & 5: Witch and The End of the World.  In these last two installments, a woman in the town is accused of witchcraft when the town's possessions disappear and New Year's Eve comes...and goes.
If you like British Humor (Monty Python and Red Dwarf), check this out. I would suggest buying the set instead of the two individual discs because you'll want to watch them all!",981158400,,875,4.271084337349397
