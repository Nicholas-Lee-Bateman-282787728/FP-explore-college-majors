8023135,2,B00026L7UO,"Shuranosuke Sakaki is a Ronin of the sign of the 4 sickles and sneaks around in a long bright purple robe. Japan has both swords and guns, but guns don't play much of a role. When Mistress Mayu is kidnapped and ransomed for the sword of the Silver Dragon, Sakaki is employed to deliver the sword and rescue the mistress before the Shogun returns. This is an era where Japan is ruled by men with reverse Mohawks.

During the exchange, the sword is stolen by female warriors of the Hojo clan. They have bright orange lanterns. It seems there is a second sword, that of the mythical bird and when you put these swords together you have peace, domination, treasure, or something. Oh yeah. There is a big guy from hell in this who appears to free lancing and a smattering of Christianity awkwardly mixed with Japanese legend. And BTW the guys who hired our hero also want him dead at times so he doesn't talk.

A some point in time, our hero, forces himself on a would-be thief. She of course resists, and then likes it, but afterwards tries to kill him. He then instructs her to ""return to her life as a woman."" Not that Japan is more sexist than the rest of us....",1399593600,,1161,4.37037037037037

8023137,5,B00026L7UO,"A real cool live action samurai film of the anime Sword of Truth. I enjoyed this movie greatly, the sword play was really good.",1355961600,,127,4.333333333333333
8023138,3,B00026L7UO,"First off, let me suggest that as a samurai movie fan since I was a kid in the late 50s, I am dismayed at the evolution of this genre. Granted, there are a few noteworty newer releases like the works of Yamada Yoji as serious plot driven masterpieces and for minimal BS entertainment Gojoe and Shinobi-Heart Under Blade come to mind. The absurdities of modern sword wielding chicks in mini-skirts and silly time/dimension warp plots do not compare with samurai/chambara/jidaigeki classics by old school masters.

That being said, Legend of the Devil surprised me. Granted, there were some ridiculous scenes like for example involving a huge black sumotori that ran amok for no reason and inspired such fear that no one could get a shot off with arrow or bullet. But getting past that, lead actor Kyomoto Masaki, unknown to me previously, had a commanding dark demeanor similar to Ichikawa Raizo as Kyoshiro Nemuri with convincingly powerful and poised sword tekneek reminiscent of the classic masters of cinema swordplay.

Unfortunately, the silly camp which I suppose modern Japanese audiences appreciate affects my review rating. Sets, cinematography, plot flow, dvd quality, & overall feel were enjoyable enuf for me to library for future viewing.",1355097600,,1250,5.152709359605911
8023139,4,B00026L7UO,"LEGEND OF THE DEVILLegend of the Devil is a live action version of Sword for Truth.  It benefits from the extra 30 minutes.  The producers use the extra time to explain who the various factions are and how they are intertwined in the storyline.  The basic plot is the Hojo clans quest to regain two mystical swords which were taken from the clan after they lost a battle.  A demon wants the swords so he can become immortal. A Christian samurai(I know that's a bit of a contradiction in terms) wants them to bring peace to the country to stop persecution of Christians.  Go look up the history of Christianity in Japan.  Sakaki winds caught between all these people.  The actor playing Shuranosuke Sakaki is good.  He has to play an extremely calm, almost Vulcan like character.  I would like to read the original book or books by Takeshi Namuri.",1222473600,,846,4.586666666666667
