8336778,5,B001QX0BKE,Terrific DVD.  Very informative.  I've watched it several times already!,1431302400,,72,6.1
8336779,4,B001QX0BKE,I did not give a perfect score because there are a few spots where the instructor's hands block the camera.  But otherwise it's excellent and wore worth the money!,1377388800,,163,4.620689655172414
8336780,5,B001QX0BKE,"Anything Sharon does is five stars in my world. She speaks plain english and quells any fears you may have in whatever category she addresses. No matter what the subject, you will learn something.....even if you think you know it all",1370131200,,233,4.7073170731707314
8336781,3,B001QX0BKE,"The title of this book fits me perfectly, as I have a lot of experience with other quilting techniques but have long shied away from applique. I ordered the book expecting some in-depth information on technique, but instead, all I got was a short overview, similar to the information included in other, more general, quilting books.
I'm sure the projects in the book would be good practice, but if you're looking for good, hands-on information about how to get started with applique, you're probably better off working with an experienced quilter or taking a class at your friendly local quilt shop.",1320451200,2,599,4.9405940594059405
8336782,5,B001QX0BKE,"I have had the privelege of taking a class from Sharon and was so excited to see her video come out.  It's well worth every penny for the info she has shared, with her sense of humor and relaxing manner.  If you wish to machine quilt, this is an invaluable lesson for you.",1301270400,2,272,4.113207547169812
