8374135,4,B002MXG55W,"Meet Hiroe Ogawa, a healthy sexy woman.  Only one problem...she can't come during sex.  It gets her so upset that she'll try anything to reach her goal.  Fortune tellers, mad scientists, sex crazy lesbians, and more!  Getting help from her friends only add more chaos to the mix too.  Will Hiroe ever find satisfaction?

  At last all three episodes are in English in this very funny soft core sexy anime.  Great voices, bonus art gallery, outtakes, and even comes with the first episode English dub of the VHS release.",1329004800,,519,4.741573033707865
8374136,5,B002MXG55W,"This is an old movie, but a good example of hentai anime done right.  It's the story of a girl, Hiroe Ogawa, who finds it impossible to climax.  Not exactly a new concept for adult movies, but this animated movie twists it in laughable directions.  The ~80-minute movie is split into three episodes.  In Episode 1, Hiroe is using a mechanical device to try to solve her problem when her sister Mayaka walks into the room and ""takes charge"".  She doesn't achieve any greater success with all of the methods she tries, either, until she hypnotizes Hiroe into exploding whenever Mayaka touches her.  This has good results, but Hiroe doesn't yet know that the key is Mayaka's touch.  She can't reach her finish with her boyfriend (and she's starting to get tired of faking it with him), so she asks for Mayaka to find out what's wrong.  They go to a medium and a mad scientist, neither of whom are able to solve her problem.  Finally, Hiroe realizes that the hypnosis means that -only- her sister can do what she needs.  While they're busy at home, their mother hears the commotion and joins them.  In the second and third episodes, they drop the roles for the characters and make Mayaka Hiroe's next-door neighbor, and their mother the landlord.  This is done to hilarious effect because the characters routinely refer to each other as ""Sister"" and ""Mother"", but on-screen text advises that no, they're not -really- related, it's just a boarding house.  The third episode adds demonic possession of Hiroe, and seeing stuffed toys magically merging with other ""toys"" to produce menacing, floating weapons is torturous fun.  Suffice it to say those two episodes share a sense of humor with the first, lampooning traditional Japanese horror movies but with a very dirty bent.  The animation is good, considering that it was made in 1994; the transfer to DVD worked out quite well.  There's not much in the way of extras aside from a silly minute of ""outtakes"" and a few trailers.  There are both English and Japanese audio, and English and Japanese subtitles, so you can choose how to watch.  It's thoroughly an adult anime, though, not for children!",1272153600,5,2144,4.779891304347826
