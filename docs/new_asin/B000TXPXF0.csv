8211423,2,B000TXPXF0,"Very weak film in all respects. The plot is dull, the execution is below average. The best of the package is the cover of the box.",1362268800,,130,4.038461538461538
8211424,1,B000TXPXF0,"I got this movie thinking it would give an idea (or another idea since I've watched a lot of movies) on some major cartel... but really.. this movie is bad.. the acting is OK but man they over did it with the ""hijo de pu*a"" remarks.. it comes to the point where it's annoying... got it cheap there but really not worth your time people...",1338336000,,338,4.2153846153846155
8211425,2,B000TXPXF0,"Don't let the name or the details on the back of the box fool you. It has very little to do with Medellin or the 1980s cocaine empire. Its an alright movie that focuses on petty drug dealing in Colombia and what happens to a honest man who attempts to do business with these petty dealers. You can tell whoever made this movie did not do any research on the criminal world they are trying to portray in this film, Over all its just something to watch when you got nothing else to do. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF MAFIA/GANGSTER FILMS.",1302825600,4,559,4.185185185185185
8211426,1,B000TXPXF0,"It's so easy to work with stereotypes and clichs about the city of Medellin. These help sell books, newspapers, TV shows and even films such as this one.  But that myth of the murder capital of the world,  the drug kingpins and coke covering the hillsides is a myth from 25 years ago, no longer a reality.

It's funny that it's actually some colombian filmmakers who insist on exploiting that dark chapter in the city's history. Move on...",1284595200,5,439,4.602564102564102
8211427,5,B000TXPXF0,"The director has been criticized in the past for only showing the bad face of Colombian society. This movie is not the exception but it is a good mafia story!
The acting is amazing! What impress me the most is that as usual with Gaviria the actors are not professional actors but actual - real life people, many times acting their own life roles.

Great Movie!",1226448000,14,360,4.454545454545454
8211428,5,B000TXPXF0,"""Medelln... sumas y restas"" (Medelln... Addictions and Substractions - 2004) takes you to the 80's, when drug cartels are in complete control of the city of Medellin and its population.  The world of luxury, lust, and power seduce Santiago (Juan Carlos Uribe), a young engineer, as he ventures into the treacherous business of cocaine trafficking.  Within a few weeks, Santiago becomes a wealthy and powerful man with the entire world at his feet.  However, when he comes face-to-face with the true nature of the drug business, Santiago discovers he is trapped in a world of violence where loyalty is traded for money and the consequence of a mistake is death.  Santiago soon finds out that in the extravagant world of cocaine, one loses perspective of what is gained and what is lost.",1190246400,30,785,4.924242424242424
