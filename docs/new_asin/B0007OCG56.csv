2224103,3,B0007OCG56,"It's fitting that James L. Brooks would call his new movie ""Spanglish."" He certainly knows a thing or two about jamming two distinct languages together to make a messy, vivid, wildly popular hybrid.

If you're looking for someone to thank (or blame) for the merging of television and movies into a new, mongrel language, Brooks is your man. He worked first in television, creating the touchstone 1970s sitcoms ""Taxi"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoffs.

In the '80s, he jumped to movies -- a much bigger leap in those days -- winning multiple Oscars his first time out, with ""Terms of Endearment,"" and following up with the hit ""Broadcast News.""

Along the way, he practically invented the dramedy, that audience-pleasing combination of the TV sitcom and the movie tear-jerker that forces you -- even against your will -- to laugh through your tears.

With ""Spanglish,"" his fifth film as writer-director, Brooks produces plenty of laughter and tears. But he does not produce either a coherent, focused story or the sort of complex, full-blooded characters who can take the movie beyond sitcom punch lines and the heartwarming lessons of the ""very special episode.""

Flor (Paz Vega) moves from Mexico to Los Angeles in search of a better life for her daughter, 12-year-old Cristina (Shelbie Bruce). The search leads her to the exotic land of Bel Air, where she takes a job as a housekeeper for the rich, successful, desperately unhappy Clasky family.

Why all the unhappiness? Astonishingly for such a smart writer, Brooks pins the blame on one person: Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni), a neurotic, self-involved woman who is so tightly wound you expect her head to start spinning like Linda Blair's in ""The Exorcist.""

The comparison is not out of line. Deborah is possessed by the competitive, consumerist demons of upper-middle-class America, and they have turned her into a monster who humiliates her children, neglects her husband, betrays those she loves and exercises herself to the point of exhaustion. Leoni, an agile comedian, does her best to make Deborah human, but her writer-director is working against her.

First, Brooks gives her a husband (Adam Sandler) so kind, forgiving and self-effacing even his mother-in-law (the hilarious Cloris Leachman, in the film's best performance) warns Deborah she won't find another man as good as he is.

Then Brooks offers up Deborah's opposite, Flor, who is not only a great mother but also -- as Deborah notices immediately -- absolutely gorgeous.

Brooks puts these three characters, along with Cristina and the Clasky's vulnerable, chubby daughter, Bernice, into a series of sketches that clunk along, without narrative flow, to something of a resolution.

That resolution comes, of course, with a laugh followed by a lump in the throat. After all this time, Brooks knows how to pull those strings. But this time the strings are visible, and you may want to yank back.",1103241600,9,2931,5.060165975103734
2224104,4,B0007OCG56,"I don't particularly love Adam Sandler's comedies. Fortunately, ""Spanglish"" is not one of them! It's more of a James L. Brooks movie. Once again, he writes, directs and produces, as he did with the classic ""Terms of Endearment"" back in 1983, and more recently, with ""As Good as It Gets"".

Sandler plays John Clasky, a renowned chef who is in the prime of his professional career. He's the classic ""good guy"", who loves his family and keeps a great balance between the time he devotes to work and the time with his kids. Plus he loves his insecure wife Deborah, played by Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man), one wacky lady who has put her career on hold to raise her family.

Complementing the cast is Paz Vega, who broke into international stardom playing Lucia in ""Sex and Lucia"". She plays Flor (with rolled ""R"" at the end), a protective Mexican mom who wants to stay as close as possible to her native Mexican values, even while living in the heart of L.A., cleaning and cooking for the Clasky family.

While the plot does lead into some predictable events (don't mean to spoil the story for you), this is not your ""typical"" Adam Sandler movie. As a matter of fact, some of the most hilarious moments are not courtesy of the legend from ""The Wedding Singer"" and Saturday Night Live, but rather the result of the head-on encounter of two cultures, where no side can speak the other's language or easily understand each other's motivations.

With a balance between humor and drama that is preserved throughout most of the plot, the movie stands a good chance of being almost as popular as ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was a back in 2002.",1102896000,39,1641,4.590443686006826
2224105,5,B0007OCG56,This is the best movie of the year. It would be a injustice if you didn't make time to enjoy it.,1102896000,3,96,3.619047619047619
2224106,4,B0007OCG56,"Written and directed by James Brooks, this film (which I saw as a ""sneak preview"") is touching and generally well written, with good acting.  There are funny scenes in the film,  but I felt the dramatic moments were at least as important. The film is a poignant portrayal of several people, and the relationships they have with each other.  Paz Vega is wonderful as a young, single mother, who migrates illegally from Mexico, and settles in Los Angeles.  Her daughter is attracted by ""the better life"" of Anglo America, which leads to some conflicts with her mother.  Vega is employed by the Claskys as a housekeeper, although she doesn't know any English (after six years in the US), and she gradually forms bonds with some of the family members, and conflicts with the neurotic, intrusive wife (played by Ta Leoni).  Adam Sandler is excellent as Leoni's husband--a world-class chef, who loves his family, but is unhappy with his marriage.  I was impressed by his performance, which was real and sensitive.  Cloris Leachman also does fairly well in a supporting role as Leoni's mother, as do two child actresses, Shelbie Bruce and Sarah Steele.  One role that should have been eliminated from the script is that of Sandler's son (whom we never get to know).  An interesting fact is that Vega didn't speak or understand any English when she arrived in LA to play the part, and learned it (as did her character) as the film was shot chronologically.  Great in Pedro Almodovar's  ""Talk to Her, "" the Spanish actress does very well in this drama/comedy.  The script could be a bit tighter, but this is a fine film, and well worth your time and money.",1102723200,10,1647,4.7368421052631575

2224127,2,B0007OCG56,"First of all, no Mexican woman with HALF A BRAIN would smuggle her only daughter across the border with nothing but delusions and desperation in her suitcase. Easily 80-90% of the time they would BOTH be raped within 24 hours, and that's NO JOKE.  Then the woman lands a job for $650 per week without speaking a word of English. That's slightly more than the average U.S. wage in a pool that includes skilled labor, and TRIPLE what she could really expect, which is sub-minimum wage. If this encourages ONE Mexican female to cross the border, the resulting lifetime of misery and regret is on the heads of the producers, cast and crew of this bilge. All that might be forgivable if the picture had any entertainment value whatsoever.  Instead, it's a hypermodern puff piece where every snowflake character feels compelled to ""express"" every neuroses to the Nth degree. Thank gawd for fast forward.",1498176000,2,897,4.818181818181818

2224129,5,B0007OCG56,"I find Spanglish particularly moving because I felt I was watching real people struggle to communicate with one another on so many levels.  Yet there was genuine human emotion on display which I related to deeply.  The way James Brooks was able to tell a love story between two people without making them the focus of most of the movie is truly amazing.  Im not sure I can express in words how much the movie means to me, but Id like to convey how some of my favorite scenes touched me.

The first scene that really grabbed me was when Bernice tried on the new clothes Deborah bought her.  Here we get a taste of each of the major characters in a truly awkward situation.  Bernice is deeply hurt by her mother, Deborah thinks she is motivating Bernice to become a normal weight, and John feels the pain of Bernice - yet somehow is frozen to do anything about it.  All the while Flor is absorbing what has happened not through language, but by sensing the sheer emotion of everyone in the room.

The next scene which really put the movie in motion for me was when Flor confronts John (with Cristina as interpreter) about the money Cristina received for collecting the sea glass.  Flor had already endured having her daughter kidnapped and spoiled by Deborah, and now a lot of money was given to Cristina.  I love how Flor is communicating through her daughter how angry she is, and then John replies to Flor, again through Cristina.  At the same time, I felt there was non-verbal communication occurring directly between Flor and John on a deep level.  The crescendo of the scene is obviously when John reveals how Flors complaint was hypocritical, and Flor agrees with him.  Only then is there a small hint of attraction between John and Flor, and yet its mainly because of the parental connection they feel with their daughters.

Building on their parental connection, we come to the scene where Flor asks to talk with John about the pending enrollment of their girls in private school.  Setting the scene up in a touching way was how Evelyn told Flor she appreciated not being judged.  Flors reaction of understanding and caring was heartwarming.  Then when Flor turns her attention to ask John to talk with her, I found myself routing for Flor and John to make a connection.  Im so glad it played out not as a romantic connection (yet), but again as a deep connection to parenting their children.  It gave me chills when Flor said nothing can change Bernices heart, and John was so grateful to hear someone else say that.  Then John telling Flor she is definitely at a crossroads, and the look in Flors eyes of how touched she was that John really understood her feelings.  Its wonderful how subtle the music was in this scene to begin a hint of romance, with nothing really substantial coming from it.  To witness these two sensitive people finding an emotional bond through mutual concern for their daughters, while trying to resist becoming too attracted to each other, was some incredible writing, acting, and directing.

Finally, the restaurant scene was definitely my favorite.  Seeing Flors eyes and expression when Jon agreed not to drink vodka was only the beginning.  The pure attraction between these two beautiful people is now in full view, yet they are careful not to cross the line.  Sure they have a passionate kiss, and clearly they are enjoying each others company.  My goodness Flor is gorgeous, but they have too much respect for each other and love for their children to take things too far.  When John described Flors looks, it gave me goosebumps to see Flor reacting more to the line all of that, and you're you than his description of her beauty.  I could watch this scene over and over, with amazing acting by both Paz and Adam that went right through me.  I love how there was a delay, accented by sweet music, before Flor told John she loved him.  It just melted my heart, with Johns reaction of amazement and then boom  she has to leave.  Truly magical theater, as I was swept up in feeling the same mixed emotions displayed by the actors themselves.

Wrapping up this masterpiece is a short but tender moment that I didn't totally pick up on the first time I saw the film.  Despite knowing Flor and John could never be together, it was wonderful to see them embrace one final time.  When John doesnt want the moment to end so he says her name, Flor responds with my love in Spanish.  As the saying goes, parting is such sweet sorrow.",1494806400,,4465,4.599241466498103

2224219,5,B0007OCG56,"The most serious roll I've seen Adam Sandler in, this touching little family show has an unprecedented maturity as to parenting and personal virtue. The show addresses the very real issues of fidelity in marriage, class/race division, making mistakes and evaluating opportunities. In addition, it features scenes of hilarity and somberness. The acting is quite good overall--I was particularly impressed by the children actors. And certain scenes should strike a chord with anyone who has ever done interpreting between languages.

On a family note, there were two adjacent scenes that are not family friendly; after reading a newspaper article there is a use of the F-word, and shortly thereafter is a no-nudity sex scene between the husband and wife. While an argument could be made that the sex scene is important to the story because it highlights some of the problems in the relationship between the man and his wife, I felt no qualms about skipping over it.",1409270400,,963,5.094936708860759

The script is a rare gem of wit, insight, and thoughtfulness brought to its full lustre by an ideal cast: Adam Sandler, Paz Vega, Tea Leoni, Cloris Leachman, Shelbie Bruce, and Sarah Steele. It is a unique coming-of-age story, as narrated by the adult version of Shelbie Bruce's character (Aimee Garcia) through her admissions essay to Princeton University. The delicate balance of comedy and drama, of what we are and what we want, of where we come from and where we're going, makes this film a very entertaining 90 minutes spent in the humanities.",1402704000,,619,4.7407407407407405

2224233,4,B0007OCG56,"Adam Sandler's best performance ever!  Subdued and realistic.  This is a comedy and a drama.  It is a film about cultures clashing between a white upper-class family and a Mexican single-mother and her daughter.  The family hires Paz Vegas as a housekeeper (who doesn't speak English...at least at first, but her daughter is fluent).  Tea Leoni is one of those people who wants to integrate the employees into her family and takes the daughter to get her hair colored without even asking the mother.  Paz Vegas, the mother, is trying to instill certain values in her daughter that do not include wasteful, narcissistic actions....which comes into direct conflict with Tea's values.  The result is some wonderful comedy and heart-wrenching drama.  The performances are wonderful, and story is multi-layered and interesting and the direction and pacing is great.  I highly recommend this movie.",1380067200,,892,5.225352112676056

2224236,4,B0007OCG56,"When I first saw the trailers for this film, it struck me as just a lame comedy.  The fact that Adam Sandler appeared in it just reinforced my assumption.

In fact, this film is much more complex than I expected.  There are a few laughs, just as there are in real life, but this film is more about culture clash and family dysfunction.  It transcends easy stereotypes and treats the characters with a measure of respect.

All the actors were great.  Shelbie Bruce, in particular, was a standout performer as the Mexican maid's daughter caught between her native culture and the temptations of the snazzy, glamorous world of her mother's employers.  And it was great to see Adam Sandler play something other than a jerk.

2224238,1,B0007OCG56,"I frequently read reviews on Amazon by people who dislike a movie, give it one reluctant star and say it's the worst movie ever made. They know, and we know, that they haven't seen every movie ever made. The reviewers of the movies I check out on Amazon have certainly avoided the 20% or 30% of the movies at the very bottom of the barrel. All of this is by way of explaining why I will try to avoid such exaggerations.  I can only say, without exaggeration, that ""Spanglish"" is one of the movies I've enjoyed least of any I've ever seen.  The idea is halfway between interesting and cringe-making  -  actually a little closer to cringe-making.  The script is extremely weak - in the way that a beginning improv class would be.  It has a few moments, provided by either Cloris Leachman or Shelby Bruce, who plays Paz Vega's daughter. (I'm not sure if Paz Vega is the B-list Salma Hayek or Salma Hayek is the B-list Paz Vega.) Anyway, the real problem lies elsewhere. As a big fan of Tea Leoni I have to assume that she played the neurotic and abrasive wife just as she was directed to play her. Big mistake.  And as someone who hasn't seen Adam Sandler in any other movies, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he probably couldn't be any worse in anything else. On the other hand, there's no evidence here that he could ever be any better in anything either.  His performance is sloppy, mindless and entirely unsympathetic, oddly enough since his character is supposed to be sympathetic, given the predicament he's in. If I've wasted anyone's time taking so long to tell them how appalling ""Spanglish"" is, at least I can hope that I've saved someone the extreme anguish of watching it.",1375920000,2,1706,4.480645161290322
2224239,1,B0007OCG56,"After finishing watching this film, my immediate reaction was: ""Well, that's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.""
This film fooled me into thinking it was a comedy, when in fact the only laughs came from the completely inappropriate script, the atrocious acting and the ridiculous expressions on Flor's face.
Also, the characters had no substance whatsoever and I was always in perpetual bewilderment at the scene changes. For the most part I had no idea where the characters were and what they were doing.
Adding to this, I have no idea why Flor's daughter viewed Flor as the most influential person in her life. All I could glean from Flor's character was that she was an overly possessive mother who refused to let her daughter grow up any different than to how Flor herself was; consequently I don't believe the film sends across a very good message to mothers OR their daughters.

I don't usually review things, however I felt it was important to ward off any unsuspecting victims who may be tempted to watch this abomination of a film.",1375056000,3,1050,4.706521739130435

2224243,5,B0007OCG56,"I'm late to the party with this movie but I feel ""SPANGLISH"" has become one of my favorites of all time.  It isn't the greatest movie but I found it to be warmhearted, funny and well acted by a fine cast.  It was a good story to introduce one of Spain's national treasures, Paz Vega, to the general public.  Oh yes, very beautiful and quite talented is Paz Vega!

I thought the daughters were well chosen and their characters played an integral part in the plot and tenor of the movie. They filled out this large family including ""chump"" the dog.  Adam Sandler's  right brain/left brain cross talking husband made sense within the nucleus of the story.  The contrasting personalities of the mothers didn't negate the warmth within this ""collective"" family.  It only added to the overall emotional mayhem in the movie.  If you think this is dismissive of a Latin woman trying to learn English, how's your Spanish coming?

A movie that I've enjoyed with multiple viewings.  A keeper that's in my collection for sure.  And WOW, he made a great looking sandwich! :)",1371254400,4,1061,4.675675675675675

2224245,3,B0007OCG56,"Alrighty then, let's start with the positives.  The absolutely stunning Paz Vega steals every single scene she's in; Adam Sandler is (remarkably, astonishingly) subdued and restrained; Tea Leoni plays dysfunction like a seasoned veteran; and Cloris Leachman is priceless.  Sandler plays a world-class, successful chef whose bored and dissatisfied wife (Leoni) hires a gorgeous immigrant from Mexico (Vega) to be the new housekeeper--a housekeeper who doesn't speak a lick of English, and who must communicate to her new employers via her bilingual daughter (Shelbie Bruce).  The plot is multi-layered, to say the least; Bruce's character is drawn to the materialistic, yuppie mom, who virtually ignores her own daughter, a sensitive child with some self-esteem issues (Sarah Steele).  Meanwhile the marriage is disintegrating, augmented by a serious attraction between the chef, and his English-challenged employee.  Throw into this volatile mix a booze-soaked, philosophical mother-in-law (Leachman), and writer/director James Brooks has got some serious potential with SPANGLISH.

And blows it.

The plot comes so close. . .so close. . .to coming together, to gelling, yet ultimately falls short.  Several subplots come close to resolution, only to unravel.  Leoni's character is so unlikable we want the marriage to fail, yet in the end--*SPOILER ALERT!--Sandler and Leoni stay together, with Vega's character--who shares the most poignant moment of the film with Sandler--on the outside looking in, while her daughter is left wanting and unhappy.  SPANGLISH is listed as a comedy, but it's more dramatic than it is humorous, and it's downright sad that it squanders truckloads of potential.

Unfortunately, it is very underrated and a lot of people probably expected a comedy because of Adam Sandler, but this is not the case.  This is definitely a drama, with very few comical scenes.  The character of Flor is what makes this movie a gem.  She is a very elegant, hard-working woman with a high sense of morality and integrity. Her character in comparison with Deborah's wealthy, so-cal mom personality, is very close to reality.  The children also make this film a delight and their performances are superb. The character of Bernice will warm your heart. Adam Sandler also does a great job in this film as a warm, loving, and sensitive father and husband.  The most powerful and moving aspect of this story is the relationship between Cristina and her mother, Flor.  Flor is the kind of woman who will sacrifice everything for her daughter and wants to protect her daughter from becoming a superficial, shallow, teenage girl with no values and priorities. The way Flor raises Cristina is definitely something to be admired and Cristina's respect for her mother is clearly visible and very touching.  The way that Flor devotes herself to her daughter will move you to tears.  The relationship between Flor and Adam Sandler's character will also move you.

This is at best, a mildly annoying, non-funny chick flick, with no real romantic interest and an almost nonexistant plot.  At worst (which is how I experienced it), it is the most boring, uninteresting, sex-less (yes, I don't count the cheesy 30-second, fully clothed dry-humping scene as a ""sex"" scene) piece of theatrical crap I've seen in decades.  Whoever wrote this script should either be run out of the country, or else be banned from writing for life.

Not only is this ""film"" bereft of any artistic value, I would also note that for guys there is nary a breast nor even bare butt in the whole two-hour-plus snooze-fest, to appeal to our prurient interests.  And for the gals, there's absolutely no charisma or true love interest in any of these flat-scripted characters: only boredom and ennui will engulf you.

In short, I've seen 30-second TV commercials with far more entertainment value than this meaningless tripe. Don't rent it, and God help you if you are foolish enough (like me) to buy this complete waste of celluloid.",1290211200,2,1151,4.758793969849246
2224267,3,B0007OCG56,"I'm not going to lay out the fact that James L. Brooks is one of the best film directors to ever walk the planet, because so many others have already pointed that out and really, most complaints directed at `Spanglish' are based on the fact that it just doesn't live up to the reputation that surrounds Brooks.

I came at this from a different approach.

Instead of looking at the director, I came at this looking at the star; Adam Sandler.  Now, Adam and I have a rocky relationship.  His early comedic work, in my opinion, was fresh and exciting (`Happy Gilmore' is still a uproarious ride).  His recent work is repetitive and crude.  He has slivers of greatness achieved, most notably when working with strong co-stars (as was the case in '50 First Dates') but he has recently become the worst part of any film he is in (see the dreadfully conceived `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry').  So, watching `Spanglish' seemed like walking into a trap.

I mean this is Sandler meets Brooks; not a combination for the most fluid offering.

And that is the most disturbing part of `Spanglish', it just doesn't flow.  What starts off like a chaotic comedy that just needs a touch of focus turns, almost too suddenly, into a heartbreaking drama.  I mean, it feels like two very different films.  There needed to be some balance.

Ok, so while I'm laying out faults I'll just spill it all right here.  The initial premise is kind of cheesy in a total `that would never happen, would it' kind of way.  Having the whole story told in a college essay submission seems, at a glance, to be inspired, but it isn't, and the way the essay is closed is rather stupid (and watching a group of adults smiling ridiculously over the essay itself got the film started off on a weird note).  The character development, especially within the relationships, is choppy at best.  John, the perfect husband, is too perfect.  It just doesn't make sense.  Deborah is a total mess, but for me she was the most understandable of the characters.  Sure, she was insane and kind of (or more than kind of) irritating but she was emotionally unstable and remarkably human (especially when the film takes that sudden turn and her performance is required to sell us on everything the script cannot).  For me, I just didn't get Flor.  I mean, I got what she was trying to do with her daughter and I respect the intention, but she came off a tad underdeveloped, and her character is the crux of the entire film.  The relationship that buds between her and John is predictable and annoying.

Oh, and Cloris Leachman is hilarious, even if her character is BEYOND clich&eacute;d and feels like an afterthought.

But, the film has surprising heart.  I loved the character of Bernice.  I mean, she had such depth even if her character was underwritten (Sarah Steele was the star of this show for me).  Tea Leoni was all sorts of manic brilliance here, and the way she sells that sudden scene of destitution was FLAWLESS (in fact, despite being totally out of no where and kind of unbalanced, that scene is the best part of the film and shows so clearly how this film COULD have been had the script been more focused).

It tries, and it succeeds in parts, but the overall feel of `Spanglish' is that it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It tries to hard to sell the `funny' in the beginning and then it tries too hard to sell the `drama' in the end.  It comes off choppy with moments of brilliance masked by layers of missed opportunities.",1288656000,4,3500,4.543130990415335

The dynamics of culture and family relationships were shown very honestly - you could relate to the characters and feel the emotions the characters felt. The movie leaves you feeling sorry for Adam Sandler's character because of his wife's problems. I did feel bad for him in that he was in a difficult marriage with a difficult woman. However, while his wife had an affair - Adam Sandler also seemed to have an emotional affair. I also felt he made it pretty clear he'd be willing to go for an physical affair of his own if given the chance.

He has created two of my favorite comedies (Real Life and Broadcast News) and possibly the best show ever on TV (The Simpsons), but this movie was awful. First of all, the script was hackneyed and the characters were one dimensional. I knew who each character was, and I could see the arc of the entire film, in ten minutes. Second, the directing was ham handed. The reactions shots were lengthy, obvious and terrible. Third, the acting was ATROCIOUS. I have never seen a person try as hard to act neurotic at Tea Leoni. Cloris Leachman as the mom was over-the-top wacky, and the ""fun"" moments suffered the fate of almost all ""fun"" moments in film: you could literally see the quotation marks around ""fun."" Everyone look at how much ""fun"" this is. See my smile? I'm having ""fun"". I'm really ""letting myself go."" Contrasting with this was Adam Sandler, who must have been asked to provide a counterbalance to the neurotic hilarity, so he had his entire face botoxed and got voice lessons from Ben Stein. Wooden.

2224279,4,B0007OCG56,"The movie is based on Christina Moreno, and her mother, Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), who flee Mexico when Christina is six to search for a better life. Flor and her young daughter travel to Los Angeles to live with Flor's cousin, who helps Flor find paying jobs, and an apartment. She lives a life of comfort in a community which clearly mirrors her past life in Mexico. Finally, after years of comfort, she steps out into what they call ""a foreign land"". With the help of her cousin, Flor finds a maid job at the home of John Clasky (Adam Sandler), and his wife Deborah (Tea Leoni). John and Deborah also have two children, Bernice and Georgie, who both seem to have taken a very laid back approach to life, mirroring their father. Also joining the family is Deborah's mother, Evelyn Wright (Cloris Leachman), who takes a back seat to the antics and comes into play at key moments. It seems that at all times, someone in the movie is pulling another person, striving for perfection. Flor is very protective, and very strict with her daughter, attempting to bring her up right besides the fact that Christina has been thrown into this foreign American culture.  While they are living with the Clasky's, Flor begins to realize that the Clasky's and their lifestyle is having a great impact on Christina, and interfering with Flor's attempts at keeping Christina close with her heritage and culture while remaining the only true influence in her daughter's life. The movie culminates at the end with both John and Flor confessing their love for each other, but doing nothing about it. Flor then proceeds to quit her job with the Clasky's severing her ties with the ""outside world"". The movie is mostly based around John, Deborah, Flor, and the struggles they have raising their families in two drastically different ways.

The premise of the story was great; a Mexican maid who speaks no English starts working for a wealthy, white family (husband, wife, daughter and son).  There were some of the usual conflicts you would expect in this situation; miscommunication, etc.  The wife, Mrs Clasky, played by Tea Leoni, was a self-obsessed control freak.  The husband, played by Adam Sandler, was a sweet and weak willed professional and successful chef.  Paz Vega played the Mexican maid, Flor.  She was the best part of the movie.  One of the major conflicts arose with Mrs Clasky taking too much of an interest in Flor's daughter and doing things with her and for her without her mother's permission.  I was quite disappointed with the orgasmic sex scene.  Mr Clasky gets some good news so he and his wife decide to ""celebrate"".  I don't have a problem with that, and I will grant that the scene effectively showed Mrs Clasky's self interest.  Mrs Clasky wore her sport bra (great abs Tea) and Mr Clasky was covered in the right places with a blanket.  But they went bouncing around ""forever"" and Mrs Clasky screamed and grunted herself into exhaustion.  This movie is rated PG-13, not R.  It should have been R.  I had to finally mute it because the scene went on and on.  If not for that sex scene, I would say the movie was okay and would be fun to watch once in a great while.

Adam Sandler plays the homeowner husband who just tries to hold life all together, and is just as grounded as Paz's character.

In fact the whole cast is, especially Sandler's often despicably neurotic wife hwo shows the unabashed affection for the Spanish girl she refuses to lay on her daughter. The Mexican daughter has a marvellous scene interpreting  both languages during a vehement argument at a turning point of the movie. The love chemistry between Sandler and her mum is handled with aplomb and, though both are bitten, they come through admirably.

2224301,4,B0007OCG56,"A lot of good directors will tell you good stories can often fall apart if the casting is bad. There are particular actors and actresses that are not terrible in their respective films but they feel woefully out of place among the talent around them (Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection or Denise Richards in the World is Not Enough). In this case, it's Adam Sandler who actually doesn't even feel miscast. He does a very respectable job at getting away from his Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison schtick but this time instead of being miscast, he just seems like a lightning rod for miscasting rants from people.

The film actually centers around Flor and Cristina, a Spanish mother and daughter respectively who move to California. Flor ends up taking a job as a housekeeper at a really nice house. Only thing is she can't speak any English whatsoever so that causes some initial problems. Things still continue when both of them move in and Cristina finds herself being at a huge center of attention from the wife Deborah. Deborah is shifts moods radically while her husband John is an unhappy restaurant chef, even when he gets a 4 star review. The film mainly centers around different styles of parenting and dysfunction that can happen in families.

Now I should get this out of the way: Sandler doesn't feel miscast, in fact he's quite good, despite some Sandler-esque bits (his dialogue during a rather strange love scene is very reminiscent of his other stuff) but I think his presence suggests this is going to be a low-brow humor geared to frat boys. The real stars are Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, the headstrong but slightly stubborn mother and the wise beyond her years daughter respectively. In fact Bruce steals the show where she not only has to translate a fight with John and Flor but she nails the shifting emotional states of both characters. Tea Leoni I always felt gets really bad reps with stating she's a terrible actress (although her performance in Jurassic Park III made me wish a dinosaur did snack on her) but here I loved her.

The film's main problem is its running time. Ever watch a movie that felt long or was long but looking back on it you couldn't figure out where you'd take the scissors if you had the chance? Spanglish to me is similar in that at 2 hours and 10 minutes it does seem a bit long yet I couldn't tell you what scenes required additional editing since they're important in and of themselves. Not to mention it's not exactly the most cliche-free plot as there's some scenes that are going to be obvious and when they happen they don't really surprise (a possible romance between John and Flor, Deborah and her mother having an all-out or jealousy among Flor and Deborah) but the film's entertaining anyway.

Should you watch the movie? Personally I say so. It's rare lately to watch a good comedy movie that never felt as if all you'd get out of it was laughs.",1163289600,3,2936,4.651252408477842

""Forty messages start to look needy.""

That's from the movie Spanglish, which to my delight is rather more than Just Another Silly Sandler comedy. It's delightful, actually. Sandler is subtle as the cook. Tea Leoni is great as the poster girl for High Strung Wife in SUV. And the kids are awesome.",1162771200,4,468,4.716049382716049
2224303,3,B0007OCG56,"One week last year, my wife and I each picked a romantic comedy as rental fare. Her choice, ""Spanglish"", came first. It wasn't hugely attractive to me--I've never been much of an Adam Sandler fan (excluding Punch Drunk Love, which was a hoot), and Tea Leoni has to answer for her appearance in the awful ""Sudden Impact"". One potential positive was direction by James Brooks, who did Terms of Endearment (which in retrospect was quite similar to Steel Magnolias) about 20 years ago.

I hung in for the entire 130 minutes of this tale of culture clash in Southern California. A Mexican women and her young daughter emigrate to the U.S. After six years working for peanuts in the barrio where everyone speaks Spanish, Flor (the woman) realizes that she needs to enter the Anglo world to find a better paying job, which she finds as a housekeeper for Sandler, Leoni and family. Sandler is a successful chef. Leoni is an achievement-oriented basket case. The Hispanic actress and her daughter are gorgeous. Cloris Leachman has a nice turn as Leoni's mother. The girl who plays the Claskys' daughter is terrific, but I just couldn't get past Sandler and Leoni to really enjoy this film, even though the story has some resonance and wasn't necessarily resolved in the ""happily-ever after"" fashion that you'd expect. The title refers both to the culture clash, and to the housekeeper's belated efforts to learn English, so as to better control the Claskys' influence on her daughter's life.

I think most folks would enjoy this one better than I did (the rest of my family did). As a warning to parents, despite the PG (13) rating there's one clothed, but fairly explicit otherwise, sex scene between the two stars (ride 'em Tea!)",1162512000,5,1722,4.8141891891891895

The movie is also one that also shows how imporatnt it is to be a good parent. John Clasky is also a very good and decent man.

Adam Sandler's wife in this movie is played by Tea Leoni whose nervous energy and fantastic acting brings this complex character to the screen. She plays a typical American woman who had a fantastic carrer and tried to be a mother as well. And as the movie shows that is not an easy task to do both, almost impossible.

The movie is shown and narrated from the point of view of Christina. It is a drama that has humorous moments.

Yes, the overall story  line is a well-worn theme, and I wasn't a fan of the lead (Sandler) or the 2-dimensional wife character.  Fortunately, they merely serve as backdrop for the story on another level that makes it worth watching - the growth and transformation of an immigrant maid and her daughter in a classic American tale that also explores values and character with poignancy and wit.  You care about these people.  It's worth watching alone for the brilliant timing and humor of the ""translation scene"" as daughter translates mother and employer's argument in Spanish and English.  Fresh, funny and satisfying.",1162252800,,713,5.0
2224306,4,B0007OCG56,"Perhaps one of the great travesties of a film like this is the failure in marketing.  James L. Brooks makes serious movies that have a few laughs.  If we zoom in on his past films, we see the heavy detail given to the characters.  Spanglish is a character piece with some very obvious themes.  It's not very funny, but it's not supposed to be.  Fans of Sandler's slapstick comedy may be a bit taken by the understated performance here.  Moreover, they might be surprised by the fact that he isn't the ""star,"" as previews might suggest.  Rather, this is an ensemble piece driven by Paz Vega, who plays a Mexican immigrant who works as a housekeeper for Sandler's family in the film. Vega is brilliant, but Sandler quietly steals the show in a performance that shows his range as an actor.  He's neither comedic, as he is in comedies like ""Big Daddy"" or ""The Wedding Singer,"" or terribly manic, as he was in the quirky comic-drama ""Punch Drunk Love.""  Rather, his performance is understated, honest, and very precise, as a hard-working father trying to find peace within his family.

The film's success relies heavily on how the characters play off each other, especially to Vega, whose entrance into the lives of everyone around her affect them and her.  It is about the communication or lack thereof between the characters.  Brooks brilliantly illustrates that language, in the literal sense, does not neccessarily equate with successful communication.  It's also not the only way to communicate effectively.  Brooks drives the point home in a very moving scene between Sandler and Vega and in the ending that may dissapoint some viewers.  It should at least illicit some discussion.

The film's only failure is only in what people may make it out to be.  It is, in contrast to what many viewers may see, not about the experience of Mexican in a foreign society.  While there are scenes that illustrate the displacement of cultures, the film is more interested in the idea that culture is important in terms of honesty and showing who you truly are.  Some have criticized this film as white washing the Mexican American experience, and while the film is not an ideal illustration, that's not what it intends to be.  These aspects merely serve as a springboard for a film that has much  bigger ideas that speak to a much broader audience, whatever langauge they speak.",1161043200,,2367,4.795061728395062

Even the children were perfectly convivncing.  I hope you get a chance to see the deleted scenes, many of which should have been left in!  Some of them are very funny, and some very touching.  A simple way to state the lesson that this story eloquently expresses, is the difficulty people in families have in communicating with each other, whether they speak the same language or not.

2224311,5,B0007OCG56,"A movie has never touched me so much before until I watched Spanglish. As I put in the DVD into the player, I prepared myself to watch what I thought would be a falt out comedy with Adam Sandler as the star. I was wrong. It was more the character Flor played by Paz Vega that touched me more than anything. Vega is the essence of beauty. Natural beauty with her curly hair brown hair and freckled cheeks and dimple in her chin. I found myself really looking at her. Looking into Flor.

The movie begins with Flor's daughter Crisitna narating an essay she has written to Princeton. She sets up the movie by explaining that her mother is the person she looks up to most. I begin to think that maybe this movie is your usual rags to riches story, but it is so much more. Even as I write this now, I can't help but tear up.

Flor and her daughter are from Mexico. Her husband left her, which in turn has turned her into a strong independent woman. The usual cliche, true. She doesn't show her greif in front of her daughter, and when they decide to move to LA, she tells Christina that one tear is enough to shed. Flor is then hired on as a housekeeper in an upscale neighborhood for an eccentric family. Adam Sandler doesn't come into the picture until at least 20 minutes into the movie. I had almost forgot he was in this movie. I don't know why he was listed first in the credits, and Paz listed third after Tea Leoni (who looks remarkably like Naomi Watts). The whole movie is about Flor.

I can relate so much to Flor. The way she lives through her daughter; wanting what is best for her. Flor claches with Deb, the wife of John (Sandler) in the way two mothers compete for the adoration of their offspring. Deb is a controling manipulative exerholic who gives her attention to Cristina instead of her own daughter who she tossed aside because she isn't as thin as she wants to be. Each mother takes matters into their own hands; Deb taking Cristina out shopping and dying her hair, while Flor lets out the hem of Deb's daughter's new clothes to make her feel special. It is always a battle between the two.

There are a few side stories that play into the plot. John is a chef at a 4 star restaraunt who can not express himself very well, and tends to tune out emotionally fast talkind Deb. Deb on the other hand is secretly having an affair with their realator. All the while, Deb's mother sits in the background spouting off life's wisdom.

Of couse, there are some laugh out loud funny moments. I loved seeing Flor learning English. Hence, Spanglish: A mixture of English and Spanish.

Flor never looses her cool. She a role model for all women out there. Everyone in the family is moved by her. When John tells Deb about the affair, he leaves and takes Flor to his restaraunt. He cooks her dinner and they talk all night. I never knew that food could be so sexual, but in an innocent way. Even when the intimacy steps out of the box breifly, Flor knows when to stop. She would never lower herself to the likes of Deb. She is a ritous woman. It was like in the scene where Deb and Flor are racing down the street. It was like they were racing to see who would win the family. Flor hesitated for one instant, and Deb won. ""It was a good try, "" Deb told Flor. Flor knew after the dinner with John, that she had to quit her job.

Cristina was devistated. She would never see the Clasky family again, or go to their ritzy private school. As Mother and daughter were walking to the bus stop, Cristina yells at her mother saying she ruined her life. Yet, she walks on telling Cristina calmly to come to the bus stop. Flor knows what she is doing is hard, but it is for the best. As Cristina stands there, Flor walks over to her. ""I need some space, "" Cristina says like many of the other characters do throughout the story. ""No, space, "" Flor replies in broken English. ""I am your mother. Don't ever forget who you are.""

This was the most heartwrenching scene. Tears spilled as I watched them get on the bus, sitting in sepreate seats. Then slowly, Cristina moves over next to Flor. The movie ends with the two locked in an embrace and this line:  ""All I know is that I am my mother's daughter.""

I usually toss movies aside when I watch them. Yes, there are some good ones out there, but none that I could hold high on a pedistool. Spanglish is by far one of the best movies of all time.",1152316800,3,4389,4.27710843373494
2224312,1,B0007OCG56,"By the time I managed to finish watching this movie in its entirety -- which I did in two parts because I was so disgusted after the first 30 minutes that I shut the TV off and didn't watch the rest for at least a week -- I was left bewildered and just as disgusted as when I began. To echo another reviewer, nothing was solved at the end of this movie. Like a rollercoaster, it went around in loops and dives and twists and eventually ended up exactly in the same place: nowhere.

Also, right from the beginning I felt I was being manipulated by the filmmakers. They practically planted horns on Deborah (Ta Leoni) and a halo on Flor (Paz Vega). And Adam Sandler's contrived cuteness has finally run its course. I used to get great laughs from his antics, but now he's simply repeating the same part: the hapless, aw-shucks, baby-talking goofball who just wants you to like him, really like him. Adam, stop trying so hard. Please.

Furthermore, this movie reeked of characature and stereotyping. The beautiful, proud, saucy, Mexican cleaning lady. The rich, neurotic, demanding Beverly Hills wife. The poor, hen-pecked, emasculated American husband. The boozy, free-spirited grandma spouting pearls of wisdom. I was insulted by the oversimplifications of both people and situations.

The final straw was at the end when Flor, the aforementioned proud, sexy Mexican woman, decided she was TOO proud to let her daughter embrace American culture to the point of going to a prestigious private school on a scholarship. No, I guess she realized that she perilously crossed the Mexican desert and entered the U.S. illegally so her daughter could hope to slave away at below-minimum-wage jobs because anything more ambitious was spitting on her heritage. Give me a break.

I can't help but think of the very different ending of ""Real Women Have Curves"" where Ana Garcia (America Ferrera) doesn't let her mother keep her trapped in some narrow idea of what she is supposed to be with regard to gender or culture. Instead she goes away to school and finds pride in her own strength and strength in her own pride. I wish ""Spanglish"" had been as inspirational, but in the end all this movie seemed to celebrate was that pig-headedness often prevails. Ol.

Adam is the father who loves  his kids unconditionally, but is unable to stand up for himself when it comes to what he thinks is best for his children. (This was a bit infuriating, but he played it well.)While some of this movie is over the top, you can relate to it because there are parts that remind you of your own family.",1150761600,2,633,4.504347826086956

2224315,2,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish was a movie that had all the elements necessary for a great romantic comedy and didn't live up to its potential. After watching the commercials for it on TV, with the overwight daughter, the alchoholic grandmother and the overall messed up but rich family, I felt the story left much to be desired overall and was incomplete.

The story is narrated to us by Flor's daughter. Despite this, her character is left a blank throughout much of the story, being much more an object than a character. The main character of interest is, of course, the mother. She cannot speak English, however and there aren't any subtitles. Despite this, you imediately sympathise with her and she is much easier to understand than the rest of the cast.

The family poses the largest problem. The father, first presented as a wimpy nice-guys-finish-last type is by the endthe same as when he started. He is so passive throughout the whole film you want to shake some sense into him. But they try to convince you he is perfect. The mother on the other hand is incredibly annoying, and by the end she hasn't changed one jot either. She's superficial, selfish and arrogant. The daughter was wonderful, but the ideas of her being overweight are dumped on you the first half-hour, than she disappears entirely from the story and appears again at the end for five minutes. Her problems have not been resolved either. The boy had nothing to do with anything and the grandmother suddenly says near the end 'I quit drinking a month ago' and that's that.

Ultimately, the story was really about nothing more than a maid who went to work for some people and left. She didn't change their lives. They didn't change theirs. The story may very well not have happened. The only significant change was that of the daughter, which was told more than shown, and the daughter had such little involvement in the story in the first place, you find yourself not really caring.

I did like the themes of sacrificing for your children and staying true to your culture and family. When her loveable daughter started to be become the all-American Valley-girl stereotype I felt truly appaled and was pleased at the way it was all resolved.

In the end, it was an enjoyable movie. Long, but enjoyable. A rediculously large portion of it was spent with the huge fights between Flor and her employers, which was really silly and unneeded. So much was brought into the movie you kept waiting for any sort of resolution, but none ever came. When it ended, you have this feeling of, what was the point? I don't mind open endings, but these were serious oversights and huge plot holes. Why does it matter that he doesn't want his restautrant promoted to a four-star, and then after it gets promoted, he does nothing. Why was that even brough in? It was all very...anti-climactic.

I don't buy the multi-cultural nonsense either, the big deal about the Hispanic daughter losing her culture.  What kind of issue is that?  What kind of moron thought that was a big issue?  Oh hell, you don't want to hang out with Anglos, you don't want to go to a prestigious school, you just want to live in the Barrio.  Oh give me a break.  It's idiocy.  A non-issue for dummies.

2224318,4,B0007OCG56,"I just want to say that Tea Leoni has quickly become one of my favorite actresses.  She has shown in the past two or three years that she has talent I NEVER noticed before.  Anyways, I just wanted to make mention of that while it was on my mind.  Spanglish was a film I had wanted to see but never had the urge to spend money to see, but since the library had it and it was a free rental I picked it up over the weekend.  I just want to say that although it may have not been marketed perfectly, you have to know walking into this film that it is by no means a 'comedy' in the sense that most 'comedies' are today.  It's more along the lines of 'The Family Stone' just not as good.  It's a drama with funny scenes.  The heart of this movie is not to make you laugh but to make you think.  The story revolves around Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a single Latina who is strugling to raise her pre-teen daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in LA.  She gets a job house cleaning for the Clasky family, but she never could have known what she was getting herself or her daughter into.  The Clasky's are not your typical family...their off, just a little.  John (Adam Sandler) is a top-notch chef and the 'sane' one in the family.  Deborah (Leoni) is the high strung, depressed and over whelmed mother who doesn't know how to deal with herself let alone her family.  Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman) is a drunk ex-jazz singer who serves as the reason and also the solution to most of Deborah's problems.  Bernice (Sarah Steele), the overweight daughter, is going through those normal teenage years and is starting to butt heads with her mother enough to loath her for it.  Oh yeah, and they have a son but he never speaks.  As Flor moves in with the Clasky's over the summer the families start to interact in ways neither of them expected and bonds are formed between each and evrey one of them, while walls are built around others.  Writer/director James L. Brooks for the most part gets this very right for he creates people that we care about while painting a picture that is very believable.  The actors, especially Leoni, really sink their teeth into their roles, and Paz is such a warm hearted delight she's such a joy to watch on the screen.  Sandler tackled a role I would have never expected him too and he surprised me by pulling it off.  As I said, this is a dramedy with a lot of heart, a lot of humor and a lot of sincerity.  I'd pick it up, if you haven't already.",1146700800,,2466,4.3058568329718
2224319,3,B0007OCG56,"Perhaps it's Adam Sandler that you want to see in `Spanglish,' James L Brooke's culture-clash drama. Yes, Sandler is surprisingly good with understated acting. He is good enough to make us forget his terrible near career-killing turn in `Little Nicky,' but let me remind you that this film is one of his recent attempts to undo his traditionally accepted image as comedian doing mainly madcap persona. This is not `The Wedding Singer' and it is meant that way.

Young Mexican girl Christina (Shelbie Bruce) recounts how she and her beautiful mother Flor (Paz Vega) arrive at the Clasky Family and their gorgeous house in LA (it's `economy class,' she says), where Flor starts to work as a house keeper for a nervous and obsessive mom Deborah (Tea Leoni). Flor cannot speak English, but the fact is not a big problem among this dysfunctional family - see incredibly patient daddy John (Adam Sandler) first-rate chef so devoted to the family that he cannot say what he should to his nagging wife.

Flor is after all a capable housekeeper, and of very affectionate disposition for that matter, so John is gradually attracted to her while to her dismay her daughter Christie is drawn to the rich life of the Clansky Family. Though the film gives some interesting supports, especially from deliciously off-beat comic performance as a retired jazz singer from Cloris Leechan, the budding romance between Sandler and Vega lacks chemistry, and is concluded with unconvincing ending.

I know this is a matter of taste, but I found Tea Leoni's acting as the frivolous, self-obsessed mom interesting at first, but her constant one-note yelling and mugging gradually became annoying and irritating as the story went on. The character played by Leoni, who is better in recent `Fun with Dick and Jane,' gets alarmingly close to being monstrous.

But if something or somebody should be praised for her freshness, naturalness, and most of all, radiating charms, Paz Vega should be the real star of `Spanglsih,' which, though well-intentioned and sporadically funny, is curiously devoid of the originality, or the quirky charms of the characters Brooks has been good at creating. The film is largely well-acted, and also amusing enough thanks to some of the one-liners, but everything about the characters looks oversimplified.

2224321,5,B0007OCG56,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I loved the characters and thought that the movie captured perfectly some of the relationship pitfalls that exist between family members and employer/employees.

Tea Leone is perfectly scary as the obsessive-compulsive, competative, spoiled wife who does not have a warm relationship with anyone in the movie, including her husband.  She has very little to do with her own children, but becomes obsessed with her housekeepers daughter because she is so beautiful.  There is a telling scene where she purchases her daughter Bernice bags of new clothing.  Bernice is elated until she realizes that all of the clothes are too small and her mother tells her that they'll all fit when she loses a little weight.

Adam Sandler is a great surprise here in a dramatic, rather than comedic, role as a chef/restauranteur.  He has complicated employee relationships (a sous chef who wants part ownership in the restaurant, an agressive manager who wants to change the feeling of the restaurant) and home relationships.  When Flor arrives he is taken by her but this doesn't get too complicated until his wife insists that Flor and her daughter move into the Malibu summer house with them.

Flor is a very attentive and focused mother.  She takes the job with the Clasky's because she wants more time in the evenings with her daughter and needs to make more money.  This is her first move out of the hispanic community she has enjoyed since moving to the U.S.  She resists the Clasky's efforts to ""help"" her daughter and this becomes a full out war of wills between her and Mrs. Clasky, though Mr. Clasky un-wittingly puts himself into it as well.  Flor is a determined character, probably the best one in the film, she is a fierce mother and seems to have her priorities intact.

The relationship between Flor and Mr. Clasky is, I thought, one of the most natural in the movie.  Of course he is attracted to the beautiful maid but as the movie goes on you find that they appreciate each other for their ideals, not thier looks.  In the end the relationship goes nowhere, because it shouldn't and they are both wise enough to know that.  In contrast, Mrs. Clasky is carrying on with her real estate agent and thinks all will be forgiven.

Cloris Leachman is wonderful as Mrs. Clasky's live in mother.  She provides most of the comic releif in this movie.

This movie is not making a serious racial statement like Crash and it's not funny like some of Sandler's other films but it is an entertaining dramatic film that says a lot about family.",1143331200,3,2573,4.752252252252252
2224322,5,B0007OCG56,"This is not an Adam Sandler comedy, so don't get this if that is want you want to see.

This is Adam Sandler's first time playing a real adult, a role most Hollywood actors never play.  The theme is responsible parenting.

If you have ever lived in Hollywood, as we once did, then you can  get a lot of laughs out of Tia Leoni's great comedic performance as a New Age Hollywood wife, and a solid supporting performance by Cloris Leachman.  But the jokes are insider baseball at Hollywood's expense.

The plot has a few flaws; but it is so unusual to see a couple of grownups in any Hollywood movie lately, that for true movie fans who like really good movies, this is one you shouldn't miss.",1142899200,2,691,4.359375

If this had just been a movie about a Mom from Mexico trying to deal with raising her daughter in the US, it would have been great.  The performances by Mother and daughter, Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, were excellent.

The most unbelievable part of the film was that the audience is supposed to believe that Adam Sandler's character, a chef and restaurant owner in LOS ANGELES, speaks not a word of Spanish!  Not a chance in real life.  Who do you think is working in the kitchens in these fancy restaurants?  Spanish speaking employees.",1142726400,6,648,4.75
2224324,5,B0007OCG56,"Take an emotinally unstable over-achiever mother

Add a drunken mom . . .

An Insecure Cook with heart . . .

and a no-english speaking spanish  maid and you got yourself a fresh comedy in the tradition of AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Written by the same man who directed AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

This Dramedy acomplishes what so few have tried. A little taste of how embarassing it is to not know a language.

But this one movie has heart. Adam Sandler flexes his dramatic funny bone here and leaves room for the others to develop.

the whole movie is told through the eyes of the maid's daughter via an essay to a college that she wants to go to where she tells the story of how her mother had trouble adapting to one family's life style.

Adam sandler plays the sympathetic Father who is all for making his children happy. He recently transferred from a high 4 star resturant to a lower class one. But, after the mom realizes that she can't handle everything around the house, she decides to hire a maid. The maid knows only a little bit of english . . . which is a classic tool for comedy. The comedy of Misunderstanding someone.

After repeated problems, and under control of the nutso mom, adam sandler's character shines and is able to rise above the rest, even having a touching scene with the maid.

The dvd has some special features but the one that really gets the taste buds tingling is a way to make THE WORLD'S GREATEST SANDWHICH. The sandwhich that adam sandler eats in the film. He was taught how to make it by a chef who was training him on the film.

Final Verdict: Lives up to AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Should really be called - IT GETS EVEN BETTER!

However, the true story here is boy meets girl and the heart-wrenching truth behind these kinds of stories in the real world--things don't always work out for the best.

The cast was excellent and by the end, those who understood the underlying themes of the film have grown attached to Sandler and Vega's characters and their struggles.  These are two individuals trying to do all the right things for the ones they love regardless of their own happiness.  That is what makes the ending all the more tragic.

Caring people exist out there who together would find amazing happiness.  Unfortunately, the responsibilities of life and the committment to following socially acceptable paths to fulfillment leave potential soul mates alone and unfulfilled.

Content yourselves with this folks: he could've ruined the race-and-class issues inherent in a film like this, the way ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Crash"" butchered race issues and ""Maid in Manhattan"" butchered class/ethnic issues.

That said: great acting, great morality play.

Acting. Shelbie Bruce as Cristina Moreno stole the show.  The simultaneous translation provided in the confrontation between Flor Morenoa and John Clasky is a classic.  Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler, and known quantity whether you like him or not.  I like him.  Tea Leoni: loved her every since the short-lived Fox sitcom ""Flying Blind.""  I guess that dates me.  She gives 110% and plays her role at 110%, just below the caricature of an Anglo housewife-overachiever.  Sarah Steele was very good as well.

Morality play.  Any film whose moral basis is strength in the face of adversity is OK by me, and very refreshing.  The film makes this point time and time again: the flight to Mexico, Flor's decision to devote time to Cristina, returning money for fear of its corrupting influence, non-consummation of a desired relationship because of marriage commitment.  All these themes are worked in to Spanglish with wit and grace.",1138406400,3,1385,5.044052863436123
2224329,2,B0007OCG56,"Despite Adam Sandler's top billing, the stars of the movie are Vega and Leoni with strong support from Leachman and the 2 daughters. The couple's son is almost invisible while the 2 daughters are heavily featured.
Leoni plays a very high maintenance wife to Sandler's reserved husband. They decide to hire a Mexican nanny/housekeeper who doesn't speak any English (Vega). Sandler and Leoni and their family speak zero Spanish. This is real sore point- if you live in a city where millions of people speak English and Spanish and your job requires that you deal with the public, you will have
at least acquired some basic words of the other language. Not these people- not even amigo, adios, vamos, si from the American couple or goodbye, hello, yes from the Mexican housekeeper.
Despite Sandler's presence, there is virtually no humor in the movie. So in that respect, it's just like an Adam Sandler comedy.
The focus of the filmis a brief period of a few months in these character's lives then it fast forwards a number of years to the point where one of the girls is off to college. Vega's daughter is writing a letter to Princeton University explaining why her mother is so special but what she apparently writes is a 2 hour letter on a 3 month period and nothing on any of the years that follow. So much for realism.

2224331,2,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish really disappointed me. The acting was fantastic all the way through.  And the plot could have been as great as the acting was if only Brooks hadn't written it with such a raging hard on and a guilty concience.  The real focus of the plot is that of a white married man's crush on the Mexican, family maid. Touchy subject, but that's why it could have been rife with realism and tension. C'mon, it is not difficult to understand why a beautiful, exotic woman thrown into the home of an unhappy marriage might cause the man to feel divided and excited. What is difficult to understand, however, is how a married relationship can overcome this event.

  Unfortunately, one half of the plot is spent trying to convince us that Mr. Clascy is a good guy and the other half drooling, ad nauseum , over what a virtuous madonna, Flor, the maid is. (kinda racist, no?) The plucky bit with the daughter writing about her mom sticks out as a red herring. Don't be fooled: This is not a family film! It is a complete downer dedicated to masterbating over the unattainable.

  Which is why it's unbeleivable that Flor should be attracted to Mr. Clascy. Not that Adam Sandler isn't charming, it's just that it comes as a shock to see a character who has only been depicted as a saint suddenly acting like a human during a greuling, almost love scene.

  The greatest failure of Spanglish is that the wife is oh so conveniently demonized right when she should be redeemed. Mrs. Clascy's neurosis, caused by white American life, is an interesting contrast to the merits of Flor. But since her much needed character developement is all but forfeited in favor of bolstering more excuse for Mr. Clascy's emotional affair the plot becomes too imbalanced to acheive poignance. The sensitivity found in Sideways, American Beauty, and the Icicle Storm is not present in Spanglish. What the audience needed was to understand the flaws of each character enough to have sympathy for them. No sympathy for Mrs. Clascy means we feel no concern for the marriage. So, what is binding Mr. Clascy to the marriage? Brooks point is that there is only duty. What a downer!",1137628800,6,2147,4.683510638297872
2224332,4,B0007OCG56,"This movie surprised me in a couple great ways.

The first surprise was Adam Sandler.  In all the previous roles that I've seen or heard about, he's been a goof off and slightly crazy.  He was very serious in this role and he did a great job at it too.  There were moments with his daughter that made me want to cry because he was so sensitive to her feelings, unlike his wife, her mother.

The second surprise for me came in the fact that from the advertising for the movie, I thought that it was going to be a little different.  The movie focused on the houskeeper and her daughter, and not the family, as I had thought it would.  I loved the fact that the daughter narrated through her college application essay.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of five, was that there were a few times later in the movie when it seemed to drag a bit.

All in all this movie was very touching and showed that the father is not always the ""bad guy"".  It showed that you have to be yourself and not try to be what other people think you should be.",1136851200,,1043,4.118811881188119

Each character is a type rather than a person. None is developed. One leaves the movie exceedingly grateful that caricatures such as these (the husband and wife, both of whom are half-witted or addle-pated)do not inhabit one's world.

The film is poorly written, execrably acted (except for the Mexican contingent and the banshee's daughter) and directed, wretchedly edited, and a sorry excuse for entertainment.

2224337,4,B0007OCG56,"I must admit that it took a little while for ""Spanglish"" to completely win me over - but win me over it did thanks to its sharply observed social commentary and winning performances by a first-rate cast.  At first, the film threatens to be swept away by a tidal wave of stereotypical characters and cliches, but it doesn't take long for the subtleties and complexities to kick in and to lift the movie to a higher level.

This is James L. Brooks' witty take on the cultural divide that separates the ""master class"" from the ""servant class"" in multi-ethnic Los Angeles.  The Hispanic side of the equation is represented by Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a gorgeous single mother living in Mexico who heads to America to start a new life for herself and her daughter.  Eventually, despite the fact that she cannot speak English, Flor finds a job as a fulltime housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy white family named the Claskys.  The wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a deeply neurotic limousine liberal who drives her family crazy with her obsessive compulsiveness and lack of a clear mental focus.  Her husband, John, is a mild-mannered master chef who has become completely exasperated by the intensely mercurial nature of his wife's behavior and moods, and who yearns for nothing more than a little peace and harmony on the home front.  The Claskys also have a sweet-tempered but homely daughter, Bernice, who bonds with Flor's beautiful daughter, Christina, who narrates the tale.

What distinguishes ""Spanglish"" from so many other American comedies is its staunch refusal to adhere to a cookie-cutter formula.  Brooks has written a screenplay that allows the characters room to breathe and to interact with one another in complex and surprising ways.  He doesn't even feel the need to tie up all the loose ends in the closing minutes.  He is perfectly willing to let the characters continue to live their lives even after the closing credits have scrolled by.  What he captures best is the subtle tug-of-war that develops between the two mothers over their respective daughters, particularly Deborah's intense devotion to Christina, which seems partly a result of a genuine desire to help her get ahead in life, and partly an unconscious preference for this beautiful child over her own overweight daughter.  Brooks understands the sore spots inherent in parent/child interactions as well as relationships in general.  Naturally, a romantic attraction eventually develops between John and Flor, but one that is handled with charm, delicacy and tact.

Sandler and Vega give warmth, touching performances, and Shelbie Bruce, Sarah Steele and Cloris Leachman offer superb support.  Leoni starts off so over-the-top that one fears she will throw the entire movie off-kilter.  But damned if she doesn't grow on you, as she turns what could have been a psychological gargoyle into a sympathetic woman filled with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.

Happily, the humor in the film arises naturally from the characters and situations and almost never feels desperate or forced.  And, indeed, there are some very hearty laughs generously laced throughout the movie.

""Spanglish' doesn't try to ""solve"" the ethnic and race relations problems that still plague America's largest cities.  However, in its own quiet, humor-filled way, it reminds us that the caste system is still very much a reality in a country that prides itself on its supposed lack of class-consciousness.",1135987200,,3459,5.108348134991119
2224338,2,B0007OCG56,"This movie is advertised as a comedy, and it isn't one.  The plot, or the lack of it, is silly.  The movie is told from an essay, an essay Flor's daughter writes.

The script is bad too.  One part in the movie, Leoni (who plays the wife of Sandler) hires a woman (Paz) to work in her house when the woman speaks absolutely no English and has a complete language barrier?  It makes no sense.

These immigrants are all faced with a simple yet difficult question:  How much should they assymilate, and how much of their own culture should they retain?

Flor (Paz Vega) is James L. Brooks' (director of As Good As it Gets) realistic portrayal of a Mexican woman, abandoned by her husband, seeking survival for herself and her daughter through emmigrating to the United States.  After six years of working two jobs in Los Angeles, Flor is forced to look for a single job to provide her with the money she needs and the time she needs to spend with her daughter.  She finds this job in the affluent Clasky home, as a housekeeper.  And this is where the cultures begin to clash in a very amusing, yet true to life manner.  And, it is here that Flor, and her young daughter, are faced with the question of identity.

Sub-stories add depth and credibility to Spanglish.  The collapsing marriage of four star chef/restaurant owner John and neurotic recently unemployed Deborah Clasky (Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni), and the alcoholim of Deborah's mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) just skim the surface of the sub-plots in this film.  Deborah's constant stuggle for attention isolates her from her family, and her need for perfection drives her lonely, overweight daughter, Bernice, further away.  Bernice buckles at times under the pressure of unrealistic standards placed upon her by her mother, especially when Flor's seemingly perfect daugher, Cristina enters her life.  John, drained from his wife's persistant neediness, eventually turns to Flor for comfort.

Throughout the entire movie, Flor's actions, and choices to refrain from action, are a direct result of her placing the needs of her daughter ahead of her own.  Even as the relationship between them is undermined by manipulative Deborah Clasky, Flor continues to live her life for her daughter.

The truth is that we have an ever growing conflict between the Mexican movement and the estamishment that is American.  We say to people welcome and reap the rewards of becoming part of the American community. But what we hear in return is, ""Thanks, but no thanks. We'll gladly take what ever we can get from America but we don't what to be held to your standards"".
And in the ending we apperantly hear that loud and clear - It is more important to stay true to your nationality than it is to allow the offspring to advance in away that can only be done by embraceing America mind, heart and soul.

2224346,4,B0007OCG56,"This unusual film is surprisingly entertaining, much more interesting than its advertising would suggest. The story is a familiar one, need vs. plenty, as a young mother and her daughter emigrate from Mexico, crossing the border illegally in hopes of a better life. Flor (Paz Vega) is hired to work as a domestic in a wealthy household, although she speaks not a word of English. John Clasky (Adam Sandler) is an award-winning chef, who provides a lifestyle for his wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni) and daughter that includes a Malibu beach house for the summer. Flor is induced to live at the Malibu home and care for the family when it is suggested that her daughter, Christina (Victoria Luna) come along. Flor finds her parenting challenged at every point by a spoiled and insensitive Deborah, a self-centered fitness junkie with a penchant for talking her family into submission.

Without a trace of subtlety, Deborah confronts her daughter's weight problem, under the guise of what is best for the girl, her husband chagrined by his wife's lack of sensitivity, but basically ineffective in the family dynamic. Turning to the lively and lovely Christina, Deborah smothers the child with opportunities that would otherwise be denied her, Deborah oblivious to anyone's needs but her own. Frustrated and hampered by the language barrier, understanding instinctively that she will need every tool available to offset Christina's growing ease with privilege and access, Flor takes a crash course in English. A determined Flor fights for her own territory and in the process wins the affection of the largely ignored John. Meanwhile Deborah pursues her own interests at the risk of her happy, if dysfunctional home. It would be easy to imagine the outcome of this domestic drama, but director James L. Brooks avoids the predictable, delivering a thought-provoking ending that gives a welcome twist to the immigrant issue.

Paz Vega (Flor) and Victoria Luna (Christina) provide the emotional core of this film, with engaging support from Sandler and Sarah Steele, as his daughter, Bernice. Vega shines on the screen, her acting a luminous antidote to the over-the-top Leoni, who ties herself into such an emotional knot that she becomes a parody of the self-indulgent over-privileged. For all her emotional gymnastics, Leoni never comes close to Vega, whose role is all the more powerful for its understatement. Luan Gaines/ 2005.",1132272000,,2420,5.170918367346939

Her wildness and seemingly ego-centric actions only point out how desparate she is to get out of her situation.  She sees no value in being a wife and mother.  John Clasky, played brilliantly by Adam Sandler, is a man lost in his own story of success and failure.  Flor and Cristina only walk into this mess of a family, by accident.  It is Flor's balance and strong sense of self that begins to have an effect on the loose cannons residing in the Clasky household, save Deb.  Bernie, the daughter, finds a true heart in Flor - like her own.  The grandmother finds an interest in helping out her grandkids, which in turn, helps her to stop boozing.  John finds the very thing that's been missing in his relationship with Deb.  He finds a woman who knows and loves a sensitive soul when she sees one.  Flor truly is John's soul to soul connection.  Deb, well, she needs to go be important again.  If I had to write a sequel, then John and Flor would be together with grandma and kids living as a warm, happy, and intelligent family.

1.  Much overlooked in the most thoughtful and sweet person in the movie in Tea Leoni's character, despite her enlarged-for-TV foibles (and no girlfriends to air them with.  Very curious Hollywood oversight: a rich American woman living in Malibu with no friends...even false ones??). Yet she strives to be good in her own ways.  a. She hires a maid with no experience who doesn't even speak English, and then pays her handsomely (lest we forget her beauty was obvious and would have tempted the husband).  b. she takes the maid's daughter out for a girl's day and treats her to the chagrin of the maid  c. She helps the maid's daughter get a scholarship and tries to assimilate her into their family circle.

2.  Adam Sandler's character never empathised with his wife's neurotic condition and just brushed her off, unless sex was involved.  Then during the act, he quips a turn off comment: ""You don't even need me (to orgasm) do you?"" hurting her feelings.  Of course he has lustful eyes for the help since their 1st meeting.  Bum.

3.  Worst of all, Paz Vega (Flor).  What an ungrateful, slutty, needy character!  She coyly makes Tea Leoni out to be the bad seed and is a lousy housekeeper (anybody notice the patio was always a mess while she was busy learning her English tapes?)  She sexually teases Adam Sandler, always lingering a little too long for comfort with her pretentiously shy behaviour (yeah why'd she pull him away to a quiet part of the beach at night to talk?)  To top it off she didn't want her daughter to succeed, but rather to live out a slum existence with her so she wouldn't die of lonliness.  She makes her give up her scholarship for no good reason, not wanting better for her kid.  Saddest part of all was the daughter giving up so soon.  She miraculously cheered up on the way home in the bus.  What a lousy, feel bad comedy!",1131926400,15,1920,4.539358600583091

Amidst the well written comedy scenes, there are many LIFE-IMPACTING conversations. If you pay attention to this movie, I think you will learn something about yourself, about cultural differences, about responsibility...all while having a few good laughs and a good time. (I know I sound like corney Dr. Phil). Go see this movie, I think Paz Vega is a stand out in her first big Hollywood appearance. her character could have lighten up she said no to just about anything, she won't let her daughter have $50, won't let her go to private school, she quite her job and moved out of the lovely house, she rejected Adam ""which was stupid"". Mrs. Leoni overacts and become quit bothersome. She's probable a CRACK-HEAD or RETARTED!

2224352,3,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni among others.  It is the story of a California family that hires a Mexican cleaning lady with no knowledge of English that uses her daughter as an interpreter.  The more time she spends with the family the more she finds out about the problems they are facing.  Consequently, she becomes fond of her employers and wishes to help them bridge their differences, until she falls in love with the man of the family and the woman of the family falls in love with her daughter....

In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great, with the exception of Tea Leoni who does a wonderful job of portraying the psychotic wife), while the dialogues and the plot are just average.

The characters are, overall, weak, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. the alcoholic mother in law and the two kids)

Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

Nevertheless, it should be noted that Paz Vega's potential to make it big in Hollywood is definitely there.

In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.

The movie does a good job of developing Tea's character as the psychotic wife. The viewer gets a fuller and fuller picture of her dysfuntionality as the movie goes on. However, her personality is all over the map and it is hard to get a good picture of her. Adam Sandler's character works as the super nice husband. The maid character is supposed to be sane, but never really works out that way. The daughter of the maid's voice over is really confusing sometimes and I don't think it helps much at all.

The Real Plot: Adam Sandler goofs around for about two hours, then makes fun of his fat daughter then trys to grope the mailman.

I thought the plot sucked. I hate the part when adam sandler wets himself, then crys and yells into the corner about how chris rock always got the best movie parts and how head of state was his idea. That part was kinda of depressing. Then there's other parts where i question the filmakers intenions. Like the part where Sandler runs into the middle of traffic and grabs his guitar and starts to sing the haunaka song part 3, then starts to make weird noises. Then he goes and falls into a river and yells at himslef for making 8 crazy nights.

And that's just in the first hour.

This is a surprisingly wonderful glimpse into the life of a family where two cultures collide.  The story here is about life, and love, and committment.  But mostly it's a story of a mother and her daughter, with a little shot of another typical white upper middle class family who outwardly appear successful but inwardly everything is much like roses, beautiful but with thorns.  Adam Sandler is stunning here not as a comedian, but with just enough humor in his role to make this his coup de grace peformance.

Flor (Paz Vega) is a wonderful housekeeper.  She's warm, loving and caring ... and of course, beautiful. This IS Hollywood! Her daughter is also all of the above and the ""lady of the house"", Deborah (Tea Leoni) likes her a lot. She spoils her without her mother's approval. However, Deborah also arranges for the daughter to go to a good school on a scholarship. At the end of the movie, Flor quits her job and insists her daughter leave the school, despite Deborah and her spineless husband insisting that she stays.  The daughter gets upset about this, thinking of her future of course. Flor utters ""wise"" words stating that the daughter seems unimpressed that she might end up like her mother one day and is she ashamed? The daughter whole-heartedly accepts this as gospel.

Hello?!?

Flor is a gorgeous woman who has done well with herself as an illegal immigrant, but hey - is there anything wrong with grabbing the chance to excel beyond housekeeper?!  Has that got anything to do with being ashamed of your mother?! Nada.

I found that message quite ordinary and I ended up wanting to punch that sweet Flor. It completely ruined the movie for me.",1124064000,7,1273,4.754545454545455
2224360,4,B0007OCG56,"I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan so much I could quote every line from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy for much of the late 90's. Going into the new millennium, Sandler seem to not be able to decide whether to stick with his sophomoric shtick as with Little Nicky or move into a more sophisticated style as he did in Punch Drunk Love. And of course there is always romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. His latest trek into the sophisticated realm was Spanglish.

The backdrop of the film is an essay a student has written for her application to Yale. It explains why her mother is the person she most admires and goes on to explain how her mom took her from Mexico and made her the person she was today. The problem with this is that the movie then doesn't revolve around the young girl yet focuses on the family he mother began to work for upon arriving in America. In fact the girl gets very little screen time in the movie. The family includes Sandler as the dad with an inferiority complex at being the best chef in the country, his wife, played by Ta Leoni, a victim of downsizing who can quite adapt to being a stay at home mom. They have two children, a son who barely makes blip on screen and an overweight daughter played by an actress who tries to pull off the ""wise beyond her age"" act but isn't able to do so. Alcoholic grandma also lives with them played perfectly by Cloris Leachman who delivers the best line in the movie, ""Honey, lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense."" That line has entered into my repertoire of insults and can't wait until I find the perfect time to unleash it.

The movie finally hit its stride when the family movies to a beach house for the summer when Sandler's family is introduced to the Mexican girl who is forced to move in with them due to distance reasons. Leoni finds in her the daughter she always wanted which causes problem with basically everyone else in the film.

The film is well written finding a balance in-between drama and comedy and also features what was one of the most disturbing sex scenes I have seen in a while. If that ever happen to me, I may have to give up sex for a while. As for the negatives, the movie seems to forget that is it based on an essay and there are many things that I doubt the girl ever knew yet she is able to write about it. Also all the driving scenes it is very obvious that green screens were used and they looked as bad as a SNL skit. A big budget movie should avoid such pitfalls. On the DVD, don't forget to check out the deleted scenes to see one of the funniest scenes with Leoni's character preparing for a party.

2224362,5,B0007OCG56,"I avoided seeing this film in theaters because it just didn't seem very interesting. Even after it has been on dvd for awhile, I hesitated renting it and the biggest reason is because it was victimized by false marketing. My guess is that the studios didn't know how to market it, and because it stars Adam Sandler, they decided to market it as a comedy, which is a huge mistake. I consider this film to be a drama with comedic elements...but if you're looking for the goofy style comedy of past Adam Sandler films, you're in for a huge disappointment.

It's a shame, really, because this film doesn't fit any neat category. It must be viewed with an open mind (and an open heart wouldn't hurt either). There are some unbelievable stretches that don't work...such as the marriage between Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Throughout the whole film, I wondered why they were even a couple. They had little in common and clashed about everything, particularly the role of parental responsibility. If I hadn't seen ""The Family Man"" where I actually loved Tea Leoni's performance in that film, I would not have been impressed with her here. She plays a very annoying, obsessive and eccentric mother/housewife, who acts without thinking. She's impulsive, intense, and downright irritating. Self-absorbed/self-obsessed to pay any attention to her daughter or husband. I simply couldn't figure her out and her eccentric behavior only made me empathize with Adam Sandler even more.

Adam Sandler does seem out of place in a film like this. As often is the case, he plays the likeable hero whom audiences love. This film is a bit of a stretch, as he plays a father, husband, and award-winning chef. The last part really strained credibility with me. Together, as a couple, Sandler and Leoni are affluent Los Angeles suburbanites who can afford a fulltime housekeeper, played wonderfully by Paz Vega. This film belongs to Paz Vega, as the POV is from her daughter and the focus sits square on her shoulders. She is an amazing find and the reason why I rate this film so high. She has an uncanny resemblance to actress Penelope Cruz and if any Hollywood moguls are reading this review, those two should play sisters in some film one day!!!

The clash of cultures begin when the housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) begins to work, as she doesn't speak English and the family doesn't speak Spanish. They get by with all manner of comedic misunderstandings, until Flor decides to learn English. What surprises me with this film is that it moves in a certain direction that makes you think where it will end up, yet turns in a surprising way that is actually profound. Ultimately, this film is about boundaries. The American family are too inconsiderate of their housekeeper as they try to ""Americanize"" her daughter in a way the mother doesn't approve, so she has to decide how best to maintain the sense of boundary and self-respect. The other surprise of this film is Cloris Leachmann, who is a wonderful actress in her own right and she gives the best advice any mother could give a daughter (she plays the alcoholic mother of Tea Leoni's character). I would have loved to see a larger role for her in this film, but she is a joy to watch in every scene she's in.

The reason why I give it a perfect score of 5 stars is because of actresses Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, and the two girls who play the daughters; along with the surprising turns this film makes; and the overall message one receives at the end of the movie. Quite profound on the clash of cultures, the nature of families, and how best to handle temptations. It is a remarkable film that should have been better advertised to find the right audience.

His motives are never really clear.  I think Tea Leoni is a great actress but her performance here is one note and manic.  The maid character Flor is so perfect and wise it feels like a stereotype.

2224367,5,B0007OCG56,"The first thing you need to know about Spanglish is that it is not a comedy; it is a drama with bits of humor spread throughout its two plus hours' running time.  Adam Sandler is not the main focus of the film, nor is he the kind of boisterous character we are so used to seeing; he is, in fact, exceedingly mellow and serious here.  Spanglish is really all about the boundaries of culture, economic standing, and social circles, centering on a Mexican mother who brings her daughter to America and spends several life-changing months working for a rich restaurant chef and his increasingly insane wife.  This film has heart, and it has it in spades.

Paz Vega (who is, I have to say, absolutely gorgeous) plays Flor Moreno, a young mother who comes to America to give her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) the best life possible.  Not knowing a word of English, she works two jobs to make ends meet - until she accepts a housekeeping job with the Clasky family.  The Claskys are not exactly normal.  The husband, John (Adam Sandler), is a wildly successful chef who always seems to be in sort of a fog, while the wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a narcissistic woman with an ever-growing number of neuroses and an almost infinite capacity to annoy.  Their daughter needs the kind of support that Deborah seems incapable of providing, while their son must have been put in the film as a favor to someone important because he serves no purpose whatsoever in the story.  Cloris Leachman shines as Deborah's wise mother who has plenty of advice to give based on her own mistakes.

Things are going OK until the family rents a summer cottage on the beach, and Flor and Cristina move in.  Suddenly, Cristina is given access to a world she has never known, and Deborah is particularly brazen about giving things to Cristina that Flor could never afford - even a scholarship to a swanky private school.  John makes his own mistakes with Cristina and her mother, but he and Flor eventually develop what he might call a simpatico relationship.  Deborah eventually becomes quite out of control, basically treating Cristina as her own daughter.  Even as she is being isolated and alienated by Deborah, Flor begins drawing closer to John.  Through it all, though, she makes all of her decisions based on her daughter's best interests.

I thought Spanglish was just an outstanding film.  It may have gone a little far in terms of turning the audience completely against Deborah (Tea Leoni, I might add, seems to age about thirty years over the course of this film), but the central message of the film comes through loud and clear.  You don't exactly close the book on these characters when the movie ends, as there is some ambiguity involved with the conclusion, but that seems quite fitting here.  I thought Adam Sandler was terrific, but his casting for the role of John Clasky is a bit of a two-edged sword.  Some Sandler fans will come to Spanglish expecting another extreme comedy and be surprised if not disappointed, while other viewers may turn away from the film because they assume it is another typical Sandler vehicle.  I hope this movie continues to get the attention it deserves from all audiences, though, as it really is a wonderfully made film that tells an emotionally poignant story.",1121126400,,3287,4.731578947368421
2224368,5,B0007OCG56,"This is a journey to hope, in search of  a better future and new dreams. These two women will gather a very original family: he is a successful chef, his wife is an unpredictable, hyper kinetic and selfish woman. She has reached a social status, but nothing is enough for her. Her mother Cloris Lechman (who stole the show) is simply an assertive woman, who was in her golden years a jazz singer, she is somehow the embodiment of the maturity in the house and that's why she controls the natural order. She is suspicious, clever and very funny, trying to keep the fragile equilibrium in that home.

The frontier is far beyond from being a simple set of dots and lines. The idiom's barrier works out as a very original device to arouse laughs, but also make us think about the far from envy situation.

Sympathy's Paz Vega is overwhelming her fresh image and spontaneity makes so credible her role that allowed us to engage and make a sincere rapport with her and her circumstance.

This very original script enriches itself due the bonhomie of this lovely child who will establish the natural link between all the members of the family and her mother, who lives according nonnegotiable rules; her honesty is bulletproof, so well her affections and wishes.

I liked the smart final, there are not easy concessions, it proposes you a deep revision about your way of living, the value of those little details that establish the difference and allows to dictate the red alarm to save a boring marriage.

Every single character is a stereotype - no one ever deviates from their stock-role: hysterical rich white woman; long-suffering husband; alcoholic grandmother with a sharp wit; children who are smarter than their parents and shockingly un-damaged by it all; and the coup-de-grace: the Mexican housekeeper who is noble, wise, and quintessentially feminine.

Want to watch a good romantic comedy with Adam as our star? Try Big Daddy or the Wedding Singer. Even Fifty first dates was better than Spanglish. Adam and Drew Barrymore definatly had more chemistry going than him and Paz Vega (Flor). As for Adam Sandler being a chef, or  his family delightfully eccentric. All I can say is ""I so desperatly wish it where so."" Maybe the movie might have had more of an appeal. Otherwise, it leaves you with a huge sense of doubt.

2224371,1,B0007OCG56,"Brain circuits, reconnecting. Reality, resurfacing. Noises in head, stopping. Aaaaahhhhhhh!. Back to normal. Hopefully, the nightmares will stop.

Uh, oh. Didn't get far. Brain circuits breaking free, disconnecting from the matter, won't let me remember Tea Leoni's God awful performance in ""Spanglish"", the newest film from writer - director James L. Brooks (""Broadcast News"", ""Terms of Endearment""). Move on to another topic before brain shuts down and the drool starts.

Remember when James L. Brooks used to make really good films for adults? I know, its getting a little difficult, but make good films he did. ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News"" earned a bucket load of award nominations and awards for the various stars involved. Why? Because they were good films, with somewhat believable characters who did funny things or lived through very dramatic events. In the last decade, he has made three films. One of these was ""As Good As It Gets"" and sort of made people forget the debacle of ""I'll Do Anything"", his ""musical without music"" starring Nick Nolte. Then he made ""Spanglish"".

...matriarch of an affluent family living in Brentwood. Recently downsized, she finds she has a lot of time on her hands and naturally decides to hire a housekeeper.

Why won't the voices stop? What? Leoni's shrill voice is still rattling around in my head? What? Stop it, Tea. Leave my brain immediately. I need to finish the review in order to purge the demons...

From the moment we meet Deborah, we realize that something is wrong with this woman; she talks a mile a minute, she never shuts up for anyone, she appears to be taking some sort of medication, perhaps Speed, but no mention is ever made of this. So what is the excuse for her to act like this? Even if she were taking medication, it would take a lot of explanation to make her behavior acceptable. Her daughter, Bernie (Sarah Steele), a slightly pudgy young girl with braces, makes a sandwich which everyone loves. Deborah takes a bite and practically swoons and then says ""But you really don't need that"", referring to her daughter's slightly pudgy state. Later, having returned from a warehouse sale, Deborah presents her daughter with bags full of new clothes. Excitedly, Bernie starts to try them on and realizes they are too small, all a size 8. ""Don't worry, honey. You'll fit into them real soon."" Groan. The woman is a monster and shouldn't be allowed to raise these kids. Their son only appears in two or three scenes. Apparently, there was no dramatic material there.

John Clasky (Adam Sandler) wakes up the next morning to find Flor (Paz Vega) cleaning the house. He didn't realize that Deborah -- the voices are ringing again -- had hired someone. John owns a small restaurant (modeled after the French Laundry, Thomas Keller's restaurant) which is receiving a lot of good praise. John learns that Flor speaks no English, but she does understand quite a bit. Flor is amazed to see how Deborah treats Bernie and takes all of the clothes, letting out hems and fixing them, to make them fit. This makes Flor Bernie's new best friend. Evelyn (Cloris Leachman), Deborah's mom, a former Jazz singer who lives with the family is intent on drinking as much wine during any given day as possible and providing sage advice to her daughter as she see fit. As the summer approaches, Deborah decides to rent a summer house in Malibu...

Does not compute. Why would someone in Brentwood rent a summer home in Malibu? It doesn't make any sense. The weather is so much colder in Brentwood during the summer? If you are unfamiliar with the two, they are about ten to fifteen miles apart. Unfortunately, I am aware that people actually do this. Worse yet, as soon as they move, it becomes apparent that John will continue to commute to his restaurant. Business is booming because he just received four stars from the Times. The place is booked solid for four months. And Deborah, with her shrill, puffy face, crying all the time, screaming, or worse yet, talking a mile a minute, will continue to drive around, looking for something to occupy her time.

Deborah insists Flor move into the summer house with them. Flor's daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), has to move in as well. Deborah immediately latches onto the young girl and treats her like a life size Barbie doll, making her the new `project'. She takes her to have her hair highlighted, to see a private school, etc., all without Flor's knowledge. Naturally, the first thing any of us would do is allow someone like Deborah to repeatedly influence our child, after watching the success she has had in her relationship with her own daughter, Bernie.

Brain at critical stage. Meltdown imminent. Must purge it of all thoughts of  Leoni's performance. Must finish review. Quickly.

It amazes me that anyone, anywhere thought Tea Leoni's performance was good, acceptable and film worthy; a combination of hysterics, crying, over-the-top acting and so much more. Maybe there are real people who act like this, but that doesn't mean that we have to pay to watch them for two hours. Always crying, talking hysterically, bossing people around, etc., etc. Considering how many people work on any given film it amazes me that someone, anyone didn't say ""Ah...Mr. Brooks?"". Brooks, Leoni, Sandler, the producers, the studio executives, David Duchovny, they all apparently thought that this performance was real and believable. It is easily one of the worst performances I have ever seen on film, or television, for that matter. In one scene, Deborah learns about the four star review of her husband's restaurant. This apparently excites her and she attacks him, pushing him into their bedroom, straddling him on the bed. John (Sandler) seems to enjoy the fact that she is taking control. ""You don't even need me, do you?"" he laughs. She rides him to her finish and then immediately begins crying and her face becomes puffy and sad. Oh my God. Every time she appeared on screen, I felt like poking my eardrums out, to save the torture.

Brain levels lowering, don't really have to think about Leoni much anymore. Feeling better.

The rest of ""Spanglish"" is acceptable. Billed as a ""Comedy with a language all its own"". It isn't very funny. Once of twice, I smiled, but I never laughed. Basically, everything they do is dramatic.

It is also difficult to get past the contrived set-up for telling the story. An Admissions Officer at Princeton reads the admissions essay from Cristina, presumably 6 or 7 years later. In her essay, Cristina relates the events of her mother working for the Clasky family. How does Cristina know what the first meeting between her mother and Deborah was like? She wasn't there. How does she know how Deborah reacted to John's four star review? Clearly, she wasn't in their bedroom. It is difficult to imagine that someone would relate these stories, and others, to her. This is a sloppy, poorly executed method for telling the story.

The production values in any Brooks' film will be of the highest standards. ""Spanglish"" doesn't disappoint there. Everything is crisp, clear, pretty. There is one exception. There are a couple of scenes with characters in cars, having a conversation as someone is driving. A couple of decades ago, these scenes would be shot in a studio, using a fake car, with the scenery projected behind the actors. In the last few decades, they have advanced this process, usually shooting in a real car, on the road. In ""Spanglish"", they have regressed. It is so obvious that a significant portion of these scenes were shot in a studio making me question why? Think of the Roger Moore James Bond films. Whenever he had to jump out of a plane, the close-ups would always have his hair moving in an unnatural way. This is because he was shot in front of a blue screen and the scenery was added later. They weren't able to make his hair flow freely. Apparently, they weren't able to make Leoni's hair flow freely either.

Oh, oh. Mentioned Leoni. Brain levels back at medium, rising, rising. Must purge of all of her memories.

After Flor's daughter moves in, Deborah begins to manipulate her and Flor, because she thinks Flor's daughter is beautiful. You see, she doesn't think her own daughter is beautiful. Now she has the daughter she always wanted. Flor's daughter is accepted at Bernie's school, Deborah gives her an expensive necklace on her first day, buys her books for her, insists that she invite her friends over to their house for a sleepover. Who thought this was an interesting, believable, watchable story? Someone was very misguided. I'm looking at you, Mr. Brooks.

Every so often an actor or actress will give the performance of their career, overshadowing all others. The film becomes ""Their Film"". They earn all of the notice. Tea Leoni has done that in ""Spanglish"". It doesn't matter that Paz Vega gives a very good, believable performance as Flor, it doesn't matter that Adam Sandler does some good, if unspectacular work, it doesn't matter that Cloris Leachman is even in the film. The film is all about Leoni. And not in a good way. Her performance is so bad, she creates a black hole sucking all of the other actors in.

Hopefully, they will get out in time and move on to other projects. Hopefully, Tea will take some acting classes and learn the art of subtlety. Hopefully, I will make a million dollars tomorrow. We can all dream.

2224372,2,B0007OCG56,"I can't say that this movie was a disapointment, because I didn't expect much from it anyway.  Director/screenwriter James L. Brooks dishes up a lump of all too common Hollywood schlock that seldom ventures far from cliche and total predictability.  First the good news--the movie gets two stars because the screenplay does have its moments.  In rare moments Brooks' dialogue forces us to open an eye with his satire of the modern ""how do we feign concern for eachother's feelings when we are prepared to wage any manner of psychological warfare to get what we want"" nuclear family meltdown.  Also, Tea Leoni delivered a flawed yet memorable rendition of the neurotic underachieving, over competitive housewife, Debra, showing us a character that more complex than the critics gave her credit for.  Also impressive was Shelbie Bruce as Christina, Flor's daughter, delivering her lines in English as well as Spanish, she was always interesting to see on the screen.  Otherwise the movie, like Adam Sandler, is listliss and unimaginative.

I came to the movie as a Paz Vega fan.  After her stunning performance in ""Sex and Lucia"" it was hard to see her reduced to nods of incomprehension, mouth-open eye-darting incomprehension, and inexpressed frustration.  For approximately two thirds of the movie, her ""espagnol sola"" character is not allowed to say anything in English and the schtick wears thin.  And what a waste, to have a talent like Vega reduced to various renditions of speechless embarrassment.  But we can hardly blame Ms. Vega considering the material she had to work with.  It's a sad commentary on what an accomplished European actor will put up with in order to break into Hollywood.

In other aspects, the screenplay drags the movie down.  It's treatment of the responsibilities of parenting verges on preachy, and the pivotal moment of sexual temptation between the husband and Flor is unconvincing.  Also, the editing reduced the movie to a formless lump as important subplot naratives are left without conclusion (i.e. the scene in which neurotic mother Debra sees her pudgy dauthter in the clothes that housekeeper Fluor altered to fit the daughter).

After seeing what Spanish director/screenwriter Julio Medem did with Paz Vega, James L.Brooks handily demonstrates what Hollywood is all about--rank mediocity.  Rent it, and then forget it.",1119139200,4,2361,5.187335092348285

Paz Vega is smart, wise, Mexican, immigrant, and poor housekeeper to Sandler's two kids and cloying, controlling wife.  Flour has a daughter out of wedlock (How did that happen to such a wise woman?)and then takes the unhappy rich family under her wings as much as the language barrier will bear.  That is it.  Sandler is unhappy with narcissistic Leoni and well he should be.  He pouts and grovels.  Gradually he comes to appreciate Vega as the counterpoint to his neurotic wife.

Adam Sandler was decent in this.  It was beyond his normal range and I thought he handled it quite well.  Cloris Leachman was hilarious as Evelyn.  The little girl who played Cristina was excellent.  Tea Leoni was, quite possibly, the most annoying character in history.  The two people who stole this show were Sandler's daughter Bernie and Flor.  These two female actresses were phenomenal and created all of the emotion of this movie.

In my heart, I wanted John and Flor to end up together.  I wanted John to dump ""Mrs. Clasky"" and end up happily with someone he loved and who loved him.  But I also knew that Flor would never want to break up a marriage and that John loved his daughter too much to leave his wife.  It was a heart-wrenching ending, but I thought it stayed true to the characters.

2224379,4,B0007OCG56,"As a poor white guy who can sometimes cook and has dated women from many cultures, I can relate a bit to ""John,"" Sandler's character.  Still, as others have indicated, the man is far too saintly to be realistic.  Any other guy would have blown his top at his wife's hysterics.

Two of the biggest criticisms of ""Spanglish,"" besides Sandler's character being too nice, is that Brooks, the director, is sexist for depicting an accomplished white woman, played by Leoni, as completely hysterical and racist because of how he handles the issue of Hispanic culture and American ideals.

I've known a few ultra-rich liberal white families.  ""Deborah,"" Leoni's character is, unfortunately, not that unrealistic.  I have personally witnessed a liberal white woman mistreat a Hispanic employee.  And I've known more than one woman who could compete with Deborah's selfishness.  I have also seen the mellow rich white guy who's clueless to his wife's rude behavior towards the Hispanic help.  The only mistake Brooks made, in my experience, was in making Leoni's character too much of a caricature.

The issue of racism is a bit more complicated.  It should be obvious why Flor would want to keep her cultural identity and why should would want to pass this on to her daughter.  But would she deny her the chance of a lifetime to receive a top education?  It's a hard path to follow.  It seems like Brooks had the right intention (honoring cultural independence), he just couldn't figure out a way to show it in a way that was appropriate.

*spoiler alert*

Unlike viewers who applaud the ""family values"" ending, I can't say I enjoyed the last five minutes.  Staying married for the sake of being married is just stupid.  It's so obvious that Flor and John belong together and that Deborah should be dumped in a heartbeat.  Deborah is, quite bluntly, not just a lousy wife but also a horrible parent.  All of the kids would be better off with Flor and John together.

I applaud Brooks for his bravery in depicting (finally!) a father figure who is loving, supportive and, most importantly, non-traditional (egalitarian).  Funny how some liberal critics missed that point.

Sandler has a problem completing a sentence.  He plays a wimpish character who, as Flor said, acts like a old Mexican housewife.  And Leoni's character was too abrasive, abusive, stupid and self-preoccupied to be believed.  That she and Sandler and their two children were part of the same family just did not make any sense, either in real life or in fiction.

The family reacts in different ways, as does the maid and her daughter. I really wanted more interaction between the two daughters--exploring that aspect would have enriched the storyline quite a bit.  This movie could have gone deeper into each relationship, actually.

Tea Leoni is a rich woman who has just hired a new housekeeper who only speaks Spanish, a language Leoni cannot speak.  Her husband, Sandler, is head chef at a fine restaurant.  Both Leoni and the housekeeper have young daughters.  Tea also has a son.

Tea Leoni sees the housekeeper's daughter as the daughter she would love to have and sets out to make it true in action if not in fact.  This causes stresses all across the board.  Eventually Sandler shows up and meets the housekeeper.  Eventually love begins to blossom between the two but both know it can not be allowed to go anywhere.

In the end everyone seems to have had a fight with everyone else (not really true but it sure seems like it) and the film ends in a way most audiences will not like but will eventually convince themselves is the best that could have happened given the circumstances.  My real problem with this long long film is that it seemed very choppy.  I felt I was watching a film adaptation of a long novel and that crucial scenes had been left out.  This is apparently not the case but everyone I watched it with felt the same way.  We all agreed it was strange, choppy, erratic, and definitely NOT a comedy.

2224386,4,B0007OCG56,"James L. Brooks' SPANGLISH is a movie about the clash of cultures and lifestyles. In the middle of the movie, Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who works as a maid for the affluent Clasky family in California, sees her young daughter, Cristina, enjoying the rich lifestyle, and starts to feel disturbed by it, fearing that perhaps her daughter is starting to forget all the old cultural traditions as she is seduced by wealth. There is one scene in this section of the film that, in its own way, sums up its subtle cultural conflict: an argument that develops between Flor and John Clasky (Adam Sandler, who gives another fine dramatic performance here), in which Flor accuses Mr. Clasky of flaunting wealth and being ""smug,"" and Mr. Clasky fires back at her, calling her a ""hypocrite."" Why deny your daughter this life if she wants it?, he seems to be saying.

It is this kind of thematic questioning and ambivalence that gives SPANGLISH its real interest and unassuming power; it's why I think the movie is worth seeing, even though it isn't perfect. The character of Deborah Clasky---a caricature of neurosis and well-meaning insensitivity---is a serious (and not all that funny) flaw to Brooks' conception, since, as hard as Tea Leoni tries to humanize the character, her over-the-top neurotic well-meaning villainy threatens to reduce the central cultural conflict between affluence and tradition to a one-sided affair (I mean, which Mexican maid would really want their kid to grow up to be a Deborah Clasky? When you see the film, you'll see what I mean). And the final scene, between Flor and a gravely-disappointed Cristina, is a little disturbing in its implication that mere cultural pride trumps even getting a good education if offered it.

Still, I consider those flaws aberrations in what is essentially a searching film about whether becoming affluent does (or should) trump one's cultural roots. Because it provokes these kinds of interesting and thoughtful questions, SPANGLISH is a film worth seeing and reflecting. Recommended (with some reservations).",1117324800,2,2075,5.1

Dr. Pepper has about a 14% marketshare...How would it be if you could only find one can of Dr. Pepper in every ten stores?

So, who was the movie ""Spanglish"" made for? Mexicans? too far from true life for them...Puerto Ricans and Cubans? Can't relate to a movie about ""Coming to America poor, for a better life"" (Puerto Ricans were born Americans, Cubans were mostly either rich and/or educated escaping the overthrow of an Autocratic Government)...Spaniards?

Overall I feel the director wanted his actors to be too over the top.  Te'a Leoni was waaaaaay over acting.  This is something that someone just doesn't do, but is told to do.  Cloris Leachman also had a few moments of over acting but for the most part was good and had some of the best lines in the movie to bring about a laugh.

Shelbie Bruce who plays Christina did a great job.  She was very convincing and pulled out some fine scenes.  Paz Vega who plays Flor is breathtakingly beautiful and is able to act extremely well.

Cultures clash between two different worlds, but not without the effort to bring an understanding of where each have come and where they want to be.  In this case, hollywood meets the third world.  This is a story of  single Latin American woman who ventures to the United States with her daughter to seek the opportunity to live a better life.  The daughter narrates the story as part of an essay she writes for college entry to a prestigious university.  She owes her determination and influence to her mother.  Life finally begins in the US when her mother happens to find a job working as a housekeeper with an upscale American family where she and her daughter quickly become part of the family.  In the process, she almost loses her daughter to the family.

SPANGLISH contains an array of serious issues from alcoholism to infidelity over a laugh track of irony that each character encounter.  Adam Sandler, the chef-father, appears to take the serious guy persona as opposed to his previous comedic roles. Cloris Leachman basically steals the show as the mother-in-law who adds a little tongue and cheek one liners through out the film.  However, her daughter as played by Tea Leoni appears to be the downer of the film with her overbearing presence.

One question comes to mind, why did Brooks choose upscale California for this semi-comedic film about a Latin American woman and her daughter making it in the United States?  Yes, stereotypes prevail, but not without the attempt to bridge the communication gap.

I am reading many negative reviews here and I have to say the Mrs. and I didn't think it was that bad.  James Brooks has made some witty dramedies in the past, and Spanglish isn't going to make anyone forget ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""As Good As It Gets"", but it's not bad.

Paz Vega stars as Flor, a Mexican immigrant who is in almost every scene yet speaks hardly any English.  Flor's husband has inexplicably left Flor and their young daughter, Cristina.  Cristina is portrayed as a 12 year old by the wonderful Shelbie Bruce.  She is not only an accomplished young actress, but most of her scenes are bilingual as she acts as interpreter between Flor and the Clasky family.

Flor comes to America and is hired as a domestic for John and Deborah Clasky.  Sandler portrays John, who has opened a little restaurant after moving from New York and is declared by the New York Times the Greatest Chef in America.  Not much is made of his Cheffing - he could have as easily been Greatest Dog-Catcher, Salesman, etc.  Deborah is portrayed by Tea Leoni, and Deborah has issues.  I've read many reviews that suggest that her performance is a little ""out there"". Roger Ebert wrote ""Deborah doesn't just go over the top, she waves goodbye as she disappears into cuckoo-land.""

In my professional dealings I unfortunately encounter Deborah's kind frequently.  Deborah was a high-powered type A executive until she was downsized, and now she's all type A and no outlet.  Her family - in fact everyone in contact with her - suffers for it.

Cloris Leachman has a wonderful role as Deborah's mother, an alcoholic who was once a notable jazz singer.  She loves Deborah when pretty much no one else can, and she insightfully tells us at the end of the movie that she hasn't had a drink in weeks, and no one noticed, which must mean that she was a pretty well-functioning drunk.

The Clasky's have a little girl about the same age as Flor's Cristina, and Sarah Steele's performance as Bernice is as good as Shelbie Bruce's Cristina - just without the bilingual dialogue.  Bernice is a smart, cheerful pre-teen with a little weight problem, and Deborah does and says all the things that dent Bernice's self-esteem.

Deborah is high-strung and neurotic, Flor is beautiful and sweet-natured.  Is it possible John might be attracted to someone other than Deborah?

I expected conflict - maybe even a little adultery - but the way Brooks' screenplay works through these issues was both realistic and satisfyingly open-ended.

Reviewers who complain that the film ends with many issues unresolved must live lives that have all their issues resolved as well.

Not the best Brooks.  But not as bad as much dreck released these days.",1116201600,2,2791,4.778705636743215
2224394,1,B0007OCG56,"Oh, what a massive disappointment James L. Brooks has created.  Not being too excited about his work after seeing the devastatingly poor film As Good As It Gets, I thought that he may be able to redeem himself with some Sandler magic, while showcasing the point (like P.T. Anderson did) that Sandler has this very rich emotional side to him as well as the hysterical moments.  Sadly, this never did happen.  With an extremely choppy story, some overzealous acting by everyone involved, and one of the poorest production values this side of the Hollywood Mississippi, Spanglish proves that you can have a powerful cast, an interesting idea, and an Oscar winning director, but unless you compile them correctly, all you have is a jumbled mess of garbage.

My largest issue with this film has to be the unconnected story.  There were so many creative ideas in this film, that from the outside it looked like it could have been an Oscar contender, but as you view it from the inside, it is nothing but unfinished roads and dead ends.  Brooks knows how to tell a story, in fact, he has won an Oscar for telling his stories, but in Spanglish, he took in more than he could handle.  There were so many different elements in this film, from Leoni's secret, to Sandler's cooking, to Vega's mothering skills, to a child's dream, that Brooks could not keep up with them all and successfully bring conclusions to each of them.  Spanglish jumped from one moment to the next without giving the viewer an opportunity to say, ""Well, at least that was resolved"".  It was so choppy that I hoped that Brooks would have provided seatbelts to anyone watching.  With all these themes and elements converging into a very unclimactic ending, you leave this story with a sense of ""wha..."" You have no real grasp on this story, the characters, or the ending as the final credits begin to roll.  Who was the true protagonist to the story?  Who was the central focus?  What were the major themes that I should have been watching?  There were so many negative ""who"" and ""what"" questions at the end of this movie that I immediately threw the case to the corner of the room as if it were possessed.  Brooks crafted a pitiful story that he could not control, and the final product was this hastily made story, which began in the middle of nowhere and thankfully ended there as well.

With the story giving us nothing but questions instead of answers, it is then left up to the actors to carry the weight of the entertainment on their shoulders.  Again, with Sandler, Leoni, and Vega, you think that you would have an amazing dynamic set in place that a story could be poor without anyone noticing.  Well, let me tell you ... it was noticeable.  Sandler was not the lead that Brooks needed for this film.  While it is obvious that he can play an ""every man"" quite well, it is the emotional pressures that he has trouble with.  The scene in which he is asked to cry is ... well ... hysterically pathetic.  There is just no excitement around his character, and at one time I referred to his character in this film as ""bland"".  I think it is because Tea Leoni, who puts too much emotion into her character, poorly balances him out.  Here you have Sandler doing a low-key performance, and Leoni is well over the top.  There was no development in either of their characters, just screaming and crying.  This does not help progress the story well either.  Vega added nothing more than a ""cute"" element that honestly wasn't needed at all.  The only character that I thought did an exceptional job was Cloris Leachman who took these horrible performances and created her moment to shine.  She stole the film from everyone else, and I was proud of her.

Finally, I would like to say that if your films have won Oscars in the past, and you are living well off The Simpsons money, than you have the budget to film actors actually driving a car to their destination instead of just using a green screen and fake driving.  Maybe it was just me, but I felt as if the production value of this film was not Hollywood standards.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a low-budget film at all, but I felt that Brooks was being super-cheap in Spanglish.  This hurt this film tremendously.  Maybe it was the DVD transfer, but it felt as if Brooks was cutting numbers in the film and it began with the production value.  It started out strong, but somehow felt less and less like itself by the end.  This did not make for good cinematic viewing.

Overall, I was very unimpressed with this picture.  Brooks had a decent idea that somewhere along the creation of it went horribly wrong.  One could say that he had too many ideas and could not carry the weight of them all successfully on his camera.  There were ideas piled upon ideas that literally went nowhere, nor didn't really have any conclusion.  The elements were there, Brooks couldn't do anything with them.  Coupled with the fact that there was not any decent acting in the entire film.  This emotional step was too big for Sandler (and too fast), while Leoni was too over-the-top.  Vega felt like a stand in, while I just couldn't grasp the kiddy elements.  Finally, what hurt this film the most, I believe was the poor production value (especially in the car scenes) that brought this film into the realm of bad news bears.  While I think I am in the minority, I believe that this was not the greatest outing for Brooks, nor anyone else involved.

2224395,2,B0007OCG56,"What an utter disappointment. From James L. Brooks, the man who made ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Broadcast News"", ""As Good As It Gets"" and of course, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", comes a dramedy that has two separate agendas that the filmmaker seems intent on integrating regardless of the resulting contrivances. The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity. This part is worthy of screen treatment. The second is to show the underbelly of the liberal mindset and the seemingly rampant dysfunctional state of the family unit among the L.A. social elite. This part has been seriously misjudged.

Let me tackle the problematic second part first. In an overly sincere mode, Adam Sandler portrays John Clasky, the hottest chef in a city where culinary celebrities are at the top of the heap. His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his ""French Laundry"" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic). In fact, Keller appears in a pertinent extra on the making of the ideal late night sandwich, which includes the recipe as well. The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father. At this stage in his career, especially with his idiosyncratic tics (slurring his words, constant stooping, stumbling about), Sandler is simply not yet substantive enough an actor to pull off such a multi-dimensional role.

But the real problem is the way Brooks conceives John's wife Deborah as a character. Ta Leoni has the unfortunate task of playing the aerobicized fishwife from hell, a former go-getter who was downsized out of her career as a commercial designer. Now Deborah is a horrifying mother who chokes the self-esteem out of her daughter (as much as it is inferred her mother did to her) and shamelessly pilfers the affections of her maid's daughter. She's a therapy-driven narcissist whose competitive impulses get in the way of any good intentions, and she's always apologizing for her actions, which Brooks hopes will endear her to us. It just doesn't work because Leoni, despite her obvious talent and beauty, is not likeable enough for us to care - Deborah is among the most exhausting, disreputable characters I have seen in a movie in ages (and that includes Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling in the documentary, ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room""). The combination of Sandler and Leoni nearly torpedoes the movie completely.

This leaves us with the movie's first agenda item, the fearful assimilation of immigrant Latinos. Brooks has found a luminous actress in Paz Vega, a Penelope Cruz look-alike (imagine the Almodvar possibilities in their joint casting), as Flor, the woman who escapes Mexico with her daughter to eventually find work as the Clasky maid. Vega injects a nice quality into Flor that is at once unselfish and proud, as Flor exhibits true backbone to her employers. The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John. In fact, her innate nobility provides the framework for the story as it is essentially a flashback described by her daughter Cristina in what must have been the world's longest application essay to Princeton. In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.

Shelbie Bruce is excellent as the adolescent Cristina, especially as she cross-translates John's and Flor's argument and in a moment of unfiltered anger near the end. Sarah Steele is equally fine as the Clasky's overweight daughter Bernie, alternating between smart-mouth comments and palpable sadness. And finally in a good role again, Cloris Leachman displays her considerable skill in playing Deborah's alcoholic though self-aware mother, Evelyn, who tosses the best line to her daughter: ""Your low self-esteem is simple common sense, dear."" I only wish her character was fleshed out more to provide a better counterbalance to her awful daughter. Brooks should be commended for his high-mindedness here but docked for his hubris in having us accept these characters. The DVD has lots of extras, including enthusiastic audio commentary from Brooks with his editors Richard Marks and Tia Nolan and the addition of twelve deleted scenes again with the same trio providing comments. There is the brief Keller clip I mentioned, as well as an HBO First Look featurette that actually got me more excited about the movie than watching the movie itself.",1115769600,,5059,5.158343483556639

Further surprising is the fact that ""Spanglish"" is directed by none other than James L. Brooks who's had some real gems in the past, such as ""Broadcast News.""

""Spanglish"" however is a true unmitigated disaster.  In fact, it is so bad as to be utterly UNWATCHABLE...I lasted all of 20 minutes, much of it spent sprawled out on the floor in various yoga postures because I wanted to distract myself from the horror that was taking place on the screen and hoping for some sort of miracle to salvage this thing.

The best way to describe this movie?  Like DRINKING a pint of maple syrup!  Ugh...it is so in-your-face, bending-over-backwards cutesy and sweet and sugary and saccharine as to induce rapid fire vomiting if seen after a heavy meal.

Almost every single character in this film is a one-dimensional by-the-numbers caricature, cliche, or stereotype: Tea Leoni, as the anal retentive hysterical suburbian wife, Paz Vega as the lovely Noble Savage and Hard-Working Immigrant come to soothe and liberate all these suburbian wretches,  Adam Sandler as the usual repressed miserable and put-upon husband (similar role he had in the infinitely better film ""Punch Drunk Love""), a couple of suitably innocent and adorable little kids...bleh!

You see the plot devices coming about 200 miles away, this film is so relentlessly cloying and melodramatic, veering between French-like hyper-drama and very American Disney-kitsch, with a good dose of Steven Spielbergian cornball UPLIFTING MESSAGES thrown in just in case you wanted even more sugar.  It relies almost exclusively on language barriers and cross-cultural and socioeconomic differences to move along the obviously focus-grouped-to-death plotline.

Worse film I've seen since Spielberg's ""The Terminal.""  Well, at least this one has two attractive female leads...for that I'll give it 1.5 stars!",1114819200,15,2173,5.230547550432276
2224400,2,B0007OCG56,"Suffice it to say, I had better than average expectations  for SPANGLISH, particularly since it was helmed by James L. Brooks. That alone swayed me to watch it, despite my bewilderment that Adam Sandler continues to get work beyond  his usual one-note comedic roles.  Boy, what a letdown.  SPANGLISH, though not without its' moments(few and far between as they are)isn't a patch on his previous BROADCAST NEWS or even the flawed but still watchable AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  Alot of what's wrong with the movie(for me anyway)can be traced back to Tea Leoni's character Deborah, who has got to be one of the most utterly unlikable, unredeemable characters I've ever seen actually make it on to a movie screen.  There's so much wrong with this role--she treats her children like second class citizens in favor of hanging out with the housekeeper's daughter, she treats her alcoholic mother like a third class citizen(sorry, but I'd be drinking even more than her if I had that harpy for a child), and seems almost indifferent to the needs of her husband.  The fact that Tea Leoni, who hasn't given a decent performance since FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, plays her like an over-the-top, cartoonish whirlwind, doesn't help matters in any regard.  In relation, Adam Sandler actually gives a halfway decent performance, and Paz Vega is a true find as the immigrant housekeeper who is struggling to assimilate to new foreign surroundings while still trying to retain her heritage.  The true saving grace of the film, though, was the underused but comedically brilliant Cloris Leachman, who brings tangy zest to the role of Leoni's mother and effortlessly owns every scene she's in.  That said, this film was ultimately a true disappointment, especially from someone with such a history of rich characters like Brooks.",1114819200,6,1800,5.010067114093959
2224401,4,B0007OCG56,"James L. Brooks' latest movie, Spanglish, seemed to fly right under the critical and commercial radar despite the presence of Adam Sandler. Perhaps it was the misleading trailers that pegged the movie as some kind of goofy Sandler comedy. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the story is told by a young Mexican girl named Christina about her mother, Flor and their misadventures in America.

Those expecting Spanglish to be a typical Sandler movie will be disappointed. Brooks prolongs his first on-screen appearance for as long as possible and when it does happen it is in a subtle, understated way with no fanfare. For the first half of the movie, Sandler plays a supporting role, allowing the other actors room to do their thing and then, in the last half, he comes to the foreground as the drama between him and Leoni's character comes to a boil. As brilliant as he was in Punch-Drunk Love, Sandler is even better in Spanglish, dropping most of his usual schtick by playing a nice, normal guy who loves his family. He hits all the right comedic beats but in a quiet, restrained way and ably handles the serious moments too.

Ultimately, Brooks' films are about tolerance and optimism in a time when our society is so cynical and jaded. His movies happen in spite of the world outside. Very few mainstream American films deal with class differences and Spanglish tackles it head on as Flor and her daughter's Mexican heritage clash with the Clasky's upscale world.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director James L. Brooks and the film's editors, Richard Marks and Tia Nolan. He speaks eloquently about Spanglish with the editors chiming in occasionally.

There are 12 additional scenes, totaling 30 minutes, with optional commentary by Brooks and his editors. We see some of the footage of Flor and Christina in Mexico and a funny scene that gives Georgie more screen-time and pays off an earlier gag where Evelyn was teaching him jazz songs. With most cut footage it is readily apparent why they were cut but most of this footage is excellent and could have been kept in if it hadn't extended an already fairly long movie.

""HBO First Look: The Making of Spanglish"" is a standard press kit featurette with soundbites from Brooks and the cast mixed with clips from the movie.

""Casting Sessions"" features footage of some of the supporting cast auditioning for the movie with optional commentary by Brooks. It becomes immediately obvious that these actors were perfect for their roles and that Brooks is a genius at casting his movies.

""How to Make the World's Greatest Sandwich featuring Thomas Keller"" features footage of the chef (and film's technical advisor) showing Adam Sandler how to make the killer looking (and apparently tasting) modified BLT that his character makes in the movie. Brooks narrates this extra which, in a nice touch, includes written ingredients and instructions so that you can make it on your own!",1114473600,4,2945,4.889779559118236
2224402,4,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish is a film that would be more enjoyable for viewers who have learned to speak a second language or have moved from one country to another, because most of the funny moments are generated from culture clash and language barriers. This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, and he's doing good taste humours here like he did in Punch Drunk Love. The cast is superb in this film, especially Paz Vega(Sex and Lucia) who managed to deliver a wonderful, funny, and dramatic performance as a overly protective single mother(Flor Moreno) working as a housekeeper for the Clasky family.

Tea Leoni is very impressive as the comic relief most of the time. She plays Deborah Clasky, a fulltime mom and she's obsessed with exercise and when she became discontended with her husband John(Sandler), she started to cheat on him. She's quite a neurotic case, and only her mother(Evelyn) can fully understand her and gives her good advice. Evelyn is a witty ex-jazz singer and an alcoholic, and she was wild and promiscuous in her younger days. John is a workaholic/renowned chef and restraurant owner. He is trying his best to be a good dad and husband. His daughter is overweight and very self-consious about it, and she befriends with Flor's daughter Cristina(played perfectly by the bilingual Shelbie Bruce) who served as a translator for her mother most of the time. The several months of working for the Clarsky, Flor's life and her relationship with her daughter had reached a volatile state. She feared changes and she resented her daughter for becoming so Americanized.

This film is funnier in the first hour, and then it headed a melodramatic direction that intended to build up a touching and meaningful ending. Some of the deleted scenes will provide some clarity on certain ""unfinished"" scenes. The special feature also included some brief interviews on the leads.

It was a romantic drama with comedic elements. This is what happens when you try to do something different in Hollywood. Where its true that Spanglish avoids a pat ending-I think this is the first time that I'm actually rooting for the hero to leave his wife. And its solely because James L. Brooks refused to give Tea any redeeming qualities. Simply put, her husband was way too good for her. Her confession of misbehaving and the subsequent tears felt like another level manipulation. She never asked or try to understand how her actions affected her husband--or how her actions affected anyone.  Yes, I understand this might very well reflect a certain level realism-but in the land of movies, characters, at some point in the storytelling, are suppose to have a character arc and change.  Take Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as it Gets (antoher James L. Brooks creation) All the characters change or grow during the course of the story.  In THIS story, everyone stays exactly the same--and in return-its an unremarkable journey.

Mrs. C refused to the end to hold up a mirror to herself or bear any blame. Just when you think she's cornered-she then turns to her mother and say-this is all your fault. Even now, I'm thinking-this man chose to live the rest of days with this lunatic. He deserved better than that.

Shelbie Bruce (daughter) was adorable-and I understand the sacrifice was his feelings for his family. But what type of family are we talking about when you have a looney, self-servant mom at the helm?

I was rooting for Flor to show up that night, snatch her daughter back, and open a good old fashion can of whoop arse.  Now that's a level of realism I can deal with.

The dialogue and the situations made all of the characters' actions and words seem at once endearing and maddening, much as a real family tends to be.  I think this movie deserves a lot of praise for creating a cohesive dynamic between the characters and for making the characters themselves thoroughly human and undeniably unique.

What I enjoyed most about this film as well as Brooks' previous movie As Good as it Gets, is that I find myself liking his characters both for their virtues and their flaws.  It makes me feel better about people in general, and that is an unusual feeling for me to get from a movie.  Brooks tackles vice in a way that enriches the warmth and intimacy of a story, and in so doing yields a kind of optimism about humanity and all its attendant drama.  I find that inspiring.

I admit this movie is not for everyone.  Some people prefer less convoluted dialogue and clearer messages and storytelling.

Yes, the chef's wife had cheated on him.  Yes, the maid is single and innocent and did not try to seduce him.  Yet, it would still be wrong to embrace the affections of a married man--and the maid (Flor) won't go there.

The other climatic scene has Flor rejecting a scholarship for her daughter to attend an exclusive college prep academy because she believes it will rob her daughter's soul and identity.  The star struck daughter is devestated and publicly scorns her mother.  Full of patience, mother lets her stew for awhile, then gently queries, ""Do you really desire to be so different from me?""  Daughter ponders, and finally hugs her mother, realizing that to have a champion parent that is so strong and devoted is a far greater advantage than the ""right school amongst the right people.""

The movie follows the lives of Flor Moreno (Vega) and her daughter Christina. The film is the retelling of the events which lead to the opening sequence of the movie, the reading of Christina's application letter to Princeton. As we learn very early on in this film, Flor is a single parent, bound and determined to provide a better way of life for her daughter. Subsequently, Flor decides to flee Mexico, with her daughter along side, to find the American Dream in Los Angeles. With help from her cousin, she is able to land a housekeeping position with an upper income family, the Clasky's. It's Flor's employment with John and Deborah Clasky (Sandler and Leoni), that the film focuses.

This film has all the elements that you want and need for this type of film to work; however, it just falls short of making you care about any of these individuals. There's your successful chef (John) who wishes to be not as successful, your cheating spouse (Deborah), your alcoholic mother (Evelyn), the ever-caring housekeeper (Flor) and her always thankful daughter (Christina); but somehow the events being presented are just a compilation of stories strung together. We know that John loves his family and makes every attempt to be there for them (even giving up interest in his restaurant in order to be home more), but his wife is still able to have an extra-marital affair. We are told that Flor loves the Clasky children; however, we are presented with only the clothes alteration story as proof. Finally, the ""I love you"" scene at the end of the film is just totally off base, and comes out of nowhere.

Ta Leoni plays Sandler's wife, a human train wreck in motion, and while she is out of touch to the max, somehow we still feel for her and hope she will figure out how to turn things around.  Cloris Leachman plays the drunken mother-in-law who provides comic relief and spouts humorous wisdom at just the right moments. Sarah Steele is the slightly over-weight daughter who suffers from her mother's dysfunction, Paz Vega is the lovely Spanish-only maid with whom Sandler falls in love, and last of all is little Shelbie Bruce, the maids bi-lingual daughter through whom the entire story is told.

Every single one of them is enjoyable to watch and plays a character who is believable and has been well written.  Kudos to them all!

If the film has a drawback it might be the ending, which leaves us hanging as to the fate of this highly dysfunctional family, but in a way the ending is also a little bit refreshing.  Let's admit it... how real are the happy-sappy endings where everyone walks into the sunset and lives happily ever after?

This is certainly one I will be adding to our movie collection.

2224414,2,B0007OCG56,"This movie would get 1 and half stars if that were possible. The downfall being the ending. There are so many unanswered questions and dangling plot lines it made me wonder if this was part one, but considering it's 2 hour plus lenght, I guess that's the movie. In a nutshell, this is the story of a chef who has a nutcase wife who cannot take care of things, so they hire a maid to do it. Sandler's character falls for her, but he is a bit timid and doesn't let his emotions show until late in the movie when it may be too late. Without giving away the ending (or lack of an ending)I will leave it at the fact you will be scratching your head as the credits roll. Why some of the silly overlong conversations between Sandler and Leoni weren't edited a bit more and more time devoted to closure is a mystery that may never be solved.

On the plus side, Sandler shows more depth than he's ever given to a role, and his ""angry young man"" schtick surfaced only mildly a couple times. But he acts like he's a little slow in parts and it really isn't a trait that a 4 star chef would realistically display. But he tries, and he is slowly becoming a decent all around actor. Paz Vega is a welcome newcomer who displays a great presence (and looks a bit like Selma Hayek which doesn't hurt her or the eyes a bit!!). And the surprise of the movie is Cloris Leechman, who provides about 80% of the much needed comic relief in this sometimes heavy handed movie.

Tea Leona on the other hand, is a bi-polar mess. Would a family well off enough to be able to afford a maid really let a person in that shape languish as long as she does? It's kind of unbelievable. She is so out of it at points you'll find yourself wondering why Sandler doesn't run screaming to his car and drive away. FAST!! But that would be too easy I suppose.

So what we have here is a lot of failure to communicate. Sandler's character can't communicate with his wife, his wife can't communicate with him, neither one can communicate with the maid (until over halfway through she speaks very little English) and Cloris only communicates near the end of the movie with her daughter (and then gives some advice that is shakey given Leoni's out of touch character!!). Don't misunderstand, there is plenty of talking going on, it's just most of the time nothing gets said or resolved and the fact that with all this communication breakdown, this movie clocks 131 minutes!!!! The movie isn't a total loss, but it needed just a tad more tweaking which could have changed it from a passable piece of entertainment to a very good one.",1113436800,2,2587,4.374220374220374
2224415,1,B0007OCG56,"In a nutshell, this is a movie that aspires to something special, but ultimately falls flat in its attempt. I hesitate giving it just 1 star, seeing as it had some potential, but overall the film was a failure for too many reasons to list here.

First of the culprits is the running length: 131 minutes is bearable, even preferred, for a large scale war movie, a sweeping historic epic, or even a grand ole western, but for a quaint little semi-comedy/drama, this bulk is too cumbersome and excruciating.

The awkward script only adds to the excessive length. It gets particularly painful during some of the clunky bedroom conversations between Sandler and his over-the-top (and annoying) wife, portrayed by Leoni. One can't help but wonder if the editing team took some time off right before the film's release, and neglected to finish the clean up job. At times I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering when the plot was going to progress, listening to the characters utter more dialogue that was completely useless and seemingly thrown in... arghhh.

As alluded to before, there's also an excess share of melodrama. I think this is due more to the lack of editing than to a slipshod job by the actors. Do we really need ANOTHER drawn-out scene with Flor over-reacting to favors towards her daughter? Or Deb reacting to her husband? Or Deb's Mom to Deb? You get the point, and it continues ad nauseum. Again... arghhh.

To top it off, you have an ending that is without resolution for half of the characters (the Clasky family), and a bizarre conclusion for the main character. Let me get this right: Flor pulls her daughter out of an elite, private school (depriving her of an excellent education) because she doesn't want her to end up becoming something culturally different from herself, yet the entire movie is a narrative by this same daughter trying to get into the elite, private Princeton a few years down the road. I guess we can only visualize Flor behind the scenes, dissuading her daughter from doing that as well, seeing as her daughter never quite lost that desire to leave the almost sequestered, provincial life of her mother to engage once again in worldly learning amongst the upper class.

In the end I regret having seen this movie, and can't really recommend it to anyone. One might be quick to say that I couldn't relate to it's ""unique"" plot. But then again, my wife didn't like it either, yet she's Hispanic and the daughter of a Mexican immigrant.",1113350400,8,2482,4.749419953596288

2224417,1,B0007OCG56,"This is a film that I was prepared to like. James L. Brooks, who brought us such great television with ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Taxi"" and the Oscar winning ""Terms of Endearment"" certainly knows how to write complicated characters and relationships, so the premise of ""Spanglish"" sounded like a winning idea. The fact that this film just doesn't work even as BAD films sometimes do, is a major disappointment. Part of the problem is there are simply too many people in this film and none feel fully characterized. But the majority of the blame falls on the two leads: Tea Leoni is an annoying, whiny, manipulative harpy and (gasp) Adam Sandler as sensitive Super-Dad John Clasky just don't work. Leoni overacts and destroys her character in the same way that Felicity Huffman  does on ""Desperate Housewives."" She evokes no sympathy or identification with her character. Sandler tries to be sweet and real but only succeeds in being sappy and synthetic.  Paz Vega, the ""Spanish"" in ""Spanglish"" is better than either Sandler or Leoni, despite the fact she doesn't speak English for most of the film. Her heartbreak and confusion as her daughter, well-played by Shelbie Bruce, becomes more ""LA"" and less hispanic, is touching and real. Bruce and Sarah Steele - outstanding as the Clasky's chubby daughter - are the best things in this film. Cloris Leachman, an 11th hour replacement for Anne Bancroft, has some good zingers as Leoni's boozy Mother. She, Bruce, and Steele elevate this film but not enough.",1113177600,2,1509,4.937007874015748

Really glad the Minute Men have the guts to do what our goverenment DOESN'T. Back to the movie: Ok, the characters were not likeable, the pacing was dull, and even Adam couldn't salvage this mess.

2224419,1,B0007OCG56,"Hard to believe this dreadful sitcom comes to us from James L. Brooks, who gave us the brilliant ""As Good As It Gets."" Brooks is in full pander mode as he regugitates all the hackneyed stereotypes about whites and Latinos: The hysterical stay at home suburban mom who is utterly clueless when it comes to her family until the noble Mexican maid comes along to inject humanity and compassion back into their lives. Yawn.

Equally overwrought is the usual boo-hoo-hoo maudlin moments that lesser writers trot out as emotional crescendos, but here they are unsentimental and stupid. And what a fabulous message: it's better for the maid's daughter to become a maid like her mom and throw away a private school scholarship in order to ""be true to her roots."" I thought people come to this country to form a better life for themselves and their families. Why would the maid NOT want her daughter to have the best education she could? Great message, James.

And Adam Sandler? Alas, his best role is still ""Punch Drunk Love."" He comes across here as a semi-retarded Emeril Lagasse who can barely relate to anyone in an adult manner. Tea Leoni spends the movie sobbing and feeling sorry for herself, making you want to reach through the television and strangle her. Her costant shrieks of ""Left!"" as she passes joggers on her hourly run are funny only the first hundred times we hear it. She is truly one of the most annoying actresses in recent memory. Cloris Leachman is amusing as the drunk mother with a heart of Jose Cuervo Gold, and the  kids are cardboard cut-outs. The youngest child in this movie, Georgie  barely exists. I think he's in two scenes. At a whopping 130 minute running time, that counts more as a cameo.

Highly UNrecommended.",1113004800,8,1741,4.713815789473684
2224420,4,B0007OCG56,"In ""The Family Man"" Ta Leoni played the wife of Nicholas Cage and was as comfortable playing the character of Kate as the character was comfortable in her life.  I kept thinking how lucky Cage's character was to be married to her and hoped for David Ducovny's sake that Leoni was not really acting.  I bring up that 2000 film as a reference point because Leoni plays the wife of Adam Sandler in the 2004 film ""Spanglish"" and she is not just at the other end of the spousal spectrum she has gone around the bend.  Her Deborah Clasky is an awful person (if I did not know this the fact my wife said as much a half-dozen times during the movie would have been a clue).  She is an awful wife to her husband, an awful mother to her daughter, and an awful employer to her hired help.  What makes her so awful is that she is not abusive, so it is not a question of calling the cops and having her carted away to the betterment of her family.  She is not a malicious person and it is because her husband obviously loves her and that her daughter so desperately needs her that we want her to stop being an awful person.  The big question is whether there is anything there inside of her to build a decent human being.

This might make ""Spanglish"" seems like a horror show, but it really is a romantic comedy.  The story is narrated by Christina (Aimee Garcia) a young girl who has written her college application to Princeton explaining why her mother is the most influential person in her life (""no contest"").  We learn how Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) took young Christina from Mexico to Los Angeles and managed to work two jobs without ever having to learn English.  But as Christina (Shelbie Bruce) becomes a teenager, Flor has to find one job that will pay as much as too so she can see that her daughter is raised right.  That is how Flor ends up in the Clasky household.  John (Sandler) is a great chef whose restaurant is on the cusp of making it big while Deborah has been downsized out of a job into being a stay home mom where she has been reading way too many books on parenting.  She thinks her daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) should be a size 8 and the stars in her eyes are blinding her to the tears in her daughter's eyes.  To add insult to injury, Deb is captivated by Christina, who seems the perfect daughter she deserves.  Without any other thoughts in her pretty head, Deborah starts doing things she should not be doing.

The Claskys have a son, Georgie (Ian Hyland), but his only real problem is that when he has nightmares his maternal grandmother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) teaches him another song she sang when she was a big jazz singer.  Otherwise grandma links to drink a lot of wine.  Meanwhile Deborah's self-absorption is going beyond being neurotic or merely having the type of mid-life crisis that sudden unemployment can provoke into a black hole that is threatening to suck in the rest of the characters.  The saving Grace is Flor, who might not understand the language but understands the emotional turmoil of the household she has entered.  However, just as she begins to but this fractured family back together Deborah insists on finding a new way of tearing it apart and making Flor and Christina part of the madness as well.  Compared to his crazy wife John is obviously going to find Flor attractive, and she is aware of the qualities he has that his wife is not so much ignoring as trying to beat out of him.

Leoni is such a force of nature gone awry in this film that you have to stop and take notice that the others are turning in fine performances as well.  Sandler has not weaned himself of all of his comic elements but like ""Fifty First Dates"" this film proves that he can play a really nice guy, albeit with moments of manic insanity (several of his best moments are in the deleted scenes).  Paz Vega is a Spanish actress who signed up for the project without knowing English, which is perfect for the role, as is the fact that she manages to be both sexy and sweet, often at the same time (which is a neat trick).  She is the central character in ""Spanglish,"" but since she is the eye of the hurricance while the Clasky marriage is imploding you can sometimes forget that fact.  Both of the young actresses hold their own with the grownups, with Bruce having a great scene where she mediates rather than just translate for her mother and John having a fight and Steele nailing the pain of a teenage daughter who is closer to her dad than she is to her mom at a time when she needs her mom the most.  Leachman actually refrains from stealing every scene she is in, but she does pick her moments and she becomes the key to her daughter's salvation, which is not a move I saw coming.",1112918400,,4714,4.38735632183908

The picture starts out good enough - lots of snappy dialogue - but then it takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers: it becomes a tedious, plodding, melodrama.  The film seems to go on forever.

One of the things that killed the picture for me is that I just didn't like the Paz Vega character.  This is disastrous as the movie expects the audience to fall in love with her.  I thought she was annoying.  I also had a lot of trouble with the ending, which is supposed to be bittersweet and uplifting, but I found it totally false and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

2224423,4,B0007OCG56,"When movie trailers come out months before the release of a film and movie billboards crowd the malls and other places trying to convince the public of what to expect (read 'how can we guarantee making the most money from the biggest crowd?'), it is difficult to get motivated to step over the hype and decide for yourself the merits and message of a little movie.

SPANGLISH used slapstick approach, beginning with focus on Adam Sandler of the superfluff/toilet mouth 'comedy' genre, to publicize this little story into a COMEDY.  That was enough to keep this viewer out of the theater.  But seeing James L. Brooks current opus at home without all the hoopla of the theater crowd resulted in a pleasant discovery: this is a well-written little drama, peppered with some comedy, that addresses a lot of issues about parenting, cross-ethnicity, living your dream vs skimming off the top, having loyalty to the inner self, the desperate need for communication in today's loud world, alcoholism, etc.  Not the stuff for slapstick, nor is it treated that way.

John Clasky (Adam Sandler in a straight role that allows him to show substance over pratt falls) is a successful chef who is able to support his family with a home in Beverly Hills and a summer home at the beach (obviously Malibu).  His wife Deborah (Tea Leoni in a wildly dysfunctional mother role which she handles well), in desperation for breathing room to pursue her lackluster life, hires a non-English speaking Latina maid Flor (Paz Vega) who has immigrated to the US with her young daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce, a amazingly bilingual young actress) to make a life for herself after her husband has left her.  Deborah's daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) is overweight and the victim of her mother's misconstrued attempts to correct her problem at the expense of acknowledging Bernice's self worth.

Though busy with his successful restaurant, John finds time to be a loving father, a husband who is as supportive of his wild wife as is possible, and who gradually finds in the new Flor a gentle, honest, compassionate/passionate human being that seems to be a soul mate.  Things progress quickly: Flor learns English via language tapes on TV, Cristina moves in with the family when the move to Malibu occurs, Deborah dotes on the bright, attractive Cristina while ignoring her own daughter, Flor tends to the emotions of Bernice, and finally a marital crisis occurs which places into focus the idiosyncrasies of all members of the extended household (including Deborah's alcoholic mother - Cloris Leachman, as brilliant as ever).

The manner in which Brooks brings this chaos to closure does not sell out the way most stories do: there are no pat answers here but altered individual perceptions are suggested and we are given the opportunity to resolve them as we wish.  Is this a comedy? No, though there are many cleverly funny lines and situations. This is a pertinent drama, unfortunately mislabeled in name and in media approach.  For this reviewer this is a tender film about family needs and personal goals.  The cast is excellent, each member taking risks that prove to be successful.  Give it a try!

I agree. But I think it's about even more besides the mother/daughter, generational/cultural values tug-of-wars.

Spanglish ""opens the serape"" on glaring American manias and cruelties that we seem to have become blinded to: the driven, masculinized American white woman who has lost the power of feminity and unintentionally but inexorably torments herself and her family; the ethical and cultural dilemmas posed by the Grand Canyon socioeconomic divide between Anglos and Latinos. Especially in California, a Latino ""underclass"" props up every corner of the affluent middle-class lifestyle. Who cleans the sprawling houses, buses tables and washes dishes in restaurants, mows the lawn and tends the garden, builds the subdivions and strip malls? I could go on and on. It's a new caste system that whites, as top dogs, seem oblivious to.

Spanglish reveals all the messy realities with a compassionate eye, humor and visual gloss. Balancing on the tightrope between pure entertainment and profound human and social insight while making us laugh is what makes this a masterpiece. The movie's flaws, like it's characters, are ultimately forgiveable because they are so universally human. I buy few DVDs, but this will be one of them.",1109289600,12,1452,5.2813852813852815

We have a housekeeper who has nothing but her daughter, character and her morality living with a very rich and somewhat well known family in Malibu or Beverly Hills, depending on the timing of the movie.  It is fast paced, sometimes funny, sometimes sad and you also experience a whole wide range of emotions.

Brooks does a good job of developing the characters and even the underlying theme has some basis in real life.  Tia Leoni plays a very frustrated housewife who co-owns her husbands 4 star restaurant.  This is a unique role for me to see Leoni in.  I have enjoyed her in Family Man and Deep Impact, but Leoni is superb in this role.  At times you just think, where does she get off with her approach to life?  If she were a real person, you would just be infuriated at her.

Cloris Leachman plays her mom, she does a good job in her later years, and it is nice to see someone of her age still acting.

This is also a different role for Sandler and he, like Leoni, show that he can truly act, that comedy is not the only thing he is capable of.  You just really like him in this movie.

The premise of the story is that Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni are high school sweethearts who got married, started a family, and the wife quit her sucessful full time job to raise the children.  Both parents have different philosophies on how to raise their children, with the wife being distant and disappointed with her overweight daughter, yet she wants to be supportive - just doing it in an insensitive manner.

On a side note, Adam Sandler and the housekeeper being to develop a relationship based in mutual respect and are drawn to each other for comfort (Tea Leoni becomes a slight agitator to this as she is spending much of her own time away from her family), but both know that they can not pursue this.

Other reviewers have described the plot: Spoiled brat wife Deborah (in a much-too-over-the-top hysterical performance by Tia Leoni) hires Latina housekeeper (the stunningly beautiful and intensely endearing Paz Vega), and tries to show her that she considers her equal to the family. There is much humor and some pathos, but the enjoyment is in the supporting actors. Vega is absolutely marvelous as the proud housekeeper who sees through her employers much more than they know; Sarah Steele, an endearingly awkward teenager, is fabulous as the daughter whose mother lets her know how fat she is. The acting falls down with Adam Sandler, the perfect husband and father who isn't believable for a single minute but who isn't obnoxious about it, and Leoni, who WAY overdoes the neurotic Deborah to the point of fingernails on the blackboard.

So why did I like this movie? It is just basically a sweet story, no harm done, nothing horrible, and very enjoyable if you aren't looking for something deeply intellectual. I like it, and would recommend it despite its flaws.",1106092800,2,1316,5.059907834101383
2224438,3,B0007OCG56,"""Spanglish"" is told through the eyes of Christine (Bruce), a Mexican girl who comes to America with her mother Flor (Vega).  Flor resists Americanization as much as she can, but when taking a job as a housekeeper for the Claskys, she realizes that that is easier said than done.  The Claskys are a well to do family headed by renowned chef John (Sandler).  He is the ""good"" parent and a all around nice guy.  His wife, Deborah (Leoni) is out of work not a very pleasant person.  Her relationships with her husband and daughter are strained.  Flor's insertion into the family mix causes changes in everyone, mostly for the better.  Soon, Flor and her daughter are moving into a summer home with the Claskys, and cultures begin to seriously clash.

""Spanglish"" does not really have a plot so much as it examines a period of the characters' lives.  Since it is told through Christine's eyes, there is not as much resolution as many may like.  Instead, the story is strong on character, developing the three primary characters fully.

Adam Sandler gives another solid dramatic performance (his first was the offbeat ""Punch Drunk Love"").  He is the nice guy, and is easy to like.  You feel for the guy as he has his ups and downs, and genuinely want him to succees.  T&eacute;a Leoni brings believability to the bitchy wife.  Self centered and oblivious to other's feelings, Deborah is a character that you do not want to like.  Cloris Leachman brings some comic relief as Deborah's mother.  Finally Paz Vega does a solid job as the woman caught between cultures, struggling to do what is right for herself and her daughter.

Despite the good performances, ""Spanglish"" felt like a bit of a misfire to me.  I wanted more than I got out of it.  Perhaps it was the unlikeability of some characters or the lack of a real plot, I do not know.  In the days since I saw the movie, I have softened my review some, but I still can only recommend this on DVD.",1105660800,3,1944,4.576811594202899
2224439,5,B0007OCG56,"The reason so many people talk down this movie is due to seeing what we take for granted.  People saw Sandler in the previews, they thought they were going in for a few chuckles and sat through it saying 'what is this'.  It was way over their heads, the movie was an absolute work of art encapsulating the deepest and most significanty fundamental ideas of giving up that which we love, or which we yearn to become for the sake of our children. This explicit message is carried through the entire film until the very end where it becomes another mother-daughter spinoff. The overall illustration is the personal sacrafice one must make when raising a child.",1105401600,6,657,4.655172413793103
2224440,3,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish is about a life-shaping incident in the life of one Hispanic girl, where her mom goes to work, and temporarily lives with the American family.  The family that they are saying with though is rather dysfunctional though, and the narrator's mother's Hispanic heritage adds just another difficulty to this already hectic family life.

Overall this movie was okay, and, for those readers, rather reminiscent of Sandra Cisnero's novels.  Overall, there is a touch of dysfunction, a touch of Hispanic American culture clash, and a touch of romance.

The only reason this was not too pleasurable was that the sub-plots took too long to interconnect.  Whether it was Adam Sandler's (American dad) family or the Hispanic family the movie was about their troubles but there was nothing being accomplished.

Like I said though, overall it was ok and Adam Sandler played a particularly strong role as the chef/father/nucleus of the hectic family unit.  Check it out for a simple yet slightly deep film, temporary amusement if nothing else.",1105228800,,1037,5.136904761904762
2224441,4,B0007OCG56,"This movie was not what I was expecting when viewing the trailers. I thought it was absolutely delightful. Adam Sandler plays ""John Clasky"", a chef/restaurant owner who can relate very well to the non-english speaking maid, played by newcomer Paz Vega. The movie deals with relationships within a family, and the choices and sacrifices parents make for their children. Adam Sandler is definitely growing out of his ""Mr. Deeds"" phase and following the footsteps of Bill Murray and Robin Williams by taking on more rounded and challenging work. Tea Leoni fits well into the character of ""Deborah Clasky"", John's erratic and self-absorbed wife. The heart of the movie is Cloris Leachman, who plays Tea Leoni's mother ""Evelyn Norwich"", a woman whose constant drinking doesn't mask her ability to see what's happening beyond the surface. ""Spanglish"" is the perfect title for a movie about trying to understand your family, while not losing your mind. This movie is a solid good film, and definitely worth seeing.",1105056000,,1007,5.146341463414634
2224442,4,B0007OCG56,"I was pleasantly surprised by ""Spanglish"" and found myself enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. I would actually rate it 3 out of 5 stars if it weren't for the top-notch performance by Paz Vega, who IMO steals the show. By playing a maid, her role unfortunately does not break away from the stereotypical Hollywood role for a Latina actress. However, she is given so much screen time in this movie that she has every chance to breathe life into it, which she does in every scene she is in. And what's even better, having her take center stage lets her avoid getting swallowed up by the starpower of Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman. Although I agree with other reviewers that this movie focuses a lot (perhaps even too much) on Deborah's neurosis, I think Flor is the one whom this movie is really about. After all, the movie is narrated from the first-person viewpoint of Flor's daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) who mainly talks about her mother's experiences with the family.

In terms of the other performances, everyone does a credible job. Adam Sandler proves that he can take on a more serious role, although there were certain scenes when I almost expected him to suddenly go slapstick on us. The only scene that I found pointless is when Tea Leoni climaxes on top of Sandler with her clothes on. This scene was majorly out of place in the movie and was rather stupid and unfunny.

All in all, ""Spanglish"" is a movie that would be fairly run-of-the-mill if it weren't for the injected Latin flavor of Paz Vega, who spices things up and makes it worth seeing. This is her first major blockbuster movie in the American market, and now that she has gotten the exposure she needs, I hope she can continue to have success with her future projects.",1104710400,3,1771,4.583596214511041
2224443,3,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish is a film that attempts to display the diversity of two different cultures.  Culture clash is often overlooked when one is travelling abroad, one prefers to assume that their own culture idealism/values/beliefs/habits are one in the same throughout the world.

A movie showing the differences is always a neat idea, and is often educational as well.  Spanglish attempts to show this, but the true, the underlyining story in this movie is an unhappy American woman who needs to learn a lesson on being content with what she's got and not to reach out for unrealistic fantasies.  Sandler plays her unhappy husband and starts to stray. The premise of the Mexican mother and daughter coming to LA for a better life and finding the culture clash challenging is not the true story in this film.

That is not to say that I didn't enjoy this film, just that I thought would be focused more than what is depicted in the trailors.  Sandler is great, I really enjoy his more serious roles.  All the acting is superb, which may be the only thing that saves this movie. It is not the story of culture clash, it's a story of troubled people in a troubled marriage.  It would of been nice if the American couple learned lessons from the Mexican import, but that didn't happen.  There is really no reason or purpose for the cultural reference in this movie.

It is nontheless entertaining enough, a bit slow, a bit humerous, worthy of seeing once.",1104710400,5,1441,4.682539682539683
2224444,5,B0007OCG56,"This film was a real treat.  My husband and I went to this movie and we were delighted with the high quality of the story itself and the wonderful performances all around.

  Paz Vega is a single parent raising her daughter while working as a maid for an American family.  This is the story of how she does it while managing to keep in her own family values though being in a different culture and a different family and not speaking the language.  It's funny and heart warming, a real gem.  It's the best movie I've seen since Big Fat Greek Wedding.",1104710400,2,550,4.333333333333333
2224445,3,B0007OCG56,"John Clasky (Adam Sandler) has a problem, well actually he has two: one is his freaked out wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is in desperate need of Prozac to control her mood swings, and her general bumping off the walls in a kind of early mid-life crisis, I lost-my-job, woe-is-me, I'm just a soccer Mom now, what-am-I gonna do panic.

John's other problem is that he very well may be in love with the new Nanny, Flor (Paz Vega) who is every thing that Deborah is not: warm, loving and caring.

John Brooks (TV's ""Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" ""As Good As it Gets"") in a rare for him, miss-fire has made a film that is just not very funny: the writing is average and most of the performances are barely present. That is except for Leoni as Deborah whose performance is so whacked out and out of control; we can only blame Brooks for the miscalculation. In previous films (""Flirting With Disaster,"" ""Hollywood Ending"") Leoni has been witty, smart even Katherine Hepburn-ish. But here the material she has to work with and Brooks direction have her saying and doing things to her family that are just plain thoughtless on the plus side and ugly on the negative. Brooks: this is not ""Ordinary People,"" this is a Comedy!!!

On the positive side, Paz Vega as Flor fills the screen with warmth and sensuality and a hell of a lot of horse sense: something truly lacking in the Clasky household. She is a real find and she brings a needed stability to the proceedings. Sandler plays his regular guy, put-upon schlump here and as usual he does a good job.

""Spanglish"" is a minor blip in the career that is James Brook's but the one thing of which it will always be remembered is the introduction of the luminous and incandescent Paz Vega to the American screen.",1104710400,20,1745,4.53015873015873
2224446,2,B0007OCG56,"The title of this review is advice that works on several levels.  In my case, I was enthusiastic about seeing Spanglish and my wife was not.  We went, bad decision.  In the case of the movie, Adam Sandler is America's greatest working chef -- hey, I didn't believe it either, but the New York Times review everyone reads hungrily in the movie says so -- and St. John to everyone (and especially Flor and his daughter Bernice, particularly well-played by Sarah Steele) but his wife with whom he never talks.  Now admittedly she is bipolar -- half the time a harping shrew and the other half some sort of New Age physical fitness addict who constantly screams ""Left, left"" to people she is passing as she jogs, as if they're going to commit some kamikaze leap into her path.  One hopes Tea Leoni has replaced the agent who steered her to this part, where among other things she is required to be made up to look like a 20 years younger version of Hillary Clinton.

And why is this movie so interminably long, over two hours to reach its two banal lessons -- 1) be true to your roots and 2) you need to work continually at your relationship.  Which leads back to ... pay attention to your spouse/partner if s/he says not to see this movie.",1104710400,9,1236,4.418502202643172
2224447,5,B0007OCG56,"This is one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in the past year!  It focuses on a single Mexican mother (Flor), who is trying to raise her daughter by working two jobs.  When she realizes that she needs to spend more time with her daughter, she talks to a friend about helping her find a job that pays at least the combined salary of her two jobs.

The friend takes her to the home of a wealthy couple to be a housekeeper/nanny.  This is a major change for her because since she came to the US, she has not ventured outside the LA Mexican barrio.  On top of that Flor speaks zero English and the family for whom she will work for speaks no Spanish.

Flor also learns fast that the wealthy mother is a control freak and her restaurant owner/master chef husband (Adam Sandler) is a wimp.  The daughter is a sweet girl but badly treated by her mother because she is overweight and not ""perfect"" in her studies.  Flor develops a bond with the daughter and when Flor is forced to bring her own daughter to live with the family, Flor bonds with Sandler because they both have very strong ties to their daughters.

This movie seemed to be a tear-jerker for most of the female patrons that I saw at the theater and was a very enjoyable, fun movie for all the males.  The actress who plays Flor's daughter looks like a comer, who will be a big star someday!",1104710400,2,1354,4.2745098039215685
2224448,4,B0007OCG56,"Here is the story of Cristina Moreno and her relationship with her mother, Flor.  The story (basically) begins when Cristina's father/Flor's husband takes off when she is a young child in Mexico.  Because of their poverty level, Flor and Cristina are forced to flee Mexico in hopes of finding a better life in Southern California.  In time, Flor takes up a job as a nanny or a housekeeper (the job wasn't very specific) for the Clasky family and is thrust upon the inner termoil that is present.

The story is fun to follow and a real emotional roller-coaster.  However, I was blown away by the acting of six of the characters.  There has got to be some Oscar nominations in this movie somewhere for at least three of them.

Flor is played by Paz Vega.  At the beginning of the movie she doesn't speak a word of English, even as she begins her job with the Clasky's.  Flor is very attractive and she has one of the best looks of shock, confusion, anger, and frustration at the events that unfold before her.  It is easy to fall in love with the character of Flor who lives for nobody except her daughter and understands the sacrifices it requires to raise a child.  If everybody raised children with the conviction that Flor had then there wouldn't be a messed up kid anywhere.

John Clasky is played by Adam Sandler.  I am often a Sandler fan, except when he is shooting for laughs by being a complete drunken idiot.  If that is what you like and are expecting in this movie, don't go, you'll be sadly disappointed.  I'm glad he is shying away from that type of role these days, and he most definately doesn't play that role here.  John Clasky is the perfect father and if I had any complaint it was that he was too perfect.  Yes, some foibles were present, but I would have liked to have seen an uglier side of John Clasky to make this movie a bit more real.  However, Sandler still delivers a stand-up job that should be loudly applauded.

Next is Shelbie Bruce, who plays Flor's daughter, Cristina.  As a child actor (I'm guessing 10 years old) she does an incredible job.  Cristina is a child who thinks she knows what is best for herself and is open to the manipulations of Deborah Clasky.  She is often at odds with her mother on doing what is right and is torn apart by the decisions that her mother makes.  There was a scene where Flor, who hasn't learned to speak English, confronts John Clasky and uses Cristina as a translater.  Shelbie Bruce does a wonderful job not only translating the words of her mother, but also her feeling.  It was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Shelbie Bruce even does a great job at the end of the movie when she finally confronts Flor because of the decisions Flor has made for her.

And on to my three favorite characters.

The first is Tea Leoni who plays Deborah Clasky.  I've always liked Tea Leoni as she usually shines in every movie she is in.  However, this is the first movie where she really lets herself go, in my opinion (granted, I haven't seen most of her movies).  There are scenes where she plays her stunningly beautiful self but then there are scenes where she goes the complete opposite direction.  She gets so bad in one scene that her mother (played by Cloris Leachman, she is next) comments that she needs a fire hose to clean herself up.  It is nice to see somebody like her allow herself to get so undone in a movie.  She can play emotion very well and she doesn't fail here as she plays every emotion I've ever felt in my life.

The second is Cloris Leachman, who plays Deborah Clasky's mother.  Every scene with her in it just shines, and most of them just made me laugh out loud.  She most definately has the best and funniest lines of the movie.  However, Cloris' performance is dead on in every scene of the movie as, she too, must go through most of the emotional spectrum.

And finally, the older Clasky child is Bernice, who is played by Sarah Steele.  Bernice is looking for some affection from her parents, especially  her mother.  You see some of the few moments of excitement in her eyes when she thinks she is being treated by her mother, and you totally identify with her during her disappointments.  Again, she also has a dead-on performance with every scene she is in and forces you to emphasize with the problems her character has.

The story has a great message, which is that there is no greater sacrifice than those for your children and often through your children.  Some of the lines and the logic seemed a bit off, but the ending leaves you satisfied that you got your money's worth in a movie.  I especially love the highlighted differences between the American and Latino cultures.  I would recommend this movie for those who really enjoy a great performance on the screen.",1104451200,2,4772,4.469907407407407

My son told my wife and I to choose this over our other choice for the evening, ""Meet the Fockers"", but mine was the swing vote and even though ""Spanglish"" had a title as frothy as 'Fockers' I sided with my son's moview savvy. The film had a good many of the elements of a light flick e.g. cute kids, a shaggy dog and a somewhat bumbling genius Dad.  But its major theme (this is a very funny comedy) is integrity.  The film had parts that only one part of the audience laughed at and there were parts in which the laughter was united.  I laughed and towards the highly conflicted ending I cried.

2224450,4,B0007OCG56,"A film by James L Brooks

When Flor's (Paz Vega) husband leaves her she is forced to emigrate from Mexico to America to find work so she can support herself and her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce).  After initially finding a lower paying job in a Mexican enclave within Las Angeles, Flor finds work as a housekeeper for Deborah (Tea Leoni).  Deborah is a wealthy, self-absorbed society woman who doesn't really think of the feelings of other people.  She is also absolutely crazy in a manic sort of a way.  Her husband, John (Adam Sandler) is the normal one.  He is a very successful chef and will soon be an even more successful chef when a top critic gives him a fantastic review.  But, he is a committed family man who deeply loves his daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) and while he must love his wife for some reason, he is very frustrated with her because her callous disregard for the feelings of Bernie even though Deborah thinks she is doing the right thing.

Into this strange, messed up family comes Flor.  She is gentle, and kind, and she doesn't speak a lick of English.  Translation and communication comes through Cristina, stuck between the excitement of a new way of life provided by Deborah (she treats Cristina better than she does her own daughter) and the steady tranquil traditions of her mother.  The conflict of ""Spanglish"" comes in the form of Deborah.  Deborah will whisk Cristina away for a day long excursion without asking permission from Flor.  Her hurtful comments towards Bernie is upsetting John almost as much as Bernie.  Deborah is paying little attention to her own husband or to her family except as they might relate towards her and her wishes.  It is no wonder that we see a budding friendship (could it be more?) between John and Flor.  John, like Flor, is gentle and kind and loving and is being hurt by his wife far more than he deserves.

There is no true narrative here in the sense that ""Spanglish"" does not directly follow a storyline.  What we have is a movie about the relationships between these characters, most of whom are very likeable.  The crazy thing is that we want John to leave his wife because we know that he would be very happy with Flor and that they would treat each other well.  We want their children to get the love and attention they deserve.  We know that Flor's presence has been nothing but a good thing to John's family and that she is a positive influence with how steady and responsible she is.  If there is a villain here it is Deborah because she is just so unlikeable, yet at heart she must be a good person for John to have married her in the first place.  We only barely see glimpses of her heart, though.

""Spanglish"" has quite a bit going for it.  The movie has a stellar cast which also includes Cloris Leachman has Deborah's alcoholic mother Evelyn.  Leachman has all the best lines in the movie and I will be surprised if she doesn't pick up an Oscar nomination for her work here.  She steals every scene she is in.  The idea of an alcoholic mother could be a very harsh character, but in ""Spanglish"" Evelyn is so good natured that one could almost believe that it was Deborah that drove her mother towards the bottle.  Another highlight in this movie is Cristina's translations of conversations between her mother and John.  Not only does Cristina translate the words and the passion of Flor, but also the gestures and so we get a bit of perfect physical comedy with a younger girl saying very adult things.

The only real problem with ""Spanglish"" is that despite the strength of all of its parts, the film itself doesn't come together to make a whole that is nearly as good.  We have a film about several wonderful characters working through their problems, but it doesn't amount to very much.  I can't explain it.  ""Spanglish"" is a nice movie, a decent movie and is filled with a certain amount of heartwarming material, but perhaps because of Deborah and the conclusion, it never really delivers the promise or the pedigree of the filmmakers.

2224451,3,B0007OCG56,"In 2004, Adam Sandler starred in two romantic comedies with a dark/bittersweet edge, playing opposite two leading ladies (Drew Barrymore in ""50 First Dates,"" Paz Vega in ""Spanglish"") with whom he had real chemistry; but both movies managed to fall short of the mark. The problem with ""50 First Dates"" was it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be ""Groundhog Day"" or more typical Sandler fare. The problem with ""Spanglish,"" on the other hand, is that it's like two movies in one--and one of them isn't very good.

The movie that doesn't work is the one about John Clasky (Sandler) and his harridan of a wife Deb (Ta Leoni). As has been pointed out elsewhere, Leoni does a superb job of portraying one of the most unsympathetic characters ever committed to film, but this part of the story goes nowhere. In fact, at the end of the movie, we're left wondering just what the whole point of the relationship was.

Maybe it was simply a plot device to get the second movie off the

ground? The one that leads me to recommend ""Spanglish"" despite its flaws: the relationship between John and Flor (Paz Vega). In it, Sandler demonstrates that he can certainly play it straight, although, as in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" he can't help letting his inner SNL player loose occasionally. He's getting better, and one of these days he'll make it, but as of yet he's no Jim Carrey in ""Eternal Sunshine."" But bravo, anyway. As for Vega, in the first few scenes of the movie one fears for her, as much of the action appears overstaged and focuses too much on the language issue--but once those hurdles have been passed, she absolutely shines, in both languages.

In ""Spanglish,"" both Sandler and Vega do what romantic leads must do--make the audience want the two of them to get together and feel fulfilled if they do and somewhat empty if they don't. It wins on that count. But Deb is a distaction and her mother is pleasant but non-essential. The Claskys' son is a cipher, and their daughter and Flor's, though played by fine actresses, seem to belong in yet a third movie. As with ""50 First Dates,"" had the filmmakers been able to settle on one major theme, this could have been great--as it is, it remains worth seeing, but is more a hopeful sign of better things to come than an enduring classic.",1104192000,3,2278,4.631188118811881
2224452,1,B0007OCG56,"Hell hath no fury like a filmmaker scorned, apparently. At least that's what seems to be going on with James L. Brooks -- his latest film ""Spanglish"" feels like a tirade against a despised ex (which, rumor has it, it is). Paz Vega injects a bit of likability into the plot, but this comedy just seems like a bitter ride into marital dysfunction.

Flor (Paz Vega) and her daughter emigrate to the United States, hoping for a better life. They find employment for Jamie Oliver-like John Clasky (Adam Sandler) and his neurotic wife Deborah (Tea Leoni), who have a very weird marriage -- he is a loving husband and father, with too much pressure; she is a screeching harridan who bugs her pudgy daughter to lose weight.

Flor doesn't speak English, and the Claskys don't speak Spanish; her bilingual child has to translate for them. But a friendship starts to bloom between Flor and John, as Deborah starts to woo Flor's pretty young daughter away from her, and alienates her own daughter.

A comedy that bangs you over the head with a message is bad enough. A comedy that just bangs you over the head is even worse. This is another one of the mature Adam Sandler movies -- you know, the ones where he is called on to play a non-dolt. Unfortunately, this movie isn't worthy of such an attempt.

While the movie technically revolves around Flor and John's lives, the obnoxious self-absorbed Deborah dominates the plot. If you can get past Brooks' ridiculous bitterness, there actually a smothered message in the story about Flor. Unfortunately, it seems to be that if a person immigrates to the US, they shouldn't consider it ""their"" country, or let their kids do so. The writing has a few good lines (especially from Deborah's alcoholic mother), but stays tepid most of the time.

Tea Leoni isn't a terribly good actress, but she's given a positively loathsome character in Deborah -- she's obsessed with her body, ignorant of others' feelings, and obnoxious even in the bedroom. (Yes, Brooks takes us THERE) Sandler's so-so performance is overshadowed by Leoni's harpy performance, especially since you can't see why he's such a devoted husband. Only Paz Vega gives a performance of real nuance and ability.

The bile that spews all over ""Spanglish"" keeps it from being a moderately charming love/family comedy. Save your issues for your therapist, John. They don't make for good movies.",1103673600,2,2384,4.8452088452088455
2224453,4,B0007OCG56,"There is a disclaimer that should be attached to this movie.  If you come into this movie expecting to see a Adam Sandler movie that resembles Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or even Big Daddy, then you will be incredibly disappointed.  Yes James L. Brooks is one of the writers for The Simpsons, and the writer of Taxi, but this is anything but a slapstick comedy.

This movie is described perfectly by its title.  Spanglish can mean the lack of communication between cultures, but for this movie it represents the lack of understanding of people's feelings and the lack of communication amongst husband and wife, or a whole family in general.  And yes, there is a lot of spanish spoken to people who don not understand the language.

The movie is about John Clasky (Sandler) a four-star chef who works nights, and his wife, the neurotic Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is  used to working days. Consequently, they need a little help around the house. Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman), a washed-up jazz singer who spends her time in the bottom of a wine glass, isn't much help. The Claskys run an ad for a maid and hire Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who so hated to leave her native land for the bustle of Los Angeles that she's never learned English in her six years in America.  The familes relationship is really good until Deborah wants to move into a summer rental home in Malibu.  She wants Flor to tag along, but there is one problem.  Flor has a daughter named Christina, whom she has never mentioned to the Claskys, and Flor doesn't want to leave Christina behind.  So Deborah insists that Christina can also live with the family.  Then the trouble starts.  Deborah takes Christina shopping without Flor's permission.  John gives Christina $640 for finding sea glass.  Flor, being a very proud Mexican lady, does not like the Claskys doing these things for her daughter and becomes upset.  Then new relationships are built, some are destroyed and people learn to respect others wishes.

As for the performances, this is Sandler's best to date.  Tea Lioni does a really good job at being someone that there is no possible way of liking.  Cloris Leachman steals many scenes and is always funny when she is one screen.  She must have had some good guidence from Mel Brooks for all those years.  The stand out performance is Paz Vega.  She cannot express herself too much in words, so most of her expression comes her facial expressions.  Kind of like Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands.  She resembles Penelope Cruz a lot, but is a better actress.

The movies itself is really good, one of the years best movies.  The only real problem that I had with the movie is that is seemed to be about 10 minutes long.  Other than that, there was nothing else that bothered me.  James L. Brooks has done is again.  It seems like everytime he starts to write, something good is formed.  And Spanglish may be his best to date.",1103673600,,2920,4.657534246575342
2224454,3,B0007OCG56,"The plot of SPANGLISH has been described as ""the story of a Mexican woman and her daughter who travel all the way to Los Angeles to bring sanity to a crazy Anglo family."" Right. That's like defining World War II as a minor squabble that discomfited Europe and the Far East.

The gorgeous Spanish (as in Spain) actress Paz Vega makes her American screen debut as Flor, who, with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), travel up from Mexico to SoCal for the employment opportunities. (Whether they're ""documented"" or not is, in this politically correct age, left to the imagination.) Though she speaks no English, Flor lands a job as a housekeeper with the well-to-do Clasky family, which includes the Mister, John (Adam Sandler), the Missus, Deborah (Tea Leoni), daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele), and Deborah's resident, alcoholic mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). There's also a Clasky son, but his role is so minor as to go virtually unnoticed. When necessary, Cristina, who speaks English like a native, translates for her Mom. There must be wonderful language schools for the economically challenged south of the border.

Flor, whose role eventually evolves to live-in maid as the household migrates from Beverly Hills to a rented Malibu beach house for the summer, stumbles into a tense situation. Deborah is unsatisfied with her marriage. John, owner/#1 chef of a four-star restaurant, is Mr. Nice Guy without a clue. Deborah has an awkward relationship with Bernice, who, overweight and with dental braces, doesn't meet Mom's expectations; Deborah seemingly has no relationship with her son at all, good or bad; Deborah disapproves of Evelyn's constant drinking. Deborah spends her time running to keep in shape and satisfy some inner concept of self image. Come to think of it, Deborah doesn't do much of anything. The plot's conflict emerges as Deborah begins to treat the perfect Cristina as her own daughter without Flor's permission, e.g., having their hair highlighted together, and getting Cristina enrolled in a prestigious private school. In the meantime, John is rendered incoherent by Flor's beauty and warmth, but, being a decent fellow, he doesn't do anything about it that might otherwise be expected of a male with normal hormone levels.

Superficially, SPANGLISH has appeal. Deborah remains engaging even as she verges on Total Bitch. (OK, ok. I think Tea Leoni is a Hottie.) And there are some genuinely funny moments, as when Cristina translates an overwrought outburst by Flor, complete with vigorous hand and arm waving, and when Evelyn sobers up and tells her daughter to snap out of it. My biggest problem is with Paz Vega as Flor. She's truly eye candy I can appreciate, but I think the producers of the film want the audience to react to her as did the stupefied John, i.e., assign her a separate gender altogether based on looks. When Flor and Cristina walk off into the California sunset at the film's conclusion, all the difficulties back at the Clasky house are left unresolved. Indeed, the resentment that Bernice felt for having her place in Mom's affections co-opted by Cristine was never even dealt with. So, what was all this except a beauty contest with Vega as the preordained winner?

While I'm allowing for the fact that the point of the film was perhaps to introduce Paz to American audiences, I still felt manipulated more than the norm by the scriptwriters. If you want to see a substantive role in current release by an acknowledged screen beauty, see CLOSER starring Julia Roberts. Granted, it's not a comedy, or even something for the whole family, but at least it's not fluff masquerading as a movie with a message.",1103500800,2,3664,5.011494252873563
2224455,2,B0007OCG56,"The problem with SPANGLISH is that it doesn't seem to know which characters it's really ""about."" The film can't decide whether the Klasky family is its focus or if the focus is their maid Flor, played by the beautiful Paz Vega.

Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni play a successful couple with a bad marriage.

Sandler plays his character as a charming but befuddled doormat who only occasionally asserts himself, though he never does that with his wife.

Deb Klasky, Leoni's character, is a particularly unpleasant character. She's horribly insensitive, totally neurotic and makes some awful, awful choices. And then, for some reason, the film offers her character no ending whatsoever.

I was waiting for there to be some resolution. I wanted to know what happened to the Klasky marriage. I wanted to know where the movie went from its central confrontation.

But nothing happened.

I don't know why the movie can't be about both Flor AND the Klaskys - giving all the plots a proper resolution, but director James L. Brooks apparently thinks, at different points in the film, that it's about one set of characters or the other.

So we're left with some characters that get no definition at all (the Klaskys have a son who gets almost no screen time), some plotlines that are just left dangling (when does the young girl stand up to her mother?) and some confrontations that the movie seems to build toward that just never happen (Deb and Flor should have one more conversation).

Also, the movie is told by a narrator who CAN'T know all the things the movie is telling us.

On my way out of the theater after SPANGLISH, I heard one woman tell another that they liked it and liked, most of all, that it didn't have a traditional ""Hollywood ending.""

I found it uneven, and I found its ending a cheat.",1103500800,10,1793,4.699680511182109
2224456,3,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish is a good movie when it is about John Claskey and Flor, his Mexican imigrant housekeeper, played by Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  John and Flor both have young teenage daughters and they are interesting as well.  John has a son who is on screen some but mostly goes unnoticed.  John also has a mother-in-law with a drinking problem who has a few good moments.

But unfortunately, director James Brooks has created one of the most evil, unsympathetic characters ever in John's wife, Deborah, played well by Tea Leoni.  I don't fault Leoni because she is utterly convincing as the despicable, selfish, clueless, adulterous Deborah.  She is mean to her daughter, her husband and to especially Flor, the housekeeper she hired.  Deborah doesn't have one redeeming quality which the viewer can latch on to.  There is no reason to care about her.  Even at the end of the movie when she does perhaps see the error of her ways, it doesn't change the fact that she is a horrible person and it doesn't make up for all the evil she did to her family.

The reason to watch this movie is Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  Their chemistry together is fresh and exciting and one leaves the theater knowing these two were made for each other.  I read one review about Spanglish that said the movie isn't very good, but it does have interesting characters.  It could have been a good movie if Brooks hadn't made Tea Leoni's character so utterly unsympathetic and repulsive.  Still, Sander shows he can act without being his traditional silly self and Vega is a newcomer to America who is absolutely beautiful to watch.",1103500800,3,1602,4.675
2224457,4,B0007OCG56,"This movie was a great romantic drama with some comedy and laughs, but it wasn't all it could be. It stretches for over two hours and, if you're not used to Adam Sandler being serious, it can really bore the heck out of you. But once you get used to the vibe of the film, you will enjoy it.

The movie is told by Christina in her letter to Princeton (I think) and how she tells her up-to-this-point life story. He mother Flor, who is completely Spanish becomes a maid in Los Angeles at the house of a wealthy family. The man of the house, Sandler, has just been named top chef of the year by NY Times. The mother, whose ""company was downsized to zip two years ago,"" is a stay@home mom who has some dirty secrets (as you'll find out.) The children are laden with personal problems and insecurities and when this maid and her daughter (Christina) coems to live with them, the two families blend together (SPANISH family+ENGLISH family=SPANGLISH family!). And there are no subtitles, so you have to pay attention, which is another plus to the film.",1103500800,,1045,4.471204188481676
2224458,4,B0007OCG56,"""Spanglish"" suffers from a near-death by over-poignancy.  It's earnest and tries so hard to please.  There is a lot to like and recommend here, though.

In general, I'm not anti-Adam Sandler, butI love how he's consistently overcome doubters throughout his career.  Here, however, though he plays it straight the entire way through, I couldn't help thinking that I was watching Adam Sandler self-consciously taking on the bigimportantserious role.  In some of the key scenes with Paz Vega, he seemed uncomfortable.

Speaking of Ms. Vega, she's the start of the many things that are good about Spanglish.  Like many people, I'm tired of the star-making machine trying to cram Penelope Cruz down my throat.  I like Ms. Cruz as much as the next person, but that just isn't happening, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise.  Let's hope Ms. Vega becomes everything that Team Cruz has tried to attain.  At the very least, Ms. Vega owes Ms. Cruz a thank you for chopping down the timber in front of her.  Ms. Vega had to learn both English and Mexican-inflected Spanish for her role, so its not all natural charm and eye-popping good looks up there.

Other delights include:

Cloris Leachman...still a scene-stealer 40 years (!) after the Mary Tyler Moore show made her a household name.  The Executive Producer of MTM was a young James L. Brooks, showing that it never hurts to make friends and be nice to people.

Shelbie Bruce...as Ms. Vega's daughter Cristina, she has one incredible scene in which she acts as translator between Vega and Sandler, taking on not only the words, but also the intonations, body language and passion of the original speaker.  It's the second-best scene in the movie.

Ta Leoni...as Sandler's wife.  Ms. Leoni is this country's best physical comedienne on the big screen ('Flirting With Disaster' anyone?), and she proves it again here, with a hilarious, over-the-top, not-quite-a-sex scene, replete with jogging bra and running shoes in which Sandler is only a convenient bystander.  This one should go right up there with Meg Ryan's famous ""I'll have what she's having"" scene in ""When Harry Met Sally.""",1103500800,,2120,4.954674220963173
2224459,4,B0007OCG56,"Spanglish from Director James Brooks is a good film that tries its best to tackle social issues facing immigrants, their families, and the ""Anglo American"" culture they meet when they move into the United States (or, in this case, out of Mexico into a Los Angeles barrio and then into ""Anglo American"" culture). It is well cast; the acting is wonderful. Adam Sandler proves he can listen and be the soft, sensitive man that women yearn for; Tea Lioni shines as the tyrannical American corporate wife forced into a motherhood she can't handle from downsizing. However, after all is said and done, the film comes up a bit short of my expectations. Until the last half hour, it seems to move just too slowly. The ending scene between Flor and Cristina just doesn't feel convincing; it has a certain feel to it that seems too rushed and this that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting a better way to end the picture.

The film is actually a flashback of a young girl's childhood; we learn her story as someone reads a young immigrant girl's application to Princeton. The girl (Cristina) and her mother Flor (played beautifully by Paz Vega) come into the US, live in a barrio where her mother Flor doesn't have to learn any English and then suddenly are thrust into another culture when Flor needs and gets a higher paying job working as a maid for the Clasky family.

Although John Clasky (played so well by Adam Sandler) is doing very, very well in his profession, he is not exactly proactive at home. His wife Deborah (played by Tea Lioni) runs the household--tyrant style! Deborah is not maternal and bossy to say the least. Her lack of faithfulness to John makes her even less likeable. While one major theme of this movie is the trouble caused when two people from two cultures try to get along, another theme is that Flor (now the Clasky maid) and John Clasky eventually become attracted to each other. What happens from there I will leave off for fear of spoiling the plot for you! (Sorry.)

Although the Clasky family can help--greatly help--Flor educate Cristina at a very elite private school,  a painful dilemma ensues for Flor: should she hold onto her core Mexican beliefs and identity? Should she accept the Clasky's offer to send her daughter Cristina to an elite private school and take the chance for a better education than Flor could probably afford? A thought-provoking scene with Flor and Cristina ensues.

In short, although the movie gives us a few laughs and it delivers great acting, the plot itself is just not enough to sustain it 100% of the way. There may be disagreement, too, between viewers: does Flor make the right decision about Cristina and the private school?

What's the bottom line? I would recommend this film for its entertainment value and the performances by the actors. If you're looking for another great immortal classic like Gone With The Wind, however, you won't find it here.",1103414400,2,2918,4.745562130177515
2224460,2,B0007OCG56,"This whole film is supposedly the writing of Christina, the daughter of Flor, the Mexican maid of a rich LA couple.  She is submitting her college entrance essay to Princeton, and for some reason writes only of her experience brought to her by her mother's working for this family.

Debra (unemployed designer), John (chef, and we learn later, restaurant owner), their two kids (the boy might as well have not been in the movie), and Debra's alcoholic mother (former famous jazz singer) all live together and need a housekeeper/cook/driver six days a week.  In moves Flor, who has moved from Mexico to California (in with a cousin) to give her daughter a better life.  For awhile she works two jobs, netting $450.00 a week, then gets the gig at the Klasky's making $650.00 per week. She speaks very, very little English.

Nice idea for a movie, but the reality is rather rough on the viewing public.  Tea Leoni's character has nothing likable to recommend her - she is loud, hyper, self-centered, and stringy-haired, not to mention, insensitive to her daughter's feelings.  She tries to take over Flor's daughter, and pretty much succeeds, much to Flor's frustration.  Adam Sandler is the very nice, kind, and ineffectual father and husband.  The problem is many scenes go on much too long and go absolutely nowhere.

In the end, Flor asks her daughter if she wants to become a person different from her, her mother.  Christina doesn't answer her, but tells Princeton that if they reject her, it won't matter, as she ""is her mother's daughter"".

Pretty silly, as each person is their own individual, or should be, and should be encouraged by their parents to be themselves.
