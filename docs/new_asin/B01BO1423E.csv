She could not decide which to watch first, and with all the activities of the week, we did not get to the movies.  We'll save them for next time.  We watched most of what we had, but it was because we were so busy witth the rest of the family and her cousins.  Too bad we couldn't get everyone to our house, but all in all, her joy while watching the episodes she picked out was well worth having them.",1531008000,,556,4.073394495412844
