7910738,1,B00000ILBC,"This video is hardly worth the tape it's recorded on. It consists of shots of three yo-yo'ers desperately trying to be ""cool"" while trudging through an idiotic script geared towards 8-year-olds. Here are a few of its major flaws:
1) The yo-ers do almost nothing but two-handed looping patterns. Now, I realize this takes practice, but it doesn't need a 45 minute video dedicated to it.
2) Fast-forwarding through most of the viedo, I only saw two tricks demonstrated: split-the-atom, and man-on-the-trapeze. I expect an ""advanced"" video to contain at least a dozen tricks, all of which are explained in step-by-step detail.
3) The performers were also very obviously bored with this pedestrian display of yo-yo mastery. It was painful to watch.
4) The video quality is horribly sub-par, and appears to have been filmed with a HandyCam on tape that had already been used a dozen times, and the sound track tries too hard to be ""hip"".
I have seen far better demonstration videos than this tripe. Avoid this one unless you have nothing better to do with your cash than set it on fire.",1041811200,,1081,4.817204301075269
7910739,1,B00000ILBC,"The director of the piece of cinematic [garbage] clearly is of bad stock.  Trying to capture the passion and magic of the art of yo'ing in one 46 minute volume is fruitless to the point of fruitacity, dare I say fruiticiousness.  I've shot better odes to the Yo with my super 8, but I must never show them to anyone.  The one saving grace is being available on VHS as opposed to DVD.  VHS is clearly the format of choice of future film makers and bratty snobs like myself.  DVD is simply inferior to even the simplest VCR that has been meticulously calibrated over course of several Summers alone staring at my knife collection.  I must leave now, as I am the verge of crying.",1028764800,2,676,4.368
7910740,5,B00000ILBC,I have read all the yo-yo books and they all showed the same tricks.  I was beginning to wonder if that was all you could do with a yo-yo.  This  video inspired me to try new things and improve my yo-yo skills.  I can now  play with two hands!  The video also had fun facts about yo-yos and trivia  questions which was interesting.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes  yo-yos.,967680000,,383,4.208333333333333
7910741,1,B00000ILBC,"It doesn't really teach any tricks.... it's just the guys in the video playing with their yo-yo's for 45 minutes. Boring. Defintely not a good ""how to"" video - and it's not entertaining either.",949017600,,193,4.705882352941177
7910742,2,B00000ILBC,It's about 45 min of these three people doing some cool yo-yo tricks to pretty bad music.  They don't really expalin any tricks so basically it gets boring after about 2 minutes. Don't buy this tape if you are a  beginner or intermediate and want to learn tricks.  I think that maybe  advanced yo-yo'ers might pick-up some ideas but in spite of not because of  this tape.,947894400,4,371,4.477611940298507
