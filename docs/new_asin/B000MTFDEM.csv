8171938,1,B000MTFDEM,"I thought (because of reviews) that I might like this movie but nope, this one is one to pass up.  I think kids could have done a better filming job and acting job.  Rarely do I give anything 1 star but this movie (I watched the entire movie) was really bad and had nothing that I haven't seen before and done better.  Don't waste your time on this one as it is beyond bad!",1508889600,,373,4.013513513513513
8171939,5,B000MTFDEM,Thought it was a great zombie flick.  The game show theme was an entertaining change to the usual survival plots of most zombie films.  Not a lot of good zombie films out there so I think this deserves five stars.,1508112000,,213,4.3
8171940,2,B000MTFDEM,I couldn't make it past the first 5 minutes. Sorry.,1504483200,,51,4.2
8171941,3,B000MTFDEM,"I liked the concept of a survivor type reality game with zombies.  It wasn't the best, but was entertaining enough to keep me interested to see who would be the last survivor.  It is a low budget Survivor meets Zombie Night sort of flick.",1490659200,,238,4.386363636363637
8171942,5,B000MTFDEM,I really enoyed this movie.  It was a little different kind of prisoner survival flick.  These prisoners instead of being hunted by crazed warden and guards had to reach a goal on the other side of a deserted island without being killed by other teams and something else.,1399248000,,271,4.625
8171943,2,B000MTFDEM,"What a great concept for a ""zombie"" movie! A reality show combination of Lost, Survivor and Amazing Race with ""zombies"", sadly I have seen enough of these true reality shows to realize that the writers of Doomed have not seen them, didn't have the talent to write a movie script combining them all together, or just didn't care! Doomed had the look and feel of a made for Sci-fi channel movie, which isn't always bad, it just means that with a little more time and energy, the movie could have been really great! On the plus side, it was not a ""zomidy"" and there were no Nazi zombies! The acting was pretty good, the main problem was the believability of some of the characters' actions and dialog, and I blame the writers for this! The makers had the money cause filming, production, make-up to costumes, it was all top notch, it didn't look like an early 1970s episode of Dr. Who!
For an overall, this movie doesn't make my top fav list of zombie movies, but hands down, it is a whole lot better that the crap movie Night of the Living Dead 3-D!!!",1318896000,,1049,4.412371134020619
8171944,2,B000MTFDEM,"The Running Man + ""Survivor"" + The Most Dangerous Game + Zombies = Doomed

1) ACTING: Nothing incredible here, some actors were better than others, but due to the stereotypical characters and the movie's short run time, character development wasn't really at the forefront. and sadly, since all the ""contestants"" were major league criminals, do we as the viewer want anyone to win?

2) PRODUCTION: While this is a low budget flick, the production values were pretty good. The director did try to cover his lack of a budget with specially angled shots and colored lenses for the camera. And the fight scenes were pretty good as well. Sadly, for a zombie movie, blood and gore was very minimal. For a zombie movie, I feel that blood and gore should be a staple, unless it's not your average run-of-the-mill zombie movie. (Fido, for example, which by the way, had more blood & guts that this one) The zombie make up was kinda ""iffy"" at times, and at a few spots, it looked like some of the zombies were wearing cheesy masks.

3) ZOMBIES: These would be ""Snyder Runners' that are willing to fight as well and also would lie in wait for their victims. The make up consisted of mainly ""grayface"" with some minor facial applications. All the zombies were in army camoflauge (dunno why...). Nothing new here...

4) THE CAUSE: Unless I blinked and missed it, I have NO idea why or how these zombies came to be.

5) NUDITY: None.

This one wasn't incredibly bad. It wasn't a bad idea to use zombies this way. Again, this is one of those movies where you don't really know who to root for, since everyone is bad and you stand witness as everyone cheats and backstabs each other. Maybe a little less drama between the teams and more zombie action would've helped this one. The ""Survivor"" idea was good, and as with all reality contest shows, you may be surprised by who's remaining at the end.

RATING: 1.5 out of 5",1194393600,,1903,4.563049853372434
8171945,2,B000MTFDEM,"I saw this the other night on Showtime.  In the near future, prison inmates are given the opportunity to compete in a Survivor type reality show in order to gain their freedom.  They are released onto a small island, and if they can make it to the other side, they win.  Unfortunately for them the island is populated by zombies.  Don't let the cover art on the DVD fool you, that creature looks a thousand times better than anything you'll see in this movie.

So for 90 minutes we get to watch people running through the forest, betraying each other at every opportunity, and every 10 minutes or so one gets killed by a swarm of zombies.  There's little in the way of plot other than what I just outlined.  There's little character development, though for the most part I found about half the characters sympathetic.  The ending is pretty crummy as well, featuring the most undeveloped character in the whole movie, and it basically played out like any other five minutes of the movie.

So what does this movie have going for it?  Hot babes in sweaty tank tops.  If you like watching pretty girls run through the forest in sweaty tank tops, then you'll like this movie.  If not, well, this movie doesn't have much of anything to offer.  Personally I really like watching hot babes in sweaty tank tops run through the forest, so I may pick this up on DVD, but not for this price, LOL.  Maybe for a few bucks on Ebay.",1191110400,4,1416,4.4591439688715955
