3414857,1,B0018AV7D0,This film did not work on my DVD player although other films worked fine.  So I was unable to see it.  I am very disappointed.  Don't know what happened.  Was it too old?  Who knows?  I will not order any films from Amazon.,1359849600,,223,4.069767441860465
3414858,5,B0018AV7D0,"I enjoy watching old movies that have meaning. Maureen O'Hara is a wonderful and beautiful actress. Her earlier performances was The Hunchback of Notre Dames , Jamaica Inn and the Quiet Man (with my guy...... John Wayne)......Fantastic. Rex Harrison was  a very handsome and charming  man. He is no longer with us but was a...... 'Fantastic' actor, too........ My Fair Lady with Audrey Hepburn. To hear him speak is breath taking.
The only other comment I can think of right now...........The process and promptness on receiving my movie was 'Excellent! Keep Up the Good Work...AMAZON!",1356825600,6,585,5.147368421052631
3414859,5,B0018AV7D0,"Some of the old movies are so dated that they are hard to watch - not this one.  The acting is superb, the scenery good, and the plot a classic.  It is good in every way and I recommend it to anyone who loves movies as I do.",1350864000,14,224,3.6458333333333335
3414860,4,B0018AV7D0,"While appreciating other reviewer's disappointment at bad service, the ratings are skewed against a good film.  Rex Harrison is particularly good as a man creating a future from a failed past.  Maureen O'Hara is not as memorable but her character's central role in Harrison's motives as well as ups and downs make her essential.  The best reason to see the film is a great performance by Harrison as well as some great set work.  Certainly not a Gone with the Wind, but a good period piece with an epic scope.",1344211200,4,509,4.622222222222222
3414861,1,B0018AV7D0,The Foxes of Harrow is an excellent movie and I could not wait to own it. The dvd was defective in the first shipment.  Requested replacement and the dvd had the same defect in the second shipment.  I contacted customer service via phone because I had hoped another supplier might send the dvd without defects but was told nothing could be done about it.  Very disappointing.  It is the first time Amazon.com disappointed me.,1343692800,2,425,4.702702702702703
3414862,4,B0018AV7D0,"In 1827 New Orleans, a transplanted Irishman (Rex Harrison), who was the bastard son of the daughter of a nobleman, falls in love with the strong willed, stubborn daughter (Maureen O'Hara) of an aristocratic Creole family. He is determined to marry the girl and build an empire and a dynasty for their son. But her strong will is what will prevent their marriage from ever being truly happy. Based on the best seller by Frank Yerby (it was the first novel by an African-American to sell over a million copies as well as the first novel by an African-American to be bought by Hollywood), this is an old fashioned historical drama of the Old South that plays out like a good and juicy page turner. Perhaps since it was written by a black man, the film has some startling (for its time) moments as when (prescient to Toni Morrison's BELOVED), a proud slave attempts to kill her child rather than letting it grow up to be a slave or when a white woman takes a black child to replace the son she's lost. Joseph LaShelle's crisp cinematography could have benefited being shot in Technicolor rather than B&W. The rousing score is by David Buttolph. With Victor McLaglen, Vanessa Brown, Patricia Medina, Richard Haydn, Hugo Haas, Celia Lovsky, Roy Roberts and Dorothy Adams.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a pristine B&W transfer with the original English audio and an optional Spanish dub.",1328918400,25,1378,4.694214876033058

3414873,1,B0018AV7D0,"Interesting characters, dull story, and one of the worst looking DVD transfers around. Pass.",1405641600,,92,5.642857142857143
3414874,5,B0018AV7D0,"the movie reminded me somewhat of gone with the wind , the screenplay i thought could have been more dramatic, some scenes with maureen o hara, could have been more powerful as a woman of that period. the gowns could have been better, none the less the movie was enjoyable",1404518400,,272,4.46
3414875,5,B0018AV7D0,"I loved this movie since I was a little girl. This was one of the reasons I became passionate about American History.
Sometimes not all the content is not politically correct in the 1930 or 1940's movies but close. It is still fun doing research
to find out what was and wasn't. The DVD was very good",1399334400,,300,4.280701754385965
3414876,5,B0018AV7D0,I have and will always enjoy this movie! I was destined to find and purchase this movie at some point. Thank you very much for the opportunity!,1398556800,,143,4.333333333333333
3414877,3,B0018AV7D0,The Foxes of Harrow is a good movie but it seems to be almost a plagiarism of Gone With the Wind and therefore I could not get very excited about it.,1394755200,2,149,3.838709677419355
3414878,3,B0018AV7D0,"I liked the movie because of the actors who did what they could with a wonderful Frank Yerby story which did not transfer to the screen very well.  That reason being there is only so much time and the book covered so many other characters and their stories also.  I have read all of Yerby's books and the few made into movies just did not measure up.  For that reason I gave this movie 3*s.  If you decide to read the book, be sure to watch the movie first so you will not be disappointed in the movie.  The higher price ($20) is for the collector who has been waiting a long time for this movie to come out.  They will pay it easily. Btw,  O'Hara was good in the movie as she is firey and over acts in most of her movies.",1391644800,,722,4.006993006993007
3414879,5,B0018AV7D0,"I sure appreciate the fact that you actually had this relic in your stock.  My older sister had been looking forever for this old classic, and when I checked with Amazon and found out you actually had it, it made my year!!!!  Thanks to Amazon I have moved up a few rungs on my sister's ""hero"" ladder.  Thanks again!!!!!",1390176000,,319,4.372881355932203
3414880,5,B0018AV7D0,I LOVE THE OLD BLACK AND  MOVIES AND ESPECIALLY ANTTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE 1800'S.  THIS MOVIE WAS MADE  FROM A BOOK WHICH i HAVE ALSO READ WHICH MADE IT MORE SPRCIAL.,1370822400,2,173,4.029411764705882
3414881,1,B0018AV7D0,"WHY, are all these older Classic Movies so way-over price???--Sure some of them are GOOD Movies, but come on-- $20.00 Is way to much to pay for an OLD Movie!!!--I would be interested in buying some of them but not at $20.00 a piece. I would end-up paying over a$100.00 just for a few! That does not make any sense! Lower the prices of these DVD's and then watch them SELL a lot better. Most of us would buy a lot more of them if we could.",1369958400,2,438,4.045977011494253
3414882,3,B0018AV7D0,"It's OK, but not as good as I expected.  It came across to me as a poor-man's antebellum Gone with the Wind with voodoo overtones.",1368057600,2,130,4.2
8269295,5,B0018AV7D0,Rex Harrison is ideally cast as a scoundrel in the pre-Civil War South; and Maureen O'Hara is at the peak of her beauty as a haughty Southern belle. This picture is every bit as good as I remembered it. Highly recommended.,1518307200,,222,4.439024390243903

8269299,5,B0018AV7D0,"Maureen O'Hara ofter complained that her roles were fluffy and not very serious. But not in this one. She is terrific. Englishman Rex Harrison has a hard job portraying an Irishman, but he does fairly well. This film was 'risky' ' for it's time. I saw it when I was a kid and I couldn't understand it, but now I do. It's history.",1476230400,,329,4.238095238095238
8269300,5,B0018AV7D0,"Follows the book fairly well but without the controversial relationships that would have been impossible to detail in a movie of that era.  For those of us who like the old movies, this is a good one!",1466294400,,200,4.405405405405405

8269304,5,B0018AV7D0,The movie is exactly how I remembered it.  Maureen O'Hara plays that strong feminine character she always portrays but can't help but fall for the charming and manly Rex Harrison.  Product arrived in great condition and before the expected delivery date.  Saw this before going to vacation to New Orleans and made that our vacation especially nice.,1440374400,,348,5.0701754385964914
