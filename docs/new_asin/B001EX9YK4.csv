I was born and raised in that neighborhhood (Morris Park Avenue) in The Bronx where Contis Bakery still stands today. Tge entire movie was filmed there. It was the best years of my life. Contis bakery by far is the best around anywhere. Their Boston Creme and Banana Creme pies are worth fighting for. There were time in the not so distant past that I would make excuses t visit my in-laws but in reality it was so I could grab a pie while domn there. It;'s a 70 mile trip one way !
With regards to the movie; I really liked it alot. The acting wasn't Academy Awards stuff but that's not what the movie was intented for. Good story about family & friends. What was real nostalgic for me was that there were a handful of cameo appearances (extras) from that neighborhood that I either knew or recognized from the old neighborhood. You should check out this movie even if you didn't grow up on Morris Park Avenue in The Bronx.",1408233600,,1032,4.408376963350785
