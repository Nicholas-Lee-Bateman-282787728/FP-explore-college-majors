8449788,5,B004ZHUI06,"A fantastic program of stick training. This is simple, direct, and highly effective. There are numerous drills to help you get the most out of the fewest techniques possible. If you are a fan of the less is more philosophy of combatives, this is indispensable. You might not agree with Mr. Simonet's views. However, it would be foolish to ignore him. You would be missing out on a great learning opportunity.",1440028800,,408,4.76056338028169
8449789,5,B004ZHUI06,"I have seen and wrote reviews for several of Joseph Simonet's self-defense DVDs in the past and they have all been very good instructional films.  I especially loved this one for many reasons.  Amazingly, the entire 66 minute DVD only deals with two basic stick self-defense techniques, which shows that for practical street combat you do not need hundreds of techniques to effectively defend yourself in most situations.  In fact, Simonet emphasizes ""Complicated systems with too many techniques are not practical.""

The two basic stick fighting techniques taught in this excellent DVD include the Two-hand forward thrust and the one-handed forward piston strike.  From these two basic stick techniques you can successfully counter a multiple of different attacks.  The first technique is merely pushing forward and back on the stick as if you were doing a push-up.  The second technique is what I would describe as a windmill or as he calls it, a ""piston strike.""  Both of these techniques are for close-quarter combat, where you are in a closed space area.

The entire DVD shows various highly effective drills using the basic two stick techniques.  They include solo drills, group drills, drills using an upper-cut bag, a large hanging bag, a body type bag, a medicine ball, and other equipment. The sparring drills are also excellent.  Simonet also demonstrates the use of various other objects that can be used in the stick movements.

The final section shows how to use the two-basic stick techniques in combination for self-defense against a single and multiple attackers.  A lot of so-called stick fighting systems claim to be easy to learn but are in reality very complex and confusing systems. As someone who has been trained in numerous stick and sword systems, THIS IS THE EASIEST ONE YOU WILL EVER LEARN.

In conclusion, this is a fantastic DVD for anyone interested in a simple but highly effective stick self-defense system that truly can be learned by anyone in a short period of training time.  This is a system that anyone will find valuable.
