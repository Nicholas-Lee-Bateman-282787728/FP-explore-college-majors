the DVD Single has the bonus video ""sugar Rush"" and Art Work is just awsome i love YOU HAVE TO BUY IT nad well, the price is so cheap!-",1078099200,,323,3.9846153846153847
8274424,3,B00006SFIO,"Ok I Know This Is A DVD Single And All But It Should Have Had A Different Video Not Sugar Rush.. It's Available On The A-Teens DVD Collection They Should Have Added Can't Help Falling In Love.. If Not Heartbreak Lullaby Which Is Not Available On DVD.. They Should Have Added A Live Performance Or Something... Oh Well Let's Hope For The Next One... But FloorFiller Is Excellent...
