7868008,3,6304342616,"1 star is for the FX, 1 star for the carnage factor, 1 star for the cineamatography, and that's it. the good parts of the movie stops when Will Smith flies through the grand canyon. the characters were corney but disregarding the ""american is the greatest"" message, you might wanna join the battle to save the world too. So I guess it had that enough appeal.",995414400,,358,4.4393939393939394
7868009,5,6304342616,"This film has it all. Science Fiction, Action, Adventure, Comedy and Drama are all masterfully juxtaposed to create a good old fashioned Saturday Matinee movie undated with the latest technology and mega-budget. Very impressive as it appeals to all levels intellectually and emotionally. It covers the entire gamut splendidly delivering pure entertainment.",978566400,,356,5.865384615384615
7868010,1,6304342616,"People say ""Don't take this film too seriously"" - like it's meant to be a comedy.  The only funny thing about this movie is how bad it is.  Bad characters (is it possible to have less than 1 dimension?).  Stupid plot.  Excrable dialog.  Totally unoriginal design.  Perhaps the worst movie since Emmerich's last one (the equally idiotic ""StarGate"").  He just keeps coming back for helping after helping of stale cliche.  After writing this he must have still had the other side of the cigarette paper left for ""Godzilla"".
Big explosions.  That's all.  They may as well have called it ""Things Exploding"" - at least no-one would have felt shortchanged.
Tip for future civilisations:  Build cities out of palm trees.  They seem to survive anything.",972000000,16,744,4.911290322580645

This will be the demo disk for every video story in the country and with good reason.
The DVD is a huge improvement over the tape both from a sound and a visual  perspective. In fact, the quality on the DVD seemed even better than my  recollection of the theatre experience. Perhaps they sweetened it up a bit  for the release.
The image transfer was crystaline down to the  reflections on glass surfaces and the subtle textures on the clothing  characters wore. I saw some tiny details that just didn't come across in  the theatre...much less the VHS.
The 5.1 was so good that at times I  thought there were people talking behind me. The dynamic range was  outstanding and the special effects?  Well if you want to break your  lease, this DVD and a good sub-woofer will do the trick. I thought it would  microwave my innards.
As for the ""extras""...the additional nine  minutes added to the theatrical release was a mixed bag. Some helped and  some deserved to be cut. The nine minutes is a blend of special effects  scene and character development that made the story a little less  cartoonish. The alternate ending was pretty lame and I agree with their  decision to swap it for the one used in the theatrical release.
Some have  complained the story line is flat and full of holes...maybe, but so were  Alien(s), Starship Troopers, Terminator(s) and all the rest of the movies  that worry more about entertainment than art.
Take the film for what it  is...a few hours of great entertainment in an impeccable package...and  indulge yourself. You won't be disappointed.",961891200,,1617,4.663120567375887
7868012,4,6304342616,"People who criticize ""Independence Day"" miss the point. This is not a movie about intellectual depth or character development. It is movie that gives you alot of action, fun and some good laughs. I thought  ""Independence Day"" was great because it provided exactly what it  was suppose to provide, action, fun and laughs. I also think that Judd  Hirsch's character and the interaction between him and Jeff Goldblum was  very funny.
Those people who don't like ""Independece Day""  should have known from the reviews that this movie was not going to give  them what they wanted and they have nobody but themselves to blame if they  feel they wasted their time at the theater.",953251200,6,671,4.833333333333333
