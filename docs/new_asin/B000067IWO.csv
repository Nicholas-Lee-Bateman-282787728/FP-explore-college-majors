7963362,5,B000067IWO,"This kung fu movie has it all. It`s one of the first that I saw when I became a major kung fu flick fan. It has comedy, alittle drama and lots and lots of fighting. It just may be my favorite of all time. If you like Jackie Chan`s kung fu flicks from the 1978, 1979 such as Snake in the Eagles Shadow you will love this one. It`s definitely a kung fu comedy just like that and other movies from 1976 to 1979 during the height of the kung fu comedy craze. The final fight is long and very dynamic. The main character leaves him and lives among paupers to learn kung fu. He accidently meets an old man who is a kung fu master. He asks the old master to teach him which he does in brutal and funny style. Then he goes back to town to teach a lesson to some bullies who have been harassing him for a long time. At the end he has a fight with the bad guy of the movie and boy what a fight it is and it guess one for several minutes. It`s probably the best fight seen ever in a kung fu movie.",1442534400,,986,3.838235294117647
