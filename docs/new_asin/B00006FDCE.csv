1745830,4,B00006FDCE,"Firstly, lets clear up some misinformation from other reviewers. ""The Main Event"" WAS financially successful and was in the Top 10 of 1979! The soundtrack, with 3 verions of the title song went gold and ""The Main Event/Fight"" went to #3 on Billboard and went gold as well! Barbra actually sang this live in her recent ""Timeless"" concert and it was the highlight of the evening.
It can be very unfair to review comedies so many years after their release because humor does change. ""The Main Event"" was a sheer and fun delight in its time. It holds up quite nicely now and is not intended to be any great masterpiece of a film... just light and funny. It suceeds on both counts. I found Barbra funnier here than in ""What's Up Doc?"" where Madeline Kahn stole the show. After this film, it was basically ""serious"" Barbra from there on out. (Except for her very next film ""All Night Long"", also underappreciated!)In the AFI ""Directors"" series, Barbra comments that she should probably have done more comedies. I agree. She has exceptional timing. So to all the nay-sayers I say... lighten up!",1000339200,13,1087,4.696335078534031

1745847,4,B00006FDCE,"Barbra, as she always does, picks superlative supporting cast and gives them room to move. The fight scenes are convincing for non-fight fans anyway. This is not 'Rocky'- Thank God and Barbra Streisand. O'Neal follows her lead and lets her dominate the boxing theme. She keeps boxing exactly where it belongs in this film. It's a romance- not a boxing movie. Every time boxing starts to creep out of it's corner and become the dominant theme- she punches it back into its corner. The ending is her final triumph over the boxing element of the movie.",1466899200,2,549,4.729166666666667

1745851,2,B00006FDCE,"In the annals of boxing cinema, The Main Event doesn't stack up as one of the best specimens. It's more a passable romantic comedy than it is an underdog sports picture, and I may be laying it on too thick when I say it's ""passable."" The plot works in a Beverly Hills cosmetics executive (Barbra Streisand) whose business manager absconds with her loot and flees to South America. This leaves the suddenly penniless Hillary Kramer with one remaining asset: a lousy prizefighter whose contract she purchased four years ago as a tax shelter. Staring at $350,000 in debt, Hillary means to turn a profit on Eddie ""Kid Natural"" Scanlon (Ryan O'Neal). She becomes his fight manager, never mind that she doesn't know bupkis about the sweet science and that she abhors violence.

1979's The Main Event hearkens back to them fast-talking movies from the 1930s. Streisand's character exemplifies the screwball dame. She natters on and on and ends up pulling some zany antics, and there's Ryan O'Neal's character, infuriated. See, Kid Natural had been living it easy, hadn't really fought in four years. He's in Long Beach trying to make a go with his Knockout Driving Academy what's in the shape of a colossal boxing glove. Nowadays, he'd rather not get punched in the face. Except Hillary is an indomitable force, an aggressive chatterbox, and she wears him down, despite Kid Natural's being an expert fibber who comes up with some nifty excuses.

I'll be frank. This movie was a chore to get thru. Those who champion Streisand may mad dog me, but I thought her character shrill and oblivious and incredibly annoying, a vexing windbag. Her stabs at humor were an utter fail. Her technical advice while Kid Natural was fighting in the ring consists of ""Don't let him hit you in the face."" C'mon, Barbra. C'mon, screenwriter.

Ryan O'Neal is my guy, ever since Paper Moon. He's the best thing about this movie, never mind that I found his character ridiculously old-fashioned (and maybe a bit misogynistic). But O'Neal has got the creds to play this role, seeing as how he was a real-life amateur boxer before he set out to be a thespian. He's got the goods when it comes to performing in the square circle, although you won't mistake him for Ali or Pacquiao or Mayweather. Unfortunately, whoever choreographed the boxing matches needed to make them more electric. As it were, my adrenaline stayed at low ebb.

The ongoing dissension and caustic banter between the two leads are fun up to a point, and that point is rapidly reached. My favorite line gets uttered when O'Neal takes exception to Streisand's orchestrating his next fight with the promoter without consulting with him (and with him in the room, natch). He calls her out: ""You treat me like an object. What do you think I am? A girl? No, I am a person."" Heh. Ultimately, the dialogue lets them down, the storytelling lets them down. There's a deft touch that's absent here. More interesting is the behind-the-scenes feud between O'Neal and Jon Peters, the film's producer and Barbra's boyfriend (and former hairdresser). Reportedly, O'Neal went out of his way to goad Peters into jealous fits during his romantic scenes wtih Barbra. It got so awful that Peters skipped those days in which O'Neal and Streisand were scheduled to shoot intimate scenes.

A dissatisfied 2 out of 5 stars for The Main Event, which comes off more like an undercard. If you're into forced laughter, then have at it. The funniest thing here is Patti D'Arbanville, O'Neal's girlfriend with the hacking smoker's cough. I dunno, maybe the movie would've played better if only the suits hadn't made up their minds that Streisand in situ was enough to satiate the movie audience. Maybe if they'd put the superstar to work. As it were, the comedy comes across flat and mechanical and calculated. And there's a whiff of the vanity project here - Streisand also co-produced - an impression never more prominent than during that scene in the exercise class that seemed to exist solely to demonstrate how toned and flexible Streisand was. Listen, if you must see Streisand and O'Neal act in a movie together, then you'd do best to check out the superior What's Up, Doc? wherein Streisand comes off more genuine.",1461024000,,4228,4.842323651452282

1745918,3,B00006FDCE,"Barbra probably needed quick cash...liquid assets. It's not a bad movie. It just doesn't hold up over time like her other comedies. There are only a couple scenarios that I remember being funny. Beginning the film with Barbra's nose and her familiar non-stop chatter was genius. There is too much promotion of Barbra as ""sex symbol"" thanks to a Svengali hair dresser who convinced her that she was sexy in a way that was a tad vulgar. She was sexier the way she was...clothed. There is certainly chemistry between the two stars. The production as a whole is less than mediocre. I was a Streisand fanatic when the film was released and walked out of the theater on cloud nine. When she is self-conscious, she seems vain and narcissistic. ""Yentyl"" is the jewel in her crown. Her vision. Sexed down. Superb. And she managed some schtick in it. And looked beautiful.",1416441600,,862,4.71523178807947

1746050,4,B00006FDCE,"This film was a major hit upon release in the summer of `79.  With a budget seven-million-dollars, the film took in over $40 million at the domestic box office and became one of the top-ten grossers of the year.  Unfortunately, it has since been written off by many fans and critics alike as one of Streisand's weakest film efforts.  As for myself, I believe THE MAIN EVENT manages to be likable, funny, and entertaining.  Even though we've seen the same story a thousand times before, THE MAIN EVENT is very enjoyable while it's playing.

The scenes are all set up very well, the one-liners are funny (""I said celebrate, not fornicate ""), and Streisand and O'Neal give off a strong sexual charge between them onscreen.  The film also features a very strong supporting cast, with Paul Sand, Whitman Mayo, and Patti D'Arbanville turning in terrific performances.  Unfairly mangled by most critics and many viewers (many of whom need to learn how to loosen up), the film is complete fun from start to finish.  Ignore all of the naysayers, THE MAIN EVENT stands one of my favorite romantic comedies.

About the DVD:  The picture quality is great, and the mono sound is fine as well.  It's great to have the original trailer and the 19-minute television special, titled GETTING IN SHAPE FOR THE MAIN EVENT, preserved on disc, although Streisand's brief audio commentary is slightly disappointing.",1112832000,25,1392,4.8808510638297875
1746051,2,B00006FDCE,"That's a hard one to answer. I did smile once or twice, but even Barbra's most ardent fans will struggle to like this lame effort. The trouble is that there's nothing clever about it. So anybody who likes 'What's Up, Doc?' and thinks, Great, another Streisand/O'Neal movie I will enjoy, well, think again. Ryan O'Neal tries to be cute, but it looks like it's hard for him. Barbra's character is confusing: she starts as a high-powered business woman, but later in the film slips into 'vulnerable silly woman' character half the time. What's going on?

And do we need another movie with endless scenes of boxing? No doubt they needed something to fill up the empty spaces in the plot, between the embarrassing 'that would NEVER happen' bits that spoil so much comedy.

So what's good about this movie? Well, if you like Barbra Streisand, you get to see her, albeit with probably her worst ever hairdo. If it was anybody else, I'd give this one star, and grudgingly.",1101254400,5,964,4.6982248520710055
1746052,5,B00006FDCE,It has been quite a while since i have actually seen The Main Event but i have been trying to find it in the stores on video for quite a long time.  I can remember loving the movie.  There was a lot of screeming and yelling...but isn't that what boxers do.  I thought the way they pick on each other is cute.  I thought Barbra was precious. It is one of those movies that you come out feeling good which is hard to find these days.,1066521600,11,431,3.9767441860465116
1746053,4,B00006FDCE,"I liked the movie, it's fun and funny but what really surprised and shocked me was: PG RATING? Come on! 1. They show two butts in the movie, there is a lot of adult talk, and a lot of hintings to sexuality? It is a good movie, but I mean one would think more about the point of view of watching it depending on the rating of the movie.
All in all, this is a quite good movie which I like

7967653,3,B00006FDCE,Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal are good together in this.  This is probably my favorite Streisand move.  It is a romantic comedy.  Ryan O'Neal plays a  has been boxer trying to make a comeback and she  becomes his manager.  And doesn't know anything about boxing.  This isn't Rocky.  But it's pretty good.,1505174400,,307,4.769230769230769
