His name is never revealed, and he is only known as ""Gestur"" by the characters in the film since he is a stranger to them. ""Gestur"" simply means ""guest"" but is also not an uncommon given name.",1421971200,,371,4.082191780821918
8302285,5,B001FQ0ARG,"I have not seen this movie for many years, but when i first saw it in the early 90's it was one of the best movies i've seen. I recommend the islandic version, as I had a great time just trying to learn iclandic through the movie.... Heavy knife.... I would classify the movie as a viking ""cowboy/western"" movie.  I just wish it was available streaming from somewhere.

Description:
(English) When the Raven Flies concerns the revenge a young Irishman takes on the Vikings who raided his home and killed his parents. The raiders are in disfavor with the ruling king of Norway, and have taken up residence in the unpopulated regions of Iceland. Our hero, Gest, seeks them out and destroys them by pitting them against each other. The theme is unending revenge (a good Nordic theme) and the method of the telling is heavy on action and violence and light on philosophy and moralizing. Director Hrafn Gunnlaugsson is a self-described disciple of Ford, Kurosawa, and Leone.

(Swedish) ventyr frn 1984 av Hrafn Gunnlaugsson med Jakob or Einarsson och Edda Bjrgvinsdottir.
