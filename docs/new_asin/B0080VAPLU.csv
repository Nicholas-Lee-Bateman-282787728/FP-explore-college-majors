Office Romance is the best romantic comedy ever. That's right: ever! Alisa Freindlich (without doubt the finest actress in the world) and Andrey Myagkov are amazing. My favorite movie for the last 12 years. How pleased I am to have finally gotten a version with English subtitles.

A bonus to  this set is getting to watch the talented Andrey Myagkov play two comic roles that are nonetheless quite different.",1375747200,3,452,4.921052631578948
