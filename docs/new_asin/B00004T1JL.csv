1348871,5,B00004T1JL,"If you can't afford (or simply don't want to own) any of the excellent full-season DVD boxed sets of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" issued by Image Entertainment in 2003 and 2004, but still want a smattering of Van Dyke Show episodes around the house to pop into the VCR once in a while -- then any of these Columbia House Collector's Editions of Mr. Van Dyke's 1961-1966 TV sitcom will suffice quite nicely as a stopgap measure.

This four-episode VHS volume is entitled ""Writer's Cramp"", and sports four themed programs from the series, revolving around the three ""Alan Brady Show"" writers that co-star in the Dick Van Dyke Show (""Rob Petrie"", ""Buddy Sorrell"", and ""Sally Rogers"").

This videotape includes the following Van Dyke Show entries:

1.) ""The Return Of Happy Spangler"" (Original Airdate: April 18th, 1962; From Season 1) --- Laura runs into Rob's old boss (""Happy Spangler"", played by Jay C. Flippen) at a tie store. When Rob learns from Laura that old ""Hap"" is still alive and kicking, he feels compelled to offer his former boss a job on the staff of ""The Alan Brady Show"". Things go downhill from there.

2.) ""The Square Triangle"" (Original Airdate: March 20th, 1963; From Season 2) --- This episode really has less to do with the Brady Show's ""writer's room"" than it does with the former relationships between Rob and Laura and two friends of theirs from France. Several scenes do take place in the writer's office however, with Brady guest ""Jacques Savon"" (played by Jacques Bergerac) trying desperately to pay Rob a visit. But Rob keeps avoiding Jacques. Why, you ask? Well, watch this episode and see for yourself. ;)

3.) ""Big Max Calvada"" (Original Airdate: November 20th, 1963; From Season 3) --- Dick Van Dyke Show executive Sheldon Leonard puts in a funny acting performance in this episode, as the title character (""Maxwell Calvada"", with that last name coming straight from the corporate files of the Van Dyke Show itself -- it's the official name of the show's production company). Leonard's ""Calvada"" character is a gangster-type bigshot who invades Rob Petrie's office one day in order to strong-arm Rob and company into writing a comedy act for his nephew, ""Kenny Dexter"". Rob, et al, are intimidated by Mr. Calvada's imposing presence and end up writing the requested material for Kenny. How does it turn out? Well, cue up this episode and find out.

4.) ""The Pen Is Mightier Than The Mouth"" (Original Airdate: February 19th, 1964; From Season 3) --- This is actually Part 1 of a 2-Parter, which has Sally Rogers abandoning her writing-room duties to appear numerous times on a late-night talk show, leaving Rob and Buddy short-handed at the salt mines. The end of the episode sets up ""Part 2"", with Laura begging Rob for a chance to fill in as typist at the office during Sally's temporary absence. .... I think it might have been a better idea if the Columbia House folks had placed Part 2 of this two-part program (called ""My Part-Time Wife"", which has Laura actually going to work for Rob) on this video as well, instead of ""The Square Triangle"" episode. IMO, that would have made a more ""complete"" and well-rounded ""Writer's Cramp"" themed group of shows.

All four of these Van Dyke installments are worth watching (as are all of the other episodes in the 158-show history of this great TV series). It's hard to go wrong with this cast of actors -- Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, Richard Deacon, and Carl Reiner. This group could probably go on stage and just stand there, while saying nothing at all, and I'd probably still enjoy watching them. ~wink~

The VHS tapes in the Columbia House series of Dick Van Dyke Show Collector's Edition videos exhibit pretty good video and audio quality. The sound is from the original Mono source material (in Hi-Fi here); and the black-and-white video is Full-Frame (1.33:1). Tape speed is the preferred (and best) ""SP"" Standard mode. The episodes are complete, with no scenes edited out. The original show openings and closing credits are also intact. This tape comes packaged in a plastic clamshell case with a removable wrap-around paper insert/cover.

Let's have some additional Dick Van Dyke Show fun here, OK? ..... For some reason, the following topic of ""Van Dyke Show Props"" popped into my brain recently, and I created a list of ""Most-Wanted Props"" from the show (seen below).

It'd be kind of nice to own some of the stuff that was originally used during the series, like the famous ""ottoman"" that Rob Petrie was always tripping over in the opening credits.

There are many other Van Dyke Show props (in addition to the well-known ottoman) that would make cool souvenirs.

Items such as:

>> ""The Thing"", from ""The Masterpiece"" episode.

>> Buddy Sorrell's ""Meerschatz Pipe"".

>> Empress Carlotta's Necklace (I wonder who has possession of this ""chandelier"" now?) ;)

>> The picture that is seen on the wall behind the couch in Rob's office that shows an image of a Las Vegas hotel sign that says ""Now Appearing: Danny Thomas"" on the marquee.

>> The ""8 Ball"" from Rob's office desk.

>> That famous nine-foot curved couch from the Petrie living room.

>> The hand-painted tie that maid ""Maria"" painted with one hand tied behind her back in ""Turtles, Ties And Toreadors"".

>> The huge flying saucer toy from ""Uhny Uftz"".

>> The infamous cut-off bath spout that was on Laura's toe in ""Never Bathe On Saturday"".

>> The old rolltop desk from ""The Great Petrie Fortune"".

>> The huge campaign poster proclaiming ""Rob Petrie For City Council"".

>> The potato that was shaped like a duck from ""Odd But True"". I wonder if there were actually two potatoes...one with the head bit off and one intact? Or maybe it wasn't a REAL potato after all. ;)

>> The bull-fighting outfit from ""Viva Petrie"".

>> The ugly Petrie brooch shaped like the United States (stones included).

>> The picture of ""Big Bad Brady"" from ""The Gunslinger"".

>> The cannon that Rob used to ""shoot"" at the policeman while he was visiting Benny Joey's nightclub.

>> The enormous pair of scissors used by Mel Cooley in Season One's ""Washington Vs. The Bunny"".

>> Ritchie's pith helmet from the woodpecker episode.

>> The inflatable life raft from ""The Curious Thing About Women"".

>> The cool ""Lazy Susan"" rotating snack-mix tray, used to display the proverbial ""Potato Poopies"", ""Corn Curlies"", and ""Wheat Whippies"". :)

>> The portable TV in the Petrie living room (which was wheeled into the bedroom as needed).

>> Rob's ""Tiger Pajamas"". Cool!

>> Laura's spiffy capri pants (any pair will do). (I won't wear them myself, you understand.)

>> Laura's gorgeous Jackie Kennedy-esque outfit (with Jackie-like pillbox hat) that Mary Tyler Moore wore in ""Very Old Shoes, Very Old Rice"". (Clothing Disclaimer #2: I won't put this outfit on either.)

>> The sweater that was worn by BOTH Rob and Jerry in many first-year episodes.

>> The fish aquarium that we only see once (in ""The Night The Roof Fell In"").

>> The stuffed monkey that causes Rob some problems in ""My Mother Can Beat Up My Father"".

>> The big-mouthed ""caricature"" portrait that Rob painted of Laura in ""Draw Me A Pear"".

>> Any original Dick Van Dyke Show script (or similar paper items from the show).

>> The life-sized cardboard Christmas stand-up display depicting MTM and Dick Van Dyke, used in a Kent Cigarettes commercial during Season 2.

>> Rob's little ""Geronimo"" (motorcycle) from ""Br-rooom, Br-rooom"".

>> The photograph of 'Abe Lincoln's back' (from ""The Great Petrie Fortune"").

---------------

If you have a desire to take a look at every single one of the above ""props"" that can be seen in various episodes of one of the finest and groundbreaking TV shows in television history -- you can do just that by picking up all five season sets of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" on DVD.

Or: Try and find a copy of this 4-episode VHS tape from Columbia House. Then you'll at least have four episodes of this fabulous series.

In closing .... As a ""prop"" tie-in to this specific VHS tape, let me add one more item to my list of props above that pertains to one of the episodes on this videocassette --- The sugar cube that Laura has saved for years in ""The Square Triangle"". (Think it still survives all these years later?)",1133481600,,8286,4.789177793394238

The commercials are cut into the show (and are not the originals as the DVD Show was sponsored by Kent Cigarettes, not Camels) but the true value is the show itself.  The two episodes, ""Hustling a Hustler"" and ""Bank Book 6565696,"" are some-what classics of the series. (Especially ""Bank Book,"" though it isn't as popular as an episode like ""Coast To Coast Big Mouth"" or the ever-popular ""That's My Boy?!?"")

Carl Reiner and his gang really created a great series here, hard to select the ""20 best"" out of all that they did.  The show never grows tiresome.

I loved watching it then and have watched it several times since. And it still has the same magical chemistry that made the series so popular in the early to mid-1960's.
Even though the original series began and ended before I was even born, I still love the show and the actors and actressess and the memorable characters they portrayed.
This show NEEDS to be issued on DVD/BlueRay as a companion to the original series.

1348944,5,B00004T1JL,"THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW: Based on creator CARL REINER's experiences as a writer/actor for ""golden age"" TV series YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS, TDVDS starred the more versatile rubber-limbed comic DICK VAN DYKE. ROB PETRIE, head scribe for the fictional ALAN BRADY SHOW (REINER made scene stealin' cameos as its meglomaniacal star), was ably supported by borscht-belt comics ROSE MARIE and MOREY AMSTERDAM as his wisecracking staff, and MARY TYLER MOORE as his charming hand-wringer of a wife LAURA. Unlike its sitcom predecessors, PETRIE's work life was given as much screen time as his domestic adventures in a comfy New Rochelle suburb. Going to the office seldom seemed so inviting, especially one so equipped with sofa, TV, dartboard, and other creature comforts. RICHARD DEACON's unflappable producer MEL COOLEY interrupted the highjinks often, even though viewers knew he was really just ALAN BRADY's whipping boy (not to mention BUDDY SORRELL's). Slapstick bits, comedy monologues, and vibrant song and dance routines were all woven seamlessly into the plotlines, giving the talented cast a chance to mug and shine. Sexy and chic ROB & LAURA PETRIE were TV's classiest couple, and the intelligent scripts, often supplied by REINER, placed the show several rungs above the competition. This is as sophisiticated, hip and hilarious as early 60s TV ever got. VAN DYKE himself has admitted that doing this series was the most fun he ever had...and it shows in every warm embrace and pratfall.

1348951,5,B00004T1JL,"I don't think it's a coincidence that Rob and Laura Petrie (Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore) bore a fleeting resemblance to the then-reigning couple of Camelot, President John F. Kennedy and his fashion-forward wife Jackie, when the classic sitcom debuted in 1961. The youthful appeal of the Petries broke the mold established by previous depictions of married couples simply because they looked like they were actually having sex. It also helped that the show was created by Carl Reiner, a veteran comedy writer of Sid Caesar's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Show-of-Shows/dp/630366654X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Show of Shows</a>&nbsp;alongside Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. This experience was the inspiration for the setting of Van Dyke's show, which in turn was populated by one of TV's best casts.

The premise was simple - Rob Petrie was the head comedy writer for ""The Alan Brady Show"", a popular comedy-variety series based in Manhattan. Rob worked with two other writers, Borscht Belt comic Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) and man-hungry Sally Rogers (Rose Marie), under the constant glare of producer Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon), who happens to be the reviled brother-in-law of the show's star. At home in suburban New Rochelle is Rob's pretty wife Laura, a former USO dancer, and their son Richie (Larry Mathews), along with their next-door neighbors, dentist Jerry Helper (Jerry Paris) and his wife Millie (Ann Morgan Guilbert). Unlike previous shows that focused on either the workplace or home life,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dick-Van-Dyke-Show/dp/B0007WFY4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a>&nbsp;gave equal attention to both aspects of Petrie's world and often creatively synthesized both. Reiner occasionally played Brady, who was initially just heard and shown from the back.

A total of 158 episodes were produced over five seasons, and all are available individually for download on Amazon Unbox Video Downloads. Several are memorable, but I have two particular favorites that I downloaded to great satisfaction. Written by Sheldon Keller and Howard Merrill, the first is ""All About Eavesdropping"" (Season Two, Episode 33) in which Rob and Laura overhear some catty comments Jerry and Millie make about them. The complication is that the Petries hear the remarks over Richie's toy intercom unbeknownst to the Helpers. The Petries' seething anger is played to coordinated perfection by Van Dyke and Moore, who showcase their passive-aggressiveness in a hysterical game of charades (""Malicious accusory!"").

Written by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, the second is the classic ""Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth"" (Season Five, Episode One), in which Laura blurts out on a nationally televised game show that Alan Brady is bald, a revelation that could cost Rob his job. Moore never had a better showcase for her unique talent of simultaneously crying and talking under duress. She and Reiner are hilarious in the scene where she tries to apologize to Brady in front of a line of styrofoam heads each with one of Brady's cast-off toupees. As Brady angrily asks Laura what he should do with the toupees, her response is classic - ""There must be some needy bald people?"". If you're like me, a baby boomer who has seen every episode at least a dozen times, the flexibility to download favorite episodes is a great breakthrough. This is indeed classic television, and the quality of the video downloads is first-rate on my PC.",1201219200,2,3556,5.5814814814814815

You get a feel for the series, and see why it was so memorable.  A great cast, great writing, and the natural chemistry between Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore made this series one in a million.",1182556800,,356,4.268656716417911

Many retirees have fond memories of The Dick Van Dyke Show because they watched it three or four decades ago. In addition, many of these retirees use DVD's. They don't subscribe to live streaming shows. Note: The packaging needs a redesign, including the graphic design.",1484352000,,424,4.653333333333333
