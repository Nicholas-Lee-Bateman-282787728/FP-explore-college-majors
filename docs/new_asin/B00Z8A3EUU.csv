8719608,1,B00Z8A3EUU,"I'm giving this one star because I'm a victim of the old bait and switch apparently. ""Pink Floyd: The Syd Barrett Experiment"" is really ""Syd Barrett: Under Review."" As documentaries go, the movie itself is satisfactory, but it's full of music critics for the most part droning on. The interview with Hugh Hopper (from Soft Machine who played on Madcap) was good. I've seen Under Review a few times. When I saw this, I thought I was getting a newly released documetary on Syd, of whom I'm a big fan. Fradulanty, that is not the case. If you've seen Under Review, do NOT buy this.",1485129600,3,578,4.514285714285714
