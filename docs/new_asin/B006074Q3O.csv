4912424,5,B006074Q3O,"Wonderfully made documentary. I think all parents should homeschool their kids. Its all about patience and a willingness to learn alongside your children.  It is much less expensive then sending them to public schools. No fundraising, unnecessary field trip fees, book fees, bus fees etc.  The latest and greatest clothes so they fit in with peers.... You can spend as little or as much as you want on home education. With free sites like Khan academy, school yourself and the local library. Documentaries available on youtube, the library, Netflix, Amazon prime tv etc. And my children have so much more time now to visit with friends then they did when they were trapped in school all week.

While it can be viewed as ""boring"" because it's a documentary, and his accent can be a little tricky to understand at times, I really recommend this movie for anyone interested in Homeschooling, or even if you like Public School.

It is a very slow, subtle and deliberate dumbing down indoctrinations to turn our kids into following, aimless atheists.  Government schools have an agenda and that's to control and guide our thinking so they can get bigger and and get away with their garbage.  It is so convoluted and subtle what our government is up to that most of the public have no idea the devastation they are causing their children, their children's future, America's future. It's all a process to taking over, to having us be slaves as George Sorros and all of the other big corrupt corporations are working on.  This is what Adolf Hitler did to brainwash his people; he took control of the schools and mainstream media.  Ah, people, that is where we have been and where we are now.  Freaky thinking about it.

4912438,4,B006074Q3O,"I think whether you identify as a Christian or not, this is a well produced documentary on the history of public education in this country.  I don't think any Christian parent will find any new information here regarding the lack of any faith-based foundation for learning. Many good points are brought up not only from a Christian perspective but also from educators who provide insight on how the current system is failing to even educate children properly, aside from any religious controversy.  While the government narrative states that schools are neutral, the Bible teaches that there can be no neutrality when it comes to God. You are either for him or against him.  I think that is what Christian parents need to keep in mind: if your child is in the public schools, than everyday is a fight for their morals and beliefs. The current public education system has strong communist and atheist roots and this history is what I think most people will be surprised to learn. The documentary highlights the 2 camps of Christian thinking in regards to public education - to be the light of Christ in the darkness of secular schools or to be separate all together, it does lean heavily toward separation. Not everyone can afford private schools and most are not equipped to homeschool. Perhaps the increasing online options might be a middle ground. While I understand those k-12 years are clearly the most formative, eventually we all have to live and function in a godless culture that is showing increasing hostility towards Chiristians. I think it provides good food for thought and is well worth watching.

I wanted to address one reviewer who so eloquently stated he could not see the connection between evolution and school shootings. When you remove the creator and teach generations that they are just random organisms with no purpose, there is no longer a respect for life. As evolution has become the ""standard"" with it came abortion and now we're seeing the rise of euthanasia for the sick, disabled and elderly. Yes there is a connection and it goes far beyond the classroom. We see it everyday in random shootings all over the country. This is the result of ""neutral"" public education without any moral foundation.",1466208000,,2229,4.888888888888889

4912441,3,B006074Q3O,"Great Commission Films, has released a documentary called IndoctriNation that exposes the left-winged prejudice against the Christian ideology in government schools.
Movie Description :
Colin Gunn, a homeschool father, take a journey across the USA to look deeply into the public education system.  Along with his family, they drive a school bus across the country on a massive road trip; they spend a lot of time on the coasts.  Their view is that since most Christian children attend a public school, their families should get involved in what it being taught at the public schools - that the schools are becoming anti-Christian, and something needs to be done.  The documentary features interviews with school officials, parents, and ""whistleblowers"" who share their testimonies.  It is a highly controversial film.
Thoughts :
I watched this movie with my husband; we did not consider it to be a movie for our children.  Older children might get something out of it, but not our younger children.  We only watched it once, and felt that once may have been one too many times...

First off, this movie made me proud to be a homeschool parent.  It's a difficult task, and one that doesn't get a lot of thanks.  (That's not to say that being a school teacher is any easier...but when was the last time you had Homeschool Teacher Appreciation Week?  And sick days are a joke.  It's a different beast.)  However, I know that my efforts will come to fruition in children that can think for themselves, and look at the world differently.  I don't want children that are ""socialized,"" if socialization means that they are a carbon copy of every other child at the school.  I want them to be curious, question everything, and learn not to accept words at face value.  Sometimes I get judged for that...

Many things in the film made me tearful, mostly because it hit some nails on the head. We live in a socialist nation. Children spend more time in school then they do with their families. Who do you think has the greatest influence over your children?  Only you know your children best, so don't settle for less than that. The government wants their hand in everything, including your children's brains, to teach them the ways of the world. Without alternative schooling methods, this could easily transition into the mass-conformation movement of 1930's and 1940's Germany, where a political leader had more clout than God himself.  The ""world"" is corrupt; I want my children to follow their faith and be a blessing to the world around them.  If you're having doubts about your abilities, or rationale, for homeschooling, this film will bolster your confidence!

That said, the film would have been better if it had aimed for a wider Christian audience than just those who get behind ""creationism.""  I was looking forward to the movie, but got hung up on the film maker's insistence on the ideas that the earth was created in ""only seven days"" and that ""every word of the Bible is true"". Most Christian's have no problem folding Darwinism into ""God's methods"" and putting the metaphor of ""God"" above man's deductive interpretations of our collective experience.  By focusing solely on creationism, the film severely limits its reach to a wider population.

Also, the film doesn't point out anything that public schools are doing right, but chooses to focus on all of the things that they are doing wrong.  In my experience, when faced with ""all or nothing"" thinking, I choose to ignore the argument and walk away.  Nothing is black or white; it's grey.  I would have been more open-minded to listening to their message if they had been willing to concede some positives on the side they were attacking.  They negate religions other than Christianity, when my belief is that a person is good or bad, regardless of their chosen religion.  There are good and bad Christians; there are good and bad Muslims; there are good and bad atheists.  A little less focus on religion itself (I would even have gone for morality), and a little more focus on the broken system, would have been preferable.  Also, I'd like to point out that if you choose to remove your child from public school for the sole purpose of teaching Creationism and Christianity as the only way, then you are, in fact, indoctrinating them yourself.  Overall, I give it a B-.",1452816000,4,4333,4.830623306233062

Kids are bombarded with so many adult issues that were shielded from me when I was a child.  It is terrible how children are exploited and given ""adult"" information at such a young age.  They have lost their innocence.

This video really brought to light all of the corruption and ""indoctrination"" of the public schools on your nation's children.  I would highly recommend it to any parent who cares what is being taught in the public schools to their children.  I would also tell parents to get your children out of the public schools and into a private school or Christian private school or homeschool them if possible.  I would not want any child of mine exposed to such evil.  It would be so counterproductive to any morals or values I would want to instill in them.",1435708800,,912,4.4787878787878785

This movie takes a good honest look at what is really happening to your students.  Bullying, peer pressure, stress, potential for shooters.  Equally important is what is happening to their souls because of the removal of Christian values from education. The movie entertainingly follows the gradual ""evolution"" of our schools to secular, Marxist and Darwinist ideology.  Make no mistake, indoctrination of your child into a secular religion is occurring. And it has consequences as revealed in the Columbine massacre which occurred at the hands of a fellow student who was a Darwinist.  Well done by Collin Gunn who at the end smashes the yellow schoolbus much to the entertainment of my kids.

Who do you think has the greatest influence over your child? You or a stranger? Only you know your child best, don't settle for less than that. The government wants their hand in everything including your childs brain so they can teach them the ways of the world. Well ""this world"" is corrupt and I want no part of the government teaching my child not to follow God. I don't want some stranger teaching my kid about sex education. Thanks but no thanks, that's a parent's job. I understand some parents don't want this task and that's fine but that's not my problem nor should my child be subjected to it. Blessed homeschool mom of 11yrs. If you want to homeschool your child God can and will make it happen. Have faith you don't need to settle for less for your child. I homeschooled as a single mom while working full time for yrs. I took proverbs 22:6 to heart and applied it. God will Not leave you high and dry when you follow His word. I'm saying this to encourage you. You will ALWAYS face judgement as a homeschooler, that's a given. But step out of the norm of society and be radical. Your end result will be an individual who does not follow the crowd, is unique and not a carbon copy of everyone else. On that note I want to say I have a few friends who teach in the public schools and I truly respect them. This is no easy task. However all of them agree on one thing, they'd prefer if they could homeschool their own children. What does that say to you?

The government is under no mandate to preach god (a concept with no observational or scientific evidence) to all of its citizens... actually, we were tired of government shoving one religion down our throat and founded a new country with that being the first thing stated they weren't allowed to do, but history be damned. Get religion at church (if you desire, morals, charity, community, etc.) and leave education alone. Facts are facts, they don't take religious or liberal biases; it's simply data, numbers, and written history.

4912521,5,B006074Q3O,"Being homeschooled and having only gone through the first 3 grades in the public school system, I have been somewhat desensitized to what goes on in public education and what kind of effect it as having on children. I recall that in the 1st and 2nd grades, I would often not tell my parents of the things I was hearing and going through at school, preferring to only discuss the good. Students would make fun of me and call me mean, crude names which I often didn't understand. Eventually, God led us to homeschooling, which has enabled me the opportunity to learn and grow mentally, physically, socially, and spiritually, in ways I could never have at a public school. As a result of homeschooling, God has called me to creation ministry to teach people (particularly youth) about the truth of God's creation as described in His Word. Creation ministry has exposed me to much of the indoctrination that is going on in the public schools. But I never knew it was this bad.

In the appropriately-named documentary, IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America, Scottish filmmaker and homeschool father Colin Gunn takes you on a field trip you never can--or will--forget...no matter how hard you try. Using the allegory of (and driving around in) a big yellow school bus, Gunn Productions will lead you through the roots--and fruits--of the public school system in America, demonstrating the reason why education in America is rotten to the core: because, ""The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction,"" the latter of which American public schools have chosen to follow. By taking apart the history and philosophies of the public school system piece-by-piece, IndoctriNation exposes what ideas and values helped to shape the classrooms of America today, and how a secular mindset has taken over every inch of the public education system, from the standard grade system and testing, to the way classrooms are organized. The fruits of such a mindset is shocking. Poor grades, general illiteracy, school violence, and drugs to name just a few.

Christian parents often believe that if their children go to church and Sunday school, and then get sent to school for the other 5 days of the week, then they will be fine. Most Christian parents would be led to believe that their children are being ""salt and light"" in their school. IndoctriNation points out the flaws in this thinking, showing how, in order to preserve the next generation of Christian young people, we must not let their minds be taken captive to the mindset of the day (Colossians 2:8) and instead, ""Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it"" (Proverbs 22:6).

Here are some things that I personally noted about IndoctriNation:

- While much has been written about the public school system from a Christian perspective, Colin Gunn has put together all of this research and information in a format which is easily accessible and comprehensible for parents and students.
- The documentary style is easy-to-watch and always keeps you on your feet.
- The experts who were interviewed provided a professional and intriguing look into different aspects of the public education system, from education styles, to history, doctrine, morals, and much more.

Conclusion: Every Christian parent needs to watch this documentary. It will shake the way they view education in America. No longer would parents so easily allow their children to be spiritually ""slaughtered by the masses"" in the classroom. I can testify to this, as I once was in line to be robbed of my faith by the lies and indoctrination which is taught in public schools, but by God's grace, He called my parents to homeschool me and my brother. Ever since, God has grown our faith and relationship with Him and has given us a far-better education, social life, and atmosphere in which to share the truth and truly be ""salt and light."" All in all, I would recommend that any parent and high school student should watch this video--and then share it with others.

However, some of the interviews suggest the film maker's advocacy of the ideas that the earth was created in ""only seven days"" and that ""every word of the Bible is true"". These views severely constrict the delivery of an otherwise potent message to a very few people who manage to exclude scientific thought from their critical thinking process. Most Christian's I know have no problem folding Darwinism into ""God's methods"" and putting the metaphor of ""God"" above man's deductive interpretations of our collective experience.

If you watched Indoctrination and you want to know more, the first and best place to start is by reading John Taylor Gatto's book: The Underground History of American Education.

Gatto's book is absolutely shocking and truthful. It covers the background, philosophy, psychology, politics, and purpose of compulsory, mass-education. The book has an index and a section discussing his research and the books and sources he used.

If you buy Gatto's book, before you start reading at the beginning, go to the end and read the section ""About The Books I Used"". He cites 400 sources in the book alone. He also gives his top 29 that he recommends the reader read first [after reading The Underground History of American Education]. Hope this helps.

I proceeded to question Nieces and Nephews and grandchildren on subjects that you would think would be mandatory. They did not have a clue. Then we found a homeschool grade assessment test,they all participated in taking this test. The senior highs placed in middle school,and the middle schoolers placed in elementary school levels. The parents were astonished at what their kids were actually NOT learning. None of the upper high schoolers had heard of Mao,Hitler,or Stalin. They had no idea,some said they sounded familiar but could not recollect. Of all of the children that took this test ,ALL of the parents now homeschool,and better informed about what is before them in teaching their children basic subjects. The school system is a powerful bureaucracy,threaded with tenure,pension,ect. The system is dumbing children down,purposes that are clearly seen. Sexual orientation training,contraceptives,and abortion referrels,not to mention the mass drugging of young boys. It is truly a sad state,and Indoctrination does a very fine job of bringing these problematic issues to folks that don't insist on looking the other way.

I live in California, so if I want the Christian values that I teach my children at home to actually stick AND I want them to actually learn something (read, write..) then it was a no brainer to decide to homeschool.  Our public schools are pathetic, although, there are some well meaning teachers, it's just too hard to get over the political agenda that is being pushed in our schools.  As parents, I think some are blind to think that we can over come what happens to our children in public schools, not just what is being taught but the environment that are kids are subjected to (drugs, violence, sex etc etc).  In the film, it talks about the small percentage of  Christian children that actually retain their faith after being products of the public school system, that was pretty overwhelming to me.  Plus, it was interesting to hear what is going on in other parts of the country and the personal stories.

This film was eye opening but engaging and funny as well.  My husband has always thought I was kidding about homeschooling, until he saw this film and decided it was a must for our children.

People talk about our children being ""salt and light"" in the public school system, but that's not possible.  Poor souls are just being corrupted and persecuted.

""Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.""  This film shows case after case where children and teachers are forced to give up their beliefs or face consequences. They almost never convert anyone to Christianity, but they are converted to worldly unbelief and sinful behavior at a staggering rate. A home school curriculum is by far the best way to educate your child. The books are so much more comprehensive than what public schools use, and are not full of revisionist propaganda that you find in government indoctrination. Public schools have their agenda set by the state or federal government, not the parents. If you really want a great curriculum for a reasonable price, Christian Liberty Academy has an entire year's books averaging just over $200 for the entire Curriculum Kit for each grade. They will even grade the tests, and issue a high school diploma if you want to go that route. There are great home school groups and activities out there for kids to stay in the good social circles, skipping the sex, drugs, and Darwinist crowds clogging the halls of public schools. If you love God and love your kids, choose home education. As the film states, ""Our children are the only treasures we can take with us to heaven"".

4912558,4,B006074Q3O,"The documentary involves Colin Gunn, a homeschooling dad who hails from Scotland, loading his family up on a schoolbus and going around the country to talk to all kinds of people.  Some are well-known in homeschooling circles, like John Taylor Gatto, Ken Ham, and Voddie Baucham.  As a homeschooler for the past dozen years, they really didn't say anything I haven't heard before.

For me, it was the stories told by regular people that hit me.  A very popular elementary school teacher.  A recent graduate of a highly rated public school.  Another teacher.  A regular working-man type of dad.  A school principal.  People who DO know what is going on in the schools.

The main message of the documentary is basically that as Christians, we have to get our kids out of the public school system.  That's a message that makes me squirm.  I mean, we have made the decision to homeschool, but I struggle enough with my family, you know?  I'm not sure that I'm capable of making any kind of recommendation about schooling choices to anyone else.

But one thing I do feel comfortable saying is: ""You have to be aware.""  I think this documentary can really, really make you think.  To think long and hard about what the real situation is for our kids in the schools.

I know, the tendency is to believe that these things are not happening here.  People just northwest of me, up in Denver, believed that.  It's been over a decade since Columbine, but the last few months have been challenging.  The movie theater shooting in Aurora this summer.  The abduction of a sweet 10 year old girl just this past week.

For me, these drive home the point that horrible things are happening in my community.

The DVD runs just 102 minutes, and honestly I think every Christian parent should see it.

4912559,4,B006074Q3O,"I had a very hard time with this book.

Just being honest.

Indoctrination: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity is a companion book to the DVD by the same title. I have watched it and it is just as disturbing as the book.

Disturbing, however is not bad.

In this book and accompanying DVD, the filmmakers and editor have compiled a combination of first-hand interviews and article/book excerpts into one vast resource regarding the history and state of public education in America.

Learning more about the history of American public education was quite enlightening to me...and disturbing as well.

I am one of the many Americans who has truly no choice (due to poor past financial decisions) other than to send my child to a public school. He has been blessed with great teachers and a great education thus far, but don't think for a minute that I don't have concern for what he hears or will hear in the classrooms he attends - both from teachers and other students. Thus the reason I try my best to diligently #TeachtheTruth in our daily lives in whatever ways God allows and leads me to.

Still, the government-guided school system has my child for more total, undivided time than I do if you factor in all of the other things that go on before and after school.

IndoctriNation brings to light how deliberate my situation is.

No, I do not deliberately choose to let the God-forsaking United States government indoctrinate and mold my child into becoming the kind of humanistic (man-centered) citizen they want to create, but they do deliberately structure our education system in such as way that what I described is highly likely to happen to most children who spend 12 formative years in this government created, government led system. If you don't think that is true, I challenge you to read my review of Already Gone by Ken Ham& Britt Beemer and read that book for more detailed survey results that prove it. Maybe many of the people who work in or have children in this system don't agree with that statement, but just a few pages into the book IndoctriNation will bring to light some things that were put in place many many years ago which have us already socialized in ways we don't even realize.

Again, though, I had a very tough time with this book. Not just for reasons I have described but also because the filmmakers and editor, in their notes of introduction to the book and even a couple of the authors of book portions, conveyed a tone that I did not agree with. I understand their passion for conveying this important message, but in their words some of them seemed to forget about parents like me. They wrapped all parents of publicly educated children into this package group of being ""deceived"" and lazy / careless about our children's education.

One such statement stands out that I would like to rebut, if I may.

Editor Charles LaVerdiere states, ""Previous generations of 'We the People' gladly handed over their children, first to the one-room schoolhouse then to the government, all for convenience.""

If anyone in those previous generations was like me, I can say that not all ""gladly"" handed their children over and likely not so much for ""convenience"" as much as out of necessity. I struggle internally daily with having to be far less involved with my child's daily schooling than I would like (not even being able to be on campus at his public school as much as I would like due to work obligations). And the public school system is not so much a convenience to me as it is a necessity. Poor financial decisions of my past when I was younger and even single have affected me and continue to affect our family in a way that we are unable to afford living on one income nor can we even afford a private school (not that private schools are the perfect option either).

All that said, I stuck with the book and was very thankful I did. MANY important facts brought to light in the nearly 400 pages of this book as well as the nearly 2 hours of DVD that accompanies it. You truly should delve into this one if you have children of any age in or near ""school days.""

And for some reason, the real truth of what happens behind closed doors in the class rooms has managed to escape public scrutiny.
Parents are under the mistaken impression that THEIR child's school is 'different' and that bad stuff only happens in those 'other' schools. But they are NOT being told what is happening inside the classrooms. They believe their child tells them what's going on but that is a mistaken impression and should not be overlooked if they care about the well being of their child.
This documentary left me wanting to yell out to every parent with children, urging them to pull them out of public schools and either home school or send them to private or Christian church schools.
If I had young children I would do everything in my power to see that they escaped the indoctrination of the public school system as it made me cringe watching the truth unfold in this well made documentary.

This is the first time I have ever watched a Colin Gunn documentary and I can only say good things about it. It's  informative, academic, educational and highly stimulating approach to such a controversial topic drives this film smoother than the most modern yellow bus. Colin Gunn appears to have a strong passion for individual cognition, liberty, freedom, and not suprisingly Christian values. For some of us who are not aware of the degradation of the American public school system or who might be in profound denial should carefully view this film. I feel this film raises more questions than answers and further leads a prospective viewer into more different topics that are all relevant to this on going crisis. It is not far fetched to say that Colin Gunn is very aware of this.

Colin Gunn handles the yellow school bus quite nicely; moreover, he packs it with his wife and seven of his own children to tour the nation and research the present school system. He speaks and interviews all the different walks of educational and professional life; principles, pastors, theologicans, and teachers (John Taylor Gatto, one of my favorite interviews) ect. There are many topics to discuss and debate here but what I thought was so prevalently dominant in Colin Gunn's message was how he exposes the detrimental effects of a population without a unifying and binding culture. Or more specifically, what happens when a system of Christian values is replaced by something secular and scientific that is based on man's opinions as opposed to a higher power. What are the consequences ?

4912574,5,B006074Q3O,"This documentary is of superb quality.  I love how the producer intertwines the history of public school together with the story of the used bus he bought off Craigslist.  The Scottish accent is great and he has an awesome sense of humor.  There are many great guests in this film, including my favorite, John Taylor Gatto.  (For those interested in the history of public school in America, read Gatto's ""The Underground History of American Education,"" and ""Weapons of Mass Instruction; you can also find Gatto on YouTube.)  I bought Indoctrination along with another Gunn film about media's affect on children, Captivated.  I gave both five-star ratings, but enjoyed this film more.  Indoctrination is hard-hitting, speaks truth to power, and from my own research on the subject matter, is factually correct.

This film is a must-see for all Christians.  If you know a Christian who has their kids in public school, buy this documentary for them as soon as you finish reading this review.  People who follow Jesus and believe the Bible need to know that, once they subject their children to government-run schools, they are playing Russian Roulette with their childrens' souls; but when it comes to public school, there are numerous chambers and only one of them is empty.  This documentary points out what believers innately believe: if you send your children to public school, the odds of them being corrupted by the world far outweigh the odds of them converting worldly kids to Christ.  How many public school kids do you know that got saved from the testimony of a Christian classmate?  One?  Two?  But we all know scores of Christian children who fell into drugs, alcohol, sex, violence and atheism.

The way I see it, Christians are afraid to pull their children out of public school for two reasons: 1.) they are afraid that they are not smart enough to teach their kids, and 2.) they mistakenly believe they can't afford it.

1.) As this film points out, public school kids are not learning anything.  My wife and I have four college degrees between us, and I am finishing up another this year.  When I look around at my fellow students, I am shocked about how little college kids know these days.  Clearly, they are learning very little in public school.  Do not take my word for it.  I challenge you to enroll in one freshmen class at the university or community college nearest to you.  You will discover that 1.) the material is easy and dumbed-down and 2.) 95% of the students are dumb as rocks.  I am not trying to be mean here--these are just the hard, cold facts.  Once you see how easy college is, it will boost your confidence that you can teach your kids better than the public schools are teaching everyone else's.

2.) Everybody can afford to homeschool.  Again, I am not trying to be mean here, just brutally honest.  The reason people can't afford to homeschool is because they value material goods over their childrens' well being.  Homeschooling requires a situation where one parent does not work.  Unfortunately, these days two parents have to work because they choose to pay for a mortgage on a house and keep up on payments on two new vehicles.  The bottom-line is that they covet houses and cars that are out of their price range.  They could afford to live on one parent's income if they rented a trailer or apartment, bought used cars, and did not eat out everyday.  So what is it going to be parents?  Getting in debt for material junk so that you both have to work?  Or living a simpler lifestyle so that you can protect your children from the horrors of government schools?",1329177600,29,3610,4.7216

4912580,5,B006074Q3O,"As a product (or survivor) of government education and private schooling, I was compelled to learn the actual history of government-sponsored education in America.

The early history of our nation includes people who taught their children the skills necessary to live and serve their fellow man.  This was all subverted in the name of uniformity (egalitarianism) by the introduction of the centralized education.  Individualism is frowned upon, ""universal knowledge"" is taught (often in spite of factual history) and students are prepared for their ultimate roles as pawns in a giant corporate machine.  Students are trained to submit, never question authority and always obey.  This is fine in a military environment, where such response training can mean the difference between life and death.

However, in the world of education and culture, such training can kill a culture.

I was raised in the Northeast and always thought my education was at least adequate (if not superior).  Once I started home-schooling my own children (for religious reasons), I saw the result of propaganda in my own background - the over-simplification of significant history (for example: were you taught that the War Between the States was only about slavery?)

This film not only confirms our decision to educate our children ourselves, but gives me the historical background to reject the very principle of government-sponsored education.  I was ignorant of the true origins of government education - this film was truly eye-opening.

Following Colin Gunn around the country proved to be a thought-provoking journey into our country's history - full of surprises and aspects of the subject that the ordinary student (or parent) would not necessarily consider.

I heartily recommend this film to anyone presently involved with the government education system (student, parent, educator or administrator) as a vehicle for evaluation of their current circumstances and to consider making changes in their situation.  There is certainly more than meets the eye in America's schools - this film brings that message from credible sources who have been on the inside of the system.

Kudos to producers Colin Gunn and Joaquin Fernandez for presenting a controversial topic with even-handedness, factual data and enough interpretation (but not enough to cloud the viewer's thinking) about this important subject.",1327622400,12,2387,5.43360433604336

Just brought home to me that nothing happens in a vacuum.  It is not just that those leading the way are misguided with good intentions; they are really out to create (And have created) a dumb down society of workers.  You will have your eyes opened after watching this.

4912582,5,B006074Q3O,"For full disclosure, we do homeschool our children, so understand that I have a bias in that direction.  However, there is indeed a reason for that bias, and this film does a good job of exposing the root of *why* many people choose to homeschool, whether they do so because of religious reasons or simply because they see the fruit of what the ""system"" is producing.  Whichever direction you choose, understand that there is an public education agenda going on which you should not be blind to.  The education system is not just there to help your child reach *their* highest potential, but rather is primarily there to define *what* such an individual looks like.  And you may not like what the model output looks like.  Do your own research and verify the claims asserted in this documentary.  If you decide that you like the agenda, then by all means embrace it.  However, I have a different model that I measure my children against and it is radically different than what the education machine is producing.",1327622400,13,1012,4.715909090909091

4912584,5,B006074Q3O,"In the course of my life, I have forced myself many times to re-think the foundations of my life in order to become more in line with what the Bible calls me to be. I was raised in the public education system. As a newly converted Christian after high school, I realized just how far from the mark I was living, much to do with the influence I received through public education. So many habits formed in public school that made life in Christ a struggle, and so many decisions that have had far reaching implications both in my life and in the life of my family have made my journey toward righteous living immensely more difficult than they had to be.

This film gives a fair and honest assessment of the public school system. What they have pointed out, I have experienced. While it may be news to some that the public school is systematically providing a pagan worldview to children, to those of us who truly care about the Word of God as the only rule for faith and life, this is only a reminder. Every Christian should see this film, and take it's warning seriously. It's not a outlandish or radical documentary seeking to scare people into a dogmatic view of education. It is a map that leads it's viewers through history, putting two and two together, weaving a dark tapestry of secular humanism, socialism, atheism and and agenda from long ago to win your kids hearts and minds.",1327276800,6,1386,4.5
4912585,5,B006074Q3O,"I wish I could get it into the hands of every parent in our country.  It's a very realistic look at the public school system, but not done in an arrogant way.  It's interesting, quaint, touching, surprising at times (esp. at the end, quite a powerful visual is used that I didn't quite expect).  The movie is thorough too--not just addressing all the major problems facing our children in the schools, but getting down to the nitty gritty root causes and what ultimately has to happen.

The filmmaker, Colin Gunn, takes his family on a giant fieldtrip in a big, old, yellow school bus he purchased for the project.  They talk to so many people, including Christian teachers/principal, and a retired teacher-of-the-year (twice) from the Manhattan schools, who gives sage advice.  You also get a cartoon-chalk-board style history of the school system in America, with ""animated"" quotes from different historical figures along the way--I was surprised by one of the quotes--quite an insightful prediction from 125 years ago.  Best of all, you see how if Jesus Christ is prohibited and thrown out, there's no way to be ""salt and light""--you can't bring the system back without Him! ( And, it's not the State who we want in control of our children anyway. ) It's interesting that it's Jesus' name that offends--God, Allah, Buddha--they're are all fine, but not Jesus Christ.

Anyway, I hope you're able to get this/loan it to your church leaders, friends, etc.  I thought it was well done without trying to offend--if the truth offends, that's one thing, but we can present it in a gracious way.  God help us get our country back for Him!",1326758400,12,1633,4.82078853046595
4912586,5,B006074Q3O,"When I saw the trailer for this movie online a while back my first thought was, ""Come on. This is a no-brainer.""  I thought it would be showing the value of home schooling over public schools.  In my life I've met one home-schooled kid who wasn't miles ahead of his public-educated  counterparts, but when I met his mother it all fell into place.  And to be clear, my kids aren't home-schooled; they go to a Classical Christian academy- one of the board members let me watch his copy on dvd and now I plan on buying my own.

Anyway, when I watched IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America I learned that, not only are public schools just lousy places of education, there is an agenda to corrupt the minds of our children and, you guessed it, indoctrinate them.  Using video and film footage of classrooms, speeches by the NEA leaders and newscasts from various American television stations we see how apathy and indifference from the parents have allowed the lunatics to take over the asylum.  Actually, that's not accurate: they BUILT the asylum in the first place and they've worked hard to keep anyone who disagrees with them on the outside.

IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America argues that that's exactly where we should stay- outside the asylum.  As Christians we believe that the whole world is worthy of hearing the Gospel- and that's absolutely true.  However we think that sending our children into dangerous territory at a time in their life when they can't always discern true is a good idea.  We're trying to salt a truckload of onions.  Then we're surprised at how many of our children leave the church or live lives of outright disobedience.

Colin Gunn takes his family on a roadtrip across America to seek out the truth about public education and reveals so much more than we imagined he could.  He makes stops in Boston, where the mess started, Dayton, Tennessee, where the Scopes trial took place and Denver, where the inevitable result of secular, humanistic teaching took place at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999.

IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America is entertaining as well as being informational.  Of course our friends in the public education field will disagree or say they're the exception to what's presented here, but I think the movie presents itself in a clear way, leaving little room for argument.  My hope is that they will just admit it and move on.  If someone says that there isn't a targeted attack on Christianity just ask them if you can come lead a Bible study at the school.

In Green Bay, Wisconsin the local fish-wrap/newspaper showed a picture (front page no less) of two Muslim children at an elementary school praying in the hallway.  A week later the ""Tebowing"" furor began.  Proof, if proof were needed, that our education system hates the name of Jesus Christ and will accept anything BUT Christianity in it's hallowed halls.
