7953113,4,B00005S6KE,"Good Kung Fu movie, set during the notorious Qing Dynasty.  There are some story continuity issues.  The ""sister"" character in the promo picture is never developed--she appears at the beginning and at the end.  But, it is a good movie for this genre and with an interesting plot twist at the end.",1482278400,,296,4.653846153846154
7953114,2,B00005S6KE,"This is fior the VOD version. A story about how an emperor tries to eliminate his opposition. Mostly about the emperor trying to kill all the monks and some of the monks fighting back, there is also a sister of the emperor who is trying to kill him, but we only see her at the beginning and the very end, otherwise no mention of her at all. The special effects are bad, but standard for this genre. There is a scene towards the end that is way too long (for more than one reason). This is a dubbed version so don't expect the dialogue to make any sense (or most of the movie for that matter).  Some of these movies are enjoyable despite the inane dialogue and the 4:3 pan and scan view and others are just lousy, this is one is somewhere in-between.",1475971200,,749,4.201388888888889

7953117,4,B00005S6KE,"It's a fairly simple and not unique story - Bad guy emperor burns down the Shaolin Temple and kills most of the monks and the survivors seek revenge.  Even if not unique, this is one fun movie to watch unless you are really picky and complain about every little thing.  The production values are surprisingly high here.  If you didn't know better you might guess it's a Shaw Brothers film just from the sets and high quality acting but no, it's not Shaw Brothers.  There's a lot more story than action here, so that's one thing some IMDB reviewers have complained about.  The story line is coherent although there are a few minor holes in the plot as some characters disappear and then reappear with no real explanation.

Almost certainly this is a DVD made in the very early years of DVD manufacture.  It's by Mei Ah Laser Disc Video Company and the fact that they used Laser Disc in the company name gives you an idea of how old this probably was.  It's a single layer, region free NTSC DVD that is widescreen but NOT anamorphic.  That means it's widescreen but encoded in a 4:3 window instead of a 16:9 window.  Again, this DVD seems to be very old so high definition TVs weren't around then, hence the 4:3 window.  Soundtrack is Mandarin only.  That's a plus for me as I don't enjoy the cheesy English dubs of the time (the film came out in 1976) at all.  The soundtrack is clean.  Subtitles are in Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English.  I can't read Chinese so I can't speak for the quality there, but the English subtitles are not perfect.  They're mostly good but there are spelling errors (""a"" for ""s"" substitutions happens quite often) and some grammar problems at times, but you shouldn't really have any problems understanding what is meant.  Picture quality is really good with a shockingly clean copy of the film being used, but again, this is encoded in a 4:3 window so stretching it to 16:9 will introduce some distortion.  If you're the type to get completely hung up over the 4:3 encode, the subtitle issues or the ""more story than action"" aspects then this isn't for you, but for me this was some really nice entertainment I highly recommend.",1469491200,,2175,4.590673575129534
7953118,3,B00005S6KE,"Compared to Joseph Kuo's other films that came out after this one, I didn't think this one had as much action. I also thought the ending was a bit rushed. But it is a great start to the bronze man series. ""The 18 Bronze Men"", ""Return of the 18 Bronze Men"" and ""The  Unbeaten 28"" were much better. The movie stars Carter Wong and Chang Yi.",1384646400,,338,4.121212121212121
7953119,5,B00005S6KE,"Cowboys vs. Indians, - ehr, well Shaolin vs. Manchus. Manchu emperor destroys Shaolin Temple - surviving monks seek revenge.

Predictable, but well produced. Cinematically nice scenes of destruction (good special effects), and good fighting choreography. Definitely one of the better kung-fu movies.

Good DVD quality, too. Clean film transfer, nice bright colors, good soundtrack (Chinese/mandarin), choice of subtitles (English, traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese).

Good all around kung-fu fun!",1293235200,2,502,6.352941176470588
7953120,4,B00005S6KE,"I though this flick was just o.k,,,,,I'm not sure about a 5 star,,,as is claimed by the previous reviewer!! The dvd transfer is not the greatest, the choreography is accepatble, however, the plot I though was very impressive,,as the previous reviewer quote ' AMBITIOUS"",,I duly agree!!  Definately a good movie to check out,,,see Carter Wong performed brilliantly!!",1152662400,,365,5.4035087719298245
