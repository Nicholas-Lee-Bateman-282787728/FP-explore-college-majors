2569646,5,B000FJTVC4,"This movie from first-time director Jamie Fessenden shows a lot of promise, with thrills, chills and laughs to spare.  This is a story about a small New England town and the secrets that are sometimes buried in such places---as well as the secrets we keep buried from others.  The dialogue is easy-paced and well-written, the actors seems comfortable with their roles, and the editing and direction show an insight that lends anticipation to further projects.  The chemistry between the two male leads often lends the movie some of its tension as well as some of its more casual, easier moments.  The atmosphere is spooky and creepy (as are a good many of the characters), and there are genuine ""boo!"" moments---along with moments that are so over the top they're good.  I did have some issues with the sound and a couple of the lesser cast members, but all in all, I think this is an extremely solid first feature---and a hell of a lot of fun.",1149552000,8,944,4.662650602409639

I do have one question though....why does Hollywood keep putting Cuba Gooding in movies, as the headliner yet? he has moments of a good performance now and then but certainly not in this movie. I thought that the real star was Devon Bostick. this kid did a great job in the capacity that was given to him. All in all it isn't a bad movie just paced like a snail and I got real bored seeing Cuba with the same puss on his face through the movie. he has a hard time emoting these days. It was predictable and if you don't mind seeing Christian Slater as a befuddled priest then go for it. Be warned not for everyone or maybe not for anyone. the vigilante cop thing has gotten overdone and this one it is very possible we could have lived without.",1457222400,,765,4.210884353741497

I'm begining to wonder about Millennium Films. I have not yet seen any of their productions that I could say were any good. I'll keep watching Millennium Films for a little longer but, so far, not so good.

It turns out that Amazon reviewers generally hit the target in their reviews. It appears quite worth one's time reading what others have to say before spending money on products. A lesson learned here.",1316217600,,549,4.5353535353535355

2569765,1,B000FJTVC4,"I'm a big Cuba Gooding fan and was sorry to see he'd accepted a role in this terrible movie... He's obviously dropped his standards to an all time low.  This movie was filmed the majority of the time in a strip club, with several side shows of people doing the deed (couples, threesomes, in the bathroom & anywhere else they can find). Oh, and lets not forget the Virgin Mary that is INSIDE the CHURCH weeping and the members think it's a miracle from God... actually it's because she's full of cocaine!  Then the Priest (Christian Slater) agrees to participate in a plot to kill the drug dealers, & allows it to take place INSIDE the CHURCH!!!  There's a big shootout scene where the priest is actually chasing the bad guys between the pews, shooting & killing them.  I feel the description of the movie is VERY misleading... while there's a LITTLE of the ""story"" described in the plot, it leaves out all the JUNK that takes place the MAJORITY of the time.",1304208000,9,957,4.514450867052023
2569766,2,B000FJTVC4,"Cuba was an undercover cop separated from his family. He gets found out and his family is killed. Afterward, he teams up with Jack Daniels to live a miserable life as the Toronto police force's ""Dirty Harry light"". In the city there is a drug lord with a techno dance club, where sex can be had in the restrooms as lovers snort lines off each others body (you know the place). Mike, a young drug dealer wants out. He cares for his younger sister. He hijacks a statue of the Virgin Mary made of heroin paste and ransoms its location to his former employer (guess how that works out).

I didn't think Cuba could get a worse role after ""Hit List"", but I was wrong. After so many good films, he is getting dog after dog. It is time for a new agent. The film has the lousy plot of a disjointed grindhouse film, but none of the other qualities that make it watchable. During the argument/fight between two guys over who took the statue, the acting got so bad I had to ask, ""Was this really the best take? Couldn't they have shot the scene over?""

The movie pretends to make a statement on drug trafficking and redemption, but falls way short. 1 1/2 stars.",1304121600,,1149,4.314814814814815
2569767,3,B000FJTVC4,"Can you have a second chance to stop a tragedy?  After losing his wife and child, undercover cop John Hebron (Gooding Jr.) is struggling to forgive himself for not saving them.  After a similar crime takes place he is given a second chance.  After watching Cuba in ""Ticking Clock"", which I really liked, I had high hopes for this one.  I was a little disappointed.  The idea of the movie is very interesting, but the execution is lacking.  A plot that has so much potential ends up being slow moving and never given the push it needs to make it as interesting as it sounds.  This is not a terrible movie, but definatly not one of Cuba's best.  It would be nice to see him get out of the Seagal, Kilmer & Snipes-like direct-to-video movies though and back into main stream movies.  He has the talent for them still. I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.",1303862400,4,875,4.280487804878049
2569768,1,B000FJTVC4,"Amazon policy is to not talk about other critiques on a film here, but I must say the four glowing descriptions are by one-time reviewers, and I only looked into it because the film was just really that bad.

The story follows a depressed cop as he muddles through a strange turn of events in his post family-killed-by-the-bad-guys life. Christian Slater plays the cussing, drinking killer priest (all only in church though) and Kim Coates plays the bad guy. At the ten-minute mark the screening became almost a laugh track as so many things had already gone wrong; The BD clarity was DVD to below average quality, the sound had been mixed poorly in every scene, the writing was obviously being improvised (later proven so in the making-of), and the overall feel of the film was beneath the low-budget approach.

The long list of things that kept going wrong with the film made it to where I ended up offering the film for free and no customers were interested that had watched the clips. The music score drowned out dialogue, the flashbacks throughout the film of varying characters were cartoonish, and when the two main leads (Gooding and Slater) made it appear they were unhappy and miserable doing their parts - the film just becomes pointless. Kim Coates does save the day though, both in the film and in the making-of. The 11:49 minute supplement is also laughable as they left in all of the ""chaotic"" issues in making this film. But Kim gave a great snippet about knowing Gary Oldman years before and the advice shared by Gary to him, worth the watch just for that.

The packaging shows Region 1 coded (obviously Millenium does not even invest in making their BD art correct), the sound says 5.1 but I dispute even that, English and Spanish subs. Writing about this will seem like I am trying to find more things wrong with the film but mostly I was making sure the four planted reviews here were countered just a bit. Not even a renter.",1303516800,7,1945,4.631884057971014
2569769,4,B000FJTVC4,"I really liked this film!  I fully enjoyed it for what it is, an action indy film with some great performances!
Cuba Gooding did a great job as a tormented cop with a tragic history. I am always impressed with Cuba's intensity and commitment to every role he plays!  Devon Bostick as the kid who needs to get out of a bad situation played the line superbly, and Lara Daans was stunning, in both performance and her pure on screen smolder. I seriously recommend this independent film to anyone.",1302739200,3,493,4.52808988764045
2569770,4,B000FJTVC4,"I found this movie quite entertaining. I like the twist on the `bad guys' being all very well dressed, Hollywood con type. Lara Daans, the actress who plaid the club owner, drug-dealer, besides looking very sexy, gave a solid performance. I will watch it again!

2569771,1,B000FJTVC4,"I thought the movie was going to be good because of the actors. Christian Slater and Cuba Gooding Jr. occasionally produce good movies. But this one was very disappointing. It was obviously a very low budget film. The acting was  expecially bad by the supporting actors, but Cuba Gooding's acting was not convincing either, and at times laughably bad. Chiristian slater may have had a chance to act better if he had more than practally 10 lines in the whole film, his part was so small it was almost like a cameo. In fact the only person who seemed to realize they were in a movie and should be acting as such was Devon Bostick playing the part of mike a young criminal trying to take care of his sister. His performance was without a doubt the best in this film although that makes it sound better than it was. The next time i see the names of cuba , slater , or the director (and writer?!?!) Daiman Lee i will have a bad taste in my mouth and one less movie in my hand as I walk out of the store. All in all this movie's production cost speaks for the entire movie, 6.8 million most of which probally went to Cuba Gooding Jr's outright boring performance and Christian Slater's 10 lines.",1298851200,3,1189,4.331838565022421

I have watched few movies by the director, producer, writer and actor Damian Lee... I really enjoy his work (movie like National Lampoon, The Poet).

I watched this movie with some hardcore action lovers, what was good about the movie was, not only the acting and direction was fantastic but also the enetertainment value was just perfect (It was emotional, it was action packed, it was full of twists and turns.

I look forward for the release...

2569774,2,B000FJTVC4,"So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.

The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.

This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting, the writing, and the scenery. The very ending was convenient and made little sense as the great powers the lead was supposed to possess never played a major role.

I recommend avoiding this one. For a more sultry movie, try a DeCoteau - they may not be truly gay, but at least the quality is immensely better.",1176940800,3,734,4.462686567164179
2569775,5,B000FJTVC4,"A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult. Behind the lanky frame of a Gay Goth lies the power of a witch. Behind the mundane world of humdrum life there are ghosts, murders, and tales of illicit lust. In his first film, James Fessenden has woven classic chilling elements to create a terror tapestry of cold-hearted malice. Things are seldom what they seem, and there is no room for security in a world that only seems to be tranquil and quiet. As an independent film, it should be judged by its sinister spirit and not by the production values. This is a film that deserves to be watched on a cold autumn night when the wind rattles the house and creaking boards add to the atmosphere. See it with someone you want to freak out!",1155513600,5,826,4.37012987012987
2569776,5,B000FJTVC4,"""The Sacrifice"" was filmed on a very low budget in south-eastern New Hampshire.  There are no familiar actors in the film.  The natural settings are both appropriate and beautiful.  The indoor shots are plain and simple, as the plot requires them to be.

So what's so great about this film?

The writer/director, Jamie Fessenden, shows great talent for developing a plot step by step, often such that the viewer does not notice the significance of statements or actions during the first viewing.  This allows for a wonderful ""Aha! moment at the end and for the desire to watch the film several times over.

The actors live their parts so naturally it is as if they are not acting at all but just being themselves.  This contributes to a sense of understatement that effectively adds to the chilling reality of the drama as it unfolds.  The setting and theme remind me of the best of the stories of H. P. Lovecraft in which New England is perceived as a place with ancient roots entangled in an uncanny mixture of good and evil.  Things are seldom what they seem.  You don't have to live in New England to appreciate this or to identify with the characters, both major and minor, in the film.

The dialogue is well written, sometimes conveying information at several levels and often quite witty, even in the scariest scenes.  And there are scary scenes: Fessenden knows his genre well and has made a splendid first contribution to it.

Yes, the soundtrack is occasionally less clear than it might be, but excellent optional subtitles make up for that.  And the subtitles help one understand the very accurate use of medieval church Latin at certain terrifying highpoints in the film.

In addition, Fessenden wrote and arranged the musical score for the film, and the result is both very professional and very effective, often quietly beautiful.

Five stars for entertainment value and five stars for a first film well-done, so who cares about a less than perfect soundtrack and a few less than totally convincing night-time shots?  Go for it!

Disclaimer:  I play a silent mini-bit part in the film and am on screen for about five seconds - unrecognizably at that. I was in no way involved in the preparaton or production of the film, nor did I receive any compensation for my involvement, nor did I see the film until it was released on DVD.",1153440000,4,2342,4.721674876847291
