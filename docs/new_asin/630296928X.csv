529437,5,630296928X,"The River offers a riveting cinematic experience presented in Technicolor, which projected the strong colors of the environment around the one of many Indian rivers.  These strong colors reveal the symbolic contrast for the cultural differences between Western and Indian culture, which is an essential part of the film.  Selflessly, Jean Renoir directs this film, as he brings the audience on a cultural journey into the foreign traditions through the daily life of an English family and a young teenager.  Through the family, Renoir offers a visual presentation of the ethnic differences that stand out even more in relation to the British family who have adapted to the culture in which they coexist.  This is elevated through camerawork that provides a feeling of non-fiction, and a depiction of the truth.

In its presentation, the River does not seem like much, but it is here the magic rests.  Renoir uses a simplistic approach to the story that reveals the mundane of everyday life and how it would be to live in India.  Through this routine, the audience gets to see and hear how things are along the exotic and sacred river next to which they live.  The audience will learn about the origin to the people's beliefs, morals, and values that color the life for those who live along the river.  Harriet (Patricia Walters), a young teenage girl, provides thorough illustrations of the Indian society and culture, as she writes poetry and is on the verge of becoming a woman.

The story focuses on Harriet who also is the story's narrator, as she discloses this story from her youthful years growing up along a river in India.  Besides Harriet, the audience gets to meet her confident friend Valerie (Adrienne Corri) who is the only daughter of a rich family.  Together these two teens fall in love with Captain John (Thomas E. Breen), an American World War II veteran.  Harriet and Valerie begin to secretively compete for Captain John and Valerie decides to take no prisoners, as her approach brings the notion of Western attitude that expresses that everything is allowed in love and war.  Harriet on the other hand brings forth a mixed approach of both Western and Indian culture in her attempt to gain Captain John's attention through providing a detailed description of herself through the Hindu society in which she lives.

A third girl, Melanie (Radha) has recently finished school and returned home to find herself outside in a cultural and social predicament.  Melanie is the daughter of the Western man, Mr. John (Arthur Shields), and her late Hindu mother.  Her birth into two different cultures has left her in a social no man's land, as the Indian society's caste system leaves her without a caste and the Western society does not welcome her.  Even her father, Mr. John, thinks that it was cruel to bring her into the world.  Nonetheless, she also has feelings like the other girls, as it seems that she has feelings for Captain John.  However, she does not overtly express her feelings, as she continues to yearn for him at a distance.

Life and death are crucial portions of the culture where Harriet lives, as she narrates ""Kali the goddess of eternal destruction and creation - creation impossible without destruction.""  This suggests a cyclical existence where once something is created it will eventually be destroyed and once destroyed it will be created again.  Harriet's youngest sister Victoria even embraced this notion, as she pretends her rabbit Hoppity is a newborn--an idea that seems to go against Harriet's logic to which she points out that Hoppity was a new born last week too.  However, Victoria simply states, ""Babies can be born again and again, can't they?""

The river becomes an analogy for fundamental existential ideas of cyclical existence, as it continues to flow as it has done for millennia.  The river starts its flow in the Himalayas, as it is continuously replenished by new melted snow and it runs down to the Bay of Bengal.  The water returns to the hills and mountains in the north through monsoons to once again flow down streams to the Bay of Bengal.  Amidst the water of the river wildlife, fish and people coexist in life and death, which is brought to all by the water of the river.  This image is provided in the opening of the film, which offers an honest depiction of the culture in which the story takes place.

The River is a much smaller film compared to Renoir's previous accomplishments, but it does not lack artistic skillfulness and thoughtful design.  On the contrary, the River is much more personal as it slowly embeds itself in the cerebral cortex where it provides much contemplation for those who seek it.  Renoir does not seem to care whether the film has an exciting story or pleases hordes of moviegoers.  Instead he simply lets the characters seem to exist in an environment where the river destroys life and over again offers birth.  This film brings the audience a brilliant cinematic experience, which displays that Renoir truly is elevating his personal visual storytelling through his own visions.",1112400000,5,5083,4.8857808857808855
529438,5,630296928X,"The Amazon editor writes 'it was Renoir's first English-language film,' which is off-the mark by a decade. His first english language film is ""Swamp Water"" made in 1941, followed by six more films before ""The River.""

The River was actually the END of his English period.",1109721600,5,271,4.891304347826087
529439,5,630296928X,"Jean Renoir, after spending almost a decade in Hollywood struggling to establish an independent filmmaker staus, went to India. As it must have been for Renoir himself, THE RIVER is a breath of fresh air to its audience, which still holds a singular unique place in cinema.

Based on Rummer Godden's autobiographical novel on her childhood spend on the bank of the Gandhis River, the film explores a radically poetic narrative which depends neither on a plot, nor driven with strong characters. It is really a visual poem. It doesn't ""describe"" anything, in preference to capture (as well as to create) a certain atmosphere, in eccense a whole universe of a certain life, beeing ""felt"".

Though its aim was radical, and so were the mise-en-scene strategies taken by Renoir which were very unusual back then and even so today --especially the use of colors, that Renoir with his art director Eugene Lourie often walked around the sets and locations with cans of paint--, the film itself is very gentle, inviting the audience to share this idylic, magical, almost mystical universe of childhood.

The majority of the cast were non-actors, and the entire film was shot on location, including many shots taken in documentaristic situations showing the indeginious life surrounding the river.

At the same time, Renoir altered his location settings tremendously, both phisically (akmost re-painting everything) and cinematically (the two housese at the center of the story was actually one house that they rented). The story line itself often blends the ""real life"" aspects and the fantasy, not contrasting each other, or not even moving freely from one another; they just co-exist throughout the entire story.

And this approach is totally justified, for the ambition of the film is not to create a faithful representation of Indian life, nor to present a ""post-card"" exotic touristic vision through European eyes (as many runnaway production shot in foreign landscape does). If the film is faithfull to something, it is above all faithful to the childhood experience, how a child would have felt. Though the protagonist family is a British one, at least for the children India is not a ""foreign"" land: it is their home. And that is the atmosphere, the feeling of this entire film, of a childhood memory in which there were really no distinction between the reality and the imagination.

THE RIVER is a key film in Renoir's career moving from ""reality"" to ""inner truth"", from  the naturalism and social realism of his 30's films to the theatrical atrificially and satyrically enhanced realites that are presented in Criterion's DVD edition of ""STAGE AND SPECTACLE"". Because of this transitional nature, and the adventurous, experimental attitudes he was able to take thanks to the difficult production conditions, it may be a film in which he could be the truest to his feelings, to his aesthetics, to his sensitivities.

Making this film in such a remote location, or just financing this project considered to be odd in the view of the industry (after all, it vitually has no plot devices, and Jean's determination of not using stars), was extremely difficult. The producer that he found, Ken McEldowney (whose interview can be seen as one of the supplements), was not a film producer, but a successfull florist and real estate businessman. While shooting in Technicolor required a lot of electricity for lightings and such, it was nearly impossible to get enough supply of that in India back then. They had to bring their own generator, which in turn made a lot of noize, when Renoir liked to shoot with direct sound as much as possible. To create the camera movements which give the film an extraordinary floating feel was yet another difficulty the filmmakers had to face, for the film was shot in three-strips Technicolor process which offers thick, subtle, nuanced and beautiful color pallette, but in turn its camera was so huge and heavy.

But as you will see on this DVD, featuring a High-Def transfer from a magnificently restored film elements, the result that they achieved is...

...I won't say stunning, that doesn't sound appropreate for THE RIVER. The Technicolor process is often mistaken that it provides strong, lush colors that pop up to the ey, which is not true (it was just that the majority of Technicolor photographed films used sets, costumes and make-ups emphasising on primary colors). It's color is deep, more subtle, actually far more faithful to reality than the monopack processes (such as Eastmancolor). The effects of THE RIVER to its audience is gentle, absorbing, and beautifully poetic.

Watching THE RIVER is not to be captivated by a story, or strong outstanding characters, or what ever you might expect from a movie. It is to be absorved in a whole atmosphere and feel it, experience it, maybe dreaming it.

Martin Scorsese also offers a video introduction to the film. Obviously the film has influenced his works a great deal, especially the use of colors, of the rythm. Scorsese, especially in his recent films, also always try to capture an atmosphere, and not neccessary to ""tell the story"". He certainly wants to make a film like THE RIVER, and the closest achievement of his so far must be KUNDUN, which is also a visual poem which aim was really to recreate a whole atmosphere of Tibet.",1107129600,66,5330,4.989864864864865
529440,5,630296928X,"How wonderful are the rhythms, color, and imagery as they flow lyrically along - man, beast, spreading tree. They succeed one another like the film's central metaphor, the living continuum, the river of life. The lyricism, however, tends to flatten out the story's sparse drama in a way that requires some patience. In fact, these rhythms are the point -- life, death, renewal --  all beautifully photographed in great splashes of technicolor. To contemporary audiences, a film like this must seem an import from an alien world, and I suspect it was not  commercial  even on release -- who else in the US but an art house would show it!  The story is slender and idealized, set indelibly in India, and likely the author's fond reminiscence of  childood under the British protectorate. Except for the boy's muted passing, not much really happens. The only conflict involves three girls competing for a youngish war veteran, and it's a measure of Renoir's  approach that the competition never interferes with their friendship. Everyone, it seems, behaves with admirable restraint, even the dutiful servants, all of which serves to somewhat prettify the British presence. Nevertheless, this is one of those movies that creeps up on you. It's only afterwards, when the images have had a chance to linger and luminesce, that their sum total registers and you know you've seen something lasting. I, for one, am glad Renoir defied the rule and did not use pretty people; that would only have emphasized plot over theme, and individual over universal. Moreover, I wish more ordinary looking people appeared in movies, especially from Hollywood. Finding the unusual in the usual is the kind of thing I believe this movie was trying to bring out, while learning that lesson would do much to heal our celebrity-driven culture.  This is a Renoir classic and demonstrates once again, amidst a slam-bang world, what can be done on the plane of artistic understatement.",1066262400,5,1954,5.030959752321982

529503,3,630296928X,"I had never seen a film by Jean Renoir before. I saw this one because I like new experiences watching films. I had heard of this film that its cinematography was beautiful. That was true. And it is beautiful to see some of the Hindu traditions and rituals. Having filmed this in India, at the banks of the Ganges River, makes the movie a visual attraction.

Nevertheless, I was not much impressed by this film's story. I felt that the dialogue was synthetic most of the time. I am not so sure if this is owed to the fact that this is a French director ahead of an English-speaking language film. The director perhaps couldn't do much with the dialogue. I can remember a line in the party where the mother of the children holds her baby and says that she likes making a crown for the baby, and Captain John replies mechanically, most babies have socks, but few have crowns (paraphrased but it is pretty close). The party scene may be important to show how the girls are impressed by Captain John, and how awkward he may feel in the party, yet the scene is very static. It gives the impression that people didn't know what to say to each other. There are other moments during the movie where I felt that the social scenes lacked spontaneity, as if people were saying things mechanically. One of the clumsiest lines I heard came from John, the neighbor of the English family which is the center of this story. He tells his daughter Melanie, who struggles with her cultural identity because of her mixed English-Indian blood, that perhaps she shouldn't have been born at all. These words do not match his character, and although Melanie often feels that way, there could have been better ways to show it in the film. I thought that moment seemed too awkward and inconsistent with a father who has supported and encouraged her search for identity all along.

The film does flesh out important topics of cultural identity that can be understood in spite of the awkward dialogue. Even though I know that this is a post-WWII story, I am not so sure if this is after the British Empire abdicates its right to rule India. Regardless of this fact, I could see the impossibility of the mingling of these two different cultures, and that is why there are several moments where the English family and Melanie, who is half British and half Hindu, are out of place in this foreign country. The pivotal scenes have to do with Melanie's struggle with her own identity, the death of Harriet's brother (for trying to tame a cobra, imitating what he saw an Hindu do at the town without really knowing the science behind it), and Harriet's failed suicide as she tries to mingle with the Ganges River because of her feelings of guilt. Another theme that runs through this film is the intense admiration that the three girls in the film - Harriet, Melanie, and Valerie - feel toward Captain John. This admiration and Captain John's response to it also has cultural and psychological ramifications that bear on this story.

In sum, although the film is a beautiful one, I feel that it is somewhat awkward in developing its theme albeit an interesting one. This may not be the best film to start with Jean Renoir.",1420588800,3,3187,4.587719298245614

529505,5,630296928X,"This is the story of a few English families living on the banks of the Ganga in Bengal during the colonial era who are tasked by the British Raj to run the jute trade. This familiar setting invokes several cliches in our minds and Renoir sets about transcending each of them. To start with, the narrators father who supervises the jute trade is a gentle soul. He is not the typical penny pinching capitalist but someone who finds the never ending river of human beings carrying jute from farm to factory, fascinating. His interactions with locals both in and not in his employment show us how he believes in equality, respect and co-existence. The family takes after him and his house full of women has embraced a new culture with open arms without any fear of losing their own. The family celebrates Indian festivals, mingles freely with the locals and experiences the great spiritual seduction that India is.

The metaphor of the river as a symbol of the infiniteness of creation with its unending cycles of creation and destruction is exemplary. The family experiences the permanence of the river and contrasts the transitory nature of their existence with it. The pains and joys of life that are experienced uniquely by each one of the three women are so different and yet so similar! Some of us get a kiss on the lips, others a kiss on the forehead and others remain with unrequited desires and confused emotions. And yet, like the change of seasons we all bloom and flourish and we all perish in the end while the cycle of life goes on.

So what should we do given this human condition that weve been subjected to? Like all great artists, Renoir attempts to answer this most enigmatic and intriguing question. The River proposes Consent. It seems to whisper gently to our worried minds and torrid hearts to accept the ebb and tide of our existence, to not quarrel, to not revolt (What we think of as revolts are really tiny quarrels when you look at our insignificance and the enormousness of creation). The message here is to accept, to open our eyes and for the first time watch without resentment, to observe and learn from nature. As we follow natures course intently we might get bitten by a snake and die a swift death or a new insight will turn the course of our lives and push us in another unfamiliar direction.

Sitting on the banks, witnessing the course of the river and that of our existence, Renoir tells us that all is not lost. That this journey, however short or insignificant it might be, contains the potential to experience limitless joy and beauty - the innocence of children, the pleasure of creating new life, the camaraderie of good friendship and above all love for another person no matter how flawed or imperfect they are.",1403913600,,2755,4.6646090534979425

529508,5,630296928X,"After seeing Jean Renoir's ""The River"" for a second time, I find I agree with most of the reviewers here that it does indeed deserve to be ranked among Renoir's masterpieces. Visually, it is magnificent; Renoir and his nephew Claude create image after image that thrillingly evoke the paintings of their father and grandfather, Auguste Renoir. The screenplay, by Renoir and Rumer Godden, is a powerful, moving love letter to India, the titular river signifying the ever-renewing cycles of birth, love, and death. Renoir is a tourist in India, but the most enlightened kind of tourist, approaching the country, its customs and its people with love and respect.

On second viewing, I found the performances of Patricia Walters and Adrienne Corri easier to take; they are still obviously neophytes, but their gaucherie seems natural to the characters of two teenage girls still in the process of growing up. (Walters never made another film, but Corri had a long acting career, including ""A Clockwork Orange"" and a huge amount of British TV.) Unfortunately, Thomas E. Breen (Capt. John) and Radha (Melanie) still seem to be auditioning for Edward D. Wood, Jr. Renoir hired non-professional actors in a deliberate ploy to keep his budget down and avoid the meddling of studio bosses. Breen, an actual World War II amputee, and Radha, a superb Indian classical dancer, had the real-life credibility for their roles; they looked perfect, but the perfection was shattered every time they opened their mouths and their flat, wooden voices came out. (In Radha's case, her lack of acting talent was no hindrance to her future career; she became a leading theosophist and a close associate of Jiddu Krishnamurti.)

On the other hand, the subtle, meditative performances of Arthur Shields, Esmond Knight and Nora Swinburne deserve abundant praise. Other reviewers on this site have paid moving tribute to the courage and devotion of Knight and Swinburne, a real-life married couple. Knight lost one eye in his World War II service and was rendered almost totally blind in the other; Swinburne read his lines to him and helped him to move around the sets, so that he was able to continue acting, playing sighted characters, to the end of his long career. (As an old man, Knight appeared at the very beginning of Richard Lester's ""Robin and Marian,"" his empty eye socket for all the world to see.)

The inadequacy of some of the performances prevents ""The River"" from reaching the heights of ""Grand Illusion"" or ""The Rules of the Game.""

529511,2,630296928X,"First of all, I will admit that the cinematography of this movie is great. You watch it and simply get carried away by the beautiful colours, the great frames the directors chose as well as the great portrait shots of the actors. Nothing can be said to negate this fact; and if one actually watches the Criterion version of the movie, then all the better as they have done a magnificent work at remastering this film. I have some very very minor issues with it (that I will get to towards the end of this) but these are too minor to affect my overall opinion of the restoration work.
I am afraid that's where it ends with the positives. Despite the great cinematography, the film is an utter bore. Nearly half of the film is a documentary on India, where we get a female narrator (it is actually one of the characters of the movie) presenting us with life and the various local customs in India and keeping the plot in the background. It feels like the director forgot that he has to shot a story and started walking around India, shooting scenes of everyday life. Again, remember that the cinematography is great - but so is the cinematography in a BBC or a National Geographic documentary for that matter - this is a MOVIE!

Then, at some point after all this pointless wondering around, we get to the first interesting moment of the movie: the main male character is introduced. And our screens are getting filled up with this guy, who is supposed to carry the film forward. And the guy looks like anybody, acts like nobody and makes me wonder: ""is that the best they could come up with?"". The director (or the producer or whoever else was responsible) made a huge error in casting.

OK, so we don't have a great cast. Do we at least have a story? Hmmm, no. Nothing special there as well. Just ordinary people, doing whatever was ordinary for them to do back in that part of the world at that time, locals again doing the same thing. Dialog: flat, uninteresting. Characters: uninteresting. Drama (you know, that thing that theatre and movies are all about): in one or two scenes and that's it. Moral: India is an interesting place and there are some people living in it.

Of course, *when* the movie was made, it brought the culture of India on the silver screen. And lots of Europeans (and maybe Americans) got to see it and be exposed to it, which must have been interesting in its own right. But today, it is not the same. We live in a globalised world and most of the things this movie presents to us are common knowledge. This is why the documentary aspect of it diminishes its value today to such an extent.

Along with that of course, I think that the director simply got carried away with his love for India and there was probably no one around to moderate this (or he felt independent enough and he wouldn't listen).

This movie is perhaps seen as a masterpiece because it comes from a great director. However, I think that it is one of his weak pieces of work and pretty weak overall.

Proceed with caution, no cinema magic here.

PS: My only nag about the Criterion remaster is that occasionally the colour balance was fluctuating a bit on several sequences. You would see a bit more ""blue"" or ""green"" entering for a few frames and then back to the original colour balance. This is mentioned merely as an observation and NOT as a criticism. I can very well appreciate what Criterion has to do to achieve this quality and truly respect their achievement.",1285718400,6,3467,4.493650793650794

529560,5,630296928X,"This lovely film leaves you with a calm feeling, like the realization that life flows, like a river, bringing pain and loss and joy and love but that it all evens out in the end.  Perhaps it's the fact that the story, which seems to be drawn from the author's own life, is told from the distance of age.  This gives it a patina, a bittersweet soft glow that acknowledges the emotions of life in a muted way.  Maybe it's the fact that the author is English and she tells us of some painful events with typical English reserve.

Or maybe because Renoir was raised surrounded by beauty that he has the gift of bringing out the beauty of everyday human events.  Perhaps it's a stretch to compare his films in any way to his famous father's paintings but Scorsese does so I will too.  There is a roundness in painter Renoir's figures and an innate  affection and pleasantness in the scenes that carries over into this film. One has the feeling that the father loved his subjects and so does the son.  One is left feeling satisfied and pleased at the end.

And, the color and the visuals are those of an artist--no doubt about that!

The story is simple and, on the surface not a lot happens.  But it's like life....three girls on the brink of adolescence get a crush on a visiting American ex-soldier who has lost a leg in the war.  They quarrel and suffer their individual feelings in their pursuits of his attention, but as the wise mother says, it is for their own introduction to this phase of their lives.  And also, it's helpful to the fellow, too.  Her equanimity, as the girls sit and stew in their misery, exemplifies the spirit of the place. She also tells Harriet that the fact that she loves her husband makes the pain of childbirth a joy.  We see a Hindu festival where the clay Goddess is celebrated and then returned to the river to dissolve.  The events of the lives vary, from person to person, class to class, and race to race but they are all tied together by the still strong presence of the River, Life, which keeps on flowing.  And yet the film doesn't show just a grim acceptance of life's woes.  People are changed by their experiences.  Both Captain John and Radha come to accept their feelings of being outcasts.  That is the Western touch!

The film is odd by its very limitations.  Lack of money prevented Renoir from hiring professional actors for most of the parts and their very amateur-ness is at first jarring.  The fellow who plays Captain John, is really a terrible actor--he was chosen because he was a genuine amputee.  But he plays a man who feels out of place, anyway, so his awkwardness suits the character.  Then Radha, a classical Indian dancer, plays the mixed blood English/Indian girl.  She performs her dance very well but her acting leaves a lot to be desired and she doesn't seem to have anything English about her.  But again, her character feels alien, and after a while all of these characters mix up together in an unusual but nice soup.  It works.

Initially I was a little disappointed in the film but it leaves a nice afterglow so I give it five stars.  I liked the interviews with Renoir and Scorsese, too.

The lighting here is harsh, the camera work monotonous and static, evoking more a slide show than cinematography.  The closeups stop any drama dead on its tracks.

I was hoping to experience traditional Indian music and dance thru this movie and my wishes did come true.  This is a wonderful story from the perspective of a young girl growing up in India.  Her family is British and they are many children in that family, most of them girls.  What struck me was that story is semi-autobiographical by the writer Rumer Gunnar.  While naration and plot are really beautiful it is the extras and documentaries that prompted me to give this review 5 stars. I liked all documentaries available on this DVD, but most impressive one was personal story from the writer who created this work.  I was deeply touched with her painful personal history and my next step will be to read some of her books since I find her to belong to a class of writers like Marguerite Duras and Isaak Dinesen.  For anyone who wants to learn about the East from the westerner's point of view, this is the best choice to go about it.

529628,5,630296928X,"I watched everything on this DVD, and I am giving it a 5-star rating not for the film but rather for the British TV documentary that was included at the end.  Usually I don't watch the special segments on the making of a film, the cast, the location, etc., but in this case I found all this information much more interesting than the film itself.  I think I watched it all because after I watched the film, I was somewhat disappointed and wanted to know what exactly all the fuss was about.  The movie is very visually artistic and enjoyable to watch with that expectation only.  India was gorgeous and unsurprisingly director Renoir kind of made the story and setting into a non-stop stream of watercolors.  I don't think I have ever seen anyone else do it better than he did in this film.  However, as for the storyline I found its presentation too ""French"" for me.  What I mean by this is that I have often found the female characters in French films made by male French directors to be too adoring, too emotional or too wicked, if not all three at nearly the same time.  There often is this element of melodrama and sudden emotional swings as if all the females were PMS'ing at the same time.  FYI, I'm female by the way.  Even some of the male characters acted too melodramatically for me.  I have not read the novel by Rummer Godden or any of her books for that matter so I do not know if this was how the book was written or was due to free license taken by the director.  However, there was an hour-long British TV program about Godden's life and her return to India decades later included on this DVD.  It was excellent!  This DVD is worth watching just for that alone.  I was mesmerized listening to her tell her life story and watching her reactions as she revisited scenes of her childhood and young womanhood.  She has had an extraordinary life and she is so honest about herself, good and bad.  To me, she was the ""great work"" on this DVD and watching the film was the background special bonus material.",1166140800,8,2017,4.408108108108108

529631,4,630296928X,"In Jean Renoir's introduction to this film the great master cites Rumer Godden's book The River as the greatest work of literature about English colonialism in India. I can think of at least two books that are greater, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, and George Orwell's Burmese Days, two works of literature which seem to indicate that Britain's endeavors in India produced more harm than a few damaged human relations among the English.

Never the less, Jean Renoir brings unbelievable beauty to this film, which was his first attempt at full Technicolor, and it's a glorious attempt, called the most beautiful color film (along with Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes) by Martin Scorsese.

The color has a warm subtlety and grace which can only be described as characteristic as his father's paintings, cheap as that sounds.

Is The River the Rules of the Game of Renoir's color period, as Andre Bazin claims? No, I'm afraid no movie is as good as The Rules of the Game, yet this is a wonderful and important work all the same.",1137283200,11,1037,4.782122905027933
529632,5,630296928X,"On the surface, Jean Renoir's film ""The River"" is a docu-drama on India and its people, replete with temples, religious festivals and cultural practices, set amidst the backdrop of the Bengal River. Scratch the surface and ""The River"" becomes a metaphor on the meaning of life, or at least the Hindu concept of it -- a cycle of births and deaths.

Several scenes allude to this theme. For instance, the statue of Hindu goddess Kali, symbolising creation and destruction, is moulded from the river's clay and returns to clay when it is submerged in the river after devotees complete a ritual celebration. Mr. John (Arthur Shields) at one point philosophises on life with his American cousin, Capt. John (Thomas E. Breen), stating one man jumps from the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge while another goes on his way across the bridge. When young Bogey (Richard Foster), Harriet's brother, dies from a cobra's bite a sibling is born some months after his death.

Between birth and death are the lives of ordinary people who reside, work, play or worship along the river. Some face conflict which is either solved or insoluble. Capt. John is the war veteran (unspecified war) who has lost a leg and is struggling to put his past behind him. Valerie, Melanie and Harriet (Adrienne Court, Radha and Patricia Walters) are adolescent girls who express their respective infatuations for Capt. John and their ensuing growing pains. Mr. John is the British expatriate and widower who has contentedly adopted the ways and culture of India, yet agonises over the mixed-race status his marriage to an Indian woman has created for his daughter Melanie. Harriet's father  (Esmond Knight) is the manager of a jute factory, busy with its operation, yet concerned about his children growing up. Boats laden with jute ply the river bringing Indian labourers, pursuing their livelihood. And holy men spend their days mediating at the banks of the river. The point is, each represents an extension of how humanity as a whole goes about living between birth and death.

As for the photography, ""The River"" is nothing short of spectacular. Interestingly, it was the first Technicolor film shot in India, which apparently posed some inherent technical limitations that Renoir had to overcome while filming in the tropics, which makes it all the more magnificient. The result is an impressionist's dream. Renoir does a Renoir in setting up shots that could have been stills from his father's own paintings. Look for the twin girls sleeping, the nanny and children peering through a colonnade lined railing, the teenage girls sneaking a view of Capt. John's arrival from a crumbling brick fence. There are so many lovely images, actually far too many to mention in this review.

Some reviewers have commented about the weak performances of the actors. While this is a fair assessment, Renoir had little choice. Had he compromised artistic preference and authenticity for the stereotypical India the studio heads in Hollywood wanted, perhaps the funding for more notable actors of the day could have been cast. When producer Kenneth McEldowney, a newcomer to the film industry, consented to Renoir's concept for ""The River"" funding was limited to no more than a handful of well-known actors. Although he cast amateurs like Breen (an actual amputee) and Radha (a classical Indian dancer), it is arguable their personal backgrounds made their roles more realistic and believable.

All in all, ""The River: Criterion Collection"" is EXCELLENT. In addition to this beautiful 90-minute movie, there's a commentary from Martin Scorsese -- a key figure in the restoration of the film, an interview with Jean Renoir, a conversation with Rumer Godden, the author of ""The River"", as well as the original theatrical trailer and some off screen stills taken during the filming. A booklet comes with this collection too, featuring essays from notable film scholars (Ian Christie and Alexander Sesonske) and technical insight on the restoration of the film.",1128556800,36,4014,5.111280487804878
529633,2,630296928X,"I thought, since this was a Criterion Collection flick, that it was gonna be a psychedelic, spaced-out trip through India with heavy Ravi Shankar music, incense, and flower children with bells and long hair trying to ""find themselves"". It was about as far away from that as anyone could get, but it was WEIRD nonetheless. Basically, it's the story of a bunch of rich white people living in India on some sort of plantation, far from the everyday realities of India itself in their luxurious palace. When I found out the plot I was immediately turned off, because I hate movies about rich white people, especially when they slum around in foreign countries ripping off the local economy through some sort of corporate pseudo-slave labor arrangement, sitting back on their plantations acting all sophisticated in white linen clothing.

So anyway, the movie centers on this one white chick, Harriet, and SHE IS UGLY. Good grief, can she peel the paint off a wall. Anyhow, she's living on this plantation with her ritzy family and her one very bizarre younger brother who likes to play with his lizard or something. All of a sudden, some rich white heart-throb guy named Captain John shows up and suddenly Harriet GETS IT, her first crush, and she discovers something besides bad poetry and horses. She first visits him while he is at her neighbor's house, which strikes me as a weird sort of sexual harem because the neighbor's wife died and ever since then the neighbor apparently has the hots for a pre-pubescent Indian girl. (Ah, the elegance of foreign lands, where there are no child exploitation laws.)

Anyway, Captain John is an American, a sleazy bohemian type that looks like a cross between Harry Chapin and Eraserhead. He smokes cigarettes in a very sexual manner while galavanting around town in Tommy Bahama clothing. Harriet invites him to a party at their ritzy family house (called ""the big house"", go figure) and after she flirts with him non-stop, he decides to go for Harriet's SISTER, Valerie, who looks like an impish Meryl Streep with a bad nose job. So, jilted by Captain John for her own sister, Harriet decides to stalk him all over the stereotypical ""Indian Village"" where we see all sorts of truly Indian things like cobra-charming and a marketplace where you can buy tapestries made by children enslaved in sweatshops all over India. What I noticed at this point is that Captain John looks about 30, and Harriet's like 15, but even though he's fascinated with her in a quasi-sexual way, he plays hard-to-get. In a sad development, Harriet says ""I have decided to conquer him"", and attempts to seduce him by reading her bad poetry, which seems to amuse him, like, ""wow, I've got a 15 year-old rich white chick who thinks I'm the man"". But the best part is that Valerie, who we've come to totally despise for being the Ego Princess From Hell, steals Harriet's diary and reads it aloud to Captain John (which, of course contains bad love poetry about him). So the two sisters get in an ALL OUT BRAWL right in front of this guy, and he intervenes to cop a feel with both of them while ""breaking it up"". Harriet then storms off, which causes Captain John to think Valerie is a bitch for reading the diary. So Valerie then ""plays"" with him by throwing a toy at him, which causes him to tear his hamstring, and he limps off in a hilarious scene, vowing never to hang out with her again.

At this point, the movie turns really, really STRANGE. Suffice to say a THIRD girl gets involved, and good ol' Captain John starts spreading himself a little too thin, keeping 3 juvenile girls hanging as he tries to figure out which one to pop first. However, tragedy strikes as Valerie & Harriet's brother (the one with the lizard fetish) gets a little too close to a pet cobra. The sad outcome gives everyone a big wake-up-call, and everyone gets real moody. The final outcome is an anti-climactic scene where Harriet resumes her poetry-writing in a funk about failing to seduce a 30-year-old.

This flick wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the archaic screenplay, atrocious acting (even for 1950), and dull character development. I mean, it tries hard to be really ""Indian"", but it's about as Indian as a trip to The Bombay Company or Pier 1. Most annoyingly, the movie itself would be no more than a half-hour in length if it weren't padded with very bizarre National Geographic-style narrations about Indian culture, complete with some British voice-over chick that makes it seem like a 3rd grade social studies filmstrip. (At times I was waiting for the little ""beep"" to indicate where I needed to advance the frame.) The footage of India is swell, in its weird early-Technicolor restored glory, but after you get over that, the whole package strikes me as really contrived. I think of all the truly wonderful films that could stand the Criterion treatment and it makes me wonder how they arrive at the decision to bother with crap like this.",1127174400,32,4957,4.727167630057804

529635,4,630296928X,"This is not quite the rediscovered masterpiece some have asserted, but there are pleasures to be had with the river-as-life metaphor, which frames and drives master filmmaker Jean Renoir's 1951 film about the waning years of British colonial life in India. As experienced by Harriet, a young, impressionable British girl, the story is essentially one long flashback whose unseen narrator is really the grown-up version of Harriet. Based on a novel by Rumer Godden, her nostalgic descriptions of her early childhood in Bengal conjure up the images presented here of a time long past, when her family lived along a tributary river bank of the sacred Ganges.

There is little in the way of a plot as the movie drifts at a leisurely pace from one episode to the next with the insertion of National Geographic-style documentary scenes, in particular, focusing on the traditional Diwali festival of lights and ceremonies praising the  goddess Kali. The main storyline involves Captain John, a dashing American war veteran who has lost his leg and a sense of purpose, as he shows up and becomes the center of attention for not only Harriet but her flighty friend Valerie and a half-caste friend named Melanie. Along the way, Harriet creates a Hindu-based story to get the captain's attention away from the alluring Valerie, Melanie is on a search for her own identity, and Harriet's mischievous brother becomes drawn to a deadly cobra in the woods. It's fair to say that the plot strands sort themselves out in predictable fashion with death followed by birth to emphasize the continuity of the river that sustains them and the villagers. With the exception of a few British veterans like Nora Swinburne as the mother, the cast is comprised mostly of children and amateurs (including an affecting Patricia Walters as Harriet), which further feeds into the documentary feel of the film. Thomas E. Breen, a real-life amputee, plays Captain John admirably after appearing in only minor roles in a couple of Hollywood movies. Neither Walters nor Breen made another film after this one. Fortunately the lack of experienced actors does not detract from the film's innate exoticism, brightly-hued scenery, and authentic regional music, which provide the idyllic setting for Renoir's exploration of the fragility of human existence. Renoir's nephew Claude produced the luminous Technicolor cinematography, which is captured well though not exceptionally in the Criterion DVD package.

Extras with the Criterion package include a 13-minute 2004 interview with Martin Scorsese, who was instrumental in pushing forward the restoration effort. As a champion for film restoration, Scorsese talks about the film's impact on him as a child and explores in some detail the techniques Renoir deployed in his quest for authenticity. Renoir himself is captured in a brief video introduction for the film, as he discusses the circumstances which brought him together with florist-turned-fledgling producer Ken McEldowney to make the movie. An intriguing, uncompromising man, McEldowney himself is interviewed in just audio format as he discusses his mission to make the movie against seemingly insurmountable odds. The best feature of the package, however, is the hour-long documentary, ""Rumer Godden: An Indian Affair"", produced in 1995, which traces in visually stunning detail the life of the novelist as she returns to the India of her childhood and revisits remembered sites and memories long past.",1113696000,5,3476,5.282097649186257

7833293,4,630296928X,"The River was Jean Renoirs first film made after his wartime experience in Hollywood. Shot in color on location in India, the movie is about the growing pains of three young women set against the constancy of a holy river around which their daily lives unfold. Fourteen-year-old Harriet (Patricia Walters) is the plain sister determined to transform from ugly duckling to swan.  Harriet, as an adult, narrates. Her older neighbor Valerie (Adrienne Corri) is the attractive redhead who impetuously stirs up jealousy after the arrival of Capt. John (Thomas E. Breen), a handsome soldier. Melanie (Radha) is an exotic beauty whose mixed heritage makes her feel like an outsider

The film portrays the culture clash of a disabled American war veteran and a British community in the last days of the Raj. Essentially a series of reminiscences of a young woman coming of age in an exotic land, The River features beautiful photography by Renoirs nephew, Claude. We see an English family living quietly in a picturesque land.

Renoir fell in love with India during a pre-production trip to the country. Having left Hollywood because of the intrusive, heavy-handedness of studio boss Darryl Zanuck, Renoir decided to go it on his own and hired newcomers and amateurs in key roles, a practice Hollywood never would have allowed.

The River is eloquent in its visual imagery and depiction of an interesting period in India's history. Its a mid-20th century look at India without the timeworn cliches of Hollywood. However, without recognizable actors and a traditional plot, the movie doesn't connect as effectively as it should. A film needs more than picture postcard images and a director's passion for a location to be successful. This picture fails to draw the viewer in. As a result, it can be admired as a work of art, if not as a great dramatic showcase for its actors. It's also very slow moving.

 Bonus features on this high-definition Blu-ray restoration include an archival introduction by Jean Renoir; Around the River, a 60-minute documentary about the making of the film; 2004 interview with Martin Scorsese; rare behind-the-scenes still photos; critical essay; and original production notes by Renoir.",1429142400,,2208,5.1194444444444445
