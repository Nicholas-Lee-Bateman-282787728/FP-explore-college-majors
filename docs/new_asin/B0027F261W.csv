However, I ended up liking all of the characters,but loving Nanhee(the main girl) and relating to her the most. She's a struggling, somewhat immature, writer who's career hasn't really popped off yet, still living with her mom and trying to find her way with love after turning 30. She has a cute, up and comming baseball player boyfriend who adores her yet she has feelings for her very handsome, succesful, long time friend (Jeong Jin Lees' character). He still has lingering feelings for a pretty musician who left him years before and went on to become famous after a tragic accident happened with one of their mutual friends from college. Things become more complicated when Nanhee moves out of her nagging/disapproving  moms house and into a apartment with Jeongs character while also dealing with judgement she recieves from other people for dating her baseball player who's 8 yrs younger than her. A younger, more succesful writer who works with Nanhee starts hitting on her boyfriend while Nanhees' friend/roomate starts dating a sweetheart who works with him, then realizes he loves Nanhee...until his ex-girlfriend rolls back in town for a concert that he's involved with(He's a marketer or something like that). Great storyline with Romance,laughter and Hot Asian male eye candy! What else do you need?!",1360022400,,1391,5.021645021645021

If you haven't seen this one and you enjoy romantic comedys then I would say give this a try!",1359763200,,356,4.028169014084507
8354640,5,B0027F261W,"I love this drama. It is hilarious and a great love story. The drama uses baseball lingo to get the story across, and it does. The female lead (Soo Ae)plays a struggling writer I can identify with. She has a good heart and a strong, persistent personality. The male lead (Lee Jung-jin) is easy on the eyes. Ladies, you will love him. Ranks in my top ten K-dramas.",1352332800,,363,4.352941176470588
8354641,5,B0027F261W,"As a newcomer to the KDrama genre, this is one of the first that I watched.  This is an adorable and somewhat realistic romantic comedy story about a girl reaching 30 and realizing that she has to grow up and accomplish something.

This is a pretty low key drama, with a few funny exceptions.  The stalker teen of the boyfriend makes you so mad!  But this story flows very easily and with a realistic take on relationships with an age difference.

There is also a fantastic exploration of friendship, and the intimacy that can spring from living in close quarters.  I would recommend this Kdrama to anyone that enjoys romantic comedies!",1332806400,,636,4.684684684684685
8354642,5,B0027F261W,"This is pretty good drama, its funny, the actors have good chemistry and Soo Ae gives a pretty goood performance. Her character Nan Hee is reaching her 30s and her life has gone no where and it kinda makes you think. Well I recomend this drama if you want to have a laugh or just want a good story.",1276214400,4,298,4.067796610169491
