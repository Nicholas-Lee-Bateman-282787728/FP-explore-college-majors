8046725,2,B0007CIM2O,"I bought this DVD, as I saw the Photo of Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on it  But to my Surprise the picture and sound quality were bad ( the Picture was Cloudy, and I hardly could Hear What they were saying. I Ask Amazon for Refund, and after going through many communication I received my Refund. I do not Recommend it.",1395100800,,319,4.145161290322581
8046726,3,B0007CIM2O,"Video quality on these five b&w episodes is acceptable. Only show #5 has deep contrast, but the others are watchable. Sound is a different matter. Episodes 2 and 4 have terribly murky audio as if from a misaligned tape head. All here run a full 59 minutes.

The manufacturer's logo infrequently appears at lower right of screen. Extras: Text screen bios. Four chapters per program. No subtitles. (List on outer cover and storage box have shows 2 and 3 out of playing order.
