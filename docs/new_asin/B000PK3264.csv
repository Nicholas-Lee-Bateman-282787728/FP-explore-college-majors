It is awesome on a big screen TV around 42""",1378944000,2,281,4.431372549019608

2824153,5,B000PK3264,"Isis Visuals has many aquarium themed dvds to choose from, and the reason I bought this one was because of the variety of different scenes I could select to watch based on my mood.  There's a film with natural coral as a background for the colorful fish that swim by, another with discus fish set to the sound of bubbles, and even a shark tank!  There's also North Waves, Warm Waters, Deep Sea and Tropical tanks to choose from as well.  Some are set to the sound of waves, some to bubbles and a few with music.  It's a lot of variety for the price - it's on sale right now - buy it!!",1299110400,,584,4.0964912280701755
8191958,3,B000PK3264,I haven't watched this in a while.  Its pleasant enough but eventually you recognize movement patterns and tire of the scenery.  There are a few options but the same applies.,1525824000,,174,4.766666666666667
8191959,5,B000PK3264,Lots of fun.  It's like having an aquarium without the expense and upkeep.,1421971200,,74,4.6923076923076925
8191960,4,B000PK3264,This is a beautiful DVD and very soothing to have on.  I'm not too sure if it is filmed in HD even though it says so.  It is still very clear but I think it could be a little clearer yet.,1420588800,,187,3.5365853658536586
8191961,5,B000PK3264,"I work with a person with intellectual disability, this helps her to soothe herself. It is an excellent tool for her caretaker.",1420070400,,127,4.818181818181818
8191962,4,B000PK3264,"Pretty good. Bought this to provide some soothing background for my Daddy who was very ill. My parents kept the TV on all the time but he would complain that mother watched the news all the time. This was just the thing. Although I also bought a fireplace DVD that we used a lot more often this made for a nice change. When we moved Daddy to hospice this went with us. By the time we left most of the staff had ordered this for themselves. They all loved it.

Visuals are realistic. Music is very soothing. It has a continuous loop mode will repeat either a single selection or cycle through all the different scenes before starting over. It has a little hiccup when the complete loop ends but otherwise the scene transitions are smooth. Would be great for kids/babies room or a nice ambient background anywhere.",1418169600,,812,4.486486486486487
8191963,5,B000PK3264,I am very pleased.  This DVD is very soothing.  I will be buying more in the future.,1408579200,,84,3.8823529411764706

8191965,5,B000PK3264,I bought the DVD for a cancer treatment center I work at. The patients love the music and tanks. The first day I showed it I heard so many great comments and they were very appreciative. Nice music and clear looking tanks,1401580800,2,221,4.285714285714286
8191966,5,B000PK3264,"I bought this for my son who has mild (high functioning) autism, ADHD, and anxiety.  He has a difficult time winding down at night and getting to sleep at a reasonable time.  I was looking for the electric plug in fish tanks with the idea of it calming him down.  I came across this CD, and thought this would be even better.  I was right.  He loves the different tank screens, and to be able to choose different sounds, such as waves, bubbles, or soft music.  Most of the time, he is sleeping within 20 minutes.  We are so happy we found this product!",1397347200,3,552,4.25
