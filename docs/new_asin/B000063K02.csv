1690217,1,B000063K02,"I thought I was getting a DVD of a movie called ""Exposure,"" about a photographer as portrayed by Peter Coyote.  I thought the Coyote movie was excellent and really enjoyable, with great acting in some of the secondary roles.  This DVD of a more recent movie named ""Exposure"" stars Ron Silver as a photographer.  I thought this version was terrible and would not recommend it to anyone.  The actors did a decent job, but plot was dull and predictable.  A One Star rating is too high in my opinion.",1028937600,20,496,4.52808988764045
1690218,4,B000063K02,"Update:  This film is NOT the Peter Coyote film, reviewed as follows.
Peter Coyote plays an ex-pat photographer, roaming the streets of Brazil. The opening scenes show not only his fascination with street life, but also some flashes of unclad prostitutes as his models, one of whom ends up dead. He becomes a suspect while he tracks the real killer through a Fellini-esque landscape, and still finds time to interact with his European girl friend.
This was mildly titillating - memorable mostly for the street scenes and attractive hookers who keep getting bumped off, and some interesting knife fights. Shot on location with some Portuguese dialect (!), this well-made film, with a thin but interesting plot and somewhat predictable storyline, is pleasing to the eye. I'd rather watch this than TV on a bored night at home.
The Coyote film if great...just be sure which one you're buying.",1014854400,10,889,5.006756756756757
