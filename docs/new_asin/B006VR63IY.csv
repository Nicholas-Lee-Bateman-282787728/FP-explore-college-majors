8505065,2,B006VR63IY,"This series tries to weave together series of events that claim to connect things together.  These rediculous episodes are a disappointing platform to show off the writer's creativity a-la ""Mr. Peabody's Improbable History Lesson"".

From the cover art (and having just seen ""How It's Made"" for the first time) I was expecting something that shows the inner-workings of a technology, which it does not.

I would suggest if someone wants to see technology associated with the everyday stuff around us, the watch ""How It's Made"" instead.  Maybe someday someone will produce a series that really does show us how stuff works.",1361318400,,621,5.118811881188119
