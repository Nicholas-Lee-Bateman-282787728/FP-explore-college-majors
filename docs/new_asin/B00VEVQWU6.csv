7087851,5,B00VEVQWU6,"Another great episode. This episode narrates the growth of the Gospel in China. There are an estimated  60-80 million believers in China and growing but the mission field is huge since there are about 1.3 billion people in China. Keesee is a master story teller and starts this episode following the steps of Hudson Taylor who said that if he had a thousand lives he would give it to China, no he said, to Christ. A few things I learned, besides the great need of the Gospel in China, 1. American evangelicalism has brought a lot of confusion to China. 2. There aren't super star believers. All believers share Christ with those they meet. 3. The Gospel is for all, even those that China considers outcasts with disabilities. The Lord is building his church in China but we need to pray for more laborers. Those of us who live in America have it too easy. It is time to open our eyes to the huge mission field we have not only here in America but in the world.",1429747200,4,960,4.393258426966292
