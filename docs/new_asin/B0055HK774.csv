8458342,5,B0055HK774,"I'm an intermediate guitarist, interested in learning B.B. King style guitar.  I found Max Milligan's teaching technique to be very easy to follow.  He has a kind and gentle manner, and with the camera close ups of both hands, makes it easy to imitate this unique guitar styling.  You feel like you're sitting in the room with this teacher, having a private lesson.  I'll be buying more of this teacher's DVDs, after I master this lesson.",1333497600,,438,4.723684210526316
8458343,5,B0055HK774,"Max Milligan has a relaxed and confident way of playing, much like BB King himself. All of the phrasing, the use of choke bends and vibrato that is BB King's trademark style of play are laid out in an easy to follow format. Definitely would recommend this to anyone aspiring to learn BB's unique way of playing blues.",1333497600,,317,4.482758620689655

The first 2 chapters will put you to sleep, thank goodness for fast forwarding, and later it looks like maybe we get to something interesting.  Sorry, explanations are not particularly informative and no on screen tab or any indication of where one might find them.  There is a video out there with B.B. demoing his style which is far more informative not to mention the man himself.",1320796800,,498,4.561797752808989
