7990171,1,B0000996F8,"Review of Miracle Pictures disc. Talk about being made on a shoestring, this movie must have used only half a shoestring. The cast has some good performers but they`re stuck with a terrible script and laughable sets. You can have fun smiling at miniaturized sets and inept dialog. Picture is just fair and sound is good. A curio from the past.",1200528000,8,343,4.639344262295082
