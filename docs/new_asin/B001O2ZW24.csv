8329095,1,B001O2ZW24,Absolutely love lexx used to watch it on arena a long time ago when i found out a box set was being released especially with this cool tin i jumped at the chance to buy it. After watching it i was greatly disappointed 1st off the picture quality is terrible it looks like a VHS with blurry washed out colors and grain galore i'm pretty sure they just ripped it off a vhs and didn't even bother to re-code! Next the sound is just as worse it's not in 5.1 and you have to turn your sound system up to nearly max just to hear it! And th throw salt in the wound these are also the censored versions I know this because the shower scene in episode 2 is censored. And the actual tin is also dodgy at best it's just flimsy aluminum if you drop it it'll dent very easily and also the latch to open it is held in place by a magnet glued to the tin mine broke off very early. The discs are just in crappy cardboard sleeves shoved inside a plastic holder inside the tin too it's definitely NOT worth the price their asking for this! If your thinking of buying this than DON'T go get the NTSC versions separately their way better PQ and UNCUT. I'll be doing just that.,1315008000,3,1156,4.096916299559472
8329096,5,B001O2ZW24,"Purchased this item before they started telling people it was PAL ONLY!
Got in touch with PayPal and my monies were refunded and wasn't required to send the DVDs back! Since then, found the AVLogic V0-360KHD at around $49 that Converts PAL to NTSC and NTSC to PAL. Plays these DVDs perfectly through our North American systems. Offered to re-emburse the Vendor the refunded monies; but no reply back, so now I've got the Complete Series that I can play, plus any other PAL DVD that you can't find a Region 1 copy.",1271635200,,513,4.526881720430108
8329097,5,B001O2ZW24,"Wanted this series for a long time, always the last place you look! Next time I look on Amazon.com first!",1266278400,,105,4.3
8329098,5,B001O2ZW24,"What do you get if you mix FARSCAPE with THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and a smidge of RED DWARF?

LEXX, baby. LEXX.

If you like any or all of those others, this wacky, unique scifi comedy adventure (sometimes Musical) series is ABSOLUTELY up your street.",1262822400,,263,4.574468085106383
8329099,4,B001O2ZW24,"This series is completely off the wall comedy and funny to boot, albeit on the dark side with gratuitious killing and resurrections.
Be sure to check if your DVD player can handle PAL disks. The standard in the Canada and the US is NTSC and if you check on the sellers site it is clearly PAL.
Often the less expensive players from Wallmt and others can play bothe PAL and NTSC but not the higher quality ones. It isn't intuitive but it is true.
Enjoy.",1254614400,8,451,4.317647058823529
