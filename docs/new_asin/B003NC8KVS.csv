8400829,5,B003NC8KVS,"I started listening to ""The Strangest Secret"" when I was just a teenager back in the early 1970's.

I was lucky to have had many inspirations in my young life, and, this recording was one of them.

In the early 1970's you could still catch some of Earl Nightengale's programs on some radio stations.  He has been an inspiration to more than a few generations of Americans.

Earl Nightengale wrote this recording from many sources.  He took wisdom that has been handed down to us from the ancient Greeks, and, re-worked it into modern American English with examples that illuminate its relevance to the everyday lives of everyone.

In addition to drawing his inspiration for this recording from Aristotle and Plato, Mr. Nightengale also included many concepts from an obscure American philosopher by the name of ""James Allen.""

The work ""As a Man Thinketh"", by James Allen, is closely related to this recording, and, Mr. Nightengale appropriately bestowed on us yet another inspiration in his recording about the book.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/As-a-Man-Thinketh/dp/1442118911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">As a Man Thinketh</a>.

What is the Strangest Secret?  I don't want to spoil it for you.  It has to do with the realization that life is not about finding yourself - life is about creating yourself.

This recording, which I have listened to thousands of times, provides an outline for taking control over the most powerful instrument in our lives - our own consciousness.  Mr. Nightengale compares our consciousness to a powerful earth-moving machine with a little man sitting on top of it.  We can either use it to build and create, or, through neglect, ""let it run itself into a ditch.""

You will find corollary works that supplement this wonderful recording, and, I invite you to include them in your quest for enlightenment.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-Is-Within-You/dp/1561700231/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power Is Within You</a>

Trivia:  Earl Nightengale's recording of ""The Strangest Secret"" is the largest selling non-musical recording in history.  (Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" is the largest selling musical recording in history).",1342310400,2,2258,5.7734138972809665
