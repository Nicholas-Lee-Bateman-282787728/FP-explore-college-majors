6779887,5,B00OZOIKOU,"""Guess How Much I Love You: Someone Special"" is another great DVD release from this wonderful series based on the books by Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram. It features seven stories from the show, all of which are available with English subtitles, an option that unfortunately is often not included on releases like these.

The simple charm of this series, which airs on Disney Junior in the United States, is that it doesn't seem to be specifically trying to teach anything, but somehow ends up doing so anyway. There are lessons here to be found about appreciation of nature, the joys of friendship and the value of a relationship between a father and his son, but all of them are presented in gentle, comfortable format set against an absolutely gorgeous backdrop of scenery that pleases the eye from beginning to end. Little Nutbrown Hare is accompanied by a variety of well-characterized friends that include his best friend Little Field Mouse, Little Redwood Fox, Little Grey Squirrel, Little White Owl, Blue Bird and Otter.

The seven stories are:

- ""Moon Dance""
- ""Can You Touch the Stars?""
- ""Field of Flowers""
- ""Treasure Hunt""
- ""Wind Whistle""
- ""Lucky Stick""
- ""Shadowplay""

Although, given that this is a DVD, the stories are not presented in HD, the look of the show is still excellent. Bright and vibrant, nice quality, and the lack would be really hard to tell unless you were watching very closely.",1422057600,4,1414,4.806584362139918

8685885,5,B00OZOIKOU,"This is the most adorable show. It always has a good message of friendship and love. It is set in the woodlands and the scenery is made of watercolor and is absolutely beautiful. The characters are beautifully drawn and colored as well. I am always amazed over the wonderful richness of the colors and details of the illustrations.

The theme song is beautiful. The voices of the characters are mostly realistic (except the mouse), but every one of them has a cute voice. This is not one of those annoying shows that you'll wish your children would not watch. It is a great show and even I enjoy watching it. The characters speak slowly and clearly and it helped my daughter learn a lot of vocabulary when she learned to talk. She is now three-years-old and still loves this show as much as she always has. I've never known a children's cartoon better than this one. Much better than the rest of the junk that's on TV.

This particular DVD contains the following episodes:
1. Moon Dance
2. Can You Touch the Stars
3. Field of Flowers
4. Treasure Hunt
5. Wind Whistle
6. Lucky Stick
7. Shadow Play

 It runs 80 minutes long in total.",1455321600,,1132,4.480582524271845
