I thought this a very good animation.
And I have to read the original comics.
Buy at Amazon collecting comics, reading everything from felt
""The original is much better,"" is to say.
The animated version is good, better comic.

We recommend that you see before the animation version of the comic version.
Then please read the comic version.

Comic version is a really good story.

3522488,4,B001D2650I,"Regarding the drawing it's quite nice to see. As for the story, it first looked quite surprising to me, but it turned out to be very funny! I particularly enjoyed ep. 2, seeing this ex-boy trying to adapt to his (her) new condition, or rather his family and friends trying to adapt to him/her! At the beginning he kept acting like a boy, leading to some funny situations as you can expect ^^. But, with the help of his ""girlfriends"", he/she learns quickly how to behave properly (indeed he/she was rather effeminate before and this new situation doesn't seem to bother him/her that much). And this leads to the second comical aspect, where he/she behaves like a girl even more than his/her friends themselves (to their despair! looks like they have a new serious competitor! ^^). So this gender UFO ends up causing some trouble to both side, and I had lots of fun seeing them entangled in awkward situations. But then the end of the series is a little repetitive and kitsch.  Still, I had a good time, I recommend it !",1251158400,2,1018,4.562841530054645

Kashimashi: 6.5/10

In the end, I got pretty much what I expected - a silly, simplistic series, complete with lesbians in school girl uniforms. It didn't amaze me, yet I didn't hate it.

Kashimashi is about a boy, Hazumu, who gets transformed into a girl in a very realistic manner. Once he's a girl(!?), he/she/it finds himself in a yuri love triangle with his tomboy childhood friend, Tomari, and the pretty girl, Yasuna, he was chasing after back when he only had two sexual openings (excluding his ears and nose, of course).

It could've been better if the reasoning behind certain aspects of the plot weren't quite so retarded. For example:

#1: Instead of having a spaceship crash into a boy and change his gender...somehow, why not throw in some extra originality and have him fall into some gender changing water? It still would've been daft but nowhere near as 'out there' as having a spaceship crash into a random person and remove his penis...somehow. It seemed to have been done just so some weird alien girl could exist and add ""-puu"" to the end of every sentence. Don't you just hate those characters whose only quirk is to add a meaningless suffix to the end of everything? It almost makes me believe it was a desperate attempt by the creator of the story to be original; creating a never used before suffix.

#2: Instead of avoiding doing something as terrible as adding depth by making Yasuna's fear of males realistic and giving her a sexual abuse back-story, why did they give her a stupid eye problem where she simply couldn't see males? 'Just go to bloody Specsavers!' came to the front of my mind. They even made the cure for her problem love - like waking sleeping beauty from her sleep with a kiss, which hasn't been repeated many times in various forms. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

There were a lot of things like the above that could've been changed for the better. Whoever came up with/copied the gender swapping story got a lot of the simple things wrong in what was an overly simple story. I should be asked to proof read all manga/anime stories in order to avoid blatant stupidity...

In terms of the love triangle, my biggest issue lies with which way Hazumu went when he decided which girl he wanted. Why, oh why, did he pick a plain pretty girl type instead of his childhood 'prince'? It made no sense whatsoever. *name removed* had always been there for him, where as *named removed 2* had turned Hazumu down before. Now, if I was picking my other half and they both looked hot, I'd go with the one who'd never betray me - that's just logical. But, of course, Hazumu thought differently. The only upside to Hazumu's 'final' choice was that the girl he turned down and himself spent most of the last episode hanging out, saying goodbye to each other in their own way.

Sadly, the love triangle mess only worsened after the finale of the TV series. In the OVA, the girl Hazumu picked decided she'd had enough of him/her after four months of him helping her, informing him she could stand on her own two feet and wanted to be alone. Basically, she made the entire TV series and Hazumu trying to pick between the two pointless - great stuff. The OVA ended with Hazumu going back to the girl he turned down since his first option was no longer available. It was awful and needless.

Like I said at the start, I did get some level of enjoyment out of it. It looked nice, it wasn't overly perverse - not including an 'Oh, I have an extra hole now! I'd best put three fingers in!!!' scene you'd (or, at least, I expected!) expect to see in a gender swapping story - and there were a few decent episodes. But it's far from a classic, and I advise only those with an interest in A) lesbians and/or B) school girls (all straight males, in short) to watch it. Anyone not interest in one of those two would probably hate Kashimashi.",1245283200,2,3987,4.540389972144847
3522490,2,B001D2650I,"I originally read all the manga volumes of Kashimashi first and enjoyed it very much. When I saw the complete DVD collection I decided to buy it. As I expected, the general plot was the same as the maga, but the story line of the anime was just as great. That is until the last episode. The ending in the manga was very dramatic yet heart warming. The anime ending was rather hackneyed and disappointing. If your interested in this title, I recommend the manga more than this anime.",1235520000,2,482,4.426966292134831
3522491,3,B001D2650I,"This is an anime that is basically a three pronged romance.  A very girly guy ends up being turned into a woman by some aliens that are observing earthlings for their own purposes.  The girls that had a crush on him have feelings that are not changed by his sudden gender switch.  He was fairly femme-like to begin with anyway.  So this turns into an ugly romance love triangle between the three girls - his childhood friend and the girl he was about to confess his feelings to.  And that's what the entire series focuses on.

It has the usual festival, karaoke singing, haunted (school) house, beach and hot tub episodes.  The animation is bright and the character designs are nice enough to look at, although they have a much younger look than even their age suggests.

There are some awkward moments, most notably with Huzumu's father, who is overly delighted to have his son become a girl.  His attempts at getting her in the tub with him, taking naughty pictures and other unparental-like behavior is just disgusting.  It was almost enough to turn me off of the show completely.

The OVA included here kind of turns the last episode on its head so you actually get to see how everything would conclude if it went either way.  It's kind of a chickening out of what was established in the series closure.

For this release, you do get all three of the original discs in a flimsy little case.  It's not a bad price, but the show is not particularly anything revolutionary.  It's entertaining for a romance with a bit of a twist, and its fun seeing how this guy quickly adapts to becoming a girl, but not enough of the story is based around that, and the series quickly becomes a run-of-the-mill school romance.",1225843200,3,1712,4.567213114754098
3522542,5,B001D2650I,"Hazumu is not the manliest of guys. He's feminine, and is always getting picked on for being kind of wussy. One day he is nearly killed when an alien space craft lands on Earth. The aliens attempt to reconstruct his body, but they accidentally make him a girl instead. Now Hazumu has the attentions of the girl he always liked when she was a boy. Hazumu's best friend even starts being attracted to her. This is where the love triangle begins. Hazumu, his childhood female friend Tomari, and Yasuna, the girl she has had a crush on, are caught in a strange love triangle. The trio's friendship will be tested to the breaking point and new feelings will be discovered. In the end, can all of them be happy?

This show has a strange premise, but it's executed very well. All the characters are lovable, fun, and engrossing. The series is animated well and has a good soundtrack. My only real complaint is the English dub. Some of the characters voices aren't bad, but some are terrible. The voice actor for Tomari especially. It's the same voice actor that did Kota in Kanokon. One of the worst English dub actors I've ever heard. Other than that, this series is captivating. After it gets going, the characters grow on you. It's one of those that you like more after every episode. While it starts off kinda above average, it finishes strong and emotional.

I really enjoyed this anime. It has comedy, drama, and romance. That's about all you could hope for with a series like this. I recommend it to viewers 13 and up. There is a bit of language, fan service and some perverted stuff, especially from Hazumu's Dad. Overall, it's a lot of fun. It's one that you can watch over again and not get bored with it. Kashimashi is a great addition to any anime fans collection.",1357084800,5,1769,4.5423197492163006

Some such as Tomari are not bad but it will take me some time to get used to their new voices.

3522547,2,B001D2650I,"Kashimashi was released in 2006 in Japan, and has a rather budget feel to it. There is little to no background music during the series, and comes accross as rather quiet. It never really picks up and has an old fashioned, rather budget feel to it whilst watching.

I went into this show with no expectations, hoping at least for 20 dollars I would have a decent nights viewing, I was wrong.

Basic rundown of the show being, Boy gets turned into a girl, said boy likes another girl, slice of life elements, boy adapting to life as a girl, random situations, some *Yuri*(Girls love) moments ending with the credits.

Never have I found a series so painful to watch. I'm a fan of drama/romantic stuff, and to be honest this story was awful, there was nothing likable about it.

The english dub is mind dumbingly bad too, this really reflects in the price. For one when you pay under $20 for a new dub(Not a re release) the quality will always be questionable, but believe me, as a dub fan, I have never seen something so awful. I gave this show a few episodes to get going before switching to the Japanese audio.

My suggestion being, if you're a dub fan don't watch this dubbed, the performances are just so ridiculusly bad, and it seems they likely did this to a budget(See price of series).

Rating the dub 0.5 out of 10
Content of the series 2 out of 5(As per Amazons guidelines)",1309392000,3,1381,4.417322834645669

The voice actors I felt were pretty lousy and I ended up watching it subbed . The ending was pretty weak and some of the character developement went backwards , where at the end of the show I liked them less than at the start .
 I really had high hopes for this one after reading the manga , which had won awards and was highly recommended by reviewers . If you're interested in Kashimashi , then trust me when I tell you , buy the manga . You'll end up with a story with great characters and tons of heart , lots of depth , laughs and some real tugs on your heart strings ( I actually shed a few tears , it touched me so much) .
 They could have made a show that could have rivalled Air and Clannad instead of tearing the heart of the story and pushing this hollowed out version onto us. So pass on this dvd and use your money to buy the Kashimashi omnibus vol 1+2 for not much more money and you'll thank me . Just make sure you keep some tissues nearby , it can get pretty heart wrenching .",1305590400,,1109,3.9244444444444446
3522549,5,B001D2650I,"Okay, this is a story that caught my eye from the moment I read the synopsis.  A sensitive young man who, while being egged on by his childhood friend who is hiding her own feelings for him, was crushed by the girl of his dreams, only to get a spaceship right between the eyes and turned into a girl. As s/he starts her new life as a girl, Hazumo learns that being a girl is not as easy as it appears.  New clothes, new behaviors, and of course using the girls restroom is only the beginning.  Her parents are space cases, her best male friend is having a hard time taking her seriously, and not to mention that the alien who ran her over is now living with her, works in her school so he can observe our society, and his ship looks like her and calls her sister-brother.  But then when the girl she liked as a boy actually likes her as a girl, and her childhood friend is fighting the fact she liked him as a boy and can not get over the fact he is a she, someone's heart might get broken.

 The story gives the romantic person a good run, while still giving good laughs. the story is well written, the actors were well chosen, and the dub is right on (and you can hear it in japanese with titles if yu want to hear the orignial soundtrack).  give this one a watch, it is worth it.",1304985600,5,1282,4.083665338645418
3522550,5,B001D2650I,"Hazumu was an ordinary (if somewhat effeminite) high school boy who one day worked up the courage to ask out Yasuna, the most beautiful girl at his school, only for her to turn him down. Depressed, Hazumu wandered off to the hills just outside town...and then an alien spaceship came crashing down right on him! The aliens worked quickly to repair his body and save him from death, but they made one big blunder: they turned Hazumu into a girl! Now Hazumu must learn to live his life as the fairer sex. Thankfully for him that's not too difficult, since his personality was pretty feminine to begin with. Yasuna actually finds herself more attracted to Hazumu now that he's a she. But things get complicated when Hazumu's childhood gal pal, the tomboyish Tomari, finds herself falling for Hazumu as well. And then there's the matter of two of the aliens who've decided to stay in town awhile...

Lately alot of shows that were originally released Japanese-language only are getting re-released on bilingual format. (Such as BLUE DROP and CLANNAD.) I think it's really wonderful, since now both types of anime fans (purists and dub lovers) can watch the show however they want.

There are voice actor interviews, however they are all with the Japanese voice actors, none of the Americans are interviewed. Ah well, I guess you just have to be happy with what you can have.",1304035200,3,1370,4.776371308016878

8291308,5,B001D2650I,"This is a (not professional-I don't write reviews really ever) review of the series ""Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl""

  ***I'd like to point out that this is indeed the WHOLE SERIES, including EPISODE 13/the OVA, whatever you like to call it. No need to worry about not having the actual conclusion.***

  I bought this knowing that I love Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl, because I first watched it on some illegal anime streaming site. I knew I had to buy it some day. To put it briefly, this series is a cute, funny, and at times serious romance slice of life anime. The characters are all like-able, different, and contribute to the story and/or comedy. The romance is good, the drama is not forced at all, and it is very funny. However I wouldn't say it's worth watching just for the comedy, as it is very often sprinkled with serious moments that require you to care for the characters to get sucked into and enjoy. It's a good thing that this anime does that so well, so that isn't a problem for me.

  Basically this is a must buy for shoujo-ai (girl's love) fans, and a good try if you are into cute romantic comedies with some drama blended in. My rating is a very easily given 5/5.",1449100800,3,1185,4.449074074074074

It isn't just that the anime changes the story - which it does - it is that it takes the ""easy"" way out of the plot.  The ending is incredibly disappointing - it loses most of its charm and depth.

If you've seen the early episodes - which are actually very good - don't be fooled.  Around disk two, this adaptation jumps the proverbial shark, goes off the rails, and runs into a brick wall.
