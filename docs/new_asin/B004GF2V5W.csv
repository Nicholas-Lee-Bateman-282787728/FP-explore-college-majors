8428685,5,B004GF2V5W,"I was at this concert that was professionally filmed in Mountain View, California during the 1991 Yes Union tour.  Really nice performance from this lineup of Yes.  Some of the highlights include Yours is no disgrace, Heart of the Sunrise, Owner of a Lonely Heart (especially Rick Wakeman's solo), Awaken and Trevor Rabin and Steve Howe's guitar solos from that night.  The video and audio quality are top notch.  The eight man lineup featured on this dvd includes Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Kaye/Rabin/Squire/Wakeman/White. Taken from the final night of the tour, this DVD is a must have for any fan of YES.",1305936000,3,603,5.122448979591836
8428686,4,B004GF2V5W,"Rick Wakeman is on record as referring to this tour as Onion, because it made him cry. Made me laugh, actually. At least the Los Angeles concert that was produced and now remastered. Bruford and Wakeman look like they're wondering why on earth they signed on for this. It was clearly a bean counter's assembly. Categorically corporate and as stacked against the possibility of genuine musicking leaning over and taking one and all into its confidence as anything could be. But the videos are telling on so many fronts. Howe's disdain for Rabin is so visible that you can almost feel it if you touch your monitor. In the other videos that are part of this package, Howe never once does anything other than keep his back to Rabin. Anderson, for his part, looks like either Joan Crawford or Heddy Lamar on teh road to Bing Crosby. The formally shot and produced DVD1 is one of Yes's and Anderson's most embarrassing moments. The band is playing exclusively to the camera and teh gallery, and Jon/Joan is a mess, darlings. On DVD2, Anderson is wrapped in some sort of sarong, that frankly makes his ass look fat.
Anyway, the multi-disc collection is worth owning for the other concerts. Each of the other shows, listed as bootleg but actually quite well shot and obviously with the intent of archiving the performances, is a much better show than DVD1. The band is playing the music instead of the cameras and all of the excesses of showboating are gone. Squire, never one to miss a chance to hamfist his way through a setlist, locks himself into the rhythm section and is genuinely amazing with both Bruford and White. And Bruford and White are what set the entire endeavour on an even keel. Bruford would write that the concept of his playing Simmonds electronic drums in counterpoint to White standard kit was a better idea on paper as the eelctronic ones were never reliable, but still it's clear that they are listening to each other. Given that Bruford would go on to work with a lesser drummer, Mastellotto, in the double trio Crim, this is a pairing of great integrity.
Rabin never fit in with this band. In DVD1 he looks like he's auditioning for a David Hasselhoff bio-pic. In DVD2, he's more restrained, a little more focused on the music. There's no denying his contributions to 90125 and Big Generator, both of which breathed new life into Yes. But by the end of the run here in '89, he serves to annoy Howe, and little else. His solos are runs through scales, fleet though they are, and none bear any but passing resemblance to what else is going on musically. He would stay for another studio record, at which point Yes nearly became irrrelevant. His tendencies toward big hair music would have served Bon Jovi better.
Wakeman simply runs up and over Kaye. Not that they are sympathetic toward each other, but it's abundantly clear why no one was ever able to genuinely replace Rick, even Kaye.
For my money DVD2 offers better shows. Yes was petering out and would wallow as an afterthought through teh Nineties as Bruford went back to Crim, Rabin went off to Hollywood, White decamped to BC, Howe to a series of brilliantly crafted solo records, Anderson and Squire wondered what was next. A lot of bad direction and lack of focus. The Peter Max cover CD was relentlessly dull and served only to kick Rabin to the curb. Keys to Ascension and The Ladder were poorly assembled mash ups of studio takes and live segments that had no focus. Neither Yes nor their management seemed to know what to make of the band. THat Magnification should emerge at all took everyone by surprise and offered anyone who loved Yes a proper coda to a career that had brought some remarkable music into the world. The run from Yes album through Going For The One is as strong a run as any band could have creatively assembled. From Drama on, apart from 90125 & BG, their day had passed. Lord knows what to make of the new line up of geezers. Touring with Styx seems sad. in 1989, the writing was on the wall, and so as very nearly their last hurrah, this is a collection worth owning.",1305849600,2,4073,4.588477366255144
