2726456,5,B000M7XRF6,"The Catcher is a baseball team's last line of defense against the offense. The instructions in this video are straight forward and dead on.
Nothing is sugar coated in DRILLS & TECHNIQUES FOR CATCHERS.
If your catcher wants to improve, pick up this DVD and make sure he is diligent about practicing the drills. My son is a 12 year old catcher and has reviewed this over and over and we have seen marked improvement. Make no mistake, the catching position in baseball is not for everyone. But if your catcher is serious about the playing this challenging position, this is the best $25.00 you will ever spend.
HIGHLY ENDORSED!",1245801600,,624,4.681818181818182
2726457,5,B000M7XRF6,"This is one of the best put together instructional videos I have seen. Catchers in baseball are a rare breed. This video captures the type of players catchers need to be. The drills and techniques are most relevant to youth baseball catchers as well as the most competitive school catcher. The drills challenge the catchers and many help conquer any fear of the baseball a youth catcher may have. A lot of the advanced drills are dual purpose drills that not only help skill wise but are beneficial for conditioning. Any Johnny Bench or Yogi Berra wannabes should view this product.
FOUL TIPS WILL STAY IN THE GLOVE AFTER VIEWING THIS PROGRAM!
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1243987200,,668,4.817391304347826

8167012,4,B000M7XRF6,"What I like about DRILLS & TECHNIQUES FOR CATCHERS is the way it flows
combining fundamentals, tips and drills.  An excellent program for
catchers new to the position as well as pertinent tips for those who have played catcher for years.
The drills range from very basic to more complex. Highly recommended for catching prospects 8-16.",1288742400,2,335,4.982142857142857
8167013,4,B000M7XRF6,"Typically in Little League baseball catchers are somehow
drawn to that position. And from what I've seen those
that are catchers at 12 who continue to play, most remain
there. DRILLS & TECHNIQUES FOR CATCHERS will give young players
an excellent introduction to the toughest position to
master on the baseball playing field.  Once the basics are
addressed (ie. stance, positioning etc), the drills reinforce
it all. Interestingly, youth players will enjoy this but those players
continuing at the position numbered ""2"" can refer to this program through
their school baseball days.
This DVD is as good as holding on to a tipped third strike!
OUTSTANDING!

8167014,5,B000M7XRF6,"For the most part I found DRILLS & TECHNIQUES FOR CATCHERS an excellent resource tool for
players who want to improve at the catching position. The real beauty of this program is the way it is structured.
The content is generally for the youth player but it becomes an excellent reference for catchers as they
get older. For instance, the basics are covered ie positioning, stance, defending the steal and more. As the player gets
older, there is an excellent section on framing and the importance of trying to ""influence"" an umpire.
This is highly recommended for players 9-16 years old.

Many of the drills can also be used by school catchers.

Drills for the youth catcher as well as for the school catcher make this great product
the perfect resource for one of the hardest positions in sports. This is absolutely
a must-have item for all catchers as well as all baseball coaches.
Little Leagues should make this required viewing for their league. High school
coaches will also love this. As accurate as a Johnny Bench throw down to second,
this is very highly recommended!",1250985600,,508,4.850574712643678
