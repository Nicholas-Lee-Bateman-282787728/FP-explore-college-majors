""Charlie Brown's All Stars"" culls a number of very funny situations from a couple of seasons of Peanuts baseball comic strips, and the traditionally choppy editing is kicked up a notch to include as many jokes as possible, delivered in the charmingly non-professional style of real kidtalk.  Charlie Brown's demoralized team finally decides to call it quits so they can actually enjoy their summer free of the humiliation of constant losing, and there's some wonderfully playful visual humor whether the kids are splashing (or surfing!) in the community wading pool, skateboarding, or jumping rope (sometimes more than one at a time!).  When Mr. Hennessey offers to sponsor Charlie Brown's team, the team is convinced to stick it out, with the promise of new uniforms being the main reason.  However, Mr. Hennessey welches on the deal when he learns that Charlie Brown's team includes girls and a dog (the league won't allow it), so instead of kicking them off the team, he gives up the uniforms and the chance to play in a ""real"" league.  Charlie decides to keep that knowledge from them and capitalize on the team's positive buzz, and they play their best game ever--which, of course, is lost by a too-confident steal to home by you-know-who.  The news of the cancelled uniforms sets the team on edge further, until Linus reveals Charlie Brown's sacrifice.  Inspired by Charlie Brown's faithfulness, the rest of the team decides to make him a manager's uniform; unfortunately for Linus, the only fabric available is his blanket.  The closing shot reveals Linus and Charlie Brown on the pitcher's mound in the rain, with Linus relievedly hanging onto Charlie Brown's uniform.  The fast pace and laugh-out-loud jokes will especially appeal to adults, I think; adults may even enjoy it more than their kids!  The unique jazz accompaniment from Vince Guaraldi is ever-present and continues to help make the early Peanuts specials in a class by themselves.  The complete package also includes a much more contemporary second feature which pales by comparison, though it is in the baseball theme.  I would pay the price above just for ""All-Stars,"" which earns a definite 5-star rating.",980208000,8,2343,5.057142857142857
7854089,5,6303864228,"Trivia question: What was the 2nd Charlie Brown specail?
Answer: Charlie Brown's All Stars.  I don't remember them showing it on TV that often, but watching the ""blockhead"" try at great lengths to catch that ball  is priceless!  He may not win the game, but he does get offered uniforms by  Mr. Hennessey for his team (but the league won't allow girls or his dog  Snoopy).
Part 2: 26 years later, Charlie's team is still not doing well  in It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown.  New character Leland is cute!  Again, Mr. Hennessey offers the Blockheads the coveted uniforms (this time  on the condition that they win one game).",954892800,3,626,4.722222222222222
