2041934,1,B0001XAKFG,"This could very well be the worse movie ever made. The writing is grade school at best and all the Black characters are over-sexed and mindless. The white character however, is the most rational one. Now there's a surprise. It's interesting how Black people have finally accepted decades upon decades of stereotypes and now regurgitate them for a buck. This movie makes 'Soul Plane' look like a masterpiece. Okay, maybe not, but just the same, bypass this film and read 'The Challenge of Blackness' by Lerone Bennett. There's a chapter in there entitled 'The Task of the Black Artist' that means just as much today as it did back then.",1137456000,8,635,4.781818181818182
2041935,4,B0001XAKFG,"Low budget movie with a great story. Pushes your buttons on race, sex, relationships, marriages, and friendships. Grabs

you on the opening scene and never lets go.",1128988800,3,164,5.074074074074074
2041936,1,B0001XAKFG,"What in the hell was this?  I couldn't even watch the rest of the movie only after watching 20 mins of this crap.  I can't believe I wanted to add this movie to my collection of Black films.  This was nothing but lesbianism and sex.  No story line at all.  Junk, junk, junk. Don't get this movie PLEASE.",1123545600,9,303,4.155172413793103

2041938,4,B0001XAKFG,"With so many murders, one is driven to watch this movie, BUT the characters are simply not believable.  Four stars for the story  but NO stars for the characters.",1110240000,3,162,4.551724137931035

2041941,5,B0001XAKFG,"Is this is your genre -- tension-filled, gritty drama, get ready to need a full body massage after you watch this one.  You will be on the edge of the couch from minute one, as the stakes never stop escalating and the twists keep coming.  Throw in some kinky sex, clever humor, and some unique examination of reverse prejudice, not usually explored... and you've got a recipe for muscle ache.  But in a good way. : ) Enjoy.",1092873600,7,423,4.397435897435898

8017671,5,B0001XAKFG,This movie will have you thinking from the start till the end of watching it . Put the Kids to bed  you and the wife check it out with and glass wine .,1393027200,,151,3.5757575757575757
8017672,4,B0001XAKFG,"Sexy, mysterious and outrageous can all describe ""Skin Deep."" From the first scene you need to be ready for the unexpected. Well put together.",1382227200,,142,4.958333333333333
8017673,4,B0001XAKFG,The movie is much better than you might think. Debra Wilson is fantastic in this and it has enough plot twists to hold your interest.,1369008000,,133,4.36
8017674,4,B0001XAKFG,"THE PLOT WAS REAL INTERESTING, BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS POINTING THE FINGER AT EACH, THE HOT TUB SCENE WAS THE UNFOLDING OF ALOT OF DRAMA..",1362614400,,135,4.666666666666667
8017675,5,B0001XAKFG,"This movie has similarities to the 1987 thriller, ""Fatal Attraction"", starring Glenn Close and Michael Douglas, in that the husband has an affair with a psycho, who's name is also Alex, just like Glenn Close's character. Once the cheating husband finds out who he's dealing with, he's in too deep.  The similarities stop there because this one has a lot more guessing games as to whodunnit and the ending is a straight up shocker.  I thought Steve White and Debra Wilson gave stand out performances.  They played their roles like I've never seen them play before.  Really worth a watch.",1192320000,,586,4.83
8017676,4,B0001XAKFG,I saw this movie a few years ago on cable. I liked it so much I had to own it.,1176249600,,78,2.95
8017677,2,B0001XAKFG,"I'm agreeing with the majority of reviews posted on this movie. It is a pretty terrible flick by any standards. Acting,plot;everything is bad. It's also fairly racist to both black and white people. It is one of those movies that is actually painful to watch.

The only reason that I bought it to begin with is because I like Debra Wilson and I wanted to see her sex scene. That was pretty hot in my opinion. It's the only reason why I still have the movie and the only reason why I gave it two stars.

If you're not into Debra Wilson,then I would suggest staying far away from this one.",1172966400,,587,4.2792792792792795
8017678,4,B0001XAKFG,"This film had a good story/plot, although at times the acting left lots to be desired.  The situations were realistic, but too much emphasis was placed on serveral aspects and should have been toned down a bit.

Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to others.",1171929600,,274,4.6875
