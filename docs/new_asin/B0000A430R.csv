Maybe imagine that 80% of America's population are unemployed? What would happen if there was no such thing as social mobility in the U.S and all political rights, liberties and economic opportunity applies to less than 5% of the population?...This is Haiti.
Rezistans is an excellent documentary on the struggle of the poor Haitian masses to attain political and economical self-determination.  Sadly, the struggle still continues for the poor Haitian majority which consists 90-95% of the population. Antoine Izmery, was a man of courage. Izmary turned his back on the selfish isolated even racist anti-Haitian ideals of the Bourgeosie class and committed himself not only to Aristide, but to poor Haitian people.  Izmerry died for the cause of real democracy and for the right of political access and power from the poor majority. If Americans depend on Western corporate media outlets like CNN or FOX, they don't have a clue what is really happening to Haiti and that is such a diservice to Americans.  I reccomend this film to many Americans and other foreigners. They need to be informed that Haiti never had a chance for democracy especially for the poor Haitian majority.",1090195200,,1304,5.08411214953271
