I can put it on ""pause"" when I need to be elsewhere and pick up where I left off -- not possible in TV viewing. The recipes are printable; and although I have cooked for years, I am learning so much from viewing basic preparation and cooking techniques I never knew before.  Highly recommended!!",1265068800,4,373,4.405797101449275

3000532,5,B000XBPDYE,"I checked this DVD out of the library, then decided I needed to own my own copy. It's the best cooking class I've ever attended (even better--you can freeze and rewind a DVD. Try asking a cooking teacher in a class to back up.) The recipes are well-thought out (and tasty!), the instruction entertaining and easy-to-follow, and the tone down-to-earth. This show is about teaching you, not entertaining you with catch phrases and wacky food combinations. It acknowledges that you're not a gourmet chef with unlimited time, a pantry full of exotic ingredients, and a kitchen full of gadgets. Instead, they keep it real. Bow-tie clad Christopher Kimball is no one's idea of eye candy, but he's personable and warm, and he keeps the show grounded in the real world by asking questions, making suggestions, and adding to explanations. Everyone involved comes across as a real person, not a celebrity with an inflated ego.
The ""hook"" of America's Test Kitchen is that they try all sorts of different ways of making a recipe for weeks behind the scenes, then show you the ingredients and preparation method that they found made the tastiest result. They also test and rate ingredients (like brands of dark chocolate) and tools (like food processors) and give you recommendations in various price ranges. All the recipes (and some bonus ones) are included on the DVD--just load it into your computer.
For anyone who loves to cook but still has a thing or two to learn, this DVD is a real find. For a beginner, it is a great introduction to the kitchen.",1215388800,37,1544,4.80827067669173

Just enough detail without overwhelming information and every recipe was a hit with my friends an family.  People actually ask me to cook for them now, and hey if the recipe is on the DVD no problem!  Just don't ask me to make something else (LOL).",1361059200,4,383,4.205479452054795

3000539,5,B000XBPDYE,I love Americas Test Kitchen. I never learned to cook until my 30s.  The book and videos are great- they show you how a recipe or product goes well and how/why it doesn't.  Often they explain the science behind it too!  I'm a big fan.  Hooray.,1348704000,,243,4.217391304347826
3000540,5,B000XBPDYE,"I am a big fan of cooking videos and I feel that I have learned a lot from watching them. This disk is called ""Best Weeknight Recipes."" While it's true that nothing prepared here is too complicated to make on a weeknight, not everything quite falls into the category of 30 minute meals. It could have also been called ""Kitchen Basic Training"", and that is really the reason I liked it so much. In addition to offering appetizing meal choices, the recipes teach basic kitchen techniques for a number of standard preparations. Eleven recipes are presented. If you go through them all you will learn to pan-roast chicken, pan-sear a steak or shrimp, and make skillet pork chops. You'll first brine the chicken and the pork to make them juicer when cooked. You'll make pan sauces from the bits left in the pan after cooking the beef and the chicken. There's also a simple beef and vegetable stir fry. This covers a lot of the important techniques to master when making the transition from beginning to intermediate cook and will become the basis later of many more complicated preparations too involved to consider for a quick weeknight dinner.

There is pasta on offer here, too. You'll make pasta Bolognese and pasta with a sauce from uncooked ripe tomatoes (pomodoro crudo). You'll make a skillet lasagna and a classic macaroni and cheese.

To round things out there are buttermilk mashed potatoes and an asparagus, ham, and Gruyere frittata. Because this is America's Test Kitchen there are also product tastings and an equipment comparison. The two tastings are tomato paste and white wine vinegar. The equipment comparison is skillets offered by celebrity chefs. Of course, anyone who has read the America's Test Kitchen cookbooks or watched the PBS show already knows that their preferred skillets remain the stainless steel All Clads. Finally, also included is a folder with printable versions of all the recipes from the videos in pdf format.

If I had any criticism of this DVD, it would be that the focus is so strongly on a range of main meat courses that side dishes are almost completely ignored. There are few vegetables and no salads or desserts. This disk is really teaching you to prepare main courses rather than proposing complete meals. Also, these shows are all taken from the various seasons of the PBS show, so if you already have some of those discs, they may include some or all of these presentations. However, what is collected here is done so well and so thoroughly that I am still giving it five stars. There is nothing I don't look forward to making and some things that I will be preparing over and over.",1340755200,,2632,4.78021978021978

I have referred to the recipes on this DVD several times even though I have the recipes in the book.  It is something different to watch and learn.  I wasn't aware that cooking could be so much fun.",1422576000,2,321,4.3
8227856,5,B000XBPDYE,"If you've ever wondered how to make chicken breasts that are not all dried out this DVD has some solutions to the problem. Everything the America's Test Kitchen produces is meticulously tested so you get the absolute best recipe. I learn so much from watching these shows. Like I learned to chop a shallot properly and used the new information immediately this past week when I was cooking a recipe with shallots in it.

Some of the recipes on this DVD include:

Beef and Broccoli
Pan Seared Shrimp
Decadent Macaroni and Cheese
Skillet Lasagna

One of the things I did not however agree with was their section on steaks. I think paying more for steaks is going to give you a lot more flavor and the texture of a ribeye or filet mignon can't be beat. So I'd say pay a little more for meat and eat soup and sandwiches the rest of the week.

My favorite part of each DVD I watch has to do with Christopher Kimball's witty remarks that always make me laugh. He is a pretty funny guy. I admit I've been a fan of his since I first reviewed The Best Recipe back in 2000.

So if you are looking to learn something valuable about cooking I can highly recommend this.
