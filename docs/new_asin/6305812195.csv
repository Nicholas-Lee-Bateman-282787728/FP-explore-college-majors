1082477,3,6305812195,"This movie is just OK.  Which is bad, because all the good actors involved here could have made a great movie together.  But not.

The story about 3 diverse couples coming together for a school ""60s pageant"" could have been relevant, meaningful, poignant and funny.  It is none of the above. It could be a Lifetime made-for-TV movie.

There is profound sadness in the scene where Beau Bridges' now-middle-aged hippie character is asked to talk to his son's class about Woodstock, but then is not allowed to talk about WHY - no politics allowed - just the fads, fashions, rock & roll - of My Generation. No Nixon. No Viet Nam. Reducing the 60s to tie-dyed butterflies and bellbottoms stripped of political and sociological context.

No *Big Chill,* it's a lukewarm waste of time and talent. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",1147478400,,820,4.863309352517986
1082478,3,6305812195,"This is quite a good cast in service of a so-so story. These three couples have little in common beside the school where they meet at a PTA conference. The acting of Mary Stuart Masterson is first class. In fact the acting of the three female leads keeps the whole thing from descending into a treacly mess. The final scenes with the children performing a school skit to Joni Mitchell's ""Circle Game"" was amazing. I'm a sucker for happy endings and this movie left me with a a big smile on my face",1100908800,2,497,4.354838709677419
1082479,4,6305812195,"When I read the other reviews I was stunned.  Having just seen this movie and looking it up to buy it I cruised the reviews.  What a shock.  Clearly having lived through the sixties and hearing the truth about Woodstock was considered nothing to even be mentioned in their reviews.  This Movie is funny, and it shows how easy it is for people to forget the importance of making a life with another person.  How imperative it is to trust while still laughing outloud.  In no way do I disrespect the opinions of others.  I just don't see how this movie can be considered bland.  You have trickery, twists and turns.  It takes a bit of caring for the characters to like this movie.  With this cast that was not difficult.  It takes some intelligence to understand the plotline but not so much that one must be in MENSA.  It is a rainy day laugh out loud movie for people who understand the jokes from the sixties.  For people who lived through the horrible loss of our leaders in the sixties finally someone has found a way to express it.  Bravo.",1055980800,5,1043,4.392670157068062
1082480,2,6305812195,"The film follows three couples in different stages of their marriages--a pair of newlyweds, a couple who have walked the aisle again after their respective divorces, and a long wedded couple.  The only halfway decent storyline involves the last couple, a couple of former hippies dealing with their kids and sticking to their 1960's principals.  Other than a few good zingers (esp. the one Cybill Shepard says to her stepdaughter in a clothing store), this film never rises to the drama level it's reaching for.",1004659200,4,511,5.0
1082481,4,6305812195,"Sweet but awkward movie about three couples weathering their marital differences and building friendships. The acting was good, but there was something about the writing that left one somewhat unconvinced that these people could grow to care about each other. Cybil Shepard does a creditable job making us care about an essentially unsympathetic character (part of the writing problem). Mary Stuart Masterson turns in her usual natural and thoughtful work. But watch for yet another outstanding performance by Stockard Channing as Iris -- her scene with Beau Bridges on the balcony of the mayoral party displays an emotional intensity and honesty about many-years-married couples.
The movie itself rates a 3, but the performances rate a 5; I therefore give this a 4.",1001548800,3,766,5.286885245901639
1082482,4,6305812195,"A common thread provides the bond that draws three diverse couples  together, ultimately leading to a friendship through which they explore the  foibles of life and love in ""Married To It,"" an engaging look at  contemporary relationships and perspectives, directed by Arthur Hiller.  There's John and Iris (Beau Bridges and Stockard Channing), a jaded social  worker and the wife of many years who sees him through it all, has given  him two children (now preteens) and only of late has come to realize that  he's given up on her and on life in general; Chuck and Nina (Robert Sean  Leonard and Mary Stuart Masterson), an ambitious investment broker and his  wife, a school psychologist; and Leo and Claire (Ron Silver and Cybill  Shepherd), a toy manufacturer and his second wife, a sophisticated woman of  society who is unable to make a connection with his daughter, Lucy (Donna  Vivino).  A school function and commitment to a committee bring them  together, and they soon find that although they each compete in different  arenas of life, they are in the end not so different from one another after  all.  In fact, they soon come to depend and rely upon their newly founded  friendships more than any of them could ever have imagined possible.  Hiller has crafted an emotionally stirring study of want, need and  expectation that will be readily identifiable to just about anyone who has  taken part in the game of life.  And it's skillfully delivered through an  outstanding ensemble cast, highlighted by the exceptional work of Stockard  Channing, a gifted actress who seems to thrive in a project like this.  She  brings Iris to life from the inside out and creates that necessary  connection with the audience that spills over onto the rest of the cast,  all of whom deliver dynamic performances as well, most notably Cybill  Shepherd as the aloof sophisticate who finally realizes what is really  important in life.  But what really makes this movie work is the depth of  character that  each of the actors involved brings to the core of the  story.  It's as if the derive energy and incentive from one another; and  when actors can give as much as they receive, as they do here, it shows in  the polish of the finished product.  That they all worked so well together  also reflects the skill of the director, and Hiller obviously did a  fantastic job of creating an atmosphere in which his actors could excel.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Don Francks (Sol), Jimmy Shea (Marty),  Nathaniel Moreau (Kenny) and Diane D'Aquila (Madeleine).  One of the great  things about the video revolution is that terrific movies like this one,  that for whatever reason go largely unnoticed in theatrical release, get a  second life and with any luck the attention they so justly deserve.  ""Married To It"" is a sleeper you should shout about from the rooftops; it's  a well made movie with exemplary performances, a great story and a terrific  ending.  A film as good as this simply cannot be ignored, because this, my  friends, is what movies are all about.  This is one you have to see and  tell your friends about.",968025600,12,3121,4.801512287334593

7896118,4,6305812195,"I can't believe that Leonard Maltin only gave this movie Two Stars! He said (I Paraphrase) ""Decent cast can't save this pedestiran script."" He also goes on to write how the movie sat on the shelf for two years. He is right. I noticed the copyright on the DVD box was 1993 while at the end credits they said 1991. According to Wikipedia the movie was released on September 11, 1991 (More On That Later) This movie really did it for me.

Ironic, because it is a movie that I would never have purchased had I not by chance ssen it advertised on the back end of an old VHS tape. I bought the movie a couple of years ago and saw it on last night. The opening sequence did it all for me. That is where all of the principle characters were introduced in a six degrees of separation sequence where they literally walk or drive by one another within the space of minutes. Unbeknownst to each other, they will strike up a lifelong friendship that goes through many trying times.

I won't go through each character's situation, save to say that they are broken down into wealthy, upper-middle class, and middle class households. I cared for the characters and while Cybill Sheppard's character was a bit vacuous, even she grew on me at the end. I couldn't help but lament the loss of the World Trade Center as the Twin Towers are shown majestically from what I believe is Staten Island (Please Feel Free To Comment If I'm Mistaken) where the ladies are having their get together mid-way through the movie.

This is certainly a movie I recommend to lovers of romantic comedies. The movies most hilarious moment comes when the kids of John and Iris Morden ask them if they ever ""dropped acid."" They turn to their kids with ""shock"" and say, ""No, we never did drugs in our lives!"" I laughed so hard I almost had tears. Not that they said it, but that it was said with a straight face!

Buy this movie or rent it. It's one of Hiller's best, despite what the critics said about it.
